    "text": "Agricultural soils now hold 23 times the microplastics the world's oceans do \u2013 and humans could be gobbling them up.\n\nPerth's Murdoch University found in a peer-reviewed study that agricultural land was well head of ocean water when it came to playing \ufeffhost to the potentially dangerous plastics.\n\nThe evaluation also found that soil plastics might be exposed to up to 10,000 chemical additives, most of which were unregulated in agriculture.\n\nMicroplastics have been found in human bodies, and are linked to health issues. (Nine)\n\n\"These microplastics are turning food-producing land into a plastic sink,\" PhD candidate Joseph Boctor, who led the study, said.\n\nMicroplastics and nanoplastics have been detected in lettuce, wheat, and carrot crops through various means including plastic mulching, fertilisers, and even being dropped by clouds.\n\nThe study authors said this was \"particularly concerning\" when seen in the context of microplastics being found in human lungs, brains, hearts, blood, and even placentae.\n\nWheat is among the crops found to have contained microplastics. (iStock)\n\n\ufeffMany microplastics have been found to contain bisphenol-A (BPA), which has been linked to health conditions including prostate and brain issues in infants and foetuses, as well as blood pressure and heart disease.\n\nFood Standards Australia New Zealand says Australians have a very low, decreasing exposure to BPA.\n\nBut, Boctor claimed, \"BPA-free does not equal risk-free\".\n\n\"Replacement chemicals like BPF (bisphenol-F) and BPS (bisphenol-S) show comparable or greater endocrine-disrupting activity.\"\n\nBoctor said not only was government regulation slower than both scientific finding and industry use, but that the plastic industry lacked transparency around additives it produced.\n\n\"This makes the plastic crisis unchecked, and human health exposed,\" he said.\n\n\"This review tries to bring this creeping danger under the radar and shine a flashlight on regulators.\"\n\nMicroplastics have also been linked to carrots.\n\nAlongside endocrine disruptors, the review pinpointed other additives in soil such as Phthalates (linked to reproductive issues) and PBDEs (neurotoxic flame retardants).\n\nThese additives have been linked with neurodegenerative disease, the authors said, increased risks of stroke and heart attack and early death.\n\n\"These are not distant possibilities \u2013 they are unfolding within biological systems \u2013 silently and systematically,\" Boctor said.\n\nBoctor is among a number of researchers at the Bioplastics Innovation Hub, launched by the CSIRO and Murdoch University, working on the development of a \"green plastic\" that decomposes properly in soil and water.\n\n\"This review highlights the urgent need for coordinated scientific and regulatory efforts,\" Boctor said.\n\n\"Regulators, scientists and industry must collaborate to close the loopholes before plastic pollution further entrenches itself in the global food chain.\"\n\nThe research appeared in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe .\ufeff",

    "text": "It was a cold call that came at a vulnerable time for Adelaide woman Nikola Cowin.\n\nBack in 2014, Cowin was an out-of-work student, studying a science degree at Flinders University.\n\nOn the other end of the line was a recruiter whose goal was to sign up as many students as possible to the now discredited and defunct tertiary training provider, Franklyn Scholar.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Two charged after shopping centre knife fight\n\nNikola Cowin, pictured with her baby daughter and partner Matthew Smart, says she was unknowingly signed to a student loan by a misleading recruiter. (Supplied)\n\nCowin believes the recruiter obtained her number from one of the popular job websites she was using to apply for work, such as SEEK or CareerOne.\n\n\"They were targeting people who were pretty much jobless, which, looking back on it now, is rather dodgy,\" Cowin said.\n\nThe recruiter offered to sign Cowin up to an online business management course.\n\n\"They were saying it would increase my chances of being able to get work by having that knowledge under my belt,\" she said.\n\nCowin claims the recruiter told her the course was free.\n\n\"They were saying, 'It's government-funded, so there really isn't anything to lose',\" she said.\n\nLike thousands of other students, Cowin was signed up on the spot during that phone call.\n\nCowin said she was a little sceptical at first, and wondered whether the course was a scam, but she was quickly sent her email login and set up with a trainer.\n\n\"I didn't have any reason to really question it. I figured, if it was a scam, it was an elaborate scam,\" Cowin said.\n\nCowin spent the next two years completing the course, while also working on her university degree.\n\nIt wasn't until 2019, about five years after she was first signed up to the Franklyn Scholar course, that she got a nasty surprise.\n\n\"My best friend and I were talking about HECS debts, and I told her what mine was at and she said, 'You've only done a uni course, it shouldn't be that big',\" Cowin said.\n\nHaving not yet hit the income level where compulsory payments would kick in, Cowin had never thought too deeply about her study loans.\n\nAfter contacting her university and the tax office, Cowin was told she had a large debt from Franklyn Scholar, through the VET FEE-HELP (VFH) scheme.\n\nDue to yearly indexation being applied, that debt now amounts to $35,880.\n\nThe news left Cowin shocked and confused.\n\n\"I was thinking, hang on, I wasn't meant to be charged for that course. What's going on here?\" she said.\n\nCowin said she was especially puzzled about how Franklyn Scholar was able to process her debt through the VFH scheme, as she had not signed any forms.\n\nHaving previously gone through the process with Flinders University, Cowin said she knew she needed to sign a Commonwealth Assistance Form (CAF) to apply for the loan.\n\n\"I never signed anything. If there was a (CAF), it was fabricated,\" Cowin said.\n\n\"I started investigating Franklyn Scholar a bit more and found out that they no longer existed - that's when the saga began.\"\n\nFranklyn Scholar was deregistered by the Australian Skills Quality Authority in 2017 as part of a broader crackdown by the watchdog on training providers demonstrating inappropriate conduct.\n\n\"A period of rapid expansion in enrolments across the VET FEE-HELP sector from 2014 has been attributed in many cases to the inappropriate conduct of providers, who used aggressive marketing tactics, including offering inducements and 'free courses',\" a Department of Employment and Workplace Relations document , released last year under a Freedom of Information request by Cowin's partner, Matthew Smart, states.\n\nA Deloitte audit, commissioned by the department, found 86 per cent of Franklyn Scholar students had no online activity between July 2015 and May 2016, and many students had been enrolled without their knowledge.\n\nIn 2017, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) took an education broker that recruited some students for Franklyn Scholar, among other tertiary education providers, to court.\n\nThe broker, Acquire Learning, was found by the Federal Court to have made unsolicited telephone calls to some job applicants for the purpose of enrolling them on the spot and engaged in \"misleading or deceptive conduct\".\n\nIn October 2019, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations agreed to waive the FEE-HELP debts of students of Franklyn Scholar who had not completed their courses.\n\nCrucially, however, the debts would not be wiped for students like Cowin, who finished their course.\n\nCowin said the decision by the department was unfair and needed to be changed.\n\n\"It's a bit unfair to say that just because I finished it, I don't deserve a refund when I didn't know what was going on,\" she said.\n\n\"If I knew what was happening, or the charges that I was going to incur, I never would have finished it.\"\n\nCowin, with the help of her partner, Smart, has been fighting to get her debt waived for the past six years, first lodging a complaint with the VET Student Loan Ombudsman and then making an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).\n\nBoth attempts were unsuccessful, as was her latest request to the Department of Finance to waive her debt.\n\nIn a decision made last month, the Department of Finance upheld Cowin's debt, dismissing her argument that she never signed any loan documents and was told the course was free.\n\nThe department cited findings from the 2016 Deloitte audit of 331 Franklyn Scholar students, which showed CAFs were found for around 95 per cent of cases.\n\nWhile an education department official had been unable to find Cowin's CAF, and Franklyn Scholar's liquidation made it difficult, if not impossible, for her to chase down a copy herself, that did not mean it didn't exist, the department concluded.\n\nThe department noted Cowin should have also received a Commonwealth Assistance Notice at the time, which included the details of her VFH debt, and this would have also made her aware she was signing up to a loan.\n\nHowever, Cowin said she did not received any such notice, which is typically sent by the education provider, either.\n\nThe decision over his partner's debt had come as a hard blow to both of them, Smart said, adding that it felt like the system had failed, leaving them with a large, unjust debt.\n\n\"It's obviously very frustrating. We're young parents now. We don't earn large salaries or anything. We just try and get by,\" he said.\n\n\"It just doesn't make sense. Nikola never signed any forms. Why would she sign up for a double diploma at twice the cost of her uni degree?\"\n\nRegulations require education providers to keep student records on file for seven years.\n\nSmart said the department ought to have take over Franklyn Scholar's record-keeping after the college was deregistered.\n\nA Department of Finance spokesperson told 9news.com.au waiving debts was a \"mechanism of last resort\".\n\n\"Each request is considered on its individual merits. There is no situation which creates an automatic entitlement to a waiver of debt.\"\n\nThe department could not specifically comment on Cowin's case due to privacy reasons, the spokesperson said.",

    "text": "What do you get if you combine an interest rate cut \u2013 and the possibility \ufefffor several more \u2013 with a crisis-level housing shortage?\n\nCommon sense would suggest the answer is obvious: a big spike in property prices.\n\nBut while they're expected to rise following the Reserve Bank's decision to reduce the cash rate to 3.85 per cent on Tuesday, a repeat of the stratospheric surges from a few years ago seems unlikely.\n\nProperty prices are expected to increase following the RBA's interest rate cut, but not as much as what was seen in previous years. (The Age/Luis Enrique Ascui)\n\n\"The upshot is that we would expect property prices to continue rising over 2025 but it is possible that they won't rise as strongly as they did in 2024,\" Cotality head of research Eliza Owen told 9news.com.au.\n\nInterest rates aren't the be-all and end-all for prices, particularly when you look away from Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\"The reduction in interest rates historically has had the biggest impact on higher-end property markets on the east coast,\" Owen said.\n\n\"There's less of a correlation with property markets in Western Australia, Adelaide and parts of Queensland, potentially because they're more tied to things like commodities performance, for example, in WA.\n\n\"And so what we saw during interest rate rises is that Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane actually had really strong performance.\n\n\"There's no guarantee that they'll get back to that double-digit growth just because interest rates are falling now.\"\n\nNationally, property prices rose 5 per cent last year.\n\nOwen says something \"around that or a little bit less\" is on the cards this time around, while AMP forecasted last week that there would be a 3 per cent rise for the year. \ufeff\n\nA more moderate increase will no doubt come as welcome news to Australians hoping to finally buy their first home in the near future\ufeff, but it shouldn't be mistaken for a sign the nation's housing market is getting to a point where it's no longer considered a crisis.\n\nJust a day after the RBA cut rates, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council released its annual report on the state of the housing system.\n\nIt's bleak reading.\n\nWhile there were some silver linings \u2013 affordability is expected to stabilise\ufeff and potentially even improve over the next four years, and social and affordable housing stock is increasing \u2013 the level of overall supply, the main culprit for rising unaffordability for buyers and renters, is in a poor state.\n\nAustralia isn't building anywhere near enough new homes to address the housing crisis. (Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\n\"The supply of new housing is near its lowest level in a decade,\" the report states.\n\n\"177,000 dwellings were completed in 2024, falling significantly short of underlying demand for housing, which was estimated at around 223,000 for the same period.\n\n\"This shortfall added to already significant unmet demand in the system.\"\n\nThe report also found that not only is Australia set to undershoot the federal government's mid-2029 goal of building 1.2 million new homes by some 262,000 dwellings, we're also on track to fail to meet underlying demand for new homes by 79,000.\n\nMarkets are expecting several more rate cuts by early next year, and the federal government's housing policy allowing buyers to purchase their first home with a 5 per cent deposit, which experts say will do little but push prices up further, starts in January.\n\nREAD MORE: Aussie billionaire to give away half of fortune \ufeff\n\nThe Reserve Bank is expected to hand down several more rate cuts in the coming months. (AP/Mark Baker)\n\nOn top of low supply, that seems like the perfect storm for another price boom. So why \ufeffaren't double-digit increases on the cards once again?\n\nOwen says soft economic outlooks, global uncertainty\ufeff and normalising migration levels will all help keep a lid on prices.\n\nAnd ultimately, after years \u2013 and, indeed, decades \u2013 of surging costs, there's only so much Australians can afford to spend on housing.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you can only really have this ever-increasing demand if people can afford to get into the market,\" Owen says.\n\nWhat Sydney's record $750 weekly rent gets you around the country View Gallery\n\n\"And I think there is a scenario where the rate cuts provide a bit of a sugar hit for market values, but they'll ultimately be weighed down longer-term by affordability constraints and the potentially softer economic outlook.\n\n\"It's a mix of headwinds and tailwinds, and obviously it's difficult to know where all of those factors are going to land... but we would expect off the back of this mix of factors that home values would continue to rise.\"",

(ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nLithium's dramatic slump was underlined this month when Liontown received a state government support package in the form of waivers on port charges and tenement fees, as well as a $15 million interest-free loan until prices recover.\n\n\"It's gratefully received from the WA government,\" Mr Goyder said.\n\n\"They recognise it is an early mover industry, and every bit helps while lithium prices are low, but long term I think we've got a very, very good business.\"\n\nAnother former market darling of Mr Goyder's is Chalice Mining, which has slowed development work for its Gonneville palladium-nickel-copper project near Toodyay in WA's Wheatbelt.\n\nHis 7.8 per cent stake was worth $37.5 million at Friday's $1.23 market close, down from a record $9.86 in November 2021.\n\nThe Bullabulling gold mine, 25km south-west of Coolgardie, closed in 1998 when the gold price was $500 an ounce. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nGolden opportunity beckons\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Goyder has turned his attention to gold as the precious metal soared above $5,000 an ounce in Australian dollar terms for the first time this year.\n\nAs chairman of fledgling gold miner Minerals 260, and a 7.3 per cent major shareholder, he played a key role in January's $166.5 million acquisition of the Bullabulling project from Chinese-owned miner Norton Gold Fields.\n\n\"We don't have buyer's remorse,\" Mr Goyder said.\n\n\"After paying $72 an ounce, and given the gold price has risen almost $700 an ounce since we announced the deal, we don't have buyer's remorse.\"\n\nThe Bullabulling mine, 65 kilometres south-west of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, closed in 1998 when the gold price was about $500 an ounce.\n\nA major exploration campaign is underway at the Bullabulling project to expand the known gold resources. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nGeologists have pored over old drilling data and estimate at least 2.3 million ounces of gold remains at Bullabulling, where Mr Goyder believes a mine employing 350 workers could be operational by 2028.\n\n\"There's nothing better than seeing a development go ahead, jobs created, and wealth created for our shareholders,\" he said.\n\nMinerals 260's ASX ticker is MI6, and as one geologist pointed out during a recent field trip, they have been given a \"licence to drill\".\n\nFour drill rigs, and soon to be six, are turning as part of an 80,000-metre exploration campaign to find more pay dirt.\n\n\"There is upside here there's no doubt, that's why we bought it,\" Mr Goyder said.\n\n\"I'm sure once we go through all the studies, the economics are going to look very good.\"\n\nKalgoorlie-Boulder historian Tim Moore holds a copy of the Kalgoorlie Miner newspaper from May 2006 when the Australian dollar gold price hit $900 an ounce for the first time. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nOld mines revived\n\nIt is a familiar story across WA with old mines being dusted off like old newspapers amid this year's record gold prices.\n\nAmong them is the Youanmi mine, about 400km east of Geraldton, which operated from 1987 to 1997 but closed when the gold price was about $450 an ounce.\n\nPerth-based Rox Resources has estimated it would cost $245 million to bring it into production.\n\nRox has told the ASX it will complete a definitive feasibility study by the end of the year with the aim of entering production by mid-2027.\n\nAt nearby Sandstone in the Mid West, WA gold miner Brightstar Resources has taken the first steps to revive mining, which ceased in 2010.\n\nThe company is currently undertaking an 80,000-metre drilling campaign at Sandstone, with plans to restart production in 2028.\n\nIt is funding those works by selling ore to processing plants surrounding its gold deposits at Laverton and Menzies in the northern Goldfields, a practice known as toll milling.\n\nBrightstar Resources produced 4,297 ounces of gold in April from 56,449 tonnes of ore it delivered for processing at the Laverton Mill. (Supplied: Brightstar Resources)\n\nGold's current hot streak has seen even low-grade material become valuable again, highlighted this week at the Mt Fisher mine, a small open pit last mined in 1987 about 120km east of Wiluna.\n\nOld stockpiles, up to 195,000 tonnes of low-grade ore, that have sat at Mt Fisher for 38 years, are undergoing test work for a potential toll milling deal.\n\n\"There's lots of ups and downs in the market \u2026 but the gold price has gone up exponentially in just two years,\" Mr Goyder said.\n\n\"It's a great spot to be right now.\"",

So well done to the Italian wine varieties in this region. \"\n\nBreaking from tradition\n\nMany Australian wineries have been doing it tough.\n\nThere has been a glut of traditional French grape varieties such as shiraz and chardonnay.\n\nFred Pizzini has seen King Valley wines rise to win international acclaim. (ABC Landline: Tim Lee)\n\nNot so in the King Valley, where family-owned vineyards and their distinctive Italian grape varieties and wines have been growing in popularity.\n\nThe valley's high altitude, mountain soil and climate are conducive to producing quality wines.\n\nFred Pizzini's son, Joel, who is the company's principal winemaker, said it made for earthy, savoury, more interesting versions of styles.\n\nThe Pizzini family is one of about a dozen winemaking families of Italian descent in the valley, all of them migrant success stories.\n\nJoel Pizzini showcases some of the Italian varieties in his collection. (ABC Landline: Tim Lee)\n\nFred's father, Arnie, and his three brothers settled in the valley in the 1950s.\n\n\"When we first bought the farm up here, the first thing he did was plant a vineyard of 1 acre,\" Fred said.\n\n\"And then he built his house.\"\n\nFrom tobacco fields to wine country\n\nThe Politini family from Sicily and the Corsini family from Tuscany also arrived in the 1950s and planted vineyards to make wine for their own use.\n\nTheir main crop was tobacco, which flourished on the rich river flats.\n\nWhen the industry rapidly declined in the late 1970s, the valley's farmers shifted to grape growing.\n\nTractors glide through rows of grape vines. (ABC Landline: Peter Healy)\n\nMost took a 10-year contract with prominent wine maker Brown Brothers, but many had already seen the potential of growing Italian grape varieties.\n\nFor the Corsinis, whose cellar door is a majestic stone villa, a family wedding in 1992 launched them into commercial winemaking.\n\n\"My older sister got married and she insisted that she wanted dad's wines at the reception,\" Peter Corsini said.\n\nPeter's father Gino followed a centuries-old family winemaking method that used no preservatives.\n\nLinda Newton, Peter Corsini, Leticia Corsini and Reuben Corsini are part of a multigenerational wine family. (ABC Landline: Tim Lee)\n\nTheir vegan-friendly, non-allergenic wine is made from a range of Italian grape varieties including fiano, sangiovese and dolcetto.\n\nJoel Pizzini said visitors to their part of north-east Victoria, especially Italians, were impressed by the valley's strong Italian culture.\n\n\"It's definitely an amazing drawcard. The beauty of the King Valley is its Italianate culture,\" Joel Pizzini said.\n\n\"It's beautiful tasting lots of different [Italian] varieties, not just different versions of shiraz and cabernet.\"\n\nLegacy grows\n\nSam Politini, 90, is among only a few surviving migrant winemaker pioneers.\n\nHe witnessed fierce fighting between the Germans and Allied Forces in 1943.\n\nIn 1956, aged 21, he followed his brother to Australia for a better life.\n\nSam Politini regularly plays the accordion at his family's vineyard. (ABC Landline: Tim Lee)\n\nOn most days, his fine Italian accordion tunes resonate across the family's picturesque vineyard, where his grandson Jacques Simian is the third generation to take up winemaking.\n\nMr Politini said he was delighted to see the emergence of King Valley wines.\n\n\"I think we are all really excited and also from when we started till now there are plenty more tourists around,\" Mr Politini said.\n\n\"It's really good to work with something that shows your heritage, something that shows where you're from and you can promote it and give it to others,\" Jacques Simian said.\n\nReuben Corsini and his cousin Leticia are also third-generation farmers.\n\nReuben Corsini (left) and his father Peter examine dolcetto grapes. (ABC Landline: Tim Lee)\n\nTheir career choice has helped revitalise the Valley and cater to a growing tourist trade.\n\n\"It's an absolute honour to be able to carry that [tradition] on,\" Linda Newton (nee Corsini) said.\n\n\"Our parents loved it; were passionate about it, and every day you walk into cellar door you've got that connection with them.\n\n\" Now seeing that third generation carry that same passion is just priceless. \"\n\nThe taste of Italy extends beyond wine.\n\nWineries such as the Pizzini's hold cooking classes and festivals that celebrate wine, cuisine and culture.\n\nThe King Valley wine region is home to more than a dozen vineyards. (ABC Landline: Tim Lee)\n\nItalian grape varieties dominate the landscape, including the Pizzini family's vineyards that line the valley's slopes.\n\nSome date back to Roman times, and most can endure tough climatic conditions better than traditional French varieties.\n\n\"As we get more high-intensity heatwaves, high-intensity storm and rainfall events, they're becoming really beneficial for a viticulture adaptation perspective,\" Fred Pizzini said.\n\n\"There's lots of benefits other than just the commercial side of making delicious wines.\n\n\"King Valley is an international name today, which is pretty special.\"\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm AEST on Sunday or stream anytime on ABC iview.",

    "text": "Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have turned up at the French Open to participate in a ceremony honouring 14-time tournament champion Rafael Nadal, symbolising the approaching end of a golden era in men's tennis.\n\nNadal addressed the packed Court Philippe-Chatrier in French, English and Spanish at the event where he had a ridiculous 112-4 win-loss record since winning his first grand slam title as a 19-year-old on debut in 2005.\n\nDuring a 45-minute tribute, Nadal thanked tournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tennis president Gilles Moretton for organising \"this final farewell from, without a doubt, the most important tennis court of my career\".\n\n\"I've experienced everything over these 20 years,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I've had incredible rivals, like Andy, Novak and of course Roger. And of course many others who pushed me to my physical and mental limits. Truly, nothing would have been as thrilling without these long-lasting rivalries that have driven all of us to improve every single day.\n\n\"Roland-Garros is unique, not only because it is a fundamental part of tennis history, but because of all the people who work tirelessly, always with a smile, to make this tournament what it is: unique.\"\n\nIn the stands, along with thousands of adoring fans, were Nadal's family, including uncle and former coach Toni, wife Mery Xisca Perello and son Rafael Jr, who was passed down onto court with his dad before meeting his dad's great rivals after the ceremony.\n\nFrench tennis great Yannick Noah, Spanish NBA champion Pau Gasol, 1998 French Open winner Carlos Moya and Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley were also in attendance.\n\nRoger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray joined the crowd in farewelling the Spanish legend. (Getty Images: Robert Szaniszlo/NurPhoto)\n\n\"To have my three biggest rivals there, in the court with me, meant a lot, no? And at the same time, it's a great message for the world that the \u2026 toughest rivalries probably in the history of our sport are able to be good colleagues, to respect each other,\" Nadal said after an emotional on-court ceremony.\n\n\"You don't need to hate the opponent to try to beat him with all your forces, and that's the message that I think we showed people, we showed the new generations, and in some way that's our legacy.\"\n\nDuring the tribute to Nadal, a video played showing those three rivals of his \u2014 together, the quartet with a combined 69 grand slam titles came to be known as the Big Four.\n\nNadal, who turns 39 next month, retired after last season with his final few tournaments including the only first-round French Open loss of his career, a runner-up finish in Bastad, a second-round Olympics exit against Djokovic back at Roland Garros and a straight-sets loss at the Davis Cup.\n\n\"We couldn't let you leave like that,\" Djokovic said in the taped segment, and then he, Federer and Murray walked out together on centre court.\n\nNadal gave each a hug as they patted him on the back and shared a laugh.\n\nIt was another emotional moment in a ceremony that left few dry eyes in the arena, least of all for Nadal.\n\nThere were plenty of tears shed by the tennis legend and his fans. (Getty Images: Burak Akbulut/Anadolu)\n\nHe did not know for sure they would be there, but he suspected they would be. (Djokovic is entered in the French Open and is scheduled to play his first match on Tuesday.)\n\n\"All the nerves, pressure, strange feelings that you feel when we see each other when we are really rivals, it's completely different when you finish your career,\" Nadal said, addressing world number six Djokovic in particular.\n\n\"At the end, now it's all about being happy about everything that we achieved. At the end, all of us achieved our dreams.\"\n\nWhile addressing his most famous competitors, Nadal made a point to include a credit to fellow Spaniard David Ferrer, who was also in the building and was beaten by Nadal in the 2013 French final during a run of 10 straight trips to grand slam quarterfinals or better from 2012 to 2014.\n\nFederer, Djokovic, Nadal and Murray won 34 of 35 men's majors from the 2005 French Open to the end of 2013. (Getty Images: Tim Clayton)\n\n\"You gave me some hard times on court but I really enjoyed a lot pushing myself to the limit every single day to compete with all of you,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"At the end, tennis is just a game. Sometimes we feel it's a little bit more but I think we understand it's really only a game.\n\n\"So that means [everything] for me that all of you are here. That's a great message to the world that we can be good friends even if we had the best rivalries. Thank you very, very much for everything during all these years.\"\n\nNadal's record haul of majors in Paris was marked with a permanent plate on centre court featuring his footprint in the red clay.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nFederer, now 43, played his last match in 2021 and announced his retirement the following year.\n\nMurray, who turned 38 this month, retired after participating in the Paris Olympics last year and briefly coached Djokovic this season.\n\nDjokovic, who turned 38 on Thursday and won his 100th career title on Saturday, is the only member of the group still active on tour.\n\nThe inevitable is finally catching up with Djokovic Photo shows A shirtless Novak Djokovic gestures. Novak Djokovic is in decline even as he grabbed more tennis history in Geneva. What remains to be seen is whether he still can get through a two-week major with his mind and body intact.\n\nThe Serb has won the most grand slam titles for a man, with 24. Nadal is next on the list with 22, followed by Federer with 20. Murray won three but made eight other finals across all four majors, losing to Federer and Djokovic each time. The Scot also won successive Olympic singles titles in 2012 and 2016.\n\nNadal and Djokovic played each other 60 times, the most matches between two men in the Open era of tennis, which began in 1969.\n\nDjokovic led the series 31-29, taking their final encounter in the second round of the Paris Olympics last year, although Nadal led 8-2 in French Open match-ups.\n\nNadal led Federer 24-16, including 6-0 at Roland-Garros. Nadal led Murray 17-7.\n\n\"They represent a very important part of my tennis career, because in some way, we pushed each other to the limits. \u2026 Always, one of that four was winning the tournament,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"So that, to put it in perspective, never allowed us to stay relaxed or to give us a break in terms of intensity, in terms of the determination [to] keep improving our game.\"\n\nIn something of a passing-of-the-torch moment, world number two and recent Rome Masters winner Carlos Alcaraz greeted the quartet after the tribute.\n\nSabalenka advances\n\nOn the court, top-seeded woman Aryna Sabalenka tore past Russian Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-0, while it was a tough day for the Australians in action, with all three losing.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

The Dax and broader Eurostoxx 600 both fell 1.5%, while in the UK, which has already cobbled together a fairly meaningless trade deal with US, the FTSE was down a more modest 0.2%.\n\nFutures traders on the ASX also took a more sanguine view on the \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again move\", with the ASX SPI 200 down 0.4%.\n\n\"If I were to put a headline on today's story, it would be 'Here We Go Again!'\" Ocean Park Asset Management CIO James St Aubin told Reuters. \"This is Trump turning on the temperature on the tariff conversation with the EU and Apple. \"The markets were hoping that the worst was behind us when it comes to the tariff rhetoric. But in reality, there's still some smouldering embers when it comes to the tariff talk.\"\n\nUS Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, wasn't having any \"smouldering embers\" metaphors, hoping the new threats would \"light a fire under the EU\" in negotiations.\n\n\"Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose,\" as they may have sighed across the Atlantic.\n\nThis morning EU President Ursula Von Der Leyen tweeted she had a good call with Mr Trump and Europe was ready to advance talks swiftly but needed time to reach a good deal.\n\nOver the week, the three US indices were down around 2.5%, while Europe fell 1.6%.\n\nThe ASX, battling its little contrarian heart out, eked out at 0.2% gain.\n\nBond yields were generally higher in the US, Europe and Japan, although a bit lower in Australia, thanks to the RBA's dovish commentary accompanying last week's rate cut.\n\nThe US dollar continued to be sold off against most major currencies, adding to mounting evidence it has lost its lustre as a safe haven when markets get the staggers.\n\nThat helped push the Australian dollar higher to just under 65 US cents.\n\nOil also edged higher on Friday but was down over the week.\n\nGold (+1.9%) held its position as a safe haven, benefiting from another bout of global uncertainty and gaining almost 2% on Friday,\n\nIron ore edged down 1% but continues to wobble around $US100/ tonne.",

    "text": "The problem that the EU has is that, even after weeks of negotiations, it has no clear idea of what, in Trump\u2019s mind, constitutes a good deal, or even just a deal. Trump, as his post indicated, isn\u2019t interested in deals, just a one-sided outcome where his will prevails, with the US making no meaningful concessions of its own. He\u2019s a unilateralist. Trump agreed to delay the tariffs after a \u201cvery nice\u201d phone call with EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Credit: AP The EU has made it clear that the US needs to offer up concessions of its own if it wants a deal \u2013 it is prepared to negotiate but doesn\u2019t want Trump to dictate its trade and tax policies without offering anything in return. It\u2019s prepared to retaliate with \u20ac95 billion ($166 billion) of tariffs of its own if there is no reasonable deal and could also, if forced into a corner, target the big US tech companies. It already has imposed tariffs of \u20ac21 billion on US imports in response to Trump\u2019s 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US.\n\nTrump\u2019s walking back of his threat, or at least putting a hold on it until July 9, is consistent with previous behaviours, particularly in the confrontation with China. Loading He gets impatient with his inability to announce a big deal \u2013 that other countries don\u2019t just fold immediately in the face of his demands \u2013 threatens massive tariffs (145 per cent in China\u2019s case) and then, when cooler heads prevail or the markets respond badly, he blinks. While the US sharemarket slipped only modestly on Friday, bond yields, which are closely watched by the White House, edged up again, with the yield on 30-year bonds remaining above the sensitive 5 per cent level. The dollar weakened again, depreciating 0.8 per cent against the basket of America\u2019s major trading partners\u2019 currencies. It is now down about 9.9 per cent since the start of the year. The EU is America\u2019s largest trading partner, with total two-way trade in goods of about $US975 billion last year. By comparison, the trade with China amounted to $US582 billion.\n\nDisruption to the transatlantic trade \u2013 a tit-for-tat tariff war -- would be very damaging to both economies and could help tip both into recession, but could be particularly damaging to the US if other major economies also responded to Trump\u2019s trade wars with tariffs of their own. Trump\u2019s threat to impose a 25 per cent tariff on Apple products, and Samsung\u2019s, unless they make their smartphones in Americas shows how little he understands about modern sophisticated manufacturing and the near-impossibility of Apple being able to deliver what he is demanding. \u201cI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone\u2019s (sic) that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\u201d he said in the Truth Social post on Friday. Apple, in an effort to tap into India\u2019s vast market aided by significant Indian government incentives, built a manufacturing presence there over nearly a decade.\n\nRoughly 20 per cent of its iPhone are manufactured in India and, after the trade tensions between the US and China exploded this year, the company had planned to use it (and the lower tariff rates the US applied to Indian exports) as the base for iPhones sold into the US. Apple has a vast and complex supply chain. It sources the 2700 or so components of its phones from more than 185 supplies in more than 40 countries, with some components provided by countries with deep specialist skills \u2013 like Japan for cameras, or South Korea for screens. In China, Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn assembles iPhone in massive production facilities. \u201ciPhone City\u201d in Zhengzhou employs more than 300,000 people with a mixture of highly skilled engineers and low-skilled workers assembling the devices. Foxconn has expanded into India, alongside Apple. It would be near-impossible for Apple to replicate a supply chain it has spent two decades developing within America. It could build a high-tech facility, with lots of robotics, to try to replace the low-skilled workers its suppliers employ in China and India, but it wouldn\u2019t have the engineers and would still have to rely on imported components.\n\nIt would also take years, probably at least five, to build the facility and tens of billions of dollars. Its phones would cost Americans two or three times, if not more, what they cost today. All in order to make a product that Apple itself has conceded might be superseded by new types of devices within a decade. Last week\u2019s Open AI\u2019s purchase of artificial intelligence device startup io, which was co-founded by Apple\u2019s former design chief Jony Ive, may be a foretaste of what\u2019s to come. Trump, as his post indicated, isn\u2019t interested in deals, just a one-sided outcome where his will prevails, with the US making no meaningful concessions of its own. He\u2019s a unilateralist. It would almost certainly be cheaper and less risky for Apple to pay Trump\u2019s tariffs than to invest tens of billions of dollars to make second-rate, but very expensive, American-made iPhones sometime next decade. Friday\u2019s social media post, and even Sunday\u2019s about-face, are consistent with the inconsistency with which Trump and his administration have waged their trade wars.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size When Hillary Clinton was US first lady, a furore erupted over reports that she had once made $US100,000 from a $US1000 investment in cattle futures. Even though it had happened a dozen years before her husband became president, it became a scandal that lasted weeks and forced the White House to initiate a review. Thirty-one years later, after dinner at US President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos agreed to finance a promotional film about first lady Melania Trump that will reportedly put $US28 million ($43 million) directly in her pocket \u2013 280 times the Clinton lucre and in this case from a person with a vested interest in policies set by her husband\u2019s government. Scandal? Furore? Washington moved on while barely taking notice. The Trumps are hardly the first presidential family to profit from their time in power, but they have done more to monetise the presidency than anyone who has ever occupied the White House. The scale and the scope of the presidential mercantilism have been breathtaking. The Trump family and its business partners have collected $US320 million in fees from a new cryptocurrency, brokered overseas real estate deals worth billions of dollars and are opening an exclusive club in Washington called the Executive Branch charging $US500,000 apiece to join, all in the past few months alone. The Trumps have done more to monetise the presidency than anyone who has ever occupied the White House. Credit: nna\\miriah.davis Just last week, Qatar handed over a luxury jet meant for Trump\u2019s use, not just in his official capacity but also for his presidential library after he leaves office. Experts have valued the plane, formally donated to the Air Force, at $US200 million, more than all the foreign gifts bestowed on all previous American presidents combined. And Trump hosted an exclusive dinner at his Virginia club for 220 investors in the $TRUMP cryptocurrency that he started days before taking office in January. Access was openly sold based on how much money they chipped in \u2013 not to a campaign account but to a business that benefits Trump personally. By conventional Washington standards, according to students of official graft, the still-young Trump administration is a candidate for the most brazen use of government office in American history, perhaps eclipsing even Teapot Dome, Watergate and other famous scandals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching and writing about corruption for 50 years, and my head is still spinning,\u201d said Michael Johnston, a professor emeritus at Colgate University and author of multiple books on corruption in the United States. Yet a mark of how much Trump has transformed Washington since his return to power is the normalisation of moneymaking schemes that once would have generated endless political blowback, televised hearings, official investigations and damage control. The death of outrage in the Trump era, or at least the dearth of outrage, exemplifies how far the president has moved the lines of accepted behaviour in Washington. Loading Trump, the first convicted felon elected president, has erased ethical boundaries and dismantled the instruments of accountability that constrained his predecessors. There will be no official investigations because Trump has made sure of it. He has fired government inspectors general and ethics watchdogs, installed partisan loyalists to run the Justice Department, FBI and regulatory agencies and dominated a Republican-controlled Congress unwilling to hold hearings. As a result, while Democrats and other critics of Trump are increasingly trying to focus attention on the president\u2019s activities, they have had a hard time gaining any traction without the usual mechanisms of official review. And at a time when Trump provokes a major news story every day or even every hour \u2013 more tariffs on allies, more retribution against enemies, more defiance of court orders \u2013 rarely does a single action stay in the headlines long enough to shape the national conversation. Paul Rosenzweig, who was a senior counsel to Ken Starr\u2019s investigation of president Bill Clinton and later served in the George W. Bush administration, said the lack of uproar over Trump\u2019s ethical norm-busting has made him wonder whether longstanding assumptions about public desire for honest government were wrong all along. \u201cEither the general public never cared about this,\u201d he said, or \u201cthe public did care about it but no longer does.\u201d He concluded that the answer is that \u201c80 per cent, the public never cared\u201d and \u201c20 per cent, we are overwhelmed and exhausted\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOutrage hasn\u2019t died,\u201d Rosenzweig added. \u201cIt was always just a figment of elite imagination.\u201d The White House has defended Trump\u2019s actions, brushing off questions about ethical considerations by saying that he was so rich that he did not need more money. \u201cThe president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable to the president,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \u201cThe American public believes it is absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency. This president was incredibly successful before giving it all up to serve our country publicly.\u201d But saying that he is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable to the president is meaningless since, as Trump himself has long noted, conflict of interest laws are not applicable to the president. Moreover, he has not given it all up; in fact, he is still making money from his private business interests run by his sons, and independent estimates indicate that he has hardly sacrificed financially by entering politics. Forbes estimated Trump\u2019s net worth at $US5.1 billion in March, a full $US1.2 billion higher than the year before and the highest it has ever been in the magazine\u2019s rankings. The president\u2019s sons scoff at the idea that they should limit their business activities, which directly benefit their father. Donald Trump Jr has said that the family restrained itself during his father\u2019s first term only to be criticised anyway, so it made no sense to hold back any more. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hit you no matter what,\u201d he said last week at a business forum in Qatar. \u201cSo we\u2019re just going to play the game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been some burgeoning signs of public pushback in recent days. The gift of the Qatar plane seemed to break through to the general audience in a way that other episodes have not. A Harvard/CAPS Harris poll released last week found that 62 per cent of Americans thought the gift \u201craises ethical concerns about corruption\u201d, and even some prominent right-wing Trump supporters like Ben Shapiro and Laura Loomer voiced objections. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who campaigned with Trump last year, expressed misgivings this week during a podcast with Shawn Ryan, a right-wing influencer, who mentioned all the Trump family business deals that seemed to coincide with the president\u2019s recent trip to the Middle East. \u201cThat stuff kind of worries me,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWell, it seems like corruption, yeah,\u201d Carlson agreed. Trump Organisation executive vice president of development and acquisitions Donald Trump Jr at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha last week. Credit: Bloomberg But while several dozen demonstrators protested outside Trump\u2019s golf club the other night, Democrats are split about how much to focus on Trump\u2019s profit making, with some preferring to concentrate on economic issues. Senator Christopher Murphy has been leading the charge in the other direction, making floor speeches and leading news conferences denouncing what he calls \u201cbrazen corruption\u201d. \u201cIt is unlikely he is going to be held accountable through traditional means,\u201d Murphy said in an interview. \u201cThere are going to be no special counsels; there\u2019s going to be no DOJ action. And so it\u2019s really just about public mobilisation and politics. If Republicans keep paying a price for the corruption by losing special elections throughout the next year, maybe that causes them to rethink their complicity.\u201d Trump had long promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington after years of corruption by other politicians. When he first ran for president in 2016, he excoriated the Clintons for taking money from Saudi Arabia and other Middle East monarchies with an obvious interest in currying favour in case Hillary Clinton won the presidency. But that money went to the Clinton Foundation for philanthropic purposes. The money Trump\u2019s family is now bringing in from the Middle East is going into their personal accounts through a variety of ventures that The New York Times has documented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnston said the Trumps represented \u201can absolute outlier case, not just in monetary terms\u201d but also \u201cin terms of their brazen disregard\u201d for past standards. \u201cWhile we might disagree as to the merits of policy, the president and figures in the executive branch are expected to serve the public good, not themselves,\u201d he said. Trump made a nod at those standards in his first term by saying he would restrict his family business from doing deals overseas. But since then, he has been convicted of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records and held liable in civil court for fraud while the Supreme Court has conferred immunity on him for official acts. In his second term, Trump has dispensed with self-imposed ethical limits. Loading \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to give the appearance that he\u2019s doing the right thing any more,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, founder of Democracy 21 and a long-time advocate for government ethics. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the history of America that approaches the use of the presidency for massive personal gain. Nothing.\u201d Congressional Republicans spent years investigating Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, for trading on his family name to make millions of dollars, even labelling the clan the \u201cBiden Crime Family\u201d. But while Hunter Biden\u2019s cash flow was a tiny fraction of that of Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Jared Kushner, Republicans have shown no appetite for looking into the current presidential family\u2019s finances. \u201cThe American public has had to inure itself to the corruption of Donald Trump and his presidency because the president and his Republican Party have given the American public no choice in the matter,\u201d said J. Michael Luttig, a conservative former appeals court judge who has become a critic of Trump. Trump evinces no concern that people funnelling money into his family coffers have interests in government policies. Some of the crypto investors who attended his dinner on Thursday night acknowledged that they were using the opportunity to press him on regulation of the industry. According to a video obtained by the Times, he reciprocated by promising guests that he would not be as hard on them as the Biden administration was.\n\nAdvertisement",

It means the URC winners, or England Premiership winners, could miss out if they have a bad Champions Cup campaign, yet the door would be open for the Super Rugby outfit that finishes sixth. As a concept, this competition is far more appealing than the Nations Cup concept, and the Herald predicts that supporter interest will be through the roof, with the first edition of the quadrennial tournament to be held in Europe.

    "text": "All six of Sydney\u2019s major suburban train lines have failed to meet punctuality targets set by Transport for NSW, with one in five peak hour services running late in some of the worst-affected lines despite a decade-long project to improve the network\u2019s reliability.\n\nThe worst performing train lines on average in the past five years have been the T1 North Shore and T9 Northern Line, with an average of just 86 and 88 per cent of all services running on time, respectively. It is below Sydney Trains\u2019 benchmark to have at least 92 per cent of peak-hour suburban services arrive at stations within five minutes of their scheduled time.\n\nAnnual performance averages show every train line except for the T8 Airport and South line has not met this target for more than three years. The most punctual train lines were the T4 Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra line and the T8 Airport and South line, with 90 and 92 per cent of all services, respectively, coming on time.\n\nA handful of stations on Sydney\u2019s train network are also equipped with Sydney Metro stations, making them optimal for commuters looking to transfer between train and metro services. For example, Epping station on the T9 Northern Line and Chatswood station on the T1 North Shore Line both serve as popular interchanges for commuters.",

    "text": "The week prior, Donald Trump had been re-elected as US president. With Trump back in the White House, Charter felt it might have an easier time getting regulators on board with a deal than under his predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s antitrust cops, who many felt had been against big deals regardless of their merits. A representative for Liberty Broadband declined to comment. Takeover template Charter already had a well-thumbed playbook for bringing large, billionaire shareholders into its fold. In 2015, it agreed to buy a majority stake in the billionaire Newhouse family\u2019s cable company Bright House Networks from its parent Advance. It paid for the holding with several types of stock and cash. That, along with the more recent Liberty Broadband deal, served as a template for the Cox negotiations. A so-called Up-C structure was used, which allows a closely held company like Cox to go public while keeping some tax advantages.\n\nAdvance, meanwhile, still has seats on Charter\u2019s board and some consent rights, so it didn\u2019t make sense to offer Cox something significantly different from what the longtime partner already had. Eric Zinterhofer, Charter\u2019s non-executive chairman, was tasked with getting the Newhouses comfortable with the idea of a Cox deal, assuring them that the dynamic wouldn\u2019t change when Cox came in. A representative for Advance couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Cox is a 127-year-old company. Credit: Bloomberg As Charter was making preparations behind the scenes, Cox had also been considering its future. Over the previous two years the advantages of scale and scope in cable had become more apparent, as wireless companies lured away broadband subscribers with their own fibre offerings and abundant streamed content emboldened consumers to cut the cord on cable. Cox early last year brought in consultants from McKinsey & Co to conduct a review, including looking at the company\u2019s position in the industry.\n\nWinfrey\u2019s letter, sent months after McKinsey had wrapped up its review, came at the perfect time. In the multipage missive \u2013 which several of the people referred to as a love letter given when it was sent \u2013 he praised the company that the Cox family had built and laid out the strategic rationale for a deal: the added scale from a combination would position them to better compete and enable them to bundle offerings and more efficiently invest in infrastructure. Before deciding to engage, Taylor consulted internal confidantes like Cox president Dallas Clement, and brought in external advisers to determine the best path forward. The company also deliberated whether to canvas the market for other potential tie-ups, but ultimately decided to unilaterally negotiate with Charter. Daily discussions Once negotiations were underway, Taylor and Winfrey stayed in near constant communication, exchanging text messages and phone calls daily. The men had spent years getting to know each other, and wanted to keep as much of the negotiations as possible between the two of them to avoid leaks. Inside Cox, the deal was known as Project Horizon. At Charter it was called Project Cabot for Italian explorer John Cabot, who led voyages to the east coast of North America in the 15th Century.\n\nMeanwhile, Clement rallied Cox\u2019s advisers and put together a five-week plan for due diligence to be conducted on Charter\u2019s operating plan, strategy, capital structure and legal agreements. Advisers flew down to Atlanta to help prep Taylor and other members of Cox\u2019s management team for negotiating sessions, and Cox set a goal of having a formal response to Charter\u2019s term sheet by early May. The deal would unite two of the biggest US cable providers. Credit: Bloomberg Once that response was sent, the two sides reached a handshake agreement within a week. The deliberations were able to move smoothly in part because the people around the table already knew each other well. Citigroup\u2019s Dan Richards and Christina Mohr were among the team advising Charter, while Cox\u2019s bankers included Evercore\u2019s Eduardo Mestre and Dan Mendelow, Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s Derek Van Zandt and Jeff Hogan and Allen & Co\u2019s Ketan Mehta and Nancy Peretsman. Mestre, Richards, Mohr and Van Zandt all worked together at Citigroup, with Mehta overlapping with some of them at the same bank.\n\nByron Trott, whose firm also won a role advising Cox, has been on the Cox Enterprises board for a decade and has known the family for years. LionTree\u2019s Aryeh Bourkoff and Ehren Stenzler have been close to Charter and companies associated with Malone for years. Sweet finish The main discussions were around valuation, how much of the combined company Cox would own and what the breakdown would be between cash, convertible preferred stock and common stock. The Cox family also wanted to have a continued presence in Atlanta, but moving the headquarters there wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker. The combined company, which will be called Cox, will be headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, but keep a significant presence in Atlanta. Last week, Taylor and Winfrey had decided they wanted to announce a deal by Friday morning. They agreed to sprint towards a deadline of 7am. To keep everyone on track the night before the deal, lawyers for all stakeholders \u2013 fuelled in at least one office by a late-night ice-cream order \u2013 agreed to check in with each other every few hours. If at any point they hit an impasse that would keep them from making the deadline, they\u2019d agree to continue over the weekend.",

    "text": "\u201cThe rate cut definitely helped with bidding confidence, and I think it will help the market get even stronger,\u201d Kohli said. Loading The property was one of 1184 scheduled to go to auction in Melbourne this week. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 70.8 per cent from 876 reported results throughout the week, while 63 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate. Elsewhere, an upsizing family beat 11 other registered bidders for a double-storey Gladstone Park home, only ever owned by one family, paying $1.01 million at auction on Saturday, well over its reserve. The home at 16 Goodwood Crescent was listed with a price range of $770,000 to $820,000.\n\nLead agent and auctioneer Phillip Mercieca from Ray White Gladstone Park said it was a \u201cfantastic campaign.\u201d \u201cThe home was very popular with over 90 people through in four weeks.\u201d The property\u2019s spaciousness and five bedrooms were major drawcards with many families interested in the home. The \u201chotly contested auction\u201d had 12 registered bidders, a mix of young families and second and third-home buyers.\n\nThe auction opened at $830,000, just shy of its $850,000 reserve. Mr Mercieca described the bidding as \u201cfierce\u201d. Loading \u201cIn the end, only six bidders were active, with some of the others not even able to get their hand up,\u201d he said. The home sold to a family who had been looking to upsize for a long time. \u201cThey were incredibly excited,\u201d said Mercieca. The vendors who had built the home in 1985 were equally thrilled. \u201cThere was a bit of emotion as it was the family home, but they were overjoyed,\u201d said Mercieca.\n\nThe result shows the strength of the current market, believes Mercieca. Last week the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate for the second time this year. \u201cThe market is alive and well, and demand is outstripping supply at the moment, which is pushing prices up,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, we see more listings come on to meet the demand we\u2019re getting, but we\u2019re definitely seeing more confidence from buyers.\u201d In Brunswick, a single-storey terrace sold at auction for $1.21 million on Saturday, over its reserve of $1.17 million. Records show it last sold for $675,000 in 2012.\n\n48 Frederick Street was listed with a price guide of $1.05 million to $1.15 million. Loading The auction had four active bidders, including two investors - one from Western Australia - and two young couples. \u201cIt is in a really good spot with bigger than average bedrooms and storage,\u201d said lead agent Scott McElroy from Belle Property Carlton. \u201cIt\u2019s also walking distance to the train station, which was a feature that appealed to the bidders,\u201d he said.\n\nThe auction opened with a bid of $1.05 million, and went up in $10,000 increments, then slowed down to $5,000 and $2,500. \u201cIt ended up being bought by an investor from Western Australia who plans to rent it out,\u201d said McElroy. McElroy said that while the recent interest rate cut hasn\u2019t generated an obvious impact yet, he has noticed the market picking up in recent weeks. \u201cWe are seeing more people come through open for inspections and more emails and phone calls,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing quite a few Sydney investors on the phone, too.\u201d PRD chief economist Dr Diaswati Mardiasmo agreed, believing the auction clearance rate shows that last week\u2019s RBA rate cut did work in \u201cnudging some sticky buyers to purchase and make a decision.\u201d",

    "text": "Electricity prices are set to rise for almost half a million households in NSW, south-east Queensland, and South Australia from 1 July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Default Market Offer (DMO), a reference price for electricity set by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), will increase for 475,727 residences and 91,060 small businesses in these states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DMO is updated yearly and acts as a price cap that energy retailers can charge residential and small business customers on default contracts, also known as standing offer contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria also released its DMO on Monday.\n\n\n\nHow much are the increases for residences?\n\nThe costs of electricity will be higher than last year, as the wholesale costs and the price of transporting electricity have risen, according to AER.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AER said retail costs, such as the cost of billing customers, running call centres, acquiring new customers, managing defaults, and the rollout of smart meters, have added to the price hikes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn NSW, residential customers without controlled load will be hit with price hikes of 8.5 per cent to 9.1 per cent, while customers with controlled load will face increases of 8.3 per cent to 9.7 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential customers without controlled load in south-east Queensland will face price increases of 3.7 per cent. Customers with controlled load will be hit with price increases of 0.5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn South Australia, households without controlled loads will be affected by price increases of 3.2 per cent while those with controlled loads will witness a 2.3 per cent hike in prices.\n\n\n\nElectricity prices are set to rise in several states from July, with the Australian Energy Regulator confirming increases of up to 9.7 per cent for households in NSW. Source: SBS News AER chair Clare Savage said the price hikes are \"not welcome news\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know this is not welcome news for consumers in the current cost-of-living environment,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As noted in our draft determination, sustained pressures across almost all components of the DMO have driven these price rises, with wholesale and network costs rising in most jurisdictions between 1 per cent and 11 per cent, and retail costs between 8 per cent and 35 per cent compared with last year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic customers in Victoria will pay about 1 per cent more than last year.\n\n\n\nWhat about small businesses?\n\nSmall business customers on standing offer plans will experience increases of 0.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent, depending on the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in NSW will face increases of 7.9 per cent to 8.5 per cent.\n\n\n\nSmall business customers based in south-east Queensland will witness increases of 0.8 per cent, and those in South Australia will be hit with a 3.5 per cent hike in prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd small businesses in Victoria will pay around 3 per cent more.\n\n\n\nContact your retailer for a better offer\n\nSavage said you can contact your retailer for a better offer below the DMO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I strongly encourage all consumers to avoid staying on an old or uncompetitive plan. Contact your retailer to see if you can get a better offer or shop around,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At least every 100 days, your retailer must tell you on the front page of your bill if they can offer you a better deal.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Will nuclear lead to cheaper energy prices? Experts weigh in\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at financial comparison site Canstar Blue, said switching plans could save consumers hundreds of dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These electricity price hikes will knock the wind out of the sails for many families, just when they thought they'd turned a corner in the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our research shows switching from an average-priced plan to one of the lowest in the market could save you over $400 a year in some cases \u2014 this, for some households, could be enough to mitigate the upcoming price hikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you can't pay your electricity bill, contact your provider straight away and ask what options might be available.

With wait times at the tip stretching to over an hour, Morgan has resorted to burning debris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We just don't have the time to try and get this mud out before it sets,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan is also facing another problem: rodents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have big river rats.\"\n\n\n\nHow concerning is mould?\n\nMould might just seem like a minor annoyance, but it can have serious health consequences, particularly for children, older adults and people with chronic health conditions like asthma or allergies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some moulds contain toxins some scientists feel may have health impacts,\" Associate Professor Nicholas Osborne from the University of Queensland said in a recent article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Others may induce allergic reactions, like hay fever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOsborne said mould in the home could also exacerbate existing health issues such as rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The jury is still out on whether it contributes to individuals getting these diseases in the first place.

Gloves and protective clothing should be worn during clean-up.\n\n\n\nThe Victorian Department of Health advises removing flood-damaged items that can't be thoroughly cleaned or dried, including carpets, mattresses, furniture and wallpaper.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if you weren't directly affected by flooding, mould can still be a problem, especially during times of high humidity. If you notice mould at home, it's important to locate and fix the source of moisture, clean any visible mould safely, and take steps to prevent it from returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, home insurance doesn't cover mould damage. But some policies will allow you to claim if mould damage occurs as a result of an insured event, like flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for people like Kelly Morgan, it doesn't matter. \"The flood insurance \u2014 it has to be addressed. It has to be looked at [by the government],\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Who has $70,000 a year to insure your property?\"\n\n\n\nNSW residents appear to have the mouldiest homes according to a Compare the Market survey.

    "text": "It's never too early to plan, especially for what can be a long and tricky tax return proces.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis financial year will finish in over a month, at the end of June, and Australians will have four months to lodge their tax returns \u2014 preparing for this early may save you time and money.\n\n\n\n\n\nMasoud Habibian, an accountant and tax agent in Australia, said this may be a \"good time to start\" to \"prepare and review\" your tax lodgement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few tips that may help you in preparing for your tax return:\n\n\n\nDouble-check your myGov account\n\nFirst of all, make sure your information in your myGov account is updated, the account is linked to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), and it is working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make sure that all the data, like your bank details and personal information, is updated,\" Habibian said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make sure that you have a strong verification [system] in your myGov ... If it is actually working, and it has been linked properly, [and] you've got access to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make sure that you've got a good and secure access to the personal information and documents within myGov.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, he advised that if you have forgotten your password, changed your phone number or are facing any other difficulties, it's important to resolve them early, as the process may be significantly more time-consuming during tax time.\n\n\n\nFind those old receipts\n\nPreparing all those old receipts as proof for your work-related deductions can also save you time and money on your tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Habibian, finding and keeping receipts of work-related purchases, like \"tools, uniforms, equipment, computer, education expenses, car expenses, donations,\" etc, are important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Gathering] all the receipts and all the documents related to the income and expenses is very important,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A common issue we see is missing receipts or documents, especially for work-related expenses. Make sure that you're storing the receipts digitally.\"\n\n\n\nPrepare your work from home record\n\nIn general, there are two different methods you can use to claim your work from home-related deductions: First, gathering all the information about your expenses for the time you worked from home, and second, providing the total hours you worked remotely to the ATO.\n\n\n\n\n\nHabibian suggests gathering this information as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes it might be a bit time-consuming to find the detailed record of a daily log of the hours that you worked from home, and also evidence of the expenses like electricity, internet, and phone,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This document actually takes more time to collect and provide to the tax agent.\"\n\n\n\nSeparate your personal and business expenses\n\nIf you own a business and have not yet separated your personal and business expenses, this might be a great time to start, as it may take up a lot of your time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Separating your personal [expenses] from the business expenses would be highly important,\" Habibian said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most of the people have their personal and business expenses mixed, and it will take a huge amount of time to separate them.\"\n\n\n\nGenerally, the distinction between personal and business expenses is straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases intended for business use are deductible business expenses, while items bought for personal use are classified as personal expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an item that serves both business and personal purposes, like a laptop or a phone, you can only deduct the portion used for business.\n\n\n\nDocument your other sources of income\n\nWith only one source of income and a limited number of work-related expenses, the tax return process may not take much time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if you have multiple income sources, Habibian said you should start your preparation sooner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have an investment property, you need to gather information,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make sure that you are focusing on the rental property claims as well ... That would actually be a bit time-consuming. You need to have a chat with your real estate agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You need to start from now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same goes for other investments like cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have crypto that is in the radar of the ATO, you need to gather information about it ... If you are trading crypto, you must report it even if you have made a loss,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDon't rush\n\nTax time starts on the first of July each year and finishes by the end of October.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy mid-July, once employers and banks have submitted more information to the ATO, the prefilled data will be available for your tax lodgement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many people rush to lodge on the first of July ... But you should avoid loading these documents too early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This reduces the errors and avoids later amendments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice. You should consult with a licenced professional to make the decisions that are right for you.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "In her first year of university, when Natasha Jiwani should have been revelling in her new-found independence, she started to experience constant abdominal pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I straight after finishing high school, first year of university would get severe abdominal pain to the point where I would wake up with it and go to sleep with it. No one could diagnose what it was.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually, Natasha was diagnosed with Crohn's disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The overall experience was quite different. So, walking into a gastroenterologist waiting room, I'd look around and I was the only one that was in my close to 20's. Everybody else, the average age was 60 onwards, so there was a lot of confusion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCrohn's disease and ulcerative colitis both fall under the umbrella term of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or IBD \u2014 an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the gut.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease can cause inflammation anywhere in the digestive system, though it usually affects the bowels.\n\n\n\n\n\nUlcerative colitis, often referred to simply as \"colitis\", can cause inflammation and ulcers in the colon and rectum.\n\n\n\n\n\nVincent Ho, a gastroenterologist at Western Sydney University, says both conditions cause multiple symptoms including diarrhea and abdominal pain, though to others they remain invisible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People with inflammatory bowel disease may look perfectly fine but are actually suffering from the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, which can be quite severe in many cases and affect their daily life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of Australians living with I-B-D is rapidly on the rise, increasing from 100,000 a decade or so ago to around 180,000 today, according to a recent State of the Nation Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat number is expected to rise to 200,000 in the next 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Ho says the rates of IBD in Australia are among the highest in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over 65, we're seeing more cases, but we're also seeing cases of inflammatory bowel disease in young children as well. And there are a number of cases of what we call very early onset in inflammatory bowel disease where children can get it a younger than six years of age.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ho say, while it's largely unknown how this inflammation arises, we are starting to learn more about its causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some risk factors in the environment include exposure to tobacco smoke, the use of antibiotics, the use of certain drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for example Nurofen, Voltaren, those sorts of drugs. We know that some types of infections can increase the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother risk factor is diet.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne recent world-first pre clinical study, by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, shows how eating just a few meals high in saturated fats, can cause inflammation in the body.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose foods can also weaken the production of a crucial protein called IL-22, which helps fight this inflammation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMice were used in this research, which also reveals something that excited researchers: while saturated fats suppress IL-22 production, unsaturated fats, found in nuts and avocados, actually boost the protein\u2019s production.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ho says this provides immense hope for people living with chronic inflammatory diseases like IBD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that certain types of foods, a high-quality diet, for example, reaching fruit, vegetables, fish, and other fibre sources is considered to be a protective factor when it comes to inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNatasha has found eating well has had a huge impact on her symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know that if I'm living off fast food for a week as opposed to making healthy at home meals, my Crohn's is a lot better in that latter thing because my body's healthier and it's ensuring that my body's not flaring up with what I'm eating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile IBD is a chronic condition with no cure, it can be managed with treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly diagnosis is important, with symptoms including abnormal bowel movements and the presence of mucus or blood in stools, as well as abdominal discomfort, bloating and flatulence.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeanne Raven, CEO of Crohns and Colitis Australia, says greater awareness around I-B-D will also help when it comes to diagnosis, support and treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it's below the belly button, people don't necessarily talk about it. So, a lot of people become quite isolated in trying to manage their conditions. So, we're trying to shatter the IBD silence through raising awareness of and encouraging people to have conversations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNatasha says while there is less stigma and embarrassment around I-B-D than ever before, more people need to talk about it.\n\n\n\n",

Coffee is moving away from being a functional beverage to becoming more of an indulgement. And what we want to do is to get consumers through a journey that they find coffee exciting as food or wine, so that people can actually enjoy coffee and maybe understand the value that they bring to the value chain and to the people that are producing coffee all around the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s talking about a deeper experience, one where coffee sits alongside wine and fine cuisine, with respect for every hand along the supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those hands belongs to Mikael Jasin, the World Barista Champion in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s a familiar face here, brewing with the same meticulous care farmers use when harvesting cherries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt least for me, it's making sure that the approach that I do when I make this coffee is the same standard at least to the approach that the farmers have done to their coffee, the roasters have done to that coffee, and then me as the barista at least maintain the same standard, if not better. So that the customer when they drink it, they can enjoy that coffee to the best potential of that coffee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it\u2019s about preserving the integrity of the bean, from farm to roast to cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sense of duty, he admits, becomes even more intense when he\u2019s making coffee for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCoffee, there's still so many people that are involved in the steps and it's very easy to mess it up. So, when I make coffee - and especially when I make coffee for people, when I make coffee for myself, I'm a bit more relaxed - but for people, I want make sure that I'm serving the best of that coffee .\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it all begins with the farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the volcanic slopes of Bandung, West Java, coffee cherries ripen in the sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is home to Java Halu Coffee, run by Rani Mayasari.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt her booth in Jakarta, she beams with pride.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s taken 15 years to build her farm, empower women, and make it here.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, she\u2019s sharing Indonesia\u2019s story with the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's proof that maybe our world is more better. It's our hope in the coffee industry, our hope, our economy, our politics more better in next year. It's like a medicine for us. It's like a painkiller for us, you know? Because a lot of effort that we already doing in 15 years. So it's like a good food, healthy food, or soulful food maybe for us. So our soul happy, our body happy, so we can make it in these three days.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says serving her first harvest to international buyers is more than a sale, it\u2019s a celebration of identity, resilience, and the soulful joy of good coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung coffee lovers, too, are finding inspiration here.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them, 18-year-old Jamie Elijah Yauw.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s just graduated high school but already dreams of joining the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think every step of the way at the industry is amazing. It's beautiful, it's inspiring, and to be here, meeting people who\u2019ve worked with farmers, meeting people who make the tools we use every day, meeting people explain how they roast their coffee and seeing the effort that people put, or see how much they love, how much they put their whole life into coffee, is so inspiring. Where for me to see people like that, it's just making me awestruck, really.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, the grand finale, the World Brewers Cup 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter three days of intense competition, China\u2019s George Jinyang Peng emerged as this year\u2019s champion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel so very excited and very happy, and maybe a little bit shocked.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith over 50 participants and more on the horizon, the competition mirrors the fast-growing specialty coffee market, especially in producing nations like Indonesia, Brazil, and Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the global coffee industry now generates more than $200 billion in annual revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024 alone, the price of Arabica surged by 58 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd with growing interest in transparency, sustainability, and quality, events like World of Coffee Jakarta are redefining the bean, not just as a drink, but as a story.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Indonesia, that story is just beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it smells like a fresh brew of national pride and global respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Key Points A committee will oversee an 'inquiry into the recruitment methods and impacts of cults and organised fringe groups'.\n\nIt will look at groups using techniques that harm people emotionally, psychologically, financially, or physically.\n\nSome groups are using coercion techniques and the inquiry will consider whether this should be criminalised.\n\nTore Klevjer has seen the destruction done to the lives of many people who have become part of a cult in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president of Cult Information and Family Support Australia is hoping an inquiry into the tactics of cults and fringe groups will bring awareness of the harm such groups are causing and drive change to hold the groups accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Victorian parliamentary committee will oversee the inquiry into the recruitment methods and impacts of cults and organised fringe groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation, which is currently taking public submissions, may have a focus on activities in Victoria, but Klevjer said many of the groups that are likely to be analysed operate in much the same way across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElla George, the chair of the Legislative Assembly Legal and Social Issues Committee overseeing the inquiry, said it was \"not about judging or questioning anyone\u2019s beliefs, religious or otherwise\".\n\n\n\nCult Information and Family Support Australia president Tore Klevjer wants those impacted by the practices of cults in Australia to have recourse for the treatment they are subjected to. Source: Supplied The inquiry's guidance notes state its focus will be \"those groups that use techniques that can harm individuals emotionally, psychologically, financially, or even physically\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt aims \"to understand whether current laws are strong enough to deal with groups that use manipulation or control in ways that can seriously hurt people\".\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge said in her statement announcing the inquiry that \"recent events in the state\" had led to the probe, but did not detail which groups such events involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of Australian news outlets have reported accounts from former members of groups such as Shincheonji and Geelong Revival Centre, who have spoken about alleged coercion and the negative impacts their involvement with those groups had on their lives.\n\n\n\nThe harm caused by cults\n\nWhile Australians have freedom of religion, the guidance notes for the inquiry state: \"Religious freedom does not grant a licence to cause harm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no legal definition of a cult in Australia, but for the purpose of the inquiry, the reference is to groups that use manipulative or controlling tactics to dominate members.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge said some groups use \"practices that can cause significant emotional, psychological, financial, or even physical harm\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are legitimate concerns about the techniques being used by certain groups to attract and retain members, and whether they amount to coercion that should be criminalised,\" George said.\n\n\n\nKlevjer said he saw some of the biggest impacts on young people, who some of these groups often tried to sign up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It pulls their families apart, a lot of times they quit their education, their uni degree, and when they finally leave, quite often, after three or four years, they've got to start again so they're left behind from their peers, their study and their opportunities,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It disrupts their families as well, because they're taught to lie to their parents and to their family. \"It's very disruptive, and it breaks down a lot of trust.\"\n\n\n\nStatus of such groups\n\nKlevjer said many of the groups that may be considered cults or fringe groups are registered charities in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nKlevjer said he would like to see all tax-exempt charities be compelled to make their financial reports publicly available in order for them to demonstrate that funds were being used for \"genuine\" charitable purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said if the groups themselves were not registered charities: \"A lot of cults will have a front organisation as charitable status, and that's where it gets a little bit tricky, too, because a lot of these groups do have different names in different front organisations.\"\n\n\n\nRecruitment and control\n\nThe use of front groups to mask a group's true nature is listed in the inquiry's guidance notes as one of the tactics used by cults and front groups to recruit new members that may be looked at.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther possible tactics that could be considered include 'love bombing', where new recruits are overwhelmed with affection, praise, and attention to create emotional bonds as well as isolating recruits from outside influences and overwhelming them with group activities or doctrine and framing dissenters as toxic or unenlightened.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Ruth was born into a cult. She reveals the sly tactics used to lure in victims\n\nOther possible methods used by cults to control members have also been outlined for those considering making a submission.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include the use of controlling leadership that demands obedience, loss of personal autonomy as members are encouraged to focus fully on a group\u2019s mission, secrecy, deception and emotional and psychological manipulation.\n\n\n\nAddressing the issues around cults\n\nKlevjer said people who feel they have been poorly treated by such groups usually have little recourse and he wanted to see this changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe proposes that religious or ideological organisations should have to publish a statement of faith or belief practices to clearly outline their core doctrines, expectations of members, and any practices that may significantly impact individual autonomy or well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If an organisation is found to have withheld or misrepresented its beliefs in a way that leads to harm, individuals should have legal recourse, similar to protections against deceptive conduct under consumer protection laws,\" Klevjer said.\n\n\n\nIt's understood some groups that are considered cults use the pretext of bible study as a way to bring in new members but fail to fully explain who the group is and what being part of the group will involve. Source: Getty / fstop123 He said often when cults were accused of certain behaviour such as coercion, misrepresentation, or what he referred to as \"personal abuses\" the \"the cult can just turn around, as they often do, and Just say, well, it wasn't our teaching, that was just the leadership you were under at the time, and then just hang someone else out to dry\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also wants to see coercive control laws extended beyond domestic relationships to include cases involving such groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rationalist Society of Australia (RSA) wrote to all states and territories in December, urging them to address coercive control in cults.\n\n\n\n\n\nRSA executive director Si Gladman sent a letter to attorneys-general that said religious cults posed a great danger to the fundamental rights and freedoms of many Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nGladman wrote that \"numerous survivors of cult groups\", including the Geelong Revival Centre and Shincheonji Church, were \"bravely speaking out about the coercive practices and harm they have been subjected to\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These practices are at odds with fundamental human rights norms. Yet, they are all commonplace in certain sections of Australian society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Clearly, religious cults pose a great danger to the fundamental rights and freedoms of many Australians.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE My daughter has joined a cult. I have no idea how to get her out\n\nGeorge acknowledged upon the announcement of the inquiry that coercive control laws were to be considered as part of the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are legitimate concerns about the techniques being used by certain groups to attract and retain members, and whether they amount to coercion that should be criminalised.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic submissions will be taken until the end of July, and members of the public can also provide input through an online, anonymous questionnaire, with public hearings expected to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe committee is expected to provide its report by the end of September 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nShincheonji's Melbourne chapter and the Geelong Revival Church have been contacted for comment.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The problem that the EU has is that, even after weeks of negotiations, it has no clear idea of what, in Trump\u2019s mind, constitutes a good deal, or even just a deal. Trump, as his post indicated, isn\u2019t interested in deals, just a one-sided outcome where his will prevails, with the US making no meaningful concessions of its own. He\u2019s a unilateralist. Trump agreed to delay the tariffs after a \u201cvery nice\u201d phone call with EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Credit: AP The EU has made it clear that the US needs to offer up concessions of its own if it wants a deal \u2013 it is prepared to negotiate but doesn\u2019t want Trump to dictate its trade and tax policies without offering anything in return. It\u2019s prepared to retaliate with \u20ac95 billion ($166 billion) of tariffs of its own if there is no reasonable deal and could also, if forced into a corner, target the big US tech companies. It already has imposed tariffs of \u20ac21 billion on US imports in response to Trump\u2019s 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US.\n\nTrump\u2019s walking back of his threat, or at least putting a hold on it until July 9, is consistent with previous behaviours, particularly in the confrontation with China. Loading He gets impatient with his inability to announce a big deal \u2013 that other countries don\u2019t just fold immediately in the face of his demands \u2013 threatens massive tariffs (145 per cent in China\u2019s case) and then, when cooler heads prevail or the markets respond badly, he blinks. While the US sharemarket slipped only modestly on Friday, bond yields, which are closely watched by the White House, edged up again, with the yield on 30-year bonds remaining above the sensitive 5 per cent level. The dollar weakened again, depreciating 0.8 per cent against the basket of America\u2019s major trading partners\u2019 currencies. It is now down about 9.9 per cent since the start of the year. The EU is America\u2019s largest trading partner, with total two-way trade in goods of about $US975 billion last year. By comparison, the trade with China amounted to $US582 billion.\n\nDisruption to the transatlantic trade \u2013 a tit-for-tat tariff war -- would be very damaging to both economies and could help tip both into recession, but could be particularly damaging to the US if other major economies also responded to Trump\u2019s trade wars with tariffs of their own. Trump\u2019s threat to impose a 25 per cent tariff on Apple products, and Samsung\u2019s, unless they make their smartphones in Americas shows how little he understands about modern sophisticated manufacturing and the near-impossibility of Apple being able to deliver what he is demanding. \u201cI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone\u2019s (sic) that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\u201d he said in the Truth Social post on Friday. Apple, in an effort to tap into India\u2019s vast market aided by significant Indian government incentives, built a manufacturing presence there over nearly a decade.\n\nRoughly 20 per cent of its iPhone are manufactured in India and, after the trade tensions between the US and China exploded this year, the company had planned to use it (and the lower tariff rates the US applied to Indian exports) as the base for iPhones sold into the US. Apple has a vast and complex supply chain. It sources the 2700 or so components of its phones from more than 185 supplies in more than 40 countries, with some components provided by countries with deep specialist skills \u2013 like Japan for cameras, or South Korea for screens. In China, Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn assembles iPhone in massive production facilities. \u201ciPhone City\u201d in Zhengzhou employs more than 300,000 people with a mixture of highly skilled engineers and low-skilled workers assembling the devices. Foxconn has expanded into India, alongside Apple. It would be near-impossible for Apple to replicate a supply chain it has spent two decades developing within America. It could build a high-tech facility, with lots of robotics, to try to replace the low-skilled workers its suppliers employ in China and India, but it wouldn\u2019t have the engineers and would still have to rely on imported components.\n\nIt would also take years, probably at least five, to build the facility and tens of billions of dollars. Its phones would cost Americans two or three times, if not more, what they cost today. All in order to make a product that Apple itself has conceded might be superseded by new types of devices within a decade. Last week\u2019s Open AI\u2019s purchase of artificial intelligence device startup io, which was co-founded by Apple\u2019s former design chief Jony Ive, may be a foretaste of what\u2019s to come. Trump, as his post indicated, isn\u2019t interested in deals, just a one-sided outcome where his will prevails, with the US making no meaningful concessions of its own. He\u2019s a unilateralist. It would almost certainly be cheaper and less risky for Apple to pay Trump\u2019s tariffs than to invest tens of billions of dollars to make second-rate, but very expensive, American-made iPhones sometime next decade. Friday\u2019s social media post, and even Sunday\u2019s about-face, are consistent with the inconsistency with which Trump and his administration have waged their trade wars.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size When Hillary Clinton was US first lady, a furore erupted over reports that she had once made $US100,000 from a $US1000 investment in cattle futures. Even though it had happened a dozen years before her husband became president, it became a scandal that lasted weeks and forced the White House to initiate a review. Thirty-one years later, after dinner at US President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos agreed to finance a promotional film about first lady Melania Trump that will reportedly put $US28 million ($43 million) directly in her pocket \u2013 280 times the Clinton lucre and in this case from a person with a vested interest in policies set by her husband\u2019s government. Scandal? Furore? Washington moved on while barely taking notice. The Trumps are hardly the first presidential family to profit from their time in power, but they have done more to monetise the presidency than anyone who has ever occupied the White House. The scale and the scope of the presidential mercantilism have been breathtaking. The Trump family and its business partners have collected $US320 million in fees from a new cryptocurrency, brokered overseas real estate deals worth billions of dollars and are opening an exclusive club in Washington called the Executive Branch charging $US500,000 apiece to join, all in the past few months alone. The Trumps have done more to monetise the presidency than anyone who has ever occupied the White House. Credit: nna\\miriah.davis Just last week, Qatar handed over a luxury jet meant for Trump\u2019s use, not just in his official capacity but also for his presidential library after he leaves office. Experts have valued the plane, formally donated to the Air Force, at $US200 million, more than all the foreign gifts bestowed on all previous American presidents combined. And Trump hosted an exclusive dinner at his Virginia club for 220 investors in the $TRUMP cryptocurrency that he started days before taking office in January. Access was openly sold based on how much money they chipped in \u2013 not to a campaign account but to a business that benefits Trump personally. By conventional Washington standards, according to students of official graft, the still-young Trump administration is a candidate for the most brazen use of government office in American history, perhaps eclipsing even Teapot Dome, Watergate and other famous scandals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching and writing about corruption for 50 years, and my head is still spinning,\u201d said Michael Johnston, a professor emeritus at Colgate University and author of multiple books on corruption in the United States. Yet a mark of how much Trump has transformed Washington since his return to power is the normalisation of moneymaking schemes that once would have generated endless political blowback, televised hearings, official investigations and damage control. The death of outrage in the Trump era, or at least the dearth of outrage, exemplifies how far the president has moved the lines of accepted behaviour in Washington. Loading Trump, the first convicted felon elected president, has erased ethical boundaries and dismantled the instruments of accountability that constrained his predecessors. There will be no official investigations because Trump has made sure of it. He has fired government inspectors general and ethics watchdogs, installed partisan loyalists to run the Justice Department, FBI and regulatory agencies and dominated a Republican-controlled Congress unwilling to hold hearings. As a result, while Democrats and other critics of Trump are increasingly trying to focus attention on the president\u2019s activities, they have had a hard time gaining any traction without the usual mechanisms of official review. And at a time when Trump provokes a major news story every day or even every hour \u2013 more tariffs on allies, more retribution against enemies, more defiance of court orders \u2013 rarely does a single action stay in the headlines long enough to shape the national conversation. Paul Rosenzweig, who was a senior counsel to Ken Starr\u2019s investigation of president Bill Clinton and later served in the George W. Bush administration, said the lack of uproar over Trump\u2019s ethical norm-busting has made him wonder whether longstanding assumptions about public desire for honest government were wrong all along. \u201cEither the general public never cared about this,\u201d he said, or \u201cthe public did care about it but no longer does.\u201d He concluded that the answer is that \u201c80 per cent, the public never cared\u201d and \u201c20 per cent, we are overwhelmed and exhausted\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOutrage hasn\u2019t died,\u201d Rosenzweig added. \u201cIt was always just a figment of elite imagination.\u201d The White House has defended Trump\u2019s actions, brushing off questions about ethical considerations by saying that he was so rich that he did not need more money. \u201cThe president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable to the president,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \u201cThe American public believes it is absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency. This president was incredibly successful before giving it all up to serve our country publicly.\u201d But saying that he is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable to the president is meaningless since, as Trump himself has long noted, conflict of interest laws are not applicable to the president. Moreover, he has not given it all up; in fact, he is still making money from his private business interests run by his sons, and independent estimates indicate that he has hardly sacrificed financially by entering politics. Forbes estimated Trump\u2019s net worth at $US5.1 billion in March, a full $US1.2 billion higher than the year before and the highest it has ever been in the magazine\u2019s rankings. The president\u2019s sons scoff at the idea that they should limit their business activities, which directly benefit their father. Donald Trump Jr has said that the family restrained itself during his father\u2019s first term only to be criticised anyway, so it made no sense to hold back any more. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hit you no matter what,\u201d he said last week at a business forum in Qatar. \u201cSo we\u2019re just going to play the game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been some burgeoning signs of public pushback in recent days. The gift of the Qatar plane seemed to break through to the general audience in a way that other episodes have not. A Harvard/CAPS Harris poll released last week found that 62 per cent of Americans thought the gift \u201craises ethical concerns about corruption\u201d, and even some prominent right-wing Trump supporters like Ben Shapiro and Laura Loomer voiced objections. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who campaigned with Trump last year, expressed misgivings this week during a podcast with Shawn Ryan, a right-wing influencer, who mentioned all the Trump family business deals that seemed to coincide with the president\u2019s recent trip to the Middle East. \u201cThat stuff kind of worries me,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWell, it seems like corruption, yeah,\u201d Carlson agreed. Trump Organisation executive vice president of development and acquisitions Donald Trump Jr at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha last week. Credit: Bloomberg But while several dozen demonstrators protested outside Trump\u2019s golf club the other night, Democrats are split about how much to focus on Trump\u2019s profit making, with some preferring to concentrate on economic issues. Senator Christopher Murphy has been leading the charge in the other direction, making floor speeches and leading news conferences denouncing what he calls \u201cbrazen corruption\u201d. \u201cIt is unlikely he is going to be held accountable through traditional means,\u201d Murphy said in an interview. \u201cThere are going to be no special counsels; there\u2019s going to be no DOJ action. And so it\u2019s really just about public mobilisation and politics. If Republicans keep paying a price for the corruption by losing special elections throughout the next year, maybe that causes them to rethink their complicity.\u201d Trump had long promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington after years of corruption by other politicians. When he first ran for president in 2016, he excoriated the Clintons for taking money from Saudi Arabia and other Middle East monarchies with an obvious interest in currying favour in case Hillary Clinton won the presidency. But that money went to the Clinton Foundation for philanthropic purposes. The money Trump\u2019s family is now bringing in from the Middle East is going into their personal accounts through a variety of ventures that The New York Times has documented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnston said the Trumps represented \u201can absolute outlier case, not just in monetary terms\u201d but also \u201cin terms of their brazen disregard\u201d for past standards. \u201cWhile we might disagree as to the merits of policy, the president and figures in the executive branch are expected to serve the public good, not themselves,\u201d he said. Trump made a nod at those standards in his first term by saying he would restrict his family business from doing deals overseas. But since then, he has been convicted of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records and held liable in civil court for fraud while the Supreme Court has conferred immunity on him for official acts. In his second term, Trump has dispensed with self-imposed ethical limits. Loading \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to give the appearance that he\u2019s doing the right thing any more,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, founder of Democracy 21 and a long-time advocate for government ethics. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the history of America that approaches the use of the presidency for massive personal gain. Nothing.\u201d Congressional Republicans spent years investigating Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, for trading on his family name to make millions of dollars, even labelling the clan the \u201cBiden Crime Family\u201d. But while Hunter Biden\u2019s cash flow was a tiny fraction of that of Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Jared Kushner, Republicans have shown no appetite for looking into the current presidential family\u2019s finances. \u201cThe American public has had to inure itself to the corruption of Donald Trump and his presidency because the president and his Republican Party have given the American public no choice in the matter,\u201d said J. Michael Luttig, a conservative former appeals court judge who has become a critic of Trump. Trump evinces no concern that people funnelling money into his family coffers have interests in government policies. Some of the crypto investors who attended his dinner on Thursday night acknowledged that they were using the opportunity to press him on regulation of the industry. According to a video obtained by the Times, he reciprocated by promising guests that he would not be as hard on them as the Biden administration was.\n\nAdvertisement",

Joe Schmidt must be wondering if he can genuinely trust Tupou against the British and Irish Lions, because any such act will cost them a Test. That incident will put the Lions wind-up merchants on notice, and it doesn\u2019t take a massive stretch of the imagination to envisage players such as Ellis Genge trying to get under Tupou\u2019s skin. The shame in all of this is that Tupou appears to be a very likely player that everyone is willing to come through this rough period, but that combustibility is a big red flag ahead of a series that will be intense in every phase of play.\n\nClub World Championship will outshine Nations Cup\n\nChristmas came early for Super Rugby over the weekend with confirmation from Europe that the club world championship will finally and miraculously come into effect in 2028. Although the details are yet to be unveiled in detail, the outline of the 16-team comp is extraordinarily generous towards Super Rugby, with the top six teams at least set to be included to face that year\u2019s Champions Cup quarter finalists. It means the URC winners, or England Premiership winners, could miss out if they have a bad Champions Cup campaign, yet the door would be open for the Super Rugby outfit that finishes sixth. As a concept, this competition is far more appealing than the Nations Cup concept, and the Herald predicts that supporter interest will be through the roof, with the first edition of the quadrennial tournament to be held in Europe. This is a big moment for the game, and a brilliant deal for Super Rugby.",

    "text": "The week prior, Donald Trump had been re-elected as US president. With Trump back in the White House, Charter felt it might have an easier time getting regulators on board with a deal than under his predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s antitrust cops, who many felt had been against big deals regardless of their merits. A representative for Liberty Broadband declined to comment. Takeover template Charter already had a well-thumbed playbook for bringing large, billionaire shareholders into its fold. In 2015, it agreed to buy a majority stake in the billionaire Newhouse family\u2019s cable company Bright House Networks from its parent Advance. It paid for the holding with several types of stock and cash. That, along with the more recent Liberty Broadband deal, served as a template for the Cox negotiations. A so-called Up-C structure was used, which allows a closely held company like Cox to go public while keeping some tax advantages.\n\nAdvance, meanwhile, still has seats on Charter\u2019s board and some consent rights, so it didn\u2019t make sense to offer Cox something significantly different from what the longtime partner already had. Eric Zinterhofer, Charter\u2019s non-executive chairman, was tasked with getting the Newhouses comfortable with the idea of a Cox deal, assuring them that the dynamic wouldn\u2019t change when Cox came in. A representative for Advance couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Cox is a 127-year-old company. Credit: Bloomberg As Charter was making preparations behind the scenes, Cox had also been considering its future. Over the previous two years the advantages of scale and scope in cable had become more apparent, as wireless companies lured away broadband subscribers with their own fibre offerings and abundant streamed content emboldened consumers to cut the cord on cable. Cox early last year brought in consultants from McKinsey & Co to conduct a review, including looking at the company\u2019s position in the industry.\n\nWinfrey\u2019s letter, sent months after McKinsey had wrapped up its review, came at the perfect time. In the multipage missive \u2013 which several of the people referred to as a love letter given when it was sent \u2013 he praised the company that the Cox family had built and laid out the strategic rationale for a deal: the added scale from a combination would position them to better compete and enable them to bundle offerings and more efficiently invest in infrastructure. Before deciding to engage, Taylor consulted internal confidantes like Cox president Dallas Clement, and brought in external advisers to determine the best path forward. The company also deliberated whether to canvas the market for other potential tie-ups, but ultimately decided to unilaterally negotiate with Charter. Daily discussions Once negotiations were underway, Taylor and Winfrey stayed in near constant communication, exchanging text messages and phone calls daily. The men had spent years getting to know each other, and wanted to keep as much of the negotiations as possible between the two of them to avoid leaks. Inside Cox, the deal was known as Project Horizon. At Charter it was called Project Cabot for Italian explorer John Cabot, who led voyages to the east coast of North America in the 15th Century.\n\nMeanwhile, Clement rallied Cox\u2019s advisers and put together a five-week plan for due diligence to be conducted on Charter\u2019s operating plan, strategy, capital structure and legal agreements. Advisers flew down to Atlanta to help prep Taylor and other members of Cox\u2019s management team for negotiating sessions, and Cox set a goal of having a formal response to Charter\u2019s term sheet by early May. The deal would unite two of the biggest US cable providers. Credit: Bloomberg Once that response was sent, the two sides reached a handshake agreement within a week. The deliberations were able to move smoothly in part because the people around the table already knew each other well. Citigroup\u2019s Dan Richards and Christina Mohr were among the team advising Charter, while Cox\u2019s bankers included Evercore\u2019s Eduardo Mestre and Dan Mendelow, Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s Derek Van Zandt and Jeff Hogan and Allen & Co\u2019s Ketan Mehta and Nancy Peretsman. Mestre, Richards, Mohr and Van Zandt all worked together at Citigroup, with Mehta overlapping with some of them at the same bank.\n\nByron Trott, whose firm also won a role advising Cox, has been on the Cox Enterprises board for a decade and has known the family for years. LionTree\u2019s Aryeh Bourkoff and Ehren Stenzler have been close to Charter and companies associated with Malone for years. Sweet finish The main discussions were around valuation, how much of the combined company Cox would own and what the breakdown would be between cash, convertible preferred stock and common stock. The Cox family also wanted to have a continued presence in Atlanta, but moving the headquarters there wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker. The combined company, which will be called Cox, will be headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, but keep a significant presence in Atlanta. Last week, Taylor and Winfrey had decided they wanted to announce a deal by Friday morning. They agreed to sprint towards a deadline of 7am. To keep everyone on track the night before the deal, lawyers for all stakeholders \u2013 fuelled in at least one office by a late-night ice-cream order \u2013 agreed to check in with each other every few hours. If at any point they hit an impasse that would keep them from making the deadline, they\u2019d agree to continue over the weekend.",

    "text": "\u201cThe rate cut definitely helped with bidding confidence, and I think it will help the market get even stronger,\u201d Kohli said. Loading The property was one of 1184 scheduled to go to auction in Melbourne this week. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 70.8 per cent from 876 reported results throughout the week, while 63 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate. Elsewhere, an upsizing family beat 11 other registered bidders for a double-storey Gladstone Park home, only ever owned by one family, paying $1.01 million at auction on Saturday, well over its reserve. The home at 16 Goodwood Crescent was listed with a price range of $770,000 to $820,000.\n\nLead agent and auctioneer Phillip Mercieca from Ray White Gladstone Park said it was a \u201cfantastic campaign.\u201d \u201cThe home was very popular with over 90 people through in four weeks.\u201d The property\u2019s spaciousness and five bedrooms were major drawcards with many families interested in the home. The \u201chotly contested auction\u201d had 12 registered bidders, a mix of young families and second and third-home buyers.\n\nThe auction opened at $830,000, just shy of its $850,000 reserve. Mr Mercieca described the bidding as \u201cfierce\u201d. Loading \u201cIn the end, only six bidders were active, with some of the others not even able to get their hand up,\u201d he said. The home sold to a family who had been looking to upsize for a long time. \u201cThey were incredibly excited,\u201d said Mercieca. The vendors who had built the home in 1985 were equally thrilled. \u201cThere was a bit of emotion as it was the family home, but they were overjoyed,\u201d said Mercieca.\n\nThe result shows the strength of the current market, believes Mercieca. Last week the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate for the second time this year. \u201cThe market is alive and well, and demand is outstripping supply at the moment, which is pushing prices up,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, we see more listings come on to meet the demand we\u2019re getting, but we\u2019re definitely seeing more confidence from buyers.\u201d In Brunswick, a single-storey terrace sold at auction for $1.21 million on Saturday, over its reserve of $1.17 million. Records show it last sold for $675,000 in 2012.\n\n48 Frederick Street was listed with a price guide of $1.05 million to $1.15 million. Loading The auction had four active bidders, including two investors - one from Western Australia - and two young couples. \u201cIt is in a really good spot with bigger than average bedrooms and storage,\u201d said lead agent Scott McElroy from Belle Property Carlton. \u201cIt\u2019s also walking distance to the train station, which was a feature that appealed to the bidders,\u201d he said.\n\nThe auction opened with a bid of $1.05 million, and went up in $10,000 increments, then slowed down to $5,000 and $2,500. \u201cIt ended up being bought by an investor from Western Australia who plans to rent it out,\u201d said McElroy. McElroy said that while the recent interest rate cut hasn\u2019t generated an obvious impact yet, he has noticed the market picking up in recent weeks. \u201cWe are seeing more people come through open for inspections and more emails and phone calls,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing quite a few Sydney investors on the phone, too.\u201d PRD chief economist Dr Diaswati Mardiasmo agreed, believing the auction clearance rate shows that last week\u2019s RBA rate cut did work in \u201cnudging some sticky buyers to purchase and make a decision.\u201d",

    "text": "Maddi Healey, 20, said her passport was nowhere to be found after her 10-hour flight from Sydney.\n\nInstead of enjoying an overseas holiday she had \"dreamed of for years\", an Aussie traveller was left stranded in an overseas airport for more than 18 hours after her passport went missing on her flight.\n\nMaddi Healey, 20, and her friend flew over 10 hours from Sydney to Guangzhou, China earlier this month, speaking excitedly about their plans to visit The Great Wall. However, as they lined up at the customs desk, Maddi realised her passport was nowhere to be found.\n\n\"We turned the bag inside out and searched my friend's bag. It was not there,\" she told Yahoo News. \"I then noticed a decent-sized rip in the top of my backpack that was not there before leaving for China.\"\n\nPanicked, the pair asked if the plane could be searched for the missing passport. Nothing was found.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Something didn't feel right...By this point, my friend and I had to make the tough decision as to whether or not she would continue the trip solo in the hope that I would recover my passport and meet up with her. We said our goodbyes,\" Maddi said.\n\nAussie stranded in airport for over 18 hours 'in complete despair'\n\nAirport staff instructed Maddi to sit down and that's what she did \u2014 waiting for over 18 hours without WiFi or access to power outlets to charge her phone. She claims she was given little information on what would happen next and that staff were generally unhelpful.\n\nAfter calling the Australian embassy, who were unable to help her as she hadn't yet gone through customs, Maddi had no faith her passport would be found or handed in. She got the impression that stolen passports were a \"very regular occurrence\" in the country from speaking to the embassy, and she sadly resigned herself to the fact she'd simply have to fly home. An airport worker came to her rescue.\n\n\"About seven hours in [ my wait], a lovely man who was working at the international desk came over and offered his help... he sat with me and booked me a ticket back to Sydney... I ended up paying $660,\" she explained, adding the worker forfeited his lunch so Maddi could eat something.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I believe that if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have gotten home the way I did and in such a timely manner,\" she said. \"I was in complete despair, filled with fear and frustration.\"\n\nMaddi finally got on a flight back to Australia after spending 18 hours stranded in a Chinese airport. Source: TikTok/_maddikate\n\nWarning to Aussie travellers as passport theft on the rise\n\nMaddi is now warning Aussies to be \"so careful\" with their passport, urging travellers to \"keep it strapped to you at all times\".\n\n\"Don't assume everyone has the same level of respect for your belongings. Have all your documents photographed and saved in your phone,\" she said. \"I was extremely disheartened that I was missing out on a trip that I had dreamt of for years.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaddi also called for a review of the international system, claiming there needs to be more services that help Aussies who are stuck in the \"grey area\" \u2014 not yet in the country but no longer on the plane.\n\n\"Being unable to be helped by the embassy due to a matter of metres is really hard. I hope no one else has to experience this during their travels.\"\n\nThere has been a significant increase in the number of Aussie passports stolen, with 1,942 reported to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade between 2023 and 2024 \u2014 a 28 per cent increase compared to the previous year.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "The world's richest man, Musk has faced mounting backlash in recent months, now Australians are joining in.\n\nAustralians are pushing back against a new Tesla factory in Adelaide, citing concerns over its environmental impact and boss, Elon Musk. Source: Getty/AP\n\nPassionate residents in the south are pushing back against a plan to build a Tesla factory on a disused community reserve, with locals describing the proposal as \"ugly\", saying it would be a \"planet-destroying temple to billionaires\".\n\nIn April, Marion Council, in Adelaide's southwest, proposed selling Chestnut Court Reserve for a Tesla battery factory, service centre, and showroom, citing the potential financial benefits. However, many residents strongly opposed the plan, sharing concerns over its controversial owner, Elon Musk and the loss of green space.\n\nThe world's richest man, Musk has faced mounting backlash in recent months for his close involvement in the 2024 US election, his personal ties to President Donald Trump, and sweeping cuts to public services in his role as head of the US Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTesla factories and showrooms around the world have recently drawn hundreds of protesters opposing Elon Musk\u2019s political ventures \u2014 a scene Adelaide residents fear could be replicated if the proposed site goes ahead.\n\nThe site of the proposed Tesla factory. Source: City of Marion\n\nWhy are locals against a new Tesla factory in Adelaide?\n\nWhile the Chestnut Court Reserve has remained closed since 2016 due to contamination stemming from historical industrial activity, some 90 per cent of nearly 1000 community consultation responses rejected the proposal. A total of 897 respondents voted against the project, while just 57 were in favour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCommunity members have created a website dubbed \"Trees Not Teslas\" to oppose the facility, stating that it could soon \"bring protests to the area and give the community a bad image\".\n\n\"Clearing this public land will mean removing 58 trees, including mature trees that help cool the neighbourhood and support biodiversity. Once they're gone, they're gone. Replacing these lost trees by replanting saplings does not offset the harm, and new sapling growth can't be guaranteed,\" the site read.\n\n\"The ground contamination, which was exacerbated by previous manufacturing (including car manufacturing) in the area, is larger and more widespread than most realise.\n\n\"Putting a factory on top of it will not help, and promises from private companies to clean and decontaminate public land are ahistorical. The government should, and can, commit to decontaminating the land itself.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMelbourne-based property developer MAB CCT Pty Ltd is behind the proposal to purchase and develop the land at Tonsley, with Tesla lined up as a long-term tenant.\n\nWhile much of the focus has been on Chestnut Court Reserve, it represents only a small portion of the total land the developer aims to acquire. To progress the deal, the City of Marion is currently applying to the South Australian Government to revoke Chestnut Court Reserve\u2019s classification as \"community land\", a necessary step before it can be sold. Supporters of the project, including Marion\u2019s mayor, said it will generate around 100 jobs and bring economic benefits to the area.\n\nProtesters against the Tesla Battery Factory plans for Chestnut Court Reserve. Source: The Adelaide Advertiser\n\nBut City of Marion councillor Sarah Luscombe is against the idea. She argued council should look at alternatives.\n\n\"If council wants to do more to activate the land, then it could be put out to open tender to more local companies who could innovate and do something with the land for conservation biodiversity (and) improve tree canopy,\" Ms Luscombe told The Adelaide Advertiser.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe issue is set to be discussed at the next council meeting. Yahoo News has contacted the City of Marion for comment.\n\nDo you have a story tip? Email: newsroomau@yahoonews.com.\n\nYou can also follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube.",

    "text": "With the trucking industry facing massive driver shortages and a lack of young workers emerging, there's one truckie who is seriously breaking the mould.\n\nTruckers have got a bit of a dirty name, says CJ. But she's working to change that. Source: Facebook/Truckingwith CJ\n\nShe might have more than 200,000 followers across social media, but just don't call her an influencer. She's a truck driver who happens to make videos, taking Aussies behind the wheel to show what life is like on the road and behind some of the country's biggest vehicles.\n\nCasuarina Smith isn't who you would expect to be driving big rigs or road trains on mining sites, but she's worked her way up in the industry dominated by older men. At the age of 26 she threw in her job at an insurance company and a \"miserable\" corporate career to follow her dad and sister into the truckie life.\n\n\"We're farmers, turned truck drivers,\" she told Yahoo News Australia of her family. \"There's just no money for the small guys anymore [in farming].\"\n\nThe change from sitting behind a desk to sitting behind a wheel instantly suited her. \"When I transitioned ... I was taking home more money every week from driving trucks,\" she said, recalling that she was \"blown away\" by the potential money that could be made.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBetter known as CJ, some nine years later she's now become one of the most prominent faces in billion dollar trucking industry that is crucial to Australia's way of life.\n\nTruckie breaks the mould to show life behind the wheel\n\nIn a previous trip driving from Adelaide to Coober Pedy when she was still fresh in the industry, her dad came along for the ride and CJ filmed parts of the journey for her own recollection. It helped spark an idea, and eventually \u2013 about two years ago \u2013 she began posting videos of her job because she couldn't see anybody else out there doing it.\n\n\"Typically in our industry we\u2019re not allowed to post anything online,\" she said. \"It's very shunned, and I guess it's seen as a liability.\"\n\nCJ admits truckies can feel a sense of loneliness, but she's trying to create a sense of community with her social media activity. Source: TruckingWith CJ\n\n\"I thought that was really disappointing because how do we encourage other people to get in the industry if we're not actually showing what's involved?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo she went to HR and showed them a video of the trip she drove with her dad and got permission to post about what she was doing on the road.\n\nSince obtaining the \"top licence\" and navigating the world of fuel tankers and road trains she's turned the unique role into a small social media empire and become the de facto representative for a new generation of truckers.\n\n\"I had all these questions that I had no idea about, and I thought if I can learn something and share that with others, then others don't have to feel stupid in asking those questions,\" she told Yahoo. With so many drivers about to retire \"and take that knowledge with them\", CJ is trying to ask as many questions as she can to pass on the insights from older colleagues before it's too late.\n\nWarning over driver shortages in rapidly ageing industry\n\nIt's a service that could prove vital for the hugely important sector. Earlier this month, a report revealed that about 28,000 heavy-vehicle driving jobs went unfilled in Australia last year, prompting truckies to call for an industry overhaul to attract more young drivers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe same report, from the International Road Transport Union, found that nearly half of drivers in the country were over 55 and therefore nearing retirement, while a meagre five per cent of drivers were under 25.\n\nIt's a worrying state of affairs, says Wade Lewis, who is the vice president of the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association.\n\n\"State and federal governments are going to have to step up and say we are going to start putting a lot more focus on this because it's really important we have young people coming through,\" he told the ABC, adding that long-distance truckers can comfortably earn as much as $150,000 a year.\n\n\"We already have a massive, massive problem. Every single trucking company is in trouble with drivers \u2013 they can't get them,\" CJ told Yahoo News about the headwinds facing the industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Truckers have got a bit of a dirty name,\" she said. \"I think at schools, no one encourages someone to be a truck driver.\"\n\nCJ uses a drone to show why not giving trucks space can be a bad idea. Source: Facebook/Truckingwith CJ\n\nTruckie shares major road mistake she sees drivers make\n\nCJ doesn't just share videos relevant for those interested in the industry, but also for everyday drivers, highlighting potential road mistakes that could end in serious disaster \u2013 like trying to overtake a turning truck.\n\nParticularly when she's driving on remote roads where she's able to get a drone up to perfectly illustrate the potential dangers of not giving trucks the requisite space.\n\n\"My god, it happens all the time,\" CJ said. \"There's an overwhelming naivety about how much space we need... People just don't know.\n\n\"People see a tiny gap and jump in it not realising we actually had that space on purpose.\"\n\nIt's advice that is echoed by the Executive Director of the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (NHVR), Michelle Tayler. Speaking to Yahoo News recently, she said the one thing truckers want to convey to drivers is to always remain respectful of sheer power and size of Australia's transport trucks.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got more than 200,000 truck drivers across the country ... and they're on the road all the time,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a two way street... As a truck driver they need to respect the fact that they're in a much larger vehicle and it can be quite intimidating to smaller cars.\n\n\"But also as a smaller vehicle, if you're putting yourself in danger, you're really leaving your life in the hands of that truck driver,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
