We had to play 58 games last weekend. That's as an association and they weren't able to play it.\"\n\nThe torrential rain that battering Sydney also caused a giant sinkhole open up on a sporting oval in Cammeray.\n\nLocals first spotted the sinkhole at Tunks Park on Thursday after another big night of rain.\n\nA sinkhole appeared at Tunks Park on Sydney's north shore. (Nine News)\n\nFields with poor drainage mean the grounds can stay wet and soggy for weeks. (9News)\n\nThe sinkhole was pictured close to the goal posts at the park, which has been completely submerged by water.\n\nThursday was the wettest day of the year to date for Sydney.\n\nThe city's monthly rainfall total reached a record 368.8mm by Friday morning,\n\nConditions eased on Saturday\ufeff and the sun finally made a long-awaited appearance following Sydney's wettest August since 1998.",

(ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nHe said, along with Pelham, there were several other junior players the club had its eye on that could follow in the footsteps of the likes of Fyfe and Smith and make their way to the AFL.\n\n\"There's a lot of talent \u2026 they are sort of half a dozen, I reckon, around the association, they could definitely go further,\" he said.",

This yarn from Cody Atkinson and Sean Lawson is the perfect preview for you as they break down all the big numbers involving the two teams. Key numbers that will settle the epic Bulldogs-Dockers season finale A cool bit of symmetry involving Nat Fyfe C By Chris De Silva Fremantle superstar Nat Fyfe is essentially playing to extend his AFL career this afternoon. In a wonderful little twist, Fyfe's home town team, the Lake Grace-Pingrup Bombers, will also take the field around the same time as the Dockers to keep their own finals hopes alive! As Nat Fyfe plays to keep AFL finals dream alive, his junior club does too How could today's action shape the top eight? C By Chris De Silva Hey Chris looking forward to an exciting finals shaping day I know the main events are the last 2 today and night what implications do they have on the 8 - Bailey OK, let's try and break this all down then. If the Giants beat St Kilda first up, they rise to 64 points, however due to their percentage (115.5), they are likely to finish no higher than fifth. Brisbane, currently fourth, will finish with 66 points to go third on the ladder with a win over Hawthorn tonight. If the Hawks win, they rise to 64 points and their superior percentage of 122.7 would see them rise to fourth on the ladder. Then that Dogs-Dockers match. If the Bulldogs win, they will go to 60 points and due to their percentage of 140.3, could rise as high as fifth. Fremantle would rise to 64 points with a win, but are unlikely to finish any higher than sixth due to their percentage of 108.6. I hope that all makes sense Bailey!

(ABC Riverland: Stephanie Nitschke)\n\nThough she was new to the practice, she says she took to the creative activity like a fish to water.\n\n\"When I was in high school I really enjoyed woodwork. Sewing wasn't available at my particular school, so anything that was to do with making things with my hands, I really enjoyed,\" she said.\n\nIn 2013, while on maternity leave after having her daughter, Elyse, Mrs Tootell turned her hobby into an online business.\n\n\"I put everything together about what I love doing: teaching, sewing, learning,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm a visual learner, so it just happened that making a website and a YouTube channel teaching people how to sew was what seemed to work for me.\"\n\nDomenica Tootell uses social media to teach others how to sew.

(Supplied: Travis Holland)\n\n\"We are seeing people, for example, in regional areas being able to build those global audiences despite being outside the sort of traditional circuits of capital and influence that we might have seen previously,\" he said.\n\n\" You don't have to be in Sydney anymore to be at the centre of Australia's cultural industries, you can be in a regional town. \"\n\nDr Holland said the medium stood out to people looking to turn hobbies into businesses, and despite a drop-off post-pandemic, the number of creators had continued to grow.\n\n\"The trajectory is only [going] up,\" he said.\n\n\"If you can have an audience of even 2,000 people who are regular viewers and engage with your content, but they're scattered all over the world, that's something that would never have flown on traditional media.\"\n\nDomenica Tootell has updated her home sewing room to have storage space for all her supplies.

(ABC Riverland: Stephanie Nitschke)\n\nMrs Tootell's online success has allowed her to establish a bigger creative space to continue to film her sewing content.\n\n\"In the past I've really just worked from our little office in the house \u2026 it was very hard to create in there,\" she said.\n\n\"Having a nice, big space just makes it easier.

(ABC South West WA: Pip Waller)\n\n\"There's some people out there that hate on the sport and they think it's just not good enough,\" Briella said.\n\n\"But I find it really interesting how people just like tip in really fast and swing the car and create lots of smoke.\n\n\" Girls can do the same amount of things boys can do.

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nPhilipsen, who had also taken the yellow jersey at last month's Tour before a third-stage crash ended up ruling him out of the race, enthused: \"Winning is always a nice feeling and definitely when there is a reward like the red jersey, of course it's a nice present.\n\n\"We managed to do our lead-out the way we wanted to. In the final kilometre, they executed it perfectly. I saw 175 meters to go and had to start sprinting, I'm really happy it worked out for us.\n\n\"After my crash in the Tour, I was really disappointed to be out, it was a setback. This was a nice goal, but I knew we only had one chance because there aren't many opportunities for a sprinter like me at this Vuelta.\"\n\nNine of the 10-strong Australian contingent, headed by world road race silver medallist Ben O'Connor (Jayco AlUla) and former Giro d'Italia champ Jai Hindley (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe), safely negotiated the opening day.\n\nBut Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates) had a bad day, bringing up the rear of the field nearly three-and-a-half minutes adrift.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Socceroo teen star Nestory Irankunda has continued his terrific start to life in England, netting his first goal for Watford via a sensational free kick.\n\nThe 19-year-old Tanzanian-born winger, who starred at Adelaide United but didn't make the grade at German champions Bayern Munich, curled a glorious 25-yard free-kick home to give the second-tier Hornets the lead at Swansea in the 35th minute of their 1-1 draw.\n\nBut he had to persuade Moussa Sissoko to let him take the kick, suggesting that his experienced French international captain really ought to take a look at his highlights reels, which feature similar strikes when he was at the Reds.\n\nThe belting strike capped another impressive performance from Irankunda, who proved a real handful for the Swansea defence, including fellow Socceroo Cameron Burgess, all afternoon with his speed and trickery until he was brought off just before the hour as a precaution when he appeared to suffer a hamstring knock.\n\nSnapped up from the Bundesliga giants on a five-year deal, Irankunda had already made a big impression, and was quick to tell reporters how his ambition was to \"make the crowd go wild\" at Vicarage Road.\n\nHe did just that when winning the free kick just after the half-hour, before picking himself up to whip the ball up and over the Welsh side's wall and into the left-hand corner.\n\n\"Oh, my. I've scored some good goals but I reckon that could be in my top five,\" Irankunda said.\n\nWith usual free-kick taker Imran Louza out injured, he took his chance.\n\n\"Obviously, you have to ask for permission, and I said to Moussa, 'I feel confident in taking a free kick',\" he said.\n\n\"He asked me a couple times, 'are you sure you can take free kicks?', I said, 'yeah, go look at my highlight reels!' Then after that, I just put it into the corner \u2026\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWhen Irankunda went off, soon after being fouled by Swansea's new signing Marko Stamenic, Watford's impetus seemed to be lost and Zan Vipotnik came off the bench for the Swans to rescue a point with an 82nd-minute goal.\n\nIrankunda has been enjoying being back in the thick of the action after his confidence took a bit of a hit in Germany.\n\n\"It's been good,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel like myself again, a whole lot more confident. It's fun to come to training every day. I love playing here.\"\n\nHe's not the only Australian making an early-season mark in English soccer's second tier.\n\nPortsmouth midfielder Adrian Segecic again impressed in a 1-1 draw at West Brom, while Sammy Silvera continues to shine for Middlesbrough as a 2-1 win at Norwich took the side joint-top on a maximum nine points from three games, alongside Stoke, who won 2-1 at Southampton.\n\nAAP",

(ABC News: Patrick Rocca)\n\nIt made going to work a weekly struggle.\n\n\"There was always this impending sense of doom that at any moment you could be attacked.\"\n\nMs Simmonds, now 20, said it was the moment she decided to join the retail workers union.\n\nAbout 18 months later, working as the health and safety representative at a different Aldi in Keilor Downs, Ms Simmonds handed out a trades hall safety survey to try and gather evidence for her employer that staff did not feel safe at work.\n\nMs Simmonds was fired for allegedly breaching company policy. (ABC News: Patrick Rocca)\n\nWhen she went back to the staff with the results, she was fired for allegedly breaching company policy.\n\n\"I just wanted to draw attention to the issues retail workers face.

They don't actually deserve to be treated like this and legally they should not be treated like this. \"\n\nMs Simmonds hopes her case will lead Aldi to stop mandatory bag checks by staff.\n\nOn Friday, a worker from Woolworths at Werribee Plaza in Melbourne's west lodged a case backed by the union in the Fair Work Commission.\n\nThey claimed bag checks and new security gates at self-serve check-outs had created \"specific and significant risks of customer and offender aggression\" by \"locking abusive \u2026 and violent offenders into a confined space with employees and customers\".\n\nThe worker and the union want Woolworths to back down on mandatory bag checks and remove security gates.\n\nThe union has called on Woolworths to stop mandatory bag checks by staff. (ABC News)\n\nRetail and Fast Food Worker Union secretary Josh Cullinan said staff were increasingly afraid to go to work.\n\n\"Bag checks are likely to lead to forms of violence,\" he said.\n\n\"Even if it's one in a 100, they've got so many customers [to serve] they have to worry every single time they look in someone's bag: what's going to come next, is it going to be abuse, is it going to be harassment, is it going to be a punch?\"\n\nMr Cullinan said body-worn cameras rolled out by Coles and Woolworths also put staff at risk because they had to tell customers during bag checks when they began recording.\n\n\"It's about putting staff on the front line to stop stock loss, it's not about safety, it's about theft. Having to have a camera strapped to your body that is in your face \u2026 is just asking for trouble. These steps need to stop.\"\n\nA Coles worker wears a body-worn camera in 2023. (ABC News)\n\nAccording to documents from the ACCC supermarkets inquiry last year, abuse, threats, intimidation, assaults and other workplace violence involving Woolworths staff had increased year-on-year since 2014.\n\nRecords of a point-of-sale \"verbal abuse tool\" that allows Woolworths staff to push a button and record verbal abuse instances found they were occurring almost 700 times a week on average, impacting 430 staff members across 233 stores.\n\nDuring the inquiry, Coles reported that from June 2013 to March 2024, about 8,000 cases of customer violence or aggression towards staff were reported.\n\nData from Victoria Police also found retail theft was up 36 per cent across the state in the past year.\n\n\"By putting in place structures to limit stock loss [from] theft, [supermarkets] have been putting our members on the front line and that's what's causing a lot of this hostility,\" Mr Cullinan said.\n\nPolice Minister Anthony Carbines says the government will soon introduce retail worker harm legislation. (ABC News)\n\nPolice Minister Anthony Carbines said the government would be introducing retail worker harm legislation this year, \"that brings serious consequences to those who do harm and assault retail workers\".\n\n\"We need to send a very clear message to the community and reflect the community's expectations that young people and all people who work in our retail sector are safe.\"\n\nAn Aldi spokesperson said the company valued its people and was \"committed to their health and safety\".\n\n\"This matter is currently going through legal proceedings so we cannot comment on the specifics of it.\"\n\nA Woolworths spokesperson said the company treated \"the safety of our team members and customers very seriously\".",

(ABC Central Victoria: Shannon Schubert)\n\n\"It isn't about the city being the story,\" she said.\n\n\" Writers' festivals are risky and they exist to push boundaries, they are there for debate. \"\n\nIn a statement, Greater Bendigo City Council said it intended to \"honour the financial commitments\" to local businesses.\n\n\"The city will reach out to those businesses to chat with them about what that loss looks like,\" Cr Metcalf told the ABC.\n\nBudget papers reveal $2.3 million was allocated for Bendigo Venue and Events in 2024/25, which is a local government arm in charge of all major events.\n\nThe council declined to respond to questions about how much taxpayer funds had been allocated to the festival.\n\nWriter Di Dempsey is worried about the festival's future. (ABC News)\n\nFuture uncertain\n\nGreater Bendigo City Council is yet to confirm if the festival will return in 2026.\n\nBendigo writer Di Dempsey, who attended the festival while expressing solidarity with those boycotting it, said she was \"terrified\" it would shut down permanently.\n\n\"I really hope they don't,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope they use this publicity as a way of turning it around and \u2026 say, 'We're not going to let this happen again.'\"\n\nMr Radford agreed and said it was an opportunity for the festival to come back bigger than ever in 2026.\n\n\"A festival that celebrates everything writers love and everything that's really positive about Bendigo,\" he said.",

    "text": "James O'Connor has missed three crucial late kicks as the injury-hit Wallabies suffered an agonising 30-22 loss to South Africa in Cape Town.\n\nThe Wallabies entered Saturday night's (Sunday morning AEST) Rugby Championship match looking to win back-to-back Tests against the Springboks in South Africa for the first time since 1963 following last week's famous 38-22 triumph in Johannesburg.\n\nSouth Africa led 20-7 approaching half-time, but the Wallabies hit back hard after the break and closed the margin to one point in the 68th minute when reserve hooker Brandon Paenga-Amosa touched down following a successful rolling maul.\n\nO'Connor slightly slipped during his conversion attempt, pulling the kick to the near side in what proved to be a major missed opportunity.\n\nSouth Africa extended their lead 30-22 in the 75th minute, but O'Connor had a chance to close the gap back to five points three minutes later with a 25m penalty from a slight angle.\n\nO'Connor pushed that kick to the right this time, and his 50m penalty attempt in the 80th minute, which would have given Australia a losing bonus point, fell short.\n\nYet it was still another brave and encouraging performance from the Wallabies, who were again hamstrung by more injuries.\n\nTom Wright (left) was forced off the ground after just four minutes of action. (Getty Images: Grant Pitcher)\n\nA devastated Tom Wright lasted just four minutes before going off with a left knee injury, while scrumhalf Nic White was forced off in the 13th minute with concussion after his head was slammed into the turf during a slinging tackle.\n\nProp Taniela Tupou dislocated his left pinky shortly before half-time, and outside centre Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii was subbed out at the break after an apparent head knock.\n\nIt came on top of the Wallabies losing skipper Harry Wilson (knee), James Slipper (concussion) and Dylan Pietsch (broken jaw) last week.\n\n\"I'm super proud of my boys,\" stand-in Wallabies skipper Fraser McReight said.\n\n\" We lost a few good men out there, and under a bit of adversity we fought right until the end. It could have gone either way. \"\n\nSouth Africa scored two penalties inside the opening six minutes of the match before the Wallabies struck back through debutant Corey Toole in the eighth minute.\n\nWhite was the mastermind behind the try, with his quick tap-and-go and subsequent dribble kick allowing Toole to run on to the bouncing ball.\n\nSouth Africa replied soon after, with Handre Pollard's cross-kick finding an open Canan Moodie for an easy try.\n\nMcReight was denied a 13th-minute try due to an earlier knock-on, and Australia were left to rue twice turning down kickable penalties in favour of going for touch.\n\nCorey Toole took just eight minutes to score his first Wallabies try on debut. (Getty Images: Ashley Vlotman)\n\nSouth Africa's defence held firm on each occasion, and the scoreline read 20-7 when forward Kwagga Smith barged over in the 35th minute.\n\nO'Connor's penalty after the half-time siren reduced the deficit to 10 points at the break.\n\nAustralia struck first in the second half when O'Connor's chaos kick couldn't be controlled by Springboks winger Moodie, allowing Max Jorgensen to swoop on the loose ball and race over.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nA Wallabies win in Cape Town for the first time in 33 years was on the cards when Paenga-Amosa scored with 12 minutes remaining, but O'Connor's conversion miss was a huge turning point.\n\nBut there were many positives for the visitors, not least the debut of Toole, whose extreme pace and no-fear attack were a constant threat.\n\n\"I know it is a loss, but it was three tries apiece with a team that got destabilised early on. It does give belief,\" Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt said.\n\n\"I feel like we have built some belief. It is a group of players I am enjoying working with immensely. They enjoy their work and the way we are trying to play.\n\n\"I have never had so many messages of support for Australian rugby as I have seen this week.\"\n\nAAP",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Dockers ultimately lost to Port Adelaide but it remains a cautionary tale as 12th-placed St Kilda seek to play finals spoilers at Engie Stadium on Sunday, when GWS look to secure a home elimination final.\n\nNow boasting the signature of in-demand talent Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera, Lyon\u2019s side are gunning for a fifth straight win.\n\nThe Giants, one of four teams that started the final round on 60 points, can finish as high as fifth or as low as eighth, depending on how results fall.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough motivation, Giants academy product and defender Harry Himmelberg will also mark his 200-game milestone.\n\n\u201cIf we think we\u2019re going to roll in and just get a result, I think we\u2019d be kidding ourselves,\u201d Giants midfielder Green told AAP. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to play for. We won\u2019t be taking the game lightly.\u201d\n\nCurbing Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s impact on the game will be No.1 on the agenda for the Giants.\n\nThe 22-year-old has had a devastating effect on opponents since being moved from half-back into the midfield this year.\n\nDeploying Toby Bedford as a tagger is a lever GWS coach Adam Kingsley could pull, though the midfielder-forward hasn\u2019t been used recently in that role.\n\nIf it were up to Green, it wouldn\u2019t be him either.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s (Wanganeen-Milera) probably too quick for me,\u201d Green joked. \u201cHe\u2019s playing a little bit of everywhere and has a bit of a license to go and influence the game in all parts of the ground. He will be a tough prospect to stop and if we can go some way to dealing with him, I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll help us get close to a good result.\u201d\n\nGWS are unchanged for Sunday\u2019s clash after initial hopes of defender Jack Buckley (calf) playing his first game since round 20. Lethal small forward Brent Daniels, absent since round 14, will make his return from an adductor injury through the VFL.\n\nSt Kilda made one change, with last week\u2019s debutant Alex Dodson making way for Isaac Keeler.",

    "text": "There are only a handful of names that can be considered luxury Australian brands. R.M.Williams is one; Aesop paved the way for high-end handwash; and Penfolds is another. The luxury wine makes up more than a third of parent company Treasury Wine Estates\u2019 total revenue of nearly $3 billion. Patrimony wine from Daou Vineyards: is this the next Penfolds? Treasury has weathered Australia\u2019s trade war with the lucrative China market, which has been fatal for many Australian wineries, without suffering brand damage. It lifted prices, and held them, at a time when many households were struggling with cost of living pressures. While demand for luxury wine continues to grow steadily, cheaper wine has become unpopular. Treasury has been forced to keep its commercial wine brands after trying and failing to find a buyer for the right price. There\u2019s a lot riding on the success of Penfolds. Would it be prudent to have another brand in the works?\n\nIndustry watchers will know that what Treasury\u2019s $1.6 billion acquisition of Californian wine brand Daou Vineyards was about. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting; if you\u2019re in California, Daou needs no introduction and Penfolds probably does. Here in Australia, or in China obviously, it\u2019s vice versa,\u201d said Treasury chief Tim Ford. Loading How exactly do you build a brand that\u2019s considered luxury? It\u2019s all about experiences, said Ford, who said old, traditional advertising methods would not cut it any more. \u201cA brand that links to experiences, that then brings status to the consumer as they are consuming, buying, gifting that product, whatever the occasion may be, is how you build these brands,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a luxury brand playbook from around the world \u2026 We don\u2019t think we\u2019ve created it, we\u2019ve copied them from other luxury brands, but we\u2019ve done a pretty good job with Penfolds, and we plan to do a similar job at Daou.\u201d\n\nA2 Milking it Former market darling A2 Milk is best known for its infant formula, but tucked away in this $5.8 billion dual-listed company is a tiny, fast-growing part of the business: milk powder for adults and seniors. One of A2 Milk\u2019s biggest challenges is the declining birth rate in China, a market that accounts for three-quarters of the business. Meanwhile, millions of people are getting older every year, and demand is increasing for fortified and functional milk powder. A2 Milk chief David Bortolussi: The infant formula company\u2019s fastest-growing part of the business isn\u2019t infant formula. Credit: David Rowland \u201cThe number of newborns has come down over the last 20 years from 30 million to less than 10 million,\u201d said A2 Milk chief David Bortolussi. \u201cEvery year you\u2019ve got almost like 25 to 30 million seniors falling into that [60 years and above] category \u2026 Not surprisingly, their nutritional needs are not too dissimilar to younger people.\u201d\n\nA2 Milk recently introduced three new products for bone strength, gut health, and heart health that are going well, Bortolussi said. Its fortified milk business grew 23 per cent during fiscal 2025. \u201cI\u2019d want [it] to be as big as it possibly can.\u201d Subway has a new challenger You might not know Retail Food Group by name, but you\u2019ve almost certainly heard of Gloria Jean\u2019s and Donut King. The food franchisor\u2019s portfolio also encompasses pizza chain Crust, Brumby\u2019s Bakery, Beefy\u2019s pies, Firehouse Subs, Michel\u2019s patisserie, as well as CIBO Espresso and Pizza Capers. ASX food chain franchisor Retail Food Group is positioning Firehouse Subs as a superior rival to Subway. Running 1250 outlets across 30 countries is a lot to keep track of, which is why Retail Food Group has been phasing out low-performing brands (such as Michel\u2019s and CIBO) and backing brands they see growth potential in.\n\n\u201cThe best chance of accelerating growth in the next phase is around our Beefy\u2019s and Firehouse [Subs] businesses,\u201d said Retail Food Group chief Matthew Marshall. Loading Retail Food Group has aggressive store expansion plans for Beefy\u2019s Pies (50 stores by 2028) and sandwich business Firehouse Subs, with a target to open 165 stores, which Marshall is hoping will eat some of Subway\u2019s lunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a $1.7 billion category, it\u2019s growing fast, and it\u2019s really only got one big competitor in Subway,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a really, really strong case here to shake up the category and have a real go at bringing something new.\u201d As part of efforts to focus on fewer, better brands, the group is putting Brumby\u2019s Bakery up for sale. A review of the bakery chain\u2019s value resulted in a $12.2 million write-down. \u201cOur priorities have changed over the years,\u201d the company stated.\n\nDiscounting is out of fashion Two years ago, when Australians were counting their dollars more carefully after 13 interest rate rises, retail markdowns of 30 per cent to 40 per cent were common \u2013 but you won\u2019t find smart retailers doing that. Youth fashion retailer Universal Store grew total sales by 15.5 per cent despite a pretty tough retail environment, which chief executive Alice Barbery said was down to \u201cgreat range curation\u201d and \u201creally robust and beautiful\u201d offers. Universal Store chief executive Alice Barbery. Credit: Peter Wallis \u201cA lot of people might be growing with top-line sales, but they\u2019re doing it at the cost of gross margin, so it\u2019s through discounting. We\u2019ve been able to do that without \u2026 participating in the rampant discounting,\u201d she said. Tight inventory control is also key. \u201cWe\u2019ve trained our customer to pay full price. We also want to be sure that we don\u2019t end up with over-stock issues, which devalues the product.\u201d\n\nUniversal Store appears to be doing much better than its rival, General Pants Co, which has been quietly closing stores across the country and is battling its third attempt to be wound up by frustrated suppliers attempting to claw back thousands of dollars owed by the retailer. Ingham\u2019s hungry for fast food Chicken has been a winner on the dinner tables of Australians for its relative affordability compared with red meat prices, which have risen by 25 per cent for lamb and 40 per cent for beef over the past five years. Ingham\u2019s needs to win new customers. Credit: But major poultry supplier Ingham\u2019s has had a tough year; a major supply contract with Woolworths ended after the nation\u2019s grocery chain decided to diversify its pool of suppliers, leaving Ingham\u2019s to fill the gap by selling more to Coles, Aldi and IGA.\n\nIn short, Ingham\u2019s needs more customers for its chicken. It\u2019ll focus on what it can control, but is hoping for a fast-food fix. \u201cThere\u2019s some good growth prospects as it relates to the emerging and medium-sized quick-service restaurants,\u201d said new chief Edward Alexander. Loading Ingham\u2019s supplies chicken to KFC, McDonald\u2019s and Nandos. Cost of living pressures have led customers to make meals at home instead of eating out, to the detriment of Ingham\u2019s food-service sales, but Alexander is hoping to see foot traffic return to eateries. \u201c[Quick-service restaurant] operators have really gotten back, not to a point of growth, but certainly seeing some green shoots as it relates to the sales and some of their foot traffic measures,\u201d said Alexander.",

The code normally updates every three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe freeze excludes essential safety and quality changes and maintains the strong residential standards adopted in 2022, including 7-star energy efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will use the pause to streamline the code, including improving its usability with artificial intelligence, removing barriers and encouraging modern methods of construction, such as prefab and modular housing, and improving how code additions are developed.\n\n\n\nJim Chalmers confirmed alterations to the national code at last week's productivity summit. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Removing building red tape to speed up housing construction won't cut corners on standards, Housing Minister Clare O'Neil said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's too hard to build a home in this country. We want builders on site, not filling in forms to get their approval,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will also fast-track environmental assessment applications for more than 26,000 homes by creating a specialised environment department team, prioritising robust development applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also looking to use AI tools to simplify and hasten approvals.\n\n\n\n\"Piloting an AI program to help users navigate the volumes of codes and standards will add significant value, allowing more time to build homes and potentially reducing paperwork,\" Housing Industry Association director Jocelyn Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt said fast-tracked projects will still need to meet all environmental requirements, but developers will be incentivised to provide required information up front.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This approach will ensure strong national environmental protections, while also leading to faster decision making, more certainty for industry and more homes for Australians,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving impediments for superannuation investment in new housing and working with the states and territories to accelerate planning, zoning and approvals are also slated under the changes.\n\n\n\n\"We want builders on site, not filling in forms to get their approval,\" Housing Minister Clare O'Neil said.

    "text": "In schoolyards and dance clubs across the country, Australians are embracing a genre-bending animated film centred around a K-pop girl band that secretly fights demons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Netflix original KPop Demon Hunters has become an unlikely worldwide phenomenon, including in Australia, and is now the second most popular English-language movie globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the nine weeks since its premiere on 21 June, it has racked up 210 million views and is second only to action comedy film Red Notice on the screener's list of most popular movies. It's the first animated movie to enter the list.\n\n\n\nThe animated film KPop Demon Hunters follows a girl band called Huntr/x. Source: Supplied / Netflix In Australia, KPop Demon Hunters is currently the number one film on Netflix and has spent nine weeks in the top 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's become so popular that singalong screenings are being held in Hoyts cinemas across the country this weekend.\n\n\n\nWhat is KPop Demon Hunters about?\n\nThe English-language animated musical is a vibrant introduction to the world of K-pop and follows the lives of girl group Huntr/x, whose soaring vocals help keep demons away.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe music drives much of the film's appeal, and the soundtrack has been the number one album on the ARIA charts in Australia for five non-consecutive weeks. The song Golden has also topped the Top 50 Singles, securing a rare ARIA chart double.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected and co-written by Maggie Kang, who was born in South Korea and grew up in Canada, the film was inspired by Kang's love of K-pop.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australians are getting hooked on Korean TV\n\n\"I have been a fan of these incredible artists and their work for many years, so it's a dream come true to have original songs written and produced for our film by legendary talent such as The Black Label [a leading South Korean record label],\" Kang says.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sung-Ae Lee, an expert in Asian cinema at Macquarie University, describes the film's blend of fast-paced visuals as channelling \"global energy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe points to its incorporation of K-pop culture, which thrives online, and says it reflects young people's use of social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube, as well as its fan communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's kind of a turning point ... it's a really innovative idea of K-pop idols plus this fantasy genre,\" she says.\n\n\n\nKPop Demon Hunters follows the lives of K-pop superstars Rumi, Mira and Zoey, who use their secret identities as demon hunters to protect their fans from a supernatural threat. Source: Supplied / Netflix While Lee believes the success of the music, which is performed by real singers, is connected to its narrative context within the film, others have suggested it also demonstrates the potential for animated bands, possibly driven by artificial intelligence , to achieve chart success.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuk-Young Kim, a professor at the University of California, told the Wall Street Journal the film's success shows it's possible for fans to connect with nonhuman idols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a long-running dream for K-pop companies,\" Kim said. \"Here we have idols who never sleep, never get sick, never age.\"\n\n\n\nSchoolkids embrace hit film\n\nThe popularity of the film appears to have grown organically without the publicity that has helped fuel the success of other Netflix hits such as Red Notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney mother Alison McLeod says she watched KPop Demon Hunters with her seven-year-old daughter after it was recommended by the Netflix algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 44-year-old says the film reminded her of the Japanese manga series Astro Boy and other animations she watched as a child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had friends that were into manga and definitely into K-pop music ... I knew a little bit about the genre and what to expect. And it just looked fun,\" McLeod tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nWhat I really liked once we started watching it was the themes ... the girl power.\n\n\"It embraces the [non] typical girl \u2014 these three girls are different. They just presented as really good role models for my little one, she's fiesty.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer daughter now re-enacts scenes from the movie with her friends at school, and McLeod says she also attended a seven-year-old's birthday party recently that featured songs from the soundtrack during a game of musical bumps (like musical statues but players sit instead of freeze).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were rocking out to the Demon Hunter soundtrack and every single kid there knew all the words,\" she says.\n\n\n\nMcLeod says her daughter is predominantly attracted to the music, with the film's soundtrack now on daily rotation in their car and home. But she also seems to identify more with the characters than those in other films, such as Encanto and Trolls, which have been previous obsessions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcLeod has previously dyed her hair purple and both she and her partner have tattoos \u2014 like the lead character in Demon Hunters, Rumi. She says the film is helping her daughter to embrace differences in personal style and expression as \"cool\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not the norm in society, and I think that she [McLeod's daughter] feels like the Huntr/x girls embody that in a really cool way ... she'll [now] be like 'I can have purple hair'.\"\n\n\n\nA Hollywood film featuring Korean culture\n\nThe film has also been a hit within the Korean community and remains the top movie on Netflix in South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I thought maybe Korean audiences [would] resist it but it was really popular and they like it,\" Lee says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's because it's youth culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee says she didn't like KPop Demon Hunters the first time she watched it because it seemed Americanised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[While] the subject is quite Korean ... it's not Korean at all, it's actually Hollywood.\n\n\n\nThe animation is American to me \u2014 the body language and facial expression \u2014 they're all American, not Korean.\n\nShe says it's hard to pinpoint exact movements, but one example is shrugging, a common gesture in the US, and quite different to gestural conventions in Korean films.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in other ways, it incorporates culturally Korean tropes, and folklore elements that Lee found impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film features a tiger and a magpie, a combination that is often seen in Korean folk paintings called Jakhodo. They symbolise good fortune and are thought to ward off evil spirits.\n\n\n\nA scene featuring a large tiger and magpie talking to the lead character Rumi. Source: Supplied / Netflix \"I was really surprised in the beginning [that] they're using it. I think it's one of the most beloved folk images [in Korean culture],\" Lee says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the boy band in the film, Saja, also has a dual meaning in Korean.

He says now that so many people are already experiencing famine, regular food is not enough to save them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So when somebody is malnourished, how can they recover? Well, the answer is fairly simple. It's being provided therapeutic food. Therapeutic food is food that is completely replete with all the nutrients that are needed in ample quantities. If you had enough food in Gaza today for everyone to eat as much as they wanted, it would be three months before everyone would be recovered. But a week's worth of therapeutic food is life-saving.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael controls the flow of aid into Gaza and has dismissed the findings as biased.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers in the childcare sector say staffing issues remain unaddressed, after Friday's meeting on childcare safety attended by state and territory ministers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ministers have agreed to establish a national register of childcare workers to be trialled and launched in early 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will also be a CCTV trial that will run at 300 centres across the country from October or November.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreeti Soodan, from the United Workers Union, says there needs to be change to ensure adequate staffing numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we talk about the under roof ratio, it is extremely important to have minimum staff, as per that licensing of the childcare centre because it leads to... It is important that it should meet the Australian quality framework. And we are just demanding for the bare minimum, which is essential for the safety and wellbeing of the children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Gurindji community in the Northern Territory are marking 50 years since the Gurindji land handback, a historic turning point for Aboriginal land rights in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter an almost decade-long struggle, in 1975 then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam poured sand into the hands of Gurindji man Vincent Lingiari - granting his people a lease to a parcel of land on the Wave Hill cattle station.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe moment paved the way for the Aboriginal Land Rights Movement \u2013 and the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Rights Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time Indigenous Australians could claim land rights if they could prove traditional ownership.\n\n\n\n\n\nGurindji Elder George Edwards says the community has come together this weekend - for the annual Gurindji Freedom Day Festival - to mark the significance of that moment, and the leadership shown by Vincent Lingiari then and the historic Wave Hill Walk-off a decade earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was a great leader. He was the leader of the tribe, all tribe... Mr Lingiari, he was a great man. He was a hero for me.

    "text": "People seeking a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine may have noticed that there is only one option available: Pfizer Comirnaty JN.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Department of Health, Pfizer has been the only vaccine brand administered to Australians since the start of the year .\n\n\n\n\n\nWith two COVID-19 variants circulating across the country, and only 1.9 million Australians having received a vaccine in the past six months, experts say choice is important when it comes to encouraging Australians to get the jab.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why is there only one vaccine currently available?\n\n\n\nPfizer's Comirnaty JN.1 vaccine is the dominant vaccine brand in Australia. Source: AAP / Jenny Kane\n\nWhat happened to the other vaccines?\n\nThe main mRNA alternative to Pfizer is Moderna. Both companies have produced vaccines targeting the Omicron variant JN.1, which was dominant across Australia for much of 2023 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nModerna's JN.1 vaccine was approved for use in Australia in late 2024 by the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA), the body responsible for approving medical products in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, despite approval, in 2024 the Australian government decided not to replenish its supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commonwealth has sufficient supplies of alternative COVID-19 vaccine brands for 2024,\" a Department of Health spokesperson told SBS News at the time .\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could change next year, however, as a newly built Moderna Technology Centre at Monash University in Melbourne is aiming to locally produce 100 million vaccines per year for COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. It is expected to start production in late 2025.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why a popular COVID-19 vaccine has been withdrawn worldwide\n\nAnother mRNA vaccine, AstraZeneca, was recalled globally in 2024 after the company admitted it could cause adverse side effects.\n\n\n\nWhy isn't Novavax available?\n\nOne mRNA alternative also not on our shelves is Novavax.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Novavax was one of the first batches of vaccines to bought by Australia. Its original COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, was available for Australians from early 2022 .\n\n\n\n\n\nIts updated vaccine, Nuvaxovid XBB.1.5, did not receive TGA approval in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't that approval was revoked with any specific safety or efficacy concerns. It was just that the amount of data required for that approval to be met just wasn't achieved,\" Dr Paul Griffin, infectious diseases physician and clinical microbiologist at Brisbane's Mater Health Services, said.\n\n\n\nNovavax withdrew its updated vaccine for TGA approval in 2024 but says it is committed to making its vaccine available to Australians. Source: AAP / Matthias Bein Novavax told SBS News it is committed to making the vaccine available to Australians and are working with the TGA to determine the best path forward. However, according to the TGA, Novavax withdrew its registration on 21 May 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Adrian Esterman, chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, said that low uptake in Australia may have been a factor in the company deciding not to renew its registration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not so much that the vaccine doesn't work, but it's simply not commercially viable for them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since then, they've developed a JN.1 vaccine which has been approved in several other countries, but they haven't bothered with Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEsterman said this is not good news for people who relied on Novavax as an alternative to mRNA offerings.\n\n\n\nWhy do some people prefer Novavax?\n\nNovavax is a protein subunit vaccine. Esterman said it's made by taking the genetic material of the virus, the DNA, and putting it into the cells of a moth. This makes the moth produce spike proteins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They then add to that what they call an adjuvant, which is a substance they get from a soapbark tree, and that helps the body react to these spikes ... and that's what they inject in you,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn mRNA vaccine, by contrast, tells your body to make the spike proteins. Griffin said Novavax is preferred by some people who have had reactions to mRNA vaccines in the past.\n\n\n\n\"There are a whole host of people who have had reactions to mRNA vaccines, things like myocarditis, for example, and it's thought that perhaps that's a lower risk with Novavax. Or people who just don't like the thought of a vaccine based on the mRNA technology.\"\n\n\n\nWhy choice matters\n\nEsterman explained that having a variety of vaccine options is about making sure you have the right tools for the job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's best to have several tools in your tool case. You wouldn't have one type of hammer; what if it doesn't work? You need something different. So it's good to have a variety of vaccines, and most countries do that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can also impact overall vaccination uptake, which both Griffin and Esterman say is currently low among vulnerable populations.\n\n\n\nExperts say the perception of choice when it comes to vaccine brands can help stimulate vaccine uptake among vulnerable populations. Source: AAP / Joan Mateu July figures from the Department of Health indicate that only 35 per cent of Australians aged 75 and over received a vaccination in the last six months, dropping to 22 per cent for those aged 65 to 74. Only 3 per cent of people between 18 and 64 received a vaccine this year. While these figures are slightly higher than previous months, overall rates of vaccination are lower than experts would like .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's certainly a lot of people that aren't opposed to being vaccinated who just don't want, or can't have, an mRNA vaccine, and so are likely to remain unvaccinated, which is a huge issue,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we could get a proportion of those people to be boosted, it would certainly be beneficial. So I'd really like to see there be an option for an alternative.\"\n\n\n\nAre we still catching COVID-19?\n\nIn short: yes.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two COVID-19 waves each year: summer and winter. A recent winter peak is subsiding after an outbreak across more than 200 aged facilities.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Has COVID changed in five years? What to know as winter looms\n\nThe current dominant strain in Australia is NB.1.8.1 or the Nimbus variant. Another variant, XFG or Stratus, is growing in dominance overseas, with high rates of infection in India, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffin warned that there are still risks between the waves, and it is important not to be complacent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Between those waves we see significant numbers of cases, and still see people in hospital from COVID-19...and that's why we really need to keep the highest risk people regularly vaccinated to keep them protected.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian government recommends those in high-risk groups, such as the over-75s, aged care residents, or the immunocompromised, receive a booster shot every six months. For lower-risk groups, a booster shot every 12 months should suffice.\n\n\n\n",

Because I'm going to go one way or the other, and they'll learn which way I'm going. And it's going to be a very important decision.

The trial I think is a very good step in the right direction. I accept that there are going to be privacy concerns, and we know for a fact that, sadly, those who prey on our most vulnerable, on children, have utilised CCTV and other systems to their own ends, which is something we need to guard against.

SBS News has contacted the AFL for comment on what those medical submissions were.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rankine rang the Collingwood player to personally apologise and he fully cooperated with the subsequent investigation by the AFL Integrity Unit including by admitting the use of the homophobic slur and being remorseful for it,\" the AFL said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAFL general counsel Stephen Meade said: \"The language used was offensive, hurtful and highly inappropriate. Our players have a very clear understanding of what is acceptable on the football field. Importantly, in this instance it was called out by players and acknowledged by Izak himself as wrong \u2014 and that reflects the standards we expect and demand in our game.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAFL CEO Andrew Dillon said \"inclusion and respect are key priorities for the AFL\" and acknowleged that there was \"much more work to do\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know people in the LGBTQI+ community are hurting when an incident like this happens,\" Dillon said on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Adelaide captain Jordan Dawson denied the incident was a sign of a wider cultural issue in the AFL.\n\n\n\nDr Robert Boucaut, a lecturer in media at the University of Adelaide, however, said the incident was a \"symptom of a broader problem\" and wasn't just an isolated incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In team sports, you are often prioritising and valuing traits around hyper-masculinity and aggression \u2014 and looking towards methods to undermine opposing teams on those levels,\" Boucaut told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Homophobia, misogyny, queerphobia and transphobia all plays into that culture of sledging in the game,\" he said. \"The language used on-field and, more than likely behind the scenes, is one of exclusion, one of ostracisation, and othering.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it \"threatens the safety and viability of diverse communities being able to participate in sport\".\n\n\n\nRankine is the sixth AFL-listed player banned for a homophobic slur against an opponent in the past 16 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoucaut says there has been an uptick in reporting these incidents since 2023, which may indicate a slight cultural shift. But he says the way these incidents are tackled still \"misses the bigger picture of a culture of institutional homophobia\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The AFL is unique amongst the world\u2019s elite sporting codes in never having had an openly gay male player \u2014 that itself supports this picture of the AFL being an unsafe and unsupportive environment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDarce says the incident sends the message that Aussie rules is not a safe place for queer people like them: \"It's very clearly saying that we're not safe playing footy and that we\u2019re not welcome.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The AFL tried to brush it off as a single incident, not that it's a cultural issue.\"\n\n\n\nThe 'tip of the iceberg'\n\nDr Ryan Storr from the Sport Innovation Research Group at Swinburne University of Technology is a co-author of the Free to Exist research paper, published last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found that 53 per cent of young LGBTQIA+ people have witnessed discrimination, and 40 per cent have experienced discrimination \u2014 mostly through verbal vilification.\n\n\n\n\n\nStorr says gay men were the largest group to report discrimination, with 76 per cent hearing or witnessing homophobia.\n\n\n\nHe's not surprised by Darce's experience. \"In the last couple of years, in particular with the rise of right-wing conservatism, the Trump effect, and what we've seen in the UK in changing the definition of a woman, there's been an increase in anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, trans and gender diverse people have been copping this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is just the top of the iceberg.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the environment has led to an increase in body policing \u2014 something that Darce has experienced: \"In men\u2019s sports and the men\u2019s football, anything that\u2019s seen as feminine \u2014 whether it be having longer hair or painting your nails \u2014 there's this assumption of your sexuality that this person might be gay and that\u2019s somehow not masculine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the women\u2019s comp, it\u2019s less homophobia you face and it\u2019s more transphobia you get,\" they said. \"If your hair is too short or you\u2019re too tall or your voice is a bit deep, there\u2019s this assumption that, 'oh, you mustn\u2019t be a girl then'.\"\n\n\n\nBut Storr is cautious to place the blame entirely on politics, saying the AFL needs to take ownership of the culture it has created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sport is a reflection of society, but I think sometimes it can be heightened,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the Izak Rankine case, if you had said this in a work setting, you're not getting a slap on the wrist \u2014 you'd be fired. Sport seems to be immune to this.\"\n\n\n\nFlow on for community sports\n\nBut instances like Rankine's don't just take place at Adelaide Oval. It can also have devastating flow-on effects in community spaces and online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every time an incident like this happens, you get maybe four or five days afterwards of just online commentary \u2014 and it's often quite negative,\" Storr said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, what you have is overt homophobia in online environments \u2026 it sends the message that LGBTQIA+ people aren't welcome in sport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHis research has also led to him speaking to local clubs, with one club manager explaining that incidents like these can lead to a rise in homophobic language on the field.\n\n\n\nAFL CEO Andrew Dillon said \"inclusion and respect are key priorities for the AFL\", adding that \"people in the LGBTQI+ community are hurting when an incident like this happens\". Source: AAP / Joel Carrett \"The large percentage of community clubs and sport volunteers have mentioned that homophobic language is very prevalent and a problem. One club said that the last time this happened, discussion of and use of homophobic language increased,\" Storr says.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoucaut adds that larger cultural attitudes in the AFL can trickle down into local, community, and junior leagues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The flow-on effects to communities would be disheartening,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"If the elite spaces of AFL aren\u2019t leading the charge, it puts community clubs in a stymied position, because it gives a pass for those behaviours to trickle down \u2014 to be seen as just part of the game.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Storr, that's particularly worrying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When they hear their role models say it, it gives these young boys ammunition to do that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The main perpetrators of homophobia are young teenage boys in groups \u2014 that's why sport is rife for this and it's an area that promotes it, unfortunately.\"\n\n\n\n'We're not problems to be fixed'\n\nAs for what that change might look like, it's difficult to envision.\n\n\n\n\n\nStorr advocates for a \"multi-pronged\" approach, including education, to get to the core of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A band-aid solution of giving a ban is not working,\" he said. \"Culture change and attitudinal change takes a long time, but they need to realise this is a problem and have a carefully curated plan and strategy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoucaut says systemic homophobia and queerphobia can't simply be fixed through match bans, sanctions, or pride education.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, he urges to shift the conversation away from punishment and look at more holistic efforts to enhance queer representation in the league, especially in the commentary space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is space for the sport and the code to change. The game has made many adaptations over its existence \u2014 this can be another adaptation they choose to make,\" Boucaut said.\n\n\n\nBut for Darce, dreams are as simple as wanting to kick a footy safely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Queer people are treated as an outside problem to be solved or worked out or tolerated, rather than people who are part of the sport and have every right to simply be included and belong without our existence being questioned,\" Darce said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The queer community has had such immeasurably positive impacts for the good of Australian sports and society \u2014 it's insulting that the conversation seems to be around treating queer people like they're the problem, when they are the ones that should be receiving the most support right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone should be comfortable playing sports. We're not problems to be fixed.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "In 2014, Aunty Donna's promising comedy career was on a knife-edge.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter being nominated for the prestigious Golden Gibbo award for their first live show, the then-four-person sketch comedy crew were down a member and questioning whether they could work as a trio.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add salt to the wound, the venue they'd been put in for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival was on the fringes of the CBD, far away from all the action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was an impasse where it's like: this is either going to fall apart or gain momentum,\" Broden Kelly says of how he and the other two performing members of the group were feeling at the time.\n\n\n\nIn the early years of their comedy career, Aunty Donna performed as a quartet. Credit: Isabelle Clara Mason After \"white-knuckling it\" to create a show they were really proud of, SBS Comedy gave them a less-than-favourable review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They hated it,\" Mark Samual Bonanno recalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had a sit-down on Lygon Street and we went around a circle and said something we like about each other \u2014 that's how much it affected us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile that two-star review knocked their confidence, Zachary Ruane credits it with being \"a very important step in our journey\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The funny side of grief: What the fear of dying young taught Michelle Brasier about life\n\n\"The big lesson that we got out of it was that we might work really hard to get on that stage and to make a good thing, but when people come and watch us, they've just worked hard at probably something that matters a lot more than what we do,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They don't come to us to see us working hard; they come to us to forget about the hard work they've just done, to forget about their struggles \u2026 so we need to just get up there and have fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That kind of conversation and that realisation, I think, informed so much of what we do.\"\n\n\n\nFinding non-traditional pathways to success\n\nA decade on, and Aunty Donna \u2014 made up of writers and performers Bonanno, Kelly, and Ruane, along with head writer and stage director Sam Lingham, director Max Miller, and composer Thomas Zahariou \u2014 have toured all over the world, created two TV shows, released a studio album, worked with the likes of Shaun Micalleff, Tony Martin and Weird Al Yankovic, and published a colouring book.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of that success is thanks to the loyal following they built online through their YouTube channel, which boasts more than 639,000 subscribers, their self-titled podcast and their Patreon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we were starting, there were three or four people at festivals and networks that had to like what you did, and if they didn't like what you did, then good luck to you,\" Ruane says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were kind of the first generation that were then able to go: 'Well, you don't like us, but we'll go find an audience'.\"\n\n\n\nWith 2018's Always Room for Christmas Pud, a largely improvised sketch that is perhaps Aunty Donna's most well-known, they had their first taste of something approaching virality.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original upload has amassed over 4.3 million views on YouTube and Pud has also become a running gag and annual cultural celebration amongst their fans, spawning a pannettone version (a nod to Bonanno's Italian heritage), a family-friendly version, a picture book, and a mockumentary about the making of the sketch.\n\n\n\nWhile the group's vast body of work is varied in its themes and tone, their brilliance lies in their ability to take a universal experience \u2014 like dealing with horrible real estate agents, forgetting to take your reusable bags to the shops, trying to have a picnic as an adult, and offloading cake at the end of a party \u2014 and add an absurdist and oftentimes dark edge to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Aunty Donna generally steers clear of is being overtly political.\n\n\n\nBut Kelly rejects the idea that they're \"never saying anything\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I really struggle with that because I think everything that we are doing is really saying something really simple, and that is that 'If you're a man, it's okay to look silly or to be stupid. It's okay to be weird',\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The world I lean into now with footy [Kelly hosts an AFL podcast] as well, there's so much negativity and putting down and just sort of tropes that are masculine, and just trying to reaffirm by setting the example that it doesn't have to be that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do that a lot with our stuff \u2014 but I think if things are too didactic or too instructional, you do lose a lot of people, when you could be getting them.\"\n\n\n\nGiven how many Australian references are littered throughout Aunty Donna's work (everything from Hey, Hey, it's Saturday to Eagle Boys Pizza), it's perhaps surprising that global streaming giant Netflix was willing to give them their own show before any local TV networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAunty Donna's Big Ol' House of Fun, which was co-produced by Office star Ed Helms' company Pacific Electric Picture Company, was also the only time they were given free rein to make the show they wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every other time, it was very heavily: 'You can't just do what you want to do. It has to be this, it has to tick all these boxes,' Bonanno says.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly adds: \"Often we've seen in places we've made shows before that the shows they make need to be for everyone at one time, and there's an argument that's not the best representation of diversity \u2026 maybe it's giving chances to diverse people to represent what they want to represent, as opposed to putting a square peg in a round hole.\"\n\n\n\nAunty Donna's Coffee Caf\u00e9, the TV series they produced for the ABC, featured a long list of guest start including Rake star Richard Roxburgh (centre) and Matt Doran (second from left), who played Mouse in The Matrix. Source: Supplied / ABC Asked if they felt they needed to make it overseas to be taken seriously back home, Aunty Donna doesn't pull any punches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's almost like we don't need to answer that question; the world answered the question for us,\" Ruane says.\n\n\n\n\n\nBonanno adds: \"That is Australia. That's music, that's TV, that's comedy, that's all the arts in Australia is. We don't tend to lift people up until overseas says 'This is great'.\"\n\n\n\nBuilding a 'mini Netflix for Australian comedy'\n\nThe risk-averse nature of the local screen industry has prompted Aunty Donna to invest their own money in nurturing talent that doesn't necessarily fit a mainstream mould, through their production company Haven't You Done Well and comedy network Grouse House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We kind of entrepreneurially just saw that there was a hole in the market and that every network in the country was not doing their job in platforming really good people,\" Kelly says.\n\n\n\n\"We just thought: 'Let's see if we can build something that can eventually compete,' so we've hired a whole team around us who are building this platform and building out shows and rollouts, and it's really fun to watch.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile they're starting small by funding comedians they've worked with in the past, including Demi Lardner and Greg Larsen, they hope in the long-term that Grouse House can become a \"mini Netflix for Australian comedy\".\n\n\n\n\"We see these people that are really, really good \u2026 they just need that opportunity,\" Ruane says of their desire to help other Australian comedians create sustainable careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As we grow that community out and fold more people in, hopefully, eventually we get to a place where [people say] 'Well, if Grouse House is doing it, then it's good'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The goal would be that there are fans of Grouse House in five years' time that have never heard of Aunty Donna, they just love that brand.\"\n\n\n\nThe end of an era\n\nNever ones to rest on their laurels, Aunty Donna are back out on the road with DREM, their first live show in two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show promises to be as silly and energy-filled as audiences have come to expect from the group, while also offering something new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would argue that DREM is our freest show when it comes to the ideas that are in it and how we've kind of put the show together. Production-wise, I'm the most excited about [it] because we are doing stuff that we have never done before,\" Bonanno says.\n\n\n\nAunty Donna's live shows are known for being a high octane, assault on the senses \u2014 in the best kind of way. Source: Getty / Roberto Ricciuti It's also the first time in their career that they don't have any plans about when they'll tour again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're kind of okay with the idea we won't be touring after this for a little bit because, for me at least, it feels like a real bookmark of this era where we learned all these lessons about how to make audiences laugh,\" Kelly says.\n\n\n\n\n\nRuane adds: \"It's nice to just have a bit of ambiguity there. We haven't had that for a long time.\"\n\n\n\n",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Dockers ultimately lost to Port Adelaide but it remains a cautionary tale as 12th-placed St Kilda seek to play finals spoilers at Engie Stadium on Sunday, when GWS look to secure a home elimination final.\n\nNow boasting the signature of in-demand talent Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera, Lyon\u2019s side are gunning for a fifth straight win.\n\nThe Giants, one of four teams that started the final round on 60 points, can finish as high as fifth or as low as eighth, depending on how results fall.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough motivation, Giants academy product and defender Harry Himmelberg will also mark his 200-game milestone.\n\n\u201cIf we think we\u2019re going to roll in and just get a result, I think we\u2019d be kidding ourselves,\u201d Giants midfielder Green told AAP. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to play for. We won\u2019t be taking the game lightly.\u201d\n\nCurbing Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s impact on the game will be No.1 on the agenda for the Giants.\n\nThe 22-year-old has had a devastating effect on opponents since being moved from half-back into the midfield this year.\n\nDeploying Toby Bedford as a tagger is a lever GWS coach Adam Kingsley could pull, though the midfielder-forward hasn\u2019t been used recently in that role.\n\nIf it were up to Green, it wouldn\u2019t be him either.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s (Wanganeen-Milera) probably too quick for me,\u201d Green joked. \u201cHe\u2019s playing a little bit of everywhere and has a bit of a license to go and influence the game in all parts of the ground. He will be a tough prospect to stop and if we can go some way to dealing with him, I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll help us get close to a good result.\u201d\n\nGWS are unchanged for Sunday\u2019s clash after initial hopes of defender Jack Buckley (calf) playing his first game since round 20.

    "text": "There are only a handful of names that can be considered luxury Australian brands. R.M.Williams is one; Aesop paved the way for high-end handwash; and Penfolds is another. The luxury wine makes up more than a third of parent company Treasury Wine Estates\u2019 total revenue of nearly $3 billion. Patrimony wine from Daou Vineyards: is this the next Penfolds? Treasury has weathered Australia\u2019s trade war with the lucrative China market, which has been fatal for many Australian wineries, without suffering brand damage. It lifted prices, and held them, at a time when many households were struggling with cost of living pressures. While demand for luxury wine continues to grow steadily, cheaper wine has become unpopular. Treasury has been forced to keep its commercial wine brands after trying and failing to find a buyer for the right price. There\u2019s a lot riding on the success of Penfolds. Would it be prudent to have another brand in the works?\n\nIndustry watchers will know that what Treasury\u2019s $1.6 billion acquisition of Californian wine brand Daou Vineyards was about. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting; if you\u2019re in California, Daou needs no introduction and Penfolds probably does. Here in Australia, or in China obviously, it\u2019s vice versa,\u201d said Treasury chief Tim Ford. Loading How exactly do you build a brand that\u2019s considered luxury? It\u2019s all about experiences, said Ford, who said old, traditional advertising methods would not cut it any more. \u201cA brand that links to experiences, that then brings status to the consumer as they are consuming, buying, gifting that product, whatever the occasion may be, is how you build these brands,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a luxury brand playbook from around the world \u2026 We don\u2019t think we\u2019ve created it, we\u2019ve copied them from other luxury brands, but we\u2019ve done a pretty good job with Penfolds, and we plan to do a similar job at Daou.\u201d\n\nA2 Milking it Former market darling A2 Milk is best known for its infant formula, but tucked away in this $5.8 billion dual-listed company is a tiny, fast-growing part of the business: milk powder for adults and seniors. One of A2 Milk\u2019s biggest challenges is the declining birth rate in China, a market that accounts for three-quarters of the business. Meanwhile, millions of people are getting older every year, and demand is increasing for fortified and functional milk powder. A2 Milk chief David Bortolussi: The infant formula company\u2019s fastest-growing part of the business isn\u2019t infant formula. Credit: David Rowland \u201cThe number of newborns has come down over the last 20 years from 30 million to less than 10 million,\u201d said A2 Milk chief David Bortolussi. \u201cEvery year you\u2019ve got almost like 25 to 30 million seniors falling into that [60 years and above] category \u2026 Not surprisingly, their nutritional needs are not too dissimilar to younger people.\u201d\n\nA2 Milk recently introduced three new products for bone strength, gut health, and heart health that are going well, Bortolussi said. Its fortified milk business grew 23 per cent during fiscal 2025. \u201cI\u2019d want [it] to be as big as it possibly can.\u201d Subway has a new challenger You might not know Retail Food Group by name, but you\u2019ve almost certainly heard of Gloria Jean\u2019s and Donut King. The food franchisor\u2019s portfolio also encompasses pizza chain Crust, Brumby\u2019s Bakery, Beefy\u2019s pies, Firehouse Subs, Michel\u2019s patisserie, as well as CIBO Espresso and Pizza Capers. ASX food chain franchisor Retail Food Group is positioning Firehouse Subs as a superior rival to Subway. Running 1250 outlets across 30 countries is a lot to keep track of, which is why Retail Food Group has been phasing out low-performing brands (such as Michel\u2019s and CIBO) and backing brands they see growth potential in.\n\n\u201cThe best chance of accelerating growth in the next phase is around our Beefy\u2019s and Firehouse [Subs] businesses,\u201d said Retail Food Group chief Matthew Marshall. Loading Retail Food Group has aggressive store expansion plans for Beefy\u2019s Pies (50 stores by 2028) and sandwich business Firehouse Subs, with a target to open 165 stores, which Marshall is hoping will eat some of Subway\u2019s lunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a $1.7 billion category, it\u2019s growing fast, and it\u2019s really only got one big competitor in Subway,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a really, really strong case here to shake up the category and have a real go at bringing something new.\u201d As part of efforts to focus on fewer, better brands, the group is putting Brumby\u2019s Bakery up for sale. A review of the bakery chain\u2019s value resulted in a $12.2 million write-down. \u201cOur priorities have changed over the years,\u201d the company stated.\n\nDiscounting is out of fashion Two years ago, when Australians were counting their dollars more carefully after 13 interest rate rises, retail markdowns of 30 per cent to 40 per cent were common \u2013 but you won\u2019t find smart retailers doing that. Youth fashion retailer Universal Store grew total sales by 15.5 per cent despite a pretty tough retail environment, which chief executive Alice Barbery said was down to \u201cgreat range curation\u201d and \u201creally robust and beautiful\u201d offers. Universal Store chief executive Alice Barbery. Credit: Peter Wallis \u201cA lot of people might be growing with top-line sales, but they\u2019re doing it at the cost of gross margin, so it\u2019s through discounting. We\u2019ve been able to do that without \u2026 participating in the rampant discounting,\u201d she said. Tight inventory control is also key. \u201cWe\u2019ve trained our customer to pay full price. We also want to be sure that we don\u2019t end up with over-stock issues, which devalues the product.\u201d\n\nUniversal Store appears to be doing much better than its rival, General Pants Co, which has been quietly closing stores across the country and is battling its third attempt to be wound up by frustrated suppliers attempting to claw back thousands of dollars owed by the retailer. Ingham\u2019s hungry for fast food Chicken has been a winner on the dinner tables of Australians for its relative affordability compared with red meat prices, which have risen by 25 per cent for lamb and 40 per cent for beef over the past five years. Ingham\u2019s needs to win new customers. Credit: But major poultry supplier Ingham\u2019s has had a tough year; a major supply contract with Woolworths ended after the nation\u2019s grocery chain decided to diversify its pool of suppliers, leaving Ingham\u2019s to fill the gap by selling more to Coles, Aldi and IGA.\n\nIn short, Ingham\u2019s needs more customers for its chicken. It\u2019ll focus on what it can control, but is hoping for a fast-food fix. \u201cThere\u2019s some good growth prospects as it relates to the emerging and medium-sized quick-service restaurants,\u201d said new chief Edward Alexander. Loading Ingham\u2019s supplies chicken to KFC, McDonald\u2019s and Nandos. Cost of living pressures have led customers to make meals at home instead of eating out, to the detriment of Ingham\u2019s food-service sales, but Alexander is hoping to see foot traffic return to eateries. \u201c[Quick-service restaurant] operators have really gotten back, not to a point of growth, but certainly seeing some green shoots as it relates to the sales and some of their foot traffic measures,\u201d said Alexander.",

    "text": "With EV driver set to face a road user tax in the coming years, Jim Chalmers has said the levy will not operate as a \u201cdouble tax\u201d on petrol cars. Picture: NewsWire/Tertius Pickard\n\nJim Chalmers has clarified the pending road user charge will only be applied to electric vehicle drivers and will not be used as a way to \u201cdouble tax\u201d motorists who use petrol vehicles.\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s three-day roundtable, the Treasurer said there was broad consensus for a tax which would result in EV drivers being slugged with a tax, to make up for revenue lost through the fuel excise for petrol vehicles, currently calculated at 51.6 cents a litre.\n\nThe money is used to pay for road maintenance and upgrades, with the fee is automatically calculated into the cost of petrol when filling us at the bowser.\n\nFurther talks, including the presentation of an options paper, will occur at a joint state and federal treasurers\u2019 meeting on September 5, following consultation with states and Infrastructure Minister Catherine King.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Sunday Mr Chalmers clarified the road user charge would only be applied to EV drivers and said it would not a \u201cdouble tax on internal combustion engines\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur focus in road user charging is on electric vehicles,\u201d he confirmed.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to make sure that people who drive EVs, increasing numbers of people who drive electric vehicles are making a contribution to the upkeep of the roads that they use.\u201d\n\nThe Commonwealth government is progressing negotiations on a road user charge for EV vehicles. Picture: NewsWire/ Tertius Pickard\n\nMr Chalmers added that members at the roundtable flagged questions on whether the rollout of a charge would be staggered or include light vehicles (i.e. cars) from the outset.\n\n\u201cThe main point of contention at the reform roundtable was actually whether a road user charging regime focused on electric vehicles begins with heavy electric vehicles like electric trucks and there is some kind of sequence after that, or whether we be more ambitious earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to predetermine the discussions I\u2019ve had with the states and considerations with our government \u2026 but we have made it clear that we do think a change is required here and we will take the time to get it right.\u201d\n\nNSW is the only state which has flagged a road user charging system to hit EVs either by July 2027 or when EVs make up 30 per cent of all new vehicle sales.\n\nJim Chalmers has said it will not be a \u2018double tax\u2019 on petrol cars. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nVictoria attempted to bring in a similar proposal \u2013 calculated about 2 cents a kilometre \u2013 in 2022.\n\nBut the High Court ruled it as unconstitutional in 2023 and said the excise tax should be in the realm of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Coalition has also indicated support for a levy on EV drivers, saying it will consider the merits of the policy once more details are released.\n\n\u201cEverybody agrees that it is not fair that some road users who fill up their car with petrol and diesel pay the costs of maintaining roads, and some road uses who have an EV don\u2019t contribute to that cost, and so that is an issue which needs to be recognised,\u201d Coalition finance spokesman James Paterson said on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe want to see the details here, and it will involve co-operation with the states. It sounds like it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to come very quickly, but we\u2019ll consider on its merits any proposal that the government brings forward.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/brandon_69x5/",

    "text": "Retirees still deserve concessional treatment on their superannuation, the treasurer says, despite mounting calls for an overhaul of the tax system.\n\nJim Chalmers said fairness for younger generations needed to be considered as part of any change to taxes, following talks at the three-day productivity roundtable in Canberra.\n\nWhile he said calls for tax reform at the summit would inform upcoming federal budgets, he said there was no plan to alter concessional tax measures for retirees on their super balances.\n\n\"They still deserve concessional treatment to encourage people to be in superannuation, and that's not something that we have been proposing to change,\" Dr Chalmers told ABC's Insiders program on Sunday.\n\nIntergenerational fairness would be central to any reform of the tax system, Jim Chalmers says. (David Crosling/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"We need to ensure, collectively as Australians, that the fair go is the defining part of our future and not just the defining part of our past.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAhead of the summit, there were calls for attendees to consider changes to capital gains tax and negative gearing, as well as an overhaul of the GST.\n\nWhile the treasurer said intergenerational fairness would be central to any changes, there would not be a rush on implementing reform.\n\n\"The best way to work out any additional steps beyond that is to do that in the government's usual consultative and considered way, which is what we're doing,\" he said.\n\n\"We didn't, at the conclusion of the roundtable, rewrite our policies in those areas. More broadly, intergenerational equity has been a motivation for so much of what we're already doing in tax.\"\n\nThe treasurer also confirmed proposed changes to tax on super balances over $3 million, would not be brought to parliament in the upcoming sitting fortnight, but would be brought in eventually.\n\nThe Treasurer said calls for tax reform at the summit would inform upcoming federal budgets. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"I proposed what is a pretty modest change, but a meaningful change which makes the system a bit more sustainable,\" Dr Chalmers said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It doesn't begin to be calculated until the second half of next year, and so we've got time to reintroduce that.\"\n\nWhile there was support at the economic summit for a road user charge for electric vehicle drivers, the treasurer said those who have petrol cars would not be double taxed for the measure.\n\nIt comes as shadow treasurer Ted O'Brien admitted the coalition got its tax position wrong ahead of the May federal election, when the opposition opposed broad tax cuts.\n\nBut he said he would not be surprised if the government introduced a raft of additional taxes.\n\n\"If you just keep on spending, you've got to get the money from somewhere,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"When you can't control your spending, you're just going to increase debt and increase taxes. That's pretty clear.\"",
