    "text": "Speculation is building one of Australia's most controversial tax breaks will be overhauled as the centrepiece of this year's federal budget , with senior government ministers refusing to categorically rule out changes despite days of reports.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Anthony Albanese , Labor has previously baulked at tinkering with the capital gains (CGT) discount following the party's particularly ill-fated attempt at the 2019 election.\n\nBut with young Australians becoming increasingly priced out of the property market , the budget desperately needing a way out of its structural deficit, and Treasurer Jim Chalmers speaking of the need to address the country's widening intergenerational divide, some signs are pointing towards a possible overhaul in the coming months.\n\nThe government's most senior ministers haven't ruled out changes to one of the naton's most contentious tax breaks. (Nine)\n\nWhy is the capital gains tax discount up for discussion?\n\nReaders would be forgiven for thinking all of this is old news \u2013 the capital gains tax discount seems to become a major political flashpoint every couple of years.\n\nIt was only in late 2024 that reports emerged of the government directing Treasury to investigate a potential overhaul of the tax break .\n\nThis time, there are a couple of fresh factors at play.\n\nThe first is a Greens-led Senate inquiry into the tax, which has received dozens of submissions and is due to report next month.\n\nThe second \u2013 and more significant \u2013 are reports, published first by the Australian Financial Review , that the government is considering changes to the CGT discount.\n\nThat, in turn, followed ALP national secretary Paul Erickson, the mastermind of Labor's last two election victories, hinting this year's budget on May 12 will include some significant, ambitious reform.\n\n\"You will see some pretty substantial contributions over the coming months from the PM and from the treasurer, and the lead-up to the budget that will set that out,\" he told the AFR over the weekend .\n\nSenior Labor figures have since had the opportunity to categorically rule out the changes, but declined.\n\nAnthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers are weighing up some \"pretty substantial\" policies this year, according to a key Labor powerbroker. (Alex Ellinghausen/SMH)\n\nTake a look at what Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said in October 2024, when he was asked to rule out changing the discount:\n\n\"I just did. And not only have I done that, the prime minister has made that clear.\"\n\nCompare that to yesterday morning, when Marles was asked about capital gains once again but wasn't quite as demonstrative:\n\n\"Our position in respect of housing policy is clear. And that hasn't changed. And nor has our position in respect of the tax arrangements around housing.\n\n\"And we've got to have more houses in this country and that is a real challenge.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The phone call that will have the world on notice \ufeff\n\nRichard Marles said the government's housing agenda \"hasn't changed\", but didn't categorically rule out changes to capital gains. (Dominic Lorrimer)\n\nWhy is the capital gains tax discount so controversial?\n\nAlongside negative gearing, the CGT discount provides property investors with generous tax incentives at the same time as housing has become unaffordable for many, particularly young, Australians.\n\nIntroduced in 1999 by the Howard government, the policy allows investors to sell an asset they've owned for at least a year and to only be taxed on half of the profit.\n\nWhile it applies to all types of assets, it has coincided with a significant increase in property prices:\n\nREAD MORE: How much more you could be paying on your mortgage after cash rate hike \ufeff\n\nUnsurprisingly, the policy is popular with many Australians who have benefited from it over the past three decades, and a proposal to wind back the provisions has been widely cited as a reason why Labor lost the 2019 federal election.\n\nBut, at the same time as the concession is costing the nation's coffers around $23 billion a year \u2013 a number that will only rise \u2013 the government desperately needs to find new revenue for the federal budget, which is forecast to be stuck in the red for the foreseeable future.\n\nParliamentary Budget Office modelling commissioned in early 2024 by independent senators Jacqui Lambie examined five options for winding back both negative gearing and the CGT tax discount for property, all of which included so-called \"grandfathering\" provisions\ufeff \u2013 that is, exemptions for existing property investors from the changes.\ufeff\n\nThe analysis found reducing the concessions could save the federal budget between $15.6 and $59.9 billion over the next 10 years, while also making housing more affordable.\n\nLeading economists including former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, Saul Eslake and Richard Holden have also thrown their support behind various changes to the CGT tax discount.\n\nHouse prices have skyrocketed since the introduction of the CGT discount in 1999. (Joe Armao)\n\nWould any changes get through parliament?\n\nOne factor in the government's favour is that, if it does decide to go ahead with winding back the tax discount for investment properties, the overhaul would likely sail through parliament.\n\nLabor easily has the numbers to get any bill through the lower house, and only needs the support of the Greens \u2013 who have long supported scrapping tax concessions for property investors \u2013 to get laws past the Senate, where the likes of Pocock and Lambie are also likely to lend their support.\n\n\"There's a real opportunity here for sensible reform to the capital gains tax discount on investment properties to incentivise the new housing supply our country so desperately need,\" Pocock said earlier this week.\n\n\"It won't solve housing affordability on its own but it will help.\"",

However, he insisted that it was similar to the original artwork, the paper reported.\n\nValentinetti was tasked with smudging out his work, which has left a ghost-like white blob on the angel's body.\n\nItaly's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni pictured on January 9.

    "text": "E\ufeffxclusive: Vasectomies are booming in Australia and many experts believe the rising cost of living could be a factor in younger men going under the knife.\n\nA new study from Adelaide University researchers has revealed the number of vasectomies performed on men aged 18-44 each year has spiked by more than 60 per cent.\n\nAbout \ufeff18,500 vasectomies were performed on men in that age range back in 2016.\n\nThe number of men undergoing vasectomies in Australia has risen sharply in the last decade. (Getty)\n\nIn 2024, the number had surged to more than \ufeff29,800.\n\nResearchers also found the \ufeffaverage number of vasectomies performed per month has increased by about 45 per cent, though the figure was much higher in some states.\n\nFor example, in NSW about 25 vasectomies were performed on men aged 18 to 44 per 100,000 male population per month in April 2016.\ufeff\n\nIn December 2024, that figure had jumped to 39 \u2013 an increase of 56 per cent.\n\nIn Tasmania, the number of \ufeffvasectomies were performed on men aged 18 to 44 per 100,000 male population per month rose from 41 in 2016 to 66 in 2024.\n\nThat's an increase of 61 per cent.\ufeff\n\nDr Jack Janetzki, lecturer in Pharmacy and Pharmacology at Adelaide University and co-author of the study, suspects the cost-of-living crisis played a role in the spike in vasectomy rates across the country.\n\n\"Rising housing costs, cost-of-living pressures and delayed partnership formation could all be associated with decisions to limit or forgo childbearing,\" he told nine.com.au.\n\n\"Vasectomy provides a definitive solution to limiting family size amid these pressures and people may now be making concrete decisions on family size at a greater rate.\"\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nIncreasing awareness and normalisation of vasectomy as a safe, effective and relatively simple form of contraception may be another factor.\n\nThere's also greater \ufeffvisibility of male reproductive responsibility now than there was 10 years ago, prompting some men to take on more contraceptive responsibility.\n\nNot to mention that vasectomy is much less invasive \ufeffthan permanent methods of female contraception like tubal ligation.\n\nThe rise in vasectomy rates across the country coincides with a steady decline in Australia's birth rate.\n\nThe nation's total fertility rate (TFR)\ufeff dipped to a record-breaking low of 1.48 in 2024 and is predicted to slip even lower to 1.42 this year, according to The Centre for Population.\n\n\"Vasectomy alone cannot explain Australia's falling birth rate but it likely acts as both a marker and mechanism of fertility decline,\" Janetzki said.\n\nData shows a marked rise in vasectomies in younger men, particularly those aged 18 to 24.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of young women aged 18 to 24 \ufeffgiving birth is declining.\n\nThis suggests young Australians are making decisions to limit fertility and are increasingly open to permanent contraception at younger ages \ufeff.\n\n\"Our findings likely reflect the changing intentions around family size and permanence of reproductive decisions, reinforcing trends towards delayed child bearing, fewer children overall or not choosing to have children at all,\" Janetzki said.",

    "text": "When was the last time you cleaned your microwave?\n\nIf you close the door, a little bit of food splatter or a slight smell is pretty easy to ignore.\n\nBut according to experts, the sooner you deal with the problem the better. Cleaning the microwave is also a lot simpler than some other appliances (namely, the dreaded oven).\n\nHow often should you clean your microwave?\n\nWell, it all depends on how often you use it, according to consumer group Choice.\n\nChoice suggests immediately removing any spills with a damp cloth.\n\nYou can also wipe the microwave interior down with a microfibre cloth immediately after cooking steamy foods (such as vegetables and rice) because it will be warm and damp, Choice says.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nJason Shipway runs a cleaning business and lives in Bunbury, Western Australia, on the traditional lands of the Noongar people.\n\n\"We clean houses weekly, fortnightly, monthly and I find the ones that we clean weekly, their microwaves are pretty much never dirty.\"\n\nMr Shipway suggests giving your microwave a proper clean about every two weeks \"to keep on top of it\".\n\nRozita Vaskoska says it's best to clean up food spills immediately. (Supplied: Rozita Vaskoska)\n\nAnd if you're worried that skipping a clean is too much of a health hazard, it's probably okay.\n\n\"The risks from not cleaning the microwave in general are very low,\" says Rozita Vaskoska, a microbiologist and senior scientist with the CSIRO.\n\nRecently prepared food coming into contact with old \"food remains\" could create a \"very low\" risk of contamination.\n\nBut Dr Vaskoska says cleaning up any food spills, splatters or leaks as soon as they happen eliminates that concern.\n\nOther than that, she suggests giving the inside a wipe-down every few days or weekly.\n\nWhat is the best way to clean the inside of a microwave?\n\nMr Shipway says the best solution is to use water, lemon slices and vinegar.\n\n\"Get a little bowl and fill it with one or two cups of water. Slice up a lemon [and add it to the bowl], add a few dashes of vinegar in there and then you just turn the microwave on high for 3 to 5 minutes.\"\n\nThis method loosens up old food grime and oil stains while also deodorising, Mr Shipway says.\n\n\"Everything will just wipe off really easily without potentially harming anything in the microwave.\"\n\nChoice recommends the same approach:\n\nAdding vinegar or lemon to a heat-proof bowl of water,\n\nto a heat-proof bowl of water, Running the microwave until the water is boiling ,\n\n, Leaving the microwave door closed for 5 minutes for the steam to loosen the residue and;\n\nfor the steam to loosen the residue and; Wiping the interior\n\nChoice suggests staying nearby while the microwave is on to make sure the solution doesn't boil over and warns that the bowl will be hot when you remove it.\n\n\"You can also remove the turntable [microwave plate], rinse it off and wipe each side down with a paper towel to let your microwave shine once more.\"\n\nThe turntable can also be cleaned in your sink or dishwasher (if it's dishwasher safe and small enough), Choice says.\n\nChoice says it's important to clean up food caught in cracks and crevices. (Adobe Stock)\n\nChoice also recommends wiping the exterior with a cloth and warm soapy water as part of a more thorough clean.\n\nLook for any gunk around dials and crevices (a toothbrush or toothpick may be called for).\n\nYou can even make a paste with water and bicarb soda and scrub gently to help tackle stubborn residue, Choice adds.\n\n\"Never use anything metal and make sure the microwave is unplugged before you start.\"\n\nDr Vaskoska recommends wiping down the inside of the microwave with warm water and a little dishwashing liquid.\n\n\"And, then washing the plate as [you would] any other dish would be sufficient.\"\n\nMethods to avoid\n\nHow to spring clean your wardrobe It's the kind of task that can seem overwhelming, but the change of season is the perfect opportunity to review what's in your wardrobe.\n\nMr Shipway says people often spray a degreaser inside their microwave to loosen up any build-up, but he doesn't recommend it.\n\n\"If there's any residue left behind, it's going to [spread] up into the internals of the microwave [when it heats up] and it could damage it.\"\n\nIf you're going to use any products inside the microwave ensure they are food safe, Mr Shipway says.\n\nChoice also advises against using harsh or specialist chemicals for the job.\n\nDr Vaskoska says \"conventional methods\" involving detergent, vinegar or baking soda are all good options.\n\n\"People should avoid abrasive chemicals or even some flammable chemicals, such as some alcohol.\"",

    "text": "Australia is heading to the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games with very high expectations.\n\nSince the nation won its first Winter Olympics medal \u2014 a bronze at the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer \u2014 Australia has never left a Games without at least one.\n\nThere is no doubt Australia is punching well above its weight.\n\nAnd from that first bronze all the way through to the record-breaking four medals the team won in Beijing, there has been a steady building of success.\n\nBut this rise has been hard-fought, with battles by athletes on the snow and ice, and by administrators in boardrooms and backrooms across the world.\n\nAnd it can all be traced back to a brutal snub by the Australian Olympic Federation the last time the Games were held in Cortina d'Ampezzo 70 years ago, and the fire that ignited in one of those athletes who was denied his place on the ice \u2014 Geoff Henke.\n\n'Aggressive' advocacy\n\n\"It's an aggressive sport,\" Henke tells ABC Sport from his home in Melbourne, the 98-year-old talking about the sport he used to play and remained a staunch supporter of his whole life, ice hockey.\n\n\"It seems to have bred a lot of aggressive people.\n\n\"And I was one of them, I suppose,\" he adds with a mischievous chuckle that belies his age.\n\nHenke's aggression on the ice can't be corroborated \u2014 although anyone who has ever watched ice hockey will have an idea that he's not far wrong \u2014 but it's his controlled aggression and advocacy for winter sports that have allowed him to leave his mark on the Australian sporting landscape that few others will ever come close to matching.\n\nGeoff Henke played hockey in Melbourne in the 1950s. 1958 Olympian Ivo Vesely is behind him to the left. (Supplied: Ice Legends Australia)\n\nIt's not by accident that Henke's name has become synonymous with winter sports.\n\nWorking as chef de mission for the Winter Games from 1976 until 1994, Henke lends his name to two Winter Olympics training centres in Australia, and was pivotal in the establishment of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia in 1994.\n\nBut it may surprise some to learn that he never made it to an Olympics as a competitor \u2014 albeit as a result of a disappointing decision made by officials.\n\n\"The Australian Ice Hockey Federation wanted to send a team to [the 1956 Winter Olympics in] Cortina,\" Henke told ABC Sport in November 2025.\n\n\"We were lucky at that stage, there were a lot of migrants coming out to Australia, and we had some Canadians and Czechs \u2014 they wouldn't make up the full team, but they certainly helped to create a good standard.\n\n\"With maybe three or four in the team, which would have been the case, we would have put up a fairly good showing.\"\n\nAlas, it didn't happen.\n\n\"The Australian Olympic Committee were very, very orientated to the Summer Games. And you could see why,\" Henke explains.\n\n\"The then-secretary-general [of the Australian Olympic Committee] Sir Edgar Tanner \u2026 he was very much involved with boxing.\n\n\"He had the opinion that the Olympic Games, as far as Australia goes, should only enhance three sports: One was swimming, of course, track and field, and his own sport, boxing.\n\n\"He was very bigoted and biased towards it all, and, in the end, the committee was influenced by him. He kind of made, really, all the decisions for them.\n\n\"So that's what happened. We were all ready to go, designs had been made for uniforms and all the other bits and pieces, we'd been training, some of the members coming from Sydney and so forth, all that was being organised.\n\n\"And we didn't go.\"\n\nHow the Cortina snub turned into Australian winter sports' gain\n\nGeoff Henke has helped hundreds of skiers achieve their goals. (Getty Images: Jono Searle)\n\nHenke had the chance to go four years later, but the Cortina snubbing had left a deep scar \u2014 scars that were matched by the battering the aged Australian team that was sent.\n\n\"I was actually asked [to go to Squaw Valley] but declined, as did a couple of other players,\" Henke says.\n\n\"We just didn't like what was going on. We had our own businesses to enhance, and I withdrew from it.\n\n\"The team had three very good Czechs, one was my centre man, Ivo Vesely, but they played against Czechoslovakia. When the Czech players knew they'd be meeting the Australian Czechs, they really hammered our boys.\n\n\"Two of our boys finished up in the hospital after that, and another one was injured.\n\n\"They didn't win a game and didn't look like winning a game.\n\n\"It was a tragedy. Had we gone four years earlier, our standard would have been much higher.\"\n\nGeoff Henke now has two centres named after him, in Melbourne and Brisbane. (Getty Images: Raoul Wegat)\n\nDespite the indignity meted out on the Australian team, Henke says he still regrets not going.\n\n\"I think it was a mistake,\" he says.\n\n\"When I think of it now, I should have taken it. But you feel very strongly about those things.\n\n\"Anyway, that's the past.\"\n\nHenke's Olympic disappointment turned into Australia's long-term Olympic gain, steeling within him a desire to advocate for Australian athletes who would otherwise be ignored.\n\nHe was instrumental in establishing Falls Creek as a skiing destination, helping build the first ski lifts in the area in 1961, and, though his involvement in the Falls Creek racing club \u2014 where his Olympian daughter Joanne McDougall (nee Henke) trained \u2014 was named the Australian Ski Federation's first ever Alpine director in 1972.\n\nUnder the patronage of the then-secretary-general of the AOC, Julius Patching, a man Henke said was like a father to him, Henke became the chef de mission and began work on realising a new funding model for winter sports athletes.\n\n\"What I was always concerned about was that people didn't really understand what's required to win these medals,\" Henke said.\n\nSo he made them realise.\n\nThe Falls Creek trip that sparked a revolution\n\nLaura Peel is one of the many athletes to benefit from the Geoff Henke water ramp in Brisbane. (Supplied: Ben Cocklin)\n\nHenke took the opportunity in 1981 to have an AOC meeting at Falls Creek and allow the members of the committee to see winter sports in action.\n\nHenke recalls that Tom Blue, an Olympic selector and head of the justification committee, \"couldn't believe anybody would be silly enough to get out and be involved in sport in a climate like this.\n\n\"He was just mystified about this existing.\"\n\nBut despite that mysticism, Henke said he never had anything but support from the AOC members in establishing a funding model for the nation's Winter Olympians.\n\n\"I had a great friend in John Coates, who became the [AOC] president, and we were both vice-presidents together \u2014 we knew one another very well, and I supported John very strongly to become the AOC president, which he did, and I had tremendous access to him.\n\n\"He listened to me all the way, and anything I wanted; there was not one thing that we ever, ever put up that he questioned.\n\n\"'Whatever you want, whatever you think, I'm behind you,\" he would say.\n\n\"I give him tremendous credit for that, and you can see the results from that.\n\n\"They were so supportive, which was a great change from the old Edgar Tanner days.\"\n\nNow, Australian athletes are not only competing at the top level, but have the support both at home and abroad to challenge for medals.\n\nA lasting legacy of Henke's involvement in the Games is the water jump facility in Brisbane, an incongruous location for a winter sport training facility no doubt, but one that has paid off dramatically.\n\nThe water jump in Brisbane has played host to many athletes from around the world, including world aerials champion No\u00e9 Roth. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\nHenke noted that former aerialist Kirstie Marshall, who he cites as one of the best ever aerial skiers and was denied an Olympic medal only by a knee injury, had to undergo enormous hardship to compete on the world tour.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"The conditions that she had to endure in a nation that couldn't even spell the words aerial skiing or Kirstie Marshall, it's just remarkable how she, how she financed it,\" he said.\n\n\"The Brisbane water jump ramp, that's been remarkable, and look at some of the great skiers we produced there.\n\n\"When you think Laura Peel and Jackie Cooper, and of course Kirstie Marshall, Alisa Camplin. Before that one, we had no facilities at all, no financial support \u2026 the facilities they had, they were dangerous, really.\"\n\nHenke was the chef de mission when Australia won its first-ever Winter Olympics medal, a bronze in the men's 4x5,000m short track speed skating relay in Lillehammer in 1994.\n\nNow, 22 years later, the fruits of his labour could be about to be realised tenfold at the same location where his own dreams of Olympic participation were crushed.\n\nAnd what a fitting reward that will be for Australia's own Mr Winter Olympics.",

    "text": "Bl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh's life was completely changed six years ago when she travelled to Galway for an annual arts festival in Ireland.\n\nWhile on a night out with friends she ran into a group of people she knew from her home town of Mullingar.\n\nOne of those people was Jonathan Moran, who later that night at a house party violently raped her with a bottle in a garden shed.\n\nFive years after the incident, Moran was handed a nine-year prison sentence with one year suspended.\n\nThe court heard Raleigh was left with extensive physical injuries that required months of treatment in a sexual assault unit.\n\nThe impact of the sexual assault had all-consuming impacts on Raleigh's life. Sport, which had been a constant in her life since she was young, became a point of both further isolation and healing.\n\n'Lost so much of myself'\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the assault, Raleigh found herself sad, angry and feeling extremely isolated. She said even showering became \"really, really hard\".\n\n\"I'd lost so much of myself \u2014 anything I kind of enjoyed doing as a young person in their early 20s, like going out and to bars, things like that, I just didn't do,\" Raleigh told ABC Sport following the release of her new book, Aftermath.\n\n\"My attacker was from the same town as me and so going into my local town to get my nails done or my hair done \u2026 They were the kind of things I used to love before and I really lost that whole thing.\"\n\nOne of the hardest parts for Raleigh was that between the assault and the conviction, Moran could not be publicly named. For five years, Raleigh had to watch her attacker continue socialising, working and playing rugby in the same town while she awaited the trial.\n\nBl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh and her two brothers. (Supplied: Bl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh)\n\nRaleigh waived her right to anonymity so Moran could be publicly named following the conviction.\n\nThe rugby club she grew up in and around, Mullingar Rugby Football Club, suddenly felt like it was being weaponised against her. Moran was a well-known player there.\n\n\"My dad, brothers, uncle, all played at our local club \u2026 So every Saturday, I was at rugby matches when the boys were playing. My parents, if they were going out, they were going out with people from the rugby club,\" she said.\n\n\"All these memories from my childhood, when I look back, are all linked to the club. And I think that kind of shows how sort of woven into the community the club is.\"\n\nBl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh grew up around Mullingar Rugby Club. (Supplied: Bl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh)\n\nOne of Raleigh's brothers played at Mullingar when the attack happened. As this is where Moran also played, Raleigh's brother left to join a rival club \u2014 something that didn't go down well with some in the community, Raleigh said.\n\n\"I felt really guilty that my brother had lost his club. His sport was huge to him and he had lost that \u2026 It was just really, really hard and there was a lot of guilt and anger \u2014 and I suppose there's still anger kind of in me towards that,\" she said.\n\nMullingar RFC expelled Moran from the club and issued a public statement to the Irish Times: \"Mullingar Rugby Football Club was deeply shocked and saddened to learn on Monday of the crime committed by former member Jonathan Moran. We condemn and are appalled by this act.\"\n\nRaleigh was disappointed with the response from the club, particularly in a lack of acknowledgement of the pain caused to her and her family.\n\nShe said it felt like a message had gone around the club: \"Don't say a thing, don't talk about it, don't talk to Bl\u00e1thnaid.\"\n\nBl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh and her brothers with Aftermath. (Supplied: Bl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh)\n\n\"In those five years leading up to the court case, nobody knew what was going on, and that was fine, and we just kind of put our heads down and got through,\" she said.\n\n\"I used to always say when they know, they're going to be so annoyed that he was still playing or mixing with them, or they're going to think how dare he.\n\n\"And then it came out, and it was on national news, national papers. It was everywhere \u2026 It got huge attention. And I don't know why, but it just was so evident that there was nothing from the club. There was just radio silence.\n\n\"I think one former player messaged and that was it \u2026 They had to be asked to take down his photos celebrating him off their social media \u2026 I remember thinking, there has definitely been like a committee meeting and they've discussed this and I remember being so hurt that the decision that they sat and discussed was to say nothing \u2026 That was so heartbreaking.\"\n\nThe club was contacted by the ABC.\n\nRaleigh said she particularly felt bad no one reached out to her brother to say \"we see why you left now\" or \"so sorry that happened to you and you had to leave\".\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nShe also wanted the club as a sporting organisation to make a strong stand for others to see.\n\nShe said rugby didn't have a great reputation for sexual violence and referenced the recent \"rugby rape trial\" - where Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding were found not guilty of rape in a high-profile case \u2014 and \"the French rugby story\" where in 2024 a French court jailed three rugby players over gang rape that included Irishman Denis Coulson.\n\n\"So when you think of sport and gender-based violence in Ireland, rugby is very much linked with it,\" she said.\n\n\"That kind of annoys me about the sport, because I think, OK, you do have a problem. You do need to do something here.\"\n\n'Getting some control'\n\nRaleigh continued to try and piece her life back together, including wanting to feel better in her body. She tried to take back up running, but found she would often panic.\n\nThen she joined a boxing gym.\n\n\"I loved it. I felt like I was getting some control [and] it was really good physically,\" Raleigh said.\n\n\"I would release that anger [and] guilt, but it was also a complete distraction, because boxing is so technical, I didn't have time to think of anything else. So it was like, for that hour, that 45 minutes I was training, I didn't think of anything else.\"\n\nShe said when she started light sparring, it was a huge step because it was letting someone in her personal space. Something she felt she could do because she found the community at the gym such a welcoming and safe space.\n\n\"And a lot of the times, a lot of the classes had more men, so I would be sparring against men. So I found it really intimidating at the start. I had to train my brain to think like he's not trying to hurt me, he's not going to hurt me, he's not attacking me,\" she said.\n\n\"Because for the first little while, I used to put my hands up and just kind of take it, and these guys were like, 'Oh my God'. But that release and also that sort of mental thing of, well, I kind of know how to protect myself if I have to, I could throw a punch.\n\n\"I felt fit and strong, and it was the first time I had sort of a sense of achievement about me since the attack had happened.\"\n\nYet while boxing has helped her in the aftermath of the trial, she said it was her horseriding and showjumping that got her through the five years following the attack.\n\nBl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh said horseriding helped her during some of her darkest days. (Supplied: Bl\u00e1thnaid Raleigh)\n\nShe has three horses \u2014 Juno, Bravo and Jagger.\n\n\"If I hadn't had the horses, I don't know how I sort of would have got through it, because they were my non-negotiable. They had to be fed. So you couldn't let them starve.\n\n\"It was the one thing that I had to do when everything else was going so terribly. So now, even this year, I was doing my 2026 goals \u2026 and my goals are all surrounding the horses.\n\n\"I feel like I'm in the stage where I really want to push on and get more competitive \u2026 That's definitely my driving force in life now and in sport \u2014 everything I do is for that.\"",

(ABC News: Brooke Tindall)\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria and east coast barramundi fisheries close from October and November respectively until February 1, to protect the species during its spawning period.\n\nPauline Jacob from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) said the closures ensured a long-lasting supply.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is ensure that we're continually growing our fisheries to enable those fish to be at a sustainable level and remain on people's plates at the dinner table.\"\n\nShe said the barramundi closures were among the DPI's longest-standing measures in fishery management, introduced in 1981 after stock surveys and studies into barramundi spawning.\n\nNathan Rynn said his grandfather was a fisher when the closures were brought in.\n\n\"Ten years on from the closure, people like our grandfather said they felt worried at the time, but it did help the fishery.\"",

    "text": "Loading...\n\nCreative prison programs are celebrated for their ability to heal and transform incarcerated people.\n\nBut are they enough to break the cycle?\n\nThis story includes conversations about abuse, trauma and drug use, which could be triggering for some readers.\n\nIt's a sunny day and members of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra (ASO) are dressed in the requisite head-to-toe black, fiddling with their instruments and looking over their sheet music as they prepare to perform.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe gathered crowd isn't really there to see them \u2014 eight women with ukuleles who follow them on stage are the stars of the show.\n\nThese women also happen to be incarcerated in the Adelaide Women's Prison (AWP).\n\n\"All the songs you'll hear today were penned inside these walls,\" declares their mentor, Barkindji woman and singer-songwriter Nancy Bates.\n\n\"Through the laughter and the tears, we have dived deeply, searching for melodies and words, making light in the darkness of prison.\"\n\nThe audience comprises corrections staff, inmates and their loved ones.\n\nSome of them are openly weeping.\n\nAudience members laughed and cried throughout the performance. ( )\n\nAlong with AWP inmates and staff, the Songbirds' (the name given to the program's participants) family members were invited to attend the concert. ( )\n\nAs the sound of the orchestra swells behind them, the first woman begins singing.\n\nLoading...\n\nThis performance is believed to be the biggest ever held in an Australian jail.\n\nIt's the culmination of the Songbirds music program, which saw 12 inmates turn some of their darkest experiences into music under Bates's direction.\n\nIt's also the subject of the award-winning Songs Inside documentary \u2014 written, directed and produced by Shalom Almond.\n\nThe project is more than just a film for Almond, who has worked with fellow producers Katrina Lucas and Lauren Drewery to challenge negative perceptions of incarcerated women and advocate for systemic change.\n\nSince Songs Inside's 2024 debut, they have screened the film more than 60 times in communities and prisons across Australia. A few Songbirds (the name given to the program's participants) are selected out of a group of five to speak at each event.\n\nErin and Fabiann, who were both released from jail during or shortly after the program, are two of them.\n\nFabiann was one of eight Songbirds (out of the original 12 that started the program) who performed with the ASO. ( )\n\nWhile Erin left the Songbirds music program early because she was released from prison, she's still involved with the Songs Inside project. ( )\n\nIn many ways, the experience has changed their lives.\n\nOver a four-and-a-half-month period in 2023, the pair gathered with their fellow Songbirds at least twice a week in the depths of AWP's medium-security unit.\n\nFor two hours, prison life faded as Bates taught them how to read sheet music and play chords on their ukuleles, before they practised the songs they'd written about love and their fears and pain.\n\nA correctional officer would watch over them along with Almond, who was joined by a second camera person.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"If you look at the women who have been part of this journey from the premiere to now, the growth and self-discovery we've all experienced speaks volumes,\" says Erin.\n\n\"We've reconnected with ourselves, rediscovered our strengths and embraced our potential.\"\n\nFabiann feels like Songs Inside has shone a light on the reasons \"people aren't getting any better, what is happening in jail [and] what people are coming out to\" \u2014 from addiction, to trauma, to unemployment and housing insecurity.\n\nBut neither the music program, the film about it, a subsequent advocacy project, nor support from the Songs Inside team, could entirely shield the participants from the reality of re-entering the outside world.\n\nAbout two years on from their release from AWP, Erin and Fabiann are still trying to rebuild their lives. The experts say this is a common reality.\n\nThings had been going well for Fabiann in the program, but when she left prison in October 2023, she felt alone.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"When I was incarcerated, I lost everything,\" she says. \"My whole life was put out on the side of the road and I didn't have any connections with my family.\"\n\n\"I got out with nothing but the clothes on my back.\"\n\nThe reality of life beyond prison makes her feel something akin to guilt when she tells inmates at screenings that they too can turn their lives around.\n\nThe challenges weren't unexpected for Almond, who stayed in contact with Fabiann beyond prison, driving her five hours back to her hometown and helping her set up a life outside AWP.\n\nFabiann is now living in her own house, and has been working a part-time job alongside studying to become a social worker, while also touring the country for Songs Inside screenings. She doesn't think she would be where she is today without the support of the team behind the program.\n\nAerial view of Adelaide Women's Prison in Songs Inside. ( )\n\n\"The fact they can release people out in the street to nothing and then wonder why they're back there in a week is beyond me \u2026 what chance did they have?\"\n\nErin's mid-program exit from AWP \u2014 with a sleeping bag in lieu of a place to live \u2014 was different to Fabiann's in that it was caught on camera.\n\nBates had made a commitment to continue the music program with Erin post-release, and Almond filmed what was meant to be their second meet-up.\n\nStruggling with homelessness, Erin didn't appear that day, leading to one of the film's most searing moments.\n\n\"It was probably a big call to expect her to arrive today and step back into the program with me,\" Bates reflects to camera.\n\nErin describes life since her release from AWP as a \"constant battle\" she \"wasn't fully prepared for\".\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I'd love to see more programs like [Songbirds] in prisons,\" she says. \"But I think it's just as important to have more support for when people get out.\n\n\"That's when it really hits you \u2014 trying to rebuild from nothing, trying to find your place again. Having things like housing, work opportunities, mental health support \u2026 those things matter.\n\n\"If even a fraction of the money spent on locking someone up for a year went instead into real rehabilitation and proper transition support, that revolving door wouldn\u2019t be spinning the way it does.\"\n\nA few weeks after her release from prison, Erin found temporary housing with Almond's help and made her way back to the group.\n\nBut having only secured a transitional housing contract, she faced the very real possibility of ending up right where she started.\n\n\"I want to move forward. I want the last two years of effort to mean something. I want a chance to live outside the cycle \u2014 not just survive, but actually build a life,\" Erin says.\n\n\" And yet, without secure housing it feels like the system is stacked against me. \"\n\nSongs Inside is Almond's second documentary in the prison space.\n\nIt came after 2017's Prisoners and Pups, which drove her to create a film that offered a deeper look at the issues incarcerated women face both inside and coming back out into the community.\n\nPrisoners and Pups was also filmed inside AWP, in 2015, and followed inmates as they trained former racing greyhounds for adoption. ( )\n\nA little over a year on from its release, Almond thinks Songs Inside's ability to shine a light on the struggles of incarcerated women without \"ramming them down\" audiences' throats is one of its greatest strengths.\n\nBut she's realistic about the limitations.\n\nAlmond says she hopes the \"kinds of eyeballs we've been able to get in front of the film ... are going to be able to make real change\". ( )\n\nAlmond, right, filming Bates, left, appears in Songs Inside only as a disembodied voice. ( )\n\n\"Nancy [Bates] has this incredibly special way of engaging the women, drawing them into her world and creating an emotionally safe space for them to be able to open up,\" Almond says.\n\n\" Music programs 100 per cent have their place in prison, but the issues around addiction, trauma, lack of housing, all the very complex challenges women face when they get out ... music is definitely not strong enough to overcome any of that. \"\n\nSongs Inside was released at a time when the number of adult women incarcerated in Australia had increased by almost a third over the preceding decade.\n\nThe number of women being sent to prison continues to rise, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women disproportionately represented in the prison system.\n\nThen there are the reoffending (recidivism) rates.\n\nIn Australia, 53.6 per cent of adults released from prison return to corrective services with a new correctional sanction (prison sentence or a community corrections order) within two years. In South Australia, that figure is 36.8 per cent.\n\nA spokesperson for SA's Department for Correctional Services said the state has a range of programs that provide \"community-based accommodation and reintegration support\", which provide \"clear pathways to stability\" and deliver lower recidivism.\n\nDr Mindy Sotiri, executive director of the Justice Reform Initiative (JRI), says films like Songs Inside help both \"people inside by giving a voice to stories that are often hidden\" as well as those of us outside, \"who haven't really understood\" why people end up there.\n\nBut she also thinks there's a tension between telling stories such as Erin and Fabiann's and deepening public understanding.\n\nStream Songs Inside on ABC iview A group of incarcerated women sign up for a unique songwriting program, which for some opens up deep scars and for others proves to be life-changing.\n\n\"Any public storytelling that any of us do then exists forever, and ultimately the power needs to be held by the people who have the stories to tell,\" she considers.\n\nFabiann and Erin say they have no regrets about sharing their stories for the world to see.\n\nA 2017 documentary made about Bell Shakespeare's Youth Justice Program took a different approach to sharing the stories of its participants.\n\nThe film, Kings of Baxter, followed a group of juvenile inmates as they worked together over 12 weeks to stage Macbeth.\n\nJoanna Erskine, who oversees the initiative, says the team knew very little identifying information about the young people they worked with. And in the film, none of the participants' faces were shown in their entirety to maintain their anonymity.\n\nThe program sees the young people use Shakespeare's works as a tool for critical and creative thinking that can help them explore their experiences without directly talking about themselves.\n\n\"A couple of weeks ago \u2026 one of the young women was picking up on the regret Macbeth has for his actions and she said, 'That's how I feel about being here'. That wasn't something we asked her to do,\" Erskine says.\n\nBarbed wire fence at Adelaide Women's Prison in Songs Inside. ( )\n\n\"Because of Shakespeare's perceived difficulty, once they get it, it unlocks something in them and they're like: 'What else can I do?'\"\n\nSince her team knows little more than the first names of the young people they work with, Erskine says they are unable to track reoffending rates.\n\n\"But what we are able to measure is the skills developed,\" she says.\n\n\"We know, for example, they are more confident doing a job interview \u2026 or they carry themselves in a different way because they feel pride in what they've achieved.\"\n\nDr Sotiri says she isn't aware of any data on reoffending rates for people who have taken part in creative prison programs in Australia.\n\n\"That's not a thing that's commonly measured in Australia,\" she explains.\n\n\"But there's quite a lot of research that says if you create an identity and social connections outside of the justice system, you are much less likely to go back to prison.\"\n\nAnd yet, Flinders University criminology lecturer Jeremy Ryder says creative prison programs are not only rare, but \"really vulnerable to being cancelled\".\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Often in prison, the courses that you do are focused on criminogenic risks and needs like alcohol and drugs, managing your emotions and propensity for violence.\"\n\nWhile Dr Ryder thinks these programs have their place, he says they can reinforce the idea that inmates are \"defective\" human beings.\n\nCreative programs, on the other hand, \"are grounded in building up confidence, strength, reintegrating that person into a group and giving them skills\".\n\nCombined with other supports, he says they allow incarcerated people to \"create an identity that overpowers their former identities \u2026 providing a pathway from prisoner back to citizen\".\n\nHowever everyone, from the Songbirds to the experts, are in agreement: creative programs can only do so much.\n\n\"Someone in prison might have got an enormous amount from participation in a creative program, but the emptiness of what is available for people when they're released can feel even more shocking in a way,\" Dr Sotiri continues.\n\n\"And that's a failure of a number of systems.\"\n\nTo reduce reoffending rates, Dr Sotiri says at-risk people need to be better supported in the community to avoid incarceration, and those who do end up in prison, need the underlying reasons addressed.\n\nDr Ryder puts it bluntly.\n\nUkulele strumming in Songs Inside. ( )\n\n\"People want the 'art saved' [all] story, and it can happen, but it's got to happen in conjunction with other things,\" he says.\n\n\"A ukulele can only get you so far when you don't have a job, and insecure housing.\"\n\nThe Songbirds music program is expected to return to AWP this year, and Almond wants to resume screening Songs Inside in schools, \"as an educational tool and as a deterrent\".\n\nErin knows the Songbirds and the Songs Inside team don't have the power to make the changes they'd like to see on their own.\n\n\"If it was as simple as five women standing on stage sharing their stories to make systemic change, it would have been done by now,\" she says.\n\n\"But hopefully we can open the ... minds of those that can.\"\n\nFor now, Erin and Fabiann hope to continue using their lived experience to help others.\n\nThe former is studying for a certificate in women's advocacy, while the latter is due to complete her social work studies early this year, and hopes to set up a peer support program for inmates.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"They feel more comfortable speaking to us than they do counsellors or other people,\" Fabiann says.\n\n\"To sit across from them and know exactly the pain they're sitting in and empower them to believe that coming back is possible, because the person sitting across from them has done it, it's living proof that with the right consistency, community and supports, they can do it too.\"\n\nWatch the Songs Inside documentary free on ABC iview.\n\nVictims of crime may be linked to some of the article's participants.

    "text": "A two-time winner of Australia's Best Takeaway Fish and Chips says it has been forced to increase prices considerably following Western Australia's demersal fishing reforms.\n\nMajor changes to the state's fishing rules came into force on January 1, closing commercial fishing on the west coast.\n\nHooked on Middleton owner Shane Vale said the flow-on impact was already being felt further afield in Albany, 400 kilometres south of Perth.\n\n\"We're suffering and we're actually not even in the area where there is any bans at the moment,\" he said.\n\nFish and Chips from Hooked on Middleton in Albany. (ABC News: Samantha Goerling)\n\nRising prices and limited availability\n\nFishers along WA's south coast have been securing higher prices for their catch in Perth, due to regular supplies from the north being thin on the ground.\n\n\"The fishermen have told us that if you want to keep buying the fish, we have to match the price that they can get in Perth or get close to it,\" Mr Vale said.\n\nHe has had to raise his menu prices to accommodate the cost, with a serve of fried or grilled nannygai rising from $31 to $40.\n\n\"Since I have put the price of our nannygai and our pink snapper up by 30 per cent, we have definitely sold, well, probably 50 per cent less of our full serves,\" he said.\n\nFresh Nannygai is a popular fish on the Hooked on Middleton menu. (ABC News: Samantha Goerling)\n\nAdditionally, availability of Spanish mackerel, which Mr Vale sources from WA's northern fisheries, has diminished.\n\n\"I have not been able to buy that this week and that's the first time in 20 years,\" he said.\n\n\"So I presume that the demand for that in Perth has skyrocketed.\"\n\nAdapting menus\n\nWhile the 50 per cent catch reduction was \"officially\" in place from January 1 this year, its practical implication is yet to be fully worked out.\n\nA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development spokesperson said the state government was still considering how the reduction will be implemented.\n\nWA fisheries minister defends demersal fish ban A \"judgement call\" about a permanent commercial fishing ban for demersal species went further than the advice handed to her, WA's Fisheries Minister Jackie Jarvis says.\n\nMr Vale is now examining options for premium fish dishes that would absorb the elevated costs.\n\n\"I'm thinking of many other ways to be able to use less fish in smaller portions that people can still be happy with,\" he said.\n\nHe expected to adjust his menu further as the impact of the catch reduction became clearer.\n\n\"I would hope that we are still going to get some fish from Perth,\" he said.\n\n\"I do need a premium fish for that customer base that we do have \u2026 so I think it's a waiting game.\"\n\nHooked on Middleton has twice been named Australia\u2019s best takeaway fish and chip shop.

(ABC News: Samantha Goerling)\n\nAlbany fisher Drew Mayfield said despite the recent higher prices, he still had significant concern for the future.\n\n\"Everyone's asking for fish and you just can't supply it,\" he said.\n\n\"The weather's not always good down here, so we only catch what we catch for the year and that doesn't fluctuate too much.\"\n\nDemersal fishing reforms introduced in Western Australia. (Supplied: DPIRD)\n\nPreviously, Mr Mayfield said he sold all his catch to local buyers.\n\n\"So now it's gone a lot further, it's all going to Perth because of the ban that we're supposed to be getting,\" he said.\n\n\" You just have to chase the better dollars for the uncertainty of when you actually will and won't be able to fish. \"\n\nDrew Mayfield is bracing for the commercial catch to be reduced. (Supplied)\n\nMr Mayfield said it had been challenging to raise prices on long-term local customers.\n\n\"It's pretty hard because the guys I do sell to I know personally, I've been to their 50 or 60th birthdays and things like that,\" he said.\n\n\"They know it has to happen, it's still not as much as what we're getting in Perth for the fish so still trying to take it easy on them, but it's obviously going to make their business struggle as well.\"",

    "text": "Oscar Piastri insists the painful ending to his F1 title bid last season has only strengthened his resolve to be the \"nice person\" who brings the Formula 1 world drivers' crown back to Australia.\n\nPiastri led the F1 drivers' championship for the majority of last season, but a form slump in the final third of the season meant the Australian finished third behind champion and teammate, Lando Norris and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.\n\nPiastri was also on the wrong end of a few controversial moments for the McLaren team, but the Melbourne-born racer was adamant he had been given a \"fair shot\" by the UK-based team.\n\nPiastri came so close, but these minor moments let the F1 title slip away Oscar Piastri missed out on winning the Formula 1 drivers world championship by just 13 points to his teammate Lando Norris, the culmination of multiple small moments throughout the season that cost him dearly.\n\nAhead of the 2026 season, Piastri said he expected the same even-handed approach as he reflected on his 2025 near-miss by revealing his pride in how he had handled the late-season drama.\n\nAs the pair faced the media at McLaren's HQ in Woking, before a season of sweeping changes to F1's cars and technical regulations, Piastri sounded buoyed and refreshed by the support he had received on his return to Australia.\n\n\"It was nice to go back and spend some time with my family and just take a bit of a step away from F1 and racing,\" the 24-year-old said.\n\n\"Going back home this Christmas was a bit different to the previous summers; definitely a few more people knew who I was.\n\n\"And just the support I had from being in the title fight and the amount of comments I got just about the way I go about things was honestly nice to hear.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm not here just to be known as just a 'nice person' or someone that goes about things in a way that people think is good. I'm here to try and become an F1 world champion \u2014 but I'm very proud of the way I've gone about things.\n\n\"There's a lot of lessons from last year and, yes, the ending was a bit painful, but you can treat that in one of two ways.\n\n\"Either you can let it bring you down or let it give you more confidence and motivation for the future \u2014 and with such a different rule-set this year, that's been a very good avenue to channel any motivation I gained over the off-season.\"\n\nPiastri had returned home post-season amid much indignation about how he had seemingly been the one to suffer from most of the contentious calls McLaren made when trying to implement the team's much-trumpeted Papaya Rules, which preach driver equality amid a team-first environment.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWhen asked by AAP whether he felt he had had a raw deal, the driver played the team man as usual.\n\n\"I think I got a fair shot last year, and I'm expecting that to stay exactly the same,\" Piastri said.\n\n\"That's definitely not to say that certain things could have been done better last year \u2014 I think that was probably clear for everyone watching \u2014 but I think, for me, at no point were there any bad intentions, or any times I questioned the intentions.\n\n\"Things could have been done better, handled differently, but that's part of elite sport and F1. You're never going to get every decision right or make every single person happy.\n\n\"So I think I got a fair shot last year, and we're working on how we can improve things and make sure that we try and become stronger.\"\n\nAfter testing the new smaller, nippier McLaren last week at the start of F1's brave new world in Barcelona, Piastri reported it was \"quite different to last year\" but \"not as alien as we might have feared\".\n\nAfter further testing sessions in Bahrain later this month, Piastri's eyes are set firmly on his home season-opener in Melbourne in March, where last year he skidded off when in line for a podium finish.\n\n\"Hopefully, it goes a bit better than last year, but it's going to be such an unknown for everybody that at this point, I'm just trying to maximise the time I've got in Bahrain testing and hit the ground running,\" he said.\n\n\"But for me, after the amount of support I gained over the last 12 months, especially in Australia, it's going to be nice to be back racing at home.\"\n\nAAP",

(ABC News: Andy Kennedy)\n\nJudge says decision not political\n\nChief Justice Bell said Justice Rigg did not make the decision to close the bridge as authorities had already made that call, adding the legislature expressly gave the court responsibility for the decision.\n\n\"Her Honour's decision was not a 'political' judgement but involved the careful weighing of the common law and constitutionally protected right to free speech and public assembly with considerations such as public safety,\" the chief justice said.\n\nHe said social cohesion was not enhanced when judicial decisions were attacked in a way that betrayed an \"ignorance\" of the law and the judge's reasoning.\n\nChief Justice Bell said such attacks were a form of misinformation that undermined trust in the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\n\"They corrosively suggest or imply that the community cannot have confidence the judiciary is independent and that judges are not conscientiously and in good faith endeavouring to do their jobs consistent with their judicial oaths,\" the chief justice said.\n\n\" That is regrettable to say the least. Some might call it irresponsible. \"\n\nChief Justice Bell says the former prime minister's comments are \"misconceived\". (ABC News: Liam Patrick)\n\nThe chief justice pointed out he presided over a Court of Appeal decision later in the year to prevent a protest at the Sydney Opera House, which he said involved a \"similar weighing exercise and risk assessment\".\n\nMr Abbott told the ABC he stood by his comment.\n\n\"This is a separation of powers issue. Whether a political protest goes ahead or not should be a question for the executive government not for judges,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\nInside NSW government chat group's Harbour Bridge march reaction Documents obtained by the ABC reveal internal discussions within the NSW government did not align with the external NSW Police messaging that the march could have been \"catastrophic\".\n\nDeaths threats aimed at judges\n\nChief Justice Bell said two Supreme Court judges received death threats in the past 18 months after being subjected to highly personalised and misconceived criticism in some sections of the media.\n\nThe judge reiterated his concern at the \"simplistic\" criticism of judges who had granted bail where the prisoner had later reoffended with tragic consequences.\n\n\"The decision to grant bail to any person charged with a serious offence is not risk free,\" he said.\n\n\"On the other hand, there is a risk of doing irreparable harm to individuals ultimately found to be not guilty of any crime by imprisoning them for long periods.\"",

    "text": "Thank you for reading our live coverage of the 2026 Sydney Summit, hosted by the Committee for Sydney think tank and supported by the Herald. A team of reporters is on the ground at ICC Sydney to bring you the latest as the summit continues this afternoon.\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s summit is \u201cthe bold city\u201d.\n\nThere is a packed roster of talent speaking at the 2026 Sydney Summit. Staff photographers\n\nSo far, we have heard from NSW Planning Minister Paul Scully, arguing that \u201cgovernment systems have become so riddled with a culture of no, that they have become anything but bold\u201d. Scully singled out opposition to development as a major obstacle to economic and housing growth, admitting NSW was \u201cbehind where [it] wanted to be\u201d on its housing targets.\n\nIt was a similar sentiment from federal Housing Minister Clare O\u2019Neil, who criticised the uneven way in which housing was being introduced in Sydney, with well resourced councils knocking back \u201csensible\u201d increases in density while those further afield picked up the slack, despite lacking necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe State of the City report by the Committee for Sydney and BDO, presented at today\u2019s summit, identified Parramatta, Liverpool and Bankstown as among the city\u2019s most overcrowded centres.\n\nNSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane reiterated that she was \u201cpro-housing\u201d, including in her own eastern suburbs electorate, but cautioned against throwing \u201cslings and arrows\u201d at the east, when there were 4500 people per square kilometre in Woollahra, compared to 3300 in Parramatta.\n\nThe Herald\u2019s incoming editor, Jordan Baker, asked both Scully and Sloane whether the state government should move to acquire defence sites this week identified by a federal audit as suitable for sale, including Victoria Barracks and the HMAS Penguin.\n\nScully confirmed Homes NSW had made inquiries about \u201cpotential options\u201d for Victoria Barracks, but ruled out aggressive redevelopment, such as \u201cgoing in and bulldozing it and replacing it with huge apartment towers\u201d. Sloane raised concerns about \u201cthe federal government offloading assets onto state governments without a clear plan\u201d, while both politicians said any development of the site would need to occur after close community consultation, including with veterans, stressing a need to be sensitive of the property\u2019s historical significance.",

Janie Barrett The orders inform staff that the public broadcaster is required to keep any document or record which could be relevant to the commission, including on social cohesion, antisemitism, religiously motivated extremism, radicalisation, law enforcement, border control, and the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attack. Last month, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a royal commission into the devastating attack of December 14, which left 15 people dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlbanese initially opposed a federal inquiry, arguing that a NSW-based inquiry would be sufficient, but backtracked after criticism from across the political spectrum. Former High Court judge Virginia Bell was hand-picked to be commissioner, with the probe set to conclude before December 14, 2026. The commission will investigate \u201cthe nature and prevalence of antisemitism in institutions and society... in Australia.\u201d Stevens told ABC employees that the message about keeping records was being sent \u201cto all news staff to ensure we don\u2019t inadvertently miss anyone, however, only some of you will have materials that are relevant.\u201d Stevens said that ABC staff were obliged to protect a range of material, including, documents, emails, text messages, social media posts, audio records, and datasets. He also warned staff about the use of timed disappearing messages on encrypted apps like Signal, which are frequently used by journalists to discuss sensitive material with sources. \u201cGoing forward, if you receive or send messages on Signal or any similar apps on these topics, continuing to use a disappearing messages setting would be a breach of the notice,\u201d Stevens said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you regularly delete emails for storage and security reasons we have to exclude emails on these topics from deletion until further notice.\u201d Related Article Bondi shooting Everything you need to know about the federal Bondi royal commission The ABC, along with other government agencies, were issued with a similar notice by the National Archives in 2020, relating to a federal inquiry into potential breaches of the law of war by Australian forces in Afghanistan. That notice remains in place. The ABC declined to comment. The National Archives was contacted for comment. An SBS spokesman said: \u201cSBS has only recently received this notice and we are still in the process of working through the implementation and impacts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current notice was issued by the National Archives\u2019 director-general Simon Froude this week, and applies to over 30 government agencies, including the ABC, SBS, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the eSafety Commissioner and the Attorney-General\u2019s Department. \u201cA disposal freeze is necessary to ensure that these records are protected and available when required,\u201d Froude said in a statement on the archives\u2019 website.

The S&P/ASX 200 was down 172.8 points, or 1.9 per cent, in lunchtime trade, with all 11 industry sectors in the red. Cryptocurrency markets plummeted overnight, with bitcoin falling below $US61,000 ($88,240) at one point. Wall Street was weighed down by Alphabet as AI concerns continue to leave investors uncertain. Bloomberg Mining stocks fell sharply with BHP shedding 2.7 per cent and Fortescue losing 1 per cent while Rio Tinto edged up 0.1 per cent after it was revealed it was walking away from merger talks with Glencore to create what would have been the world\u2019s biggest miner. Among gold stocks, Northern Star lost 2.2 per cent and Evolution Mining fell 2.9 per cent. Silver player South32 lost 4.5 per cent as the precious metals\u2019 markets continue to swing. Energy stocks dropped sharply, with oil prices falling by around 3 per cent after Iran confirmed it would hold negotiations with the US, easing the immediate risk of military conflict and supply disruptions from the OPEC producer. Woodside Energy lost 2 per cent and Santos retreated 1.7 per cent in early afternoon trade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnology stocks plummeted as concerns around the sector continue to reverberate on markets around the world.

It was trading at $US64,142 at 12.27pm AEDT. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the crypto market is now in full capitulation mode,\u201d said Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau. \u201cIf previous cycles are anything to go by, this is no longer a short-term correction, but rather a transition from distribution to reset - and these typically take months, not weeks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll told, the global crypto market has lost $US2 trillion in value since hitting a peak of $US4.379 trillion in early October, CoinGecko data showed, with some $US800 billion wiped out in the last month alone.

AP On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent for its sixth loss in the seven days since it set an all-time high. The Dow Jones dropped 592 points, or 1.2 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite sank 1.6 per cent. Qualcomm fell 8.5 per cent for one of the market\u2019s bigger losses even though the chip company topped analysts\u2019 expectations for profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields sank after a report said the number of US workers applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week by more than economists expected. That could be a signal that the pace of layoffs is accelerating. Some economists suggested last week\u2019s rise could be statistical noise, and the total number remains relatively low compared with history. But a separate report said that layoffs announced by US-based employers surged last month. The 108,435 was the highest number for a month since October, according to global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. For a January, it\u2019s the worst since 2009 during the Great Recession. A third report from the US government said that employers were advertising the lowest number of job openings in December in more than five years. The moves were even sharper in commodities markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSilver\u2019s price dropped 9.1 per cent in its latest wild swing since its record-breaking momentum suddenly halted last week. Gold\u2019s price fell 1.2 per cent to settle at $US4889.50 per ounce. It\u2019s been careening back and forth since roughly doubling in price over 12 months. It neared $US5600 last week and then fell below $US4500 on Monday. Alphabet dragged on the market and slipped 0.5 per cent, after paring an earlier loss of 8 per cent, even though the parent company of Google, YouTube and other businesses reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Investors focused instead on how much Alphabet is spending on artificial-intelligence technology and questioned whether it will all prove worth it. Alphabet said its spending on equipment and other investments could double this year to roughly $US180 billion ($260 billion). That blew past analysts\u2019 expectations of less than $US119 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the winning side of Wall Street were companies that stand to benefit from big spending by Alphabet and others continuing the AI frenzy.

Got it Share A A A\n\nOver the last six months, Mitch Brown has ticked off plenty of firsts. In August, he was the first AFL player (current or retired) to come out as bisexual. This week, his son Bowie attended his first day of school. And in three weeks time, Brown will attend his first Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, not just as a participant, but as co-host of the ABC\u2019s coverage of the parade. \u201cI just felt honoured, grateful, really excited,\u201d he says of being asked to participate in the broadcast. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to do a wide range of things, like genuine advocacy, working behind the scenes on Australian rules football \u2026 and this is another platform to continue a really important conversation, especially in my world \u2013 in hypermasculine sports around the country \u2013 on a national platform. I\u2019m just so bloody grateful.\u201d Mitch Brown is the first openly queer AFL player. He is set to be announced as one of the hosts of the ABC\u2019s Mardi Gras coverage. Justin McManus Brown, who played with the West Coast Eagles for 10 years, clocking up 94 senior games, made headlines last year when he came out as bisexual. In doing so, he became one of only a handful of male Australian athletes to come out as queer, joining NRL great Ian Roberts, NBL player Isaac Humphries, A-League star Josh Cavallo and Olympians Ian Thorpe and Matthew Mitcham.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy participating in the Mardi Gras coverage \u2013 where he will be joined by drag queen Courtney Act, ABC journalists Mon Schafter and Jeremy Fernandez, comedian Nath Valvo, former Bachelorette Brooke Blurton and chef Anna Polyviou \u2013 Brown says he wants to be a role model to other sportsmen who are hiding their sexuality. Related Article Good Weekend \u2018He was shaking\u2019: The encounter in his local cafe that hit home for Mitch Brown \u201cFor me, growing up, obviously, there\u2019s been no male role models that are queer in the professional AFL,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I had no one to really look to, even when I was hiding. When you can\u2019t speak to anyone, being able to at least look to someone, either on TV, listening to them, or even just scrolling on social media [that\u2019s really important]. \u201cBut people like Ian Roberts, I remember when he came out in the \u201990s, and then obviously Isaac Humphries, Josh Cavallo and Matthew Mitcham. So now I\u2019ve got these amazing role models around me, and I feel, although there is no one else in the Aussie Rules professional football scene [who is openly queer], to go in these queer spaces of celebration and see other people with this joy, and listen to their coming out stories, their experiences, and feel the weight off their shoulders ... When I came out in August last year, it wasn\u2019t for me. It was about changing those rigid stereotypes in Aussie rules football.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the night, Brown will march with the Sydney Swans, who have been participating in the parade since 2018, when they became the first professional sporting club to join the parade. In 2016, the NRL made history when it became the first code to feature a float, but was dumped in 2023, with organisers claiming they had no room because of high demand. In Melbourne, meanwhile, Essendon and Richmond participate in the Midsumma festival. It will be Brown\u2019s first Mardi Gras. He has previously attended Midsumma, although he was still closeted then. \u201cI love this time and these type of spaces and events, because for me, and for many people out there, once upon a time, my bisexuality embarrassed me. It was shame. It was the very thing I hated most about myself. And the opposite to that is pride and being proud of yourself. So this means more than just having fun and dancing.\u201d Connor Storrie as Ilya and Hudson Williams as Shane, professional rivals and secret lovers, in Heated Rivalry. As well as participating in the parade, the other thing Brown hopes the AFL will encourage clubs to do is watch the hit series Heated Rivalry, which is about the relationship between two gay ice hockey players. \u201cWe can have some great discussions, especially within AFL professional clubs, about that TV series and how it makes them feel,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWhy does it make them feel that way, whether it\u2019s really good or whether it\u2019s uncomfortable. I think they\u2019re really constructive, amazing conversations to have, which I\u2019ve challenged a few AFL clubs to do. More people have asked me, \u2018Should we do an AFL version of Heated Rivalry?\u2019 Definitely, I think 100 per cent, there\u2019s some really cool storylines there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for what he\u2019ll be wearing to Mardi Gras, the standard Aussie rules uniform is a good starting point. \u201cThat\u2019s what so many people around me keep saying,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThe AFL is so queer-coded anyway, with the short shorts and tight singlet. I mean, that\u2019s all you need.\u201d The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade will be broadcast live from 7.30pm on Saturday, February 28 on ABC TV and ABC iview.

Credit: Twitter \u201cHe was a really talented player, he was in Isaac\u2019s year and Tyler\u2019s year, they were pioneers really. That was really when the academy started. Recruiters were a bit sceptical of the academy and NSW kids, and that sort of stuff. Isaac was the stand-out in that year, Callum Mills the next year. \u201cBut when you said was it a surprise that he wasn\u2019t taken, given the status of the academy and NSW footy, and the penchant for Victorians, and South Australians and West Australians, not really because that was the landscape we were all part of in those formative years of the academy.\u201d\n\nDickson will have family and friends in California for the game on Monday (AEDT). But his father, Anthony, can\u2019t attend because he remains on parole for his involvement in one of Australia\u2019s biggest tax frauds. The former Ernst & Young executive was sentenced to 11 years in jail in 2015 \u2013 later increased to 14 on appeal \u2013 for two counts relating to a corporate tax fraud of $450 million of income through falsely created losses overseas. Loading Regardless, as he prepares to play before a global television audience expected to top 200 million, Dickson said his time at the Swans\u2019 academy was pivotal. \u201cIt [sporting journey] definitely started at the Swans academy. My time in Seattle has definitely flown by, but my time at the Swans\u2019 academy definitely prepared me for a lot of this stuff, moving over here, how to be a pro athlete, how to be a professional,\u201d he said. Chastened but not defeated, Dickson moved to Melbourne in 2015, and turned to ProKick Australia, a coaching program led by former AFL player Nathan Chapman that is designed to help aspiring kickers and punters play American football.\n\n\u201cI was hoping to go pro in Aussie rules football, I could see that wasn\u2019t [going to] happen, unless I went the mature-age route. I was going to take a year off footy, but in that year, it [became] \u2018let me see if I can give this American punting thing a crack\u2019,\u201d Dickson explained. Having learnt all he knew about the sport from films, including Remember the Titans, The Longest Yard and The Blind Side, Dickson\u2019s impressive kicking soon had him touring the University of Texas and claiming a scholarship with the fabled Longhorns. At Texas, his booming right leg earned him several awards, including All-American honours, and being named most valuable player of the Texas Bowl. Dickson said the sweet spot on a Sherrin \u201cwas definitely much bigger than an American football\u201d, and, initially, this had taken him time to adjust to.\n\nHe was so coveted by the Seahawks in the 2018 NFL draft they traded with Denver to move up the board to claim him. He has been with the franchise ever since, becoming the league\u2019s highest-paid punter after inking a four-year deal worth $US16.2 million ($23.4m) in June last year. Punting can be a lonely, fickle business, just ask fellow Australian Arryn Siposs, who, when with the Philadelphia Eagles, did not play again after his botched kick late in a loss to Kansas City in the 2023 Super Bowl. Dickson, however, is an established weapon. Chapman, the head punting coach at ProKick, said Dickson was one of Australia\u2019s elite sports stars, pointing out how remarkable it was that Dickson was in his eighth season with the Seahawks in a league where there is more churn than a stormy sea.\n\nHe said Dickson had been \u201cahead of the game\u201d in the variety of punts he offered, earning the tag among local media as the \u201ctrick-shot punter\u201d, through his punts, drop-kicks, spirals and banana-ball kicks. His high-hanging sky balls \u2013 he has regularly averaged an elite 48 yards (44 metres) \u2013 have been a stand-out. In 2021, he famously chased down a blocked snap and punted the ball a second time from behind the line of scrimmage; a rare move that led to a rule change regarding illegal kicks. Michael Dockson conducts interviews ahead of the biggest game of his NFL career - Monday\u2019s Super Bowl. Credit: AP \u201cHe works on his craft relentlessly. He has been with a team that has really backed him, and he has delivered for it,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a great story. He can do it all. There was probably a year or two where the league just said, \u2018kick it as far as you can\u2019, but I felt Dicko was always next-level on where the competition was at. When the majority were doing one thing, he was doing that, plus other stuff. His ability to be at the top level and do so many different kicks so well, when others kept it simple \u2013 spiral, high, to the right \u2013 he has been next level, and really looked like he has enjoyed it all the time.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how important variety was, Dickson said he was, \u201calways trying to experiment with new ways and get creative \u2026 to make it harder for the returner to catch\u201d. Loading Dickson played his role well in the NFC Championship game win over the LA Rams, with five punts for 226 yards. The two-time All-Pro selection said he was taking a low-key approach \u2013 as much as that is possible \u2013 to Monday\u2019s clash against the New England Patriots at Levi\u2019s Stadium in California, a rematch of 2015\u2019s epic championship battle. This includes his typical visualisation processes, down to the most minute detail of what to expect on game day. \u201cYou kind of try to not let it be too big for yourself. You do a lot of mental preparation. You do your routine that you have formulated over all these years. You try not to make it bigger than it is. That\u2019s the approach I am taking,\u201d Dickson said.",

    "text": "Today\u2019s conference, sponsored by the Herald, is aimed at politicians, planners, the corporate sector and academics and aims to articulate the big ideas that will make our lives better. Federal Minister for Cities Clare O\u2019Neil gave the keynote address this morning, in which she called on councils to accept sensible increases in housing density, saying urban sprawl is \u201cbaking inequality into the fabric of Sydney\u201d. Earlier, in a chat with incoming Herald editor Jordan Baker, NSW Minister for Planning and Public Spaces Paul Scully acknowledged the state is falling short of where it hoped to be in meeting national housing targets.\n\nThanks to a survey presented at the summit , we know that cost-of-living pressures and housing affordability are overwhelmingly identified as the biggest problems facing Sydneysiders. Behind these two concerns lurk the ongoing negative effects of climate change. So how can we climate-proof Sydney, increase housing affordability, and make sure our urban spaces are liveable and fun while also moving to higher-density living?\n\nOne of the criticisms that news journalism faces is that we focus too much on the negative \u2013 a lot of our coverage revolves around a miasma of disputes, disruptions, disasters, delays and discord. It\u2019s true that our news values elevate conflict over concept because we know that conflict and negative consequence is a surefire way to get readers\u2019 attention. But that is not all we do. It has been exciting to be involved over the past months with the Sydney Summit , a one-day conference hosted by the Committee for Sydney that looks at how we live and work and tries to imagine how our great city can be improved for future generations.\n\nThe second session will include former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and new state Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane.\n\nIn a series of articles in the lead up, we have written about:\n\nIt\u2019s exciting to be involved with passionate civic leaders working together to plan for a brighter tomorrow. To keep up with all the key events today, follow our live blog. Speaking of big ideas, I think my favourite column of the week came from Matt Wade.\n\nWhile most of us agree cost of living is our biggest concern, Matt looked at the data \u2013 which tells a slightly different story to our perception. While there is a small percentage of Australians who are really doing it tough \u2013 and are genuinely deserving of more government help \u2013 most of us are not significantly worse off than a few years ago, and many of us are, in fact, better off. Matt\u2019s thesis goes against the populist narrative (that I confess I get swept up in) and argues powerfully and logically that our obsession with the cost-of-living crisis, happily pandered to by politicians, is actually leading to bad policy and political priorities. I hope our politicians, federal and state, read this and take note. Read his piece here. My other favourite article this week was a beautifully tender piece of writing from Jacqueline Maley to farewell the much admired former governor of NSW Marie Bashir. Jacqueline is a class act and brings an intelligence and warmth to her writing that always elevates her prose above the rest. Her description of Phillip Street coming to a halt as the funeral procession passed was both sombre but also unexpectedly uplifting. Read her piece here.

    "text": "They say the grass isn't always greener on the other side \u2014 but on Victoria Parade in Melbourne's inner city, it quite literally is.\n\nA tram line runs down the centre of Victoria Parade. On one side of the tracks, in East Melbourne, the grass is green and neatly managed by the City of Melbourne, one of Victoria's wealthiest councils.\n\nOn the other side, in Fitzroy, the median strip is dry, overgrown and unmowed.\n\nThat strip has become the centre of a growing dispute between local and state government over who is responsible for maintaining the road \u2014 and a fresh flashpoint in broader criticism of the Victorian Labor government, led by Premier Jacinta Allan.\n\nDivided road, divided responsibilities\n\nWhile Victoria Parade and its median strip are state-managed assets, the City of Yarra \u2014 which the road runs through \u2014 has refused to continue footing the bill for maintenance, arguing the responsibility sits squarely with the state government.\n\nCity of Yarra mayor Stephen Jolly has likened the stalemate to a geopolitical stand-off.\n\n\"Either we give in and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of ratepayers' money doing Jacinta Allan's job or we keep pressuring them to actually do their job,\" Jolly told radio station 3AW recently.\n\nThe City of Yarra has refused to mow a median strip on a major Melbourne arterial road, saying it's \"being bled\" by the state government not maintaining assets it is responsible for. Source: SBS News\n\nAs a form of protest, the City of Yarra stopped mowing the Victoria Parade median strip, saying it has not received additional funding to cover the work.\n\n\"It is embarrassing. It's like North and South Korea kind of thing. That's where we are at the moment.\"\n\nJolly has argued the dispute is part of a broader pattern of \"cost shifting\" from the state government, which he says is costing local councils close to $24 million.\n\nOpposition seizes on grass dispute\n\nVictorian Opposition leader Jess Wilson has seized on the dispute, releasing a social media video on the weekend showing Opposition MPs mowing part of the median strip.\n\n\"This is the grass the Labor Government can't afford to mow,\" Wilson says in the video. \"It seems Jacinta Allan can't do her job, so we're here to do it for her.\"\n\nThe video shows several members of the Opposition wearing high-visibility vests and protective eyewear, claiming the job took \"only thirty minutes\".\n\nWhen SBS News visited Victoria Parade on Monday, it appeared a small section of the median strip had been mowed.\n\nAsked about the issue at a press conference on Monday, Transport and Infrastructure Minister Gabrielle Williams said the Opposition's weekend grass cutting was a \"stunt\".\n\n\"I think it\u2019s fair to say the Liberal party is embracing stunts as they head into an election year,\" Williams said. \"It is a slight sidestep from their usual practice of fighting with each other either through the courts or through the media.\"\n\nSBS News has contacted Premier Jacinta Allan's office for comment.\n\nCost-shifting a 'major concern'\n\nCost-shifting refers to situations where one level of government transfers responsibility for services or infrastructure to another \u2014 often without providing enough funding to cover the cost.\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA) said it was an issue of \"major concern for councils\".\n\n\"Every new Commonwealth policy or strategy has cost implications for other levels of government \u2014 most of which local governments aren\u2019t compensated for,\" ALGA told SBS News.\n\nIt says the practice is challenging the long-term financial sustainability of councils in Australia.\n\n\"Cost-shifting is having a real effect on communities across Australia. Every service shifted to local government without compensation reduces the services the council can provide.\"\n\nLocal Government NSW's latest cost-shifting report revealed a total cost shift to councils of $1.36 billion in 2021-22, equivalent to more than $460 per ratepayer annually.\n\nIn Queensland, that figure amounted to $360 million in 2021-22 \u2014 a 378 per cent increase from $47 million in 2002.\n\n\"The impact of this cost-shifting isn\u2019t academic. Cuts to councils are cuts to community liveability,\" the ALGA said.\n\n\"Every service shifted to local government means that people miss out because funding, policies and legislation from federal and state governments haven't kept pace with the needs of every local community.\"\n\n'Being bled', says local council\n\nThe City of Yarra has pointed to other major arterial roads within its boundaries \u2014 including Bridge Rd, Alexandra Pde, Burnley St and Hoddle St \u2014 which it says also require maintenance from the state government.\n\nThat last one was mowed last week \"at last\" by the state government, Jolly said.\n\nJolly has also said the council has been forced to pick up responsibility for services such as school crossing supervision and needle collection near a safe injecting room \u2014 tasks he argues should be funded by the state.\n\n\"We're being bled,\" he said.\n\nIn late 2023, the City of Yarra stopped monthly maintenance on state-managed roads after receiving $88,000 from the state government for work it says costs more than $1 million a year, according to The Age newspaper.\n\nThe City of Melbourne maintains its side of the median strip under an agreement with VicRoads and the Department of Transport and Planning.\n\nA spokesperson for the City of Yarra told SBS News that the City of Melbourne has a revenue and budget surplus \"three times the size of ours\".\n\nAcross Victoria, responsibility for road maintenance is split between different levels of government. The Department of Transport and Planning manages about 11 per cent of the road network, largely freeways and major arterial roads, while the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action and Parks Victoria are responsible for a further 28 per cent, mostly roads through parks and forests.\n\nLocal councils manage around 60 per cent, primarily local roads.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nGlobal democracy has wound back to 1985 levels - that's the latest assessment by Human Rights Watch in their annual report.\n\nThe United States, China and Russia are named almost instantly in the Executive Director's opening chapter, cited as threats to the rules-based international order.\n\nPhilippe Bolopion says the global human rights system is in peril.\n\n\u201cIn the world for the last 20 years, democracy has been receding steadily. And every time democracy recedes, it's bad for human rights, it's bad for the full range of human rights. So we've had like, you know, an adverse environment, I would say, for the last 20 years with, you know, many countries becoming less free.\u201d\n\nThe United States takes the focus.\n\nThe very opening chapter of the report is titled 'Will Human Rights Survive a Trumpian World?'\n\n\u201cIt's actually incredible to see how the Trump administration has really undermined all the pillars of U.S. democracy, all the checks and balances on power. These days still, you know, sort of undermining the trust in elections, the sanctity of elections, going after the judiciary and judges going after journalists.\u201d\n\nThese issues are only part of a long list of deficiencies outlined in the report, which also includes the United States' destruction of food assistance and healthcare subsidies, women's rights, and programs to support non-white people, people with disability, and trans people.\n\nMr Bolopion also cites the erosion of privacy, and the use of government power to intimidate political opponents, the media, law firms, universities, civil society, and even comedians.\n\nIt's 'Trump's new world disorder', the report says, where 'might makes right and atrocities are not dealbreakers'.\n\nAshkaya Kumar is the director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch, and says while no country has a perfect record, these issues signal a huge reversal of the United States' traditional role in upholding the broader multilateral order.\n\n\u201cWhat we've seen in the past 12 months is a US government that's not just stepped away from that role, but what we point out is new hostility to the very idea of international law as a constraint US President Donald Trump has said his morality is the only constraint he feels necessary and deep scepticism for the multilateral order. The US has quit 66 international organizations. It is refusing to pay its UN dues, which is actually required to be a part of the UN by law. And so it is also sanctioning judges of the international criminal court in the Hague. And these steps are of a different caliber than anything we've seen from an American administration in the past.\u201d\n\nBut China and Russia also play a significant role.\n\nThese global powers are cited as being less free today than 20 years ago, while the report also notes democracy is receding in India.\n\nMs Kumar says the United States is actually adopting some of these powers' authoritarian policies, referencing Chinese use of Interpol red notices to pursue dissidents and Russian attempts to block multilateral statements that might refer to gender.\n\n\u201cThese are all a playbook that other middle power authoritarian countries have also enabled. And now we're seeing the US joining that fray. So recently at the United Nations, we've seen the US coming out and saying, we can't accept any language on gender. This is something that we previously would have expected more to be a Russian objection. We also are very aware of the broader campaign misinformation and disinformation that has been tied to state-owned entities, enterprises in China and Russia. And I think that the tech angle to the broader transnational repression that we've seen from these two governments is certainly worth scrutinising.\u201d\n\nBut it's not just these global powers being spotlit.\n\nAustralia is also condemned for its failures to protect the rights of asylum seekers and refugees, among a number of other issues.\n\nThe United Nations has already condemned the Australian government's lack of transparency around its immigration detention policy and practices, and following a visit at the end of last year they said Australia's mandatory detention regime violated international human rights.\n\nAnnabel Hennessy is Australian Researcher for Human Rights Watch and says the organisation has been disappointed to see the failure of the Australian government to respond to UN findings.\n\n\u201cAnd instead, what we saw later on in the year was it expand its abusive policies via the announcement of the new deal with Nauru, which could potentially see hundreds of people deported to Nauru once again. And also what's particularly concerning about those laws is the fact that when they were passed, they also passed new laws to deny the right of asylum seekers or other people being forcibly transferred to Nauru the right to fair process.\u201d\n\nThe Minister for Home Affairs was contacted for comment.\n\nAustralia is also criticised for its youth detention policies, including its law enabling the age of criminal responsibility to start from 10 years old, below the United Nations standard.\n\nFailure to protect First Nations Australians is also noted, including the much higher rates of child removal for First Nations people.\n\nRacism is also tainting Australia's record, with the report highlighting the Bondi terror attack which killed 15 people in December last year.\n\nMs Hennessy says the solution isn't simple but preventative policies are key, criticising gaps in the government's recent hate speech laws established in response to the terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cSo under the laws, groups aren't given a right to procedural fairness. So this means that there's no evidential standards of what's required for a hate crime, what's required for a group to be listed, and also that the groups don't get an opportunity to respond. Our concern there is that if groups get listed who are not inciting violence or there's not evidence that they're inciting violence, and we don't want Australia to follow the ranks of other governments where they have listed peaceful civic groups as hate groups or as terrorist groups.\u201d\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest barriers to enforcing human rights protections is Australia's absence of a human rights act - the only western democracy without one.\n\n\u201cWhat it would do as well is ensure that what is written into our domestic laws is what Australia has already signed up for in regards to the various treaties it's already a party to because what various government inquiries have found is currently we have patchwork protections, and even in the case of refugees, the Australian government has actually removed references to the Refugee Convention in our Migration Act.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch says protection for vulnerable people, including asylum seekers, has never been more important - as the world confronts conflicts across multiple regions.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza captured global attention and condemnation, as countries signed joint statements heavily criticising the use of starvation as a weapon of war and the killing of innocent civilians.\n\nThe organisation describes Israel's war on Gaza as a genocide - allegations Israel continues to reject.\n\nMs Kumar says one of the most insidious aspects of the conflict is support and provision of weapons to Israel from countries including the US, UK and Germany - eroding norms that are supposed to prevent weapons from being sold to actors who violate the laws of war.\n\n\u201cAnd that is a bigger problem for all of us because it requires them to either make the argument that Israel is not violating the laws of war, which stretches credulity and asks us to ignore the facts that all of us are aware of. Or it requires us to accept some kind of Israel exception where the law will be applied to a place like South Sudan or the Central African Republic, but not to an actor like Israel. And neither is good for the rules based international order.\u201d\n\nThat's why, Ms Kumar says, countries that value human rights have a vital role to play in holding other actors to account.\n\n\u201cA country like Australia, for example, has reserved its judgment. So it said, oh, we would leave it to the US to identify the legal basis for their actions. And that's just not how we see Australia even deal with human rights situations in other places. For example, if the Malaysian government was involved in an extrajudicial killing, I think that we would see the Australian government doing that fact and law analysis itself. And so I think central to any effective campaign to rejuvenate the broader global human rights movement and safeguard the architecture is a commitment to equal application of the law to all actors.\u201d\n\n+++\n\nSince publication SBS has received a response from the Home Affairs Department. Among other things it says: \"The arrangement with Nauru is compliant with Australian\u2019s international obligations. The Australian Government is committed to maintaining a migration system that is robust, effective and in the national interest.\"",

I have to pay for the specialised surgeon, the anaesthetist, hospital costs, out of pocket expenses, then medication.\"\n\nJackie is not alone in feeling the weight of a cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe public healthcare system covers a range of care for cancer patients.\n\nBut McCabe Centre director Hayley Jones says the Cancer Council of Australia's new research shows 99 percent of those diagnosed with cancer face significant out of pocket expenses, even if they're accessing public treatment services.\n\n\"This can include both direct costs - such as the cost of surgical treatment and medications - as well as indirect costs, which include loss of income that they experience due to missing out on working.\"\n\nThe Cancer Council analysis has found that loss of income or disruption to employment is the most common financial cost, affecting more than one-third of Australians diagnosed with cancer.\n\nAnd Hayley Jones says to make matters worse, this loss of income is not always temporary.\n\n\"The results of their treatment, even if they are cured from their cancer - given that we have such great survivorship rates now in Australia - it may mean that they are living for a much longer time, but it might mean they are living with other health effects that prevent them from returning to work.\"\n\nBill Stavreski from the Leukaemia Foundation says blood cancer - the kind that Jackie was diagnosed with - is among the most expensive.\n\n\"On average, each family - each patient - is out of pocket close to $8000... It doesn't mean that every patient and family will experience that. But for some - and one in 10 - they experience out of pocket expenses of more than $20,000.\"\n\nOne of the factors that typically makes cancer treatment even more costly is the patient's distance from treatment centres.\n\nThe picture gets even worse for First Nations communities who the Foundation says face substantial barriers to treatment and care compared to non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nThe Leukaemia Foundation has released its own study showing three in every four Indigenous Australians diagnosed with blood cancer during the survey period lived in rural or regional Australia.\n\nBill Stavreski says the lack of options close by leaves many with little choice but to travel sometimes thousands of kilometres away - by themselves, away from their support networks.\n\n\"Treatment for blood cancer generally will last weeks, if not months. So that means being on your own - potentially maybe a family member. But it also means looking for accommodation. And we know that accommodation - and transport - is quite expensive.\"\n\nThe Foundation's study paints an even more dire picture, finding First Nations patients are dying at a rate that's five times higher than the rest of the population.\n\n\"There was minimal information out there, and the commissioning of this research was really to focus on how dire the situation is. We knew it was relatively dire; we didn't know how severe it was.\"\n\nAdvocates like Bill and Hayley are calling for government action, seeing the prevalence of cancer and the cost of dealing with it as a national public health and equity issue.\n\nMs Jones says financial counselling is one option that could help patients and their families, but there are also other practical measures to consider.\n\n\"We think all Australians undergoing cancer treatment should be connected to financial support early so that they can receive the best cancer care without fear of the financial impact... Ensuring that people have access to enough leave when they're dealing with cancer, which is often a condition that changes over time. People can use up a lot of their leave quite quickly... The other issue that we're very conscious of is that employment law - annual leave entitlements - only apply to people with a permanent job. There are a lot of people in casual work or the gig economy who don't have those protections.\"\n\nMr Stavreski says it's an especially urgent situation because of the rising rates of cancer in Australia.\n\n\"It's the third most common cancer in Australia... Blood cancer has increased by close to 70 percent over the last two decades. Back in 2006 it was close to 10,500 Australians were diagnosed. Last year, more than 20,000.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jackie Henderson still considers herself one of the lucky ones, because she's had the support of her husband in attending appointments and undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\n\nShe has a message for others daunted by the prospect of dealing with cancer themselves.\n\n\"If they feel there's changes in their body - for whatever reason - don't stall. Go and get it checked.\"",

    "text": "Thank you for reading our live coverage of the 2026 Sydney Summit, hosted by the Committee for Sydney think tank and supported by the Herald. A team of reporters is on the ground at ICC Sydney to bring you the latest as the summit continues this afternoon.\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s summit is \u201cthe bold city\u201d.\n\nThere is a packed roster of talent speaking at the 2026 Sydney Summit. Staff photographers\n\nSo far, we have heard from NSW Planning Minister Paul Scully, arguing that \u201cgovernment systems have become so riddled with a culture of no, that they have become anything but bold\u201d. Scully singled out opposition to development as a major obstacle to economic and housing growth, admitting NSW was \u201cbehind where [it] wanted to be\u201d on its housing targets.\n\nIt was a similar sentiment from federal Housing Minister Clare O\u2019Neil, who criticised the uneven way in which housing was being introduced in Sydney, with well resourced councils knocking back \u201csensible\u201d increases in density while those further afield picked up the slack, despite lacking necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe State of the City report by the Committee for Sydney and BDO, presented at today\u2019s summit, identified Parramatta, Liverpool and Bankstown as among the city\u2019s most overcrowded centres.\n\nNSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane reiterated that she was \u201cpro-housing\u201d, including in her own eastern suburbs electorate, but cautioned against throwing \u201cslings and arrows\u201d at the east, when there were 4500 people per square kilometre in Woollahra, compared to 3300 in Parramatta.\n\nThe Herald\u2019s incoming editor, Jordan Baker, asked both Scully and Sloane whether the state government should move to acquire defence sites this week identified by a federal audit as suitable for sale, including Victoria Barracks and the HMAS Penguin.\n\nScully confirmed Homes NSW had made inquiries about \u201cpotential options\u201d for Victoria Barracks, but ruled out aggressive redevelopment, such as \u201cgoing in and bulldozing it and replacing it with huge apartment towers\u201d. Sloane raised concerns about \u201cthe federal government offloading assets onto state governments without a clear plan\u201d, while both politicians said any development of the site would need to occur after close community consultation, including with veterans, stressing a need to be sensitive of the property\u2019s historical significance.",

Last month, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a royal commission into the devastating attack of December 14, which left 15 people dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlbanese initially opposed a federal inquiry, arguing that a NSW-based inquiry would be sufficient, but backtracked after criticism from across the political spectrum.

He also warned staff about the use of timed disappearing messages on encrypted apps like Signal, which are frequently used by journalists to discuss sensitive material with sources. \u201cGoing forward, if you receive or send messages on Signal or any similar apps on these topics, continuing to use a disappearing messages setting would be a breach of the notice,\u201d Stevens said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you regularly delete emails for storage and security reasons we have to exclude emails on these topics from deletion until further notice.\u201d Related Article Bondi shooting Everything you need to know about the federal Bondi royal commission The ABC, along with other government agencies, were issued with a similar notice by the National Archives in 2020, relating to a federal inquiry into potential breaches of the law of war by Australian forces in Afghanistan.

The S&P/ASX 200 was down 172.8 points, or 1.9 per cent, in lunchtime trade, with all 11 industry sectors in the red. Cryptocurrency markets plummeted overnight, with bitcoin falling below $US61,000 ($88,240) at one point. Wall Street was weighed down by Alphabet as AI concerns continue to leave investors uncertain.

This week, his son Bowie attended his first day of school. And in three weeks time, Brown will attend his first Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, not just as a participant, but as co-host of the ABC\u2019s coverage of the parade. \u201cI just felt honoured, grateful, really excited,\u201d he says of being asked to participate in the broadcast. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to do a wide range of things, like genuine advocacy, working behind the scenes on Australian rules football \u2026 and this is another platform to continue a really important conversation, especially in my world \u2013 in hypermasculine sports around the country \u2013 on a national platform. I\u2019m just so bloody grateful.\u201d Mitch Brown is the first openly queer AFL player. He is set to be announced as one of the hosts of the ABC\u2019s Mardi Gras coverage. Justin McManus Brown, who played with the West Coast Eagles for 10 years, clocking up 94 senior games, made headlines last year when he came out as bisexual. In doing so, he became one of only a handful of male Australian athletes to come out as queer, joining NRL great Ian Roberts, NBL player Isaac Humphries, A-League star Josh Cavallo and Olympians Ian Thorpe and Matthew Mitcham.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy participating in the Mardi Gras coverage \u2013 where he will be joined by drag queen Courtney Act, ABC journalists Mon Schafter and Jeremy Fernandez, comedian Nath Valvo, former Bachelorette Brooke Blurton and chef Anna Polyviou \u2013 Brown says he wants to be a role model to other sportsmen who are hiding their sexuality. Related Article Good Weekend \u2018He was shaking\u2019: The encounter in his local cafe that hit home for Mitch Brown \u201cFor me, growing up, obviously, there\u2019s been no male role models that are queer in the professional AFL,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I had no one to really look to, even when I was hiding. When you can\u2019t speak to anyone, being able to at least look to someone, either on TV, listening to them, or even just scrolling on social media [that\u2019s really important]. \u201cBut people like Ian Roberts, I remember when he came out in the \u201990s, and then obviously Isaac Humphries, Josh Cavallo and Matthew Mitcham. So now I\u2019ve got these amazing role models around me, and I feel, although there is no one else in the Aussie Rules professional football scene [who is openly queer], to go in these queer spaces of celebration and see other people with this joy, and listen to their coming out stories, their experiences, and feel the weight off their shoulders ... When I came out in August last year, it wasn\u2019t for me. It was about changing those rigid stereotypes in Aussie rules football.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the night, Brown will march with the Sydney Swans, who have been participating in the parade since 2018, when they became the first professional sporting club to join the parade. In 2016, the NRL made history when it became the first code to feature a float, but was dumped in 2023, with organisers claiming they had no room because of high demand. In Melbourne, meanwhile, Essendon and Richmond participate in the Midsumma festival. It will be Brown\u2019s first Mardi Gras. He has previously attended Midsumma, although he was still closeted then. \u201cI love this time and these type of spaces and events, because for me, and for many people out there, once upon a time, my bisexuality embarrassed me. It was shame. It was the very thing I hated most about myself. And the opposite to that is pride and being proud of yourself. So this means more than just having fun and dancing.\u201d Connor Storrie as Ilya and Hudson Williams as Shane, professional rivals and secret lovers, in Heated Rivalry. As well as participating in the parade, the other thing Brown hopes the AFL will encourage clubs to do is watch the hit series Heated Rivalry, which is about the relationship between two gay ice hockey players. \u201cWe can have some great discussions, especially within AFL professional clubs, about that TV series and how it makes them feel,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWhy does it make them feel that way, whether it\u2019s really good or whether it\u2019s uncomfortable. I think they\u2019re really constructive, amazing conversations to have, which I\u2019ve challenged a few AFL clubs to do. More people have asked me, \u2018Should we do an AFL version of Heated Rivalry?\u2019 Definitely, I think 100 per cent, there\u2019s some really cool storylines there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for what he\u2019ll be wearing to Mardi Gras, the standard Aussie rules uniform is a good starting point. \u201cThat\u2019s what so many people around me keep saying,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThe AFL is so queer-coded anyway, with the short shorts and tight singlet. I mean, that\u2019s all you need.\u201d The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade will be broadcast live from 7.30pm on Saturday, February 28 on ABC TV and ABC iview.

This year, with the annual Day of Love falling on a Saturday, there\u2019s time to do more than just a dinner out. You could book brunch or lunch, pick-up a special treat, plan a picnic or prepare a special meal at home. Here are six ways to celebrate beyond the usual dinner reservation. Humble\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day range. Caroline McCredie Pick up a pastry Where words fail, pastries rarely do. This year, Sydney bakeries are embracing Saint Valentine\u2019s Day with a host of special treats. For a sweet surprise on the day, Humble in Surry Hills has iced vovo finger buns (three for $24) and heart-shaped shortbread cookies ($15), while Lucien Baked Goods in Parramatta is selling a Persian love cake, topped with pistachio praline and rose petals. If you\u2019re happy to plan ahead, several bakeries are taking pre-orders. Loulou Boulangerie & Traiteur in Milson\u2019s Point is making a tarte de l\u2019amour ($11), on a butter biscuit base topped with mascarpone and berries. Shadow Baking in Marrickville and Darlinghurst has created a special Valentine\u2019s Day tart ($42) made from croissant pastry filled with white chocolate chantilly, freeze-dried raspberries and rose petals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlan a picnic Restaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox. Sign up A good picnic is mostly about knowing where to shop. Simon Johnson\u2019s Alexandria outlet is the spot for specialty cheese on sale, with well priced wedges ripe and ready to enjoy on the day. Its Woollahra boutique is also running a February special on Oscietra Gold caviar with 20 per cent off across the range ($119.20 for a 30g tin). Pa\u0302te\u0301 en croute from Loulou Boulangerie & Traiteur For a grab-and-go option, Continental Deli in Newtown offers charcuterie boxes filled with cheese, cured meals, crispbread and pickles \u2013 perfect for a picnic at nearby Camperdown Park. Loulou Boulangerie & Traiteur, a short walk from Lavender Bay, stocks p\u00e2t\u00e9, rillettes, cheese and salami, alongside freshly baked baguette and lavash to pair with it. Choose your own selection or pre-order a hamper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinental Deli\u2019s charcuterie plate is available to take away. Hollie Adams Norma\u2019s Deli in Manly offers heartier picnic fare, from Roman pizza slices and focaccia sandwiches to spanakopita ($45 half, $85 whole) and lemon-and-rosemary-rotisserie chicken ($14 half, $28 whole) with salads, available to pre-order online. Don\u2019t forget the wine Sparkling ros\u00e9 is the right colour for Valentine\u2019s Day, and it\u2019s also the perfect match for picnic foods like taramasalata, fresh prawns and strawberry desserts. Good Food\u2019s national drinks writer Katie Spain believes the best pink bubbles come from Tasmania, calling A by Arras Premium Cuvee Ros\u00e9 \u201castoundingly good value\u201d at $39 a bottle. Here are four more she recommends, all under $100. Theeca serves one giant pancake. Steven Siewert\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHead out for brunch or lunch Love doesn\u2019t wait, unless it\u2019s for a table at Bills. Start the day with pancakes at Sydney\u2019s best spots, or line up at an occasion-worthy cafe such as Bills in Surry Hills, which serves yellow peach and jasmine flower bellinis from 7am. Cafe Margaret in Double Bay serves mimosas from 10am, while Cafe Cressida in Paddington has a strawberry bellini from 10am. Some of Sydney\u2019s best restaurants have opened up additional lunch sittings. Infinity by Mark Best, the city\u2019s revolving restaurant, is fully booked in the evening, but still has a few tables left for lunch. Sydney restaurant Eleven Barrack will have a pianist playing on Valentine\u2019s Day. Jennifer Soo Eleven Barrack will also open its doors during the day for a special Valentine\u2019s Day menu of prawn ravioli and strawberry mille-feuille. In Gymea, Fior will open for their usual lunch service with the special addition of a pink tiramisu, made with ros\u00e9 and ruby chocolate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Liaw\u2019s marinara seafood pasta. Cook something You can also just skip the Valentine\u2019s Day mark-up, and make a special meal at home. Seafood pasta is a favourite for the occasion: it\u2019s impressive, but more importantly, it\u2019s easy. Adam Liaw\u2019s seafood marinara marries prawns, calamari and tomatoes in a garlicky wine-based white sauce. Gnocchi is another option \u2013 Jessica Brook\u2019s version combines mushroom and pancetta in a creamy, cheesy sauce.

    "text": "Dickson was overlooked in the 2014 AFL national draft, Roos suggesting recruiters were still sceptical about the talent in NSW outside Heeney, who was destined to become a superstar. \u201cHe was talented. Probably the thing that hurt him was we had to play him full-back, centre half-back \u2013 [even though] he was a bit undersized. That didn\u2019t help him,\u201d Roos said. Australian punter Michael Dickson has been a mainstay with the Seahawks. Credit: Twitter \u201cHe was a really talented player, he was in Isaac\u2019s year and Tyler\u2019s year, they were pioneers really. That was really when the academy started. Recruiters were a bit sceptical of the academy and NSW kids, and that sort of stuff. Isaac was the stand-out in that year, Callum Mills the next year. \u201cBut when you said was it a surprise that he wasn\u2019t taken, given the status of the academy and NSW footy, and the penchant for Victorians, and South Australians and West Australians, not really because that was the landscape we were all part of in those formative years of the academy.\u201d\n\nDickson will have family and friends in California for the game on Monday (AEDT). But his father, Anthony, can\u2019t attend because he remains on parole for his involvement in one of Australia\u2019s biggest tax frauds. The former Ernst & Young executive was sentenced to 11 years in jail in 2015 \u2013 later increased to 14 on appeal \u2013 for two counts relating to a corporate tax fraud of $450 million of income through falsely created losses overseas. Loading Regardless, as he prepares to play before a global television audience expected to top 200 million, Dickson said his time at the Swans\u2019 academy was pivotal. \u201cIt [sporting journey] definitely started at the Swans academy. My time in Seattle has definitely flown by, but my time at the Swans\u2019 academy definitely prepared me for a lot of this stuff, moving over here, how to be a pro athlete, how to be a professional,\u201d he said. Chastened but not defeated, Dickson moved to Melbourne in 2015, and turned to ProKick Australia, a coaching program led by former AFL player Nathan Chapman that is designed to help aspiring kickers and punters play American football.\n\n\u201cI was hoping to go pro in Aussie rules football, I could see that wasn\u2019t [going to] happen, unless I went the mature-age route. I was going to take a year off footy, but in that year, it [became] \u2018let me see if I can give this American punting thing a crack\u2019,\u201d Dickson explained. Having learnt all he knew about the sport from films, including Remember the Titans, The Longest Yard and The Blind Side, Dickson\u2019s impressive kicking soon had him touring the University of Texas and claiming a scholarship with the fabled Longhorns. At Texas, his booming right leg earned him several awards, including All-American honours, and being named most valuable player of the Texas Bowl. Dickson said the sweet spot on a Sherrin \u201cwas definitely much bigger than an American football\u201d, and, initially, this had taken him time to adjust to.\n\nHe was so coveted by the Seahawks in the 2018 NFL draft they traded with Denver to move up the board to claim him. He has been with the franchise ever since, becoming the league\u2019s highest-paid punter after inking a four-year deal worth $US16.2 million ($23.4m) in June last year. Punting can be a lonely, fickle business, just ask fellow Australian Arryn Siposs, who, when with the Philadelphia Eagles, did not play again after his botched kick late in a loss to Kansas City in the 2023 Super Bowl. Dickson, however, is an established weapon. Chapman, the head punting coach at ProKick, said Dickson was one of Australia\u2019s elite sports stars, pointing out how remarkable it was that Dickson was in his eighth season with the Seahawks in a league where there is more churn than a stormy sea.\n\nHe said Dickson had been \u201cahead of the game\u201d in the variety of punts he offered, earning the tag among local media as the \u201ctrick-shot punter\u201d, through his punts, drop-kicks, spirals and banana-ball kicks. His high-hanging sky balls \u2013 he has regularly averaged an elite 48 yards (44 metres) \u2013 have been a stand-out. In 2021, he famously chased down a blocked snap and punted the ball a second time from behind the line of scrimmage; a rare move that led to a rule change regarding illegal kicks. Michael Dockson conducts interviews ahead of the biggest game of his NFL career - Monday\u2019s Super Bowl. Credit: AP \u201cHe works on his craft relentlessly. He has been with a team that has really backed him, and he has delivered for it,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a great story. He can do it all. There was probably a year or two where the league just said, \u2018kick it as far as you can\u2019, but I felt Dicko was always next-level on where the competition was at. When the majority were doing one thing, he was doing that, plus other stuff. His ability to be at the top level and do so many different kicks so well, when others kept it simple \u2013 spiral, high, to the right \u2013 he has been next level, and really looked like he has enjoyed it all the time.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how important variety was, Dickson said he was, \u201calways trying to experiment with new ways and get creative \u2026 to make it harder for the returner to catch\u201d. Loading Dickson played his role well in the NFC Championship game win over the LA Rams, with five punts for 226 yards. The two-time All-Pro selection said he was taking a low-key approach \u2013 as much as that is possible \u2013 to Monday\u2019s clash against the New England Patriots at Levi\u2019s Stadium in California, a rematch of 2015\u2019s epic championship battle. This includes his typical visualisation processes, down to the most minute detail of what to expect on game day. \u201cYou kind of try to not let it be too big for yourself. You do a lot of mental preparation. You do your routine that you have formulated over all these years. You try not to make it bigger than it is. That\u2019s the approach I am taking,\u201d Dickson said.",

It was a different world to the one in which the 33-year-old Australian now lives in, as she heads to Milano Cortina as one of the favourites to become Olympic champion in the monobob \u2013 the female-only solo bobsled event. \u201cThere was no way I could foresee what I have now achieved,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there was a part of me that knew I could be successful in this sport. It was just finding a way to make it happen.\u201d Monobob athlete Bree Walker takes a photo with other members of Australia\u2019s 2026 Olympic team. Credit: Getty Images for AOC Walker spoke to this masthead from Calgary, Canada in October \u2013 just before heading to Europe for the World Cup season. In the three months since, Walker has dominated the circuit, winning three world cup gold medals, a silver and a bronze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics will be her second, after debuting for Australia at Beijing in 2022 where she finished 5th overall in the monobob and 16th in two-woman bobsleigh. Milano Cortina will also mark a decade since Walker, a former track and field athlete, declared her grand plan to become a Winter Olympian. \u201cMy own mum was like, \u2018Are you sure you want to do this?\u2019\u201d recalls Walker. \u201cI was the kid who always had crazy ideas ... but I think this was a little bit of a shocker to them. They were like, \u2018This? This is what you\u2019re going to choose to do now?\u2019\u201d For Australian athletes, the cost of competing internationally is often higher due to travel, accommodation and equipment. Even more so when you\u2019re competing in a sport that only exists in the northern hemisphere, in which a two-person sled costs about $110,000 and a single sled $42,000. But against the odds, with one of the smallest teams in the game, Walker arrives in Italy with a podium finish within her grasp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team behind Bobsled Bree Walker left Beijing in 2022 wanting more. She knew she was capable of mixing it with the best, but needed the right coach to get her there. Enter Pierre Lueders, or, as Walker describes him, the \u201cTom Cruise of the bobsleigh world\u201d. Lueders was Olympic champion in the two-man bobsled at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano and a silver medallist in Turin in 2006, before coaching the Russian, South Korean and Chinese teams to Olympic success between 2011 and 2022. He was the best in the business, and the guy Walker \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 wanted as her private coach for the Milano Cortina Olympic cycle. \u201cAfter Beijing, I was very determined to have him as my coach, so I stayed in touch with him in the months after Beijing,\u201d Walker said. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Bree, there\u2019s no way that you\u2019ll be able to get Pierre Lueders as your coach\u2019. I was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to be able to do this, I just need to find a way to make it happen\u2019. \u201cI was a big enough pest that he eventually came around, and we\u2019ve been working together ever since. It\u2019s really been quite a journey building up to this point. He always says that he had a plan when we began, and it was just a plan to grow and develop across the years. We\u2019ve done a pretty good job of that so far. It\u2019s all coming together this year.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLueders says Walker\u2019s campaign to recruit him pre-dated the 2022 Olympics. \u201cActually, Bree had already spoken to me prior to the China Olympics in 2022 at the last world cup event,\u201d Lueders told this masthead. \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk again in the summer coming up in 2022\u2019, and that\u2019s what she did. She was very persistent in terms of trying to get me on board, and I was actually speaking with another team. Finally, I just said to them, \u2018That\u2019s enough, I\u2019m not going to wait around for you guys\u2019, and I just decided that I would try and help Bree achieve her goals.\u201d Bree Walker in the gym. Credit: Instagram: @a_sto Lueders is Walker\u2019s head coach, but he is one of many who have helped her get this far. \u201cI have physios, I have mentors, sport psychs, dietitian,\u201d Walker says. \u201cIt really is a village.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer physical coach, Will Morgan, is based in Australia and dictates her running, sprinting and lifting training. Then there is Lydia Lassila, the aerial skier who won gold for Australia at Vancouver in 2010 and bronze in Sochi in 2014, who has been mentoring Walker. \u201cI like to collect my Olympic champions,\u201d laughs Walker. \u201cIf you want to be one, you learn from the best, right?\u201d Former Olympic champion in aerial skiing Lydia Lassila. Credit: Getty Images The final piece to the puzzle was push coach Olaf Hampel. Another Olympic champion, from the Lillehammer 1994 and Nagano 1998 Games, Hampel approached Walker about helping her in this Olympic cycle. Originally, she knocked him back. \u201cHe kept coming back each year, and I admire that because that\u2019s kind of what I did in order to get [Lueders] on board,\u201d Walker says. \u201cHe just kept in contact with my head coach and was like, \u2018I can see potential in Bree, I really would like to be able to help her reach that\u2019. \u201cThis year, I was like, \u2018We have nothing to lose \u2013 let\u2019s get this guy on board and see if he can make a difference in my push starts\u2019, and I believe that he has.\u201d From pre-season to world cup\n\nAdvertisement",

It acknowledged that the lines are \"not legally enforceable\".\n\nBut the neighbouring Hornsby Council strictly prohibited the act, despite an online suggestion that it had earlier approved the idea.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Hornsby Shire Council does not allow or support the installation of any road markings by residents,\" a spokesperson told Yahoo.\n\nDo you have an illegal parking story?
