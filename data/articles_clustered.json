    "text": "US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jnr's new vaccine advisers have alarmed paediatricians after announcing inquiries into some long-settled questions about children's shots.\n\nOpening the first meeting of Kennedy's handpicked seven-member panel, committee chairman Martin Kulldorff said he was appointing a work group to evaluate the \"cumulative effect\" of the children's vaccine schedule \u2014 the list of immunisations given at different times throughout childhood.\n\nAlso to be evaluated, he said, was how two other shots were administered \u2014 one that guards against liver-destroying hepatitis B and another that combines chickenpox protection with MMR, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.\n\nUS Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers alarmed pediatricians Wednesday by announcing inquiries into some long-settled questions about children's shots. (AP)\n\nIt was an early sign of how the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices is being reshaped by Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation's top health official.\n\nHe fired the entire 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.\n\n\"Vaccines are not all good or bad,\" Kulldorff said. \"We are learning more about vaccines over time\" and must \"keep up to date.\"\n\nHis announcement reflected a common message of vaccine skeptics: that too many shots may overwhelm kids' immune systems or that the ingredients may build up to cause harm.\n\nScientists say those claims have been repeatedly investigated with no signs of concern.\n\nDr. Martin Kulldorf speaks during a meeting of the Advisory Committee in Immunization Practices at the CDC. (AP)\n\nKids today are exposed to fewer antigens \u2014 immune-revving components \u2014 than their grandparents despite getting more doses, because of improved vaccine technology, said Dr Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nThe American Academy of Paediatrics announced that it would continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now would do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \"no longer a credible process\".\n\n\"The narrative that current vaccine policies are flawed and need 'fixing' is a distortion,\" said the AAP's Dr Sean O'Leary.\n\n\"These policies have saved trillions of dollars and millions of lives.\"\n\nThe ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when.\n\nThose recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they're available, such as at pharmacies.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez arrive for Venice wedding amid protests\n\nParticipants listen during a meeting of the Advisory Committee in Immunization Practices at the CDC. (AP)\n\nAfter Kennedy's abrupt dismissal of the existing expert panel, a number of the CDC's top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.\n\nAnd shortly before Wednesday's meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist appointed to the committee stepped down.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration, he withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.\n\nScientists show data that COVID-19 vaccines protect pregnant women and kids\n\nFirst on the committee's agenda were COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nKennedy already sidestepped the panel and announced the vaccine would no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women.\n\nYet CDC scientists told the panel that vaccination was \"the best protection\" during pregnancy, and said most children hospitalised for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.\n\nCOVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 US deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalisations since last fall, according to the CDC.\n\nKennedy already sidestepped the panel and announced the vaccine will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women. (Getty images)\n\nMost at risk for hospitalisation are seniors and children under two \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mother got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.\n\nThe new advisers weren't asked to vote on Kennedy's recommendations, which raise uncertainty about how easily people will be able to access COVID-19 vaccinations this fall.\n\nAfter CDC staff outlined multiple overlapping systems that continue to track the vaccines' safety, several advisers questioned if the real-world data really is trustworthy.\n\nCommittee will vote on RSV protections\n\nNext, the committee took up RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.\n\nIn 2023, US health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.\n\nThe committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot and vote on updated recommendations.\n\nThe committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot and vote on updated recommendations.

    "text": "Multibillionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez arrived in Venice on Wednesday ahead of their star-studded weekend wedding, an event that has galvanised a wide assortment of activist groups protesting it.\n\nBezos waved from a water taxi as he and Sanchez arrived at the dock of the Aman Hotel, a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal, with two security boats in tow.\n\nThe event has drawn protests by groups who view it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots, while residents complain it exemplifies the way their needs are disregarded in the era of mass tourism to the historic lagoon city.\n\nBezos waved from a water taxi as he and Sanchez arrived at the dock of the Aman Hotel. (AP)\n\nLocal activists have planned a more organised protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. (AP)\n\nAbout a dozen Venetian organisations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \"No Space for Bezos\", a play on words also referring to the groom's space tourism venture and the bride's recent space flight.\n\nThey have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined on Monday by Greenpeace and the British group \"Everyone Hates Elon\", which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St Mark's Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.\n\nOn Wednesday, other activists launched a float down the Grand Canal featuring a mannequin of Bezos clinging onto an Amazon box, his fists full of fake dollars. The British publicity firm that announced the stunt said it wasn't a protest of the wedding \"but against unchecked wealth, media control, and the growing privatisation of public spaces\".\n\nThere has been no comment from Bezos' representatives on the protests.\n\nThe local activists had planned a more organised protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. They modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organisers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested centre.\n\nThe event has drawn protests by groups who view it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots. (AP)\n\n\"It will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\" said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \"We want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"\n\nAmong the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nVenice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.\n\nBezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tonnes traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.\n\n\"Bezos is not a Hollywood actor,\" Cacciari said. \"He is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\"\n\nLauren Sanchez arrives at a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal, with two security boats in tow. (AP)\n\nLauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in March. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nCritics cite Amazon's labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos' political associations as reasons for concern.\n\nActivists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritisation of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice's image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.\n\nCity officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honour for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.\n\n\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\" Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.\n\nMeanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos' Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \"important donation\".\n\nCorila, which unites university scholars and Italy's main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn't say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

    "text": "Winter can be a contagious time of year for everything from COVID-19 to the common cold.\n\nOnce someone in your household feels the first ominous tickle at the back of their throat, everyone else can feel doomed to follow.\n\n\"It's always a challenge within households because we know households are the place where viruses like respiratory viruses spread really efficiently,\" says Catherine Bennett, Deakin University's chair of epidemiology.\n\nBut there are ways to limit the risk of illnesses spreading from one family member or housemate to another, she says.\n\nShould you isolate at home?\n\nProfessor Bennett says if someone within your household becomes sick, it is possible you have already been exposed before they had any symptoms.\n\nHowever, if the sick person can isolate from the rest of household it's still worth it, she says. Ideally this would look like using a separate bedroom and bathroom to others.\n\nShe says this degree of isolation is not possible or realistic for many households.\n\nDarran Foo says advice on isolating from the rest of the household can vary, depending on the infection or virus someone has. (Supplied: Healthdirect)\n\nIsolation can also look like someone sleeping on the couch to \"reduce their risk of inhaling the virus\" from their unwell partner overnight, she says.\n\nMedical director for government-funded online public health information service Healthdirect Darran Foo says if possible, the symptomatic person should remain isolated from the rest of the household until they no longer have active symptoms.\n\nFor example, \"no more ongoing fevers, no more coughing up lots of phlegm\".\n\nConsider wearing a mask\n\nIf someone in the household is symptomatic, and isolating completely is not possible, Professor Bennett says a mask can help protect the rest of the household.\n\n\"Wearing a mask if you're unwell can reduce your risk of passing it on to other people.\"\n\nDr Foo also advises wearing a mask if it's possible and practical, particularly if you live in a smaller home like an apartment.\n\nSanitise contaminated surfaces and wash hands\n\nDr Foo recommends throwing used tissues away immediately and avoiding sharing cups, plates and cutlery in the household when someone is unwell, whether from a cold or COVID-19.\n\n\"The biggest thing really is to maintain good hygiene, especially good hand hygiene,\" Dr Foo says.\n\n\"Lots of hand washing and using sanitisers as much as possible.\"\n\nProfessor Benett also says you should \"wash your own hands more often in between touching things, even around the home\" when you or someone else is sick.\n\nShe recommends wiping down commonly used surfaces \u2014 such as the bathroom \u2014 more often. Any surfaces where someone has coughed may have droplets over them, she says.\n\nFind ways to boost ventilation\n\nProfessor Bennett says \"bugs do so well [in winter because] we can't air our houses out\".\n\nPoor ventilation will make it easier for viruses to spread, but she says increasing air turnover and introducing outdoor air can help.\n\nOpen doors and windows when you can \"so it's not the same air pushing right through the household that's around the person who's unwell.\"\n\nDr Foo also says the more ventilation you can get at home the better, while of course avoiding hypothermia.\n\nCatherine Bennett says there is often a trade-off between ventilation and keeping warm. (Supplied)\n\nWhat should you do if someone in the house is immunocompromised?\n\nDr Foo says \"the general advice all remains the same\" if someone in the household is potentially more vulnerable.\n\nThe rules around isolating when you're sick with COVID or the flu Photo shows A man and woman wearing a mask, sitting on a park bench with distance between them What has changed since the pandemic when it comes to isolating when sick, whether it's COVID or a bad cold?\n\nHowever, he says people more at risk of becoming seriously unwell may want to consult their regular healthcare professional who knows their medical history.\n\n\"It really depends on that person's risk, their comorbidities and what ongoing conditions they have \u2014 and also to identify whether it's appropriate to use antiviral medication at that point in time.\"\n\nProfessor Bennett says being diligent with mask wearing, hand washing and sanitising surfaces is particularly worth doing if someone in the house is vulnerable.\n\nMake sure your vaccinations are up to date\n\nProfessor Bennett says being up to date with COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations will offer another layer of protection.\n\n\"If you can't avoid infection in the household \u2014 and that's the hardest place to do it \u2014 then actually having some protection from severe illness is really important in influenza.\"\n\nIn larger shared households there are more people to bring viruses home and that extra protection from vaccination is even more important, \"particularly from severe illness in the vulnerable people in our households\", Professor Bennett says.\n\nDr Foo also encourages people to stay up to date with their vaccinations, \"especially their annual flu vaccination and their COVID booster shots\".\n\nThis is general information only. For personal advice, you should see a qualified medical practitioner.",

    "text": "Football is a game for all seasons. The ball is first bounced for the year in the waning hours of summer, with play continuing through autumn, winter and spring.\n\nThe conditions of any two (non-indoor) football games are rarely the same. Football is played at all hours of the day across all corners of the country. It's not just rain, hail or shine \u2014 it's also blustery gales and sunny days, steamy nights and even snow.\n\nPreparing to beat the conditions along with opponents has been an obsession for footballers for generations. Over time, different game styles have emerged to conquer the elements, whatever they are.\n\nPlayers, teams and businesses have also attempted technological solutions \u2014 from sticky substances to more stable boots, waterproof footies to ice vests \u2014 to try to get an edge.\n\nAt the same time, football is spanning across more of the year than ever before. That means an extra element \u2014 high heat \u2014 is getting more common in footy games.\n\nDifferent teams tend to excel in different conditions, leading to wild swings depending on the weather.\n\nSo, how does football change depending on the season? And what teams do better in different conditions?\n\nCold and wet winters\n\nIn its development as a sport, Australian Football was designed as a winter game, a counterpart to the summer pursuit of cricket. For most of the game's history, footy took the grounds when it was too wet or cold to play cricket.\n\nIn its suburban past (and grassroots present), mud, sweat and tears were common elements of football.\n\nAlthough the grounds have improved over time, rain still affects play. Teams still need to consider how to approach the game when the ground becomes slippery or sodden.\n\nWet-weather footy has its own lexicon, separate and different from how the game is played in the dry.\n\nThen-Richmond VFL coach and current Collingwood coach Craig McRae broke down the basics of wet-weather football in 2017 when talking to Richmond great Matthew Richardson.\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every round of the AFL and NRL seasons in 2025.\n\n\"[It's about] just doing the fundamentals right, not trying to overuse it \u2014 which we do sometimes,\" McRae explained.\n\n\"It's a subtle change. We're playing a lot of contested footy, kicking long down the line \u2026 it sort of plays into wet-weather conditions well.\"\n\n\"We want to get territory \u2026 Even just punching the ball off the ground \u2014 just keep the ball going forward. Sometimes it doesn't look pretty.\"\n\nMcRae might be one of the best judges of how to play in the wet. Since 2022, no side has been better in wet weather conditions than the Pies.\n\nNot every team plays the same amount of time in the wet. Docklands home teams have less chance to experience such conditions.\n\nPerth tends to be sunnier and drier. Sydney teams and outdoor Victorian teams can spend nearly one in six games dealing with the rain.\n\nThat means that getting to know how to play in the wet can be tougher for some teams.\n\nTackles, pressure and turnovers go up when the rain falls, and scoring shots diminish. There are more contested possessions across the ground and less ball in space.\n\nMarks go down generally but stoppages jump a ton. Defenders also have an easier time winning their one-on-one contests and spoils tend to spike.\n\nIf you win the contested possession battle in the dry, you win about 64 per cent of the time. In the wet, it jumps to 69 per cent. There's an even larger increase for teams that win forward 50 ground ball gets (61 per cent to 72 per cent).\n\nIf all this sounds like a bit of a throwback, then you are probably right.\n\nWet-weather footy now tends to resemble footy \u2014 wet or dry \u2014 of the past. In the wet, the game tends to be played more in a straight line, with the field stretched out. Teams use the corridor significantly less (around 20 per cent less) when transitioning from defence in the wet, and are often reluctant to switch.\n\nHow Collingwood has reinvented itself to become this season's team to beat Photo shows GettyImages-2214886183 They went from winning the flag in 2023 to missing finals last year, and as they lead the AFL pack in 2025, the data shows this isn't just good old Collingwood forever.\n\nWidth is used less and positions are adhered to more. Even with the improvements to boots, grounds and the football itself, the first principles of footy \u2014 ground position and possession \u2014 come to the fore.\n\nIn short, it's a bit like 80s footy. Staying in front of the ball \u2014 and your opponent \u2014 is critical.\n\n\"It's one of the things you learn as a kid coming through, you don't let the ball over the back in wet conditions,\" Sydney coach John Longmire stated in 2014.\n\nLongmire's Swans played in one of the wettest games in recent memory just two years later when over 250mm of rain hit the Gold Coast before and during their game against the Suns.\n\nA deluge of rain at Carrara in 2016 made visibility, never mind ball control, extremely difficult for the Suns and Swans. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nThere's also a significant increase in the amount of contested knock-ons and ground kicks in the wet \u2014 almost a quarter more, this year. That ability to gain territory at all costs is still the main fundamental for teams when rain strikes.\n\nThere's some school of thought that teams may be a little too conservative when adapting to the wet these days. Brisbane, for example, was slick in handling the ball in slippery conditions at Kardinia Park last week. The Lions were willing to stretch the ground and switch the ball where possible.\n\n\"It was quite slippery out there. It looked slippery for us \u2014 didn't look as slippery for them,\" quipped Geelong coach Chris Scott to ABC Sport after their loss last week.\n\nBut the wet isn't the only type of weather footy players have to deal with.\n\nFour seasons in one competition\n\nWhile wet weather takes much of the attention, other weather conditions can significantly impact how football is played.\n\nTake that Geelong-Brisbane match that Scott was talking about last week. That game was played in slippery conditions \u2014 but it didn't rain before or during the game. Instead, it was a combination of cold and humid conditions that created dew on the field and ball.\n\nMoisture \u2014 whether dew, frost or general greasiness \u2014 tends to occur when the relative humidity starts to approach 100 per cent.\n\nABC AFL Daily podcast Host Catherine Murphy is joined by premiership-winning coach Paul Roos to bring you your daily dose of AFL conversation. The team give you context and depth beyond the headlines in this footy conversation that's equal parts thoughtful, insightful and fun.\n\nAs the air saturates with moisture, the game starts to look soggy \u2014 similar to a wet-weather game. Contested ball becomes more important, and it becomes significantly harder to mark the ball.\n\n\"It wasn't a pretty game of footy but it's not a 'pretty game of footy weekend'. It was pretty slippery all over the place this weekend,\" Port coach Ken Hinkley explained to ABC Sport after their win over GWS in Canberra earlier this month.\n\n\"Of course you have to adjust to what you play [to] what the conditions are so, you know, it's something we had to do.\"\n\nThat game was also quite cold, peaking at just 6 degrees. Surprisingly that's not the coldest game this year \u2014 with the Adelaide-Hawthorn match-up at Launceston dropping slightly closer to freezing. Both games were low-scoring slogs.\n\nCold-weather footy is often accompanied by rain or dew. Even when it's dry, it's unpleasant. It's something that the league doesn't experience too often, but the introduction of the Tassie Devils might see it become more commonplace.\n\nCold-weather footy sees some impacts to scoring and ball movement but not much difference in contest around the ball, unlike wet weather.\n\nTasmania \u2014 and Hobart in particular \u2014 often also sees blustery conditions and howling winds. That also can significantly affect the way the game is played.\n\nWindy games see far fewer marks taken but more territory gained in total. There are also more turnovers, and targets are harder to hit by hand or foot.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Fremantle with their famous \"doctor\" play in gusty winds the most. More surprisingly, Essendon doesn't play in the wind much \u2014 showing their distance from their Windy Hill days.\n\nThe introduction of Tassie will also exacerbate something alluded to above: the length of the season.\n\nThe ever-increasing length of the season has seen an increase of games in warm and very hot conditions. The first four rounds of the season saw the AFL Heat Policy enacted each week, with extended quarter-time breaks and additional water carriers permitted.\n\nThat's something the AFLW has had to deal with as it has expanded and something that players in that competition have struggled with.\n\nLions question midday start time Photo shows Will McLachlan of the Brisbane Lions stands on the Gabba with his hands on his hips. The decision to start the AFL clash between the Lions and Eagles at midday in late March in Brisbane is questioned by coach Chris Fagan and club legend Jason Akermanis.\n\nHot-weather games tend to see faster, freer-flowing football with more uncontested marks and bounces than in colder conditions. There's more uncontested ball and fewer stoppages. Ball retention becomes easier in general.\n\nBut there are also other real risks to playing in heat. After his team played a midday game against West Coast in the blazing sun, Brisbane coach Chris Fagan was blunt about how it negatively affected the players.\n\n\"They were pretty cooked, and you could tell just walking out onto the ground after \u2014 probably a record number of cramps, I don't know.\" Fagan mused.\n\n\"I haven't seen that many of our blokes struggle like that [before].\"\n\nRegardless of the heat, cold, rain, wind or even snow, footy can change at the drop of a weather forecast \u2014 and your team might just be the one to capitalise.",

(Supplied: RMC)\n\nA TT-Line spokesperson did not say when Spirit V was expected to set sail for Tasmania, or whether any further works or sea trials needed to be completed before it did.\n\nOn Sunday, Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff said the other new ferry, Spirit of Tasmania IV, would arrive in Australia from Scotland in August.\n\nIt follows a lengthy infrastructure debacle, when it emerged last year that TT-Line had failed to build a berth for the vessels in Devonport on time.\n\nIt is not expected to be completed until at least October 2026.\n\nJeremy Rockliff said Spirit IV was expected to arrive in August.

    "text": "There had been a lot of change in Australia's batting line up coming into this Test.\n\nThere was a suggestion that this was the start of Australia's new batting era.\n\nWith Steve Smith injured, Marnus Labuschagne dropped and Australia stinging after a South African ambush in north west London, now was the time to chance one's arm.\n\nAnd with these three Tests the only trials before the Ashes, it really is now or never.\n\nWith Sam Konstas and Josh Inglis thrown into the side together, there was a feeling that this was the start of the much-needed renewal of this Australian top order.\n\nBut as much as things change, they remain the same and, after a horror first hour that saw the Aussies reduced to 3-22 in the 16th over, it took two settled veterans to rescue the Australian blushes.\n\nSam Konstas never got into his groove. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nThat opening hour was, in short, a complete disaster for Australia.\n\nKonstas was out for three. Green was out for three \u2014 having already been dropped on zero. Inglis was out for five.\n\nHad Windies debutant Brandon King not suffered a case of the butter fingers at gully, Khawaja would had been added to that list for a total of just six as well \u2014 a dismissal that would have added to a trend of low scores for Australia's only stable column at the top of the order.\n\nIt was a desperately nervous start, the batters twitchy and uncertain on a deck that offered plenty of movement.\n\nThose nerves may be understandable \u2014 but none of the problems are new.\n\nMuch in the way that Australia was struggling to reorder its batters the last time these two sides met in a Test series in 2024 following the retirement of David Warner, the Aussies were still in almost exactly the same place, none the wiser as to who should sit at the top of the order.\n\nSince Warner's retirement the opening partners have come and gone for Khawaja \u2014 Smith, Labuschagne, Travis Head, Konstas and Nathan McSweeney \u2014 all taking their turns, a confused conveyor of curious options, none of which ever quite fitted.\n\nSam Konstas looked nervous and unsure in his first Carribean Test. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nMaking a snap judgement of the prospects of this line up off the basis of one innings on a tough pitch away from home is absurd. On flatter Australian pitches this line up would likely excel.\n\nBut even a two-paced pitch could not excuse some of the woeful top-order batting on display from some of Australia's new guard.\n\nThe hype around Konstas over the past 12 months meant that his return to the side to partner Khawaja was given a similar vibe to the Special Ks from the tennis world, but in its first iteration this series they ended up looking just as flaky as the breakfast cereal.\n\nKonstas looked cagey, lasting just 14 nervous deliveries where he barely middled a single ball before being trapped LBW by the brilliant Shamar Joseph \u2014 albeit by a superb, seaming delivery of the type that openers are liable to be faced with.\n\nProponents of the 19-year-old's premature promotion to the Test side \u2014 this is just his 31st first-class innings from 17 matches and only his third Test match \u2014 will say his development into a free-hitting David Warner-esque opener needs challenges like this.\n\nAnd they are right.\n\nThere is enough development to come from Konstas that making sweeping, grandiose statements based on a single innings in unfamiliar conditions in Bridgetown would be to assume every game he plays will be like that Boxing Day blast with which he flustered Jasprit Bumrah six months ago is his default, and unless he reverse sweeps every ball he faces, every innings is a failure.\n\nJoseph was exceptional throughout the day, bowling to a plan and hitting a testing length to everyone, Australia's Gabba golem back to torment the Australian batters once again.\n\nShamar Joseph, left, took two wickets in the opening hour. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nHis delivery to bowl Beau Webster for 11 before tea was just about unplayable, deviating away and clipping the top of the off bail.\n\nHe should have had a second wicket in the same over he dismissed Konstas, finding the edge of Green's bat only to see debutant Brandon King shell a simple chance at gully.\n\nJoseph tormented Green, beating his edge repeatedly, the West Australian guilty of playing way outside his body with the hard hands that cost him against South Africa at Lord's.\n\nDespite seeing Khawaja dropped by his skipper at first slip during that spell, Joseph didn't let his head drop, finding the edge of Green's bat again to end his erratic stay, Justin Greaves taking a brilliant low catch at second slip.\n\nThe manner of the Australians' dismissals should give rise to some concerns about their suitability of batting at the top of the order against anything close to resembling a moving ball.\n\nJayden Seales took five wickets as Australia imploded on day one in Barbados. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nOn a pitch that was clearly not as placid as had been advertised, all of Australia's top three were guilty of playing a long way from their bodies, inviting the edges that eventually cost Konstas and Green their wickets.\n\nKonstas was trapped on the crease, non-existent footwork again his weakness, while Green was too desperate to get bat on ball, pushing his hands way outside the line and paid the price as a result.\n\nInglis had looked relatively comfortable while he was at the crease but a lack of patience saw him swing wildly at a short delivery that he skied, Shai Hope taking a simple catch.\n\nAustralia hadn't scored a single boundary inside the opening 15 overs, trapped inside a cage of doubt built by a muddled selection strategy and reinforced by the failures of the top order.\n\nAs is so often the case, it took Travis Head to come in and change the narrative with yet another magnificent 53.\n\nTravis Head led Australia's recovery before lunch. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nAs is his wont, Head dropped to one knee and slapped a wide delivery through the covers with a conviction that had been entirely lacking from the Aussie batters before him for his first runs off just the fifth delivery he faced.\n\nThat, the first boundary of the innings, came off the 96th ball of the match.\n\nHead's masterful application of controlled aggression, cutting and scything anything wide of the stumps seemed to offer the necessary reset to Khawaja, who launched Alzarri Joseph over square leg for a massive six just three balls after Australia broke its boundary duck.\n\nIn all, Australia scored five boundaries in the next 16 balls, the shackles finally released by the old stagers.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nKhawaja was far from his vintage best, his cagey footwork and instability in the shot lending itself to some muddled decisions and a host of false shots he was fortunate did not result in him losing his wicket long before he eventually departed for 47 \u2014 especially as he was dropped on 45.\n\nHis 128-ball stay was exactly what Australia needed, but you'd be hard pushed to say it was all plain sailing, and reflects an increasingly worrying trend.\n\nThe 38-year-old has scored just two centuries in his last 42 innings \u2014 although to be fair one of those was a massive double in Galle earlier this year.\n\nThe progression is only trending one way now, sadly.\n\nHead though, was exceptional. Again.\n\nLast time he played the West Indies he got a king pair for the first and only time in his Test career, the start of a rare slump when he scored just 80 runs in seven innings.\n\nThere was a degree of luck in his extended stay, the South Australian surviving a fearsome barrage from Shamar Joseph shortly before tea and only avoiding being given out for 53 by a charitable decision by third umpire Adrian Holdstock.\n\nIt was a good job that Head's luck held though, because outside him it was slim pickings from a batting perspective.",

    "text": "Miley Cyrus has one of the best voices in contemporary pop. And in 2023, she showed it off with signature, inescapable hit 'Flowers', a break-up survival anthem perfectly suited to her voice's lived-in smokiness.\n\nFast Facts about Miley Cyrus: Something Beautiful What: Miley Cyrus's \"pop opera\" visual album for her excellent ninth release. Starring: Miley Cyrus Directed by: Miley Cyrus, Jacob Bixenham, Brendan Walter Where: In cinemas June 27, one night only Likely to make you feel: Like the term \"pop opera\" is a stretch\n\nBut the reason for that wonderful texture and grit is also why the former Disney star isn't taking a victory lap tour of her 9th album, Something Beautiful, released this June to some of the most glowing reviews of her career.\n\nThe 32-year-old has Reinke's edema, a swelling of her vocal cords that has given her a large polyp, producing the gritty texture to her voice. Surgery could ruin her voice entirely.\n\nAs she recently told Apple Music interviewer Zane Lowe, the condition most affects performing, making it \"like running a marathon with ankle weights on\", which is why her last global tour was more than a decade ago.\n\nInstead of touring, Cyrus has created a cinema-exclusive (for now) \"pop opera\" and visual album for Something Beautiful, screening for one night only across Australia this Friday.\n\nShe describes the hour-long film as a conceptual album about healing, telling Harper's Bazaar it was like Pink Floyd's The Wall \"but with a better wardrobe and more glamorous, and filled with pop culture\".\n\nMoving on from Hannah\n\nA large-scale statement like a visual album offers an interesting artistic opportunity for Cyrus, a fascinating figure who hasn't necessarily found a creative through line to match her natural charisma, perhaps more concerned with wrestling off her Disney star beginnings as Hannah Montana.\n\nThe album Something Beautiful was described by Variety as \"equal parts thrilling and challenging\". (Supplied: Photo by Glen Luchford)\n\nFifteen years on from hanging up Hannah's golden wig, Cyrus has certainly created distance, most pointedly with the boisterous, hyper-sexual R&B rebellion of 2013's Bangerz, which generated plenty of controversy.\n\nIn recent years, she's largely settled on a series of more mature pop albums tinged with different genres, including country (2017's Younger Now), glam rock (2020's Plastic Hearts) and light synth-pop (2023's Endless Summer Vacation).\n\nSonically, Something Beautiful is a coalescence of those recent albums \u2014 a mixture of prog-rock, soul, jazz, disco and R&B united by a grand air and a timeless feel, with lots of belting and big, cinematic sounds.\n\nIt's everything a pop album should offer, with break-up ballads ('More To Lose'), love songs ('End of the World'), empowerment anthems ('Walk of Fame') and campy disco diva moments ('Every Girl You've Ever Loved', featuring spoken word from Naomi Campbell).\n\nThe healing concept doesn't exactly come through the music, though \u2014 unlike Lady Gaga's similarly themed 2020 album Chromatica, there's no clear lyrical through line or leitmotifs. This has led fans \u2014 and critics \u2014 to assume that the visuals, arriving weeks after the album, would tie things together.\n\n\"The film is my way of touring,\" Cyrus told Apple Music. \"You get a feel like you're a part of a performance, but I don't have to tax myself in that way.\" (Supplied: Trafalgar Releasing)\n\nUnfortunately, there's next to no narrative to Something Beautiful, an hour-long set of music videos that neither hone nor expand the album's world in the way that \"visual album\" has come to signify after Beyonc\u00e9 changed the game with that digital drop.\n\nSomething Beautiful \u2014 and not much else\n\nDirected by Cyrus with longtime collaborators Jacob Bixenman and Brendan Walter, the film starts strong but sidesteps much depth.\n\nRunning through the album in order, it opens with a series of ethereal shots set to Prelude, where Cyrus approximates Laurie Anderson's spoken word (\"Aching to be seen/Aching to become real\") over glitching synths.\n\nWe see a flower twisting, shadows and smoke, close-ups of Cyrus's body enclosed in crystal strands like a spider web as she wears the archival Thierry Mugler look from the album cover. Eerie, creepy, interesting.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nIt leads into the title track music video already available online, where Cyrus performs with a band on a smoky sound stage while in a custom feathery green snood by Mugler. Any sense of old-school, jazzy glamour is disrupted by the dual explosion of set lights and prog-rock in its chorus.\n\nThe premise of pristine beauty is muddied in favour of something grittier, more dangerous by these videos \u2014 an idea quickly abandoned. Instead, for most of Something Beautiful, we see Cyrus strut, lip-sync and play showgirl on various sound stages, donning extravagant archival looks by Mugler, as well as Bob Mackie and Jean Paul Gaultier.\n\nHalfway-point track 'Easy Lover' sees Cyrus walk through the Paramount lot between sets in a tracking shot, highlighting the artificiality of what we see as she moves from make-up to an elaborate set with dancers, always performing for us.\n\nThere's a charm to sitting with these songs and letting them wash over us, but Something Beautiful lacks the imagination to add much beyond pretty visuals, seeming more like the interstitial videos between numbers at a concert than a stand-in for a concert itself.\n\nWhile that might be expecting too much, the film debuted at Tribeca and is being touted as a cinematic event, but the closest Something Beautiful gets to The Wall is a creative block.\n\nHarrison Ford convinced Cyrus not to hold intimate performances in forests and other remote places. (Supplied: Photo by Glen Luchford)\n\nIt's a missed opportunity, whether limited by budget constraints or a lack of imagination.\n\nCompare it to Jennifer Lopez's completely over-the-top visual album from last year, This Is Me: Now\u2026 A Love Story, which was self-funded for $US20 million. A meta-narrative about Lopez and Ben Affleck's tumultuous love affair, it's also a convoluted sci-fi narrative featuring endless celebrity cameos and a steampunk heart factory at risk of explosion.\n\nCyrus didn't need to go full Lopez (nor should she), but at least This Is Me was ambitious, guided by a frenetic sense that Lopez needed to express whatever that film was.\n\nWithout that drive, Something Beautiful lacks energy: even if it is visually beautiful, anyone but devout fans will find themselves wishing for something more.\n\nMiley Cyrus: Something Beautiful is in cinemas for one night only on Friday June 27.",

    "text": "Travis Head gets a life, Usman Khawaja leads a charmed existence and Shamar Joseph rips through Australia once again, with the Aussies dismissed for 180 before taking 4-57 in the West Indies's first innings.\n\nHere are five quick hits from day one of Australia's first Test in the West Indies in a decade.\n\n1. Head's contentious non-dismissal\n\nThe home fans were in no doubt.\n\nNeither was Shamar Joseph.\n\nWicketkeeper Shai Hope was not certain though, looking to square leg umpire Nitin Menon with a question on his face as to whether the ball, bottom-edged by Travis Head, had carried into his gloves behind the stumps.\n\nIt turns out, third umpire Adrian Holdstock wasn't entirely sure either.\n\nThe South African said there was \"no clear evidence,\" to give Head out, despite footage appearing to show a slither of material between the ball and turf.\n\nThe \"NOT OUT\" sign on the big screen was greeted with relieved cheers from the Aussies and bemusement from the home supporters.\n\nJoseph could only laugh, incredulous along with the majority of the crowd who felt their man had been robbed of a fifth wicket of the innings.\n\nHead was on 53 at the time.\n\n2. Joseph rips through Aussies again\n\nJoseph wreaked havoc with the new ball on day one in Bridgetown. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nHe was the architect of that famous Gabba victory in 2024, and once again, Joseph was all over Australia on day one at Kensington Oval.\n\nHis first job was to ensure Sam Konstas's return to the Test match crease was a short one.\n\nThere were no sparkles or scoops in the 19-year-old's nervous three from 14 deliveries, which was over when he was caught plumb in front by an excellent Joseph delivery in the fourth over.\n\nAfter dismissing Konstas, the skiddy right arm pacer could have had both Cameron Green and Usman Khawaja in consecutive overs had it not been for some poor catching from his teammates.\n\nHowever, Green never looked comfortable against Joseph, and he was eventually dismissed for an indecisive three from 21 balls.\n\nJosh Inglis \u2014 the third new face in Australia's new look top four \u2014 didn't fair any better.\n\nJoseph bowled a near perfect delivery to dismiss Beau Webster. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nHe was out for five after horribly mistiming one off Jayden Seales.\n\nBut Joseph's finest moment came midway through the second session.\n\nBeau Webster played back to a good length ball that gathered pace and moved away from him off the pitch. The big Tasmanian's bat got nowhere near it and the ball kissed the top of off.\n\nThe perfect ball to cap a near-perfect day of bowling.\n\n3. Butter fingers in Barbados\n\nAs bad as things were for Australia in the opening hour, it could have been worse.\n\nGreen may have only made three runs, but he was dropped on zero by debutant Brandon King at gully.\n\nKhawaja's recovery effort with Head was vital, but the veteran, too, should have been back in the sheds in that first session, dropped on six by Roston Chase at first slip.\n\nBoth chances came off the bowling of Joseph.\n\nIt would be charitable to say that both catches were easy. It's far more accurate to say they were absolute sitters.\n\nKhawaja was later dropped on 45 too, this time off the bowling of Jayden Seales but by King again at gully, the Jamaican's dream debut turning desperately sour.\n\n4. Khawaja's charmed life\n\nUsman Khawaja was far from fluent in his 47. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nSometimes, it's just your day.\n\nAfter being put down, Khawaja continued to ride his luck for the entirety of his innings steadying knock.\n\nHe threaded an edge through the slips, built a catalogue of plays and misses and almost deflected one off his thigh pad onto the stumps.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nBut the most inexplicable moment of the lot came in the third over after lunch.\n\nTrying to work away a straight Justin Greaves delivery, Khawaja lost sight of the ball as it bobbled up off his pad and dropped at his feet.\n\nHe then proceeded to backheel the ball towards the stumps, before turning around and wildly swiping at it with his bat.\n\nHe missed the ball by some distance, and thankfully for Khawaja, just about missed his stumps as well.\n\nThe ball, almost forgotten in the melee, trickled harmlessly wide of the sticks.\n\nHowever, the 38-year-old wasn't able to make the most of his charmed existence, eventually being removed for 47 by the irrepressible Joseph.\n\n5. Starc strikes late on\n\nMitchell Starc took two wickets. (AP Photo: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nAs he so often does, it was Mitchell Starc who delivered late on for Australia.\n\nBowled out for 180, the tourists desperately needed something in the final hour and a half of play.\n\nThe experienced Kraigg Braithwaite edged to a tumbling Webster at second slip to get the ball rolling, before he had John Campbell edging behind to Alex Carey.\n\nThat left the West Indies 2-16 and under pressure.",

He's coached at the biggest clubs and I think the most important thing that he's implemented so far is possession-based football.\n\n\"I think we're very capable of doing that.\"\n\nAAP",

(Supplied: Office of the Inspector of Custodial Services)\n\nIn February, the Inspector of Custodial Services described conditions in Hakea as \"substandard and inhumane\", in part because of overcrowding.\n\nThe Justice Department said it had implemented \"a range of strategies\" to address \"short-term pressures caused by increased remand numbers\".\n\n\"These arrangements are carefully managed in line with operational risk assessments and individual welfare considerations,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"The department continues to monitor population trends as part of its long-term custodial infrastructure plan.\"\n\nPerth maximum security prison 'under great strain', report says Photo shows An aerial shot of the grounds of Hakea Prison WA's prisons watchdog puts the government on notice over the \"bleak\" situation inside Hakea Prison, which is buckling under overcrowded conditions.\n\nThe Justice Department told the ABC there had been 18 deaths in custody in the last year.\n\nDr Pettitt said the situation had reached crisis levels.\n\n\"The overcrowding in our prisons is jeopardising the safety of prison staff and prisoners, whilst undermining rehabilitation efforts and programs,\" he said.\n\n\"It should be a wake-up call and an opportunity for government to focus more strongly on preventative and rehabilitative programs, otherwise they will need to spend billions on more prisons.\"\n\nImprisonment rate due to FDV\n\nData from the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggests pressures on WA's prisons are not a new phenomenon.\n\nThose figures show WA's imprisonment rate, which was already the second highest in the country, increasing by 18 per cent between 2022 and earlier this year \u2014 more than three times the national average.\n\nThe government is allocating millions of dollars towards prisons like Casuarina. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\n\"One factor is an increase in the number of people charged with family and domestic violence offences,\" a Justice Department spokesperson said.\n\n\"This is a result of new FDV-related laws, a shift in community attitudes and increased confidence among victims to report offending.\"\n\nFormer inmate calls for change Photo shows A man with black hair and a long black beard in a shirt with glasses stands in front of buildings The death of a friend in jail by suicide prompted former inmate Kelvin Whitwell to become a counsellor on the outside.

    "text": "The New South Wales government has reaffirmed its plan for a state-of-the-art secondary school in the state's far west, allocating more than $55 million towards the project in the latest state budget.\n\nBroken Hill's Willyama High School has been closed for more than 18 months due to a significant mould outbreak, with the state government marking it for demolition and rebuild.\n\nMould ridden high school in Broken hill to be torn down Photo shows A ceiling inside a classroom with mould growth. A public high school in Broken Hill will be torn down and completely rebuilt after a severe mould infestation.\n\nConstruction crews and equipment are now on site and demolition is expected to begin soon but, until recently, the rebuild plans have been contentious.\n\nRedesign 'bigger and better'\n\nA Willyama P&C group formed this year led several local concerns, including inadequate classroom layouts and limited learning resources.\n\nBut president Kirby Allen, whose son will start year 7 at Willyama next year, said these issues seemed to have been addressed in a redesign released to the community last week.\n\n\"In comparison to what was shown in March, it's bigger [and] laid out a lot better,\" Ms Allen said.\n\n\"It was very evident that the feedback has been taken on board. Everyone's happy it's going in the right direction.\"\n\nThe school has been quarantined for more than a year and a half due to toxic mould within its walls. (ABC News: Oliver Brown)\n\nThe formal consultation process for the new school design is believed to be finished and the rebuild is likely to be put out to tender in the coming weeks.\n\nFormal budget allocated\n\nThe government plans to begin construction early next year and have the school open to more than 730 students by early 2027.\n\nWhile the rebuild has been more than a year in the making the government has now allocated $56.4 million of the 2025-'26 state budget to it.\n\nAn impression of the proposed state-of-the-art Willyama High School.

(Supplied: Peter Macbeth)\n\nThe Department of Education's Far West Director of Educational Leadership, Peter Macbeth, said he looked forward to working with the community on a school everyone could be proud of.\n\n\"It's a really exciting and incredible thing for the community and it's gaining lots of positive momentum,\" Mr Macbeth said.",

Got it Share\n\nOn a Sunday earlier this month, Ben Williamson and Tyron Simon sat on a patch of grass and looked across James Street. It was Agnes Bakery\u2019s final day of trade. \u201cI brought the kids and the family and the dogs down, and then Ty came down and we got a couple of pastries and a coffee and sat and just looked at it,\u201d Williamson says. Idle opened on Merthyr Road last weekend. Markus Ravik Until that moment, the celebrated chef hadn\u2019t considered what the closure of Agnes Bakery meant to him and what came to be known as Anyday, the restaurant group he co-owns with Simon, Bianca Marchi and Frank Li.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe started talking about it and it all kind of hit me,\u201d Williamson says, \u201c\u2018Man, what a journey to get to this point.\u2019 \u201d Related Article Brisbane\u2019s best chook sanger? Here\u2019s a textural, flavour-filled contender Agnes Bakery started as a hail Mary \u2013 an unfettered dice roll in the face of a global pandemic. This was back in the final week of March in 2020 in the Spring Hill premises of Agnes the restaurant, which had been due to open the same week. Seemingly against the odds, it was a hit, with locked-down punters queueing around the block for woodfired bread and pastries (and perhaps a little human interaction outside of their own four walls). Unlike its predecessor, Agnes Bakery, Idle is a full-service cafe. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen lockdown restrictions eased and the group geared up to open Agnes as a restaurant, it made sense to move the bakery to its own space on the corner of James and Harcourt streets. There, it established itself as a local favourite, with the lines this time stretching down the hill towards The Calile hotel. In the meantime, Williamson, Simon, Li and Marchi had opened Bianca on Ada Lane, opposite The Calile, which became another roaring success, and then went on to formalise their identity as Anyday. Behind the counter, regulars will find all the breads and pastries they\u2019ve become accustomed to queueing for at Agnes Bakery. Markus Ravik So the word \u201cjourney\u201d feels appropriate. When Agnes Bakery wrapped at the end of that Sunday, the staff would begin the process of packing down and migrating over to Merthyr Road in New Farm to Idle, its full-service successor, which opened last weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich makes you wonder: why call time on this little bakery (or brand, perhaps) that could, which has come to mean so much to so many people, not least of all Williamson, Simon, Li and Marchi themselves? Harissa egg danish. Markus Ravik \u201cIt had sort of become its own thing anyway,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cEspecially when Mitch [Suchowacki] came on board as head baker. It really started to evolve. \u201cIt was like this little sibling constantly living in the shadow of Agnes [the restaurant], which had become such a beast of its own that it didn\u2019t make sense any more to keep them connected. So this was a great opportunity for us to give it its own identity.\u201d If the closure of Agnes Bakery is the end of one chapter, Idle is the start of another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater this year, Anyday will open a clutch of venues in the heritage-listed Coal Board Building in the guts of Brisbane\u2019s CBD. It will be the group\u2019s most ambitious project yet. Idle sourdough crumpets with creme fraiche and berry compote. Markus Ravik In that sense, Idle feels like something of a test run. When this masthead visits on a busy Tuesday morning, Williamson, Simon and Marchi are all there, overseeing service, and running food to the al fresco tables lined along Merthyr Road and up a brick-lined side lane. The tables are gathered around an indoor service area designed by Tamsin Johnson, best known locally for her work on Raes on Watego and the Sir boutique on James Street. She\u2019s given the venue a light and bright treatment, with plenty of stainless-steel and custom terrazzo, the standout feature some Italian futurist light fittings. It feels sleek and modern without drifting into the austere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdle features a design by in-demand Tamsin Johnson. Markus Ravik Idle serves everything regulars have become accustomed to at Agnes Bakery \u2013 fire-licked sourdough loaves, Basque cheesecakes, caneles, kouign-amanns and so on \u2013 but also a relatively expansive brunch menu designed by Williamson Suchowacki. There are your usual cafe go-tos given an Idle twist: sourdough crumpets with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and a berry compote, porridge with white miso, cinnamon poached quince, coconut and walnut, and a bacon and fried egg roll with waffle fries and relish. \u201cWe started talking about it and it all kind of hit me: \u2018Man, what a journey to get to this point.\u2019 \u201d Idle co-owner Ben Williamson But there\u2019s also more elevated dishes such as Baghdad eggs with a cumin burnt butter, smoked almond, a flaky flatbread and mint; a steamed spanner crab omelette with chilli, choron (a tomato-spiked b\u00e9arnaise), salmon roe and toast; and a continental-style breakfast with ham, asiago, house-made butter, and a cucumber and fennel pickle, served with a baguette and soft-boiled egg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all about as thoughtful as you\u2019d expect from Anyday, and from 11am, free-range charcoal chicken, fries, and daily salads and sandwiches are added to the mix. Beyond pastries and brunch, Idle stocks a bunch of pantry items on its back wall. Markus Ravik Idle serves specialty coffee by Single O, and shelving on the back wall stocks a bunch of pantry items including wine, house-made granola and condiments, and fancy Torres potato chips from Spain. Beyond its meaning for Anyday, Idle is a welcome addition in New Farm but also the city generally, where full-service cafe openings have become increasingly rare in the post-pandemic age. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of Agnes Bakery clientele coming down, but also a lot of locals, who are often people in their 50s and 60s,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cWe thought it might be a challenge to get some of [them] across the line, but they\u2019ve responded well. It\u2019s been really great.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpen Mon-Sun 7am-2pm. 84 Merthyr Road, New Farm, (07) 3062 2346. anyday.com.au\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

    "text": "But there are many exceptions. One of them was The Back Page, the sports panel show which has finished up this week after a 29-year run. As one who was on it for its first decade and a bitty, I have been inundated with emails, texts and calls this week, from those lamenting its demise.\n\n\u201cIt is normally perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench through the heart of the journalism industry, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs, for no good reason. Which is more or less true. For the most part, they are dirty little animals with huge brains and no pulse.\u201d\n\nInevitably, many of the obits have focused on its latter years \u2013 which is fair enough because, to my amazement, it has been bloody successful for the last two decades, too, and really was a great show. With its latter-day incarnation hosted by Tony Squires and boasting panellists such as Crash Craddock, Adam Spencer and Candice Warner, the thing was still working and doing great box office.\n\nI have no clue why Fox Sports has cut it off at the knees, save the possibility its new owners, the British-based DAZN, intend to channel more foreign content to this small outpost on the other side of the planet at the expense of local content.\n\nThe Back Page team, Christmas drinks, circa 1998. Back row: Peter Frilingos, Keeley Devery, Billy Birmingham. Front row: Mike Gibson, Saul Shtein, Peter FitzSimons.\n\nBut I digress. For my obit, let me focus a little on the first decade, when The Back Page proved the antithesis of Thompson\u2019s dictum. It was a terrific show because we all really liked each other, and were close friends well beyond whatever we put to air.\n\nThe show was the idea of the veteran sports producer Saul Shtein. Knowing that Mike Gibson, the iconic sports broadcaster from Wide World of Sports, would be at the Atlanta Olympics at the same time as me, Saul asked me to duchess him on the idea of the show, after Mike had politely rejected his first approach. Mike and I got together one day at the beach volleyball, when Australia had just got the gold medal, and I pitched again.",

    "text": "According to its most recent annual report, between 2023 and 2024 FBi\u2019s operating deficit jumped sixfold, from $41,000 to $276,000 on a $1.6 million budget. Sponsorship revenue fell by $184,000 in the same period. Between 2021 and 2024 station membership declined by 36 per cent. FBi president Angela Stengel pointed to investments in the station\u2019s digital presence, as well as declining sponsorships and memberships to explain the jump in the deficit. Stengel says the fall in sponsorships was tied to economic pain being felt by \u201ccultural organisations, hospitality, and other community-based groups\u201d, which make up a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of partners. The financial struggles faced by the station are not new. In 2009, FBi ran a campaign targeting Virgin Group billionaire Richard Branson, seeking a million-dollar donation to support the struggling station. The campaign resulted in an interview with Branson, in which host Alison Piotrowski requested the funds live on air. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the million from Branson, but we did live to fight on, and fight hard. I just hope FBi is able to do it again,\u201d says Piotrowski, who went on to serve as Nine\u2019s US correspondent, and is now a senior reporter for the network and presenter on Weekend Today*.\n\n\u201cFBi gave me the opportunity to find my voice, but most importantly it gave me the space to make mistakes on air, to fail \u2026 and I became a better broadcaster as a result,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I look around the industry today there are very few places that nurture young talent, give them communities and networks for their future careers, and provide on-the-job experience without a paid internship \u2013 which just isn\u2019t realistic for most music and media companies.\u201d Journalists Alison Piotrowski and Marc Fennell both got their start at FBi Radio. Credit: Instagram and SBS Another darling of the station\u2019s alumni is globetrotting journalist and presenter of SBS\u2019s Mastermind, Marc Fennell, who got his start at FBi as the station\u2019s film critic. He said the station \u201cutterly and completely changed\u201d his life. \u201cI was a 17-year-old who walked in the door with no skills, I didn\u2019t know anybody that worked in media, music, culture \u2026 they genuinely taught me broadcasting from scratch,\u201d says Fennell, who later met his wife at the station.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible place for creativity. You can come, there\u2019s equipment there, you can play, you can create new things, you can try new things. I think having environments were people can play and find partnerships is really crucial. Without those spaces, we become much poorer as listeners, as a community, as a city.\u201d Loading Fennell says in the 22 years FBi had been on the air, social media had fundamentally changed the way people start media careers. He says, however, the emphasis on teamwork and the focus on audience were crucial elements that were reinforced by training in the station environment. \u201cIn radio and television and publishing it\u2019s extraordinarily rare to do anything by yourself. What you have to learn is how to work in teams and find your tribe. I work now with people that I met at FBi because of the creative partnerships we formed back then,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem very obvious, but that\u2019s actually a crucial component to what FBi offers. It creates creative partnerships that have now proliferated what people watch, what people read, what people listen to \u2026 if you take that away from Sydney, in particular, you end up with a very different-sounding media that I don\u2019t think serves the audience.\u201d\n\nNewly minted managing director Tyson Koh, who made a name for himself by leading the Keep Sydney Open movement during the city\u2019s controversial lockout law period, has been tasked with keeping the station afloat \u2013 a job he says is both exciting and daunting. Exciting because of FBi\u2019s cultural importance in Australia\u2019s music scene; daunting because \u201cthe station is going through a tough time, and it\u2019s been a struggle to get the message out\u201d. Managing director Tyson Koh said it had been \u201ca struggle to get the message out\u201d on the station\u2019s financial hardship. Credit: Sam Mooy \u201cWhilst the station has been around for a long time, it relies on people\u2019s financial support in order to stay on the air. Especially with a new generation of community radio listeners who might not be aware of the model that FBi operates under,\u201d says Koh, who first volunteered for the station in 1999, before it had a broadcasting license. Koh says that FBi\u2019s financial issues are reflective of a \u201cwider struggle\u201d creatives and art lovers are experiencing across the city.\n\n\u201cPeople these days are overextended with their financial obligations, whether it\u2019s rent or mortgages, but also the litany of subscriptions that we\u2019re being funnelled towards on a daily basis. I think what I would like people to be aware of is that FBi isn\u2019t a multinational tech company. It\u2019s an organisation that has a very tangible effect on the cultural life in Sydney,\u201d says Koh. Loading FBi was an early champion of Australian artists Flume, the Kid Laroi, Nina Las Vegas and Genesis Owusu, and there is concern among the station\u2019s faithful that a weakening of the business may hurt upcoming talent. With ongoing costs such as rent, broadcasting fees and staffing expenses continuing to pinch FBi\u2019s bottom line, Koh said that \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d in ensuring the station\u2019s sustainability. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had to make staff redundant, unfortunately, earlier in the year. So we\u2019re doing the best that we can to tighten our belts \u2026 we do need to look at our revenue model and see what can be developed and what can be improved, and we\u2019re doing all those things.\u201d",

    "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s around, \u2018how can he make it work?\u2019 I don\u2019t know what that would mean around his Wallabies place and what he wants to do. There\u2019s still two seasons to go before he has to play in the World Cup. If he wants to put that at jeopardy, it\u2019s all those things. I haven\u2019t spoken to him. He\u2019s definitely someone of interest to us if he\u2019s available. Ardie Savea won the Super Rugby Pacific MVP award this year at Moana Pasifika. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI don\u2019t know how many pigs I\u2019d have to get to try and get him over there.\u201d Tupou moving to a New Zealand club would not rule out involvement for the Wallabies at the 2027 Rugby World Cup. RA have the \u201cGiteau Law\u201d for offshore player selection, but Phil Waugh has previously indicated Australian players in New Zealand, like James O\u2019Connor at the Crusaders, would be automatically eligible anyway, given they\u2019re still playing in Super Rugby. Moana Pasifika\u2019s deliberate, and deep, connection to Pacific Island culture might suit Tupou, as it did with Savea, said Umaga.\n\nSekope Kepu was the first captain of Moana Pasifika. Credit: Getty \u201cSekope Kepu and Christian Lealiifano were two of the pillars of our club, who started a lot of that (cultural connection) off. We\u2019re just continuing with that work,\u201d Umaga said. \u201cI think I might just make a few calls after this.\u201d Kepu, who played with Tupou at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, was asked about the prospect of his former teammate playing at Moana Pasifika earlier in the year. \u201cHe\u2019d definitely fit right in and he\u2019ll inspire guys if he was to go there, definitely,\u201d Kepu said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to break the bank to get him over there.\n\nLoading \u201cI think he loves Oz and he\u2019s shown that with his decision to move over there from a young age. I hope that he can actually just play like he knows he can and just enjoy himself. I know when he\u2019s happy, he plays well. It\u2019d be massive for Moana if he was to go over there, but I think he\u2019s happier in Oz.\u201d Umaga and Kepu are both assistant coaches for the First Nations & Pasifika XV, who will play against the Lions in Melbourne on July 22. \u2018I don\u2019t lose sleep about it\u2019: Tana Umaga on two decades of O\u2019Driscoll controversy Tana Umaga probably doesn\u2019t realise that Wednesday marks two decades to the day since he and Keven Mealamu hoisted Lions captain Brian O\u2019Driscoll aloft in a ruck and unleashed a cyclone of controversy.\n\nWhen you are reminded about the incident every couple of weeks \u2013 and every couple of days, when a Lions tour rolls around \u2013 the passing years merge into a blur. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do about it. I don\u2019t lose sleep about it,\u201d Umaga said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that keeps coming up, and you can\u2019t do much about that.\u201d The infamous incident, which if you\u2019re Irish barely needs recapping, occurred in the first minute of the first Test of the Lions tour of New Zealand in 2005. At an early ruck, All Blacks stars Umaga and Mealamu attempted to clean O\u2019Driscoll out of the way, but it all went wrong. The legs of the Irish superstar were lifted and \u201cBOD\u201d speared down into the ground, dislocating his shoulder and ended his tour.\n\nThe All Blacks went on to thump the Lions 3-0 and the controversy around O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s foul play injury raged. And raged and raged and raged. Neither All Black player received any punishment, and amid a tsunami of outrage, Umaga became public enemy No.1 in Ireland and Britain. His face was even on a T-shirt: \u201cWanted: For the Assassination of Brian O\u2019Driscoll\u201d. Thirteen years later, in 2018, the pair finally made peace over dinner in Ireland, ahead of a promotional shoot for Guinness, where they spoke about having finally left it behind them. \u201cI\u2019ve been back to Ireland a couple of times, quite a few times, and I\u2019ve had no issues,\u201d Umaga said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a pretty small number [who are still upset] because, as I said, no one mentions it to me when I\u2019m there. I suppose with the advent of social media, that\u2019s what keeps it alive. And the meaning as well.\n\n\u201cAll of us have moved forward on it. It\u2019s part of the rugby fabric now. The British and Irish Lions are such a formidable team. This is etched in the memory and the fabric of that team. I\u2019m connected to that. \u201cPeople are passionate about their team, about right and wrong and what they feel should have happened. But yeah, 20 years later, we\u2019ve dealt with it many moons ago. \u201cNo doubt we\u2019ll catch up when we\u2019re both together in Melbourne. We\u2019ll just have another laugh about it, as we always do.\u201d Umaga will see O\u2019Driscoll when the Lions circus rolls into Victoria next month, having signed on to coach against them next month as an assistant for the First Nations and Pasifika XV at Melbourne\u2019s Marvel Stadium on July 22.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time \u2013 Umaga coached the Auckland Blues against the Lions on their 2017 tour of New Zealand \u2013 but the opportunity to be an assistant to head coach Toutai Kefu was worth another wearying round of interviews on that 2005 moment. Moana Pasifika coach Tana Umaga looks on during the round 14 Super Rugby Pacific match between Moana Pasifika and Blues. Credit: Getty Images Umaga, who now coaches Moana Pasifika in Super Rugby Pacific, will be on a staff also containing Glen Ella, Sekope Kepu and Simon Raiwalui. \u201cWhen I got the request, I didn\u2019t have to think about it too long \u2013 I thought it was a huge honour,\u201d Umaga said. \u201cYou see who else is involved in that coaching group. You know, there\u2019s a lot of people that I respect. Glen Ella \u2013 I was a fan of his when I was growing up, so I\u2019m looking forward to learning something off him and trying to bring back some of the 80s rugby that he played with his brothers, and those Wallaby days.\u201d\n\nThe First Nations and Pasifika XV was created to fill the empty slot left when the Rebels shut down last year, and will feature not only Australian players with First Nations and Pacific Island heritage, but likely a handful from the Moana and Fijian Drua sides as well. Umaga said it was a rare opportunity for some players to face the Lions. \u201cNot everyone gets it. It [a Lions tour] is held in such a high esteem,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some, they may never usually get that opportunity, like not just the First Nations and Pacific Island players in Australia, but the possibility of Drua players as well as some Moana Pasifika players. That\u2019ll be huge for those individuals if they get that chance.\u201d Loading",

    "text": "A full\u2011time worker on the minimum wage has just $33 spare each week after rent, food and transport, according to a new report.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglicare Australia's 2025 Cost of Living Index, released on Thursday, also said a single parent would have $1 left, even after government assistance, while a two\u2011income family with two children is left with only $5.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis examined how far the minimum wage would stretch when covering essential weekly costs like rent, food, transport, childcare and education.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Household Expenditure Survey and rent costs from SQM Research's Weekly Rent Report, it compared these expenses to a full-time worker\u2019s take-home pay of $822 a week from 1 July, when the latest minimum wage increase takes effect .\n\n\n\n\n\nA separate example included government support available to single parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report, Anglicare says, shows that \"full-time work no longer guarantees a decent standard of living\", with minimum wage workers \"being pushed to the brink\".\n\n\n\nAnglicare executive director Kasy Chambers labelled the results of this year's index as \"bleak\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After paying for the basics, minimum\u2011wage workers are left with almost nothing. In many cases, there's no money left for energy bills at all,\" Chambers said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing more people trapped in energy debt. They are skipping meals, going without heating, and falling behind on bills they'll never be able to repay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 330,000 customers owed a combined $300 million to energy retailers and debts above $3,000 were \"surging\", Chambers said, referencing the Australian Energy Regulator's 2024 annual retail markets report.\n\n\n\nPayment plans unsustainable, Anglicare says\n\nChambers said many people are locked into payment plans they cannot sustain, \"even though energy retailers are making record profits\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAnglicare says it wants more energy debt relief for people in hardship and governments to better regulate what it says is \"the gauging of energy costs\".\n\n\n\n\"Energy is not a luxury. It is essential to running a household, staying healthy, and living with dignity,\" Chambers said.\n\n\n\nChanges are coming, but not until next year\n\nRule changes announced by the Australian Energy Market Commission earlier this month will stop retailers from raising prices more than once a year, ban most late\u2011payment penalties and require companies to move vulnerable customers onto their best available deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reforms are meant to stop retailers from \"luring customers in with cheap deals, only to move them onto higher-cost plans\", Energy Minister Chris Bowen said last week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are many, many Australians, either in hardship or not in hardship, who aren't on their best possible plan. That's not their fault. We need to make it as easy as possible for them to change,\" Bowen told ABC Radio National.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government also extended energy bill relief as part of its March federal budget .\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery residence and one million small businesses across the nation will receive a $75 quarterly rebate automatically applied to their electricity bill from 1 July until the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\nOn a Sunday earlier this month, Ben Williamson and Tyron Simon sat on a patch of grass and looked across James Street. It was Agnes Bakery\u2019s final day of trade. \u201cI brought the kids and the family and the dogs down, and then Ty came down and we got a couple of pastries and a coffee and sat and just looked at it,\u201d Williamson says. Idle opened on Merthyr Road last weekend. Markus Ravik Until that moment, the celebrated chef hadn\u2019t considered what the closure of Agnes Bakery meant to him and what came to be known as Anyday, the restaurant group he co-owns with Simon, Bianca Marchi and Frank Li.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe started talking about it and it all kind of hit me,\u201d Williamson says, \u201c\u2018Man, what a journey to get to this point.\u2019 \u201d Related Article Brisbane\u2019s best chook sanger? Here\u2019s a textural, flavour-filled contender Agnes Bakery started as a hail Mary \u2013 an unfettered dice roll in the face of a global pandemic. This was back in the final week of March in 2020 in the Spring Hill premises of Agnes the restaurant, which had been due to open the same week. Seemingly against the odds, it was a hit, with locked-down punters queueing around the block for woodfired bread and pastries (and perhaps a little human interaction outside of their own four walls). Unlike its predecessor, Agnes Bakery, Idle is a full-service cafe. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen lockdown restrictions eased and the group geared up to open Agnes as a restaurant, it made sense to move the bakery to its own space on the corner of James and Harcourt streets. There, it established itself as a local favourite, with the lines this time stretching down the hill towards The Calile hotel. In the meantime, Williamson, Simon, Li and Marchi had opened Bianca on Ada Lane, opposite The Calile, which became another roaring success, and then went on to formalise their identity as Anyday. Behind the counter, regulars will find all the breads and pastries they\u2019ve become accustomed to queueing for at Agnes Bakery. Markus Ravik So the word \u201cjourney\u201d feels appropriate. When Agnes Bakery wrapped at the end of that Sunday, the staff would begin the process of packing down and migrating over to Merthyr Road in New Farm to Idle, its full-service successor, which opened last weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich makes you wonder: why call time on this little bakery (or brand, perhaps) that could, which has come to mean so much to so many people, not least of all Williamson, Simon, Li and Marchi themselves? Harissa egg danish. Markus Ravik \u201cIt had sort of become its own thing anyway,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cEspecially when Mitch [Suchowacki] came on board as head baker. It really started to evolve. \u201cIt was like this little sibling constantly living in the shadow of Agnes [the restaurant], which had become such a beast of its own that it didn\u2019t make sense any more to keep them connected. So this was a great opportunity for us to give it its own identity.\u201d If the closure of Agnes Bakery is the end of one chapter, Idle is the start of another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater this year, Anyday will open a clutch of venues in the heritage-listed Coal Board Building in the guts of Brisbane\u2019s CBD. It will be the group\u2019s most ambitious project yet. Idle sourdough crumpets with creme fraiche and berry compote. Markus Ravik In that sense, Idle feels like something of a test run. When this masthead visits on a busy Tuesday morning, Williamson, Simon and Marchi are all there, overseeing service, and running food to the al fresco tables lined along Merthyr Road and up a brick-lined side lane. The tables are gathered around an indoor service area designed by Tamsin Johnson, best known locally for her work on Raes on Watego and the Sir boutique on James Street. She\u2019s given the venue a light and bright treatment, with plenty of stainless-steel and custom terrazzo, the standout feature some Italian futurist light fittings. It feels sleek and modern without drifting into the austere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdle features a design by in-demand Tamsin Johnson. Markus Ravik Idle serves everything regulars have become accustomed to at Agnes Bakery \u2013 fire-licked sourdough loaves, Basque cheesecakes, caneles, kouign-amanns and so on \u2013 but also a relatively expansive brunch menu designed by Williamson Suchowacki. There are your usual cafe go-tos given an Idle twist: sourdough crumpets with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and a berry compote, porridge with white miso, cinnamon poached quince, coconut and walnut, and a bacon and fried egg roll with waffle fries and relish. \u201cWe started talking about it and it all kind of hit me: \u2018Man, what a journey to get to this point.\u2019 \u201d Idle co-owner Ben Williamson But there\u2019s also more elevated dishes such as Baghdad eggs with a cumin burnt butter, smoked almond, a flaky flatbread and mint; a steamed spanner crab omelette with chilli, choron (a tomato-spiked b\u00e9arnaise), salmon roe and toast; and a continental-style breakfast with ham, asiago, house-made butter, and a cucumber and fennel pickle, served with a baguette and soft-boiled egg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all about as thoughtful as you\u2019d expect from Anyday, and from 11am, free-range charcoal chicken, fries, and daily salads and sandwiches are added to the mix. Beyond pastries and brunch, Idle stocks a bunch of pantry items on its back wall. Markus Ravik Idle serves specialty coffee by Single O, and shelving on the back wall stocks a bunch of pantry items including wine, house-made granola and condiments, and fancy Torres potato chips from Spain. Beyond its meaning for Anyday, Idle is a welcome addition in New Farm but also the city generally, where full-service cafe openings have become increasingly rare in the post-pandemic age. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of Agnes Bakery clientele coming down, but also a lot of locals, who are often people in their 50s and 60s,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cWe thought it might be a challenge to get some of [them] across the line, but they\u2019ve responded well. It\u2019s been really great.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpen Mon-Sun 7am-2pm. 84 Merthyr Road, New Farm, (07) 3062 2346. anyday.com.au\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

    "text": "But there are many exceptions. One of them was The Back Page, the sports panel show which has finished up this week after a 29-year run. As one who was on it for its first decade and a bitty, I have been inundated with emails, texts and calls this week, from those lamenting its demise.\n\n\u201cIt is normally perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench through the heart of the journalism industry, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs, for no good reason. Which is more or less true. For the most part, they are dirty little animals with huge brains and no pulse.\u201d\n\nInevitably, many of the obits have focused on its latter years \u2013 which is fair enough because, to my amazement, it has been bloody successful for the last two decades, too, and really was a great show. With its latter-day incarnation hosted by Tony Squires and boasting panellists such as Crash Craddock, Adam Spencer and Candice Warner, the thing was still working and doing great box office.\n\nI have no clue why Fox Sports has cut it off at the knees, save the possibility its new owners, the British-based DAZN, intend to channel more foreign content to this small outpost on the other side of the planet at the expense of local content.\n\nThe Back Page team, Christmas drinks, circa 1998. Back row: Peter Frilingos, Keeley Devery, Billy Birmingham. Front row: Mike Gibson, Saul Shtein, Peter FitzSimons.\n\nBut I digress. For my obit, let me focus a little on the first decade, when The Back Page proved the antithesis of Thompson\u2019s dictum. It was a terrific show because we all really liked each other, and were close friends well beyond whatever we put to air.\n\nThe show was the idea of the veteran sports producer Saul Shtein. Knowing that Mike Gibson, the iconic sports broadcaster from Wide World of Sports, would be at the Atlanta Olympics at the same time as me, Saul asked me to duchess him on the idea of the show, after Mike had politely rejected his first approach. Mike and I got together one day at the beach volleyball, when Australia had just got the gold medal, and I pitched again.",

    "text": "According to its most recent annual report, between 2023 and 2024 FBi\u2019s operating deficit jumped sixfold, from $41,000 to $276,000 on a $1.6 million budget. Sponsorship revenue fell by $184,000 in the same period. Between 2021 and 2024 station membership declined by 36 per cent. FBi president Angela Stengel pointed to investments in the station\u2019s digital presence, as well as declining sponsorships and memberships to explain the jump in the deficit. Stengel says the fall in sponsorships was tied to economic pain being felt by \u201ccultural organisations, hospitality, and other community-based groups\u201d, which make up a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of partners. The financial struggles faced by the station are not new. In 2009, FBi ran a campaign targeting Virgin Group billionaire Richard Branson, seeking a million-dollar donation to support the struggling station. The campaign resulted in an interview with Branson, in which host Alison Piotrowski requested the funds live on air. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the million from Branson, but we did live to fight on, and fight hard. I just hope FBi is able to do it again,\u201d says Piotrowski, who went on to serve as Nine\u2019s US correspondent, and is now a senior reporter for the network and presenter on Weekend Today*.\n\n\u201cFBi gave me the opportunity to find my voice, but most importantly it gave me the space to make mistakes on air, to fail \u2026 and I became a better broadcaster as a result,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I look around the industry today there are very few places that nurture young talent, give them communities and networks for their future careers, and provide on-the-job experience without a paid internship \u2013 which just isn\u2019t realistic for most music and media companies.\u201d Journalists Alison Piotrowski and Marc Fennell both got their start at FBi Radio. Credit: Instagram and SBS Another darling of the station\u2019s alumni is globetrotting journalist and presenter of SBS\u2019s Mastermind, Marc Fennell, who got his start at FBi as the station\u2019s film critic. He said the station \u201cutterly and completely changed\u201d his life. \u201cI was a 17-year-old who walked in the door with no skills, I didn\u2019t know anybody that worked in media, music, culture \u2026 they genuinely taught me broadcasting from scratch,\u201d says Fennell, who later met his wife at the station.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible place for creativity. You can come, there\u2019s equipment there, you can play, you can create new things, you can try new things. I think having environments were people can play and find partnerships is really crucial. Without those spaces, we become much poorer as listeners, as a community, as a city.\u201d Loading Fennell says in the 22 years FBi had been on the air, social media had fundamentally changed the way people start media careers. He says, however, the emphasis on teamwork and the focus on audience were crucial elements that were reinforced by training in the station environment. \u201cIn radio and television and publishing it\u2019s extraordinarily rare to do anything by yourself. What you have to learn is how to work in teams and find your tribe. I work now with people that I met at FBi because of the creative partnerships we formed back then,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem very obvious, but that\u2019s actually a crucial component to what FBi offers. It creates creative partnerships that have now proliferated what people watch, what people read, what people listen to \u2026 if you take that away from Sydney, in particular, you end up with a very different-sounding media that I don\u2019t think serves the audience.\u201d\n\nNewly minted managing director Tyson Koh, who made a name for himself by leading the Keep Sydney Open movement during the city\u2019s controversial lockout law period, has been tasked with keeping the station afloat \u2013 a job he says is both exciting and daunting. Exciting because of FBi\u2019s cultural importance in Australia\u2019s music scene; daunting because \u201cthe station is going through a tough time, and it\u2019s been a struggle to get the message out\u201d. Managing director Tyson Koh said it had been \u201ca struggle to get the message out\u201d on the station\u2019s financial hardship. Credit: Sam Mooy \u201cWhilst the station has been around for a long time, it relies on people\u2019s financial support in order to stay on the air. Especially with a new generation of community radio listeners who might not be aware of the model that FBi operates under,\u201d says Koh, who first volunteered for the station in 1999, before it had a broadcasting license. Koh says that FBi\u2019s financial issues are reflective of a \u201cwider struggle\u201d creatives and art lovers are experiencing across the city.\n\n\u201cPeople these days are overextended with their financial obligations, whether it\u2019s rent or mortgages, but also the litany of subscriptions that we\u2019re being funnelled towards on a daily basis. I think what I would like people to be aware of is that FBi isn\u2019t a multinational tech company. It\u2019s an organisation that has a very tangible effect on the cultural life in Sydney,\u201d says Koh. Loading FBi was an early champion of Australian artists Flume, the Kid Laroi, Nina Las Vegas and Genesis Owusu, and there is concern among the station\u2019s faithful that a weakening of the business may hurt upcoming talent. With ongoing costs such as rent, broadcasting fees and staffing expenses continuing to pinch FBi\u2019s bottom line, Koh said that \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d in ensuring the station\u2019s sustainability. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had to make staff redundant, unfortunately, earlier in the year. So we\u2019re doing the best that we can to tighten our belts \u2026 we do need to look at our revenue model and see what can be developed and what can be improved, and we\u2019re doing all those things.\u201d",

    "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s around, \u2018how can he make it work?\u2019 I don\u2019t know what that would mean around his Wallabies place and what he wants to do. There\u2019s still two seasons to go before he has to play in the World Cup. If he wants to put that at jeopardy, it\u2019s all those things. I haven\u2019t spoken to him. He\u2019s definitely someone of interest to us if he\u2019s available. Ardie Savea won the Super Rugby Pacific MVP award this year at Moana Pasifika. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI don\u2019t know how many pigs I\u2019d have to get to try and get him over there.\u201d Tupou moving to a New Zealand club would not rule out involvement for the Wallabies at the 2027 Rugby World Cup. RA have the \u201cGiteau Law\u201d for offshore player selection, but Phil Waugh has previously indicated Australian players in New Zealand, like James O\u2019Connor at the Crusaders, would be automatically eligible anyway, given they\u2019re still playing in Super Rugby. Moana Pasifika\u2019s deliberate, and deep, connection to Pacific Island culture might suit Tupou, as it did with Savea, said Umaga.\n\nSekope Kepu was the first captain of Moana Pasifika. Credit: Getty \u201cSekope Kepu and Christian Lealiifano were two of the pillars of our club, who started a lot of that (cultural connection) off. We\u2019re just continuing with that work,\u201d Umaga said. \u201cI think I might just make a few calls after this.\u201d Kepu, who played with Tupou at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, was asked about the prospect of his former teammate playing at Moana Pasifika earlier in the year. \u201cHe\u2019d definitely fit right in and he\u2019ll inspire guys if he was to go there, definitely,\u201d Kepu said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to break the bank to get him over there.\n\nLoading \u201cI think he loves Oz and he\u2019s shown that with his decision to move over there from a young age. I hope that he can actually just play like he knows he can and just enjoy himself. I know when he\u2019s happy, he plays well. It\u2019d be massive for Moana if he was to go over there, but I think he\u2019s happier in Oz.\u201d Umaga and Kepu are both assistant coaches for the First Nations & Pasifika XV, who will play against the Lions in Melbourne on July 22. \u2018I don\u2019t lose sleep about it\u2019: Tana Umaga on two decades of O\u2019Driscoll controversy Tana Umaga probably doesn\u2019t realise that Wednesday marks two decades to the day since he and Keven Mealamu hoisted Lions captain Brian O\u2019Driscoll aloft in a ruck and unleashed a cyclone of controversy.\n\nWhen you are reminded about the incident every couple of weeks \u2013 and every couple of days, when a Lions tour rolls around \u2013 the passing years merge into a blur. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do about it. I don\u2019t lose sleep about it,\u201d Umaga said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that keeps coming up, and you can\u2019t do much about that.\u201d The infamous incident, which if you\u2019re Irish barely needs recapping, occurred in the first minute of the first Test of the Lions tour of New Zealand in 2005. At an early ruck, All Blacks stars Umaga and Mealamu attempted to clean O\u2019Driscoll out of the way, but it all went wrong. The legs of the Irish superstar were lifted and \u201cBOD\u201d speared down into the ground, dislocating his shoulder and ended his tour.\n\nThe All Blacks went on to thump the Lions 3-0 and the controversy around O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s foul play injury raged. And raged and raged and raged. Neither All Black player received any punishment, and amid a tsunami of outrage, Umaga became public enemy No.1 in Ireland and Britain. His face was even on a T-shirt: \u201cWanted: For the Assassination of Brian O\u2019Driscoll\u201d. Thirteen years later, in 2018, the pair finally made peace over dinner in Ireland, ahead of a promotional shoot for Guinness, where they spoke about having finally left it behind them. \u201cI\u2019ve been back to Ireland a couple of times, quite a few times, and I\u2019ve had no issues,\u201d Umaga said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a pretty small number [who are still upset] because, as I said, no one mentions it to me when I\u2019m there. I suppose with the advent of social media, that\u2019s what keeps it alive. And the meaning as well.\n\n\u201cAll of us have moved forward on it. It\u2019s part of the rugby fabric now. The British and Irish Lions are such a formidable team. This is etched in the memory and the fabric of that team. I\u2019m connected to that. \u201cPeople are passionate about their team, about right and wrong and what they feel should have happened. But yeah, 20 years later, we\u2019ve dealt with it many moons ago. \u201cNo doubt we\u2019ll catch up when we\u2019re both together in Melbourne. We\u2019ll just have another laugh about it, as we always do.\u201d Umaga will see O\u2019Driscoll when the Lions circus rolls into Victoria next month, having signed on to coach against them next month as an assistant for the First Nations and Pasifika XV at Melbourne\u2019s Marvel Stadium on July 22.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time \u2013 Umaga coached the Auckland Blues against the Lions on their 2017 tour of New Zealand \u2013 but the opportunity to be an assistant to head coach Toutai Kefu was worth another wearying round of interviews on that 2005 moment. Moana Pasifika coach Tana Umaga looks on during the round 14 Super Rugby Pacific match between Moana Pasifika and Blues. Credit: Getty Images Umaga, who now coaches Moana Pasifika in Super Rugby Pacific, will be on a staff also containing Glen Ella, Sekope Kepu and Simon Raiwalui. \u201cWhen I got the request, I didn\u2019t have to think about it too long \u2013 I thought it was a huge honour,\u201d Umaga said. \u201cYou see who else is involved in that coaching group. You know, there\u2019s a lot of people that I respect. Glen Ella \u2013 I was a fan of his when I was growing up, so I\u2019m looking forward to learning something off him and trying to bring back some of the 80s rugby that he played with his brothers, and those Wallaby days.\u201d\n\nThe First Nations and Pasifika XV was created to fill the empty slot left when the Rebels shut down last year, and will feature not only Australian players with First Nations and Pacific Island heritage, but likely a handful from the Moana and Fijian Drua sides as well. Umaga said it was a rare opportunity for some players to face the Lions. \u201cNot everyone gets it. It [a Lions tour] is held in such a high esteem,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some, they may never usually get that opportunity, like not just the First Nations and Pacific Island players in Australia, but the possibility of Drua players as well as some Moana Pasifika players. That\u2019ll be huge for those individuals if they get that chance.\u201d Loading",

    "text": "A Melbourne man in a wheelchair couldn't access his apartment when the lift was broken down overnight and he was forced to pay for a hotel room.\n\nShane Hryhorec was forced to pay for overnight accommodation after he was unable to access his home. Source: Supplied & GoogleMaps\n\nAfter a long day at work, most Aussies just desperately want to get home and switch off. But for one Melbourne man, he simply couldn't. Instead, he was stranded outside his home and forced to fork out $230 for overnight accommodation \u2014 all because the lift was out of service.\n\n\"Long story short, I saw in our residential Facebook group that the lift had broken down. I called the lift company to let them know that I'm in a wheelchair and I need to get into my building. They said it had already been logged and someone was on their way,\" Shane Hryhorec told Yahoo News. \"But I didn't hear anything back, and when I got home at 9.30 pm, the lift was out, no signs and no communication.\n\n\"I had to book a hotel and wear the same clothes for two days.\"\n\nDespite constantly communicating with lift company Schindler, very little information was allegedly given to Shane regarding access to his home. He was eventually able to get in the following evening, but was then stuck inside his apartment as further repair work was carried out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The next day they confirmed the lift was working and they let me into my apartment. They then had to continue working on it, which meant I couldn't then leave the building until it was resolved,\" he said, raising concerns about safety.\n\nGroceries 'ditched' after Aussie couldn't access home\n\nOn top of the $230 hotel fee, Shane had to also throw out the majority of his weekly shop he had bought the day he was unable to access his home.\n\n\"The other thing that really upset me is I had gone shopping, so all $60 worth of food that needed to go in the fridge was ditched,\" he said. \"Dairy and meat products had to go in the bin.\"\n\nDespite being a member of his building's strata committee and speaking to the lift company, Shane feels defeated knowing there is no avenue in which he can claim compensation for all the money he had to spend due to the incident.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"What compensation is there for people with disabilities who get trapped in the lift but also can't get inside their building and have to book accommodation? None,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what happened to me and I'm still out of pocket,\" he said, adding that while this is the first time he's required overnight accommodation, the lift has broken down many times during the seven years he's lived in the building.\n\nShane claims the lift frequently breaks down. Source: Supplied\n\nLift company respond to Aussie being stranded outside home\n\nSchindler's Regional General Manager Callum Joyce told Yahoo News the company \"continuously works to minimise elevator outages\" and \"understands the critical nature of elevators for mobility throughout residential buildings, especially buildings with a single elevator.\"\n\nHe claims the lift had not broken down and instead the repairs were planned with the building's strata company.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"During the planned upgrade, a part failed, which required replacement,\" he said, explaining this is why the lift was out of order overnight.\n\n\"The part was sourced from our warehouse in NSW, air-freighted overnight and delivered to site Friday morning... We provided regular updates and continued to communicate the status of the repair through to its completion,\" he said.\n\nDisabled Aussies continue to be 'overlooked'\n\nThe incident is much more than a residential building simply needing repairs, Megan Spindler-Smith, the Deputy CEO of People with Disability Australia told Yahoo News. It's an everyday situation, and impacts ripple far and wide for those living with a disability.\n\n\"Sadly, this isn\u2019t the first time we've heard of people with disability \u2014 including wheelchair users \u2014 being overlooked during emergencies. Lifts break down and things go wrong, but that\u2019s exactly why buildings must have effective, inclusive plans in place,\" she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Everyone has the basic human right to access their home \u2014 or, at the very least, be provided with safe and reasonable alternatives.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?
