    "text": "Chances are you've been to a third place at least once in your life and didn't even realise.\n\nEssentially public lounge rooms, they are social environments separate from home (first place) and work (second place).\n\nAnd while many believe they're essential, some experts say they're becoming a lot more scarce. So what are they, and are they going anywhere? \ufeff\n\nA third place could be anywhere from a coffee shop to a park. (Sydney Morning Herald)\n\nThe term \"third place\" was coined in the 1990s by \ufeffsociologist Ray Oldenburg as work hours began to increase.\ufeff\n\nHe argued that as life became busier and more secluded, these places became vital for democracy, engagement and a sense of place amongst the broader community.\ufeff\n\nThe main criteria for a spot to be a third place are pretty simple: it needs to be a neutral area that is easily accessible to and comfortable for the public.\n\nIts main purpose is for people to gather and socialise, fostering a sense of community and conversation. \ufeff\n\nREAD MORE: Three words this CEO swears will help you land a better job \ufeff\n\nThe main purpose of third spaces are to foster a sense of community with strangers. (Getty)\n\nIn a traditional sense, a third space can be anywhere from a coffee shop to a park to a library.\n\n\"Shopping centres are considered third spaces,\" creative producer at youth arts organisation OutLoud Nicole Issa said.\n\n\"Even though some people might not like it to be, it's the truth.\"\n\nShe says third places are important for social connections, particularly amongst young adults.\n\nShe also thinks they're dying out.\ufeff\n\n\"One thing that I'm hearing a lot from young people is that there is a need for third spaces and there's a need for safe places for young people to go,\" she said.\n\n\ufeff\"I think it's been a gradual thing. The biggest, major event that has changed the way young people use third space was definitely COVID...\n\nMany believe that shopping centres are also considered third place. (JOE ARMAO)\n\n\"There was like strict legislation that came in that prevented people from going to social events or even meeting up with other people, which then, in turn, just changed people's patterns.\"\n\nHowever, unlike Issa, University of Melbourne Chair of Architecture and Urban Design Kim Dovey does not believe that third spaces are dying, but rather that they never existed in Australia to begin with.\n\n\ufeff\"The concept of the third place is an American thing,\" he said.\n\n\"It sort of came out of that kind of social capital literature.\n\n\"These places are important because they're where we establish what are often known as weak ties.\n\n\"You make new friends and acquaintances, and you get to know your neighbourhood and your neighbours a bit more and people you wouldn't normally run into.\n\n\"In so many parts of the world, it's just normal everyday life. It didn't really need a name.\"\n\nThe emergence of social media has allowed for the growth of digital third places. (Getty)\n\nIn his literature, Ray Oldenburg argued that a place outside of work and home is crucial for public wellbeing.\n\n\"What suburbia cries for are the means for people to gather easily, inexpensively, regularly, and pleasurably - a 'place on the corner',\" he said.\n\nWhile brick-and-mortar shopping centres filled that need for decades, the rise of online shopping has meant people are spending less time at physical stores.\n\nThe internet \u2013 particularly social media \u2013 is a double-edged sword here. While it's given rise to digital third places, it's limited the way that people interact in public.\n\n\"I hate having to get out of the way of people who are reading their phone as they walk down the street, they're not actually present in the street,\" Professor Kim Dovey said.\n\n\"Cities work by putting lots of people you don't know into the same space that you share, and you weave in and out of each other and on busy pedestrian sidewalks.\"\n\n\"And that's how cities work, so I think social media is a threat to that.\"",

    "text": "Christmas couldn't come fast enough for the Australian bicycle industry, which has been buffeted by a post-pandemic slump.\n\nBike sales ballooned during the COVID-19 health emergency , with cycling one of the activities permitted during lockdowns.\n\nResearch by industry analysts IBISWorld shows bikes were then flying off the racks as Australians embraced the activity, spurring a jump in profits from 2020 to 2022.\n\nCycling remains popular in Australia, but the bike industry has recorded a slump in sales since the end of the pandemic. (Lydia Lynch)\n\nStock levels across Australia were soon strained and as the virus led to lockdowns and factory shutdowns in the key manufacturing hubs of China and Taiwan , they became exhausted.\ufeff\n\nBut then the brakes came on as the global economy kickstarted post-pandemic, with cost-of-living pressures making new bicycle purchases a low priority for households.\n\nOne bright spot has been continuing high demand for parts, accessories and repair services.\n\nBicycle Industries Australia chief executive Peter Bourke said retailers, manufacturers and importers were counting on \ufeffthe festive season this year.\n\n\"Christmas and the summer months have traditionally been our strongest periods ... the wrapped bicycle under the Christmas tree is still a popular present,\" he said.\n\nDemand for bicycles in Australia and other countries boomed during the pandemic but then quickly fell off. (AP)\n\nTraditional bike shops continue to hold advantages over online retailers, including expert fittings, personalised advice and a skilled repair service, but they face a shifting market. \ufeff\n\nOne example, highlighted by the IBISWorld research released in 2025, was Pedal Group's 99 Bikes chain of stores across Australia.\n\nThe company expanded rapidly, increasing its number of physical stores to boost its market share.\n\nBut since the close of the pandemic, slumping demand caused the company to deal with oversupply issues, hampering its expansion.\n\nAnd Australian cycle companies are not alone in facing a post-COVID sales slump.\n\nRemember Peloton? \ufeffThe sports company turned out millions of exercise bikes and treadmills fitted with smart technology, fuelled by demand from fitness enthusiasts who were confined to home.\n\nSales of Peloton fitness bikes boomed during the pandemic, but then fell off after lockdowns lifted. (Supplied)\n\nSales boomed during lockdowns, but Peloton's fortunes began to fade as vaccinations increased, gyms reopened and rivals offered competitive products.\n\nOnce the darling of the US stock market during COVID, by February 2022, its share price had collapsed and a painful company restructure followed, including shedding 2800 workers.\n\nThe rising popularity of e-bikes is also another challenge to sales of conventional, or analogue, bicycles.\n\n\ufeffThe technology is expanding the market by appealing to a wider range of consumers than conventional, or analogue, bikes, requiring less pedalling and easier hill-climbing.\n\nMany bike shops are now stocking e-bikes, but they've been competing with sales from private individuals and online suppliers, often spruiking powerful and illegally altered machines.\n\nE-bikes have provided both a threat and opportunity for conventional bike sales. (Jorens Seins/iStock)\n\nAustralian import regulations controls on e-bikes were relaxed in 2021, leading to a flood of such e-bikes capable of travelling at more than 50km/h.\n\nBut in December 2025, after a spate of deaths and serious injuries of e-bike riders, federal and state authorities agreed to reinstate a key import standard to define legal e-bikes.\n\nThis would include the motor cutting out at a maximum assisted speed of 25km/h. \ufeff\n\nLooking ahead, the hope is a safer and better-regulated market will create a level playing field for established bike dealers.\n\nBourke says the industry is adapting to the heady changes, but the traditional local bicycle store selling everything, from children's bikes with trainer wheels, to mountain bikes, commuter machines and racing cycles is probably on its way out.",

To refuse one is to refuse the other,\" Leo said during the solemn service.\n\nEarlier, he spoke in front of St Peter's Basilica to offer Christmas wishes and thank those who had come to follow the mass on outdoor screens, despite rainy weather.\n\n\"St Peter's is very large but unfortunately it is not large enough to receive all of you,\" he told the crowd of about 5,000.\n\nThe US-born pope has adopted a more discreet and moderate style to that of his charismatic predecessor Francis, who died on April 21.\n\nThe mass was attended by high-ranking Church figures, diplomats and about 6,000 faithful.\n\nPope Leo XIV's first Midnight Mass in St Peter's Basilica. (AP: Gregorio Borgia)\n\nLeo stuck to a very religious homily without any direct reference to current affairs.\n\nThe ceremony celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ and is one of the most important days in the Catholic Church calendar.\n\nThe service combines traditional music with symbolic gestures such as placing a statue of the baby Jesus in a cradle.\n\nThe 70-year-old pope decided to hold the mass at a later time than under the more elderly Francis, who would hold Christmas mass at around 7:30pm local time.\n\nIn another change, Leo will hold another mass on Christmas Day on Thursday, renewing a tradition started by the late pope John Paul II.\n\nPope Leo XIV will return to the basilica for Mass on Christmas Day followed by his traditional blessing from the loggia. (Reuters: Guglielmo Mangiapane)\n\nHe will then give his \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing at midday local time from the balcony of the basilica \u2014 during which popes usually speak about conflicts around the world and call for peace.\n\nLeo on Tuesday called for a global truce around the world on Christmas Day, expressing \"great sadness\" that \"apparently Russia rejected a request\" for one in Ukraine.\n\n\"I am renewing my request to all people of good will to respect a day of peace \u2014 at least on the feast of the birth of our saviour,\" Leo told reporters at his residence in Castel Gandolfo near Rome.\n\nChristmas 2025 also marks the end of the Catholic Church's Jubilee Holy Year, which has brought millions of pilgrims to Rome.\n\nCardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa arrives at the Church of the Nativity, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, on Christmas Eve. (AP: Ariel Schalit)\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of people flocked to Bethlehem's Manger Square after two years of subdued celebrations because of the war in Gaza.\n\nChristmas festivities return to Bethlehem after two years For the first time in two years, Bethlehem has restarted its Christmas festivities to \"reignite the spirit that everybody needs\" while Palestinians continue to live under restrictions.\n\nBethlehem, where Christians believe Jesus was born, had cancelled Christmas celebrations during the war.\n\nBut on Wednesday, local time, a giant Christmas tree was back in Manger Square, temporarily replacing the wartime nativity scene of baby Jesus surrounded by rubble and barbed wire in a homage to Gaza's suffering.\n\nCardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the top Catholic leader in the Holy Land, kicked off this year's celebrations during the traditional procession from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, calling for \"a Christmas full of light\".\n\nCardinal Pizzaballa said he came bearing greetings from Gaza's tiny Christian community, where he held a pre-Christmas Mass on Sunday.\n\nAFP/AP",

(Getty Images: Harry Engels)\n\n\"I think it's something that you don't get into too often \u2014 that sort of that state where everything just feels like it's clicking,\" Knight said.\n\n\"It's just real clarity in your thinking and clarity in decision-making.\n\n\"You're not thinking too much but you're thinking a little bit; you're thinking the right things.\n\n\"For me, as a batter, like your decision-making is really sharp. You almost feel like you know what the bowler's going to bowl and you just feel quite invincible, really.\n\n\"You execute the skill exactly how you want to: You middle the ball, hit it where you want to and it just feels quite easy and effortless and quite light.\"\n\nThe musician\n\nTim Levinson is better known by his stage name, Urthboy.\n\nHe's a founding member of the hip hop group, The Herd, and an acclaimed solo performer, with seven albums to his name.\n\nHe ran a record label, Elefant Traks, and produced and managed other musicians.\n\n\"Flow state's just deep work,\" Urthboy said.\n\n\"It really is just getting into a place where you have clarity, you have focus, you have a sense of some kind of coherent goal even if it's not a tangible thing.\n\n\"It's just you're moving and intellectually something about the wiring and the connecting of ideas and themes.\n\n\"There's a sort of fluidity between the steps along the way, so, there's less blockage; there's no second guessing; there's less stopping to think.\"\n\nThe runner\n\nJessica Stenson broke the Australian women's marathon record in Valencia in December.\n\nDuring the race she described being in a flow state.\n\nStenson won a Commonwealth Games gold medal and two bronze medals and competed in two Olympic Games.\n\n\"It [flow] has a bit of an air of effortlessness about it,\" Stenson said.\n\n\"So, you're obviously doing something that consumes a lot of energy and it's a difficult task, but at the time it just feels like it's coming really naturally.\n\n\"I think it's a state where your mind is very absorbed in the moment, and you obviously feel sensations, but you're not really hanging on to them or judging them.\n\n\"You're just experiencing the feelings and feeling at peace.\"\n\nFinding a cadence is hugely important for any long-distance event. (AP: Isaac Parkin/PA)\n\nThe mathematician\n\nProfessor Geordie Williamson is the director of the Sydney Mathematical Research Institute.\n\nHe's won international mathematical prizes and in 2018 became the youngest living Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\n\"You enter this beautiful state that's very fleeting, very difficult to attain, where you don't have a sense of time,\" Williamson said.\n\n\"You feel a complete kind of freedom within the problem, and it's often at those moments that really beautiful things can happen.\n\n\"Calculations are really hard for a while and then at some point you get such an ease with them that it just all fits together.\n\n\"It feels right and you know you're going in the right direction.\n\n\"Often I've found what I would kind of identify as flow states not whilst working with a pen and paper \u2014 like whilst walking around \u2014 and you feel this like very beautiful freedom in your mind, like all the pieces can just assemble as they should.\n\n\"It's completely addictive.\"\n\nThe performance psychologist\n\nCaroline Anderson has worked for two decades as a performance psychologist.\n\nMost recently she was the lead psychologist with the Australian Olympic team in Paris.\n\n\"I would describe flow as just that real task absorption and process focus where we're not thinking about consequences,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"There's less self-referential processing or thinking going on in the brain.\n\n\"We stop thinking about the pressure. The pressure is there, it's just that we're not choosing to focus on it, cause we're directing our focus towards other things.\"\n\nHow often do you experience flow?\n\nHeather Knight\n\nKnight scored 157 against Australia in the 2013 Ashes in one of the finest knocks of her career and looks at the innings as a prime example.\n\n\"Maybe a session I think where I really got into that flow,\" Knight said.\n\n\"Once or twice a season potentially across the whole year. So, that's a lot of cricket games that probably you're not in that state.\n\n\"I was able to think really clearly, move really freely. It's just when your body moves exactly how you want it to, you play the shots, you time the ball, you hit the ball where you want to.\"\n\nUrthboy\n\nUrthboy says flow is about clarity and focus. (Facebook: Urthboy)\n\nUrthboy feels flow most powerfully on stage.\n\n\"When you're performing \u2014 maybe there's a forgiveness for making mistakes of course \u2014 but you don't want to be getting into a spot where you're thinking at all,\" Urthboy said.\n\n\"In the studio you can be slow moving to that zone or you can be clarified in your thinking.\n\n\"It took me a long time to understand that you're a vehicle to some extent with the way that ideas flow through.\n\n\"It's not really that you have all this control and you have all the answers. It's more that there are things that are floating in the air and you're capturing them and you're able to weave them into your process.\n\n\"You're working with it as opposed to having control of it.\"\n\nJessica Stenson\n\nStenson finished 12th in the Paris Olympic Games marathon. (Getty Images: Christian Petersen)\n\nStenson hit a flow state during her 2022 Commonwealth Games gold medal run but it can still elude at key moments.\n\nShe didn't find it much at the Paris Olympics, despite still being happy with her performance, and can feel it powerfully away from athletics.\n\n\"Maybe two or three times a year. I would say, you know, maybe in a race maybe there are the odd training sessions, but it's a pretty rare feeling,\" Stenson said.\n\n\"[In Valencia] I didn't feel exhaustion, it was a pace or an effort I'd practised so often in training, and it felt like I was moving really efficiently, so, it almost felt like I was like floating across the ground.\n\n\"I would say I feel flow state more when I'm doing art than I do when I'm running.\n\n\"I love painting and drawing and I've always thought when I'm painting and drawing time just flies and I just don't want to stop.\"\n\nGeordie Williamson\n\nWilliamson has found the flow state of mind in the past but has revealed it can be more difficult as time goes by.\n\n\"It takes a lot of time to get there. Often I'll spend many weeks or months grappling with a problem and then slowly you start to know its moving parts,\" Williamson said.\n\n\"I would say that in the past it was quite a regular feature in my life.\n\n\"I have small children, and small children definitely reduce the amount of time you spend in flow state \u2014 I can testify to that.\"\n\nCan you bring on flow deliberately or does it just happen naturally?\n\nHeather Knight has led England against all-time great Australian teams. (AAP: Dave Hunt)\n\nHeather Knight\n\n\"There's like little routines that I have to try and get me in the right mind state that I know I need to have to perform,\" Knight said.\n\n\"Like I'll scrape my guard three times and tap my foot before I take the ball, particularly early in in my innings, cause it sort of resets me after the last ball \u2014 it sort of prepares me.\n\n\"I might play a shot that I have to commit to \u2014 so, playing a reverse sweep actually helps me get into that zone.\"\n\nUrthboy\n\n\"There are all these different ways of which you open up the door and go through it,\" Urthboy said.\n\n\"A lot of it is time, giving time to something. In the studio definitely.\n\n\"On the stage, you don't have time \u2014 you've just got to be there.\n\n\"In the studio you can be slow moving to that zone or you can be clarified in your thinking.\n\n\"If you give time and availability to the idea, you have always a different pathway to how quickly you can get to that spot.\"\n\nJessica Stenson\n\n\"I think it's more of a 'ooh I'm here now,'\" Stenson said.\n\nStenson has won a Commonwealth Games gold medal and two bronzes. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\n\"But I did try to be intentional [during the Valencia marathon], which I haven't done much in marathons before \u2014 to try and switch off my thinking a little.\n\n\"There's a blue line that you follow in a lot of marathons, and I remember just looking down at the blue line and listening to my feet and trying to remove any other thoughts and that I feel kind of prompted that state a little.\"\n\nGeordie Williamson\n\n\"You absolutely cannot bring it on deliberately,\" Williamson said.\n\n\"You can really want it badly and it doesn't happen, and then sometimes it'll happen out of nowhere, like, 'oh, great'.\n\n\"It's very, very unpredictable, I would say.\n\n\"You can try to encourage it, I think not being busy is critical.\n\n\"And also, like a really, really focused engagement with the problem. That very deliberate practise I think is a prerequisite.\n\n\"I also feel that kind of meditative aspects can also be helpful. Like paying attention to the wind on your face and that kind of thing can help bring it on.\"\n\nHow important is flow?\n\nAll athletes search for that \"zone\", but it's hard to find. (Getty Images: Matt King)\n\nHeather Knight\n\n\"I think certainly I've learned throughout my career that you don't have to be perfect to perform,\" Knight said.\n\n\"It's actually when you're not feeling like that and you you're able to put in performances and score runs, that's when you're at your most valuable.\n\n\"Certainly, it's something to strive to, and all the athletes are certainly searching for it, but yeah, it doesn't happen very often.\n\n\"But I think If you search for that perfection \u2014 that flow \u2014 all the time and expect to reach it all the time, you're setting yourself unrealistic targets.\"\n\nJess Stenson\n\n\"I think you don't want to go into a race expecting that you'll feel it, because then you open yourself up to feel disappointed or stressed that you're not there,\" Stenson said.\n\n\"I go into a race expecting it's going to feel really hard and so if it comes, it's very welcome.\n\n\"I think it's fun to acknowledge it while you're in it, but I know that there are so many ups and downs in a marathon and while you can be feeling brilliant one moment, you might not feel great the next.\"\n\nSometimes everything just clicks into place. (Getty Images: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto)\n\nCaroline Anderson\n\n\"I really like the concept of flow. I think it's great to talk about as an interesting piece, I just don't think it's the be all and end all,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"For the majority of sports, it's not something that we want to have as a goal \u2014 it's something that can either happen or doesn't, and that's great either way.\n\n\"I believe there's a paradox where the more we want to be in flow and the more expectation that we have that we have to be in flow in order to perform well, probably the less likely we are to get in flow.\n\n\"And I think we can get a trap if we think that the only way to get high performance or a gold medal result is through flow.\"\n\nSome final words from performance psychologist, Caroline Anderson, on how she helps athletes create a mindset that could lead to flow state.\n\n\"I think one of the barriers that people have is normal nervousness, performance anxiety, anticipatory anxiety, pressure, whatever you want to call it leading into an event,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"When you have a good understanding of what your body's doing and why it's doing it \u2014 and this is a normal phenomenon \u2014 we can kind of stop battling it and we just work with what we have.\n\n\"I think learning how to be more present-moment focused in your training [is important].\n\n\"We're just not very good at this in our modern lives, right?\n\n\"And athletes describe this all the time \u2014 they're doing something, but their mind is somewhere else.\n\n\"So, the present moment focus, and then being really clear about task or process related cues.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"A basketballer knows how to shoot a basket without thinking about it. When they're at the club or when they're training, they can do it completely automatically.\n\n\"In a high pressure moment that automation doesn't exist, because our mind wants to go to the threat, it wants to go to the crowds, the consequence \u2014 what if I lose?\n\n\"We need to give our minds really clear process, technical related cues, even if it sounds simple.\n\n\"So, what's my body stance? What arm position do I want to have? What do I want to do with the release of the ball? It sounds simple, but we need to give our mind these anchor points because otherwise it's just going to go in different directions.\n\n\"And the more that we train those, the more likelihood we are to go into flow.\"",

    "text": "Philip Bell and Mark O'Dea have very different sailing origin stories, but they work very well on the water \u2014 and this year they are coming together again to race She in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race.\n\nThey and the rest of the crew will honour the boat that has more experience in the 628 nautical mile (1,163km) blue ocean classic than all but a handful of craft in the race's long history.\n\nThey will also mark a man that connects them both, a former owner and skipper of She who died a year ago.\n\nShe is a modified Olsen 40 boat \u2014 indeed it has been more modified than most, thanks to that former owner, the late Peter Rodgers.\n\nBell is the current skipper and the man who bought the boat from Rodgers more than a decade ago.\n\nA semi-retired civil engineer who ran his own business for many years, he acknowledges he didn't have the usual start to his sailing career.\n\n\"Most people take it up [early], they say it was at five years old or something,\" Bell says.\n\n\"I was 60 years old. I did a Yachtmasters course then.\n\n\"I reckoned you need to be rich or have lots of time on your hands [to do this].\n\n\"I started looking around for a boat and that's a pretty daunting task. Eventually I found a boat and [She] had actually done 17 Sydney to Hobarts and I said, 'Oh, that must be a fairly robust boat.'\"\n\nFirst stop Hobart, next up Osaka for Annette and Sophie For Annette Hesselmans and her daughter Sophie Snijders aboard Fika, the Sydney to Hobart's 628 nautical mile bluewater classic is just a qualifier for the Melbourne to Osaka marine marathon.\n\nBell says he never intended initially to do offshore racing. But then he sailed a couple of times with O'Dea, who had been second-in-command on She under Rodgers.\n\n\"As I started doing a little bit of racing just here locally and I realised that the ship, she had become a bit of a men's shed,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got a lot of people over 60 sailing, a lot of men over 60 [and] of the 10 people who are regulars with me, I would say six of them have been with me for 10 years.\n\n\"So it became sort of a little bit of a \u2014 cult's not the right word \u2014 but certainly a fellowship.\"\n\nAfter learning the ropes of offshore racing, Philip Bell's first Sydney to Hobart aboard She was in 2016. (Supplied: Richard Bennett Photography)\n\nBell's first Sydney to Hobart was in 2016. He built up his experience starting with local races on the Gold Coast, then more than a handful of races in North Queensland and the Whitsundays and northern NSW leading into 2016.\n\nSo what is life like sailing beyond the margins?\n\n\"Because we live such a comfortable life on land every now and then to be out on the edge actually gives you an incentive to, and it makes you, appreciate your comfortable bed at home and the nice things that we've got around us,\" Bell says.\n\n\"It's a reminder that being on the edge and not being necessarily totally in control of everything [that] nature's probably in control.\"\n\nThe skipper says there are a lot of fanatical people who love the race who take part over and over again, pointing to the instructor for his sea safety certificate who had taken part in 47 Sydney to Hobarts.\n\nPhilip Bell's first Sydney to Hobart with She in 2016 ended with an eighth-placed finish in her PHS division. (Supplied: Philip Bell)\n\n\"He's a great instructor because we've all faced serious issues at sea,\" Bell says.\n\n\"If you stay at sea long enough you'll experience the whole raft of experiences from beautiful sailing to being becalmed to being in a storm.\n\n\"And a lot of people say that racing is like 80 per cent boredom, 10 per cent joy and 10 per cent terror.\"\n\nIn 2023 She failed to make the finish due to the mainsail blowing out.\n\n\"We sailed for another half a day. And then when we looked at the forecast and we said 'this is not so smart',\" Bell says.\n\n\"Safety being the key, you've got eight people to worry about, we decided to turn around.\"\n\nSkipper Philip Bell had to pull She out of the race in 2023, receiving the inauspicious trophy for the first boat into Eden. (Supplied: Philip Bell)\n\nBell is quite clear about his number one concern during the race.\n\n\"Because we can't stop overnight at a motel we've got to continue the race until we get to the end. So therefore one of the biggest factors, especially in the 40-footers, is fatigue,\" he says.\n\nAfter the first few hours charging south down the coast with spinnaker up, the crew shift into \"four up, four down\" mode, with half on shift at any one time to allow them to have \"something left in the tank on day three\".\n\n\"I've got a stations list of what everyone has to do because not everyone's got exactly the same skills. So I have to know what each person is capable of and make the most of that,\" he says.\n\nPhilip Bell (second left, front row) and the full crew of eight on board She before the 2022 Sydney to Hobart. (Supplied: Philip Bell/Crew partner)\n\nIf there's one thing Bell sees as a barrier for sailors to completing the Hobart, it's a fairly obvious one.\n\n\"I don't get seasick. I don't think you could do this job if you got seasick,\" he says.\n\n\"I mean, I did have a 2IC in the 2017 Hobart who did get seasick, but somehow he coped.\n\n\"I dunno how he did it, but he coped and he'd get up every shift. He'd get up and spew his guts out and do what he had to do and he'd go back to sleep \u2014 the next shift the same.\"\n\nBell has seen plenty of different conditions in his time doing the Hobart \u2014 this year will be his sixth.\n\n\"The only surprise was in 2019 when the fires were on, those fires just created a massive micro-climate,\" he says.\n\n\"For example, we got becalmed off St Helen's and then we picked up wind and we got to Tasman Island.\n\n\"Then when we turned into Storm Bay, instead of it being freezing, that wind was so hot [and] blowing at about 35 knots (64.8km/h) that the stanchions, the stainless steel stanchions, people leaned up against them and they got burned.\n\n\"It was like 40 degrees and driven by the fires around Eden, across Bass Strait, and the northerly was just amazing.\"\n\nThe Sydney to Hobart went ahead in 2019 but fires created their own micro-climate for racers. (Getty Images: Alea/Andrea Francolini)\n\nWhat does Bell hope to get from this year's race?\n\n\"I'm 73, 74 next year and I know that I can't keep doing this for that much longer,\" he says.\n\n\"Whether this will be the last or the second to last, I don't know.\n\n\"But then if you stop then you're not going back, are you?\"\n\nThere is another driving force behind this year's race.\n\n\"Peter Rodgers, who was a good friend of mine, the previous owner, a real character in Sydney, he passed away in December last year,\" Bell says.\n\n\"And we promised [Rodger's wife] Pat that we would make some gesture with that. So we're having Peter Rodgers Memorial Race on our jerseys this year.\"\n\nThe Peter Rodgers Memorial Race\n\nAs the crew is gathered in Sydney to prepare for the race, Rodgers will be on most of their minds.\n\nSkipper Peter Rodgers (left) and second-in-command Mark O'Dea shared many Sydney to Hobarts together. (Supplied: Mark O'Dea)\n\nO'Dea was the 2IC for the former owner over many races and has been involved with the boat on and off for many years.\n\nHe says Rodgers, who died aged 86, was a personality but not a hands-on skipper.\n\n\"He tended to keep out of things a lot, decisions like what direction to go and what sails to put up. But he really, really enjoyed it [sailing and the race],\" O'Dea says.\n\n\"He put a lot of money into the boat and a lot of time, he was very dedicated.\n\n\"I think it was his escape. He was running a business, a big accountancy firm in the city, and I think that managerial task and all that responsibility, I think he needed some sort of escape from that, and sailing was it.\"\n\nOne story O'Dea remembers fondly involves the Iron Pot Lighthouse, a red and white landmark for sailors on the edge of the Derwent River that marks the start of the final section of the race.\n\nFor former She skipper Peter Rodgers, the Iron Pot Lighthouse was not just a landmark but a source of frustration. (Getty Images: Andrea Francolini)\n\n\"Every single time we went past this \u2014 and he [Rodgers] would say 'if I'm asleep when we get to the Iron Pot, wake me up' \u2014 he'd yell and scream at it,\" O'Dea says.\n\n\"He was an eccentric fella, and quite funny \u2014 he used to swear at this damn thing really loud, thank God there weren't any houses around.\n\n\"He'd say 'you've cost me thousands and thousands of dollars, you bloody thing, you make me come down here every year'.\n\n\"He'd have us all in stitches on the deck, but that is what that race is all about \u2014 memories of things like that. And then [after the outburst] he'd just go downstairs and have a sleep. Iron Pot abuse.\"\n\nWhereas Bell came to sailing late, O'Dea has been doing it nearly all his life.\n\nHis career involves the water too as he is a shipwright, or boat builder.\n\n\"I was lucky enough to be born near Middle Harbour [in Sydney] and that's what we did in the school holidays was boats, boats, boats,\" he says.\n\n\"It taught us all at an early age how to read the breeze and read the currents.\"\n\nMark O'Dea helped build a number of America's Cup boats for Australian sailing great Syd Fischer (left). (Getty Images: Stephen Dunn)\n\nO'Dea was a determined sailor, with lofty dreams. He remembers listening to broadcasts of the America's Cup on a crystal radio set in his room in the '60s.\n\nHe went on to help build five America's Cup boats, most with the great Syd Fischer, and was on the extended sailing list for Steak N'Kidney in the 1987 challenger series.\n\nHis first Sydney to Hobart was in 1984, one of the worst years in the race's history.\n\nAsked why people race in these big races over and over, he replies:\n\n\"Probably because you forget about all the bad things [about the race]. You've got 12 months to forget about it,\" O'Dea says.\n\n\"When I did my '84 race it took me four years to go back and do another one.

(ABC News: Lincoln Rothall)\n\nArtist Peter Drew, who began displaying his \"Aussie\" artwork series around Adelaide and other capital cities in 2016, estimated that he replaces a poster \"once a month\" due to racist vandalism.\n\nHe hit back at the perpetrator on Wednesday.\n\n\"They call themselves 'patriots' but they are not patriotic,\" he said.\n\n\"They don't love Australia.

(ABC News: Lincoln Rothall)\n\nDr Ross said it was significant that the vandal had targeted one of Drew's posters, which feature people who applied for exemptions to the White Australia policy.\n\nShe said the images drew attention to the fact that \"White Australia was never just white Australia\".\n\n\"It's not just any old thing that's been graffitied here. It's quite a symbolic statement about who's an Australian and who's welcome in Australia,\" she said.\n\nWhat Is A Real Aussie? Street artist Peter Drew beings a new project asking What Is A Real Aussie?\n\n\"So it's important that we say 'Yes, actually these people on the posters contributed to the making of modern Australia and they are welcome as Australians.'\"\n\nDrew said graffiti also forced him recently to replace an \"Aussie\" poster that depicted a Jewish World War II veteran.\n\nShai Wittles, a member of the Jewish community in Adelaide, said tensions had escalated following the Bondi attack.\n\n\"What I'm seeing is, in the wake of this tragedy, I'm seeing white supremacists emboldened and I'm seeing a lot of people using Bondi as a justification for their white supremacy,\" they said.\n\n\"I think that these escalations are making everyone less safe.\"\n\nThey said the intent behind incidents such as the graffiti was to stoke division within the community.\n\nMinister says act doesn't represent SA\n\nMinister for Multicultural Affairs Zoe Bettison said the message was \"offensive and disappointing\".\n\nZoe Bettison calls on South Australians to \"stand together in the spirit of unity\".\n\n\"While acts like this can be hurtful and divisive, they do not reflect who we are as a community,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"South Australia is an overwhelmingly harmonious and inclusive multicultural state.\n\n\"It's important we all take time to reflect on the recent events and be reminded of the values of kindness, respect and looking out for one another.\n\n\"South Australians reject hate and continue to stand together in the spirit of unity and goodwill.\"\n\nMonga Khan was a hawker and itinerant worker who arrived in Australia in 1895 shortly before the White Australia policy began.\n\nHe applied for an exemption to the policy's dictation test so he could be re-admitted into Australia without taking the test designed to keep him out.\n\nThe image depicted in the poster is from his application for the exemption.",

According to the clothing stewardship scheme Seamless Australia, more than 220,000 tonnes of clothing were sent to landfill in 2024, a decrease of 1 per cent from the previous year.\n\nIt has left some shoppers and sellers questioning whether the thrifting industry is successfully helping Australians reduce consumption.\n\nSecond-hand jewellery is popular at market stores.

    "text": "The slogan of \"a diamond is forever\" \u2014 linking diamonds to everlasting love and ultimate commitment \u2014 has been instilled for decades.\n\nDiamonds are generally considered a luxury asset that holds its value, but the emergence of laboratory-grown diamonds in the jewellery industry over recent years could challenge that belief.\n\nAre synthetic diamonds real diamonds, and what do you need to know before making a purchase?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nAre laboratory-grown diamonds actually diamonds?\n\nYes, lab-grown diamonds, also known as synthetic diamonds or man-made diamonds, have identical chemical, physical and optical properties to their natural counterparts.\n\nDespite their near-identical appearance, trained gemologists and sophisticated equipment can still detect subtle differences.\n\nUncut natural diamonds in different colours. (Supplied: Geoscience Australia)\n\nNatural diamonds, or mined diamonds, are extremely rare compared to other minerals, according to Geoscience Australia.\n\nThey form at depths of 150 to 200 kilometres below the Earth's surface where high temperatures and pressures allow them to crystallise.\n\nThen the diamonds may be picked up by hot magma and transported upwards as the magma intrudes into the Earth's crust.\n\nNatural diamond rings and diamonds on a display tray with a 10-carat ring (left) worth $698,000. (ABC News: Yiying Li)\n\nMost natural diamonds are between 1 and 3 billion years old.\n\nAccording to Macquarie University, the two main methods for growing synthetic diamonds today are the high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) method and chemical vapour deposition (CVD).\n\nHPHT mimics Earth's conditions to create diamonds, while CVD grows them atom-by-atom in a vacuum chamber by exposing a diamond seed to carbon-rich gases.\n\nDe Beers employees work on belt presses for HPHT-synthesised diamonds in a laboratory. (Getty Images: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg)\n\nHow do lab-grown diamonds compare to natural ones financially?\n\nFrom a quality perspective, synthetic diamonds benefit from highly controlled production environments, resulting in a consistently strong cut, colour and clarity, the Jewellers Association of Australia (JAA) has told the ABC.\n\n\"Yet one of their most significant drawbacks is their negligible resale value,\" a spokesperson from the JAA said.\n\n\"In circumstances where jewellery is later sold, such as after the breakdown of a marriage, the intrinsic worth of a synthetic diamond is effectively zero, leaving only the value of the precious metal.\n\n\"On the other hand, because synthetic diamonds are substantially cheaper than natural stones, the overall financial loss to consumers can be lower.\"\n\nThe spokesperson noted that many buyers preferred natural diamonds for their geological rarity and the long-standing heritage of mined gemstones.\n\nA bench jeweller crafts a natural diamond earring in a workshop. (ABC News: Yiying Li)\n\nIn general, lab-grown diamonds are 30-70 per cent cheaper than natural ones per carat.\n\nThe price of lab-grown diamonds was expected to drop further as production capacity increases, the JAA said.\n\nTherefore, synthetic diamonds should not be considered investment stones and must be marketed accordingly, and retailers' clear disclosure remains paramount, the association said.\n\nDo lab-grown diamonds have a future in Australia?\n\nExperts say yes, with younger consumers being the main driving force.\n\nMillennials and gen Z would drive virtually all luxury market growth going forward, said Marty Hurwitz, a co-founder of the Global Diamond Trade Organisation (GDTO).\n\nMarty Hurwitz says the market for lab-grown diamonds could reach as much as 70 per cent by the end of 2026. (Supplied)\n\n\"These buyers prize sustainability, transparency, and digital fluency \u2014 values that are already reshaping every corner of discretionary spending,\" Mr Hurwitz said.\n\n\"Our research estimates show the current retail market share between 50-60 per cent in favour of lab-grown diamonds in Australia.\"\n\nHe said it could reach as much as 70 per cent by the end of 2026.\n\nSynthetic diamonds were also increasingly used in watchmaking and other design applications, the JAA noted.\n\nThe association added that sustainability and responsible sourcing were also influencing purchasing decisions in younger Australians.\n\nA miner shows an estimated 5 to 7-carat diamond found near an Angolan village. (Getty Images: Olivier Polet/Corbis)\n\nHowever, the JAA said it was important to recognise that natural diamond mining supported local employment and communities in several developing nations.\n\nHistorically, so-called \"blood diamonds\" or \"conflict diamonds\" had been used to help fund armed conflicts, particularly in Africa.\n\nOver the past couple of decades however there has been a concerted international effort to reduce trade in stones of dubious origin.\n\nWhat do jewellers think?\n\nJustin Linney, the creative director of Linneys, a natural diamond jeweller, has criticised some lab-grown diamond retailers for leveraging \"market confusion\" and providing \"misleading information\".\n\n\"The growth in synthetic diamond factories has been driven largely by the misleading marketing term 'lab-grown diamonds', when in reality these are synthetic by definition,\" he said.\n\nIt should be a considered choice to buy natural or lab-grown diamond jewellery. (ABC News: Yiying Li)\n\n\"For some consumers who thought they were purchasing a more environmentally friendly option they are now shocked to see the factory and conditions where these stones are produced.\n\n\" And for consumers who purchased synthetic diamonds over the last few years as a cost-effective alternative, these stones have since lost considerable value. \"\n\nWhile defending natural diamonds, Mr Linney has acknowledged the impact of lab-grown diamonds, saying his business has certainly seen a drop in sales of $4,000-8,000 diamond rings, where buyers in that market might be opting for synthetics.\n\nDifferent lab-grown diamond rings ranged from one to three carats on display. (ABC News: Yiying Li)\n\nMyrtle Polymenopoulos, the retail operations manager for Austen & Blake in Australia and New Zealand, which sells both natural and lab-grown diamonds, said lab-grown diamonds were not replacing natural diamonds but expanding the market instead.\n\n\"Lab-grown diamonds are reshaping the world of jewellery,\" Ms Polymenopoulos said.\n\n\"They have made larger stones, distinctive settings or bespoke creations accessible without stretching a customer's spend.\n\n\" It should be a considered choice with consumers fully aware of the facts and, importantly, the origin of their diamond. \"\n\nShe added that it would come down to the customer's perspective and priorities when deciding which kind of diamond to buy.",

(Supplied.)\n\nA growing number of Australians are also opting to get their news \u2014 often heavily biased commentary or disinformation \u2014 from social media.\n\n\"They're accepting what they're reading online, as true as fact, without necessarily understanding that there could be a whole lot of different opinion and sometimes ulterior motives behind it,\" he said.\n\nMr Tebbey said some couples were now refusing to discuss politics entirely because of their differences.\n\nOthers are continuing to talk about it, but swiftly spiralling into arguments or miscommunication.\n\nThese clashes can have a \"domino effect\", Mr Tebbey said, triggering fears about other issues such as roles in the household or how to raise children.\n\n'This doesn't have to be the end'\n\nMr Tebbey said in some cases, breaking up may be the best option \u2014 but it's not always the first response.\n\n\"This doesn't have to be the end of a relationship,\" he said.\n\nYoung men flocked right in the US election. Will it happen here? Young men across the world have been embracing right-wing politics, while young women have moved to the left. Will it happen in the Australian election too?\n\nHe advised couples to set ground rules around future political discussions to ensure they are open and respectful.\n\n\"For instance \u2014 we will hear each other out and try to see things from the other's perspective without immediately minimising or ridiculing the other person for the beliefs they have,\" Mr Tebbey said.\n\n\"That isn't easy, because we get built up in our own beliefs that we're right and everyone else must therefore be wrong.\"\n\nHe also recommended couples seek support and counselling.\n\n\"This is an issue that's affecting a lot of people,\" he said.\n\n\"You're not alone.\"",

Oy to the World! features Canadian actor Brooke D\u2019Orsay, who has appeared in 10 Christmas-themed movies since 2017 including Deck the Halls on Cherry Lane, Nostalgic Christmas and Christmas in Love. You can\u2019t describe the plots as vanilla as that would be an offence to the vanilla bean. The plot of some Hallmark movies would cause offence to the vanilla bean. Credit: Good Weekend There\u2019s almost always a \u201ccareer-driven\u201d female lead (normally from an evil metropolitan centre like New York) who, for some reason, has to return to an obscure country town. There, she\u2019s likely to face off against a brooding hulk of a gent (with a chance he is a widower). They fight, they resolve, they fall in love. Snow falls and Christmas carols are sung.\n\nLoading So formulaic are these movies, as an experiment, I used AI to see if it could come up with a Hallmark-style Christmas movie but set in an Australian context and featuring a kangaroo. Here\u2019s the plot to \u201cA Dingo Ate My Christmas Spirit\u201d: Chloe Peterson is \u201ca highly successful, driven marketing executive from Sydney\u201d who has a \u201cperfectly un-Christmassy demeanour\u201d. She\u2019s told by her boss to take a digital detox. So Chloe ends up renting a place in a fictional small town north of Brisbane called \u201cJingle Bells Bay\u201d. The rental is double booked, so she has to share with a chap called Liam O\u2019Connell, who is described as a \u201cruggedly handsome, widowed wildlife park ranger\u201d and his daughter Daisy. There\u2019s a kangaroo called Rudolph (he has a medical condition that gives him a red nose) who causes all sorts of trouble around the town.\n\nChloe uses her big-city skills to save Liam\u2019s wildlife sanctuary from closure. Her boss turns up on Christmas Eve to say she\u2019s got a promotion but to get it she has to catch the plane about to leave for Sydney. You know what happens. There\u2019s a spare seat on the direct flight from Jingle Bells Bay to Sydney. Die Hard \u2026 one of the great Christmas movies. But it wouldn\u2019t fit with the AI-generated world of Hallmark. I varied my parameters (including a Hitchcock version, a horror, an action adventure, one set in the South Pole, an Agatha Christie version, one set in space) and they all pumped out variations of my dingo movie. That AI could generate a series of workable plots should not be a surprise. Creating 40 films with a Christmas theme every year invariably means they will look and feel the same. These aren\u2019t destined to win an Oscar \u2013 they are the cheap stocking fillers of film.\n\nLoading But they work for Hallmark and its viewers. These movies are watched (and attract constant ratings on IMDB around 5.5 out of 10) by tens of millions. They make Hallmark, which makes most of these shows in Canada to take advantage of tax concessions and films them on a shoestring, hundreds of millions a year. They\u2019re so popular that next year you can go on a Hallmark Christmas cruise from Florida to the Bahamas. Go onboard to meet some of your favourite Hallmark actors, and enjoy a \u201cSilent Night disco\u201d while swilling a bit of eggnog.\n\nHundreds of actors who would otherwise struggle to afford a gingerbread man make a living frolicking in Hallmark\u2019s fake snow. There\u2019s an entire cottage industry now built on these movies which also extends to social media, where people express their views on all aspects of the Christmas film offerings. You know you\u2019ve reached peak pop culture importance when it crosses over into academia. A Canadian university doctoral student, Megan Lauzier, this year produced a thesis titled More Than Meets the Eye: Unpacking the Popularity of Hallmark Movies. Lauzier argues Hallmark\u2019s social media strategy was a key element to the popularity of \u201cits seemingly unremarkable movies\u201d.\n\nSo predictable are Hallmark movies that Seth MacFarlane used his Family Guy series this year to release a parody with the title \u201cDisney\u2019s Hulu\u2019s Family Guy\u2019s Hallmark Channel\u2019s Lifetime\u2019s Familiar Holiday Movie\u201d. IMDB now lists 503 Hallmark Christmas movies, with the overwhelming majority of them created since 2008. That\u2019s the year after Netflix started its streaming service, a year after Twitter (now X) and a couple of years before Instagram. So formulaic are Hallmark movies that Family Guy this year released its own parody. Credit: Disney+ Pop culture has always been economically driven. But Hallmark and its Christmas movies are at an entirely new level, delivering economic opportunities in ways unimaginable a few years ago. The interaction of technology, tax concessions, streaming services with hours to fill, advertisers looking for specialist markets, real (and artificial) social media influencers is literally playing out on our televisions/handheld devices.",

If you\u2019re a big-ship enthusiast, then Norwegian Cruise Line, in response to strong demand for Asian cruises, is sending four ships to Asia for a bumper 50-voyage season finishing in April 2027. Norwegian Jade makes its Asian debut in October 2026; guests can embark in Tokyo, Incheon, Hong Kong or Singapore. Norwegian Sky sailing past Mount Fuji in Japan. Princess Cruises will see its biggest Japan season ever in 2027, when Diamond Princess and Sapphire Princess sail 78 departures. Among the highlights are cherry-blossom voyages, a circumnavigation of Japan, and cruises that take in the Okinawa islands and Taiwan. Between November 2026 and March 2027, Diamond Princess will homeport in Singapore and offer 11 sailings to 28 ports across the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Carnival Cruise Line is sending two ships \u2013 Carnival Luminosa and Carnival Adventure \u2013 to Asia for the first time over the 2026-27 season. Although they sail only four itineraries, the move finally recognises Asia as a cruise destination in itself, rather than somewhere to pass through on repositioning cruises. Among the itineraries is Sydney-Singapore, Tokyo-Singapore and a roundtrip voyage from Singapore taking in ports in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. Carnival ships will visit Hong Kong, Osaka, Fukuoka, Seogwipo (Jeju) and Keelung for the first time. Royal Caribbean\u2019s Navigator of the Seas. After an even bigger ship? Royal Caribbean\u2019s Navigator of the Seas will homeport for the first time in Singapore between October 2026 and February 2027 and sail three to 12-night cruises to destinations such as Penang, Phuket, Langkawi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City before heading towards Japan on East Asia itineraries. If it\u2019s a smaller, luxury experience you\u2019re after, Seabourn too is rolling out new Asian voyages between December 2026 and April 2027. Its Japan voyages notably visit not just big-name ports but smaller ones such as Toba, Miyako, Sendai and Hitachinaka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeabourn Encore will also sail a 12-day voyage from Hong Kong to Tokyo, and South-East Asian voyages between Singapore and Hong Kong or round-trip from Singapore.

New Australian expedition company Pearl Expeditions will sail in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea from the end of this year. Coral Expeditions continues to operate throughout Indonesia and is increasing capacity in Papua New Guinea on new itineraries in October and November 2026.

    "text": "The mystery box, the deciding half of the contest, was how England\u2019s bowling would go against Australia\u2019s batting (or, as it looked in the first innings in Perth, vice versa). England\u2019s eschewal of spin was not a bad plan. Muttiah Muralitharan was ineffective on Australian pitches, as were Ravi Ashwin, Rangana Herath and Yasir Shah. Anil Kumble, Graeme Swann and Saqlain Mushtaq did passably well. Much has been made of Travis Head\u2019s batting in Perth, but he had plenty of luck, and England\u2019s bowling was awful. Credit: Getty Images Year after year we see that it takes a lifetime of patience and spin bowling smarts in Australian conditions to eke out success. Lacking the required talent, England sensibly opted for pace. The promise was that Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, Brydon Carse, Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, Matthew Potts and Stokes would batter Australia\u2019s brittle top order with speed. They haven\u2019t been good enough or fit enough, and Australia have winkled out winning totals by osmosis. Much has been made, rightly, of Travis Head\u2019s second innings in Perth. He was also streaky and lucky. But England\u2019s bowling was horrible, and if Head hadn\u2019t played that winning knock it\u2019s likely that Steve Smith and the middle order would have found 200 runs between them.\n\nArcher\u2019s lines, as much as his fall in pace, were woeful. Wood was gone. Carse and Atkinson were either confused by poor instructions, tired due to their lack of practice, or too easily discouraged by the counter-attack from Head and Jake Weatherald. In Brisbane and Adelaide, England wilted in the heat and again bowled inconsistent lengths. Archer picked up some wickets through Australian inattention, and bowled fast at times, but the home batsmen were able to see him off, knowing he could not return for good spells. Jofra Archer\u2019s performances have been mixed, at best. Credit: Getty Images They eventually managed it against Jasprit Bumrah last season, and Archer is no Bumrah. The other bowlers were pedestrian. When Alex Carey steadied his partners in Brisbane and Adelaide \u2013 those sequences of play where the Ashes were decided \u2013 England\u2019s bowling did not challenge them consistently. Big Test series are usually won at the margins: dry spells of bowling, tail-end runs and basic fielding.\n\nAustralia\u2019s bottom five partnerships contributed 219 runs in Brisbane and 186 in the first innings in Adelaide. In the field, for every screamer snatched by the Australians, there have been two catches dropped by England. Loading On the third afternoon in Adelaide, when the Ashes were there to be won or lost, Stokes did not bowl, and he gave Archer the ball belatedly and cautiously. He set fields that enabled Head and Carey to rotate the strike at their leisure. When Head was losing concentration, Carey calmed him down, but the task was made easier by England\u2019s sloppy bowling and slackness in the field. What was in Stokes\u2019 mind? He said his body was breaking after his defensive vigil with the bat, and evidently two and a half hours of batting had done Archer in. Yes, it was hot, but try telling Greg Matthews that. In the tied Test in Chennai in 1986, in 50-degree heat, Matthews batted for three hours across both innings and bowled 78 overs, some of them in a vest. Ravi Shastri bowled 61 overs and batted for four hours. The late Dean Jones\u2019 feats have gone down in cricketing folklore and medical literature. Not to say they built them tougher in those days, but still, Stokes\u2019 actions in Adelaide looked very much like a disappointed man throwing a tantrum, or a sulk, against his own teammates.\n\nWhen there is such a difference in outcricket (the basics of bowling and fielding) the one key factor separating Australia and England in these Ashes \u2013 the problem is nearly always leadership. Leadership can\u2019t produce talent from nowhere, but it can set a productive frame of mind, keep spirits high, sustain concentration and control the controllables. Stokes\u2019 brand of leadership has been top-down, bloody-minded and bullying. Whatever speeches he has given, the messages from his performances have been to challenge teammates to follow him and deride them as \u201cweak\u201d if they can\u2019t; to stonewall and take no risks in preserving his own wicket, heaping pressure on the others; and to let his passions override his composure in the field, leading to self-evidently poor tactics, fields that don\u2019t suit his bowlers and emotional decision-making. Ben Stokes\u2019 actions in Adelaide looked very much like a disappointed man throwing a tantrum. Credit: Getty Images Stokes\u2019 personal contributions with bat and ball have been strong, and he is capable of more highlights in Melbourne and Sydney. But runs and wickets are only part of the picture, and when time has passed and players produce their memoirs of this tour, don\u2019t be surprised if there are stories of Stokes going a bit Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now on his team in 2025. His batting, in the series, has been pure Kurtz: \u201cOut there on his own, operating without any decent restraint\u201d. This is not a criticism of the way he has batted per se, but it can only have been read, in his team, as a criticism of them and a withdrawal of the paternal blessings and encouragements he had heaped on them since 2022.\n\nIt is probably a burden of the past. Loading Stokes has been England\u2019s best cricketer and dominant personality, but by now his warrior-exemplar model of captaincy appears to have trapped him. He\u2019s trying to play that Headingley 2019 innings every time: block everything for three hours and demand that someone stays with him. The outrageous luck he received on the field at Headingley and in the 2019 World Cup final left him with a messianic status in English cricket. When he has lived up to it, he has had the attributes of a magical leader who requires from his team only the simple donation of their absolute faith. Whatever trouble they get in, Stokes will save them. It\u2019s been called a cult of personality even by media who have knowingly aided and abetted it. When cults of personality collapse, they do so suddenly and in the most undignified manner.",

    "text": "A US-based representative for the Olayan Group didn\u2019t comment and directed all requests to a Saudi-based spokesperson, who didn\u2019t respond to a detailed list of questions. Most global executives are reluctant to speak about the family for fear of offending the sisters, who are known to fiercely guard their privacy. This story is based on an analysis of the family\u2019s investments, operating companies and filings of family-owned entities, as well as interviews with more than half a dozen people familiar with the group, who asked not to be named discussing information that isn\u2019t public. Wall Street bosses Hutham and Lubna, both in their early seventies, were born in Saudi Arabia to Suliman Olayan. The patriarch was orphaned at a young age and started out working as a dispatcher for the predecessor company of Saudi Aramco, leveraging his fluent English. He mortgaged his house for $US8000 to win a pipeline contract, according to a profile in Time magazine, eventually launching the Olayan Group in 1947. From there, Suliman diversified aggressively, and the group went on to strike partnerships to sell Colgate toothpaste, Oreos and Coca-Cola in the kingdom. He bought US equities to use as credit with American banks and by 1980, his conglomerate brought in more than $US300 million in annual revenue, according to the Time profile.\n\nLoading His globalist bent created a uniquely bi-national empire that the daughters were immersed in early. Both studied in the US and were given significant jobs in the family business on their return. After Suliman\u2019s death in 2002, his son Khaled was named chairman of Olayan Group, but Lubna and Hutham helped run much of the family\u2019s vast operations. Lubna led the Mideast-focused division and Hutham took charge of Olayan America. The sisters married foreigners and took on prominent roles \u2014 Lubna was the first woman elected to the board of a public company in Saudi Arabia in 2004. Even then, women\u2019s rights were severely limited in the kingdom. Only in 2018 were women finally given the right to drive. Low profile In an interview with NPR in 2018, Lubna recalled the difficulty finding a ladies room in factories and boardrooms because there were usually no women. She began approaching government officials and executives for help boosting the female workforce \u2014 all the while being reminded to tread carefully and attempting to avoid confrontation.\n\n\u201cSo, you negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,\u201d she said in the interview about those early efforts. Along the way, the sisters developed reputations for being steely negotiators. Their ascent was aided by an ability to keep a low profile and the duo ensured their business was seen as supportive of the government\u2019s aims. The group is now officially headquartered in Liechtenstein, with offices around the world, including in Athens, where Lubna\u2019s lawyer husband has deep ties. Over the years, the family has gained a reputation for running a stringently professional organisation that\u2019s sophisticated in its dealmaking at a level not typically seen at family offices. The Olayans are deemed richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia\u2019s Warren Buffett. Credit: AP \u201cThe family was very conscious of incorporating corporate governance frameworks into their business, and they did it with a high level of professionalism,\u201d said Josiane Fahed-Sreih, director of the Institute of Family and Entrepreneurial Business at Lebanese American University.\n\nIn one sign of their influence, the Olayan family was untouched in 2017 when dozens of Saudi royals, former officials and businessmen, including Alwaleed, were detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh as the crown prince consolidated power and conducted an unprecedented national shakeup. Investing misstep Alwaleed, worth about $US17 billion these days, has made a comeback of sorts in recent years and his investment group has benefited from the kingdom\u2019s construction frenzy. In the 1990s, the businessman was known for a flamboyant lifestyle, frequently pictured on a private yacht purchased from Donald Trump. The Olayans do things differently. \u201cNormally we don\u2019t seek the limelight\u2026especially anything splashy,\u201d Hutham said about the Olayan family in a speech to the Arab Bankers Association of North America in 2013. \u201cWe avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.\u201d\n\nEven so, there have been investing missteps. A longtime investor in Credit Suisse, they stuck by the bank even through its downturn, ultimately becoming one of the big losers in the turmoil that culminated with UBS Group\u2019s discount purchase of the troubled lender. The losses were at a scale that could roil large financial firms, but one international executive recalls the collapse being treated as a relative non-event within the Olayan Group. The conglomerate continued to execute transactions and payments as normal during the period, the person said. Loading Saudi National Bank, the Swiss lender\u2019s top shareholder, was among firms that lost money on its investment and its chairman resigned in the aftermath. Meanwhile, the Olayans\u2019 profile has only grown in the years since. Key to that are their relationships on Wall Street and within the kingdom, particularly as Riyadh has started to intensify pressure on foreign firms to invest more locally and help diversify the economy.\n\nDespite recent fiscal pressures, Saudi Arabia remains a lucrative market for the titans of global finance: Riyadh ranks as one of the biggest issuers of debt in recent years, while the kingdom\u2019s wealth fund has shown an appetite for blockbuster deals like the recent $US55 billion transaction to take Electronic Arts Inc private. Lubna has close connections to BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink, among others, and was recently named co-chair of the US-Saudi Business Council alongside Citi\u2019s Fraser. Hutham sits on the board of Brookfield, which ranks as one of the biggest private equity investors in the Middle East. Davos in the Desert This year, during Saudi Arabia\u2019s Future Investment Initiative conference, often called Davos in the Desert, Lubna hosted a party in Riyadh that had top global financial executives and officials mingling over canap\u00e9s and rice and lamb, according to one attendee. Their links run broader than just finance. The US equity investments their father started to amass in the 1960s have grown to $US12.7 billion. These days, the portfolio includes stakes in Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. By comparison, Saudi Arabia\u2019s $US1 trillion wealth fund owns just over $US19 billion in US stocks.\n\nThe group\u2019s private equity portfolio forms another large chunk, and is estimated to run into the tens of billions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. Compounded annual growth rate for direct investments has exceeded 30 per cent over a 10-year period, according to its website. The firm\u2019s real-estate holdings span more than 40 million square feet and 40,000 apartments under management. At home, the Olayans have backed the kingdom\u2019s biggest efforts. When Saudi Aramco\u2019s $US25 billion IPO struggled to attract international investors in 2019, the Olayan family was among those tapped locally by the administration of MBS \u2014 as the de facto ruler is called \u2014 to shore up demand. Lubna Olayan has successfully navigated the obstacles for women in the Saudi business world. \u201cYou negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,\u201d she says. Credit: Bloomberg At the same time, the sisters have managed a careful balancing act with their public comments. In 2018, as much of Wall Street avoided the kingdom\u2019s FII conference after Saudi agents murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Lubna used the start of a panel discussion to mourn his death, saying that the act ran counter to Saudi values. \u201cWe are very grateful that the terrible acts reported in recent weeks are alien to our culture and our DNA,\u201d Lubna said in her address.\n\nThese days, Lubna is chair of the Olayan Group\u2019s corporate board, according to a recent press release from the US-Saudi Business Council. Hutham chairs the shareholders\u2019 board, the group\u2019s website says. Day-to-day operations are mostly managed by the likes of Chief Executive Officer Hani Lazkani and Chief Operating Officer Samer Yaghnam, people familiar with the matter said, though the sisters remain the public face of the group and helm broad strategy with family members. Loading Multiple people described Lubna as frank and outgoing, with a reputation for being deeply involved with her investments. Like her father, she\u2019s worldly and warm but also incisive, said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a friend of the late Suliman. \u201cIf you talk with her about current events, it\u2019s not just, \u2018This happened.\u2019 She understands why things are moving the way they are.\u201d Hutham, meanwhile, appears soft-spoken and grandmotherly in conversation, but her line of gentle questioning can elicit small details that can serve as fodder for the negotiating table, according to one international executive.",

But I guess if it was easy to do it would have already been done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team used a multibeam sonar to map the lake bed over nine days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Basically, it's just as if we emptied the lake of its water, and we're walking around and we're mapping it out. So I think it's going to be quite fascinating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir work has revealed an underwater landscape that's never been seen before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can see the input of fresh water basically coming into the lake from the mountains and it's carving through the lake floor so we have these waterfalls basically coming down into the lake and then reaching the cliffs, it's pretty incredible to look at and you can see the trees as well sometimes overhanging these areas, it's quite spectacular.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Croghan has been running a Lodge at the southern end of the lake for almost 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Personally, I would describe the lake as my church. It is the most peaceful place on this planet. I may be biased, but so many other people are saying the same thing. Visually stunning, never the same two days in a row. The most phenomenal place to swim, because it's, as I said, it's the cleanest air and it's the cleanest water in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe keeps a special bottle of gin behind the bar that was lowered to the bottom of the lake a few years ago by a different team of researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust for giggles one night, I said to them, would you take a bottle of gin, put it on the bottom of the lake and take a photograph? And they're like, Yeah, sure. So I'm like, okay, great. So they did.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt didn't go down to the deepest point - but it still surpassed 100 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey did the best they could, but they brought the bottle back, and it just sits behind the bar. It's now been depth tested. I think that was about 120 metres.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAugustin D\u00e9plante says the mapping shows the deepest point of Lake St Clair plunges to about 163 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's about towards the south on the western side, just in the corner, basically, we can almost see the glacier would have really, like, you know, grinded through that corner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCloser to shore, a remotely-operated vessel known as the OTTER completed the mapping.\n\n\n\nIt was piloted by autonomous systems research engineer Dr Hui Sheng Lim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It can go really shallow into regions, like less than less than two metre, even less than a metre, as well. As long as there's no, like, hidden rocks or anything underneath the surface. So those are the areas where the big vessel won't be able to get to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Otter revealed areas close to shore with sharp drop-offs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do, it's like mapping the shallow region so you can actually see how the contour changes on the shoreline. And you'll see how quick that actually dropped from the shoreline, like all the way down to 50 metres, like you can see a metre here, and then next moment you are in a 10 metre zone, and next moment you're already in, like, 30 metre, 50 metres deep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOtter can also operate autonomously, following a precise, pre-planned path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the most useful features is we will be able to autonomously find gaps and find the best way to cover those missing gaps in our data sets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe detailed data collected will be made public, providing an important resource it's hoped will fuel further study of Lake St Clair.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will include what might be found in the depths.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "For many, Christmas arrives with more than tinsel, pine trees and carols \u2014 it comes layered with accents, aromas and a dazzling array of traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeneath the Australian summer sun, migrant communities bring their own spin to the season, turning the country into a tapestry of festive customs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tapestry is woven from Australia's rich multicultural makeup, and the multitude of Christmas traditions found across the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo capture just a small slice of this diversity, foreign-born journalists across the SBS newsroom wrote about Christmas traditions in their countries of origin and, in some cases, how they've made the season their own in Australia.\n\n\n\nCarols with a desi twang\n\nFor many Indian Australians, Christmas is a lively blend of faith, music and food, infused with the sounds and flavours of home.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional carols are often reworked with Punjabi beats and rhythmic twang, transforming familiar hymns into upbeat performances that invite clapping and joy.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Oh ho ho ho! Sikh Santa lights up Canadian streets with Bhangra moves\n\nAmong Malayalees in Australia, Christmas is celebrated even more widely than Diwali, the Indian festival of lights that marks the triumph of good over evil.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shouldn't be too much of a surprise, given that around 67 per cent of Australian Malayalee \u2014 a cultural group hailing from the southern Indian state of Kerala \u2014 identify as Christian, according to the 2021 Census.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe season is marked by the setting up of cribs depicting the birth of Jesus and lively carol processions, in which community members move from house to house, spreading Christmas cheer.\n\n\n\nFood plays a central role in the festivities \u2014 breakfast often features appam (fermented rice pancakes) with rich duck stew, followed by festive spreads of biryani (mixed rice dish made with spices, meat or vegetables) and other cherished dishes shared with family and friends.\n\n\n\nTimorese traditions: Food, picnics and card games\n\nBeyond church services and festive feasts, card games have become a beloved Christmas tradition for Timorese families worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nGames such as poker, rummy, and the popular seven-card game bring generations together around tables and picnic mats, with larger families often setting up multiple playing areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stakes are minimal, sometimes as little as 10 cents, keeping the focus on fun and connection rather than potential gambling earnings.\n\n\n\nWhether in living rooms or outdoors, the gentle shuffling of cards, mixed with laughter and storytelling, is a familiar soundtrack to the Christmas season in Timor-Leste.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simple yet meaningful ritual has become a cultural cornerstone, uniting Timorese families at home and abroad during the year's most cherished holiday.\n\n\n\nThe Philippines' Mariah Carey and bottle cap tambourines\n\nIn the Philippines and for many Filipinos living around the globe, September signals the start of the Christmas season.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround that time, social media pages are flooded with images of a Filipino Christmas icon and messages like 'Are you ready?', 'It's that time of year, 'Nearly there,' and many other phrases reminding Filipinos that Christmas is just around the corner.\n\n\n\nThis iconic Filipino singer is Jose Mari Chan, whose song Christmas In Our Hearts is widely considered the Philippines' answer to Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas Is You.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas in Our Hearts, which was originally recorded with Chan's daughter, embodies the Filipino Christmas spirit, celebrating Catholic faith and family togetherness as the centre of all celebrations.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas for Filipinos also means a playlist of carols echoing through shopping malls and church walls, with both the old and the young singing them.\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from the traditional carols, you can also see children singing around the neighbourhood with their own makeshift instruments, such as old cans as drums and flattened bottle tops, collected and bunched up in wire, as substitutes for tambourines.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Filipino Christmas is an experience of not only music, faith and family, but also a table full of traditional ham, Filipino Christmas rice cakes like puto bongbong, bibingka, sikwate (hot chocolate) and queso de bola (cheese) on Christmas Eve, with leftovers for Christmas Day.\n\n\n\nUnder the mistletoe: Xmas romance in Japan\n\nWhile many have probably heard of the peculiar Japanese tradition of eating KFC on Christmas, this isn't the only unique way the holiday is marked in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many young couples, Christmas is often a romantic day spent exchanging gifts over a fancy dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, for those without partners, it can be a challenging time of year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it's difficult to pinpoint the origin of this trend, it appears to be the result of successful marketing campaigns, much like the KFC 'tradition'.\n\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Japan experienced an economic boom that fuelled people's appetite for spending. Marketers seized the opportunity and aggressively promoted upscale date and gift ideas to coincide with holidays like Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough many nowadays opt for more cost-efficient options, the custom is still very much alive.\n\n\n\nEach year in Japan, lovers fill the streets on Christmas Eve, walking arm in arm, while Christmas-themed love songs fill the air. Source: Getty / Ippei Naoi So, what should you do if you are single and alone in Japan during Christmas? Don't worry, we won't judge \u2026 at least not openly!\n\n\n\n\n\nJokes aside, whether you are single or not, Christmas time in Japan is truly magical, with cities decorated with winter illuminations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sure is a sight to behold!\n\n\n\nThe Polish 'Chrissie' carp\n\nFor Poles, Christmas Eve is the highlight of the festive season, with celebrations starting when the first star appears.\n\n\n\n\n\nTables glow with candles, and hay under the tablecloth recalls the nativity as well as poverty and simplicity. A free chair is left for the 'late traveller', and families break the op\u0142atek or Christmas wafer, exchanging wishes of love and forgiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nTradition calls for twelve meatless dishes, reflecting a time when meat was a rare luxury and serving as a symbol of wholeness and perfection, while also honouring the twelve apostles of Jesus.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Polish Christmas would also be incomplete without carp, something that surprises many in Australia, where it is considered an unpalatable invasive species.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a Polish Christmas, it is served baked, fried, stuffed, stewed, or in jelly. The most traditional version, 'Jewish-style', is boiled with raisins and onions for a sweet-and-salty twist.\n\n\n\nA Polish Christmas table would be incomplete without carp at the centre. Source: Getty / Alex Bona / SOPA Images / LightRocket Carp arrived in Poland in the 12th century, brought by Czech Cistercians. It was just one of many freshwater fish enjoyed for centuries on the tables of nobility.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the early 20th century, it had become a staple, especially in Jewish households.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a modern Polish restaurant in Brunswick East \u2014 Melbourne's hip, inner-north suburb \u2014 chef Ola G\u0142adysz says carp is surprisingly popular, even though it only appears on the menu for special occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know any other restaurant that serves carp. This year we're expecting lots of Polish guests for Christmas Eve,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians, however, often approach it with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People are a bit unsure because they've never tried it. I soak the carp in milk with onion for six hours to remove the muddy flavour, then dry it thoroughly, season it, and fry it in breadcrumbs. That crispy coating is our way of winning Aussies over,\" she says.\n\n\n\nChef Ola G\u0142adysz says her carp dishes are surprisingly popular at the modern Polish restaurant where she works in Melbourne's hip, inner-north suburb of Brunswick East. Source: Supplied \"Most people who come for our Christmas events are Poles missing home. For them, carp is a taste of childhood,\" G\u0142adysz says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1940s, a communist official famously declared: \"Carp on every Christmas Eve table in Poland.\" However, as World War Two had left the Baltic Sea fishing fleet in ruins, the government promoted fish farming in ponds, and workers often received carp as bonuses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gave rise to the tradition of bringing home live fish \u2014 a necessity in communist Poland, where shortages meant people had to secure their meals a few days in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, carp remains a Christmas fixture, served in a variety of ways.\n\n\n\n",

We'll have around 300 people packing out for a slap-up (meal/celebration) Christmas lunch: ham, turkey, prawn, salads, all the trimmings. That community of 300 people will be made up of people who own tech companies, people who are sleeping on the street. Some of our clients that we have the privilege of serving, all coming together around the table just to celebrate connection, celebrate the Christmas story, particularly for those who wouldn't otherwise have a place to go on Christmas Day; or can't afford to put food on the table.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteering manager, Christine Ireland, says the event is free for those who don't have the financial means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're financially struggling, and this year is tough for a lot of people, you can absolutely come. There's no expectation. If you're able, you can purchase a ticket. And then of course, if you're not able to come, but you are in a financial position, you can plate it forward and purchase a ticket for someone else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA couple of their young volunteers, Carter and Ved, couldn't be happier to be part of the preparations for the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nVOXIE 1: \"Yeah, I love it.

People who are experiencing that financial difficulty, but also people who want to just share that joy of celebrating Christmas, sharing the love of Jesus here in this space. And it's a place where you don't have to be marked out as different. You can come and be a part of it and join in whoever you might be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sense of community can be one of the most beautiful aspects of this holiday season.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Michelle Lim, an associate professor at the University of Sydney and CEO of Ending Loneliness Together, says it's difficult for charity services to address the severity of the loneliness crisis - and how it can be worsened over the holiday season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So many Australians also do not have close family and friends around to share this festive season with. And in particular, many people as well who might say that they're single or perhaps that they're living away from their community - or they have family that lives overseas - often talk about how Christmas or holiday periods can be particularly isolating for them and therefore they might probably experience a higher rate of what we call episodic loneliness.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Lim was the research lead on the 2023 State of the Nation Report into Social Connection in Australia, which found that almost one in three Australians who were surveyed reported problematic levels of loneliness; and one in six reported severe levels of loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it's an often stigmatised issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know things like loneliness in particular is highly stigmatised, even though it's highly prevalent and people don't want to talk about it. Australians who maybe have an existing health problem or disability or mobility issues might be particularly vulnerable during Christmas because as well, they might be seeing fewer people and there might be fewer services around.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother charity group who are doing their best to offer a sense of community to those with disability over the Christmas period is Civic Disability Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations Manager, Katy Williams, says the shutdown of other critical services means their support workers often have to go above and beyond to help their clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things we recognise is people's mental health can decline steadily over the holidays, especially with the closure of services that normally are accessible. In fact, I was just talking to a gentleman who is having wheelchair problems, but the service that's offering him a lend of a wheelchair and servicing his other one is closed for two weeks. We're always there to support our people to get the help they need. So there's always somebody within the team, even if it has nothing to do with us - like wheelchair repair, but we would be there to assist them during these shutdowns.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCivic typically caters to over 800 people around New South Wales, offering supported accommodation, employment opportunities and NDIS services among other initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut CEO Annie Doyle says their support workers also work hard to make Christmas a special time of community for those living in their accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we have people with significant disability, intellectual disability predominantly. But a lot of them are now orphans because they've been in care for a long time. Christmas is quite challenging when you don't have family. And so a lot of what Civic does is around: we stand in effectively for those opportunities so that they feel like they are celebrating Christmas. It's not about the presents and the festivities itself, it's more about just sharing that time with other people, being special on the day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading up to Christmas, support workers have sung carols with clients, created Christmas cards and helped decorate their homes for the festivities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile workers will also offer Christmas meals on the day for those in supported accommodation, Ms Doyle says they also held a special group Christmas lunch so others could join in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We all got together, we had about 150 odd people there for the day. And we do all sorts of games. But what's most important is that we all sit down together and have a shared meal. We just love to have clients experience what it feels to be in a Christmas environment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Williams says she has taken time out of her own Christmas for her clients in the past - and its actions like that, which can remind people that they are not alone during this holiday period.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past 70 years, staff at the North American Aerospace Defence Command \u2013 or NORAD - in Colorado Springs have had a very important task.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally they're scanning the skies on matters of national security but at Christmas, the staff at Peterson Space Force Base turn their attention to Santa.\n\n\n\n\n\nNORAD spokeswoman Colonel Kelly Frushour says Santa is of course no threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's just that the same combination of radar, satellites and jets that help NORAD carry out its mission throughout the year make it capable of tracking Santa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"NORAD tracks Santa using the same capabilities that we use 24-7 to keep the avenues of approach to North America safe. It\u2019s a combination of radars, satellites and fighter jets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Alex Werden is one of the NORAD program managers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019re just happy that we\u2019re able to track them every single year. And the pilots that get to see them, they\u2019re lucky.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that's not all.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Colonel says there's also a hotline to answer callers' questions about Santa's mission - and Michelle Martin is one of the NORAD planners for the Christmas call centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s kind of funny because I don\u2019t think you ever really know who to expect on the other end of the line. Like I said, sometimes it could be a British pub and everybody\u2019s going wild and there\u2019s dozens of people in the background cracking up and having fun and asking us silly questions. And then all the way to a child maybe in hospital with their parent wondering if Santa\u2019s still going to stop by because they\u2019re in a hospital with their parents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nColonel Frushour says it all began seven decades ago when - legend has it - one child called the combat operations centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"70 years ago one young child accidentally dialled the predecessor of NORAD, which was the Continental Air Defense Command. And the colonel who answered the phone heard a child asking him, \u2018where is Santa Claus?\u2019 And the Colonel realised, well, we track everything over North America, and so we absolutely can see where Santa Claus is. We normally just track threats. But he looked up where Santa was and reported it to the child, and then our tradition was born.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time this year, Santa seekers can place a call through the program\u2019s website, which organisers say will be easier for people outside North America.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Martin says the website allows people to follow Santa\u2019s journey in nine languages, including English and Japanese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s nothing more special than a child\u2019s eyes lighting up or a child just feeling pure joy about something that they believe in, and it\u2019s a do-good thing. And so I think just hearing little kids laugh and giggle and ask silly questions, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s fun. And so if we could bring that joy to them in some way, shape or form, then I think we did our job.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile NORAD is based in North America and can follow Santa everywhere, it has helpers in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Services Australia spokesperson Laura Willard has told Channel 9 they have the responsibility of tracking Santa in the local region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Air Services is Australia's official Santa flight management team... We'll be giving Santa his pre-departure clearance with the call sign RED-ONE. There'll be no delays, just smooth sleighing all the way... RED-ONE will be entering Australian airspace over Norfolk Island, zig-zagging across the country, and vacating around the Cocos Islands at sunrise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile back in the United States, the NORAD hotline is already receiving plenty of calls.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Martin says more than a thousand volunteers are manning the phones this Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd she says they plan to continue the tradition as long as possible.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "With summer well and truly here, you might be in the market for a new pair of sunglasses.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the style, colour, price, and level of comfort they offer are all key considerations when selecting your shades, there's one feature that experts say should be everyone's top priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ambhruni Padhye, an optometrist and Specsavers clinical services development consultant, told SBS News: \"The most important factor is ensuring that you've got adequate UV protection.\"\n\n\n\nHow can UV rays damage your eyes?\n\nOverexposure to harmful UV radiation can damage your eye health temporarily and in the long-term.\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-term problems can include excessive blinking, swelling, challenges looking at strong light, and photokeratitis, which is similar to a sunburn of the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnita Dessaix, chair, Cancer Council Australia's Public Health Committee, told SBS News: \"Overtime, exposure to UV can potentially cause serious or permanent eye damage, including cataracts, cancer of the conjunctiva [membrane covering the white of the ey], skin cancer of the eyelids and around the eyes, solar keratopaty [cloudiness of the cornea], and pterygium [an overgrowth of the conjunctiva onto the cornea].\"\n\n\n\nHow to tell if your sunglasses offer good UV protection\n\nAll sunglasses sold in Australia must be tested and labelled in accordance with a mandatory standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are classified into five categories \u2014 from 0 to 4 \u2014 based on the level of protection they provide against sun glare and UV.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lens category number should be listed on the tag or sticker attached to the glasses, and is often printed on the inside of the frame, as well.\n\n\n\nSome or all of these symbols may be printed on the inside of your sunglasses frame. Source: SBS News / Amy Hall If you're buying sunglasses online, make sure to check the product description for the lens category number.\n\n\n\n\n\nDessaix said the Cancer Council recommends wearing close-fitting, wraparound sunglasses with a lens category of 2, 3 or 4 as they \"absorb 95 per cent of UV radiation\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe category of sunglasses that best suits your needs can vary depending on when you plan to wear them, Padhye said.\n\n\n\nEach lens category offers different levels of eye protection against sun glare and UV radiation. Source: SBS News \"Category 2 is medium tint and recommended for everyday sun with good UV protection,\" Padhye said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Category 3 is more of a darker tint, which is ideal for brighter outdoor conditions with strong glare.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile category 4 sunglasses are ideal for high-glare conditions like snow or water, they shouldn't be worn while driving at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose with a lens category of 0 or 1 are generally considered fashion spectacles rather than sunglasses and offer little to no UV protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nPadhye suggested consulting an eye care professional if you're unsure whether the sunglasses you're looking to buy or already own offer adequate UV or sun glare protection.\n\n\n\nOther ways to protect your eyes from UV damage\n\nWearing sunglasses isn't the only way to shield your eyes from UV damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWearing a wide-brimmed hat can add an extra layer of protection, helping to keep the sun off your eyes and face, Padhye said.\n\n\n\nWearing sunglasses is just one part of a sun safe routine. Source: SBS News \"Use sunscreen as well \u2014 just be careful because the skin around the eyes is delicate,\" Padhye said.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of eye sunburn\n\nIf your eyes are painful after being in the sun, you may have photokeratitis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is from the cells that are in your cornea getting damaged,\" Padhye said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The eye can be quite red as well. Sometimes you can get blurry vision, and this can be temporary, but it can also cause a lot of tearing and watery eyes and almost like a gritty, irritated feeling.\"\n\n\n\nHow to treat eye sunburn\n\nIf you suspect you have photokeratitis, Padhye said you should stay indoors to minimise further exposure to UV radiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you do wear contact lenses, I would advise taking them out to avoid further irritation to the eyes,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You should also avoid itching. It can be hard, of course, to try not to rub your eyes, but this will definitely make them worse.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the sunburn you may get on your face or body, photokeratitis can be treated at home.\n\n\n\n\"Some common treatments that can be applied for photokeratitis include using lubricating drops, pain relief medication, as well as placing a cold, damp cloth over your closed eyes to help soothe and cool the eyes,\" Padhye said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you want to ensure you're getting the most appropriate treatment, she recommended seeing an optometrist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do have all the technology to diagnose and treat, and if we do feel there needs further investigation, we can always refer to an eye specialist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for general information only and should not be relied on as a substitute for professional medical advice.

Oy to the World! features Canadian actor Brooke D\u2019Orsay, who has appeared in 10 Christmas-themed movies since 2017 including Deck the Halls on Cherry Lane, Nostalgic Christmas and Christmas in Love. You can\u2019t describe the plots as vanilla as that would be an offence to the vanilla bean. The plot of some Hallmark movies would cause offence to the vanilla bean. Credit: Good Weekend There\u2019s almost always a \u201ccareer-driven\u201d female lead (normally from an evil metropolitan centre like New York) who, for some reason, has to return to an obscure country town. There, she\u2019s likely to face off against a brooding hulk of a gent (with a chance he is a widower). They fight, they resolve, they fall in love. Snow falls and Christmas carols are sung.\n\nLoading So formulaic are these movies, as an experiment, I used AI to see if it could come up with a Hallmark-style Christmas movie but set in an Australian context and featuring a kangaroo. Here\u2019s the plot to \u201cA Dingo Ate My Christmas Spirit\u201d: Chloe Peterson is \u201ca highly successful, driven marketing executive from Sydney\u201d who has a \u201cperfectly un-Christmassy demeanour\u201d. She\u2019s told by her boss to take a digital detox. So Chloe ends up renting a place in a fictional small town north of Brisbane called \u201cJingle Bells Bay\u201d. The rental is double booked, so she has to share with a chap called Liam O\u2019Connell, who is described as a \u201cruggedly handsome, widowed wildlife park ranger\u201d and his daughter Daisy. There\u2019s a kangaroo called Rudolph (he has a medical condition that gives him a red nose) who causes all sorts of trouble around the town.\n\nChloe uses her big-city skills to save Liam\u2019s wildlife sanctuary from closure. Her boss turns up on Christmas Eve to say she\u2019s got a promotion but to get it she has to catch the plane about to leave for Sydney. You know what happens. There\u2019s a spare seat on the direct flight from Jingle Bells Bay to Sydney. Die Hard \u2026 one of the great Christmas movies. But it wouldn\u2019t fit with the AI-generated world of Hallmark. I varied my parameters (including a Hitchcock version, a horror, an action adventure, one set in the South Pole, an Agatha Christie version, one set in space) and they all pumped out variations of my dingo movie. That AI could generate a series of workable plots should not be a surprise. Creating 40 films with a Christmas theme every year invariably means they will look and feel the same. These aren\u2019t destined to win an Oscar \u2013 they are the cheap stocking fillers of film.\n\nLoading But they work for Hallmark and its viewers. These movies are watched (and attract constant ratings on IMDB around 5.5 out of 10) by tens of millions. They make Hallmark, which makes most of these shows in Canada to take advantage of tax concessions and films them on a shoestring, hundreds of millions a year. They\u2019re so popular that next year you can go on a Hallmark Christmas cruise from Florida to the Bahamas. Go onboard to meet some of your favourite Hallmark actors, and enjoy a \u201cSilent Night disco\u201d while swilling a bit of eggnog.\n\nHundreds of actors who would otherwise struggle to afford a gingerbread man make a living frolicking in Hallmark\u2019s fake snow. There\u2019s an entire cottage industry now built on these movies which also extends to social media, where people express their views on all aspects of the Christmas film offerings. You know you\u2019ve reached peak pop culture importance when it crosses over into academia. A Canadian university doctoral student, Megan Lauzier, this year produced a thesis titled More Than Meets the Eye: Unpacking the Popularity of Hallmark Movies. Lauzier argues Hallmark\u2019s social media strategy was a key element to the popularity of \u201cits seemingly unremarkable movies\u201d.\n\nSo predictable are Hallmark movies that Seth MacFarlane used his Family Guy series this year to release a parody with the title \u201cDisney\u2019s Hulu\u2019s Family Guy\u2019s Hallmark Channel\u2019s Lifetime\u2019s Familiar Holiday Movie\u201d. IMDB now lists 503 Hallmark Christmas movies, with the overwhelming majority of them created since 2008. That\u2019s the year after Netflix started its streaming service, a year after Twitter (now X) and a couple of years before Instagram. So formulaic are Hallmark movies that Family Guy this year released its own parody. Credit: Disney+ Pop culture has always been economically driven. But Hallmark and its Christmas movies are at an entirely new level, delivering economic opportunities in ways unimaginable a few years ago. The interaction of technology, tax concessions, streaming services with hours to fill, advertisers looking for specialist markets, real (and artificial) social media influencers is literally playing out on our televisions/handheld devices.",

Got it Share\n\nI\u2019m glad to say that Asian cruising continues to trend, giving cruisers increasing choices over the next two years on all shapes and sizes of ships. If you\u2019re a big-ship enthusiast, then Norwegian Cruise Line, in response to strong demand for Asian cruises, is sending four ships to Asia for a bumper 50-voyage season finishing in April 2027. Norwegian Jade makes its Asian debut in October 2026; guests can embark in Tokyo, Incheon, Hong Kong or Singapore. Norwegian Sky sailing past Mount Fuji in Japan. Princess Cruises will see its biggest Japan season ever in 2027, when Diamond Princess and Sapphire Princess sail 78 departures. Among the highlights are cherry-blossom voyages, a circumnavigation of Japan, and cruises that take in the Okinawa islands and Taiwan. Between November 2026 and March 2027, Diamond Princess will homeport in Singapore and offer 11 sailings to 28 ports across the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Carnival Cruise Line is sending two ships \u2013 Carnival Luminosa and Carnival Adventure \u2013 to Asia for the first time over the 2026-27 season. Although they sail only four itineraries, the move finally recognises Asia as a cruise destination in itself, rather than somewhere to pass through on repositioning cruises. Among the itineraries is Sydney-Singapore, Tokyo-Singapore and a roundtrip voyage from Singapore taking in ports in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. Carnival ships will visit Hong Kong, Osaka, Fukuoka, Seogwipo (Jeju) and Keelung for the first time. Royal Caribbean\u2019s Navigator of the Seas. After an even bigger ship? Royal Caribbean\u2019s Navigator of the Seas will homeport for the first time in Singapore between October 2026 and February 2027 and sail three to 12-night cruises to destinations such as Penang, Phuket, Langkawi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City before heading towards Japan on East Asia itineraries. If it\u2019s a smaller, luxury experience you\u2019re after, Seabourn too is rolling out new Asian voyages between December 2026 and April 2027. Its Japan voyages notably visit not just big-name ports but smaller ones such as Toba, Miyako, Sendai and Hitachinaka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeabourn Encore will also sail a 12-day voyage from Hong Kong to Tokyo, and South-East Asian voyages between Singapore and Hong Kong or round-trip from Singapore. Related Article Cruises This latest cruise company slogan spotlights a cringeworthy tradition The news is just as good for those keen on expedition cruising. New Zealand company Heritage Expeditions is upping its Asian offerings, Lindblad Expeditions is offering diving expeditions in Indonesia from October 2026, and Aqua Expeditions has launched seven-night voyages in South Raja Ampat from December 2026. New Australian expedition company Pearl Expeditions will sail in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea from the end of this year. Coral Expeditions continues to operate throughout Indonesia and is increasing capacity in Papua New Guinea on new itineraries in October and November 2026. And finally, after a five-year pause, G Adventures is returning to Sri Lanka from next month with cruises by catamaran along the southern coast that mix UNESCO-listed port town Galle with remote beaches and fishing village Kudawella for swimming, snorkelling and surfing.\n\nSign up for the Traveller Deals newsletter Get exclusive travel deals delivered straight to your inbox.

    "text": "The mystery box, the deciding half of the contest, was how England\u2019s bowling would go against Australia\u2019s batting (or, as it looked in the first innings in Perth, vice versa). England\u2019s eschewal of spin was not a bad plan. Muttiah Muralitharan was ineffective on Australian pitches, as were Ravi Ashwin, Rangana Herath and Yasir Shah. Anil Kumble, Graeme Swann and Saqlain Mushtaq did passably well. Much has been made of Travis Head\u2019s batting in Perth, but he had plenty of luck, and England\u2019s bowling was awful. Credit: Getty Images Year after year we see that it takes a lifetime of patience and spin bowling smarts in Australian conditions to eke out success. Lacking the required talent, England sensibly opted for pace. The promise was that Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, Brydon Carse, Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, Matthew Potts and Stokes would batter Australia\u2019s brittle top order with speed. They haven\u2019t been good enough or fit enough, and Australia have winkled out winning totals by osmosis. Much has been made, rightly, of Travis Head\u2019s second innings in Perth. He was also streaky and lucky. But England\u2019s bowling was horrible, and if Head hadn\u2019t played that winning knock it\u2019s likely that Steve Smith and the middle order would have found 200 runs between them.\n\nArcher\u2019s lines, as much as his fall in pace, were woeful. Wood was gone. Carse and Atkinson were either confused by poor instructions, tired due to their lack of practice, or too easily discouraged by the counter-attack from Head and Jake Weatherald. In Brisbane and Adelaide, England wilted in the heat and again bowled inconsistent lengths. Archer picked up some wickets through Australian inattention, and bowled fast at times, but the home batsmen were able to see him off, knowing he could not return for good spells. Jofra Archer\u2019s performances have been mixed, at best. Credit: Getty Images They eventually managed it against Jasprit Bumrah last season, and Archer is no Bumrah. The other bowlers were pedestrian. When Alex Carey steadied his partners in Brisbane and Adelaide \u2013 those sequences of play where the Ashes were decided \u2013 England\u2019s bowling did not challenge them consistently. Big Test series are usually won at the margins: dry spells of bowling, tail-end runs and basic fielding.\n\nAustralia\u2019s bottom five partnerships contributed 219 runs in Brisbane and 186 in the first innings in Adelaide. In the field, for every screamer snatched by the Australians, there have been two catches dropped by England. Loading On the third afternoon in Adelaide, when the Ashes were there to be won or lost, Stokes did not bowl, and he gave Archer the ball belatedly and cautiously. He set fields that enabled Head and Carey to rotate the strike at their leisure. When Head was losing concentration, Carey calmed him down, but the task was made easier by England\u2019s sloppy bowling and slackness in the field. What was in Stokes\u2019 mind? He said his body was breaking after his defensive vigil with the bat, and evidently two and a half hours of batting had done Archer in. Yes, it was hot, but try telling Greg Matthews that. In the tied Test in Chennai in 1986, in 50-degree heat, Matthews batted for three hours across both innings and bowled 78 overs, some of them in a vest. Ravi Shastri bowled 61 overs and batted for four hours. The late Dean Jones\u2019 feats have gone down in cricketing folklore and medical literature. Not to say they built them tougher in those days, but still, Stokes\u2019 actions in Adelaide looked very much like a disappointed man throwing a tantrum, or a sulk, against his own teammates.\n\nWhen there is such a difference in outcricket (the basics of bowling and fielding) the one key factor separating Australia and England in these Ashes \u2013 the problem is nearly always leadership. Leadership can\u2019t produce talent from nowhere, but it can set a productive frame of mind, keep spirits high, sustain concentration and control the controllables. Stokes\u2019 brand of leadership has been top-down, bloody-minded and bullying. Whatever speeches he has given, the messages from his performances have been to challenge teammates to follow him and deride them as \u201cweak\u201d if they can\u2019t; to stonewall and take no risks in preserving his own wicket, heaping pressure on the others; and to let his passions override his composure in the field, leading to self-evidently poor tactics, fields that don\u2019t suit his bowlers and emotional decision-making. Ben Stokes\u2019 actions in Adelaide looked very much like a disappointed man throwing a tantrum. Credit: Getty Images Stokes\u2019 personal contributions with bat and ball have been strong, and he is capable of more highlights in Melbourne and Sydney. But runs and wickets are only part of the picture, and when time has passed and players produce their memoirs of this tour, don\u2019t be surprised if there are stories of Stokes going a bit Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now on his team in 2025. His batting, in the series, has been pure Kurtz: \u201cOut there on his own, operating without any decent restraint\u201d. This is not a criticism of the way he has batted per se, but it can only have been read, in his team, as a criticism of them and a withdrawal of the paternal blessings and encouragements he had heaped on them since 2022.\n\nIt is probably a burden of the past. Loading Stokes has been England\u2019s best cricketer and dominant personality, but by now his warrior-exemplar model of captaincy appears to have trapped him. He\u2019s trying to play that Headingley 2019 innings every time: block everything for three hours and demand that someone stays with him. The outrageous luck he received on the field at Headingley and in the 2019 World Cup final left him with a messianic status in English cricket. When he has lived up to it, he has had the attributes of a magical leader who requires from his team only the simple donation of their absolute faith. Whatever trouble they get in, Stokes will save them. It\u2019s been called a cult of personality even by media who have knowingly aided and abetted it. When cults of personality collapse, they do so suddenly and in the most undignified manner.",

    "text": "A US-based representative for the Olayan Group didn\u2019t comment and directed all requests to a Saudi-based spokesperson, who didn\u2019t respond to a detailed list of questions. Most global executives are reluctant to speak about the family for fear of offending the sisters, who are known to fiercely guard their privacy. This story is based on an analysis of the family\u2019s investments, operating companies and filings of family-owned entities, as well as interviews with more than half a dozen people familiar with the group, who asked not to be named discussing information that isn\u2019t public. Wall Street bosses Hutham and Lubna, both in their early seventies, were born in Saudi Arabia to Suliman Olayan. The patriarch was orphaned at a young age and started out working as a dispatcher for the predecessor company of Saudi Aramco, leveraging his fluent English. He mortgaged his house for $US8000 to win a pipeline contract, according to a profile in Time magazine, eventually launching the Olayan Group in 1947. From there, Suliman diversified aggressively, and the group went on to strike partnerships to sell Colgate toothpaste, Oreos and Coca-Cola in the kingdom. He bought US equities to use as credit with American banks and by 1980, his conglomerate brought in more than $US300 million in annual revenue, according to the Time profile.\n\nLoading His globalist bent created a uniquely bi-national empire that the daughters were immersed in early. Both studied in the US and were given significant jobs in the family business on their return. After Suliman\u2019s death in 2002, his son Khaled was named chairman of Olayan Group, but Lubna and Hutham helped run much of the family\u2019s vast operations. Lubna led the Mideast-focused division and Hutham took charge of Olayan America. The sisters married foreigners and took on prominent roles \u2014 Lubna was the first woman elected to the board of a public company in Saudi Arabia in 2004. Even then, women\u2019s rights were severely limited in the kingdom. Only in 2018 were women finally given the right to drive. Low profile In an interview with NPR in 2018, Lubna recalled the difficulty finding a ladies room in factories and boardrooms because there were usually no women. She began approaching government officials and executives for help boosting the female workforce \u2014 all the while being reminded to tread carefully and attempting to avoid confrontation.\n\n\u201cSo, you negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,\u201d she said in the interview about those early efforts. Along the way, the sisters developed reputations for being steely negotiators. Their ascent was aided by an ability to keep a low profile and the duo ensured their business was seen as supportive of the government\u2019s aims. The group is now officially headquartered in Liechtenstein, with offices around the world, including in Athens, where Lubna\u2019s lawyer husband has deep ties. Over the years, the family has gained a reputation for running a stringently professional organisation that\u2019s sophisticated in its dealmaking at a level not typically seen at family offices. The Olayans are deemed richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia\u2019s Warren Buffett. Credit: AP \u201cThe family was very conscious of incorporating corporate governance frameworks into their business, and they did it with a high level of professionalism,\u201d said Josiane Fahed-Sreih, director of the Institute of Family and Entrepreneurial Business at Lebanese American University.\n\nIn one sign of their influence, the Olayan family was untouched in 2017 when dozens of Saudi royals, former officials and businessmen, including Alwaleed, were detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh as the crown prince consolidated power and conducted an unprecedented national shakeup. Investing misstep Alwaleed, worth about $US17 billion these days, has made a comeback of sorts in recent years and his investment group has benefited from the kingdom\u2019s construction frenzy. In the 1990s, the businessman was known for a flamboyant lifestyle, frequently pictured on a private yacht purchased from Donald Trump. The Olayans do things differently. \u201cNormally we don\u2019t seek the limelight\u2026especially anything splashy,\u201d Hutham said about the Olayan family in a speech to the Arab Bankers Association of North America in 2013. \u201cWe avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.\u201d\n\nEven so, there have been investing missteps. A longtime investor in Credit Suisse, they stuck by the bank even through its downturn, ultimately becoming one of the big losers in the turmoil that culminated with UBS Group\u2019s discount purchase of the troubled lender. The losses were at a scale that could roil large financial firms, but one international executive recalls the collapse being treated as a relative non-event within the Olayan Group. The conglomerate continued to execute transactions and payments as normal during the period, the person said. Loading Saudi National Bank, the Swiss lender\u2019s top shareholder, was among firms that lost money on its investment and its chairman resigned in the aftermath. Meanwhile, the Olayans\u2019 profile has only grown in the years since. Key to that are their relationships on Wall Street and within the kingdom, particularly as Riyadh has started to intensify pressure on foreign firms to invest more locally and help diversify the economy.\n\nDespite recent fiscal pressures, Saudi Arabia remains a lucrative market for the titans of global finance: Riyadh ranks as one of the biggest issuers of debt in recent years, while the kingdom\u2019s wealth fund has shown an appetite for blockbuster deals like the recent $US55 billion transaction to take Electronic Arts Inc private. Lubna has close connections to BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink, among others, and was recently named co-chair of the US-Saudi Business Council alongside Citi\u2019s Fraser. Hutham sits on the board of Brookfield, which ranks as one of the biggest private equity investors in the Middle East. Davos in the Desert This year, during Saudi Arabia\u2019s Future Investment Initiative conference, often called Davos in the Desert, Lubna hosted a party in Riyadh that had top global financial executives and officials mingling over canap\u00e9s and rice and lamb, according to one attendee. Their links run broader than just finance. The US equity investments their father started to amass in the 1960s have grown to $US12.7 billion. These days, the portfolio includes stakes in Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. By comparison, Saudi Arabia\u2019s $US1 trillion wealth fund owns just over $US19 billion in US stocks.\n\nThe group\u2019s private equity portfolio forms another large chunk, and is estimated to run into the tens of billions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. Compounded annual growth rate for direct investments has exceeded 30 per cent over a 10-year period, according to its website. The firm\u2019s real-estate holdings span more than 40 million square feet and 40,000 apartments under management. At home, the Olayans have backed the kingdom\u2019s biggest efforts. When Saudi Aramco\u2019s $US25 billion IPO struggled to attract international investors in 2019, the Olayan family was among those tapped locally by the administration of MBS \u2014 as the de facto ruler is called \u2014 to shore up demand. Lubna Olayan has successfully navigated the obstacles for women in the Saudi business world. \u201cYou negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,\u201d she says. Credit: Bloomberg At the same time, the sisters have managed a careful balancing act with their public comments. In 2018, as much of Wall Street avoided the kingdom\u2019s FII conference after Saudi agents murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Lubna used the start of a panel discussion to mourn his death, saying that the act ran counter to Saudi values. \u201cWe are very grateful that the terrible acts reported in recent weeks are alien to our culture and our DNA,\u201d Lubna said in her address.\n\nThese days, Lubna is chair of the Olayan Group\u2019s corporate board, according to a recent press release from the US-Saudi Business Council. Hutham chairs the shareholders\u2019 board, the group\u2019s website says. Day-to-day operations are mostly managed by the likes of Chief Executive Officer Hani Lazkani and Chief Operating Officer Samer Yaghnam, people familiar with the matter said, though the sisters remain the public face of the group and helm broad strategy with family members. Loading Multiple people described Lubna as frank and outgoing, with a reputation for being deeply involved with her investments. Like her father, she\u2019s worldly and warm but also incisive, said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a friend of the late Suliman. \u201cIf you talk with her about current events, it\u2019s not just, \u2018This happened.\u2019 She understands why things are moving the way they are.\u201d Hutham, meanwhile, appears soft-spoken and grandmotherly in conversation, but her line of gentle questioning can elicit small details that can serve as fodder for the negotiating table, according to one international executive.",
