(ABC News: Amelia Walters)\n\nOn the back of the study, the AVA launched a veterinary wellness initiative delivering psychological health and safety awareness training sessions.\n\nIt was made available to 50 workplaces between September 2023 and December 2024.\n\nKelley Johnson, a former veterinary nurse and now manager of a vet hospital in Melbourne, jumped at the opportunity to participate.\n\nShe said the program facilitator had asked her colleagues and staff members questions, and their answers were submitted anonymously before being displayed for all to see.\n\n\"Some of those answers were quite confronting from people who were sitting right next to us,\" Ms Johnson said.\n\n\"I suppose I thought there were a lot of areas where I felt we were doing really well as employers and managers, and we found that we weren't.\n\n\"We discovered that there was conflict that we weren't aware of. There were people that were feeling less than psychologically safe.\"\n\nAVA vice-president Diana Barker said the pilot version of the program had received \"a massive amount\" of positive feedback.\n\nDiana Barker says more mental health support is needed in the veterinary sector. (Supplied: Australian Veterinary Association)\n\nThe AVA has now been awarded a grant of nearly $190,000 from the non-profit Zoetis Foundation to expand its program.\n\n\"This will allow us to expand our Cultivating Safe Teams program, so we intend to make this program available to every single individual veterinary team member in Australia, either online or face-to-face,\" Dr Barker said.\n\nThe grant funds will also be used to develop a program called CST ACTION, intended to help workplaces implement strategies to ensure working as a veterinary professional does not negatively affect mental health.\n\nDr Morrell said he was happy to hear that help was being provided.\n\n\"It's good to see that they're aware of the issue and addressing it, and I hope the people who are in a bad way take advantage of it,\" he said.\n\nThe AVA is planning a second veterinary wellness study for later this year.",

I feel good. \"\n\nAfter she made the lighthouse-adorned rock, 20 kilometres off the south coast of Ireland, she tried to climb up to cheer, but ended up falling back into the water, where she was met by two of her crew who swam over to break the news.\n\n\"The boys just got there and just smothered me, and I hugged them back, and they were like, 'you swam it in 4 hours 57 [seconds],'\" she said.\n\n\"They were just incredible, and I was like, what are you talking about? That's absolutely amazing.\"\n\nAshleigh's dad Mitchell Webb, who was keeping tabs on her swim from Newcastle, said it was incredible to see her achieve that time.\n\n\"She's chuffed at the moment, she's beside herself,\" he said.\n\n\"She's trained hard \u2026 both myself and my wife Lyn, we're very proud.\"\n\nAshleigh Webb's family were there to celebrate her record-breaking feat. (Supplied: Ashleigh Webb)\n\nImportant cause\n\nAshleigh Webb is the founder of The Kallan Lodge Library, a charity that establishes literature and music libraries for young people in mental health facilities.\n\nShe established it with the parents of her close friend Kallan Lodge, who died by suicide at age 21 in 2011.\n\n\"[Kallan] used to drive around listening to music and wondering what made songs mean so much \u2026 and he'd make fun of me for being such a nerd and reading all the time,\" Ashleigh said.\n\n\"Books have always been there for me, music's always there for me, and it has this impact on me that's so significant.\n\n\"When I was 17, I was taken to John Hunter Hospital \u2026 looking back, I just thought about the kids that were in there, and I thought, I can give them some records to listen to and I can give them some books to read.\"\n\nAshleigh Webb is also the founder of mental health charity The Kallan Lodge Library. (Supplied: Ashleigh Webb)\n\nMitchell Webb said literature, music, and swimming have been pivotal to his daughter becoming the woman she was.\n\n\"The charity now has opened up in four hospitals around Australia, for struggling teenage kids,\" he said.\n\nAshleigh said Kallan would be proud to know the impact the service was having.\n\n\"We got a letter from ACT Health after we had put our library into their new mental health facility \u2026 [a young person] had sat for an hour reading a book and afterwards said: 'I forgot how lovely this is. To just sit by a window and read a book.'\"\n\nMore swims planned\n\nAshleigh's next challenge is the Dal Riata swim between Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe swim will be a fundraiser for the libraries and is dubbed \"Do Something Swim\".\n\n\"The sentiment of the Do Something Swim is that people care, but they don't always care to do something about it,\" she said.\n\n\"But people with mental health struggles, all they can do is something.\n\n\"Get up, get dressed, take a shower, get moving. Do something.\n\nAshleigh Webb says she intends to take on another international swim as she continues to raise mental health awareness. (Supplied: Ashleigh Webb)\n\n\" My something is I can swim \u2026 so I'll swim to do something about making these kids time in the facilities just that little bit comfier, and hopefully allow them to dream big for themselves. \"\n\nMitchell said he was \"so incredibly proud\" of Ashleigh's achievements in swimming and mental health advocacy.\n\n\"You see her in tough times and hard times, and she just has this incredible strength that she has to pull herself through,\" he said.\n\n\"People say to me, 'what's her strength?' I say to them, 'well, don't tell her she can't do it because she'll prove you wrong.'\"",

I looked in the rear-view vision mirror and saw flames, so it was then that I went and got a fire unit.\n\n\"All I could see out of my windscreen was orange flames.\n\n\"I immediately turned the ute left and I then got bogged.

I tripped and landed hands-first into the [burning] barley stubble,\" he said.\n\nAfter being found by an employee, he was flown to Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth, where he spent 10 days in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nFor seven of those days, he was in a coma.\n\nAn ambulance was called to Tim Haslam's farm in Popanyinning. (Supplied: Tim Haslam)\n\nWhen Mr Haslam woke, he was told he had suffered 38 per cent burns to his face, arms, legs, hands and feet.\n\n\"I was extraordinarily lucky to be in Fiona Stanley, it is by far the best burns unit in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"[Plastic surgeon and burns specialist] Fiona Wood has done an enormous amount of research since and prior to the Bali bombings.\n\nTim Haslam was airlifted to Perth after the incident.

I've had 15 surgeries, I've lost all the ends of my fingers, the corners of my mouth have also webbed together,\" he said.\n\n\" But I have a fantastic quality of life thanks to the incredible work that Fiona Wood and her team have done. \"\n\nLoading...\n\n'What I should have done differently'\n\nWhen asked how day-to-day operations had changed for him on his farm in Popanyinning, Mr Haslam said they had changed enormously and also very little.\n\n\"I do all my farm jobs. I do them fairly slowly and it is quite painful, but is that age, arthritis or burns-related?\" he said.\n\nThe farmer echoed this year's Farm Safety Week message of second chances and using them as powerful learning opportunities.\n\n\"It happened in an instant and it could happen to you. It changes your life forever. Everyone thinks it would never happen to me,\" he said.\n\n\"Now while I am harvesting, I will always look at the wind direction and where it is coming from.\n\n\"On December 20, 2023, I had a pair of shorts and a short-sleeve shirt on.\n\n\"I urge people for the period of harvest just wear long pants and a long-sleeve shirt.\n\n\"I just simply reacted. What I should have done is sat there for a second and just assessed, 'What are my options?'\"\n\nMr Haslam admitted that stepping out of his vehicle during the fire was a mistake others should learn from.\n\n\"My employee who picked me up could have quite easily run me over, but fortunately the smoke had cleared by then,\" he said.\n\nIn a true show of community spirit, neighbours completed the Haslams' harvest in 2023. (Supplied: Sally Haslam)\n\nLooking out for your neighbours\n\nThe family was just two days off finishing their harvest when Mr Haslam was injured.\n\nAlready a busy time of year for other farmers trying to finish their own harvest, one of his neighbours organised a working bee to get the rest of the crop off.\n\n\"There were four or five headers, trucks. They all turned up to finish off the harvest, and drink my grog,\" Mr Haslam said.\n\n\"My local bowling club also turned up. They were all such incredible support. I refer to them as my bowling family.\n\n\"I had the photos of the harvest hanging in my hospital room. It was a way of keeping me connected to home.\"",

(ABC News: Tobias Hunt )\n\nAt the election in May, federal Labor committed more than $14 million to support bulk-billing GPs in the ACT, on top of national commitments to incentivise more bulk-billing.\n\nBut Mr Barr said the government \"always needs a little more\" federal funding, and stabilising the health system was no exception.\n\n\"We warmly welcome the significant additional investment coming from the federal government into primary health care, including more support for bulk-billing across our community,\" Mr Barr said.\n\n\" [But] our public hospitals do need a further injection of federal funds to help meet this increased demand. \"\n\nNegotiations between the states and territories and the commonwealth on a new five-year National Health Reform Agreement are ongoing.\n\nRachel Stephen-Smith says the commonwealth currently funds less than 35 per cent of the territory's public health system. (ABC News: Michael Barnett)\n\nACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith the territory was pushing for the commonwealth to get back on track to meet a 2023 commitment to fund 45 per cent of the ACT's public health system within 10 years.\n\n\"We currently now, in the ACT under the agreement, are below 35 per cent commonwealth funding, so we are looking to get back on track for that trajectory,\" Ms Stephen-Smith said.\n\n\" I am really confident that we will have achieved substantial progress, and I hope that we will have landed an agreement, by the end of the year. \"\n\nHealth spending now makes up more than a third of the ACT budget and it is projected to grow.\n\nThe territory government's plan to help fund the public health sector with a $250 healthcare levy for all ratepayers was walked back just six days after being proposed when the ACT Greens struck a deal to reduce it to $100 for residential ratepayers.\n\nIt is an example of the reality the ACT government faces now that it is not in coalition with the Greens: It must negotiate with the crossbench.\n\nHousing and infrastructure investments\n\nAndrew Barr says the territory must ensure it has a planning framework in place to handle expected population growth. (ABC News: Toby Hunt)\n\nIn his address, Mr Barr also said the territory government was well on its way to its goal of enabling the construction of 30,000 additional homes in Canberra by 2023.\n\nMr Barr said the city had doubled in size since he began living in it in 1977, and it was going to double again.\n\n\"We need to ensure that we have the planning framework in place to manage that change over the coming decades,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why the government's planning reform agenda combines territory planning reforms, increased land release, and more direct investment from both the territory and commonwealth governments to enable the tens of thousands of new homes that we need to be built.\"\n\nBut he said the government could not just construct more homes and call it a day \u2014 the surrounding community infrastructure had to be built too.\n\n\"This includes projects like new hospitals, community centres, and schools in these new growth areas,\" Mr Barr said.\n\n\"[It also] extends to things that make Canberra a better place to live like the new Canberra Aquatic Centre, the new lyric theatre \u2026 the new convention centre.\n\n\"And that investment in infrastructure will support more jobs in tourism and hospitality.\"\n\n'Australia's most improved city'\n\nAndrew Barr (centre) says Canberra's high quality of life is the result of decades of collective work. (ABC News: Toby Hunt)\n\nIn wrapping up his address, Mr Barr said Canberra being ranked as one of the most liveable cities in the world was \"one of the benefits of long-term Labor governments\".\n\n\"Our city is fairer, more diverse, and a better place to live than it was 25 years ago,\" he said.\n\n\"I like to say that Canberra is Australia's most improved city, and I don't get much disagreement wherever I say that in Australia or around the world.\n\n\"Quality of life means something. It doesn't happen by accident, and it is the result of our collective work over many decades.\n\n\" [If] we keep this up, we will maintain Canberra's reputation as one of the most liveable places on this planet. \"\n\nLabor has been in power in the ACT for almost 24 years.\n\nThe next territory election is not due for another three years, but the annual conference is a chance for the party to cement its platform \u2014 a platform it is hoping Canberrans continue to support.",

She's a hugger, a selfie-taker, an Indigenous art appreciator, and a fan of funky suits.\n\nBut don't let that fool you \u2014 the former lawyer and AFL commissioner certainly understands how to make an impact.\n\n\"I have no political role, I have no politics, I have no policies of my own,\" she tells ABC TV's Compass.\n\n\"But I can talk about those [I] visit back to those that have some say.\n\n\" My job is to represent all Australians \u2026 to tell stories to reflect that light and shade, and to celebrate the very best of what I see. And there's enormous power in that. \"\n\nFrom day one, Ms Mostyn put that power to use.\n\nAt her inauguration, for instance, she donned a striking blue suit with wattle pinned to the lapel.\n\nIt was crafted by The Social Outfit, a Sydney-based social enterprise that employs migrant women who can sew and offers a pathway to economic stability.\n\n\"We had the young Chinese migrant woman who made my suit come to my swearing-in ceremony,\" she says.\n\nSam Mostyn says her experience chairing boards, as AFL commissioner and as the inaugural commissioner with the National Mental Health Commission taught her the importance of connection and understanding. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nInitially a customer and now The Social Outfit's patron, Ms Mostyn says she's drawn to the organisation's ethos and the way it addresses gaps in essential services.\n\n\"I'd been very aware of [Australia's] settlement services, particularly for women, particularly if they were partners of those that had come in on migrant visas,\" she says.\n\n\"Often those women did not have their own agency or ability to earn or get their own education.\"\n\nAnd that's why The Social Outfit is so effective.\n\n\"The money that is made is all ploughed back into education and TAFE programs for [employees] to have job security in the fashion industry,\" Ms Mostyn says.\n\n\"I am very proud that I played that role as patron.\"\n\nSam Mostyn (centre) is a longtime supporter of The Social Outfit. (Image: Supplied)\n\nChampioning 'the best of Australia'\n\nWhile a carefully chosen suit beamed onto television screens around the country might be one way of being visible, Ms Mostyn's embrace of social media is another.\n\nShe regularly films behind the scenes of her meetings and events, and provides explanations on what different awards and ceremonies mean.\n\nShe sees it as an opportunity to champion Australia.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"Increasingly, I'm using small films and vignettes when I meet someone to tell their story,\" she says.\n\n\"To put that up on our social media to say, 'Look at this person. This is the best of Australia.'\n\n\"And it might be in a country town, it might be in a city, it might be a remote community, it might be in Abu Dhabi, it might be in Gallipoli.\"\n\nThis extends to celebrating acts of goodwill from the business sector.\n\n\"Whether it's philanthropy or those that have been successful and support our sporting aspirations, who support those in the disability community, who support programs that wouldn't be funded otherwise, I think that part of my job is to go and find those stories,\" she says.\n\nFrom what she can tell, this approach is working.\n\n\"Wherever I go, in almost every part of the world \u2026 there'll be someone who has a family member as part of a diaspora community in Australia, one of the most successful multicultural nations,\" she says.\n\n\"People really admire the deep First Nations history that we celebrate here.\n\n\"They admire the fact that we have such a successful, vibrant democracy, independent judiciary, [and] that we feel like a safe, stable place.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the governor-general spent time at the Wyanga Aboriginal Aged Care in Sydney's Redfern.\n\nThe organisation provides home care services to elders, with the aim of keeping culture and community strong.\n\nWyanga Aboriginal Aged Care is based in Sydney's inner-city suburb of Redfern. (Facebook: Governor-General of Australia)\n\nFor Ms Mostyn, the visit was about listening to the needs of staff members and elders alike.\n\n\"One of the things I can do \u2014 I speak to ministers and I speak to the prime minister \u2014 I can share stories of success,\" she told the group.\n\n\"For me, that starts with care, and the care that you show. You don't just show it to your own community, it extends to everyone you come into contact with.\"\n\nFinding joy in the job\n\nIndeed, care is a value that Ms Mostyn puts at the centre of her work.\n\nIt's a message she leant into during her inauguration speech in July 2024.\n\n\"Care has a deep and resonant place in our Australian identity,\" she said at the time. \"Care is the gentle thought and the outstretched hand that Australians have always been ready to share when great challenges present themselves. Care is the quieter, better part of ourselves.\"\n\nSince that day, she's sworn in the 31st prime minister of Australia, represented the Australian people at the ANZAC commemoration ceremony at Gallipoli, and attended the funeral for Pope Francis.\n\nSam Mostyn swears in Anthony Albanese as prime minister.\n\nBut when the prime minister asked her to accept the role, she hesitated before saying yes.\n\n\"I did ask him about why he had approached me, why he thought I would be capable of doing the job and what it said about Australia,\" Ms Mostyn recalls.\n\n\"He said ultimately it's time to have a modern, visible and optimistic governor-general who can effectively go out to the country and talk a lot about our constitutional underpinnings and the vibrancy of our democracy and our nation today.\"\n\nWhile the PM's endorsement no doubt helped sway her decision, Ms Mostyn actually credits her daughter with convincing her to say yes to the job.\n\n\"She was watching [my husband] Simeon and I talking about what it would mean, the upheaval, the capacity \u2026 She quietly sat there and then just said, 'Will it make you happy?'\" she recalls.\n\n\"Thank goodness for our children, and the wisdom of younger people saying, 'You won't do the job well if it doesn't make you happy.'\n\n\" There is a deep sense of happiness in me, that [I] can do something good in this role. \"\n\nSam Mostyn is married to Simeon Beckett SC, and they have an adult daughter, Lotte. (Image: Supplied)\n\nA woman in power\n\nAs only the second woman to serve as governor-general, Ms Mostyn's appointment was not without controversy.\n\nFrom her salary to her qualifications to her political views, she has weathered a storm of criticism since accepting the position.\n\n\"A lot of people were very angry,\" she says.\n\n\"They didn't think a woman could do this job. They didn't think someone who wasn't [an army] general could do this job.\n\n\" I wasn't going to let the gender issue stop me saying yes to the job. \"\n\nSam Mostyn graduated from the Australian National University with an arts law degree. (Image: Supplied)\n\nMs Mostyn believes gender and background shouldn't be barriers to participating in high office if someone has the necessary skills, attributes and commitment.\n\nAnd, despite her detractors, she knew she was qualified.\n\n\"I think when you're asked to serve that you have to actually believe you can serve,\" she says.\n\n\"I had to reflect deeply with my husband and my daughter about whether I was capable of stepping into this role because of both the expectations, but also whether I have the legitimate right to be here and to represent Australians in this role.\n\n\"I've come to the view that I do, but I come to it from a particular set of insights.\"\n\nAs the eldest of four daughters in a military family, Ms Mostyn's upbringing instilled in her a value of service.\n\n\"My dad's now in his 90s, but he served in the Australian Army for 40 years, and my sisters and I and my mum were all part of a defence family,\" she says.\n\n\" So we grew up with a sense of service that I'm not sure I could do this job without. \"\n\nSam Mostyn grew up in Canberra as the eldest of four girls. (Image: Supplied)\n\nLooking ahead and disagreeing well\n\nFor the years ahead \u2014 she has a five-year term to serve, after all \u2014 Ms Mostyn hopes Australia continues to lead the way on issues of diplomacy and \"the great Australian value \u2026 of respectfully disagreeing, and disagreeing well\".\n\nShe believes it's essential for our politicians and leaders to model this.\n\n\"If we send a message out to the general public that it is OK to be violent, to be angry, to make it personal, I worry that we will lose something that is uniquely Australian,\" she says.\n\n\"We see many conflicts around the world that come back into our diaspora communities, and I spend time in those communities. I know the leaders of those communities do not want to bring those debates and those issues here.\n\n\" But if we allow disinformation, misinformation \u2026 and stop [approaching] an issue with understanding and respect, it worries me that we could descend quite quickly \u2014 as other parts of the world have \u2014 into tearing ourselves apart where we don't need to. \"\n\nQueen Camilla joins Governor-General Sam Mostyn on her trip to Australia. (AAP: Brook Mitchell)\n\nDespite this note of caution, the governor-general remains one of Australia's biggest advocates.\n\n\"It's been a year of immense privilege and honour,\" she says.\n\n\"I have travelled almost every part of the country. I've learned more about myself and learned more about Australia and Australians.\n\n\" It's extraordinary to be a person who bears witness, close up and personal, with the people that make our Australian story so great. \"\n\nWatch The Governor-General One Year On with Geraldine Doogue on Compass tonight at 6:30pm on ABC TV and iview.",

    "text": "Australia's vast distances are perhaps the reason the idea of the cross-country trek \u2014 in the form of a convoy, a cavalcade or a relief column \u2014 has imprinted its tracks so deeply into the nation's collective consciousness.\n\nThe inland mission of Burke and Wills met with disaster, but when the doomed duo left Melbourne months earlier in August 1860, the stately tread of their travelling party's horses and camels was accompanied by the cheers of a 15,000-strong crowd.\n\nThe men were in search of pastures green \u2014 a sight that has, of late, been a little hard to come by across swathes of southern Australia.\n\nThe painting Memorandum of the Start of the Exploring Expedition, in the Art Gallery of South Australia's collection, is from around the time Burke and Wills set off. (Wikimedia Commons/Art Gallery of South Australia)\n\nFor months, drought has been ravaging the continent's temperate zone, leaving many South Australian farmers without water and fodder, and there is a prevailing sense of a final straw.\n\nBut, in time-honoured tradition, help has been on the way \u2014 and it has been coming from way out west.\n\nAlong the Eyre Highway and across the Nullarbor Plain, a veritable \"hay fever\" of sorts has broken out.\n\nFor the past two days, a convoy that would stretch an estimated 3 kilometres if all its trucks were lined up bumper-to-bumper has been bringing thousands of bales of fodder from Western to South Australia.\n\nOrganisers estimate the convoy would extend more than 3 kilometres if lined up bumper-to-bumper. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\n\"This is logistically the biggest hay run ever and it is a massive machine,\" convoy participant Karen Smith said.\n\n\" Every bale and every person and every kilometre travelled and every little part of this moving machine that makes it all go around \u2014 all of those little important parts make it happen. \"\n\nThe enterprise has been not so much a \"bailout\" as a \"bales on\" \u2014 on, that is, to the backs of the approximately 85 trucks that are now destined for 400 farming businesses across Eyre Peninsula, the Adelaide Hills and other South Australian regions that have been battling the impact of the drought.\n\nWhen Ms Smith \u2014 who runs a transport business in Esperance \u2014 got wind of what was brewing, she knew she had to be involved.\n\nKaren Smith is proud to have taken part in the logistically complex operation. (ABC News)\n\n\"We were on a holiday in the Kimberleys up north and we cut it short to do this trip because it's very important to us,\" she said.\n\n\"This is our third hay run \u2026 [and] once you get involved, that's it \u2014 it's kind of like a lifetime membership.\n\n\"It's addictive in that you just love the fact that Aussies are helping Aussies, and I guess in this case it's farmers helping farmers, but you've also got the transport industry, which is obviously what helps get it there.\"\n\n'Always been the Australian spirit'\n\nThe convoy is the brainchild of two charities, Farmers Across Borders and Need for Feed, and support has also been provided by the South Australian government.\n\nTransport costs have been covered by $2 million from the state's drought relief fund.\n\nAnyone overlooking the trucks before they set off from Norseman in WA on Friday might have been struck by their resemblance to a giant cattle drive or muster \u2014 the vehicles and their cargo of provender were packed together like sheep in a pen.\n\nThe convoy assembled at WA's Fraser Range Station over the past week. (ABC News: Mark Bennett)\n\nBut when they hit the road, they quickly metamorphosed into a narrow column.\n\nAs that column arrived to a warm welcome in Ceduna on SA's west coast on Saturday afternoon, it presented the kind of spectacle that might have sparked the imagination of Henry Lawson, had the bush poet been born into the age of the B-double and the dual carriageway.\n\n\"We've got truckies here from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia,\" said Need for Feed chair Graham Cockerell as he refuelled his truck in Ceduna.\n\n\"Ceduna is probably the first of the real welcoming committee but there's been a few farmers come out onto the road, which is a bit emotional for us.\n\n\"We're blown away by that \u2014 by the level of support right from the top downwards.\"\n\nNeed for Feed chair Graham Cockerell (centre) has taken a prominent role in the convoy. (Facebook: Need for Feed Australia)\n\nAmong the army of drivers is Shepparton truckie and hay run veteran Andrew Linehan, who left for WA nine days ago in order to participate in the operation.\n\nFor him, the chief appeal of the enterprise is the camaraderie afforded by the open road.\n\n\"It's always been a bit of fun \u2014 you get to catch up with some like-minded people as well, and you get the added bonus of helping somebody out who's struggling a little bit,\" he said.\n\n\" I get the impression that remote farmers would potentially feel a bit isolated, and this is just a way of showing them that people know what they're going through and care enough to help. \"\n\nProgress was painstaking \u2014 rain meant the drivers had to take extra care on the road.\n\nAlong roadsides, wellwishers gathered to salute the convoy. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nWhile some noted the irony of delivering drought relief amid downpours, Adelaide truckie David Aylett was delighted that the convoy had coincided with the wintry weather.\n\n\"It's bringing the rain, which we need in South Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"The farmers \u2014 they do it tough at times, and it's just good to do a bit for the country.\n\n\" We're here to help one another, and that's always been the Australian spirit. I think over the years we've lost a little bit of that and it'd be good to get it back. \"\n\nBut some of that spirit was very much on show along roadsides, where smiling, waving and cheering wellwishers gathered to salute the convoy.\n\n\"You just see people out there who've got so much joy on their faces,\" Mr Aylett said.\n\n\"It tingles down your spine, basically.\"\n\nAmong those greeting the group was Ceduna resident of 14 years Karen Toft.\n\nKaren Toft says Australians have a proud tradition of stepping up in times of crisis. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nStanding on the edge of the Eyre Highway, she was draped in an Australian flag, which she eagerly held aloft with the passing of each hay truck.\n\n\"I think it's a big moment,\" she said with both local and national pride.\n\n\"This is just really amazing \u2014 an amazing logistical exercise to get all these trucks through a small town, in Ceduna.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary thing, this is what people do, Australians do, in times of need \u2014 everyone steps up, and this is part of it.\"\n\n'Would have had quite a shortage of milk'\n\nOn the farmers' side of the fence, there is a strong sense of appreciation, but it is being tempered by caution.\n\nAmid heavy rain on Friday, grain growers told the ABC that it was far too soon to be talking about recovery.\n\nMore than 6,000 bales of hay and straw will be moved across SA. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\n\"One rain doesn't break a drought,\" one said.\n\n\"We'll still need follow-up, and we'll need a very kind spring to make a season of it.\"\n\nIt's a message the state government understands.\n\n\"The rains have come very, very late, which means that a lot of people either sowed crops which then got blown away or didn't grow or have had to re-sow, or both,\" Primary Industries Minister Clare Scriven said.\n\n\"What this rain means is I think some hope for our farmers, who have been doing it so, so tough, but it means still that there is a long way to go.\n\n\"We've been very, very grateful for the partnership with the charities.\"\n\nDespite the recent rain, farmers remain desperate for strong falls in coming weeks. (ABC North and West SA: Viki Ntafillis)\n\nSA Dairyfarmers' Association president Robert Brokenshire said the deliveries of donated hay would make a difference at a difficult time for many.\n\n\"If the state government didn't have a freight subsidy package \u2014 and if we weren't getting Need for Feed and others bringing in this fodder, frankly \u2014 sadly, some banks would be knocking on the doors, I'd suggest, of some farmers, because it's that tight,\" he said.\n\n\"Many dairy farmers would have had to dry their cows off or indeed sell cows, and we probably would have had quite a shortage of milk to supply South Australia.\n\n\"It's really been exhausting financially and mentally, so the government being behind us and the volunteer organisations \u2026 are an absolute saviour.\"\n\n'That means the world to me'\n\nThe convoy has now reached its final destination in the township of Wudinna, on Eyre Peninsula's wheatbelt, but the job is hardly over.\n\nIn fact, the most important stage has not yet begun.\n\n\"We've brought just over 6,400 bales,\" Need for Feed chair Graham Cockerell said.\n\n\"We've actually had to rejig some of our deliveries because it's too wet to get in on the farms.\"\n\nFrom Sunday, the trucks will go their separate ways to deliver fodder across SA. (Facebook: Need for Feed Australia)\n\nFrom Wudinna, the vehicles will go their separate ways, taking their fodder in all directions.\n\n\"It'll get distributed throughout different parts of South Australia,\" driver Andrew Linehan said.\n\n\"We could end up down the other side into the Adelaide Hills or into the outback areas.\"\n\nTowards the fateful end of their journey, Burke and Wills were famously confronted by the word \"DIG\" on a tree along the Cooper Creek \u2014 a message pointing them in the direction of buried supplies.\n\nIt was not enough to save them.\n\nBut digging deep in times of crisis is something that rural communities pride themselves on \u2014 a point made by many involved in this weekend's hay convoy.\n\n\"It means everything,\" Karen Smith said.",

In a common-sense world, the Jac Morgan cleanout on Carlo Tizzano in the dying moments of the Wallabies\u2019 29-26 shouldn\u2019t be a penalty - the Welshman was low enough to generate the power to drive through Tizzano and get him off the ball.\n\nBut that is not the way rugby has been officiated for years. Anyone who has watched any volume of rugby for the past six years has seen similar incidents, or less, pored over incessantly by TMOs, producing penalties or even cards. Fans know, coaches know it and players know it - in fact TMOs are obliged to come in if a player is exhibiting signs of head contact. It was therefore an extraordinary moment for rugby to rediscover its common sense, and that is why former Wallabies and Lions were vehemently opposed in their reading of the incident - in a sense they were both right.\n\nOne of the match officials, Ben O\u2019Keeffe, could be heard on the microphone saying, \u201cThere may have been head contact but there was no foul play\u201d. Wallabies captain Harry Wilson produced one of the greatest leaves in MCG history when he opted not to comment on the incident post-match. There was little wonder the bloke was confused and upset.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Jakarta\u2019s traffic makes the peak-hour crawl in Sydney or Melbourne seem like a hypersonic pleasure trip. The sun is often blotted out by smog. The city\u2019s pollution, caused not just by cars and bikes but by coal-fired power plants, consistently ranks as the worst in the world on real-time charts. Indonesian businesses see opportunity in this situation and in the millions of drivers for delivery and taxi companies that contribute to the clogged streets and the murky air in Indonesia\u2019s biggest city (population 36 million). So does Australia. It has made a $5 million concessional loan to Indonesian electric motorbikes rental company Electrum, which is pitching to these drivers to switch from fossil fuels to electric vehicles, and is backed by some heavy-hitting Indonesian corporates. The Electrum loan is part of a new dawn in solar-powered diplomacy that is rising as Australia\u2019s foreign aid programs switch tack to boost green business growth in Indonesia, our most important regional ally. Jakarta has serious smog problems. Credit: Bloomberg The revamped aid approach is designed to tackle some of the low-income nation\u2019s most pressing problems and address an uncomfortable question for Australia: Why should countries such as Indonesia cut emissions and miss the economic benefits of polluting industries that enriched wealthy nations? Made wealthy by coal and gas exports, Australia is seeking to burnish its climate-action credentials by funding prospective green businesses that will help Indonesia\u2019s government juggle the goals of economic growth and pollution reduction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into KINETIK, that\u2019s the Indonesian acronym for the Australia Indonesia Climate, Renewable Energy and Infrastructure Partnership program. The Electrum loan is part of KINETIK\u2019s portfolio. Electrum\u2019s chief executive Jack Yang said the company\u2019s growth was fuelled by the Indonesian government\u2019s recognition that transport was a key tool for climate action. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear direction there, and there\u2019s a wide range of initiatives in place and urban mobility is one of them.\u201d Electrum chief executive Jack Yang at the company\u2019s Jakarta depot. Credit: Jefri Tarigan. Electric motorbikes could deliver about 20 per cent in savings compared with petrol-powered bikes, including the costs of Electrum\u2019s swap-and-go battery system, Yang said. Designed to make charging convenient for busy riders, vending machines installed across the city enable busy riders to lift spent batteries out of their bike and swap them for fully charged replacements. Electrum has rented out about 5000 bikes in Jakarta and Yang said the growth potential was massive given there was a total of 17 million motorbikes on the road across the city. The environmental benefits are high too; transport generates about one-quarter of all Indonesia\u2019s pollution, 95 per cent of which comes from road vehicles. Electrum is backed by Indonesia\u2019s giant state-owned energy company PLN (Perusahaan Listrik Negara) in partnership with Jakarta\u2019s dominant ride-hailing and delivery company, Gojek. Yang said investors in Indonesian businesses were prepared to pay a premium to put their money into cleaner technologies. \u201cIf you diversify into clean energy technology, then you actually have a much higher premium. That means the shareholders are speaking that they want energy companies to consider new sustainable cleaner source of energy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarnessing that investment return is one reason for the creation of KINETIK. The other, as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says, is that Australia views Indonesia as \u201ccritical to navigating this time of global uncertainty\u201d. \u201cI am here in Indonesia because no relationship is more important to Australia than this one,\u201d Albanese said in Jakarta in May, on his first foreign visit since his election win. Prabowo and Albanese exchange soccer jerseys during the prime minister\u2019s visit in May. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen KINETIK is not bankrolling initiatives such as a traditional aid program, but is investing in businesses and entrepreneurs. Its goal is to invest its initial $200 million endowment in businesses that generate returns that can be pumped back into the other green ventures. \u201cWe know that grants from government are never going to be sufficient to fully address the climate challenge, so it is critical to be able to stand up financing mechanisms to support solutions addressing the climate crisis,\u201d said Kylie Charlton, a committee member of Australia Development Investments, a government investment vehicle that provides funding for KINETIK. Charlton is also managing director of Australian Impact Investments. Indonesia has committed under the Paris Agreement on climate change to cut emissions 32 per cent below business-as-usual by 2030 and to reach net zero emissions by 2060. Switching to cleaner energy is a challenge for Indonesia given the nation has imposed local content laws designed to tackle poverty by boosting local manufacturing to increase jobs and boost the economy. This will increase reliance on electricity, which is almost entirely supplied by coal-fired power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May, KINETIK announced a $15 million investment in Indonesian company Hijau, that installs and rents rooftop solar panels to commercial customers such as shopping malls. Independent committee member of Australia Development Investments Jeremy Cleaver said Hijau was selected for its ability to generate a return, which would fuel further financing deals. \u201cThis is an equity investment for Hijau, so it does not need to be paid back. But at some point, the investment will need to be sold, and hopefully, the fund will make a return, to later be invested in other opportunities,\u201d Cleaver said.

Hangga Fathana, assistant professor of international relations at Universitas Islam Indonesia, said Australia\u2019s investment strategy could strengthen the relationship with the Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto\u2019s government by offering opportunities that were not available from other regional partners who were seeking strategic alignment with Indonesia. \u201cChina offers capital, Korea and Japan come to Indonesia with technology and loans and Australia is offering trust, collaboration and values,\u201d Fathana said. However, Australia faces challenges under Prabowo\u2019s goal to boost downstreaming \u2013 or investment in a wide range of local value-add industries such as minerals processing, manufacturing and agriculture. \u201cAny green initiative like what has been done by the Australian government, no matter how noble it is, is competing with this strong pull towards short-term economic gains.\u201d China\u2019s influence on Indonesian policymaking was \u201cquite contentious\u201d, Fathana said, arguing that Australia stick to its strategy. \u201cAustralia needs to show what we call consistency and patience,\u201d he said. China may achieve short-term results, but trust building could pay off in the long term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s subtle but powerful especially for the younger generations of Indonesia who are more aware and more concerned about climate issues.\u201d KINETIK is also backing Indonesian renewable power company Xurya. It builds green power supply, largely for foreign companies operating in Indonesia. Australia has invested more than $4 million in Asian fund manager Clime Capital and $8 million in AC Ventures, both of which have funded the company, which began seven years ago by installing solar panels on commercial premises such as factories and shopping malls under a zero-cost upfront leasing arrangement. Clime Capital\u2019s Indonesia country manager John Colombo (left) and the managing director of Xurya, Eka Himawan. Credit: Jefri Tarigan. Xurya managing director Eka Himawan said foreign companies were motivated by their commitment to climate action to reduce their reliance on Indonesia\u2019s coal-powered grid by installing solar panels, rather than economic factors. \u201cUsually, there\u2019s another driving factor behind it,\u201d Himawan said. He said Indonesia\u2019s state-owned electricity supplier PLN was also working with Xurya to wean smaller islands off diesel fuel. While the islands of Borneo and Java are powered by coal, smaller islands such as Sulawesi rely on diesel generators. \u201c[Diesel power] is expensive, and it\u2019s very dirty,\u201d Himawan said. \u201cThere\u2019s an economic driver for PLN to start looking at solar for more remote islands.\u201d AC Ventures managing partner Helen Wong said ructions caused by the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal of United States funding from international climate initiatives created a major headache for decarbonisation in low-income economies such as Indonesia.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "DW: Why did it come to an end?\n\nTS: The role ended for me before the 2025 season even began \u2013 but I only found that out because I reached out to them. No one from Fox had contacted me during the off-season, so two weeks before Round 1, I emailed to check in and confirm everything was good to go. That\u2019s when I was told they were using a \u201ccross-code resource\u201d instead, due to budgeting reasons tied to the pending sale of the business (to DAZN). I was disappointed, but what stung more was that there was never any intention to let me know. After telling me I was no longer doing the NZ sideline role, they said they\u2019d let me know when other opportunities came up for me. So when I moved to Sydney shortly after and let them know I was available for any other opportunities, I still believed there was an open door. But instead, a few weeks later, I read an anonymous quote from a senior Fox source in the Daily Mail saying I no longer worked for the network \u201cin any capacity\u201d. That was the first and only confirmation I had that the relationship was fully over. It was a devastating way to find out. Response from Fox Sports managing director Steve Crawley At 11.51 am on February 27 this year in response to an email received two days earlier asking if she would be required for sideline reporting from New Zealand in the coming rugby league season, Tiffany Salmond was informed by the Fox Sports executive producer that no there was no role for her and if that were to change he would be in contact. We have no further comment.\n\nDW: What opportunities have come your way since?\n\nTS: In the rugby league media space, no new opportunities have come my way since. Tiffany Salmond has spoken about her departure from Fox League. DW: Why have you struggled to land a role?\n\nTS: That\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not due to lack of audience support \u2013 that\u2019s been overwhelming. It\u2019s not about performance, talent or knowledge either; I have been publicly praised for all of these attributes and internally praised as well. I can only speculate why no one has made the logical decision to hire me. Rugby league media is very conservative when it comes to female representation. The men are allowed to be edgy, loud, have huge personalities and take up space. But women have to toe the line of being attractive \u2013 but not too sexy. Knowledgeable \u2013 but not enough to outshine your male counterparts. Unfortunately for me, the audience became so loud about my presence that it became clear \u2013 that if I gained any more airtime, I was going to outgrow the sideline role.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to realise is that sometimes, when you don\u2019t fit a traditional mould \u2013 especially as a woman in rugby league \u2013 you become harder for the system to place. I\u2019m not a former player. I\u2019m not someone\u2019s daughter. I didn\u2019t come through the usual production lines. I\u2019m a girl from New Zealand, with a unique perspective on the game, who built my own audience, my own voice, and I didn\u2019t shrink myself to be palatable. And while that resonates deeply with viewers, it can challenge the old structures behind the scenes. I disrupted the hierarchy behind how this type of role is usually played. I blew the lid off the expectations they had of me \u2013 in the best way possible \u2013 but I guess they wanted safe, and predictable, not explosive and exciting. DW: Do you feel you have been treated unfairly by Fox?\n\nTS: Yes, I do. I was never told I was being removed from the New Zealand sideline role. I\u2019ve received no support or protection in the face of rumours that were created by others. I was left to manage the fallout entirely on my own, while others were protected \u2013 including some whose actions impacted me. Over time, I became increasingly isolated from the team, despite doing everything right and going above and beyond in my role.\n\nSo yes, I believe I was treated unfairly. Not just in how things ended, but in how I was left out, unsupported, and ultimately erased without explanation. DW: What support have you had from other NRL presenters?\n\nTS: None. Not a single one has reached out to me, publicly or privately. And yet, they\u2019ve watched on. While I was doing something bold and different \u2013 I saw them silently keeping tabs. Views on stories, saving my videos, and quiet monitoring. But never a word. No message of support. No check-in. Not during the rise, and not during the fallout. But they\u2019re still watching, even now. That silence has been loud. I\u2019ve realised not everyone wants the system to shift. DW: How many jobs have you applied for?\n\nTS: In this industry, especially as on-air talent, you don\u2019t apply for roles the way you would in a traditional job market. There are only a handful of networks with rugby league rights, and these roles aren\u2019t advertised; they\u2019re cast. It\u2019s about relationships, timing, and internal politics.\n\nI\u2019ve made myself available. I\u2019ve stayed visible. I\u2019ve had meetings. I was told by Triple M I\u2019d get more shifts when I moved to Sydney \u2013 that didn\u2019t happen. I met with Channel 9 \u2013 nothing came from it. But more importantly, I\u2019ve continued to build public momentum. My name has been consistently in the conversation. The audience support and demand for my return have been loud. And that\u2019s what makes the silence even more glaring. At the height of my relevance, when I was resonating with fans and making an impact, I should have been snapped up. Meanwhile, there are men in this industry who\u2019ve done genuinely egregious things \u2013 been publicly fired \u2013 and still walked straight into jobs at rival networks. The fact that I\u2019ve been completely overlooked \u2013 after all that I\u2019ve built \u2013 says everything. It\u2019s an ugly stain on rugby league media. And everyone who\u2019s stayed silent is complicit in letting it sit there. DW: Are you concerned that by reposting positive feedback that employers could be turned off?\n\nTS: In what world does positive audience feedback turn employers off? If anything, that should be the most valuable signal that someone is resonating and connecting with the public. I didn\u2019t start reposting comments or speaking out until I realised I was already being intentionally iced out. No one was coming my way. No one was reaching out. My hand was forced. Not because I wanted attention, but because it became clear that if I stayed silent, they would\u2019ve successfully erased me.\n\nI\u2019m not the one who made this messy; I\u2019m just the one who finally said it out loud. I\u2019ve simply shone a light on what\u2019s already been happening. And if that makes people uncomfortable, it says more about them than it does about me. Warriors home matches were once the workplace of Tiffany Salmond. DW: It was written that you are a victim of a boys\u2019 club in rugby league. Is this the case?\n\nTS: Yes, 100 per cent. What else could possibly explain it? A rising breakout talent, praised for performance, deep game knowledge, and a unique perspective. Someone who built her own audience, drove ratings, brought in new viewers, and was the sole reason many people tuned in at all. And is still completely iced out of the industry. No formal explanation. No public misstep. No lack of demand. Over a year later, I still receive constant messages asking where I am and why I haven\u2019t been brought back. So if it\u2019s not the boys\u2019 club, then genuinely, I\u2019d love to hear what it is.\n\nAnd the shame of it all is that a small group of men in power are actively blocking the game from reaching a new level and a new audience. They talk about wanting to break into the American market \u2013 I already have an American audience. They found me through sideline photos and content, and they stayed. They\u2019ve been introduced to the game because of me. American sports culture doesn\u2019t want bland. It wants bold, flashy, magnetic. That\u2019s exactly what I brought, and they noticed. But now, I\u2019m not there to introduce them to rugby league any more. And the fact that the NRL hasn\u2019t stepped in to fix that \u2013 to ask why one of their most resonant new voices has been iced out \u2013 is honestly shocking. Because this isn\u2019t just a missed opportunity for me. It\u2019s a missed opportunity for the sport. DW: Did a late-night phone call to a Fox reporter work against you?\n\nTS: The phone call situation that was reported wasn\u2019t the reason I was removed. But once I started gaining visibility and attention, it felt like that moment became an easy narrative to use against me \u2013 despite senior staff being completely unfazed by it when it happened.\n\nI was told by someone else in the team that senior management laughed it off. I was then rostered for the entire season of Warriors\u2019 home games. I want to make it very clear: it was an innocent phone call I made all the way from New Zealand, to a colleague I considered a friend. He had also made it very clear to me that he was single, so I saw no issue in calling him for a chat while I was on my way home from a night out. Unfortunately, I had obviously been misled, and I copped the backlash publicly for something I was a victim in, too. I was left to carry the full weight of the fallout alone.\n\nDW: Are you angry at how you have been portrayed?\n\nTS: Of course, I am. I did everything right. I came prepared, knowledgeable, efficient, easy to work with, friendly to chat with, easy to get along with. I was loved by the audience and brought a fresh, new perspective to the game. I stayed quiet when I needed to, even when it cost me personally. I toed the line when it mattered. And still, this happened to me. I\u2019m trying to move on, but the weight of it all is heavy. Because when I sit with what\u2019s happened \u2013 the cruelty, the injustice \u2013 it kills me. It\u2019s unbearable. And what\u2019s worse? No one in the industry seems to care. DW: Do you fear you will never get the chance to work again?\n\nTS: I\u2019ve accepted that I probably won\u2019t work in rugby league media again \u2013 at least not the way it\u2019s currently run or with the people who hold the broadcast rights. I came to terms with that not long after moving to Sydney. Back then, I thought maybe they just didn\u2019t realise how much the audience connected with me. But in time, I saw the truth. They did see it, they just didn\u2019t care. And they didn\u2019t want any part of it. I love rugby league. It will always be part of who I am. But I\u2019ve had to let go of trying to belong somewhere that never protected me, never valued me, and ultimately chose to exclude me.\n\nI\u2019m taking my time with what\u2019s next. I\u2019m not chasing a quick fix. I know what I\u2019ve built with my audience, and I want to move forward in a way that honours that. I\u2019m confident that where I eventually land will be bigger, better, and backed by a team that gets it. Lachlan Galvin celebrates his match-winning play against the Dragons. Credit: Getty Images Galvin becoming top Dog at Belmore Lachlan Galvin is not Johnathan Thurston, but he is playing with the same energy and involvement as the great man. He had 77 touches in his first game as the Bulldogs\u2019 No.7. The last was as a match-winner, which is the kind of mark Thurston would make in a game. News Corp\u2019s selective reporting and rewriting of history when it comes to Galvin and the Bulldogs is noticeable. One veteran scribe suggested the recruit needed to play the season in reserve grade, while in the same breath, was trying to claim credit for saying he would be the team\u2019s first grade No.7 last week.\n\nHe also gave stats as to why Toby Sexton should not be in the team. The flipping and flopping on that matter is impossible to follow. At least some of his colleagues are now calling him out on this. The selective reporting continued when it came to giving Sexton high praise for his performance in the Bulldogs\u2019 thumping win in reserve grade last week. Yes, Sexton scored 18 points via nine goals, but the real star in the halves that day was Mitchell Woods. Toby Sexton is departing the Bulldogs at the end of the season. Credit: Getty Images That was conveniently ignored when trying to reinforce an agenda of creating tension around the non-selection of Sexton as starting halfback for the Bulldogs. The stats \u2013 which we accept are not always the true measure of a performance \u2013 were overwhelmingly in favour of Woods. The half had four try assists and scored one of his own in a dominant performance. Sexton had one try assist. This is not highlighted to criticise Sexton, who had an excellent game, though he simply wasn\u2019t as effective as Woods. Unfortunately, Sexton is being used as a tool by News Corp to try and create division within the Bulldogs ranks. If they fall anywhere short of the grand final, Sexton\u2019s non-selection will be tossed up as the reason. Gardiner\u2019s legal route over McKinnon furore\n\nOutgoing Knights boss Phil Gardiner is having a legal crack at the media who reported on a situation involving Alex McKinnon and the way he was treated by the Knights at a recent home game. Gardiner has fired off legal letters alleging he was defamed, following claims McKinnon had to pay his own way into the game against the Storm two weeks ago, on the same day a charity that assists those with disabilities was being promoted. You will remember McKinnon\u2019s life changed forever when he broke his neck during an on-field incident in a match against the Storm in 2014. The Knights are adamant McKinnon was offered tickets that day (they say he has a lifetime pass), and was aware of the charity involvement. Gardiner was so dismayed by the reports that he has now gone down the legal route. The sad thing is that McKinnon is involved. He has suffered enough and should always feel welcome at every opportunity. The Knights say he is always a priority for them. NRL is Live and Free on Channel 9 & 9Now",

Source: Getty / Anadolu / Getty Images He said civilian casualties and death in Gaza was \"completely unacceptable\" and \"completely indefensible\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Quite clearly, it is a breach of international law to stop food being delivered which was a decision that Israel made in March,\" he told the ABC's Insiders program on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not a lawyer, those things will play out their course, but I tell you what it's a breach of - it's a breach of decent humanity and of morality and everyone can see that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm a supporter of Israel and Israel's right to defend itself, but that boy isn't challenging Israel's right to existence, and nor are the many who continue to suffer from the unavailability of food and water.\"\n\n\n\nAlbanese said that he is a \"supporter of Israel\" and its right to \"defend itself\", saying that Hamas was holding not just Israelis hostage but also Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he said international law states innocent people should not be held responsible for the actions of Hamas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Israel as a democratic state has a responsibility to ensure that innocent lives are not lost, and we have seen too many Israeli and Palestinian lives lost.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia won't yet recognise a Palestinian state\n\nThe prime minister moved on to discuss how the war could come to an end, citing his support for a two-state solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about whether his support for a two-state solution extends to recognising a Palestinian state, Albanese said a decision would be made at an \"appropriate time\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we will do is we'll make a decision based upon the time. Is the time right now? Are we about to imminently do that? No, we are not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prime minister listed his concerns about recognition, questioning how it would reduce Hamas' involvement in a Palestinian state and how such a state could exist and not threaten Israel's sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We won't do any decision as a gesture. We will do it as a way forward if the circumstances are met,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, France announced it would formally recognise the state of Palestine at the UN General Assembly on September 21 , drawing criticism from the US and Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese said Australia is prepared to play a \"constructive role\" but has minimal influence as a \"middle power\" in global politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe flagged that the United States would have a \"critical role\" to play as it has been an intermediary during the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nAir drops of aid to resume\n\nInternational aid organisations say mass hunger has now arrived among Gaza's 2.2 million people, with stocks running out after Israel cut off all supplies to the territory in March, then reopened it in May but with different restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael said it resumed aid airdrops to Gaza on Saturday and was taking several other steps to ease the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave, amid mounting international pressure and warnings from relief agencies of starvation spreading there.\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military said \"humanitarian corridors\" would be established for the safe movement of United Nations convoys delivering aid to Gazans and that \"humanitarian pauses\" would be implemented in densely populated areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese described Israel's allowance of aid airdrops and convoys as a \"start\" but that the civilian casualties in Gaza are \"completely indefensible\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, it was reported 15 people, including a six-week-old baby, starved to death in 24 hours in Gaza, according to doctors, linking this to a wave of hunger that persisted for months.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional reporting by the Reuters News Agency.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow is starring in a new ad for Astronomer.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost a fortnight after the tech company's married CEO, Andy Byron, was caught on a Coldplay concert kiss cam with his arms around his HR executive Kristin Cabot, Paltrow has been hired as a \"temporary\" spokesperson for Astronomer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 52-year-old, who was married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin from 2003 until 2016, appeared in a short video on Astronomer's social media speaking about the company's strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer. Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days, and they wanted me to answer the most common one,\" she says in the ad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first question, \"OMG! What the actual f***?\", then appeared on the screen in writing.\n\n\n\nHowever, she dodged the question and plugged the company's products: \"We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next question to Astronomer was, \"How is your social media team holding ...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Paltrow moved on before the whole question could be asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will now be returning to what we do best, which is delivering game-changing results for our customers. Thank you for your interest in Astronomer,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe video was captioned: \"Thank you for your interest in Astronomer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media users chimed in after the video was released, with tech journalist Neville Lahiru saying: \"Getting Chris Martin's ex-wife was a genius move lol.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPR and communications consultant Ronke Lawal lauded the move as an \"engaging way to handle a PR crisis\" and \"socially relevant without being too corny and cringe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother user, Matt Brian, commented: \"Marketing genius. Owning the Coldplay kiss cam video *and* hiring Chris Martin\u2019s ex-wife? Splendid.\"\n\n\n\nAt Coldplay's 15 July concert near Boston, a cameraman panned across the crowd and showed Byron and Cabot in an embrace.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a video shared to TikTok, as the couple frantically tried to dodge the camera, frontman Martin could be heard saying: \"Oh, look at these two. All right, c'mon, you're okay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Byron and Cabot have since resigned from the company.\n\n\n\n",

I started to like be a bit scared, a bit concerned, like oh.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's returned every six months since to monitor more closely how the condition is progressing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 300,000 people in Australia live with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C - often without any warning signs of liver damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Gregory Dore of the Kirby Institute says that silent progression is exactly why routine testing matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it doesn't cause symptoms in the initial years, and sometimes even in the initial decades of infection, that's why it can be termed the silent killer because people can have the infection and it can be causing damage to the liver, but they're completely unaware of that, so that's why it's really crucial that we get the message out about who should be screened and tested.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis Australia CEO Lucy Clynes says understanding who's most at risk is also a crucial part of that process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that half that population are either undiagnosed, that means they don't know they are living with hepatitis or they are not connected to the care or the treatment that they need. Hepatitis is Australia's leading cause of cancer death - we have to get people connected to care and support.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIts new report poses the question - if 100 people were living with viral hepatitis, who would they be?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found 69 would be living with Hepatitis B and almost a quarter with Hepatitis C.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome can live with multiple forms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conditions differ as do their treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis C is curable, but has no vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis B has a vaccine and treatments, but no cure.\n\n\n\n\n\nEliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat is the major goal, with almost 1,000 deaths in Australia recorded each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government is aiming to get there by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Hepatitis Australia wants more action, warning the current rate of progress won't reach that target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know migrant communities are disproportionately impacted by viral hepatitis - particularly Hepatitis B. That means we have to be providing information in a range of community languages and in ways that are culturally sensitive to the needs of migrant populations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe snapshot shows 70 per cent of people affected by Hepatitis B would be born overseas, including higher rates from countries in south east Asia, where mother-to-child transmission is more common.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile more than half - 56 per cent - speak a language other than English at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nMei Mak has the experienced the stigma that can come with a diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she's urging others not to let that stop them looking out for their health.\n\n\n\n",

There's the beautiful day that we were waiting for this first six months of his life where he could hear us for the first time. That was unbelievable. We were waiting, so excited for this day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was 12 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nRafael, now 13, was diagnosed with profound hearing loss soon after birth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so too, were his younger brothers, 10-year-old Gabriel and six-year-old Luca.\n\n\n\nThe Sydney-based siblings all had the device implanted around the age of six months but it was just the beginning of their journey towards hearing and speaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a cochlear implant can be life-changing, the technology alone is not enough, says Dr Aleisha Davis, CEO of the Shepherd Centre, a not-for-profit that helps children with hearing loss learn to listen and speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's such a misconception that hearing aids or cochlear implants help a child hear, but they don't. They provide access and the technology helps them hear sound, but brains aren't wired to understand sound at such early ages. So we provide the therapy that enables the children to understand what those signals are and to learn to use them in their everyday environments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brothers also took part in the Shepherd Centre's early intervention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe children are now thriving, says their mother Renata, who migrated to Australia from Brazil 17 years ago.\n\n\n\nMusic is a big part of the family's cultural identity and the two eldest boys are members of their school band.\n\n\n\n\"The program here was essential for them to thrive. You come here for maybe a day in the week, but it's all about the work that you put in every single day, exposing them to language, to sounds and music. They're doing quite well at school. They are very social little people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a decade ago that prominent Japanese hearing health specialist Doctor Akira Takagi first learnt about the work at the Shepherd Centre.\n\n\n\nHe says in Japan, children diagnosed with hearing loss who wish to receive a cochlear implant don't typically have the surgery until the age of one or two.\n\n\n\nIn Australia, it's around six months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The sooner the surgery the better the outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Doctor Takagi adds there's a lack of services in Japan to teach children how to use the devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he was 'amazed' by the program offered by the Shepherd Centre.\n\n\n\n\"This is the system I am trying to create in Japan in collaboration with the Shepherd centre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis month that became a reality with the launch of an early intervention pilot program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAleisha Davis says the partnership has been a decade in the making. \"I am thrilled that it's happening and that we can help many more children than those locally here in Australia. It really will change the way that children grow up learning to listen with cochlear implants in Japan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all children born with hearing impairment use a cochlear implant.\n\n\n\nSome families opt for Auslan, while others are bilingual using both sign-language and spoken language.\n\n\n\n\n\nShirley Liu, the CEO of Deaf Australia - the main association representing deaf people in Australia - says there is a diversity of experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to SBS in Auslan, which we've translated to spoken language, she emphasises the need for access to sign language from birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not an either/or, black or white, system that you can either have access to sound or access to Auslan and they can be used in conjunction with each other. Our position is that Auslan is essential and it's a valuable and vital language for deaf children to have access to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 90 per cent of deaf children are born to hearing parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means many families are initially unfamiliar with deafness.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was the case for Liz Speilman, whose two-and-half-year-old son, Louis was diagnosed with hearing loss shortly after birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We didn't know anything about hearing loss. We don't have anyone that's deaf in our family. So it was a new world to us as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLouis, who has been fitted with a cochlear implant, has been taking part in therapy sessions at Shepherd Centre every week for the past two years.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australia's Kaden Groves has completed his set of grand tour stage wins after traversing the slippery roads to triumph on the penultimate day of the Tour de France.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian sprinter is normally renowned for fast finishes, but excelled in the tough and wet slog over the hills to claim an emotional victory from the 13-man breakaway.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alpecin-Deceuninck rider surged ahead 16 kilometres from home and held on for his first Tour stage win and 10th at major races. The 26-year-old from the Sunshine Coast has claimed two at the Giro d'Italia and seven at the Spanish Vuelta.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe finished 54 seconds ahead of Frank van den Broek and 59 clear of Pascal Eenkhoorn, bursting into tears as he crossed the finish line in Pontarlier.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroves' first career Tour stage win was a third of this race for his Alpecin-Deceuninck team but the first since stage two, with their previous two winners, Jasper Philipsen and Mathieu van der Poel, since lost to injury and illness.\n\n\n\n\"Today we weren't sure whether to go for the stage or wait for tomorrow but when the rain falls I have a super feeling normally in the cold weather,\" an emotional Groves said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's so much pressure at the Tour, and having won in the Giro, having won in the Vuelta, all I ever get asked is am I good enough to win in the Tour? And now I show them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's my first time winning, so it's pretty incredible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the stage, another Australian, Harrison Sweeny, had made his mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the front group tackled the 3.6km C\u00f4te de Th\u00e9sy, Frenchman Jordan Jegat launched a solo attack, but he was then overtaken by Sweeny.\n\n\n\nKaden Groves celebrates on the podium after winning a Tour de France stage for the first time. Source: AP / Mosa'ab Elshamy As rain fell heavily again after 40km, Sweeny opened up a 50-second lead, only to be quickly reeled in.\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the Australian cameos, Poga\u010dar kept things safe to maintain his healthy lead over arch-rival Vingegard and set the stage for a triumphant finale into Paris on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Slovenian ace has a 4 minutes 24 seconds advantage over two-time Tour winner Vingegaard with Germany's Florian Lipowitz 11:03 behind Poga\u010dar in third overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarring a dramatic misadventure, Poga\u010dar should complete the job on Sunday (local time) and move level with British rider Chris Froome on four Tour titles.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory would also give Poga\u010dar a fifth Grand Tour after winning the Giro d'Italia in dominant fashion last year.\n\n\n\nHowever, Sunday's final stage is not a processional one, as is usually the case, and could potentially prove troublesome toward the end with three consecutive climbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday's 184.2km route from Nantua through eastern France featured three small climbs and a moderately difficult one up C\u00f4te de Th\u00e9sy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wet roads were treacherous at high speeds, with France's Romain Gr\u00e9goire and Spaniard Iv\u00e1n Romeo both crashing as they attempted to navigate tight turns. Both were able to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final stage is a 132.3km ride from Mantes-la-Jolie to Paris, where the peloton will cycle up the famous Butte Montmartre three times before the final laps on the Champs-Elysees.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

Source: SBS News / Christopher Tan Wright, who is on income support, talks through the layout of her single-cab ute, with calm resolve: she's already planned how to convert it into a sleeping space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I probably have to get a smaller bed than this \u2026 so I can fit a wardrobe on the side \u2026 and that's all I would really need,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I always aim for minimalist living but maximalist style, and the past year and a half has really challenged me to do that.\"\n\n\n\nI can't have my daughter with me in that space.

It's one of the steepest increases for a capital city in the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite recent and forecasted interest rate cuts, as well as expanded government first home buying schemes, affordability in Perth is continuing to deteriorate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it is renters who are feeling the sharpest edge.\n\n\n\nPerth recorded the steepest rise in advertised weekly rents nationwide between 2019 and 2024, outpacing all other capital cities. Source: SBS News The median advertised rent in Perth has climbed from $350 a week in 2019 to $650 by the end of 2024 \u2014 an 86 per cent spike that makes it the least affordable capital city for renters in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the Northern Territory, WA is one of the two remaining jurisdictions that still allow \"no-grounds\" evictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis describes a scenario in which landlords can evict tenants without providing a reason, as long as they give 30 days' notice at the end of a fixed-term lease or 60 days during a periodic lease. They can issue an eviction notice even if the tenant hasn't done anything wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are seven other legal grounds for eviction, including property sales, hardship and tenant breaches.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lack of protection from no-fault termination leaves renters like Wright vulnerable.\n\n\n\nGrowing risk of homelessness\n\nAccording to the most recent Census, 9,729 people were experiencing homelessness in WA in 2021 \u2014 a 114 per cent increase from the previous Census. That includes 2,315 people who reported sleeping rough.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last financial year, Shelter WA says nearly 25,000 people sought help from specialist homelessness services in WA, representing an 18 per cent jump over the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing advocate Jordan van den Lamb says the crisis is no longer isolated to the most vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing 10,000 people experience homelessness each month,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most people have felt this pressure in the last three years. Renters are choosing between their rent and medication, groceries, bills.\"\n\n\n\nHousing advocate Jordan van den Lamb says soaring rents and weak protections are pushing more Western Australians to the brink. \"We can't rely on a market solution to fix a market failure,\" he says. Source: SBS News / Christopher Tan Shelter WA estimates a person earning $70,000 a year would now spend 58 per cent of their income on rent alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am pretty sure constantly moving out \u2026 unless you want to \u2026 is not what the great Australian dream is for housing,\" Wright says.\n\n\n\nThe power imbalance\n\nTenants are increasingly afraid to speak up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice Pennycott, principal tenancy lawyer at Circle Green Community Legal, says she sees this fear every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People come to us for advice on repairs, but then they hesitate \u2014 worried that if they complain, their lease won't be renewed,\" Pennycott says.\n\n\n\nThere's no way to challenge a no-grounds eviction. Unless the notice itself is invalid \u2014 the reason doesn't matter.\n\nVictoria and NSW have scrapped no-fault evictions. NSW introduced reforms in May, allowing landlords to terminate leases only for specific reasons, such as selling the property, renovating, or moving in themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates say the WA government is reluctant to act, fearing landlords may exit the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Pennycott says that's not a justification for inaction.\n\n\n\nAlice Pennycott from Circle Green Community Legal is calling for urgent reforms to end no-grounds evictions and improve protections for people at risk of losing their homes. Source: SBS News / Christopher Tan \"We are not saying landlords shouldn't be allowed to evict people,\" Pennycott says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are saying we just want a reason and we are supporting introducing more reasons into the legislation.\"\n\n\n\nA broken market\n\nEven with 20,500 homes completed in 2024 \u2014 the most in seven years \u2014 WA still fell short of its National Housing Accord target of 25,000 dwellings.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince March 2023, only 694 new rental dwellings have been added in Perth, which represents a growth of just 0.4 per cent. Over the same period, the population has surged by 119,000, leaving a rental shortfall of 7,700 homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nVacancy rates have ticked slightly above 2 per cent but remain well below healthy levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rent is going up five times faster than wages,\" van den Lamb says. \"We can't rely on a market solution to fix a market failure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with 3,300 social homes delivered and 5,800 more promised by the WA government, waitlists continue to grow.\n\n\n\nDemand for social housing in WA has surged, with the waiting list ballooning and urgent applications rising sharply over the past six years. Source: SBS News More than 21,000 people are now waiting for public housing. The average wait time is 151 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong priority applicants, including people escaping domestic violence or homelessness, demand has jumped 330 per cent in six years.\n\n\n\n'You didn't choose that life'\n\nFor many Western Australians, financial stress is only the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People used to get a termination notice and say, 'Well, I'll just find another rental.' Now they're saying, 'Where am I going to go?'\" Pennycott says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing legal support is becoming more complex, she says.\n\n\n\nPeople are looking for help more than ever because they have fewer alternatives. We hear from people every day who don't know where they'll sleep next week.\n\nThe cumulative toll on renters like Wright is immense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you can't have your children with you, or you're both living in a car and you didn't choose that life, that's not just hard, it's dehumanising,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How is it that we live in such a beautiful and privileged society, and there are so many people without somewhere to live?\"\n\n\n\nSystemic change needed\n\nThe latest BCEC report titled 'A long way from home' outlines a comprehensive plan to tackle WA's housing crisis, and calls for urgent investment in both rental and public housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-term recommendations include expanding the Commonwealth Rent Assistance scheme and making the WA Rent Relief Program permanent. The program has already helped over 2,700 renters remain in their homes.\n\n\n\nAt Circle Green Community Legal, frontline staff take calls from renters facing mounting housing stress. Many are seeking urgent advice after receiving eviction notices or struggling with unaffordable rent hikes. Source: SBS News / Christopher Tan The report also calls for more crisis and transitional accommodation, particularly for women and families escaping domestic violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the medium term, it recommends fast-tracking housing completions, scaling up social and affordable housing using the state's investment fund, and targeting new developments at first-home buyers and key workers, such as childcare educators, retail and hospitality workers, health support workers, and general administrative services.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also calls for incentives for build-to-rent developments and enforceable standards for rental properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong its long-term recommendations, the report urges the WA government to commit to delivering 24,000 new homes each year \u2014 including a minimum of 1,200 new or repurposed social dwellings \u2014 and to replace stamp duty with a more efficient system to support household mobility.\n\n\n\nSmall steps, but a long way to go\n\nIn 2024, the WA government updated its Residential Tenancies Act, with the first tranche of changes allowing pets and minor modifications in most rentals and limiting rent increases to once every 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reforms were introduced in addition to the ban on rent bidding and retaliatory actions from landlords brought in earlier that year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there's still no cap on rental increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, a state government spokesperson declined to say whether it would abolish \"no grounds\" evictions entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Recommendations for a second phase of reforms are expected to be finalised for consideration later this year,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Stage two will consider a range of further measures to protect renters, including setting minimum standards, the collection of bonds, rents and other charges, and clear definitions of boarding and lodging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Consultation with stakeholders will guide the second phase of these reforms.\"\n\n\n\nSeen through her office window, tenancy lawyer Alice Pennycott works to support renters navigating an increasingly hostile housing market. She says more and more people are reaching out with nowhere else to turn. Source: SBS News / Christopher Tan But advocates say these measures barely scratch the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't address the heart of the problem: renters being protected from being thrown out into the street into homelessness,\" Pennycott says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWA court data shows more than 1,500 eviction applications have been filed annually in the last four years, not including informal or unchallenged cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nBCEC figures also reveal that nearly two-thirds of single women renters in WA aged 55 and over are living in poverty, with half in the \"severe poverty\" category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a growing awareness now. Everyone knows someone who's been impacted \u2014 whether it's rent hikes, eviction, or just the stress of trying to find a place to live,\" Pennycott says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[But] we've been lobbying for change since 2019.\"\n\n\n\nSitting beneath the trees by the Swan River, Elizabeth Wright reflects on the emotional toll of housing insecurity. With support systems stretched and options running out, she says no-one should be forced to raise a child from the back of a car in a country as wealthy as Australia. Source: SBS News / Christopher Tan For Wright, the crisis isn't just about statistics \u2014 it's about recognising the humanity of renters.\n\n\n\nWe treat housing as a commodity, but it's a basic human right.\n\nWright's wish is singular: All she wants, she says, is a place to call home again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just want to give my daughter a secure place to grow up.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing humour to challenge perceptions of what it is like to live with a disability - it's an approach writer and performer Emily Dash uses in her storytelling, in theatre and film, to dismantle stigma and stereotypes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA full-time wheelchair user, she lives with cerebral palsy - a disability that affects movement and posture.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says her art takes inspiration from real life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My mission when it comes to artistic works is to reveal truth about me and my life - and my lived experience - in the way that serves not only me, but also inspires other people to reveal something about theirs. That would be my mission and to break down attitudinal barriers so that disability will just be front and centre in society and not in the margins.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you're about to hear is how that came together in her short film 'Groundhog Night'.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt explores the family dynamics between carer Gary, his disabled daughter Jess, played by Emily Dash, and the in-laws who visit unexpectedly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this scene, Gary is kissing his date goodnight outside the door of his home when he is interrupted by daughter Jess.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for Emily, no topics are off the table - including relationships, as heard on-stage at this year's Adelaide Fringe Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmily is among disability advocates featured at this year's Disability Pride Sydney festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganiser Hannah Solomons says the event is being held for the fourth year, and it centres disability inclusion and accessibility, with sign language support, audio description and mobility access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're making some progress, but we still need desperately need it (a Disability Pride festival). The amount of hate we're getting on our Facebook page is proof of that. The discussions around the NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme). There is still this idea that we're not a valuable part of society and we should just go away. So if you are shamed and rejected, the best antidote to that is to find your tribe and get together and celebrate yourself in public. We're taking up the space and demanding to be included.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe festival is part of a broader global movement of Disability Pride first marked in an event 35 years ago in the United States city of Boston, to mark the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, an estimated 1 billion people have a disability - or 15 per cent of the total population.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia that number is 5.5 million people - more than 20 per cent of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe census shows the number of people with a disability is growing across all age groups below the age of 70 - at that point the number stabilises.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also shows that disability discrimination affects one in 10, with that number increasing to 1 in 5 for those with a more severe disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt affects all arenas in society: the workplace, hospitality venues and interactions with strangers in the street.\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Solomons says despite the size of the disability community, the diversity of it is poorly understood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The responsibility is on all of us to not have a lazy brain. Because if there is a person that is different to us and we don't have experience of our lives, our brain will take the easy way out; and try to box them - and give them a two-dimensional picture in our heads. And that leads to horrible behaviour like you're lying if you have invisible disability; or you're worthless if you have a visible disability; or both. And none of that is okay. I don't know why our society is still so ableist (discrimination against people with a disability). But it is. I could cite statistics that could make your hair curl. The stigma is still there. We're not accepting it. We're not okay with that any more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDancing her way on stage and suspended in the air by hanging on a pole with one arm is Deb Roach.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three-time world pole dancing champion has performed at multiple editions of the Disability Pride Sydney festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn without most of her left arm, Deb has always cultivated a positive mindset, but it hasn't been without it challenges - including bullying in her younger years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDance and DJ-ing proved to be important outlets for self-expression, but it was her introduction to pole dancing that really solidified her self-confidence as an artist and advocate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt all started 18 years ago, when she watched a performance at a gothic carnival-themed event - and was absolutely mesmerised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And these two pole dancers - they were Missy and Suzie Q - did a doubles routine where they were marionette puppets who broke free from the puppet master's strings. And they I had never seen pole in a circus context and the storytelling, the theatre, the athleticism. My mind was absolutely blown. I was backstage with those girls and I said: 'You are amazing with your two arms and your poledancing. That was mindblowing. I wish I could do what you do.' And their response to that was: 'Have you tried?' And I am a little bit like Marty McFly from (the film) 'Back to the Future' in the sense that if I am challenged I show up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years later she won her first pole champion title, going on to win two more.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow as a pole dance studio owner, she guides others in redefining the idea of what is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has also been involved in the movement to increase the representation of Australians with disability in advertising from less than 1 per cent - and towards population parity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLed by the Dylan Alcott Foundation, the Shift 20 campaign is already having an impact, with more and more events that are access-first and access-forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeb Roach credits events like the Disability Pride Festival with building a strong sense of community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's electric - I love it! I really struggled growing up. I am a feisty individual and I didn't claim the disability - my label as a person with a disability - until I was until I was well into my late twenties. I refused to interact with it. You know, I just wanted to be a person who was a good athlete - and a good human being. But it was the disability pride movement that really helped me lean into the belonging and that sense of healing that I didn't even know that I needed in the community connection - in the space and in that room - and in that togetherness.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso featured at this year's festival is songwriter and performer Dean Nash.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese days he sings and speaks frankly about living with cerebral palsy, but it wasn't always that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the way that I walk is difficult. And I don't have a lot of function of my left arm and my left hand. I can't move my fingers all that independently. But I have learnt to play the piano - in my opinion, quite well - with the use of just six fingers. When I first started playing, the general feedback would be: 'oh, you don't play like everybody else does'. But once I got good at what I was doing, the narrative shifted to: 'oh, nobody plays that like you do'. And so to me that is a real highlight that a different approach to something doesn't necessarily mean a lesser one. It simply means a different one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he has found the arts to be a powerful medium to start conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Art has a tendency to be the cornerstone of changing hearts and minds. I think cultural change really starts with the stuff that we're putting out in our media. We are the largest minority group in the world because anybody can join this group at any time. And I think that is a really confronting thought for a lot of people. I have a joke in my show where I say there are only two kinds of people in the world: there are disabled people and pre-disabled people. And the disabled audience members cackle at that; and the rest of the audience has a slow intake of breath.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEmily Dash says she hopes her advocacy makes the path easier for others, moving disability from the shadows to centre stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am grateful for all the people that have not only come before me but will come after me to get this mission off the ground. The latest statistics show that only four per cent of main characters onscreen have disability in drama. So there is a really long way to go yet. And even when there is representation, it is important to make sure that that representation is done authentically putting people's lived experience at the centre.\"\n\n\n\n",

I can't believe it,\" Arensman said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Already one stage on the Tour was unbelievable, from a breakaway, but now from the GC (general classification) group, against the strongest riders in the world, it feels like I'm dreaming.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSlovenian Poga\u010dar retained the overall leader's yellow jersey and leads Vingegaard by 4:24 going into the final two stages and is widely expected to win a fourth title if he avoids a major incident.\n\n\n\nGerman Florian Lipowitz took fourth place on the shortened stage to cement his third place overall, stretching his advantage over fourth-placed Oscar Onley of Britain by 41 seconds to 1:03.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would have taken a colossal coup from Vingegaard to topple Poga\u010dar on the final mountain test in the Alps, but the Visma-Lease a Bike rider only tried within the last 100 metres to take two seconds off of the Slovenian's lead, with Poga\u010dar emerging as the puppet master of the peloton.\n\n\n\n\n\nA leading trio featuring France's Lenny Martinez and Valentin Paret Peintre as well as former Tour runner-up Primoz Roglic, reached the Col du Pre with a small gap of a chasing group after a brutal 12.2-km ascent at 7.7 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peloton, controlled by Poga\u010dar's UAE Emirates-XRG, trailed by less than a minute.\n\n\n\nWith two kilometres left in the climb up to the Cormet de Roselend (5.9km at 6.9 per cent), Paret Peintre and Roglic shook off Martinez, but only briefly as the Bahrain-Victorious rider clawed his way back.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoglic was then swallowed two kilometres before the final climb and spat out immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustrian Felix Gall, gunning for a top five finish in Paris, accelerated 14.5km from the finish with Arensman, Poga\u010dar and Vingegaard reacting.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar made his own move 14km from the top with Vingegaard and Arensman the only riders able to get into his slipstream.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar eventually let Arensman go and seemed content with setting a decent tempo to keep the Dutchman within reach, but the Slovenian eventually did not make the effort to go for a fifth stage win this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Ben O'Connor, who brilliantly won Thursday's 18th stage, was placed 12th, ensuring he kept his overall 10th position in the GC. South Australian Callum Scotson (Decathlon Ag2r La Mondiale) was placed 24th.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Triple J's Saturday debut of its Hottest 100 of Australian songs has prompted many to reflect on the state of the local music industry \u2014 and the sobering reality that perhaps the biggest hurdle is cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn April report from Creative Australia found 62 per cent of Australians say music is really important to them \u2014 but cost is the main barrier to attending live shows.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile 66 per cent said they want to hear more local music, many still prioritise saving up their dollars to see international acts \u2014 simply because they\u2019re rarer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFBi Radio\u2019s Tyson Koh says people tightening their hip pockets are having a direct flow-on effect on the industry, especially community radio, which has long been considered a cornerstone of the Australian music scene.\n\n\n\n\n\nFBi Radio \u2014 where Koh is managing director \u2014 has been an institution in the inner-Sydney suburb of Redfern since 2003, bolstered mostly by community memberships.\n\n\n\nBut in June, it had to cut half its permanent staff after entering a period of \"extreme financial distress\". It still isn't out of the woods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We found that in this brave new world of digital streaming and social media, a few people had taken our service for granted,\" Koh said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were still listening to the station \u2014 but because they already had several other subscription-based services to keep up with, we'd gotten lost in the mix.\"\n\n\n\nTyson Koh says the cost of living crisis and growth of algorithmic music streaming is affecting community radio stations such as FBi, which could close its doors if not enough funding is secured. Source: Supplied / John Feder As cost-of-living pressures linger, Koh says discretionary spending \u2014 such as going to live gigs or subscribing to community radio stations \u2014 is becoming harder to justify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We really need our listeners to show up for us if we are to survive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we have to decide as a society whether music is important \u2026 if we can agree on that, then the question comes down to support and participation.\"\n\n\n\nLess disposable income, fewer ticket sales\n\nJoe Draffen, bassist for Melbourne band Floodlights, says the rising cost of living is also affecting artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The current economic climate has made it harder to sell tickets, as many people just don\u2019t have as much disposable income right now due to the rising cost of living,\" Draffen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On top of that, our own expenses have gone up, which meant ticket prices had to increase too.\"\n\n\n\nMelbourne-based band Floodlights say the cost of living crisis has put pressure on musicians, leading to slower ticket sales and higher touring costs. Source: Supplied / Matt Shaw \"Touring\u2019s gotten a lot more expensive \u2014 flights, accommodation, gear hire, crew \u2014 it all adds up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band has also been impacted by the closure of several music festivals across the country, which would typically bring more exposure and broaden their fan base.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 25 music festivals across Australia have been cancelled since 2022, according to data from the Australian Festival Association.\n\n\n\nCommunity-led efforts still not enough\n\nCaitlin Welsh and Joe Hardy run SydneyMusic.net, a manually curated gig guide born from the loss of local music press and the lingering effects of Sydney\u2019s lockout laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guide briefly shut down in June due to a lack of funds, before a flurry of one-off donations and sponsorships allowed Welsh and Hardy to keep going \u2014 for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People hugely underestimate the amount of time and human labour it takes to manually research and compile the gig guide, as well as put together playlists and post daily lists to socials,\" Welsh told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s made by a small team of humans \u2014 including musicians and creatives who work with us as researchers \u2014 who need to be compensated for the amount of labour we\u2019re all doing in order to continue living in one of the most expensive cities in the world.\"\n\n\n\nCaitlin Welsh and Joe Hardy founded gig guide SydneyMusic.net after frustrations with the diminishing Sydney music scene. But the cost of living is making it difficult for them to continue operating. Source: Supplied / Caitlin Welsh But live music spaces are becoming increasingly rare as venues face even more pressure to keep the doors open.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia Wallis is a Brisbane-based musician and head of youth-focused record label Starving Kids, which runs a dedicated 150-capacity all-ages venue in Brisbane, serving musicians who are often booking their first show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The gap between local acts and established acts seems to be getting wider,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Brisbane is home to some great large-scale venues, but with more and more small venues closing, there are noticeably less opportunities for artists to cut their teeth.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The $50,000 reason some Australian music festivals are calling it quits\n\nMore than 1,300 live music venues and stages across Australia have been lost since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a 2023 report from music rights management organisation APRA AMCOS.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelsh added: \"Venues are being bled by insurance premiums and rent and the alcohol excise, and they can\u2019t afford to run all-ages shows because they rely on bar sales to support putting on music at all, and punters can\u2019t afford to buy as many drinks as they used to because their rent is too damn high.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The narrowing of music participation to people who can afford to treat it as a hobby, or who are forced to accept poverty to keep doing it, is just as creatively flattening as the algorithm.\"\n\n\n\nAlgorithms placing pressure on industry\n\nAt the same time, streaming platforms such as Spotify are continuing to grow, with over nine million users in Australia. Date from market research firm Roy Morgan found Spotify had doubled its Australian user base between 2017 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2017, the platform has moved towards algorithmically creating personalised music recommendations, informed by a user's listening history and preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoh says this means that people are more likely to value platforms like these instead of community radio, which was traditionally a hub for music discoverability.\n\n\n\n\"People lead such busy lives, so the amount of time that people can devote to going on their own musical journey and discovering new artists is getting more and more limited,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoh says this convenience is creating a \"giant homogenous culture\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One thing that social media and algorithms can't replace is the experience and joy of seeing a band. That's often where artists find their audiences and the people who they can take on the journey with them throughout their careers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite coming off their largest Australian tour so far, Floodlights say it\u2019s become harder to be discovered organically \u2014 even in the midst of a breakout moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s so much music coming out every day, and unless you\u2019re backed by major playlists or algorithms, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the noise,\" Draffen said.\n\n\n\nShould Triple J be doing more?\n\nIn the face of so many obstacles, musicians such as Ben Lee \u2014 who is expected to chart in Saturday's countdown for his hits Cigarettes Will Kill You and Catch My Disease \u2014 have called for the ABC's Triple J to do more to support Australian music, including restricting all Hottest 100 countdowns to only spotlight Australian songs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At a time when there are so many platforms for international music discovery, I just don't see the logic in a taxpayer-funded station using their platform to promote international acts, many on major labels,\" Lee told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it was being run like a \"commercial station that's constantly bending over backwards to increase listenership\", primarily through bigger international artists. Lee added that it should move to play only Australian music across the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They could single-handedly lead the way to revitalising the Australian music industry if they wanted to. But it would mean stopping thinking of themselves as a commercial radio station, but rather as a mission-driven government utility,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe station has a mandated quota of 40 per cent for Australian music, but typically plays closer to the 50 per cent mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Lee made similar remarks on both social media and to The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n\n\n\n\nHead of Triple J Lachlan Macara told the Herald seeing local artists next to international names was what made the Hottest 100 \" so special\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the program \"would love to see even more people and platforms supporting and prioritising Australian artists\".\n\n\n\nAustralian musician Ben Lee has called for Triple J to do more to support Australian music. Source: Getty / Martin Philbey But members of the industry are still conflicted over the best path forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Floodlights recently played their biggest headline shows across the country, Draffen said it\u2019s still difficult to cut through without support from Triple J.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019ve really had to double down on staying connected with our audience and finding new ways to reach people but it's hard as Triple J doesn\u2019t really play us, which obviously makes it tougher to reach a wider audience in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWallis said that while artists at her record label have seen \"great support\" from Triple J Unearthed, which features unsigned local acts, she wanted to see more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I strongly believe Triple J should be focusing more on a diverse range of homegrown acts, rather than commercial, international acts that already have a platform.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWelsh agrees the Hottest 100 should be all-Australian each year, but stopped short of supporting that across the board. \"Nobody does more for Australian music than Triple J,\" she said. \"The ones who are letting down Australian music are the commercial stations \u2026 There has been zero accountability for commercial radio formats to meet their local music quotas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKoh agreed: \"We know that we're doing our bit, and I think Triple J does as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFBi Radio also operates under a 50 per cent Australian music mandate, with half of that coming from Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's important to see Australian music in a global context and that local artists just don't exist in a silo.\"\n\n\n\n",

She says she's constantly exhausted.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn weekdays, her routine starts at 5.30am so she can ready herself for work and drop her kids off at childcare.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe describes the process as \"rinse and repeat\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are regimented in our routine and if anything upsets the order of things [such as someone falling sick] everything gets a lot harder,\" she says.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The male breadwinner is gone. Why working from home is necessary for modern families\n\nDadic's husband does childcare pick-ups in the evenings, but then there's dinner to prepare, bathtime and the battle to put her children to bed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter is dreadful, she says, because the kids pick up various bugs from childcare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are pretty socially isolated. Evening plans feel impossible, and we are usually too tired anyway, so they happen rarely.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, Dadic's situation is not unique.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost women now work and continue doing so even after having children.\n\n\n\nModern working conditions due for an update?\n\nNext year will mark 100 years since US carmaker Henry Ford pioneered a five-day work week for employees in his factories, which was a reduction from the six days generally worked.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwinburne University associate professor of management John Hopkins believes modern working conditions are again due for an update, including the possibility of working fewer hours.\n\n\n\nHenry Ford pioneered the five-day work week in his US factories almost 100 years ago. Source: Getty / PhotoQuest While the concept of a four-day work week has been discussed for more than 50 years, in the past decade, there has been a noticeable uptick in demand for more flexible work arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\nHopkins says that over the past century, new technologies such as the internet have sped up the rate at which people can work, but this hasn't necessarily freed up time for workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's actually worked the opposite. They are just required to do more work in the same amount of time,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHopkins says technology has even led to people working longer hours because it allows them to check emails or be available after work.\n\n\n\nWe've had this intensification of work over the last 100 years where we're doing a lot more work in those eight hours per day than we were ever doing before ... and our brains are becoming overloaded.\n\n\"We need more time to rest [and] recover.\"\n\n\n\nThe benefits of working less\n\nJapan, which is struggling with record-low birth rates, is shortening working hours as a way of encouraging parenthood.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government introduced a flexible work system that allows its employees to take three days off per week while maintaining the same total working hours over a four-week period.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, a spokesperson says the program allows employees to balance work and childcare responsibilities, and also helps those without children care for family members or pursue personal development.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn additional program specifically for parents of young children allows them to shorten their working hours by up to two hours per day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These hours do not need to be made up at a later date,\" the spokesperson says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHopkins says his research has found significant benefits to allowing workers to reduce their work hours \u2014 with no drop in salary \u2014 including a reduction in sick days, staff turnover, burnout and work-related stress.\n\n\n\nJapan has announced measures to ease the pressures of working life as it attempts to improve its low birth rate. Source: Getty / Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg As part of Hopkins' recent research project in Australia, 10 senior managers were interviewed about their experiences with introducing the four-day work week.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preview report released in 2023 showed that 70 per cent of employers observed increased productivity, while the other 30 per cent reported no change. None reported a drop.\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive results included reduced sick days and better ability to compete for talent and retain staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers found they had time to complete life admin tasks, take weekends away (including visiting family) and invest in self-care activities, such as exercise, massages and doctor visits. They also had more time to participate in hobbies.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The harsh reality of trying to be a mum and work in law\n\nThis week, a paper published in the scientific journal Nature Human Behaviour also reported that employees who trialled a four-day work week were less likely to suffer burnout, had a higher rate of job satisfaction, and better mental and physical health.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2,800 employees across 141 organisations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, Ireland and the US were surveyed. Ahead of the six-month trial, low-value activities such as \"unnecessary meetings\" were eliminated to prepare people for working reduced hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four-day work week is just one of several flexible work arrangements that are becoming increasingly popular, including hybrid work, remote work, unlimited leave, gender-neutral parental leave and flexible public holidays.\n\n\n\n'You need time to rest and recover'\n\nHopkins says one of the reasons Henry Ford dropped the number of work days from six to five was because he realised productivity didn't drop.\n\n\n\nTo perform at your best, to be the most productive, most efficient, you need time to rest and you need time to recover.\n\nHopkins points to AFL players as an example, noting they only play games once a week for six months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they were to play twice a week or three times a week, what would happen? They'd start to get more injuries, their performance would drop off.\"\n\n\n\nJust as athletes can get physical injuries if they push themselves too hard, other workers are susceptible to burnout. Source: Getty / Morgan Hancock He says some of the people interviewed for the four-day week survey said they no longer experienced the \"Sunday scaries\" before the start of the working week, when they would usually feel scared or apprehensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also gave people more time to reflect on their work, Hopkins says, and identify ways of improving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You never have a good idea when you're working, you have a good idea when you're in the shower or when you're taking the dog for a walk, because your brain is thinking about different things and allows you to be creative,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it is about striking that right balance between work and rest and recovery to optimise performance.\"\n\n\n\nYoung and middle-aged workers are feeling exhausted\n\nHopkins believes that work hours will be reassessed, partly because workers are feeling burnt out.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 Melbourne University study on the State of the Future of Work found that 33 per cent of young and middle-aged workers reported difficulty concentrating at work because of their responsibilities outside of work. This compares to just 11 per cent of mature workers (aged 55 years or older).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study looked at data from 1,400 Australian workers and found prime-aged workers (between 18 and 54 years old) were also twice as likely to feel like they didn't have enough time to do everything they needed to do compared to older workers.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Feeling depleted by work? This is how Melanie beat burnout without quitting her job\n\nMore than half of the workers without access to flexible work surveyed reported feeling exhausted (55 per cent) compared to 45 workers who had access to flexible conditions. They also felt less motivated while at work.\n\n\n\nUnions push for four-day work week\n\nThis week, both the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) issued statements calling for a shorter working week to be introduced, ahead of the federal government's productivity roundtable next month.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Murphy, national secretary of the AMWU, says gains from improved productivity over the past decade have gone to bosses and not to workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The best and most logical way to fairly share the gains of productivity is for workers to not have to work as many hours, and to move to a shorter working week,\" he says.\n\n\n\nProductivity cannot be at the expense of the wellbeing of workers.\n\nThe most recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows labour productivity fell by 1 per cent in the year to March, even though the number of hours worked rose by 2.3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Productivity Commission bulletin in June noted productivity growth over the past decade had stagnated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the absence of a growing productivity dividend, the dream of a more balanced life ... risks slipping out of reach for many Australians,\" it says.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Anthony Albanese announces new move to tackle Australia's productivity problem\n\nSince 1980, Australians have used about 23 per cent of their productivity dividend \u2014 the savings from increasing productivity via automation and technological advancements \u2014 to work less, and banked the other 77 per cent as higher income.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report notes that Australians have opted to use those savings to upgrade their lifestyles, such as buying fancier coffee and taking more expensive holidays, rather than further shortening their workdays.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's hoped artificial intelligence (AI) will drive further productivity improvements, and unions want these benefits to be shared with workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nANMF federal secretary Annie Butler says the union believes shorter working weeks will promote gender equality because it will allow caring responsibilities to be more easily shared between partners, as noted in a 2023 report by the Senate Select Committee on Work and Care.\n\n\n\nAustralian Nursing and Midwifery Federation federal secretary Annie Butler says the union supports shorter working hours. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas \"By changing the definition of 'full-time' work and encouraging a culture shift away from a focus on hours to that of productivity and work quality, the reduced hour model may lead to the removal of some of the barriers to women's professional advancement,\" the committee's report says.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart-time jobs may also be better paid because working for two days would be considered \"half a full-time equivalent\".\n\n\n\n\n\nButler says shorter working weeks would have a positive effect on women's workforce participation, increase the number of hours workers have to balance their well-being and care responsibilities, and ultimately improve retention.\n\n\n\nCould a four-day week be backed by government?\n\nThe Greens also support the introduction of a four-day work week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It's] a better way to work and one that puts the health and happiness of workers first, while allowing the productivity of businesses to soar,\" Greens spokesperson for jobs and employment, Senator Barbara Pocock, says.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a win for workers and a win for workplaces.\n\nAs part of its election campaign, the Greens supported bringing a test case to the Fair Work Commission and establishing a national institute to guide implementation of a four-day work week.\n\n\n\n\n\nPocock says the Greens remain committed to the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese told The Australian newspaper this week he would support practical measures from the productivity roundtable that had broad support from business, unions and civil society.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says he is looking for productivity measures that have broad support. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas The Coalition, which walked back a proposal to force Canberra public servants back into the office five days a week during the federal election campaign , appeared non-committal when asked whether it supported the four-day work week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Liberals believe in agency and empowerment,\" Coalition spokesperson for industrial relations and employment Tim Wilson said in a statement to SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Improving standards of living comes from partnerships to get ahead through salaries, startups, shareholdings and small business, and we are going to back Australians to back themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are benefits to a shorter working week, Hopkins' research on the four-day work week also identified several challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes overcoming scepticism about its potential to increase productivity, making changes to roster systems so that staff can maintain services over five days, and the management of part-time workers.\n\n\n\nHopkins says moving to a four-day work week is not easy; it takes planning and piloting, but the businesses that have introduced the policy have stuck with it and seen the benefits, including being better able to attract and retain talented staff.\n\n\n\nFamilies have changed since the 1950s\n\nDemographer Liz Allen, from the Australian National University, says providing extra workplace flexibility could help couples manage the stresses of family life, but it was only one part of the puzzle if authorities want to boost Australia's declining birthrate , which is now at a record low of 1.5 babies per woman.\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues such as housing affordability, economic security, gender equality and climate change also need to be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says many Australians are struggling to raise families within systems that have been developed based on outdated gender norms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it comes to unpaid household work, men are not doing their fair share, and that's not the fault of men, that's how we've been conditioned,\" she says.\n\n\n\nOur tax system, our workplace system, all manner of things, are trapping us in this 1950s model of the perfect family.\n\n\"Family doesn't look like that anymore, family has changed, and the structural supports have not kept [up] with the times.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAllen says it may be time to go back to the drawing board rather than continue \"trying to fit a square peg into a round hole\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We keep beating ourselves up because we can't get it to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We lack the vision to do something different.\"\n\n\n\nPeople want a share of the time saved by AI\n\nWhile arrangements such as working from home have delivered time savings for some workers, not everyone benefits from this.\n\n\n\n\n\nHopkins says only about a third of jobs are remote-capable.\n\n\n\n[Some] people feel like they've been left behind. Their white collar colleagues have all of a sudden gained all this flexibility and ability to work from home over the last few years and they haven't gained anything.\n\nHowever, improved rostering and better access to holidays could help these workers, says Hopkins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may also be scope to consider whether a worker can perform some elements of their role at home, such as a train driver who may also have administrative tasks and logbooks to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI may help employees work faster and Hopkins says \"people want a share in the time that's saved\".\n\n\n\nWorkers want a share of the time saved by new technology such as AI.

In a common-sense world, the Jac Morgan cleanout on Carlo Tizzano in the dying moments of the Wallabies\u2019 29-26 shouldn\u2019t be a penalty - the Welshman was low enough to generate the power to drive through Tizzano and get him off the ball.\n\nBut that is not the way rugby has been officiated for years. Anyone who has watched any volume of rugby for the past six years has seen similar incidents, or less, pored over incessantly by TMOs, producing penalties or even cards. Fans know, coaches know it and players know it - in fact TMOs are obliged to come in if a player is exhibiting signs of head contact. It was therefore an extraordinary moment for rugby to rediscover its common sense, and that is why former Wallabies and Lions were vehemently opposed in their reading of the incident - in a sense they were both right.\n\nOne of the match officials, Ben O\u2019Keeffe, could be heard on the microphone saying, \u201cThere may have been head contact but there was no foul play\u201d. Wallabies captain Harry Wilson produced one of the greatest leaves in MCG history when he opted not to comment on the incident post-match. There was little wonder the bloke was confused and upset.",

Picture: NewsWire/ Martin Ollman\n\nAnthony Albanese has said he believes Israel has \u201cquite clearly\u201d breached international law through its treatment of innocent civilians in Gaza, but will not follow French President Emmanuel Macron and formally recognise a Palestinian State when he heads to the United Nations General Assembly in September.\n\nThis follows global condemnation of Israel for restricting aid to civilians trapped in Gaza, with health authorities reporting 123 people have died of starvation and malnutrition.\n\nThe Israeli military has since said it will begin aid airdrops, and establish humanitarian corridors for United Nations convoys to allow for the delivery of food.\n\nSpeaking to ABC on Sunday, the Prime Minister said he was heartbroken by the images of starving children coming out of Gaza.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile he welcomed the resumption of aid as \u201ca start,\u201d he reiterated the condemnation of civilian deaths as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and \u201ccompletely indefensible\u201d.\n\nAnthony Albanese said he was personally heartbroken over the photos coming out of Gaza, with the death toll from starvation and malnourishment increasing. Picture: Omar Al-Qarraa/ AFP\n\nA photo taken from the Shait refugee camp in Gaza, picturing a woman, Naima Abu Ful holding her malnourished two-year-old child, Yazan. Picture: AP Photo/ Jehad Alshrafi\n\n\u201cThis is a start, but we need to make sure that people who are innocent \u2026 including the young boy who people will have seen that image of just breaks your heart, a one-year-old boy is not a Hamas fighter,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen pressed, Mr Albanese also said Israel\u2019s actions are \u201cquite clearly\u201d a breach of international law, given \u201cinternational law says that you can\u2019t hold innocent people responsible for what is a conflict\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a supporter of Israel and Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, but that boy isn\u2019t challenging Israel\u2019s right to existence, and nor are the many who continue to suffer from the unavailability of food and water,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Albanese said Israel had \u201cquite clearly\u2019 breached international law through its treatment of innocent people. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nHowever, Australia will not follow France, who has become the first large Western power to confirm it will formally recognise Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly, joining about 75 per cent of member states.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Albanese said that, while Australia \u201cwill make a decision at an appropriate time,\u201d there needed to be more detail on how a Palestinian state would function before he was comfortable making that commitment.\n\n\u201cHow do you exclude Hamas from any involvement there? How do you ensure that a Palestinian State operates in an appropriate way which does not threaten the existence of Israel?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd so we won\u2019t do any decision as a gesture. We will do it as a way forward, if the circumstances are met.\u201d\n\nCoalition foreign affairs spokeswoman Michaelia Cash criticised Mr Albanese for not putting more blame on Hamas and its continued refusal to release hostages taken on October 7, 2023.\n\nHowever, Mr Albanese has made repeated comments calling on Hamas to release the hostages, and has reiterated his condemnation of the terrorist organisation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSenator Cash added that while the statement said that Australia wants to \u201cto see the end of the war in Gaza,\u201d the \u201cnext sentence should have been: \u2018And we call on the terrorists Hamas, who commenced this war and who are ensuring the suffering of the civilians in Gaza to end this war tomorrow\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u201cDoes Israel have a moral responsibility? Yes. Should Israel be getting more aid in to civilians in Gaza? Absolutely,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd I call on the Israeli government to work with the international agencies to get that aid to the civilians but let us not be blind \u2026 to the reality.\u201d",
