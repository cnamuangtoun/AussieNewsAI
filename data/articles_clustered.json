    "text": "There are just three weeks of action left in the regular NFL season, and while the perennially in contention Chiefs have been knocked out already, another contender suffered a major blow to its defence.\n\nHere are the five quick hits from the week 15 action.\n\n1. Mahomes tears his ACL as Kansas City's season ends\n\nPatrick Mahomes tore the ACL in his left knee while trying to keep the Kansas City Chiefs's post-season hopes alive in the waning seconds of a 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, and the team said the star quarterback was considering surgical options.\n\nIt's the most significant injury of a superlative nine-year career for Mahomes, a two-time MVP who has led the Chiefs to three Super Bowl titles and reached the AFC championship game in each of his seven previous seasons as Kansas City's starter.\n\nThis year, the Chiefs won't even make the playoffs, and Mahomes won't be back on the field until sometime in 2026.\n\nThe Chiefs had just crossed midfield with less than two minutes to go when Mahomes scrambled toward the Kansas City sideline, then tried to get rid of the ball. He was spun to the ground upon release by Chargers defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand, and he immediately grabbed at his left knee while trainers converged on him.\n\nMahomes was eventually helped to the blue injury tent on the sideline, but he only stayed there for a few moments. He soon emerged with staff members on either side of him, limping toward the locker room with a white towel draped over his head.\n\n\"He will get an MRI tomorrow or this evening,\" coach Andy Reid said.\n\n\"Whenever we can.\"\n\n2. Packers star Parsons hurts his knee as Green Bay suffers costly loss\n\nGreen Bay Packers pass rushing star Micah Parsons was helped off the field after injuring his left knee on a non-contact play late in the third quarter against Denver.\n\nHe was later ruled out of the game.\n\nParsons blew past right tackle Mike McGlinchey and was chasing after Broncos quarterback Bo Nix when he suddenly pulled up and fell to the ground. He clutched his knee as trainers and teammates came over to check on him.\n\nIt was the second significant injury for the Packers, who lost receiver Christian Watson to a chest injury.\n\nParsons was having a big game. He forced an early fumble and was credited with a pass break-up.\n\nWithout their star defender, the Packers went down 34-26 in a loss that could have major playoff ramifications.\n\n3. Old man Rivers throws a touchdown as students watch on\n\nMuch was made of the return of 44-year-old father of 10 and grandfather of one Philip Rivers to the NFL this week, and the old man almost pulled off a miracle for the Colts.\n\nRivers, who came out of retirement and signed to the Colts last week after a string of injuries to the team's quarterbacks, threw a touchdown as Indianapolis lost 18-16 to the Seahawks thanks to a last minute record-breaking field goal by Jason Myers.\n\nRivers only threw for 120 yards and did toss an interception in a moment of desperation late in the game, but he showed enough that he should be able to keep the starting position until his injured teammates return.\n\nThe former Chargers legend now coaches at a high school, with vision showing his students getting up and about after their coach threw the TD against one of the best defences in the league.\n\n4. Trump's coin toss goes viral during Army-Navy game\n\nStill on American Football but away from the NFL, US President Donald Trump went viral with a bizarre attempt at a coin toss before a Navy and Army game.\n\nThe 79-year-old was handed the coin to decide which team would receive the ball, and then proceeded to loft the coin into the air, rather than the more \u2014 traditional \u2014 flick of the coin.\n\n\"President Trump's coin toss will go down in the history books,\" Barstool Sports wrote on X, with the video seen more than 4 million times.\n\nNavy went on to beat Army 17-16 in a tight clash.\n\n5. Commanders end their losing streak, hand one to the Giants\n\nMarcus Mariota emerged from the Washington Commanders's first victory celebration since October 5 with a sense of relief.\n\nBeating the New York Giants 29-21 ended their season-derailing skid at eight games.\n\n\"There's nothing like a winning locker room,\" Mariota said.\n\n\"It's hard to go two months without winning a football game.\"\n\nNow their opponent is stuck with that feeling. The Giants (2-12), who lost their eighth in a row, have not won since October 9.\n\nThe only NFL game this week with no playoff implications had a far bigger bearing on draft positioning.\n\nThe Giants in defeat moved a step closer to the top pick, a last-place finish in the NFC East and potentially front-office changes, with a coaching search already coming.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "Sam Kerr has shown it's time for her to be restored to her customary starting role as Chelsea's top striker as she came off the bench to dominate Brighton and help the English champions to a 3-0 win away.\n\nIt's now two years since the Matildas great started a Women's Super League (WSL) match for the Blues after she was left to warm the bench again by Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor.\n\nBut the way she helped reinvigorate Chelsea in the second half at Brighton's Broadfield Stadium demonstrated that Bompastor must surely employ the 32-year-old more after the winter break if they're to win the league for the seventh successive season.\n\nThey go into the break six points adrift of leaders Manchester City, who beat Aston Villa 6-1 with four goals from Jamaican star Khadija Shaw.\n\nWithout Kerr on the field, the stuttering champs again looked toothless up front in the first 45 minutes, with only a remarkable solo run and shot from French fullback Sandy Baltimore just before the break giving them a half-time lead.\n\nOnce Kerr and Wieke Kaptein had been brought on for the second half, though, Chelsea looked like a different team up front, with the Matildas star bringing more of a robust physical presence and directness than Aggie Beever-Jones.\n\nThe only frustration for Kerr once again was that she didn't end up on the scoresheet herself, having had one rasping shot and a superb diving header kept out by Brighton's busy keeper Sophie Baggaley.\n\nKerr's now scored just four goals in 16 matches for club and country since her comeback in September from the ACL injury that kept her out for so long. In 11 of those matches, though, Kerr has been a substitute.\n\nElsewhere in the WSL, West Ham's Australian captain Katrina Gorry was left ruing a missed late chance, which could have given her side victory in the foot-of-the-table clash against Liverpool. It ended 2-2 with Liverpool still bottom on three points and the Hammers a place above on five.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "The state government has trucked water to two of Western Australia's wettest towns day in, day out for the past 15 years at a cost of at least $4 million \u2014 so far.\n\nQuinninup and Northcliffe, 350 kilometres south of Perth, receive an average of 1 metre of rain a year.\n\nHowever, the towns' water schemes are exclusively supplied by contractors trucking in potable water from neighbouring towns Pemberton or Manjimup, 50km away.\n\nMary Williams often counts the water trucks passing by her old mill cottage in the hamlet of Quinninup, where she has lived for 25 years.\n\n\"It must be costing them a fortune,\" Ms Williams said.\n\nHer record was a dozen in a single summer's day, but she wonders how many more will come.\n\n\"How many more trucks are they going to keep running?\" she asked.\n\n\"Is it going to be eventually that we're going to have trucks nose-to-tail just to keep water in the community?\"\n\nMary Williams says a better solution to water carting needs to be found. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\n'Cost-effective' water solution\n\nThe Cook government insists it is the most practical solution for the small towns with a combined population of about 450 people.\n\n\"Current demand and population forecasts for these towns remain modest, and there has been no change that would warrant moving away from carting as the most efficient supply method,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"Over the past decade, average annual carting costs have been approximately $200,000 per scheme, ensuring a cost-effective and dependable service.\"\n\nMary Williams says her town needs a long-term water solution. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nThe trucks offer little comfort to residents during the summer, when visitor numbers swell and bushfire risk intensifies.\n\nMs Williams fears it was inevitable that a fire would sweep through Quinninup, with residents having few household means of defending their homes.\n\n\"There is no such thing as stay and defend. We get out,\" she said.\n\nNot a drop to drink\n\nBoth towns once had their own local sources of drinking water, but these were defunct due to quality concerns.\n\nKarri Lake is a 56-gigalitre dam in Quinninup, which also has a mothballed water treatment plant a few hundred metres from the town.\n\nThe lake was proclaimed a drinking water source in the early 2000s, but was reverted to a recreational dam in 2009 by the state-owned water agency, the Water Corporation.\n\nQuinninup's Karri Lake is no longer a drinking water source because of water quality concerns. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nIt came to view the lake as a \"risky\" drinking water source due to nearby residential septic systems.\n\nIt is a familiar story at Northcliffe, where town water was once drawn from a spring-fed dam on Michael Armstrong's family farm to the east of town.\n\nMichael Armstrong says it is \"stupidity\" that water is carted into the wettest towns in the state. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\n\"It was a gentleman's agreement with my grandmother, my father and then me,\" Mr Armstrong said.\n\nMr Armstrong said the deal ended in 2010 when the then-Department of Water decided the source needed to be better protected from contamination.\n\n\"They were talking about limiting my future growth and also planting trees on a considerable area of my land that ran into that source,\" he said.\n\nThose decisions coincided with a shift in national drinking water quality guidelines, prioritising proactive protection of water sources.\n\nThe Water Corporation stopped using Northcliffe's local water source in 2010 and has trucked in water since. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nIn 2013, Water Corporation chief operating officer Peter Moore told a parliamentary standing committee that guidelines had shifted to more proactive measures to protect water sources.\n\nHe said that explained why Northcliffe's water source was abandoned.\n\n\"They have gone to looking not so much on just testing and analysing but looking to numbers of barriers you have in place as protections,\" Mr Moore said.\n\n\"So, you are restructuring your whole scheme based on barriers.\n\n\"Source protection was the first barrier, treatment is the second barrier and so on and so forth.\"\n\nNorthcliffe is WA's wettest town, receiving more than a metre of rain each year. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nDaily water carting has been viewed as the most economical option ever since.\n\n\"It's stupidity,\" Mr Armstrong said.\n\n\"We're the wettest town in the state, and we're getting water carted in from out of town.\"\n\nWater trucks and a drying climate\n\nWater Corporation's 2015 Water Forever: South West report identified several alternatives, including water pipelines from Pemberton, a new surface water dam at Northcliffe and a micro-desalination plant at Windy Harbour.\n\nA Water Corporation spokesperson said none of the alternatives were viable.\n\n\"Groundwater investigations identified low-yield aquifers and quality risks. A new dam is not feasible due to constrained land availability and environmental constraints,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThose options were also considered too costly, given the modest water needs of Quinninup and Northcliffe, which have the lowest scheme water demand in the South West region.\n\nThe pipeline, for instance, was estimated to cost a combined $61 million.\n\nDon Punch says the cost of water infrastructure for Northcliffe and Quinninup is \"huge\" and that makes carting viable. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nLast month, WA Water Minister Don Punch told the ABC the cost of building infrastructure for towns like Northcliffe was huge, making water carting a \"viable option\".\n\n\"That's not ideal but it's a solution that applies to that community at this point in time,\" Mr Punch said.\n\nThe South West towns of Quinninup and Northcliffe have had drinking water carted in for the past 15 years. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nMany residents question whether millions of taxpayer dollars spent on carting water would have been better invested in a permanent fix long ago.\n\n\"It doesn't take long for that four million or five million or 10 million [dollars] to be sucked up and spat out the other end,\" Mr Armstrong said.\n\nBoth towns are forecast to double water usage from 28 megalitres of water a year to 60 megalitres by 2060.\n\nPrevious state government modelling predicts rainfall could decline by up to 25 per cent by then under a worst-case scenario.\n\nManjimup Shire President Donelle Buegge said these communities needed a long-term solution sooner rather than later.\n\nDonelle Buegge says residents are desperate for a long-term water solution. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\n\"We are going to be one of the hardest hit in a drying climate,\" she said.\n\nMs Williams said the year-round movement of water trucks through the southern karri forests was easy to ignore when so few people could hear them.\n\n\"I think [the government] think it's a problem they'd hope would go away. If they ignore it enough, it doesn't exist,\" she said.",

    "text": "It's no secret a lot of people in Australia play video games.\n\nIn fact, the latest Australia Plays report, conducted by Bond University and commissioned by peak body Interactive Games and Entertainment Association (IGEA), suggests video games are played in almost nine out of 10 Aussie households.\n\nIt's not child's play either, with the report showing the average age of gamers is 35.\n\nAnd in 2025, for the first time ever in the survey (which has been conducted since 2014) more women are gaming than men, with 51 per cent playing regularly.\n\nWhether you're playing word games regularly or picking up a controller with the family for some couch co-op, the cultural impact of games extends to our museums and to our festivals for interactive theatre events.\n\nWe have collected the thoughts of a diverse range of ABC writers who love this medium, and they present their picks for the games that have found a place in their hearts this year.\n\nDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach\n\nNorman Reedus stars as Sam Bridges in Hideo Kojima's game Death Stranding 2: On The Beach which is set in Australia. (Supplied: PlayStation Studios)\n\nHideo Kojima \u2014 gaming's most delightfully idiosyncratic auteur \u2014 returns to the post-apocalyptic world of Death Stranding with the long-awaited sequel, On The Beach.\n\nThis time he trades the first game's Icelandic-inspired North America for Australia, dropping Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) into harsh, barren landscapes that feel uncannily familiar: equal parts beautiful and ominous.\n\nUnshackling itself from the original's meditative \"delivery game\" loop, Death Stranding 2 leans harder into action and stealth, recalling flashes of Kojima's earlier Metal Gear Solid work.\n\nThe result is a kind of Kojima-greatest-hits-package \u2014 stranger, punchier, and more confident in its weirdness.\n\nWhy Hideo Kojima set Death Stranding 2: On The Beach in Australia We were invited to talk to Hideo Kojima about sequels, storytelling, and why Australia is the perfect place to end the world.\n\nWith On The Beach, Kojima also continues to blur the lines between video games and cinema (his Instagram bio literally reads \"70% of my body is made of movies\"), bringing some of his filmmaking idols like George Miller and Hollywood heavyweights such as Elle Fanning into key roles.\n\nIn the end, Death Stranding 2 doesn't just follow up the first game \u2014 it challenges it.\n\nIt's still about connection and survival, but in today's fractured, hyper-connected world, it's also about what we lose when we assume being \"linked\" is the same as being together.\n\nWhether you traverse its dusty roads or skip it entirely, this sequel leaves you asking: Should we have connected?\n\n\u2014 Angus Truskett\n\nHades II\n\nHades II builds on the rogue-lite gameplay of the first game, with lead character Melino\u00eb battling through levels that change every time you play. Dying is an important part of the process. (Supplied: Supergiant Games)\n\nHades II and its predecessor managed to do something that no other game has achieved for me \u2014 make me feel OK about repeatedly failing.\n\nNormally in most run-based games, where I'm retreading the same path again and again, I hit a point where I just cannot make any further progress, and I move on to something else.\n\nWith Hades II, the engaging and developing narrative and accumulation of resources that persist between deaths make every run feel meaningful; I'm always going to get something for my efforts.\n\nThe stunning voice acting and characterisation of the Supergiant's version of the Greek pantheon in this sequel is far more developed. Each incidental boss or side character comments on your progress, notes that you have met before and, again, congratulates or chides you.\n\nUnlike a lot of other challenging rogue-lite games, I never feel like my time is being wasted, or that I'm being punished unfairly.\n\nEach victory feels just within grasp and, when you finally succeed, it's exhilarating.\n\nDarren Korb's soundtrack is filled with pumping guitar and electronic trills. The musical-themed battles of Scylla and the Sirens are an absolute delight, leaving you wondering if you've unlocked a new song each time you meet the undersea pop stars that drive their listeners to obsession.\n\nBut it's the tender, quiet duets like Moonlight Guide Us by Ashley Barrett and Judy Alice Lee that really send a shiver down my spine.\n\nSupergiant initially released the game into early access as a work-in-progress version that was added to over time.\n\nThe story was written around that, too \u2014 which is a masterful move. Characters in the game explained when you'd hit the end of a still-in-development area in a narratively consistent way, and that will never be able to be experienced again now that it's finished.\n\nYou just had to be there, and I'm lucky I was.\n\n\u2014 Gianfranco Di Giovanni\n\nSplit Fiction\n\nSplit Fiction is designed for two players. Each player has different skills and they need to work together to complete tasks across fantasy and science fiction worlds. (Supplied: Hazelight Studios)\n\nAfter winning 2021 Game of the Year at The Game Awards with their charming co-op It Takes Two, all eyes were on Hazelight Studios to see what high-octane tricks they would pull out to follow their hit.\n\nAnd after the release of Split Fiction in April, the answer became clear \u2014 they pulled out all of them.\n\nThe mile-a-minute adventure swaps marital crisis for an enemies-to-friends journey between two aspiring authors; cynical sci-fi nerd Mio and optimistic fantasy-lover Zoe.\n\nBoth are lured to the monolithic Rader Publishing with the promise of trying out a new technology and maybe landing a contract.\n\nBut villainous tech bro JD Rader's real plan is to eradicate the concept of an author altogether, replacing writers with an army of AI to fill shelves and line his pockets.\n\nAn accident with Rader's tech test sees Mio and Zoe thrown into various stories of their own creation as they battle together to make it back to reality and thwart the boss.\n\nIn a similar fashion to It Takes Two, players must cooperate to jump, dash, climb and rappel over incredible landscapes.

All this is taking place while solving puzzles and mastering new features embedded in the numerous levels.\n\nHazelight very much went for the spaghetti method with Split Fiction, throwing everything at the wall, and most of it sticks.\n\nWhile it might not be as fresh and original as its predecessor, it's endless and accessible fun for any level of gamer.\n\n\u2014 Velvet Winter\n\nBlue Prince\n\nAn ever-shifting puzzle game, make sure you're writing down your own notes when playing Blue Prince, otherwise you'll quickly become lost. (Supplied: Dogubomb)\n\nThe subtle double meaning behind the name of this puzzling adventure captures its enigmatic charm perfectly.\n\nAs you explore the ever-changing assortment of rooms in Mt Holly Manor, get ready to be intrigued, entranced and utterly, hopelessly absorbed trying to find the elusive Room 46.\n\nThe simple controls, muted colours and faint, elegant music rightfully allow Blue Prince's spectacular story to take precedence.\n\nWhile gaming knowledge isn't required, a love for complicated puzzles is essential.\n\nThe blueprint of this mysterious manor changes daily and juggling the balance of finding resources and avoiding dead ends as you draw room tiles, as well as fatigue, is a challenging enough conundrum on its own.\n\nHowever, the glimpses into the story and the metaphorical puzzle pieces of information you receive make the challenge worth it.\n\nThe mystery of Mt Holly and its previous inhabitants will worm its way into your brain and re-emerge long after you have stepped away from your first play session, beckoning you back to explore its halls once more.\n\nThe only slightly negative critique I have for this game is that it should come with a notebook, because if you want to have a chance at solving this one, you will find the game's suggestion that you write things down is not optional.\n\n\u2014 Naomi Jackson\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong broke records when it launched, crashing online stores for PC and console players, but mystery surrounded most of its development.

(Supplied: Nintendo EPD)\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza will be on a lot of GOTY lists this year.\n\nIn Bananza, DK and his friend Pauline must crash through an entire planet to reach the core and the riches that lie within.\n\nFor DK, it's about obtaining a banana horde. For Pauline, it's finding a way home to the surface.\n\nFor the player, it's a great excuse to wreck everything in sight.\n\nBananza's central gameplay mechanic is that DK can destroy the world around him. There is no problem that can't be solved by simply smashing through a wall.\n\nDK is a wrecking ball. Little can stand in his way, and the novelty of tearing through rock on your way to a specific goal never wears off.\n\nIn 2025, games like Bananza are increasingly rare.\n\nNone of the shareholder-pleasing, revenue-raising cruft that has come to define major games in the 2020s (live service, mandatory multiplayer, micro-transactions, etc) is present here.\n\nThe prioritisation of additional revenue streams is a symptom of an industry that can no longer derive profit from a high number of copies sold.\n\nNintendo continues to take a more old-school approach: produce fun games at a high level of quality, and the rest will take care of itself.\n\nThrough this, Donkey Kong Bananza reminds us what a great video game looks like, and why we fell in love with games in the first place.\n\nFun, challenge, joy, a sense of accomplishment, all packed into a cartridge no bigger than an SD card.\n\n\u2014 David Smith\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 scooped the pool at this year's Game Awards, taking home a record nine trophies, including the coveted Game of the Year.

Its captivating story. Its precise, brutal and utterly addictive combat. The way it captures a perfect storm of emotions \u2014 the intersection between despair and devotion.\n\nAll of those things are true and not one could exist to its fullest without the other.\n\nComposer's first game soundtrack is set to be one of the biggest of 2025 The music for indie game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has racked up millions of streams. It is first game soundtrack Lorien Testard has made.\n\nBut it was this one line, spoken during an encounter with an NPC in an optional side quest in the late game, after hours of dancing on an emotional knife-edge, that truly shattered me: \"He just wants you to fly.\"\n\nI can't really explain why I had such a visceral reaction without a whiteboard, a family mental health plan and a bottle of medical-grade disinfectant, but the result remains the same \u2014 Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made me cry so hard that I threw up.\n\nNow is that a common criteria for my game of the year? No.\n\nBut how incredible is it for a game to be able to impact someone so dramatically?\n\nTo wrap them up in a story so completely and so easily that it can draw out so much emotion \u2014 a testament to the work that has gone into creating such a beautiful, captivating, brutal and utterly addictive world.\n\nMy carpet may never be the same, but hey, that's a fair price to pay for such a phenomenal game.\n\n\u2014 Gemma Driscoll\n\nDispatch\n\nEveryone loves feeling like a superhero in video games, but in Dispatch you'll be sending a group of supes out on missions all while managing office politics. (Supplied: AdHoc Studios)\n\nDispatch is one of those games that, on paper, shouldn't be nearly as compelling as it is.\n\nIt's an eight-part episodic 'choose your own adventure' game set in a world full of superheroes and supervillains. The catch is you, Robert Robertson, have no powers.\n\nWell that's not entirely true; depending on how you play Robert, his power might actually be endless patience for the metric shit-tonne of roasting he gets from his charges \u2014 a small band of ex-villains called the Z Team.\n\nBeing the person to send out the people with powers to do cool missions whilst you babysit a progress bar doesn't sound like a high-tension endeavour.\n\nThat is, until you have four heroes on a mandatory rest break, two out of commission and five separate crimes taking place, the clock ticking down on each of them and you're wondering how it's possible for the one gig you took a chance on letting Waterboy handle has somehow gone so thoroughly awry that the city is facing flooding.\n\nAll that is to say, Dispatch is very good at keeping you on your toes in more ways than one.\n\nIt also manages to pack in a hell of a lot of heart, giving you characters to love, to hate, to love to hate and every emotion in between.\n\nWith so few words, it's hard to properly convey how sick some of the design choices in Dispatch are but suffice to say, as a disciple of the emotional car wreck that was Telltale's The Walking Dead series, it was awesome to see that same sparkle on display.\n\n\u2014 Gemma Driscoll\n\nGhost of Y\u014dtei\n\nA r\u014dnin story set on the island of Yo\u0304tei, this sequel channels the filmic legacy of Akira Kurosawa and modern anime like Samurai Champloo. (Supplied: Suckerpunch Productions)\n\nHonour or freedom? That was the heartbreaking choice that players wrestled with in Sucker Punch Productions' Ghost of Tsushima (2020).\n\nThe anticipated sequel, Ghost of Y\u014dtei, asks a more personal question: are those who live for revenge truly alive?\n\nAtsu, a battle-hardened r\u014dnin, returns to Ezo seeking revenge against a powerful gang of outlaws, the Y\u014dtei Six, for the murder of her family.\n\nAs Atsu attacks its outposts across Ezo, she earns fear and respect as \"the onry\u014d\", a vengeful spirit.\n\nCombat in Y\u014dtei is straightforward. Most battles with the Y\u014dtei Six can be decided with katanas, but Atsu learns many distinctive combat forms, including the Yari, Kusarigama and Tanegashima.\n\nLike Tsushima, which won The Game Award for Best Art Direction in 2020, the centrepiece of Y\u014dtei is a rolling open world featuring the most breathtaking vistas in all of gaming.\n\nFrom wild horses running free through Y\u014dtei Grasslands, to smouldering villages in Ishikari Plains, the beauty of Ezo \u2014 and its scars of oppression \u2014 are on display in frightening clarity.\n\nPlayers are invited to savour Ezo, with guiding winds and golden songbirds enticing players away from the beaten path to points of interest.\n\nThe films of Akira Kurosawa are a clear influence on Y\u014dtei, but this strong sense of cinema can oust player choice and control for brief moments.\n\nGhost of Y\u014dtei is a worthy successor to Tsushima, and anyone who enjoyed Tsushima will find a similarly thrilling, strangely calming, inescapably tragic tale of revenge at any cost.\n\n\u2014 Joshua Wong\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance II\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance II sells itself as a grounded and realistic recreation of medieval Bohemia, which is now the modern-day Czech Republic. (Supplied: Warhorse Studios)\n\nAt the opening of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Henry of Skalitz is much as you left him \u2014 a peasant-turned-nobleman with all the armour, weapons and pride to prove it.\n\nHowever, like most sequels, much of that is quickly stripped away leaving Henry in rags, penniless and in a strange new land where allies and enemies are hard to tell apart.\n\nBut his mission remains: to unite a kingdom against a new monarch whose violent seizure of the throne has sparked civil war, closely following the real-life ousting of King Wenceslas of Bohemia (now the modern-day Czech Republic).\n\nEverything that makes this game special can be traced to its precursor. Released in 2018, Kingdom Come: Deliverance transported players into a grounded recreation of 15th-century central Europe.\n\nImmersion is woven into every aspect of the experience.\n\nYou manage Henry's hunger, mend his wounds, repair his armour and even sharpen his weapons when they become dull.\n\nYou can even visit a bathhouse to clean your clothes and get a fresh haircut (which grants a temporary charisma boost, of course).\n\nNo fantasy or otherworldly elements get thrown into the mix. This is a slow-paced, first-person, role-playing game deeply invested in tactile gameplay and consistent realism.\n\nWhether you're visiting vendors in a faithfully recreated medieval city, duelling to the death with all manner of weapons, or riding through the countryside on horseback.\n\nFor some, the pace may prove slow and tedious. But for the patient, a compelling narrative, gorgeous open world and rich role-playing journey awaits.\n\n\u2014 Don Sheil",

    "text": "Alex Carey has warned that Adelaide may not be the batter's paradise England expect, with data showing the wicket won't necessarily be easier to bat on with a red ball.\n\nStaring down the barrel of an irredeemable 3-0 series deficit, England coach Brendon McCullum predicted on Sunday that the Adelaide pitch would suit England's style this week.\n\nThe tourists are known to prefer flatter wickets, with England's home pitches becoming better for batting in recent years.\n\nBatting averages by Test venue over past decade SCG: 36.38 MCG: 30.54 Gabba: 28.39 Adelaide Oval (day-night): 28.07 Perth Stadium: 27.23 Adelaide Oval (day): 22.77 Bellerive Oval: 18.40\n\nAdelaide has traditionally provided just that, being long regarded as the best wicket in Australia to bat on over the past 50 years, before the introduction of a pink ball.\n\nBut the numbers now suggest otherwise, regardless of ball colour.\n\nWhile only two red-ball Tests have been played at the ground over the past 10 years, the highest team total in either of them is India's 307 against Australia in 2018.\n\nWickets have in fact fallen at a quicker rate than in pink-ball matches, with batting averages also lower in red-ball games.\n\nStatistically, only Bellerive in Hobart has proven a harder venue for players to score runs in Tests over the past decade, when accounting for both day and day-night Tests.\n\nCarey said it was wrong to think Adelaide was only good for batters.\n\n\"In terms of flatness, I think Adelaide is very consistent, which doesn't make it a batting paradise the whole time,\" Carey said.\n\n\"There is always something with the new ball, but there is always something for the batters to score big runs.\n\n\"I love playing here, Trav [Head] loves playing here, the Australian cricket team loves playing here. I think there will be enough in it for bat and ball.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\n\"Sheffield Shield wickets this year have been great for batting and bowling. A bit of spin comes into it late.\"\n\nPotentially working into England's favour is the fact the pitch doesn't traditionally offer as much bounce as Perth and the Gabba, where the tourists have been well beaten.\n\nSeven centuries have been scored on it across four Shield games this summer, in a season where the Gabba has been the most batter-friendly of all Test venues.\n\n\"I think these conditions should suit our style a little bit better as well,\" McCullum said.\n\n\"[They] are going to be quite different to what we've faced in both the Gabba and at Perth as well.\n\n\"We just need to chisel away at some of the things we haven't got quite right and make sure that we still have that conviction in what we're trying to achieve.\n\n\"It doesn't mean we couldn't have been a success from previously, but this is probably more attuned to our best style of cricket.\"\n\nABC Sport will be live blogging all the action from Adelaide Oval on Wednesday.

    "text": "Star Sydney Sixers recruit Babar Azam failed to follow up the pre-match lightning with his own fireworks as the Perth Scorchers posted a five-wicket win in the BBL season opener at Perth Stadium.\n\nLightning and heavy rain in Perth reduced Sunday's match to an 11-overs-a-side bash, with the Sixers posting 5-113 on the back of an unbeaten 46 off 21 balls from Jack Edwards.\n\nPakistan superstar Azam made just two \u2014 and he was lucky not to get out on two occasions before that \u2014 as the Sixers slumped to 4-41 before Edwards and Josh Philippe (28 off 18) launched a rescue mission.\n\nIn reply, the Scorchers reached their victory target in 10.1 overs on the back of Connolly's 59 off 31 balls, with his knock featuring five sixes and three fours.\n\nThere was drama an hour before the match when spectators were told to leave their seats and seek shelter as lightning started edging closer to the venue.\n\nThe stadium's lights flickered numerous times as the electrical storm gathered intensity.\n\nHuge puddles formed on the turf as more than 15mm of rain fell within the space of an hour.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nPlay eventually began 80 minutes after the original start time, but it wasn't pretty early for the Sixers.\n\nAzam was almost caught on two occasions before he even got off the mark \u2014 the first a flat-batted shot that just floated over Laurie Evans at mid-on, the second an aerial whack over mid-off that landed between two fielders.\n\nHis luck ran out next ball when he flat-batted paceman Brody Couch (2-12) down the ground for an easy catch.\n\nEdwards cracked six fours and two sixes to guide Sydney to a competitive total.\n\nScorchers opener Mitch Marsh fell for a third-ball duck when Azam took a sharp catch at slip, and Finn Allen cracked 16 off eight balls before being snaffled in the deep.\n\nConnolly, who shared the BBL player-of-the-season award with Glenn Maxwell last campaign, kept his cool and ensured the required run-rate never got out of hand.\n\nHe eventually holed out in the deep with just nine runs needed for victory.\n\nAAP",

(Supplied: Pat Cahill)\n\nCloud cover and change in temperature\n\nMonday is forecast to bring cloud cover with a chance of isolated showers across the south-east.\n\nTemperatures are expected to remain warm. Brisbane is forecast to hit a maximum of 34C, the Gold Coast 31C, and Maroochydore 32C.\n\nGladstone is forecast to reach a maximum of 32C, while temperatures could hit 38C in Longreach and 38C in Mt Isa.\n\nTownsville, Mackay and Cairns are all forecast to reach a maximum of 33C.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology's Jordi Cairol said while forecasters were \"not expecting much precipitation\" on Monday, Tuesday would bring a change.\n\nThe weather bureau is forecasting lower temperatures and more rain this week. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\n\"We are expecting more showers and thunderstorms, particularly around the Sunshine Coast, which could have moderate falls of 20 to 25 millimetres,\" he said.\n\n\"Tuesday's cloud cover will also bring a significant change in temperature. It could drop 5 to 6 degrees, down to about 28C.\"\n\nMr Cairol said weather in the state's south-east was broadly expected to clear from Wednesday, with showers \"less likely\".\n\nSevere storms forecast\n\nWhile the weather is forecast to remain relatively mild in the south-east, Mr Cairol said things could be more extreme in central Queensland.\n\nWhat are your options if stormwater runoff damages your property? Who's responsible if your property experiences runoff during heavy rainfall, and what can you do about it?\n\n\"We are expecting severe storms with a risk of heavy rainfall,\" he said.\n\n\"On Tuesday, it will extend towards the southern interior, even reaching the Sunshine Coast and Darling Downs and the New South Wales border.\"\n\nMr Cairol said the storms were forecast to bring heavy rainfall and damaging winds, but no hail was expected.\n\nIn north Queensland, a heatwave warning remains in place for Cape York Peninsula, but that is expected to ease in the coming days.\n\nTemperatures in the state's north have been slightly below average this month, according to the BOM, and showers are expected from Tuesday to Wednesday.\n\nSouth-east still recovering from severe storms\n\nMany residents are still feeling the effects of days of storms that lashed parts of the state, especially the south-east, in late November.\n\nThousands were left without power for days after strong winds, hail and flooding took out power infrastructure and damaged homes.\n\nSix storms over the past three months have brought hail, with the state seeing more than double the usual occurrences of giant hail since July.\n\nMore giant hail than usual has been recorded since July. (Supplied: Kayleen Gordon)\n\nSome of that hail has been especially large, with 14-centimetre hail recorded during a storm in November at Chandler, in Brisbane's south-east, and 11-centimetre hail falling on the city's bayside.\n\nDespite the severe storms, Queensland's December rainfall is sitting slightly below average, while both maximum and minimum temperatures have been broadly above average.\n\nWhat to expect this summer\n\nMr Cairol said the current forecast was not indicating extreme weather around the holiday period.\n\n\"For the next couple of weeks we are looking at an average chance of rain ... nothing unusual,\" he said.\n\n\"For the week from Christmas to New Year we are expecting temperatures to be a little higher than average ... temperatures have been slightly above average in general, particularly in western Queensland.\"",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its tinted wrap-around windscreen and multiple sky-bound rotors, it looks like a cross between a futuristic helicopter and an oversize drone.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, it's an electric air taxi - called the Valo - freshly unveiled by British company Vertical Aerospace in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So our mission at Vertical Aerospace is to deliver electric vertical take-off and landing to the masses. To provide point to point transportation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Vertical Aerospace's chief engineer David King, laying out the company's ambitious vision behind its impressive prototype.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Valo is just one version of what's called an Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft - or evTOL.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the name suggests, and a promotional video shows, it has the ability to take off vertically like a helicopter, but without the noise and pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in the industry, like Mr King, believe it could be the taxi of the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One thing is now slower than it was ten years ago, 30 years ago, 50 years ago, and that's mobility. Mobility in and around populated areas just hasn't kept up. And the solution to that is to unlock the third dimension, it's air mobility, and to be able to provide that to the masses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Valo boasts luxury seating for up to six passengers and speeds of 240 kilometres an hour over distances up to 160 kilometres.\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Aerospace test pilot Simon Davies says, it's a breeze to drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Really it is super simple. You push forward on this lever. It makes you go forward. You pull back on the control stick. It makes you go up. And you just point using the tools you've got and looking out the window. And the aircraft works out how to make it all happen for you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority CASA says it expects to see passenger transport services, or air taxis, up and running in urban areas between 2027 and 2029.\n\n\n\n\n\nClem Newton-Brown is the CEO of Skyportz, a Melbourne-based company that's developed a patented landing surface for electric air taxis that helps address practical concerns like noise and safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the era of air taxi travel is on its way, but the complex infrastructure and regulation required is still catching up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an evolution of the helicopter, which only becomes the revolution that they're talking about when there's a multitude of new landing sites, places such as shopping centers and offices and tourism destinations, things like that. And the problem with that is that landing aircraft in tighter urban locations produces a whole lot of issues around safety and amenity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also scepticism from some about the commercial viability of the air taxi industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Aboulafia, from AeroDynamic Advisory, says it's a competitive market with limited funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know I want to live in a world where I can fly helicopters everywhere. I think most of society would check that box and say: 'Absolutely, get me above that traffic, get me there fast.' Unfortunately, the economics of flying vertically have been about the same for a really long time. And while Vertical has produced an interesting machine, a lot of impressive work going into it, the economics are about the same, maybe a little worse - we don't know - than flying in a helicopter. So it's the same challenges from a business perspective.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Aerospace, who has already received some 1,500 orders for its new Valo aircraft, is not deterred by the challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkyportz CEO Clem Newton-Brown says China and the Middle East are moving rapidly on regulating air spaces for the growing industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says while many aircraft will fail to get to market, developers at the forefront will soon make an impact.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Adelaide: Nathan Lyon and spin bowling have been given a rallying cry by Adelaide Oval\u2019s curator Damian Hough, who declared it is up to cricket\u2019s turf custodians around the country to ensure that slow bowlers aren\u2019t pushed out of the game by green pitches.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the curator at Adelaide where you don\u2019t pick a spinner. Spin needs to play a part here, it always has,\u201d Hough said.\n\nNathan Lyon is expected to return to the Australian team in Adelaide. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cEven last year when he didn\u2019t bowl a lot of overs, I felt that the pitch would have spun, but they were able to take wickets with the quicks. But spin needs to play a part in pitches around Australia, and we want it to play a part.\u201d\n\nAustralia made a shock selection call for the second Test in Brisbane, leaving Lyon out of the team to play without a specialist spinner, instead opting for Michael Neser as a fourth seam bowler. Lyon admitted on the day he was \u201cfilthy\u201d at that decision. But selection chair George Bailey virtually guaranteed on the spot that the veteran tweaker would play in Adelaide.",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe popular Perth showman, known for his theatrical entrances to the oche, delighted in winding up the world matchplay crowd in Blackpool two years ago during the Ashes in full Aussie cricket kit, complete with bat and baggy green, and, naturally, got right royally jeered, even if good-naturedly.\n\nBut \u201cThe Heat\u201d was in a much more sober mood before his fine 3-1 first-round win over Irishman Steve Lennon, evidently feeling a boozed-up crowd at London\u2019s Alexandra Palace might not have taken as kindly to being reminded of England\u2019s current Ashes plight Down Under.",
