    "text": "Remember those bizarre days through the pandemic when knocking elbows replaced shaking hands because it was healthier?\n\nRemember the obsession with cleaning everything with disinfectant wipes?\n\nPens, groceries, desks, even traffic light buttons were wiped every few minutes.\n\nWell, according to the man who led the charge, it was a waste of time.\n\nUnnecessary.\n\nHe also says there are \"other ways\" rather than torturous lockdowns to manage a similar crisis, and even the ever-present hand sanitiser was not particularly useful.\n\nThis issue is like life insurance and next week's huge rent bill.\n\nWe know we have to face it but just want it to go away.\n\nBrett Sutton at a media conference where he announced his resignation as Victoria's chief health officer in 2023. (Joe Armao/The Age)\n\nThe bad news is that another pandemic is inevitable, possibly within the next decade.\n\nFor our own health, we need to work out what went wrong, what worked and what didn't.\n\nAnd here's the man who knows better than anybody the errors and the successes: Professor Brett Sutton, the chief health officer who engineered Victoria's COVID-19 strategy which was one of the toughest in the world.\n\n\"Touching elbows was probably never necessary. They're the things that we learn as we go.\n\n\"And through a hundred years of understanding infectious diseases, we overemphasised the idea that it'll pass through surfaces or handshakes or droplets spread when the reality was, it's in our breath.\n\n\"It's very unlikely to spread through surfaces. You didn't have to wash down the groceries.\n\n\"It's not like washing your hands and using hand sanitiser is a bad thing.\n\n\"But it's probably more important for the bacterial infections that occur in hospitals than it is for pandemic viruses that are mostly about the air we breathe.\"\n\nIn a rare interview, Sutton, who is now with the CSIRO, spoke to my Nine podcast Neil Mitchell asks why?\n\nHe described the pandemic as a \"horror show\" and said he woke up many mornings wanting to quit.\n\nHe says more than most he wants to forget it, but as a society we must not.\n\n\"We don't want to talk about it much. The reality is we should do our utmost by continuing to focus on the planning and prevention so that the response and recovery bits are made easier.\"\n\nThrough those dark days, lockdowns were what damaged the people most.\n\nIn Victoria, there were also curfews and limits on travelling more than five kilometres from home.\n\nBusinesses collapsed, families were traumatised. Society was frozen.\n\nIt began with a national six-week lockdown then states took over.\n\nAn empty Bourke Street during one of Melbourne's marathon lockdowns. (Getty)\n\nAfter a second wave arguably caused by government sloppiness, Victoria reached a total of 262 days locked down by the time vaccination rates built.\n\nNSW was less than half that, and with a million more people, had significantly fewer deaths.\n\nSo, did lockdown work and will the public ever accept it again?\n\n\"Maybe we will agree as a society that we never want to do that (lockdown) again,\" Sutton said.\n\n\"I'm okay with that.\n\n\"There are other ways to manage stuff. And if we all wore masks and we all got vaccinated and we all kept distances without them being mandated.\n\nThat's a potential path we can take.\"\n\nToday, some doctors argue that the COVID impact lingers, particularly with children, through increasing disengagement and school refusal.\n\nSutton agrees the kids did it hard.\n\n\"I think absolutely we should recognise that they made a significant sacrifice when they were least at risk, at medical risk.\n\n\"They made a sacrifice for people who were most at risk, people on chemotherapy, people with immune suppression, people who are very elderly and in nursing homes.\n\n\"The children were constrained in their lives and that didn't benefit them as much as it benefited others.\n\n\"But those other people, by God, needed the support of everyone.\"\n\nBrett Sutton (right) at a 2021 COVID-19 press conference with then-premier Daniel Andrews and COVID-19 commander Jeroen Weimar. (Paul Jeffers)\n\nHe says more work needs to be done to assess Victoria's hardline reaction against other states and countries.\n\n\"We've got opportunities to make comparisons around the world for the places that had four weeks of lockdown, like WA, New Zealand and places that had really long lockdowns.\n\n\"My suspicion, and this is a personal view, is that there's a larger global trend with youth that was maybe amplified through COVID-19 with all the challenges that it presented.\"\n\nSutton is unable to speak about the details of his health orders, partly because of impending court action.\n\nAlthough there has always been suspicion of undue influence by politicians in his decisions , he takes full responsibility and says he was \"in the belly of the beast\".\n\nAnd his mistakes?\n\n\"Probably a list that's too long for this podcast. Speed is of the essence. And so I think decision making around the settings that you should have is probably something that I would reprosecute many times in my mind.\"\n\nSutton mostly works from home, a business trend that emerged through the pandemic.\n\nHe is director of Health and Biosecurity at the CSIRO which means much of his job now is to plan for the future.\n\n\"I think I'm an emotional optimist, but an intellectual pessimist.\n\n\"We've got really profound challenges that will shape the nation and shape the world that are coming like a juggernaut.\n\n\"There's no hard hat-wearing, ribbon-cutting solution that's going to make it all good.\n\n\"I think we've got really, really challenging times ahead.\n\n\"A pandemic might be part of the juggernaut, I hope it's not. We've got enough to worry about on our plate.\"",

    "text": "ABC will reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's late night show in the wake of criticism over his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , officials with the network said.\n\n\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" said a statement from the network.\n\nABC suspended Kimmel indefinitely after comments he made about Kirk, who was killed September 10, in a monologue.\n\nKimmel said \"many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalise on the murder of Charlie Kirk\" and that \"the MAGA gang\" was \"desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel to be reinstated after suspension following Charlie Kirk comments, ABC says. (AP)\n\nKimmel has hosted \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on ABC since 2003 and has been a fixture in television and comedy for even longer. He is also well known as a presenter, having hosted the Academy Awards four times.\n\nBacklash to Kimmel's comments about Kirk was swift. Nexstar and Sinclair, two of ABC's largest affiliate owners, said they would be pulling \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" from their stations. Others, including several fellow comedians, came to his defence.\n\nSinclair said on Monday that it would not air Kimmel's show Tuesday and would broadcast news programming instead.\ufeff\n\n\"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" the company said.\n\nSinclair owns 39 ABC-affiliated TV stations across the US, covering much of the country.\ufeff\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Nexstar on its plans for Kimmel's return.\n\nAndrew Kolvert, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, the organisation founded by Kirk and now headed by his widow, posted on X about Kimmel's reinstatement: \"Disney and ABC caving and allowing Kimmel back on the air is not surprising, but it's their mistake to make. Nexstar and Sinclair do not have to make the same choice.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, one of Kimmel's frequent targets, posted on social media that Kimmel's suspension was \"great news for America.\" He also called for other late night hosts to be fired.\n\nDonald Trump on Jimmy Kimmel's show during his 2016 presidential run. (AP)\n\nKimmel was asked in an interview with Variety this past summer if he was worried that the administration would come after comedians. He expressed concern that a crackdown could be on the way.\n\n\"Well, you'd have to be naive not to worry a little bit,\" he said. \"But that can't change what you're doing.\"\n\nKimmel's suspension arrived in a time when Trump and his administration have pursued threats, lawsuits and federal government pressure to try to exert more control over the media industry. Trump has reached settlements with ABC and CBS over their coverage.\n\nTrump has also filed defamation lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Republicans in Congress stripped federal funding from NPR and PBS.\n\nBrendan Carr, the head of the Federal Communications Commission, issued a warning prior to Kimmel's suspension that criticised Kimmel's remarks about the Kirk assassination.\n\n\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"\n\nCarr denied on Monday that he threatened to revoke ABC's local station licences because of Kimmel's remarks.\n\nDo you think Jimmy Kimmel should have been taken off air? Yes 314 No 1079\n\n\"Jimmy Kimmel is in the situation he's in because of his ratings. Not because of anything that's happened at the federal government level,\" Carr said at the Concordia Annual Summit.\n\nThe suspension also happened at a time when the late night landscape is shifting. CBS announced the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show over the summer.\n\nKimmel's contract with The Walt Disney Co.-owned network had been set to expire in May 2026.\n\nWord of the reinstatement came as hundreds of Hollywood and Broadway stars \u2014 including Robert De Niro, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Selena Gomez, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 urged Americans \"fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights\" in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel's suspension.\n\nMore than 430 movie, TV and stage stars as well as comedians, directors and writers added their names to an open letter Monday from the American Civil Liberties Union that argues it is \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"\n\nAlso Monday, ABC's \"The View\" weighed in on the controversy after not raising it for two episodes after Kimmel was suspended. Co-host Whoopi Goldberg opened the show saying: \"No one silences us\" and she and her fellow hosts condemned Disney's decision.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia in firing line as Israeli leader blasts global superpowers",

    "text": "Over the course of my late-life medical degree, I coined the snazzy phrase, \"First do no harm begins with self-care\".\n\nIt was a play on the Hippocratic oath, designed to empower some of the other, much younger students to look after themselves throughout a high-pressure degree.\n\nDespite regularly advocating for healthy personal and professional boundaries, I wrapped up that degree surprisingly unwell.\n\nPowering on\n\nBy final year, my energy levels had declined and I'd noticed a raft of changes in my body.\n\nBeing a mature-aged student (I was 40 at the time), I told myself I was just getting old. But as we approached graduation, that thought struck a vein of terror. If the perils of age were troubling me this much at medical school, how was I going to survive internship?\n\nMidway through our final exams, I got home from a comedy gig I was performing at and had a funny turn (so to speak). My health deteriorated sharply after that but I powered on.\n\nI applied for special consideration for the exams but didn't have a diagnosis to share at that point, just the vagaries of being very unwell and a medical certificate from a local pharmacist in lieu of my fully booked GP.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nIn the dark as much as I was, the medical school rejected my application.\n\nDespite this, I passed my exams but then ended up in hospital, pale and exhausted, where we finally got to the bottom of things. A benign but nasty tumour had been lurking at the base of my brain and wreaking health havoc for the preceding year or two.\n\nIt turned out that funny turn was the tumour bleeding into my skull.\n\nI made it through exams but wound up in hospital where they found the cause of my \"funny turn\" and subsequent health issues. (Supplied: Roland Bull)\n\n\"You deserve the university medal for getting through exams with all this going on,\" said one of my new specialists a few weeks later.\n\nI wore the statement like a badge of honour for months.\n\nI felt preternaturally resilient: if I could get through medical school in the midst of a health crisis then surely, I could do anything.\n\nAll those thoughts of being less energetic and capable than my younger peers morphed into pride at being able to handle so much more than the average person.\n\nNonetheless, I postponed my internship for three months to get back on my feet.\n\nThe reprieve wasn't all smooth sailing as I packed up my house in Canberra, moved in with family in Queensland, got settled and then braced for Cyclone Alfred. But I was itching to commence life as a junior doctor so ignored my sub-optimal recovery and launched into work in April this year.\n\nHuman after all\n\nI lasted two shifts then totally crashed, physically and mentally.\n\nTail between my legs, I had to admit I was human after all.\n\nIn fact, valuing resilience over adequate self-care had been a trap that set me back a few steps on the path to recovery.\n\nWhile completing medical school that unwell was a notable achievement, it was also incredibly stupid. I'd navigated a dangerous health event in survival mode, but I couldn't live the rest of my life that way.\n\nWhy I turned down my dream job Photo shows Phoebe Thorburn stands behind a wooden kitchen bench with their hands on the benchtop, looking happy. Phoebe was offered a role that was perfect on paper, but the reality of what it entailed made them rethink what a \"dream job\" looks like.\n\nOf course, that didn't stop me from feeling like an absolute failure for having to pause internship again so soon.\n\nHappily, the extra time off gave room for some quiet contemplation. I can't help but think that, while it takes a lot of resilience to navigate a personal crisis, it takes even more to safeguard your health in a society that values testing your limits in pursuit of productivity.\n\nClearly, I still view self-care as indulgence, even though I bang on about it at every opportunity. But taking the time to be healthy and well before delving into something stressful is invaluable. I wish I'd done that rather than rushing into work before I was ready.\n\nWatch the new season of The Assembly on ABC iview Photo shows A young person holding a microphone standing amongst audience. Leigh Sales returns to mentor a new cohort of autistic journalism students from across the country as they interview some of Australia's favourite celebrities.\n\nGiving yourself permission to step back and breathe or to tread a different timeline to the people around you can prompt all kinds of apprehension, embarrassment and shame. I still feel each of those things from time to time as I carve out the necessary space to balance work and health.\n\nI'm also still itching to progress my medical career, just as long as I'm well enough and have a plan in place to stay that way.\n\nBeing cognisant of my own wellbeing will make me a better doctor and make things safer for my patients.\n\nBecause first do no harm begins with self-care and all that.\n\nRoland Bull is a freelance writer, comedian and doctor.",

    "text": "Five years after being slashed to historical lows as a pandemic cost-of-living measure, deeming rates have increased again.\n\nDeeming is part of the income test for Centrelink payments, and the rate affects how much a recipient's income from assets reduces their fortnightly payments.\n\nPensioners are the largest group affected by changes to deeming rates \u2014 meaning some retirees may see a decrease in their next pension payment.\n\nLet's unpack what the new changes mean.\n\nWhen did the changes happen?\n\nThe new deeming rates came into effect on Saturday, alongside the indexation of other Centrelink payments, including the age pension.\n\nSo recipients should see the changes in their next payment.\n\nThe federal government announced these changes back in August.\n\nWhat is deeming?\n\nDeeming is a set of rules the government uses to work out how much income people earn from their financial assets \u2014 things like shares, superannuation, and bank accounts.\n\nIt assumes people receive a set income from the interest on those investments, whether they actually get that much or not.\n\nBut here's the kicker: if your investment return is higher than the deemed rate, the government doesn't count that extra money as part of your income.\n\nThat means anything you earn above that rate isn't counted in the income test for the age pension.\n\nAnd this means the lower the deeming rate, the more people can earn from their investments without it affecting their pension payments.\n\nSo if you're an age pensioner \u2014 or a recipient of another payment \u2014 earning income from financial assets, you benefit from a lower deeming rate.\n\nWhat are the new deeming rates?\n\nAs of Saturday, deeming rates increased by 0.5 percentage points to:\n\nThe lower deeming rate: 0.75 per cent\n\n0.75 per cent The upper deeming rate: 2.75 per cent\n\nThat's after five years of the lower rate being 0.25 per cent and the upper rate being 2.25 per cent.\n\nThe rates were slashed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way of helping retirees during the economic crisis \u2014 before that, the lower rate was 1 per cent and the higher rate was 3 per cent.\n\nWho is affected by this?\n\nAnyone on an income support payment who earns income from financial assets.\n\nBut the main group of people affected will be retirees who receive part-pension payments.\n\n\"Age pensioners comprise around 60 per cent of the recipients affected by deeming and tend to experience the largest impact from deeming on their payment rates,\" the Department of Social Services said in a draft impact analysis paper.\n\n\"This is because age pensioners tend to hold more financial assets than people receiving other income support payments.\n\n\"There are several reasons for this, including that people of age pension age have had longer to accumulate financial assets, and their superannuation balances are assessable.\"\n\nHow will it impact pensioners?\n\nNearly 70,000 pensioners will see a drop in their fortnightly payments, according to Department of Social Services estimates in the draft impact analysis.\n\nBut this is speaking quite broadly, so keep in mind that individual circumstances will change the impact.\n\nHere's the example Services Australia gives on its deeming website for pensioners:\n\nIf you're a single age pensioner: The first $64,200 of your financial assets has the deemed rate of 0.75 per cent applied. Everything over that is deemed to earn 2.75 per cent interest.\n\nThe first $64,200 of your financial assets has the deemed rate of 0.75 per cent applied. Everything over that is deemed to earn 2.75 per cent interest. If you're in a couple and at least one of you receives the age pension: The first $106,200 of your combined financial assets has the deemed rate of 0.75 per cent applied. Everything over that is deemed to earn 2.75 per cent.\n\nThere are currently more than 2.6 million people on the age pension, with 457,300 affected by deeming at the previous rate.\n\nBut the Department of Social Services estimated only 69,500 of those age pensioners will see a decrease in their payments.\n\nThat's because it's being applied at the same time as regular indexation of welfare support like the age pension, and increased payments.\n\nThe analysis said the median decrease was an estimated $6.70 a fortnight.\n\nKeep in mind that's the median, which is the number that falls exactly in the middle of an ordered data set and is generally used instead of a more common measure for averages called the mean, when higher incomes can skew the data.\n\nSo from that estimated median, we can deduce that, of the affected pensioners, half may see their payments go down by less than $6.70, while the other half may see their payments decrease by more than $6.70.\n\nHowever, this is all according to the department's draft impact analysis, which wasn't finalised or assessed by the federal Office of Impact Analysis before the government announced the changes in August.\n\nWill deeming rates go up again?\n\nPotentially.\n\nAt the moment, they're still 0.25 percentage points lower than they were before the pandemic.\n\n\"The Australian Government Actuary will take on the role of recommending future deeming rates,\" a Department of Social Services press release said in August.\n\n\"They will advise government on the most appropriate rate, guided by the returns that pensioners and other payment recipients can reasonably access on their investments.\n\n\"The government will retain the power to make adjustments, including during exceptional circumstances or events.\"\n\nAny future increases will be timed to coincide with indexation of payments, which the department says may cancel out some of the impacts of deeming rate increases on pensioners.",

    "text": "A review into how a live electrical cable came down on top of a Sydney train plunging the network into chaos for more than 24 hours has found the overhead wire had been identified as a risk years earlier.\n\nIn May, the power connection device on a train between Strathfield and Homebush collided with overhead wires, bringing down a 1,500-volt electrical cable on the carriage.\n\nThe system failure at this critical junction for the rail network meant power to the six tracks between Strathfield and Homebush had to be isolated.\n\nThree hundred passengers from the train were quickly escorted out of the carriages by Sydney Trains response teams.\n\nCommuters who were on at least two other trains on other lines also had to be escorted off due to the power isolation \u2014 the whole process of detraining passengers taking three hours.\n\nPassengers were evacuated from the train onto the tracks after the incident in May. (ABC News)\n\nThe incident prompted a meltdown across multiple lines for the afternoon peak hour, with parts of the city's network grounding to a halt.\n\nBy the next morning, rail workers were repairing the overhead wires on the defective train before the power could be switched back on.\n\nBut the damage to commuters' trust and time had been done, amid reduced service frequencies and limited communication about running services.\n\nFollowing the incident commuters faced empty departure boards and little access to information. (ABC News: Jack Ailwood)\n\n'No defensible reason' for lengthy recovery\n\nThe Independent Rail Review, released on Tuesday, found the overhead wire that failed had been identified as a risk in 2020 but was never entered into Sydney Trains' defect management system and not repaired.\n\nTransport Minister John Graham said testing of the wire years ago had shown it was below the condemning level \u2014 a point of wear that determines when a wire must be replaced.\n\nThe visual inspectors who examine these wires rely on binoculars, meaning they cannot get close enough for an adequate view.\n\nThe fallen overhead wire caused massive disruption across the Sydney train network. (Supplied: NSW Government)\n\nThe review, commissioned by NSW Premier Chris Minns, found staff were provided with \"insufficient\" tools and lacked management capability to identify and deal with such an issue.\n\nThere was also \"no defensible reason\" why de-training passengers at Homebush was prolonged and that the time between the incident and the recovery was \"far too long\".\n\n\"In this incident the leadership did not appear to be confident, strong or disciplined and the teams were not deployed by that leader as we would have expected,\" the review said. \"Part of the issue was a lack of qualifications in the operation of the railway and the safety procedures and rules that accompany that operation.\"\n\nPassengers were left facing network chaos after the incident. (ABC News)\n\nThe review said another concern was the lack of communication on the day \u2014 to passengers stuck on the train, the commuters expecting to catch a train home and the broader public.\n\n\"The government received some limited communication from Sydney Trains but not in detail and not reliable,\" it said.\n\nSystemic issues addressed in report\n\nBeyond the May wire cable incident, the review highlighted the need for Sydney Trains to embrace advanced technology, such as cameras for assessing the condition of the network.\n\nOne of the recommendations was for Sydney Trains to determine whether artificial intelligence could assist in reviewing footage captured by cameras \u2014 such as identifying anomalies.\n\nMore than $450 million in funding is set to be spent on the railway network over the next four years. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nWhen the review's authors visited the Rail Operation Centre (ROC) \u2014 which manages the day-to-day running of the network \u2014 they said it was \"noisy, crowded and there was a small degree of tension\".\n\nThey recommended the physical layout of the centre and the amount of people on the floor be adjusted to make for a more \"efficient\" environment.\n\nFollowing a separate review into Sydney Trains in 2023, the Rail Repair Plan (RRP) was enacted and saw an immediate infrastructure \"maintenance blitz\" to reduce backlogs to sustainable levels.\n\nIn Tuesday's review, the success of the RRP was addressed and said the improvement in infrastructure performance had \"not been sustained since the completion of the RRP in June 2024\".\n\n'Not up to scratch', says transport minister\n\nMr Graham said the state government accepted all 12 recommendations made by the review into Sydney Trains.\n\n\"The people of Sydney expect a safe and reliable rail network \u2014 and right now, it's not up to scratch,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\" A well-managed rail maintenance program could \u2014 and should \u2014 have fixed this fault after it was detected and prevented the disruption affecting so many. \"\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Graham described the review as a \"blunt assessment\".\n\nJohn Graham said the state government accepted all 12 recommendations made by the review. (ABC News: Liam Patrick)\n\nOne of the report's panellists Kerry Schott said she was \"very pleased\" to see the network issues determined by the review being addressed.\n\n\"It carries over a million people every working day, so the fact that it must run properly is not a trivial one,\" she said.\n\nMr Graham said an investment of $458.4 million would be made over four years to bolster the network.\n\nIn the wake of the incident in May, Transport for NSW coordinator general of Howard Collins said it was rare for a \"catastrophic event\" like this to have occurred, describing the voltage of the fallen overhead wires as \"life-threatening\".\n\nAt the time, Mr Collins said officials did not believe a \"lack of maintenance\" had anything to do with the issue.",

(ABC News: Nathan Coates)\n\nHowever, the prison guard estimated the prison population was expected to reach close to 900 when the women's centre opened.\n\nIn the summer of 2024-25, Alice Springs recorded 100 days over 40 degrees Celsius, with the hottest March day ever recorded when the mercury tipped 44.5C.\n\nInhumane conditions\n\nThe correctional officer said they had recorded temperatures as high as 34 degrees in the cells, which was a \"contributing factor\" to unrest.\n\n\"If you stand up with the beds and all their property \u2026 they can move around but not much,\" they said.\n\nThey said the conditions were inhumane and were surprised that \"there haven't been more serious injuries\".\n\n\"When our staff is below a certain number, there's operational things that we have to do, ultimately leading to blocks being locked down for the day,\" they said.\n\nHowever, officers try to give prisoners several hours out of cell each day when in lockdown.\n\n\"But an hour or two in 24 hours is not much,\" they said.\n\nAdds pressure\n\nWhen it heats up, they said the prisoners \"get a little bit agitated and it certainly adds to that pressure\".\n\n\"And then obviously the pressure of not being able to move around and being stuck inside the dorm turns into stress.\n\n\"How they vent that stress depends on the individual or what's going on in the environment.\"\n\nThe officer said that prison itself was not the punishment and was supposedly a place of rehabilitation.\n\n\"The judge punishes the prisoners by sentencing them to the time spent at the prison,\" they said.\n\n\"The prison is supposed to be where you serve your time, you get rehabilitated to come back into society and then contribute positively, hopefully.\n\n\"But the sheer number of prisoners we have, the lack of staff we have, the lack of resources that we have available to us mean that you just can't do that.\"\n\nOutreach services condemn conditions\n\nA group of churches that take turns to hold weekly Sunday services at the prison said it had written letters about the inhumane conditions.\n\nIn March, ministers from the Uniting, Anglican, Desert Life and Baptist churches wrote to local CLP member for Braitling, Josh Burgoyne, outlining their grave concerns at the lack of cooling and ventilation at the Alice Springs Correctional Centre.\n\nHowever, Mr Burgoyne said he did not receive the letter.\n\nSpokesperson for the group, Anglican Reverend Kristan Slack, said they wrote the letter after last summer's heatwave when the prisoners were subjected to extreme conditions.\n\n\"We know that heat kills,\" he said.\n\nReverend Slack described the CLP's position that the heat should be a part of the prisoners' punishment as \"inhumane\".\n\nReverend Emily Hayes and Reverend Kristan Slack condemn the conditions at the Alice Springs prison. (ABC News: Will Green)\n\n\"I think every human being made in God's image deserves to be treated with kindness and dignity, no matter what they've done,\" he said.\n\n\" I think it's just an abrogation of responsibilities our government has to care for all people. \"\n\nReverend Slack said that there was a dangerous situation brewing and the NT government needed to act as a matter of urgency.\n\n\"I'm concerned if it's like the last [summer], it's no surprise that people get upset, angry, irritable when they can't see any change to their living conditions,\" he said.\n\nThe consortium of churches met with Mr Burgoyne on Friday and said while he was receptive to their concerns that no commitments were made at the meeting to improve the situation.\n\nPrisoners not a priority\n\nMr Burgoyne said upgrades across NT prisons would cost millions of dollars that would need to come from other portfolios.\n\nJosh Burgoyne says the government's priority is to keep the community safe. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\n\"You can tell me right now which schools you'd like me to take the $20 million off, which police you'd like us to get rid of so that we can fund the $20 million for the prisoners,\" he said.\n\nWhile the previous Labor government was investigating cooling solutions, the CLP has ruled it out.\n\nMr Burgoyne said jail was a punishment.\n\n\"If you commit an offence, if you beat your wife, if you do the wrong thing, you will end up in jail,\" he said.\n\n\"We will find a bed for you, and we will ensure that the community is safe. That's our government's number one priority.\"\n\nMr Burgoyne said the government would \"work with all the agencies to ensure that we're getting better outcomes as we move forward\".",

Liverpool's Mohamed Salah finished fourth and did not attend the ceremony.\n\n\"What I have just experienced is exceptional, I have no words for it, what happened with PSG. I feel a bit of stress, it's not easy to win this trophy, and to have it presented to me by Ronaldinho, a legend of football, is exceptional,\" Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 said on stage at a Paris ceremony where he was supported by several teammates, the others being in Marseille for the Ligue 1 clash against OM which they lost 1-0.\n\n\"I want to thank PSG, who came to get me in 2023. It's an incredible family. The president, Nasser (Al-Khelaifi) is like a father to me. I also want to thank all the staff and the coach, who have been exceptional with me \u2014 he too is like a father \u2014 and all my teammates.\n\n\"We have practically won everything together. You supported me in the good and the difficult times. This individual trophy is one the team has won collectively,\" he added, later bursting into tears when he thanked his mother, who joined him on stage.\n\nHe also mentioned his first club, Stade Rennais, and the national team, vowing to win another World Cup next year with coach Didier Deschamps after their 2018 victory.\n\nDemb\u00e9l\u00e9's prize was one of several for PSG, who won the treble of Champions League, Ligue 1 and the French Cup last season as well as the UEFA Super Cup this year.\n\nAitana Bonmat\u00ed took home the Women's Ballon d'Or for the third consecutive year, putting her in rare air. (AP Photo: Thibault Camus)\n\nThe French champions were named team of the season, Luis Enrique was voted best coach and Gianluigi Donnarumma, who left for Manchester City in the close season, was recognised as top goalkeeper with the Yashin trophy.\n\n\"It's the result of hard work, by everyone at the club,\" PSG president Al-Khelaifi said. \"We've got young players, and stars who work for the team. It's a collective achievement.\"\n\nSpain's Bonmat\u00ed, the Champions League player of the season, won the women's Ballon d'Or for the third time in a row.\n\nBonmat\u00ed won ahead of her Spain teammate Mariona Caldentey.\n\nShe is only the third player in the award's history to win three in a row after Michel Platini (1983\u201385) and Lionel Messi (2009\u201312).\n\n\"Third time in a row here and I still can't believe it,\" Bonmat\u00ed said.\n\n\"I owe Barcelona everything, this is the club of my life.\"\n\nShe won a domestic treble with Barcelona and also reached the Champions League final.\n\nBarcelona has won the last five women's awards but it was expected an Englishwoman would win for the first time.\n\nEngland won the Euros and Arsenal took the Women's Champions League. But with five England players among the women's top 10 nominees, the highest-placed was Alessia Russo at third.\n\nAustralia's Steph Catley was also shortlisted for the award, finishing 29th in the voting.\n\nCatley was named the fourth-highest-rated defender in the women's game.\n\nWhile she did not take home individual spoils, Catley made the stage at the Ballon d'Or ceremony after her Arsenal side was named the women's team of the year.\n\nBarcelona forward Vicky Lopez won the women's Kopa trophy and Sarina Wiegman, who led England to European victory, took the Johan Cruyff award for best women's coach.\n\nThe men's and women's Gerd M\u00fcller trophies for the top scorers went to Barcelona's Ewa Pajor and Viktor Gyokeres, who joined Arsenal this summer from Sporting Portugal after a prolific season.\n\nReuters/AP",

We need to invest more in our ambulances and our emergency services because they are so underfunded, understaffed, overworked,\" she said.\n\nMs Davis said seeing her daughter in pain for hours had been a terrifying ordeal.\n\n\"I just didn't know what she had done; the only thing we had worked out was you could see her kneecap was on the floor \u2026 it had moved so much it was on laying on the floor,\" she said.\n\nMonique Dries's dislocated knee was eventually treated at Royal Darwin Hospital.

    "text": "Nvidia says it will invest up to $US100 ($152) billion in OpenAI and supply it with data center chips, the companies said on Monday, marking a tie-up between two of the highest-profile players in the global artificial intelligence race.\n\nThe move underscores the increasingly overlapping interests of the various tech giants developing advanced AI systems. The deal gives chipmaker Nvidia a financial stake in the world's most prominent AI company, which is already an important customer.\n\nAt the same time, the investment gives OpenAI the cash and access it needs to buy advanced chips that are key to maintaining its dominance in an increasingly competitive landscape. Rivals of both companies may be concerned the partnership will undermine competition.\n\nThe deal will involve two separate but intertwined transactions, according to a person close to OpenAI. Nvidia will start investing in OpenAI for non-voting shares once the deal is finalized, then OpenAI can use the cash to buy Nvidia\u2019s chips, the person said.\n\n\"Everything starts with compute,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. \"Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.\"\n\nThe two companies signed a letter of intent to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI and said they aimed to finalize partnership details in the coming weeks. The power for those chips is equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million US households.\n\nUnder the new deal, once the two sides reach a definitive agreement for OpenAI to purchase Nvidia systems, Nvidia will invest an initial $US10 billion, the person familiar with the matter said. OpenAI was most recently valued at $US500 billion.\n\nNvidia will start delivering hardware as soon as late 2026, with the first gigawatt of computing power to be deployed in the second half of that year on its upcoming platform, named Vera Rubin.\n\nWith Reuters",

    "text": "The agency that regulates medicines in Australia says paracetamol is considered safe for use in pregnancy, despite Donald Trump saying it increases the risk of autism in babies.\n\nMr Trump said that he believed pregnant women should \"strongly\" limit the use of paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, unless they had an \"extremely high fever\" that they could not \"tough out\".\n\n\"Pregnant women should talk to their doctors,\" Mr Trump said.\n\n\"Ideally, you don't take it at all.\"\n\nRFK Jr replaces vaccine advisory panel with anti-vaxxers Photo shows Robert F Kennedy Jr speaks from behind a lectern while wearing a navy blue suit US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr says his new appointments are not anti-vaxxers and the move is necessary \"to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science.\"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates medicines in the US, will issue a physician's notice about the potential risks of taking paracetamol during pregnancy and begin the process of initiating a safety label change on the medication, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said.\n\nBut the Australian regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), along with the Australian Medical Association (AMA), the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and their American counterpart, have all reaffirmed the safety and benefits of paracetamol in pregnancy.\n\n\"Paracetamol remains Pregnancy Category A in Australia, meaning that it is considered safe for use in pregnancy,\" the TGA said in a statement.\n\n\"The TGA has no current active safety investigations for paracetamol and autism, or paracetamol and neurodevelopmental disorders more broadly.\"\n\nAMA president Dr Danielle McMullen told ABC News Breakfast that regulators considered paracetamol safe to use during pregnancy.\n\n\"Of course, like all medications, we try to use as little as possible when pregnant, but certainly for pain and fever in pregnancy, the advice here in Australia still is that paracetamol is still a reasonable and safe option for pregnant women to use,\" she said.\n\nDr Danielle McMullen says Australian regulators consider paracetamol safe to use during pregnancy. (Supplied)\n\nDr Norman Swan, host of the ABC's Health Report, said pregnant women were taking paracetamol for a reason.\n\n\"Fever in pregnancy is not good for the unborn child and you want to prevent fever, hence influenza immunisation, hence COVID immunisation,\" he said.\n\n\"You want to minimise the chances a woman will get infected with a virus.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"If you do get a fever, paracetamol is what will get rid of it.\"\n\nHe added, \"you shouldn't be taking any drug in pregnancy unless you need it\".\n\n\"But, if you need it, take it: you need to be more worried about the fever than the paracetamol,\" he said.\n\nAssociation does not mean causation\n\nAndrew Whitehouse, professor of autism research at the Kids Research Institute Australia and a director of Autism Awareness Australia, said there had been several studies exploring whether taking acetaminophen (also called paracetamol) during pregnancy could increase the likelihood of the offspring of the pregnancy being diagnosed with autism.\n\n\"Some studies have reported small associations, but these findings are not consistent and do not prove that acetaminophen directly causes autism,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Autism is a complex condition influenced by many genetic and environmental factors.\n\n\"Any small associations in this area need to be weighed against the risk of untreated high fever in pregnancy for the woman and the developing baby.\"\n\nNeurodivergent students exit mainstream schools Photo shows a teenage boy looks at the camera wearing a cap and headphone. His mum stands at his side smiling at him lovingly. Special assistance schools are experiencing growing demand as traditional classrooms fall short of meeting the needs of neurodivergent students.\n\nA study in Sweden that analysed data from 2.48 million births found that when researchers compared siblings (a method to control for genetic and environmental factors), any apparent links between acetaminophen and autism disappeared.\n\nDr Hannah Kirk, a National Health and Medical Research Council fellow at Monash University, said suggestions that paracetamol (commonly sold in the US as Tylenol) use during pregnancy could increase the risk of autism had, understandably, raised concern among expectant parents.\n\n\"Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition with no known single cause, however, research shows that genetics play a large role, with hundreds of genes being linked to autism,\" she said.\n\n\"No study has shown that acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol, causes autism.\n\n\"Some studies have reported an association between acetaminophen use and autism, while others have not.\n\n\"Importantly, association does not mean causation.\"\n\nWatch the new season of The Assembly on ABC iview Photo shows A young person holding a microphone standing amongst audience. Leigh Sales returns to mentor a new cohort of autistic journalism students from across the country as they interview some of Australia's favourite celebrities.\n\nProfessor Scott White from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists described the stance from the White House as \"surprising\", in terms of the science.\n\n\"Having a fever early in pregnancy can be associated with all sorts of adverse pregnancy outcomes other than just autism,\" Professor White said.\n\n\"I would quite confidently use paracetamol in pregnancy and statements like 'pregnant women should just tough it out, if they have a fever,' contribute to what we see about limiting use of medications that are clearly safe for pregnant women.\"",

    "text": "If the most memorable moment out of your code's \"night of nights\" doesn't even involve the winner, you've got a problem.\n\nThis is where the AFL is at with the Brownlow Medal after another bizarre count led to more questions about the voting process and whether the umpires should still be in charge of deciding who wins the award.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe moment in question arrived towards the back end of what was at that point an exciting count as the eventual Brownlow Medal winner, Matt Rowell, held off his closest challenger, Nick Daicos.\n\nWhen Round 20 arrived, AFL CEO Andrew Dillon \u2014 who reads the votes from each game \u2014 had increased his already breakneck reading speed, particularly for games not involving contenders like Rowell and Daicos.\n\nDillon was buzzing through the St Kilda \u2013 Melbourne game, better known as the Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera game, when he read out the words that might alter the future of what has always been considered the most prestigious award an AFL player can win: \"St Kilda, N Wanganeen-Milera, two votes.\"\n\nThe reaction from around the room said it all.\n\nPlayers are so used to keeping their poker face on during events like this, but Wanganeen-Milera couldn't help himself, cartoonishly popping his eyes out in disbelief.\n\nHis teammate and St Kilda captain Jack Steele's hands said what his words couldn't at that point.\n\nOver at the Melbourne table, the Demons burst out into laughter after veteran Demons midfielder Jack Viney, he of 23 disposals and 16 tackles, took home the three votes.\n\nFor context, Wanganeen-Milera finished that game with 34 disposals and four goals, and ended the game doing this.\n\nWanganeen-Milera's game was so prolific that it was almost instantly regarded as the best individual game of the season and perhaps of this generation. It was so good that Simon Goodwin referenced it in his farewell press conference when he was sacked as Melbourne's coach just a few weeks later.\n\nThe AFL, like its rival sporting codes around the world, stays alive long after the final goal of the season is kicked due to legacy conversations between fans in every corner of Australia.\n\nNo matter what the sport is, these conversations all go the same way.\n\nHow many premierships have they won? How many All-Australian jackets? How many Norm Smiths? At some point in the conversation comes the inevitable question: How many Brownlows?\n\nMoments like the Nasiah game might alter how these conversations go from now on, because it is clear the Brownlow has lost some of its lustre.\n\nCan we still use the Brownlow as a means by which to decide where players sit on the all-time pyramid? Perhaps not.\n\nIt has long been decided that this is an award that only midfielders can win despite some of the game's most valuable players being those that play in key positions.\n\nMidfielders seemingly having a monopoly on the Brownlow has led to hilariously bloated vote totals in recent years.\n\nLast year, Carlton skipper Patrick Cripps smashed the record by polling 45 votes.\n\nNick Daicos has now polled 98 votes in the previous three seasons but has not come close to winning the Brownlow Medal. (Getty Images: Michael Willson)\n\nThis year's runner-up, Daicos, has now polled 98 votes in the last three years without really coming close to ever winning the Brownlow.\n\nDaicos's average of 33 votes over the last three seasons would have won him the Brownlow in all but six seasons under the 3-2-1 voting system.\n\nNoise about whether the voting should be taken off the AFL's umpires isn't new, but will feel as intense as ever at league headquarters following the reaction to Wanganeen-Milera's two-vote game.\n\nIn yesteryear, the umpires were permitted to have stat sheets to assist them when deciding which players to award votes to. That is no longer allowed due to integrity concerns surrounding the award following a controversial betting scandal involving a former umpire.\n\nFans genuinely considered whether umpires had gotten Gold Coast stars Noah Anderson and Matt Rowell confused, such was the bizarre nature of votes awarded in certain Suns games. (Getty Images: Michael Willson)\n\nIf stat sheets were available to aid the umpires, it is very likely Rowell would not have taken home the Brownlow this year.\n\nOn three separate occasions in the early part of the count, the Suns midfielder took home three votes in games where he didn't poll a single coaches vote.\n\nIt is proof that the disparity between how the umpires see the game and how the coaches see the game has never been greater.\n\nThe voting involving Suns games was so confusing at stages that fans on social media genuinely wondered whether umpires had gotten Rowell and fellow Suns midfield dynamo Noah Anderson confused.\n\nIt was something that Rowell himself couldn't help but allude to in his victory speech, as he paid tribute to the impact his best friend, Anderson, has had on his career.\n\n\"I think I might've pinched a few votes off him that he should've got,\" Rowell said.\n\nThe sad part of the voting controversy is that it takes away from what is undoubtedly the highlight of Rowell's young career.\n\nThe AFL has been waiting on Rowell and the Suns for a few years, but this is further confirmation that both have well and truly arrived.\n\nThe way in which Rowell's victorious count began was similar to how he arrived in the AFL after being taken first overall in the 2019 draft by a floundering Suns side.\n\nRowell was touted as a future Brownlow winner just a month into his AFL career before a shoulder injury at Kardinia Park dragged his career to a screeching halt.\n\nRowell was awarded the Brownlow Medal after a career-best season that saw him average 26.3 disposals, 8.6 tackles and 8.2 clearances per game. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nThe votes at the end of that season showed he'd polled three votes in his second, third and fourth career games, something unseen in a first-year player.\n\nThis year he went one better, becoming the first player in league history to poll three votes in each of his first four games.\n\nAfter Daicos came into the night as the raging hot favourite, this was the first sign that the night wouldn't go to plan for the Collingwood superstar.\n\nThe voting drama shouldn't take away from what a wonderful footballer Rowell has become, as many predicted five years ago.\n\nBrownlow Medal red carpet: All the best fashion from AFL's night of nights Photo shows Arlette Jones and Nick Daicos of the Collingwood Magpies. See which players and partners' looks turned heads during the red carpet arrivals ahead of the 2025 Brownlow Medal ceremony.\n\nRowell took some time to recover from the shoulder injury in his debut season, but this year showcased all the traits that made him one of the most hyped top picks heading into the 2019 draft.\n\nHe is able to take a game by the scruff of the neck like very few midfielders in the competition can.\n\nYou want to stop him? You better have three or four midfielders willing to take on the gargantuan task of denying him when the ball is in the same postcode.\n\nThe scary part for the rest of the AFL is that Rowell only seems to be scratching the surface of how good and dominant he can really be.\n\nTo take home the Brownlow, you've got to have a few things go your way.\n\nYou need to be on a team that is decent enough to be in the top eight, unless you're an all-timer like Gary Ablett Jr.\n\nMatt Rowell polled 39 votes to win the Brownlow Medal ahead of Nick Daicos and Bailey Smith. (Getty Images: Morgan Hancock)\n\nYou need to stuff the stat sheet, but that alone isn't enough. The stats need to be impactful.\n\nThis is where Rowell thrives.\n\nWhen Rowell is having a good game, it is impossible not to feel it, even if you're just watching the Suns play on TV while sitting in your living room.\n\nEach possession feels impactful and deflates Rowell's opponents. It is how he is able to take home three votes in games where he's logged possession tallies in the mid-teens.\n\nIn previous generations, the Brownlow Medal was the crowning achievement for a player. It was a sign that you had arrived as one of the game's elites.\n\nRowell is one of those, his accolades outside of the Brownlow Medal suggest this.\n\nSadly, the medal that used to previously rubberstamp a player's arrival in the upper echelon of the game no longer carries the weight it once did.",

    "text": "Driving instructors in Western Australia could be forced to install cameras inside their vehicles in a bid to better protect vulnerable young students.\n\nAn ABC 7.30 investigation this month uncovered hundreds of allegations of young women being sexually harassed or assaulted by their driving instructors.\n\nMany of those cases come down to the student's word against the instructor's because no Australian jurisdiction currently requires instructors to have dash cams.\n\nSouth Australia is working towards requiring cameras and GPS tracking for all training vehicles, although the cameras have been opposed by some instructors.\n\nThe WA government is considering mandating the use of dash cameras inside driving instructors' cars. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nThe WA government has now announced it will soon consider whether to follow suit.\n\n\"Anyone undertaking a driving lesson should be able to do so safely,\" Assistant Transport Minister, Jessica Stojkovski, told the ABC in a statement.\n\n\"The Department of Transport and Major Infrastructure (DTMI) is preparing to review the Motor Vehicle Drivers Instructors Act 1963, including whether [camera surveillance units] should be made mandatory in these vehicles.\"\n\nCamera surveillance units are currently mandatory in taxis.\n\n'Benefits on both sides'\n\nMs Stojkovski said the review would consider a range of issues associated with the licensing of driving instructors under the 62-year-old law, but indicated she supported in-car cameras.\n\nJessica Stojkovski said the dash cameras would give parents and instructors peace of mind. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"I have a 15-year-old who's about to start doing driving lessons. I wouldn't have a problem with her driving with an instructor with a camera in the car,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it provides a level of comfort for parents.\n\n\"It actually provides a level of comfort for driving instructors too, or driving test [assessors] as well \u2026 so I think there are benefits on both sides.\"\n\nLack of clarity\n\nTodd Wecker has been teaching learner drivers and driving instructors for years and said he would \"love\" to install an inward-facing camera and had already looked into it.\n\n\"If there was a report or something come up, we can show this is what actually happened,\" he said.\n\nTodd Wecker said he supported the use of dash cameras for driving instructors. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\" So it gives security for myself, plus also for my student. \"\n\nBut he said current laws were too ambiguous.\n\n\"There's not enough clarity around where we stand in doing this as well, and you certainly don't want to cross any borders of privacy,\" Mr Wecker said.\n\nMr Wecker is concerned current laws are too ambiguous. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nHe also hoped the government's review would consider how to make existing complaint mechanisms more effective.\n\n\"It's more about getting the people to come forward and make that complaint to start with,\" he said.\n\nWhat the numbers show\n\nData released to the ABC showed only 113 complaints had been made to the Transport Department about driving instructors since 2021.\n\nMost were classed as practical driving assessment \"booking misuse\" (43 per cent), or \"unlicensed driving instructor\" (27 per cent).\n\nOnly one complaint of sexual assault was made, with five reports of sexual misconduct.\n\nThere have been 113 complaints made about WA driving instructors since 2021. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"Investigations into a driving instructor proceed based on the nature and seriousness of the complaint and the ability to take action,\" a department spokesperson said.\n\nOver that period, the department said it conducted 1,021 suitability reviews of driving instructors as part of new licence applications, reviews of existing licenses or following on from investigations.\n\n\"Reviews include medical fitness as well as assessment of whether a driving instructor is considered fit and proper,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAs a result of those reviews the department said five licenses were cancelled.\n\nCameras not a done deal\n\nWhile the review of driving instructor laws was first flagged as part of a road safety roundtable held in September 2024, there is no firm timeline for its completion.\n\n\"Work will commence on this review in the coming months, with the review to be completed once all relevant issues have been identified and addressed,\" a Transport Department spokesperson said.\n\nMs Stojkovski cautioned that just because ideas were put forward for review it did not mean they would be adopted.\n\nIt's not known when the review of the act will be completed. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"There are lots of sensible ideas that don't necessarily eventuate,\" she said.\n\n\"That's why we've included it, to test with the drivers and with the department and with parent groups, whether this is something that they'd be comfortable with and happy to see.\n\n\" I think it's an acknowledgement that ... we're living in a digital world, and those things are forming standard practice. \"\n\nMs Stojkovski added that while any reports of sexual assault or harassment should be referred to WA Police, the department did have a role to play.\n\nComplaints can be made on the department's website, by email, over the phone or in person.\n\nLoading...",

    "text": "The Murdochs made headlines when they settled their family battle recently, but you don\u2019t need to be a billionaire to have trouble with siblings. Money and inheritance can bring out tensions in the best of families, and those fights can be exhausting and destructive.\n\nAs Donal Griffin, Sydney estate lawyer at Legacy Law and trust family adviser, often reminds me, one of the big flashpoints is the discretionary family trust. They work well for a couple, but once the next generation comes along things get tricky. Imagine being told in your 50s that you now have to run a trust with your brothers and sisters \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise sparks fly.\n\nThe Murdochs made headlines when they settled their family battle recently, but you don\u2019t need to be a billionaire to have trouble with siblings. Credit: Marija Ercegovac\n\nThe Murdochs\u2019 Nevada hearing, details of which were leaked to the media, showed how courts apply a black-letter approach when interpreting trust deeds. These are often signed without much thought, then forgotten until a dispute erupts.\n\nIt\u2019s not unlike a shareholders\u2019 agreement, which is ignored while business runs on consensus \u2013 until suddenly, it doesn\u2019t. While parents control trusts without involving their children, later they\u2019re often horrified to discover their adult children may not run things the same way. As Griffin says, the transition is from a monarchy to a democracy \u2013 and there\u2019s usually a revolution along the way.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Virginia Tapscott looks every inch the tradwife. She\u2019s blonde, petite, and pretty. Her hair is loose and long; the sleeveless lavender top she\u2019s worn to lunch matches her phone case. Photos of her with her husband and four children on the farm are redolent of the tradwife aesthetic. There\u2019s no doubt I could, if I wanted to, paint her as one of the \u201ctraditional wives\u201d that have been amassing huge social media followings for embracing the role of wife and mother, turning their backs on career-feminist empowerment. But Tapscott doesn\u2019t fit neatly into that box. In the course of our discussion, I wonder if there\u2019s any box that will ever contain this woman in all her contradictions. On the day we meet at Pyrmont\u2019s Zebra Lounge, she\u2019s flown from rural Albury to meet me. She loves seafood, and eating it by the water is a rare treat. The outdoor dining area looks out over a playground, deserted in the rain. The absence of children serves to emphasise the irony that Tapscott, who has written extensively about her choice to stay home with her children, is not home with her children. I want badly to ask her about that. Tapscott has a \u201ctradwife\u201d vibe, but she\u2019s not easy to pigeonhole. We hurry to get the ordering out of the way \u2013 there\u2019s so much Tapscott wants to talk about that if we don\u2019t do it now, we\u2019ll never cover off everything before she has to fly home. She\u2019s quick to choose the seared yellowfin tuna with a black poppyseed crust, but hesitates over the wine choice. She\u2019s looking at a French chardonnay, which is $18 a glass. Definitely not Albury prices. \u201cThat\u2019s so expensive!\u201d she exclaims, settling instead on an Alsace pinot gris. Tapscott has written a book, which she\u2019s keen to promote. All Mothers Work confronts the notion that women who choose to care for their children full-time are embracing a regressive social hierarchy. It challenges society to properly recognise and honour care work, paid and unpaid. She sent me the manuscript after we met at a conference last year. In contrast to her strong prose, she has a country reserve about her. She often holds back in public debates out of excessive politeness, waiting till everyone else has had a chance to speak. Yet, there\u2019s a certainty about her that comes through even when she\u2019s silent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe book gropes towards a new kind of feminism. \u201cThe only liberation that was ever offered or envisaged for women was one where they could be less like themselves,\u201d she writes. \u201cMen and women came to believe that the only way to help women was to allow them to assimilate into a man\u2019s world.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to think what I was thinking about when I wrote that,\u201d she muses. But then it comes to her. \u201cI think we have a really tough conversation to have about internalised misogyny. So ultimately, this idea that women could only be empowered by being in the paid workforce or assuming masculine roles is misogynistic.\u201d Seared yellowfin tuna with a black poppyseed crust. Credit: Edwina Pickles This is not the feminism of our times which, according to Tapscott, only supports unpaid caregivers by getting them out of unpaid work. Tapscott calls it \u201ccareer feminism in a care cloak\u201d. I need to know how the 34-year-old has developed such unfashionable ideas. Tapscott thinks it\u2019s down to her upbringing. Virginia Tapp grew up in rural Narrabri. Her dad died before she was born; her widowed mother worked on a farm, driving trucks and tractors, and doing the books. The kids didn\u2019t go to childcare, but just tagged along with their mother. As a result, she says, \u201cI feel a bit outside of the culture sometimes. I feel like I\u2019m looking in on the way society is, and the way culture is a lot of the time. It enables me to be hypercritical of it.\u201d Her exposure to mainstream culture was mainly through the radio that was constantly on in the background. That led to her interest in becoming a journalist. Her first job was at the ABC, followed by a stint at The Courier in Narrabri.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she had her first child at 25, her son Oscar, she planned to put him into childcare to continue her career. \u201cI remember having this conversation with my husband. Like, he\u2019s one now, this is what people do; women go back to paid work now.\u201d But it didn\u2019t work out. Oscar was miserable; she was too. When the second baby came along, Tapscott and her husband decided she would give up formal work and freelance where she could. \u201cWe were lucky,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe lived in a shack that my husband built on my father-in-law\u2019s property. We lived in a rural area. I still drove my Toyota Corolla I\u2019d had since uni. Our costs were just quite low, and we were young.\u201d She acknowledges this isn\u2019t an option for many families struggling with the cost of housing. Because the universe loves contrasts, this is the moment when our luxurious plates of food arrive. Tapscott exclaims at the beautifully plated tuna, seared lightly on the outside and extremely rare. My food envy dissipates as soon as I taste my seafood pasta, which is stacked with prawns and mussels and finished in a velvety red bisque. Seafood pasta stacked with prawns. Credit: Edwina Pickles Before she even takes a bite, Tapscott has leaped into telling me that she began writing compulsively about what it was like being a mother after her son was born. Her articles seemed to resonate with readers, and it set her on the path she\u2019s on now, saying more and more of the unsaid. She seems to have completely forgotten her food. Thank goodness it doesn\u2019t need to be hot because she\u2019s back in full flight. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to have this conversation because it\u2019s really uncomfortable. If we admit that the systems we have in place aren\u2019t optimal, we\u2019re admitting that the whole underpinning of women\u2019s liberation is flawed.\u201d Now seems a good time to ask my question about Tapscott\u2019s central contradiction: much of her writing has been about motherhood, the tug women feel to spend more time with their babies, and the choice to take on the work of child-rearing rather than paid work. Yet here she is in Sydney, a one-and-a-half-hour flight and a world away from her children, gesticulating passionately about the book she\u2019s just written. What part of this is not traditional workforce participation?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the first time in a while, she becomes still again. \u201cI can identify cultural forces that devalue caregivers, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m immune to them,\u201d she says with a wry smile. \u201cI am also a product of a culture where my self-worth is derived from my paid contributions, which has been a constant struggle for me in motherhood. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have worked to try and raise cultural awareness of the value of caregiving, so that my daughters and sons can grow up in a society where they get validation, and they feel valuable in a caregiving role.\u201d She fires up again. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we attract policy mechanisms that support caregivers? Because,\u201d she answers her own question, \u201cdeep down, most of us haven\u2019t really learnt the true value of caring\u201d. Our conversation is taking place in the aftermath of shocking revelations of widespread sexual and physical abuse of children in childcare centres. Nicola Forrest\u2019s Minderoo Foundation \u2013 which is behind the Thrive By Five campaign for universal centre-based childcare \u2013 has found that one in 10 parents has withdrawn children from care and 16 per cent have reduced hours of care. Minderoo says this is indicative of \u201ca system in crisis\u201d. Tapscott sees it as vindication and has ramped up her advocacy for childcare to be valued by giving parents greater choice in how it\u2019s delivered. Parents are questioning their childcare options after the industry has been rocked by a series of scandals. Credit: Justin McManus She\u2019s spoken and written about the need for more support for women to stay longer with their babies and to use the childcare subsidy now only available to centre-based care for more flexible modes of care, like grandparents, or nannies. Many parents are getting behind a campaign she is associated with. Which means I now have to move the conversation onto delicate ground. As she has explored in a podcast, Tapscott and her older sister were sexually touched by their step-grandfather when they were little. Her abuse happened in a home setting as she was being cared for by relatives. How does she square that with calling for more in-home care? Is home really better than a well-regulated childcare setting?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer tone drops and she hesitates. But she has obviously thought this through. Her answer is fluent and confident. \u201cPeople who say you can\u2019t support care in the homes because they\u2019re unregulated, and child sexual abuse occurs there are missing the point entirely in terms of primary prevention,\u201d she says. As a child sexual abuse survivor, she believes that the answer is to encourage people who\u2019ve experienced abuse to speak out, so offenders can\u2019t hide behind secrecy. \u201cAlso,\u201d she concludes, \u201cit\u2019s a ridiculous notion that any unregulated space is now not appropriate\u201d. That sounds like a vaguely libertarian idea. I want to know where she sees herself on the political spectrum because I for the life of me can\u2019t figure it out. On the one hand, her family advocacy and the whiff of trad-wifery might lead people to label her as right-leaning. But that\u2019s not borne out by her work. I\u2019ve scrawled a note against one passage in towards the end of her manuscript: \u201cCommunalist or communist?\u2033\u2063\n\n\u201cSo confused,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t really fit in anywhere.\u201d The bill. But then she confirms what I\u2019ve been wondering: \u201cI think my approach to early childhood is really quite influenced by socialism.\u201d Margin note triumphant. She goes on to explain: \u201cI think human capital is a public good, and we need to be investing in that. And individualism has really fallen down in the current macroeconomic environment that we have in Australia, where people can\u2019t and won\u2019t have more children because they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Somehow, despite talking non-stop, we\u2019ve finished our meals. I buy some time by ordering a coffee \u2013 she demures \u2013 and steer the conversation onto the unusual story of how her book has been published. \u201cThe only feasible way I could write it was if I had an advance because I just didn\u2019t really see myself being able to afford that much more free labour\u201d. So she crowdfunded the book. The All Mothers Work Kickstarter raised $33,000, covering childcare and printing costs. In the meantime, this advocate for the choice to stay home has started studying medicine. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI mean, health issues and my advocacy for caregivers, it\u2019s all connected. So many health issues, public health problems that arise from people not having time to care for themselves and for each other.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Newstead\u2019s Bar Monte shows how to do it right. Matt Shea September 23, 2025 Save You have reached your maximum number of saved items. Remove items from your saved list to add more. Save this article for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them anytime. Got it Share\n\nHow do you take a restaurant group from a tourist town to a city? It\u2019s not easy. There\u2019s a different style of diner, of course, and more competition. But also different produce, different suppliers, different landlords, different staff. Bar Monte opened in Newstead earlier this month. Markus Ravik Australian food and beverage is littered with stories of small-town stars who took on the big smoke and swiftly had their backsides handed to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you had to bet on anyone making it work, it\u2019s Arcade Agency, the hospitality \u201ccollective\u201d best known for Light Years, which originated in Byron Bay. And perhaps it already has, opening a Light Years in Perth in April; thus far, that restaurant has been a hit. Related Article 1930s Brisbane apartments transformed into stunning new restaurant Now comes Bar Monte in Brisbane. It\u2019s the second Bar Monte after the Gold Coast original, which opened in December. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s really convinced us to open in Brisbane was the impact Light Years has had in Perth,\u201d co-owner Lorenzo Toscani says. Bar Monte has transformed the old Allonda digs on Longland Street. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe vision with Light Years before I was with them was always to be in coastal towns \u2013 start in Byron Bay and then obviously move up to the Gold Coast, and then Noosa. And then right in the middle of COVID they came up with Newcastle, which was a big step-up in terms of capacity.\u201d This gradual approach has served Arcade Agency well, and it\u2019s taken place against the background of a food and beverage scene where \u2013 since the pandemic, in particular \u2013 the ties between the cities and the regions, between farmers and producers and the city eateries they serve, have become stronger and stronger. Bar Monte\u2019s menu is much the same as Miami, with clever twists on familiar classics. Markus Ravik \u201cWhen we opened on the Gold Coast we already had Brisbane in mind, as well,\u201d Toscani says. \u201cBrisbane is growing so fast at the moment, there will be the Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs an Italian who landed in Australia in 2012 and his first city was Brisbane, when I went back a couple of years ago, I really fell in love with how much it had changed. We saw the opportunity and wanted to be part of it.\u201d Vodka paccheri with nduja and stracciatella. Markus Ravik Bar Monte opened mid-September in the Longland Street tenancy previously occupied by Allonda. The bones of the place are the same, with the staircase to the right of the long bar that faces the entrance and laneway that runs between Longland and Wyatt streets. The fit-out by Studio Plenty is moodier and more intimate and playful than Allonda, with dark tiling and marble counters, timber panelling and clever feature lighting. The treatment is modern but nostalgic, and suits the restaurant\u2019s slightly hidden location.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYellow fin tuna with pineapple, green chilli, lemon and koji mayonnaise. Markus Ravik \u201c[Bar Monte] is \u2018neighbourhood Italian\u2019, so we wanted to make it look a little bit retro but with a trattoria feeling \u2013 that Italian feeling,\u201d Toscani says. The menu is similar to the Miami original, with engaging twists on familiar Italian items, particularly when it comes to snacks and entrees. Beef carpaccio with truffle mayo, fried capers, shallots, reggiano. Markus Ravik A burrata entree is spiked with nduja and cashew pesto, Ortiz anchovy toast is given a glow-up with smoked tomato butter, and there\u2019s a mortadella bun with pickled green chilli and limoncello aioli that\u2019s become a minor star at the Miami restaurant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pastas are all unctuous numbers that range from a cacio e pepe and prawn and chilli linguine, to mezze maniche served with pork sausage and Tuscan kale, and a vodka paccheri that tosses in nduja and is finished with a liberal dose of stracciatella. The restaurant retains the basic layout of Allonda before it but has been given a completely new look by designers Studio Plenty. Markus Ravik There\u2019s also a short menu of mains that spruces up classics such as bistecca, veal cotoletta, and a diavola chicken. For drinks, there\u2019s a fun, savoury-focused cocktail menu (caprese martini, celery margarita, that kind of thing) and a 100(ish)-bottle wine list compiled by award-winning sommelier Andrea Martinisi that focuses on Australian, Italian and French drops. The restaurant is tucked away on a small laneway just off Longland Street. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, if you\u2019re going to add to Brisbane\u2019s packed market of Italian restaurants, Bar Monte is a good way to do it. \u201cIn coastal towns there\u2019s a lot of competition, too, but because they get so busy during certain periods, especially during school holidays \u2013 you know you\u2019re going to be full no matter what,\u201d Toscani says. \u201cWith the city, you need to bring your right game.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Communications Minister. Anika Wells, is talking tough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have a right to be livid about what has happened here. Right now, our focus is getting to the bottom of what went wrong, before we determine what happens next, but Optus will be held to account. I will say it again for the people whose confidence must be shaken by late Friday afternoon: this is not good enough.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outage \u2013 resulting from a network upgrade and primarily impacting South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory \u2013 blocked more than 600 emergency calls over 13 hours, during which three people died.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo customers contacted the telco's call centre early on Thursday [[18 September]] to alert them to the triple-0 failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut A-C-M-A Chair, Nerida O'Loughlin, says they weren't notified of the details until it was resolved more than ten hours later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't until the Friday, and very late in the day before the press conference, when we were informed by the CEO that there was 624 calls in play and of the deaths. As part of our investigation we also need to look at just what information they need to provide to all of us when they can get it to us because it was just too late.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Australia's Premier, Peter Malinauskas, has told the ABC he was equally left in the dark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We understand that things go wrong. There are technical failures that occur from time to time. Governments themselves aren't immune from that. It's the way you handle them that often really matters, and at the very least, there's been a fundamental and, in many respects, an inexcusable failure of communications from Optus\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese similarly describing the triple-0 failure as completely unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to see the investigation take place. What we want is to ensure something like this shouldn't happen. Optus has obligations, as do other communications companies, and clearly they haven't fulfilled the obligations that they have.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA previous Optus outage in 2023 affected about 10 million people's phone and internet services, more than 2,100 of which were unable to make triple-0 calls.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe telco then failed to conduct 369 welfare checks on people who had tried to make an emergency call in that time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt prompted the then-Chief Executive to resign \u2013 cost the company over 12 million dollars in fines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile law does not allow for criminal charges, Ms O'Loughlin says Optus will again likely face significant financial penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ACMA's investigation will look at a number of matters, but firstly, the requirements and obligations under what's the fundamental piece of legislation: Emergency Call Services Determination. What that requires is that carriers have networks and facilities in place to provide emergency call services and that every person that goes to use emergency call services will be connected to an emergency call services centre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut independent analyst, Paul Budde, says these punitive measures may not be enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Optus is definitely getting a blow \u2013 their brand is damaged, their trust is damaged. But people don't have a lot of choice. They're on the system; they need communication. We also, as a country, need Optus. It's not that we say we can only deal with Telstra \u2013 that's not what we want to do. It is important that Optus get its act together, and if it happens again, we need to have a different system in place to cope with the problems we are seeing happening in social, economic and life-loss situations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens Senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, is now calling for independent oversight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For too long these big telco companies have relied on self-regulation rather than direct regulation, and it's not costing people's lives. This is one of the most basic essential services. Safety and access to the emergency service when you need them. Our communication devices are now essential ... How many more strikes does this company need?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Optus' current framework, Mr Budde says this incident may not be the last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It could well take Optus several years to fix the underlying problem \u2013 get rid of the underinvestment that took place in the network. In other words, we can't wait that long for that to happen. We have to start looking at an alternative for how we can ensure that the triple-0 system is working in Australia, and perhaps we should take it away from the telcos, create an independent organisation who manages this system \u2013 still of course using the Telstra, Optus and Vodafone infrastructure.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAs September kicks off, it's time for many in Australia to not just go on camping and attend the various floral festivals, but also clean up food storage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Food Safety Information Council is encouraging Australians to do a check on their pantries, fridges and freezers, and clean out those items that have long passed the expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the cleaning could be tricky, as people are often found to confuse two important labels on food, according to Lydia Buchtmann, the chief executive of the Food Safety Information Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's best to remember the difference between the Best Before and the Use By date, because we don't want to waste food unnecessarily. And essentially, they just mean what they say. Used by means you actually have to use that food by that day, the best before date is, as it says, just about quality. So it will taste better by that day, but you can still eat it after that day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Buchtmann says people can rotate their food, by putting the new products at the back of the fridge or pantry, and use the older items first.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut effective food storage isn't just about checking the expiration dates, as experts say it's also about how the food is preserved.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Rozita Vaskoska is CSIRO's Consumer Safety Spokesperson.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the packaging of the food also matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have a cereal, try to tip it in a container that is dedicated to cereal, rather than just keeping the original packaging in and any other external packaging that is removable. It's good to not bring (external package) inside the pantry, because it can bring the risk of moths as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, food-borne illnesses - also known as food poisoning - have caused significant health and economic concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report by Food Standards Australia New Zealand, in 2022, there were an estimate of 4.67 million cases of food poisoning in Australia each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also found unsafe food had caused over 47,000 hospitalisations and 39 deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nVincent Ho is an associate professor and Clinical Academic Gastroenterologist at the Western Sydney University.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there's what he calls a definite linkage between ineffective food storage and food poisoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Food, they need to be stored in a particular environment to minimise the growth of bacteria, because we know bacteria flourish in a zone of temperature between 5 degrees and 60 degrees Celsius, that's called the danger zone. And that's when we get a lot of bacteria reproduction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the persistent issue, in 2024, Food Standards Australia New Zealand found less than half of its over 2000 respondents said they always followed proper procedures when preparing food at home, such as washing hands, and keeping the cutting boards and knives for raw meats separate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Australia is expected to be much hotter than average in the next few months, Professor Ho says it means people need to pay extra attention to the temperature their food is exposed to.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the heat can also make human bodies more vulnerable to food poisoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you take away from the heat stroke, which can affect people, what we know is that when you have warm environments, certainly people are more likely to be more susceptible to gastroenteritis. We know that across the world, from all the data, that typically, in very very hot conditions, people are more likely to get gastroenteritis in general.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how should we clean the fridge properly?\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Ho says it's important to regularly take out all the food as well as the draws and shelves for a deep clean session.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Adelaide mother Simone Porcaro is lucky she was with her young daughter when the unthinkable happened last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer husband was \"in and out of consciousness\" at home, and her calls to emergency services weren't going through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, my husband needed an ambulance, so I called twice. There was nothing \u2026 no dial tone, no phone call or anything,\" she told 10 News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then my daughter, who's seven, suggested using her dad's phone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter rolling him over and using his thumb to unlock the phone, Porcaro was able to get through to triple-zero.\n\n\n\nMore than 26 hours later, Optus gave her a call to see if she needed assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I said, 'We are already at the hospital. I don't need this, but I needed it then.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPorcaro says she feels lucky that she was able to get through to emergency services \u2014 but it was only because her husband has a different phone provider than she does.\n\n\n\n\n\nPorcaro is one of many Optus customers who were unable to call triple-zero when the network suffered an outage on Thursday , which led to multiple deaths . Porcaro's husband is with Telstra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It just makes me angry because I should be able to call triple-zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had another phone in the household, but it's not every day that my husband and I are home at the same time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter being with Optus for more than 15 years, she's now considering changing providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm definitely thinking about switching. I've been with Optus for more than 15 years, so I stuck by them after the last outage,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've already Googled this morning for other telcos I can look into.\"\n\n\n\n'Significant consequences'\n\nWhile Optus may lose goodwill with customers like Porcaro, it's also facing \"significant consequences\".\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells addressed the media on Monday morning, saying Optus will be \"held accountable for this failure\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have perpetuated a failure upon the Australian people with what has happened here. They can expect to suffer significant consequences as a result,\" she said.\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells said on Monday the Australian Communications and Media Authority has launched an investigation into the Optus network outage. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas The telco industry's regulator has launched an investigation into the network outage , and could impose financial penalties on Optus, although criminal charges cannot be laid under current legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptus CEO Stephen Rue said: \"Approximately 600 customers were potentially impacted, of which a proportion of their calls did not go through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have been advised that during the process of conducting welfare checks, three of the triple-zero calls involved households where a person tragically passed away,\" he said at a press conference on Friday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the deceased were from South Australia and one from Western Australia, Rue confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I offer my sincere and heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the people who passed away. I am so sorry for your loss. What has happened is completely unacceptable. We have let you down.\"\n\n\n\n",

Money and inheritance can bring out tensions in the best of families, and those fights can be exhausting and destructive.\n\nAs Donal Griffin, Sydney estate lawyer at Legacy Law and trust family adviser, often reminds me, one of the big flashpoints is the discretionary family trust. They work well for a couple, but once the next generation comes along things get tricky. Imagine being told in your 50s that you now have to run a trust with your brothers and sisters \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise sparks fly.\n\nThe Murdochs made headlines when they settled their family battle recently, but you don\u2019t need to be a billionaire to have trouble with siblings. Credit: Marija Ercegovac\n\nThe Murdochs\u2019 Nevada hearing, details of which were leaked to the media, showed how courts apply a black-letter approach when interpreting trust deeds. These are often signed without much thought, then forgotten until a dispute erupts.\n\nIt\u2019s not unlike a shareholders\u2019 agreement, which is ignored while business runs on consensus \u2013 until suddenly, it doesn\u2019t. While parents control trusts without involving their children, later they\u2019re often horrified to discover their adult children may not run things the same way. As Griffin says, the transition is from a monarchy to a democracy \u2013 and there\u2019s usually a revolution along the way.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Virginia Tapscott looks every inch the tradwife. She\u2019s blonde, petite, and pretty. Her hair is loose and long; the sleeveless lavender top she\u2019s worn to lunch matches her phone case. Photos of her with her husband and four children on the farm are redolent of the tradwife aesthetic. There\u2019s no doubt I could, if I wanted to, paint her as one of the \u201ctraditional wives\u201d that have been amassing huge social media followings for embracing the role of wife and mother, turning their backs on career-feminist empowerment. But Tapscott doesn\u2019t fit neatly into that box. In the course of our discussion, I wonder if there\u2019s any box that will ever contain this woman in all her contradictions. On the day we meet at Pyrmont\u2019s Zebra Lounge, she\u2019s flown from rural Albury to meet me. She loves seafood, and eating it by the water is a rare treat. The outdoor dining area looks out over a playground, deserted in the rain. The absence of children serves to emphasise the irony that Tapscott, who has written extensively about her choice to stay home with her children, is not home with her children. I want badly to ask her about that. Tapscott has a \u201ctradwife\u201d vibe, but she\u2019s not easy to pigeonhole. We hurry to get the ordering out of the way \u2013 there\u2019s so much Tapscott wants to talk about that if we don\u2019t do it now, we\u2019ll never cover off everything before she has to fly home. She\u2019s quick to choose the seared yellowfin tuna with a black poppyseed crust, but hesitates over the wine choice. She\u2019s looking at a French chardonnay, which is $18 a glass. Definitely not Albury prices. \u201cThat\u2019s so expensive!\u201d she exclaims, settling instead on an Alsace pinot gris. Tapscott has written a book, which she\u2019s keen to promote. All Mothers Work confronts the notion that women who choose to care for their children full-time are embracing a regressive social hierarchy. It challenges society to properly recognise and honour care work, paid and unpaid. She sent me the manuscript after we met at a conference last year. In contrast to her strong prose, she has a country reserve about her. She often holds back in public debates out of excessive politeness, waiting till everyone else has had a chance to speak. Yet, there\u2019s a certainty about her that comes through even when she\u2019s silent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe book gropes towards a new kind of feminism. \u201cThe only liberation that was ever offered or envisaged for women was one where they could be less like themselves,\u201d she writes. \u201cMen and women came to believe that the only way to help women was to allow them to assimilate into a man\u2019s world.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to think what I was thinking about when I wrote that,\u201d she muses. But then it comes to her. \u201cI think we have a really tough conversation to have about internalised misogyny. So ultimately, this idea that women could only be empowered by being in the paid workforce or assuming masculine roles is misogynistic.\u201d Seared yellowfin tuna with a black poppyseed crust. Credit: Edwina Pickles This is not the feminism of our times which, according to Tapscott, only supports unpaid caregivers by getting them out of unpaid work. Tapscott calls it \u201ccareer feminism in a care cloak\u201d. I need to know how the 34-year-old has developed such unfashionable ideas. Tapscott thinks it\u2019s down to her upbringing. Virginia Tapp grew up in rural Narrabri. Her dad died before she was born; her widowed mother worked on a farm, driving trucks and tractors, and doing the books. The kids didn\u2019t go to childcare, but just tagged along with their mother. As a result, she says, \u201cI feel a bit outside of the culture sometimes. I feel like I\u2019m looking in on the way society is, and the way culture is a lot of the time. It enables me to be hypercritical of it.\u201d Her exposure to mainstream culture was mainly through the radio that was constantly on in the background. That led to her interest in becoming a journalist. Her first job was at the ABC, followed by a stint at The Courier in Narrabri.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she had her first child at 25, her son Oscar, she planned to put him into childcare to continue her career. \u201cI remember having this conversation with my husband. Like, he\u2019s one now, this is what people do; women go back to paid work now.\u201d But it didn\u2019t work out. Oscar was miserable; she was too. When the second baby came along, Tapscott and her husband decided she would give up formal work and freelance where she could. \u201cWe were lucky,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe lived in a shack that my husband built on my father-in-law\u2019s property. We lived in a rural area. I still drove my Toyota Corolla I\u2019d had since uni. Our costs were just quite low, and we were young.\u201d She acknowledges this isn\u2019t an option for many families struggling with the cost of housing. Because the universe loves contrasts, this is the moment when our luxurious plates of food arrive. Tapscott exclaims at the beautifully plated tuna, seared lightly on the outside and extremely rare. My food envy dissipates as soon as I taste my seafood pasta, which is stacked with prawns and mussels and finished in a velvety red bisque. Seafood pasta stacked with prawns. Credit: Edwina Pickles Before she even takes a bite, Tapscott has leaped into telling me that she began writing compulsively about what it was like being a mother after her son was born. Her articles seemed to resonate with readers, and it set her on the path she\u2019s on now, saying more and more of the unsaid. She seems to have completely forgotten her food. Thank goodness it doesn\u2019t need to be hot because she\u2019s back in full flight. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to have this conversation because it\u2019s really uncomfortable. If we admit that the systems we have in place aren\u2019t optimal, we\u2019re admitting that the whole underpinning of women\u2019s liberation is flawed.\u201d Now seems a good time to ask my question about Tapscott\u2019s central contradiction: much of her writing has been about motherhood, the tug women feel to spend more time with their babies, and the choice to take on the work of child-rearing rather than paid work. Yet here she is in Sydney, a one-and-a-half-hour flight and a world away from her children, gesticulating passionately about the book she\u2019s just written. What part of this is not traditional workforce participation?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the first time in a while, she becomes still again. \u201cI can identify cultural forces that devalue caregivers, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m immune to them,\u201d she says with a wry smile. \u201cI am also a product of a culture where my self-worth is derived from my paid contributions, which has been a constant struggle for me in motherhood. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have worked to try and raise cultural awareness of the value of caregiving, so that my daughters and sons can grow up in a society where they get validation, and they feel valuable in a caregiving role.\u201d She fires up again. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we attract policy mechanisms that support caregivers? Because,\u201d she answers her own question, \u201cdeep down, most of us haven\u2019t really learnt the true value of caring\u201d. Our conversation is taking place in the aftermath of shocking revelations of widespread sexual and physical abuse of children in childcare centres. Nicola Forrest\u2019s Minderoo Foundation \u2013 which is behind the Thrive By Five campaign for universal centre-based childcare \u2013 has found that one in 10 parents has withdrawn children from care and 16 per cent have reduced hours of care. Minderoo says this is indicative of \u201ca system in crisis\u201d. Tapscott sees it as vindication and has ramped up her advocacy for childcare to be valued by giving parents greater choice in how it\u2019s delivered. Parents are questioning their childcare options after the industry has been rocked by a series of scandals. Credit: Justin McManus She\u2019s spoken and written about the need for more support for women to stay longer with their babies and to use the childcare subsidy now only available to centre-based care for more flexible modes of care, like grandparents, or nannies. Many parents are getting behind a campaign she is associated with. Which means I now have to move the conversation onto delicate ground. As she has explored in a podcast, Tapscott and her older sister were sexually touched by their step-grandfather when they were little. Her abuse happened in a home setting as she was being cared for by relatives. How does she square that with calling for more in-home care? Is home really better than a well-regulated childcare setting?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer tone drops and she hesitates. But she has obviously thought this through. Her answer is fluent and confident. \u201cPeople who say you can\u2019t support care in the homes because they\u2019re unregulated, and child sexual abuse occurs there are missing the point entirely in terms of primary prevention,\u201d she says. As a child sexual abuse survivor, she believes that the answer is to encourage people who\u2019ve experienced abuse to speak out, so offenders can\u2019t hide behind secrecy. \u201cAlso,\u201d she concludes, \u201cit\u2019s a ridiculous notion that any unregulated space is now not appropriate\u201d. That sounds like a vaguely libertarian idea. I want to know where she sees herself on the political spectrum because I for the life of me can\u2019t figure it out. On the one hand, her family advocacy and the whiff of trad-wifery might lead people to label her as right-leaning. But that\u2019s not borne out by her work. I\u2019ve scrawled a note against one passage in towards the end of her manuscript: \u201cCommunalist or communist?\u2033\u2063\n\n\u201cSo confused,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t really fit in anywhere.\u201d The bill. But then she confirms what I\u2019ve been wondering: \u201cI think my approach to early childhood is really quite influenced by socialism.\u201d Margin note triumphant. She goes on to explain: \u201cI think human capital is a public good, and we need to be investing in that. And individualism has really fallen down in the current macroeconomic environment that we have in Australia, where people can\u2019t and won\u2019t have more children because they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Somehow, despite talking non-stop, we\u2019ve finished our meals. I buy some time by ordering a coffee \u2013 she demures \u2013 and steer the conversation onto the unusual story of how her book has been published. \u201cThe only feasible way I could write it was if I had an advance because I just didn\u2019t really see myself being able to afford that much more free labour\u201d. So she crowdfunded the book. The All Mothers Work Kickstarter raised $33,000, covering childcare and printing costs. In the meantime, this advocate for the choice to stay home has started studying medicine. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI mean, health issues and my advocacy for caregivers, it\u2019s all connected. So many health issues, public health problems that arise from people not having time to care for themselves and for each other.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

The other three trains arrived at the next station and passengers disembarked within an hour.\n\nFor the \u201cincident train\u201d, passengers were on board for three hours and were left for long stretches without communication.\n\nOne passenger described how about 300 people were stuck with no water, no power and no air-conditioning.

There\u2019s a different style of diner, of course, and more competition. But also different produce, different suppliers, different landlords, different staff. Bar Monte opened in Newstead earlier this month. Markus Ravik Australian food and beverage is littered with stories of small-town stars who took on the big smoke and swiftly had their backsides handed to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you had to bet on anyone making it work, it\u2019s Arcade Agency, the hospitality \u201ccollective\u201d best known for Light Years, which originated in Byron Bay. And perhaps it already has, opening a Light Years in Perth in April; thus far, that restaurant has been a hit. Related Article 1930s Brisbane apartments transformed into stunning new restaurant Now comes Bar Monte in Brisbane. It\u2019s the second Bar Monte after the Gold Coast original, which opened in December. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s really convinced us to open in Brisbane was the impact Light Years has had in Perth,\u201d co-owner Lorenzo Toscani says. Bar Monte has transformed the old Allonda digs on Longland Street. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe vision with Light Years before I was with them was always to be in coastal towns \u2013 start in Byron Bay and then obviously move up to the Gold Coast, and then Noosa. And then right in the middle of COVID they came up with Newcastle, which was a big step-up in terms of capacity.\u201d This gradual approach has served Arcade Agency well, and it\u2019s taken place against the background of a food and beverage scene where \u2013 since the pandemic, in particular \u2013 the ties between the cities and the regions, between farmers and producers and the city eateries they serve, have become stronger and stronger. Bar Monte\u2019s menu is much the same as Miami, with clever twists on familiar classics. Markus Ravik \u201cWhen we opened on the Gold Coast we already had Brisbane in mind, as well,\u201d Toscani says. \u201cBrisbane is growing so fast at the moment, there will be the Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs an Italian who landed in Australia in 2012 and his first city was Brisbane, when I went back a couple of years ago, I really fell in love with how much it had changed. We saw the opportunity and wanted to be part of it.\u201d Vodka paccheri with nduja and stracciatella. Markus Ravik Bar Monte opened mid-September in the Longland Street tenancy previously occupied by Allonda. The bones of the place are the same, with the staircase to the right of the long bar that faces the entrance and laneway that runs between Longland and Wyatt streets. The fit-out by Studio Plenty is moodier and more intimate and playful than Allonda, with dark tiling and marble counters, timber panelling and clever feature lighting. The treatment is modern but nostalgic, and suits the restaurant\u2019s slightly hidden location.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYellow fin tuna with pineapple, green chilli, lemon and koji mayonnaise. Markus Ravik \u201c[Bar Monte] is \u2018neighbourhood Italian\u2019, so we wanted to make it look a little bit retro but with a trattoria feeling \u2013 that Italian feeling,\u201d Toscani says. The menu is similar to the Miami original, with engaging twists on familiar Italian items, particularly when it comes to snacks and entrees. Beef carpaccio with truffle mayo, fried capers, shallots, reggiano. Markus Ravik A burrata entree is spiked with nduja and cashew pesto, Ortiz anchovy toast is given a glow-up with smoked tomato butter, and there\u2019s a mortadella bun with pickled green chilli and limoncello aioli that\u2019s become a minor star at the Miami restaurant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pastas are all unctuous numbers that range from a cacio e pepe and prawn and chilli linguine, to mezze maniche served with pork sausage and Tuscan kale, and a vodka paccheri that tosses in nduja and is finished with a liberal dose of stracciatella. The restaurant retains the basic layout of Allonda before it but has been given a completely new look by designers Studio Plenty. Markus Ravik There\u2019s also a short menu of mains that spruces up classics such as bistecca, veal cotoletta, and a diavola chicken. For drinks, there\u2019s a fun, savoury-focused cocktail menu (caprese martini, celery margarita, that kind of thing) and a 100(ish)-bottle wine list compiled by award-winning sommelier Andrea Martinisi that focuses on Australian, Italian and French drops. The restaurant is tucked away on a small laneway just off Longland Street. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, if you\u2019re going to add to Brisbane\u2019s packed market of Italian restaurants, Bar Monte is a good way to do it. \u201cIn coastal towns there\u2019s a lot of competition, too, but because they get so busy during certain periods, especially during school holidays \u2013 you know you\u2019re going to be full no matter what,\u201d Toscani says. \u201cWith the city, you need to bring your right game.

    "text": "Australians are being urged to take a $2 Woolworths item with them on their next dog walk, as the strong but mighty accessory could be the difference between life and death if they encounter a snake.\n\nWith spring signalling the start of snake season, survival expert Mike Atkinson told Yahoo News he continues to attach one of Woolworths' foldable bags to his dog's leash in case his beloved Labrador Ollie is bitten by a snake. He explained that a few quick adjustments to the bag can make it into an easy sling, enabling him to carry his dog if they are out on a walk or hike and are far away from help.\n\n\"Dogs have much faster metabolisms than humans, so keeping them still is really important,\" he told Yahoo, explaining you don't want to encourage the venom to spread through the circulatory system. \"So the Woolworth's bag, it's shaped like a carrot. They scrunch down really small and they're strong... You just slit the sides, and it makes a sling.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRecently, Ollie almost died from anaphylaxis after being bitten by a jack jumper ant while out on a walk. In a desperate bid to get him to the closest vet, Mike encouraged his dog to run alongside him to get to the car quicker. But he was later told that running likely contributed to the spreading of the ant venom, and Ollie almost died. Having an aid that enables dogs to be kept as still as possible while the owner can cover ground can be hugely beneficial.\n\n\"My dog weighs 36 kilograms and I've tried carrying him for long distances and my arms get too tired, whereas this just allows you to take most of the weight off your arms if you need it,\" he said.\n\nThe Woolworths bag can be cut along the sides to be made into a makeshift sling. Source: TikTok/outbackmike\n\nWhat to do if your dog is bitten by a snake?\n\nIf a dog is bitten by a snake, the first thing to do is to keep the dog as still as possible. If bitten on the leg, compression bandages can help to limit the spread, and the sling can be used to carry the dog, Atkinson said. Ultimately, getting your dog to the closest vet with anti-venom is essential.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis advice was echoed by Dr Liam Donaldson from Greencross Vet Hospital, who previously told Yahoo News common signs that a dog was bitten by a snake include \"vomiting, collapsing, dilated pupils and the inability to walk\".\n\n\"In dogs, we commonly see vomiting and collapse before a very quick recovery. This recovery is only short-lived, before the toxin has its most fatal effect of causing breathing paralysis,\" Donaldson said.\n\nPreventative measures, such as snake-proofing yards with fencing and \"keeping them on a lead in a snake-y spot\" or \"not walking them in a snake-y spot\", can help safeguard dogs.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
