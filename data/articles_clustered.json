    "text": "We can now add \"sitting on the dunny\" to the growing list of things smartphones and social media are helping to ruin.\n\nA new study out of the US found that people who used their phone while sitting on the toilet had a significantly higher risk of developing haemorrhoids.\n\n\ufeffCethan Ramprasad and colleagues, from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, reported that out of their survey participants, 66 per cent reported using smartphones on the toilet, and they tended to be younger than non-users.\n\nSpending more time on the toilet - while scrolling on a phone, for example - can increase the risk of haemorrhoids. (Getty)\n\nAfter statistically accounting for other factors thought to possibly be linked with hemorrhoid risk \u2013 such as exercise habits, age, and fibre intake \u2013 the researchers found that participants who used a smartphone on the toilet had a 46 per cent higher risk of hemorrhoids than non-users.\n\nStrictly speaking, it's not the phone itself that's the issue, but the increased amount of time users spend on the porcelain throne while staring at the screen.\n\n\"It's incredibly easy to lose track of time when we're scrolling on our smartphones\u2014popular apps are designed entirely for that purpose,\" study senior author Trisha Pasricha said.\n\n\"But it's possible that constantly sitting longer on the toilet than you intended because you're distracted by your smartphone could increase your risk of hemorrhoids.\n\n\"We need to study this further, but it's a safe suggestion to leave the smartphone outside the bathroom when you need to have a bowel movement.\"\n\n\ufeffDr Jarrah Dowrick, research fellow with the Gastrointestinal Research Group at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute at the University of Auckland, was sceptical of the direct phone link but said the result was an \"important finding\".\n\n\"While the reality of modern screen addiction does make the smartphone narrative more compelling, the real story here is that spending longer on a seated toilet appears to be linked with haemorrhoid presentation,\" he said.\n\n\"Phone or no, this study suggests limiting each visit to the toilet to five minutes when possible\ufeff.\"\n\nVictoria University digital wellness expert Dr Alex Beattie\ufeff said the study provided another example of how smartphones had infiltrated every corner of people's lives.\n\n\"It's quite telling that the study found men were more likely than women to use their phones on the toilet, though this difference wasn't statistically significant,\" Beattie said.\n\n\"Still, it reflects a broader truth of this digitally saturated era \u2013 that smartphones are often used as a form of escape: from parenting, from domestic routines, and sometimes from other people.\"",

    "text": "Imagine having your own space at work. For most Australians working in corporate offices, it's a far-off dream.\n\nMore than 2.2 million Aussies aged 15 to 24 were employed in July 2025, most of whom have only ever known the chatter and distraction of open-plan offices.\n\nBut there was a time \u2013 one older members of the workforce still recall \u2013 when the cubicle reigned supreme in offices all over the country.\n\nCubicles made a comeback in the TV series Severance, but could they return to Aussie offices? (Apple TV+)\n\nA time before hotdesking and being exposed to every sight, sound and smell in the office was the norm, despite how detrimental it can be to our ability to actually work.\n\nBut as businesses try to coax \ufeffemployees back into offices after years of work-from-home (WFH) arrangements, could 2025 be the year Australia finally resurrects the cubicle?\n\nOne expert says it's not entirely out of the question.\ufeff\n\nThe death of the office cubicle\n\nOnce an Aussie office staple, cubicles were largely phased out by the 2000s.\n\nThey were meant to be an affordable alternative to private offices that still gave employees a sense of space and privacy.\n\nBut over time, some employees and employers came to view \"cubicle farms\" as oppressive and isolating.\n\nOnce an office staple, cubicles came to be seen as oppressive and isolating over time. (Getty)\n\nMany adopted \ufeffopen-plan layouts instead.\n\nPopularised by architect Frank Lloyd Wright\ufeff, egalitarian open-plan offices would \ufeffencourage workers to communicate, collaborate, solve problems and generate ideas.\n\nOr so the theory went.\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\"Unfortunately, it hasn't actually worked out that way,\" MBA director and Associate Professor of Organisational Behaviour at Bond University, Dr Libby Sander told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"If we look at a big body of research over the last 15 years, what it shows conclusively is that just putting people together in one room doesn't make them do all those things.\n\n\"In fact, it can often do the opposite.\"\n\nThe open-plan problem\n\nTo work in an open-plan office is to be distracted.\ufeff\n\nAussie workers report the constant noise makes it significantly harder to get work done, with some saying they can be \ufeffdistracted 80 times in a single morning.\n\nIt doesn't even need to be a direct distraction, like being asked a question or roped into a conversation, either.\n\nAussie workers report that open-plan offices are rife with distractions, much like the Dunder Mifflin office in The Office TV series. (NBC)\n\n\ufeffA study Sander ran found that \ufeffworkers exposed to standard open-plan office noise, even over a short period of time, experienced a 34 per cent spike in physiological stress and a 25 per cent increase in negative mood.\n\n\"When you couple that with the interruptions and distractions of people actually coming up and talking to you, or having a meeting next to your desk ... it's very, very difficult for people to do focused and concentrated work,\" Sander said.\n\n\"They become more withdrawn, even hostile in some cases ... because they get very, very frustrated that they just can't concentrate.\"\n\nResearch also shows it can take up to 20 minutes to get back on task after being distracted \u2013 and that's bad for business.\n\nIt's part of why so many Aussies have latched onto WFH arrangements and refuse to let go, even years post-pandemic.\ufeff\n\nThe highest paid jobs that let you work from home View Gallery\n\nThe rise of \ufeffhotdesking and \"activity-based working\" hasn't helped either.\n\nWhile it can work for some industries and roles, even Sander agreed \"a lot of people are very unhappy with\" having to share desks with colleagues that don't always clean up after themselves \u2013 if they can find a desk at all.\ufeff\n\n\ufeffResurrecting the cubicle - or something like it\n\nWith many businesses still trying to coax\ufeff workers back into the office, now seems like the perfect time to address the layout issues that make staff reluctant to return.\n\n\"Companies are starting to realise the impact that noise, distraction and interruption actually has on their employee, which is their biggest expense,\" Sander said.\n\n\"And that the savings you make in real estate by not giving everyone their own space, or cramming everyone into an open plan space, doesn't actually pay off in the long term.\"\n\nAccording to Sander, \"cramming everyone into an open plan space, doesn't actually pay off in the long term\". (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut the solution isn't as simple as resurrecting cubicles in every office.\n\nInstead, Sander recommended businesses design office layouts specific to \ufeffthe work employees need to get done.\n\nThat could mean cubicles, private offices, or a well-designed open-plan \ufefflayout with private spaces available.\n\nSome companies have already invested in small, free-standing office \"booths\" where staff can work without distraction.\ufeff\n\nIt may also mean allowing long-term WFH arrangements; whatever works best for staff just trying to get the job done.\ufeff\n\n\"There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer,\" Sander said.\n\n\"Because ultimately, you need to have a variety of options for people who have a variety of needs\ufeff.\"\n\nSmall, free-standing office 'booths' can allow staff to work without distraction. (Getty)\n\nAnd with a looming talent shortage, \ufeffaging populations and declining birth rates, businesses that don't try to meet staff needs risk falling behind those that do.\ufeff\n\n\"As we understand more and more the impact of noise and distraction, we are going to see better-designed offices with better acoustics, more dividers, less open-plan space, so people can actually concentrate and get their work done,\" Sander said.\n\n\"If you're not doing that, your competitors are already doing it or going to do it, and you're going to get left behind.\"\n\nHave you got a story?

(Supplied)\n\nOzolins told 9news.com.au her life-changing diagnosis began with a \"dull ache\" in her side.\n\nShe initially ignored the symptom.\n\nAfter all, her job in marketing was incredibly busy and she had a family to look after.\n\nSix months later, the ache returned.\n\n\"Then over the weeks, it got a bit worse, and I was like, 'OK, I've got to go to the doctor',\" Ozolins said.\n\n\"I woke up yellow with jaundice.\n\n\"So I got sent straight to emergency and went to the public hospital and it turned out that it was a blocked bile duct.\"\n\nA routine day surgery to have her gallbladder removed turned into a long day at the hospital and some unwelcome news: it was a tumour and it was cancerous.\n\nOzolins' husband Greg has just flown out on a surfing trip on a remote Indonesian island, her mum was away and her daughter was doing her HSC.\n\nThe timing couldn't have been worse \u2013 but as Ozolins attested, nobody is ever prepared for cancer.\n\nDo you have a story?

[Pancreatic cancer] never would even be on my radar that I would get at 48,\" she added.\n\nDoctors put her on a \"sledgehammer\" treatment plan including Whipple surgery, which removed her pancreas, and chemotherapy.\n\n\"They put me on the hardest dose. I was literally in bed for six months, just surviving,\" Ozolins said.\n\n\"It was horrible. But I thought we got it all and it was preventative.\"\n\nThe first scan after chemotherapy showed the cancer had spread to Ozolins' lungs.\n\nIt was a gut-punch after the torture of cancer treatment.\n\nHer doctor said she had nine to 12 months to live \u2013 unless she could be placed on a drug trial.\n\nA stroke of luck and support from her oncology team meant Ozolins could be put on a targeted therapy clinical trial.\n\n\"The doctors, for the first time in a while, are happy with my results,\" Ozolins said.\n\n\"But it will come down to the scan in a few weeks to see if my tumour is shrinking and the trial is working.\"\n\nSadly, restricted trial numbers meant another cancer patient missed out on a spot.\n\nOzolins said this fact breaks her heart.\ufeff\n\nIt will be a long road ahead but Ozolins and her family have been given the gift of hope.\n\nThe 49-year-old Sydney mum is undergoing a drug therapy trial.

And I went and got tested and I've got pancreatic cancer',\" she said.\n\nThe mum-of-two is feeling hopeful and positive.\n\nHer stoic exterior belies her fear \u2013 but Ozolins wants to find purpose in her pain.\n\n\"If it's a five-year survival rate, then that's a win. And then we go from there,\" she added.\n\n\"I'm hoping my personal story will trigger people to actually put their money where their mouth is.\n\n\"Every drip makes a lake and makes this possible.\"\n\nLearn more or donate to Remember September here.",

Photo shows A graphic showing a hand holding a phone. It is superimposed on a drawing of Australia and surrounded by social media apps Australia is months away from implementing its world-first social media ban for teens. But questions still remain around how the restrictions will work.\n\nThese are some of the ways young people could be assessed when trying to set up or hold onto social media accounts from December.\n\nWith the federal government's social media ban for under-16s looming, a range of age-assurance technologies have been trialled to see whether it can be done effectively while also protecting privacy.\n\nA user's age could be determined to a reasonable degree of confidence in a variety of ways, according to a recent study.\n\nBut it also found every way included risks and shortcomings, adding that companies might need multiple \"fallback options\".\n\nHere's what young people might be required to do.\n\nNo 'single ubiquitous solution'\n\nThe government commissioned a survey by a British consultancy firm, testing more than 60 technologies from 48 age assurance vendors.\n\nLandmark study of age verification warns of risks Photo shows An iPhone screen The study, which will inform the government's impending social media ban for under-16s, found several methods were viable, but no method was foolproof, with concerns over both accuracy and privacy.\n\nTheir report found \"age assurance [could] be done in Australia privately, efficiently and effectively\", adding there was \"a plethora\" of choices.\n\n\"But we did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases,\" the report said.\n\nThe study presented several methods that could be used and grouped them into three main categories.\n\n1. Age verification\n\nThe first approach involved traditional age verification tools, which relied on official documents such as passports to verify a user's date of birth.\n\nA user would need to upload their ID, which would then be analysed for validity, often through third-party identity verification service providers.\n\n\"Age verification represents the most direct and high-assurance form of age assurance and is already in widespread use across many regulated industries,\" the report said.\n\nExisting social media accounts owned by children under the age of 16 will be deactivated under the ban. (ABC News: Mary Lloyd)\n\nConcerns have been raised about the risks associated with the process.\n\nLa Trobe University's director of AI strategy Daswin De Silva said age verification methods had \"low privacy protection\".\n\nHe said formal identification documents were usually assigned to high-trust institutions such as governments and banks, not low-trust services like social media companies.\n\n\"Given the sensitive nature of any information related to children, they can be exposed to subsequent harms and risks,\" he said.\n\nFormal personal data could be used alongside other forms of unverified data collection to paint a broad picture of a person and their interests, he added.\n\n\"If we use a bit more AI, we can actually predict their behaviours in the next few months, few years,\" he told the ABC.\n\nThis kind of information could be gathered at scale and used for advertising, online gambling or other commercial interests, and put those people at risk of a data breach, he said.\n\n2. Age estimation\n\nAge estimation uses AI and machine learning to conduct biometric analysis \u2014 via data on facial features, voice and motion \u2014 to predict a person's age.\n\n\"Unlike age verification, which relies on known and validated dates of birth, age estimation applies biometric or statistical techniques \u2026 to predict age without the need for formal identity documents,\" the report said.\n\nThe process generally involves a person taking a photo or recording audio or video of themselves.\n\nThat content is then analysed by an AI language model to determine someone's age.\n\nAge-checking tech for social media ban mistakes kids for 37-year-olds Photo shows A video stream on a laptop, showing a women with green lines and dots all over her face Children as young as 15 were repeatedly misidentified as being in their 20s and 30s during government tests of age-checking tools, sowing new doubts about whether the teen social media ban is viable.\n\nThe information is then communicated to a third party, and the photo or recording is deleted.\n\n\"You'd use a few of these combinations. Face, voice and motion data in combination to determine a signature for age,\" Professor Da Silva said.\n\n\"We use lots of past data of similar situations and then train the AI to recognise age or age groups: the simplest scenario would be adults versus child.\"\n\nAge estimation is considered to have a lower privacy risk.\n\nIt could also be used for people who do not have access to formal documents, Justine Humphrey, senior lecturer in Digital Cultures at The University of Sydney, said.\n\nHowever, there can be issues with inaccuracies.\n\n\"It was found that there were variations in accuracy, particularly for some groups, although there were relatively high levels of accuracy overall,\" Dr Humphrey told the ABC.\n\nOften, older people, \"non-whites and girls, or female-presenting individuals\" were among those experiencing variations of accuracy, she said.\n\nThe ABC reported earlier this year that face-scanning technology tested on school students could only guess their age within an 18-month range in 85 per cent of cases.\n\nThe report also noted false negatives were \"inevitable\".\n\nA false negative is when someone over 16 is deemed to be underage, and false positives would be those who are under 16 but deemed to be over-age.\n\nThe report said alternative methods of verification would be required to correct them.\n\n3. Age inference\n\nThe trial also examined age inference technologies, which do not require age verification such an ID.\n\nInstead, they use third-party sources to analyse online behavioural patterns and activity, and online account data, to estimate age.\n\n\"Age inference draws reasonable conclusions about age by analysing facts such as school enrolment, financial transactions, content barring settings, service usage or participation in age-specific activities,\" the report said.\n\nA third-party age inference provider scans for records from a trusted source, such as an electoral status, and once that is confirmed, common sense is used to assume an age or age range.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nDr Hassan Asghar, a senior lecturer in computer science at Macquarie University, said age inference was among the more \"concerning approaches\".\n\n\"Age inference works by watching what we do online over long periods to guess our age \u2014 essentially encouraging tech companies to constantly monitor our digital behaviour,\" he said.\n\n\"That's a pretty significant shift toward surveillance.\"\n\nProfessor De Silva said the risks were similar to age verification.\n\n\"For example, if someone posted [online], 'I received my driving licence today' in 2017, that is the equivalence of having access to the information on the drivers licence, specifically the date it was issued,\" he said.\n\nParental consent and controls were also flagged as options.\n\nThose controls involved parents and guardians in the process, using a set of tools that allowed them to restrict or monitor a child's access to digital content.\n\nOnus is still on tech giants\n\nThe ban on under-16s creating or holding their own social media accounts covers a wide range of platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, X and YouTube.\n\nThe federal government will soon reveal \"reasonable steps\" platforms will be required by law to take to comply with the ban, such as standards for accuracy or certain safeguards for privacy.\n\nBut they will not be required to use a specific method to verify the age of their users.\n\nDr Asghar from Macquarie University said it was \"worrying\" the government was not specifying which technologies social media companies should use.\n\n\"They could potentially use any combination of these methods,\" he said.\n\n\"This means our data could end up scattered across numerous systems, and we know from countless data breaches that the more places our information sits, the higher the chance it gets compromised.\"\n\nSocial media companies have already started to utilise age assurance tests.\n\nThe report noted both Meta and Snapchat had started using facial age estimation technology, while Apple announced its own trial on age identification.\n\nLoading...\n\nDr Humphrey said she held reservations as to how strict compliance would be on social media companies that did not take the \"reasonable steps\" outlined by the government.\n\n\"We're yet to find out what forms of methods of compliance will be put in place to ensure that providers implement age assurance reliably and responsibly,\" she said.\n\n\"We're yet to see how those regulators [will enforce it], what methods they'll use to enforce or provide oversight.\n\n\"But we know that tech companies are often \u2014 if not antagonistic, they're not necessarily responsive to those sorts of requests and compliance orders.\"",

    "text": "For 20,000 older Australians who have been patiently waiting for assistance to help them live at home, Wednesday's announcement that the government will immediately fund more packages is \"very significant\".\n\nThat is according to independent aged care expert and former acting inspector general of aged care, Ian Yates, who says the help will go to people who have been waiting many months, often in \"quite desperate\" circumstances.\n\nThe packages were part of 83,000 already promised by the government. The change announced on Wednesday was to bring forward the release of 20,000.\n\nAged care reforms delayed after sector raised survival issues Photo shows Elderly patient The biggest reforms to aged care in three decades have been delayed until November.\n\nAged Care Minister Sam Rae described the move as a \"huge win\" for older people, despite earlier resisting pressure to alter the timing of the rollout.\n\nThe reason there was such pressure, from not only across parliament but the aged care sector as well, was because all the packages were originally due to start being rolled out from July, but that was pushed back to November, alongside the rest of the aged care reforms.\n\nThat left a four-month gap in the release of any new packages, while the waitlist for people waiting for their approved support grew.\n\nWhile the government said there were some \"caveats\" around the accuracy of the new data, Shadow Aged Care Minister Anne Ruston revealed on Wednesday that more than 108,000 older people were waiting for at-home help they had been approved for.\n\nAnother 121,000 people were in the queue for an assessment.\n\n'A good start,' says Ageing Australia\n\nGiven the length of the two waitlists, there was widespread acknowledgement that the earlier release of these packages was just the start.\n\nThe chief executive of Ageing Australia, Tom Symondson, welcomed the move, but said a continual need for more packages would remain.\n\n\"They make a really good start on clearing that waiting list,\" he said.\n\n\"We know that the number of people requiring home care is going to massively expand over the next 10 and 20 years.\"\n\nThe latest data shows 108,000 older people are waiting for at-home help they have been approved for, and another 120,000 are waiting to be assessed. (AAP: Glenn Hunt)\n\nMr Yates said recommendations from the 2021 Aged Care Royal Commission also insisted the waitlist should be expeditiously eliminated, and should not be allowed to recur.\n\nTo ensure that, Mr Yates said the government needed to continue to increase its funding for at-home help.\n\n\"It's very important that the government review its budget provision in light of the numbers confirmed on the waitlist,\" he said.\n\nWhat happens beyond the 83,000 packages?\n\nMr Rae said that with an ageing population, the program's growth was an \"absolute given\", insisting that it would not be a one-in, one-out system beyond mid-next year, when all the new packages were rolled out.\n\n\"There will have to be ongoing growth in the program \u2014 the program is designed to better fit with an ageing population,\" he said.\n\nMr Rae said the system had already grown from 120,000 people in 2020 to more than 300,000 people today.\n\nAged Care Minister Sam Rae described the move as a \"huge win\" for older people (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nQuestioned about it readiness on Friday, the sector assured a parliamentary inquiry into the delayed aged care reforms that it had the capacity to provide more at-home support to older people.\n\nThe department also conceded there was no technical reason it could not release more packages, other than a decision made by the government.\n\nMr Symondson said for \"months and months and months\" the sector was ready to ramp up, which was partly possible because the majority of support workers were not full-time and were keen to increase their hours.\n\nPlus, the most acute workforce shortage was among nurses, he said, whereas the bulk of assistance required was for domestic support with cleaning and meals.\n\nWhat's the difference between the old system and the new?\n\nAlong with the name change \u2014 from Home Care Packages to Support at Home \u2014 there are big practical changes for those receiving the help.\n\nAll recipients will transition to the new program, but there is a \"no worse off\" guarantee for those on, or approved for, a package before September 12, 2024.\n\nMore than 120,000 older Australians waiting to be assessed for help at home Photo shows An elderly man in silhouette sitting in a chair looking at trees. The government promised to release 83,000 packages to help clear the lengthy waitlist for at-home supports in July, but the extra packages have been pushed back to November.\n\nOthers, however, will have to pay contributions based on their income and assets for services other than \"clinical supports,\" which include nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.\n\n\"There will be significantly higher co-payments in the support at home program for people across the board, basically,\" Mr Yates said.\n\nBecause of that, the impact of those changes needed to be closely monitored, Mr Symondson said.\n\n\"We are already hearing from older people that they're concerned they won't be able to afford those co-contributions,\" he said.\n\nThere will also be eight levels of support, instead of the current four.\n\nThe separate Commonwealth Home Support Program, or CHSP, which provides lower-level help, will remain until at least July 1, 2027, when it is set to fold into the new scheme.",

    "text": "Death and money are tough topics to think about. It's why many of us haven't planned for who will receive our superannuation when we die.\n\n\"So many people don't want to think about their own mortality,\" says estate planning lawyer Melisa Sloan, based in Melbourne/Naarm.\n\nThere are also a lot of misconceptions around nominating a beneficiary for our superannuation, explains Ms Sloan.\n\nAnd for single people without kids, there is an added layer of complexity.\n\nNew research shows at least 6.5 million Australians will not have a say in who inherits their superannuation because of the way super members are prompted to inform funds of who they wish to receive their savings after their death.\n\nWhile this news has highlighted the importance of understanding the difference between making a \"non-binding\" or \"binding\" nomination, knowing who you can leave your super to \u2014 and how \u2014 is also critical.\n\nFor people who are not married or in a de facto relationship, and don't have children, choosing someone such as a parent or sibling isn't straightforward, as they most often don't meet the criteria for a binding nomination.\n\n\"Being empowered with the knowledge of who you can leave super to, and the tax implications, can make a significant financial difference of how super will be paid to beneficiaries,\" says Ms Sloan.\n\nWhat is a super beneficiary and who can you nominate?\n\nA superannuation beneficiary nomination is a formal way to tell your super fund who you want to receive your super death benefit when you die.\n\nWhy it's time to review your will Photo shows A woman holds a white pen while reviewing a document bound in a leather case. We should be reviewing our wills and estate plans every two to three years, estates lawyer Gillian Hunter says\n\nNatasha Janssens, a financial educator and behavioural money coach, says many people mistakenly believe you can nominate anyone to inherit your super.\n\nBut a beneficiary can be a spouse, children, someone who is in an interdependency relationship with you, someone who is financially dependent on you, or your estate or legal representative.\n\nYou have the option of making a \"non-binding\" nomination \u2014 a quick process that can often be completed online \u2014 or a \"binding\" nomination, which is a more complex process.\n\nMs Janssens says a binding nomination must be followed by the trustee of your super fund, providing it's a valid nomination (properly signed and naming a valid beneficiary).\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\n\"A non-binding nomination does not have to be followed \u2014 it is merely a statement of your preferences, but the ultimate decision resides with the trustee of your super fund.\"\n\nMore than a third of Australians surveyed by Super Consumers Australia had no death benefit nomination registered with their super fund \u2014 and a further 25 per cent did not know if their nomination was binding.\n\nMs Sloan says another common assumption is that super forms part of a will, but super is not an asset of someone's estate.\n\n\" It's alarming the amount of people who don't know that. \"\n\nYour options when you have no spouse or dependants\n\nIf you want to leave super to someone such as a parent, friend, or sibling, you'll need to complete a beneficiary nomination and appoint your legal personal representative, Ms Janssens explains.\n\n\"The situation may be different for an 18-year-old living at home who may have an interdependency relationship with her parents, and so could nominate her parents as beneficiaries for super.\n\n\"On the other hand, a woman living independently wouldn't be able to nominate her parents and as such would have to nominate her estate if she wished for her parents or a sibling or friend to receive the super.\"\n\nWho can inherit your superannuation? Photo shows A golden egg in a nest symbolising superannuation. Consumers are being urged to make 'binding' death benefit nominations to avoid lengthy legal disputes between family members and loved ones.\n\nMs Sloan says when someone nominates a legal personal representative (executor of their estate), the money will be paid to them and they can distribute the money in accordance with the will.\n\nYou will need to have a will in place to achieve this.\n\n\"It's a roundabout way to get it to them,\" Ms Sloan says.\n\nOur experts say people without a spouse or dependents should seek legal advice before making a nomination and deciding whether it's best to make a binding nomination for a specific person or handle it through the estate.\n\n\"There are numerous considerations to be made here including tax implications as well as risks of challenges to the estate should your super be handled in that manner,\" Ms Janssens says.\n\nRevisit to reflect changes to your relationship status\n\nMs Janssens says people should make sure nominations are up to date when their relationship status changes.\n\nAdd to your watchlist Photo shows Mystery Road Origin ABC iview with young detective Jay Swan in the bush.

    "text": "American Amanda Anisimova has upset Iga \u015awi\u0105tek 6-4, 6-3 in the US Open quarterfinals, less than two months after losing to the six-time grand slam champion in the Wimbledon final 6-0, 6-0.\n\nThe number eight-seeded Anisimova reached her third major semifinal and first at Flushing Meadows.\n\n\"To come back from Wimbledon like that is really special to me,\" said Anisimova, a 24-year-old who was born in New Jersey and grew up in Florida.\n\n\"I feel like I worked so hard to try and turn around from that \u2026 Today is really special.\"\n\nThe powerful strokes and poise she displayed in Arthur Ashe Stadium against number two \u015awi\u0105tek \u2014 the 2022 US Open champion \u2014 were such a striking contrast to what happened at the All England Club's Centre Court on July 12.\n\nThat title match lasted just 57 minutes, and Anisimova only managed to win 24 points that day, a total she eclipsed about midway through the first set this time.\n\nAnisimova cried during her runner-up speech during the trophy ceremony at Wimbledon; after this match, though, she was all smiles while addressing thousands of supportive spectators who kept interrupting her on-court interview with cheers.\n\n\"Playing here is so freaking special,\" Anisimova said.\n\nDemon's US Open run ends in quarters Photo shows Alex de Mianur playing a backhand tennis shot, with one hand, outstretched It is heartbreak for Alex de Minaur once again at the US Open, as the Australian fails to break through to the semifinals at a major for the first time in his career.\n\n\"And I've been having the run of my life here.\"\n\nAnisimova served first and got broken immediately when she lost three points in a row by missing forehands \u2014 one into the net, one wide, one long.\n\nBut Anisimova broke right back and soon was the one dictating points with her strong, flat groundstrokes that wound up contributing to 23 total winners, 10 more than \u015awi\u0105tek accumulated.\n\nAnisimova also played quite cleanly, making just 12 unforced errors.\n\nIn the second set, Anisimova fell behind again, this time 2-0.\n\nBut she again regrouped and quickly gained the upper hand. \u015awi\u0105tek was the one looking increasingly frustrated, shaking her head or slumping her shoulders between points, spreading her arms wide and looking to her coach for advice, and leaning back in her changeover chair as if pondering what, exactly, she could do differently.\n\nWhen \u015awi\u0105tek double-faulted to trail 5-3 in the second set, that allowed Anisimova to serve out the victory.\n\n\"From the get-go, I was trying to fire myself up,\" Anisimova said.\n\n\"She is one of the toughest players I've ever played. I knew I was going to have to dig deep.\"\n\nAnisimova to face Osaka in last four\n\nNaomi Osaka took 109 minutes to beat Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1 and reach the US Open semifinals. (Getty Images: Clive Brunskill)\n\nAnisimova will try to reach a second consecutive major final when she faces four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka in the semifinals.\n\nOsaka defeated Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) in a match that should have been straightforward but wasn't, despite the player from Czechia being hampered by injury for much of the match.\n\nSome of Osaka's forehands were simply exceptional, but the Japanese star failed to take full advantage of her opponent's limitations after she had a medical timeout and received attention on her left thigh.\n\nDespite obvious discomfort, Muchov\u00e1 held things together to force a second set tie-break, but when she went 3-1 down the end was near.\n\nShe came close to grabbing the mini-break back, but her almost-winner was 1 millimetre out.\n\nOsaka held four match points, and although she gave away the first, she forced the error from Muchov\u00e1 that ended the match.\n\nWhenever Osaka has previously made it to the quarterfinal of a major tournament, she has gone on to win.\n\nShe has two Australian Opens and two US Open titles to her name, and she is now two matches away from a third crown at Flushing Meadows.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "Stage 11 of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ended with no winner after organisers ordered a finish 3 kilometres from the line due to pro-Palestinian protesters causing disruption in Bilbao.\n\n\"Due to some incidents at the finish line, we have decided to take the time at 3 kilometres before the line,\" was the announcement made by the race director on Radio Vuelta.\n\n\"We won't have a stage winner. We will give the points for the mountain classification and the intermediate sprint, but not on the finish line.\"\n\nDisruptions began early when the race was stopped in the neutral zone after protesters carrying a banner gathered on the road before they were ushered to the side by police.\n\nLate in the race, protesters pulled a banner across the road in front of the peloton, which got past without any problems. Basque and Palestinian flags were waved all along the route.\n\nBasque Minister of Security Bingen Zupiria told reporters that three people were arrested, another five identified and that four members of the regional police were injured during the protests.\n\nThe 157.4km stage, which began and ended in Bilbao, was into the final 20 kilometres when the announcement came, while the main general classification riders were battling it out ahead of the peloton.\n\nRace leader Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Britain's Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team) broke away from their rivals in the final kilometres to come to the premature finish first.\n\nVingegaard moved further clear in the general classification and has a 50-second lead over Jo\u00e3o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) while Pidcock moved into third spot, a further 6 seconds back, with one-time leader Torstein Tr\u00e6en (Bahrain Victorious) dropping to fourth.\n\nPidcock made his move on the final climb, Alto de Pike, and Vingegaard was the only rider able to go with him, leaving Almeida, who began the day third overall and 38 seconds off the leader, trailing.\n\nAfter the peloton foiled any early breaks, a 12-man group that included most of the GC contenders left the peloton behind close to the summit of El Vivero, 24 kilometres from the finish line.\n\nThe race had already passed through the finishing stretch earlier in the stage, and it was clear that police were struggling to contain the hundreds of Palestinian-flag-waving protesters.\n\n\"We went through the finish line, we saw them already there kind of on the road, I think the police kept them off there,\" Vingegaard said.\n\n\"There was one time when they tried to block us on the second-last climb but we just went through.\"\n\nThere was a surreal end to the race, with Vingegaard and Pidcock unsure of where exactly the new finish line was.\n\n\"It's hard to describe the disappointment, to be honest,\" Pidcock said.\n\nThomas Pidcock and Jonas Vingegaard were leading stage 11 of the Vuelta but did not have the chance to race for the stage win. (Getty Images: Dario Belingheri)\n\n\"I felt like today was my day. I feel like there should always be a finish line.\"\n\nThe Briton also had a message for the protesters.\n\n\"Putting us in danger isn't going to help your cause,\" he said.\n\nVingegaard was also disappointed, with the Dane having a special reason to go for the stage win.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"It's my son's birthday, he's one year old today so I wanted to win for him,\" Vingegaard said.\n\n\"We worked all day for it and to not get the chance is obviously a big shame.\"\n\nBefore the stage, the Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) had called for better security at the Vuelta after a number of incidents involving protesters had already brought concern over rider safety, with the Israel-Premier Tech team the main target.\n\nThere were incidents on Tuesday's stage 10 that caused a rider to crash, and also during stage five's team time trial when the Israel-Premier Tech team were stopped on the road by a group of protesters holding Palestinian flags.\n\nStage 12 on Thursday is scheduled to take place over 144.9km from Laredo to Los Corrales de Buelna.\n\nReuters/ABC",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Adorned with \u201cindecent\u201d sculptures, Sydney\u2019s idiosyncratic Reader\u2019s Digest building has confounded the public since it was unveiled in 1967 as an idealistic Mad Men-esque workplace. It was conceived as art as architecture. Or architecture as art. And its fans say it may just be the most fabulously ugly thing you\u2019ve ever seen. SJB director Adam Haddow loves the way its architect John James married an obsession with Gothic architecture with Brutalism. \u201cI call it Beaut-alism,\u201d Haddow said. Haddow\u2019s SJB and architect Matthew Byrnes of Design 5 \u2013 Architects have unveiled plans for a $23 million adaptive reuse project to start later this year. It will turn the 4200-square-metre heritage-listed building in Waterloo Street into a \u201choney pot for creative activity\u201d in Surry Hills. The Reader\u2019s Digest building in Surry Hills. Credit: \u201cIt should become the Surry Hills Town Hall, emotionally at least, because there isn\u2019t one \u2013 unless you count the Clock Hotel,\u201d said Haddow, who lives a five-minute walk away. Built to house the Reader\u2019s Digest\u2019s state-of-the-art $1 million computer that was the size of a small home, and its ground-floor printing presses, the offices were designed to give employees a sense of modernity and spaciousness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nByrnes said James believed an office space should look and feel like home: \u201cA place where you wanted to spend your day, rather than a glass box with little sense of the human scale.\u201d Adam Haddow of SJB architects with Matthew Byrnes of Design 5 \u2013 Architects inside the Reader\u2019s Digest building on Waterloo Street in Surry Hills. Credit: Kate Geraghty To achieve that, James collaborated with sculptor Douglas Annand and landscape architect Bruce Mackenzie, who designed what is thought to be Australia\u2019s first rooftop garden on a commercial building. Byrnes said the approved new works would build on James\u2019 original vision. The architects planned to restore warmth, light and amenity to the building, now owned by the Barana Group, and avoid \u201cthe sterile, impersonal feel associated with commercial architecture\u201d. An article about the new Reader\u2019s Digest Building in 1967. Credit: Reprinted with permission of Reader\u2019s Digest November 1967. The project will finally install a large pile of Annand\u2019s original anthropomorphic sculptures that Byrne discovered had been banished to the building\u2019s undercroft because they were too lewd. In a self-published book on the project, architect James recalled a 5am call from a visiting Reader\u2019s Digest manager who had just flown in from the US and taken a taxi direct to the almost completed site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe man was in a towering rage,\u201d James wrote. \u201cDoug\u2019s cast iron railings, just installed on the verandas, were \u2018indecent, with a hideous sexuality\u2019 and \u2018gross insult to decent people\u2019. They were \u2018perverted\u2019.\u201d James wrote that the executive threatened: \u201cI want them removed from the building before I have showered, breakfasted and back in the building, or you are fired. I will dismiss you on the spot if those gross horrors are not removed at once.\u201d The project will also replace the rooftop garden and failing waterproof membrane. Other internal features, including those synonymous with mid-century architecture, such as the original copper artichoke pendant lights, and lift panels with chrome circular ashtrays on every floor, will be retained.

Credit: The bespoke balustrades and beautifully crafted timber handrails curled like a shepherd\u2019s crook will be polished, and the building will be updated to meet accessibility guidelines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project\u2019s goal of bringing life back to this part of Surry Hills seems direct from the pages of the Reader\u2019s Digest article about its sparkling new home in November 1967. The editors wrote that they hoped the Digest\u2019s new home would fulfil the then-mayor of Sydney\u2019s goal of bringing new life to Surry Hills, and encouraged their 610,000 Australian subscribers to visit. One of the unusual aspects of James\u2019 design was his use of the Fibonacci sequence to ensure its proportions were human in scale. Byrnes said the application of this system had been rigorous and extraordinary. \u201cThis principle formed the basis of the design and configuration of the new glazing, which are consolidated in the central three bays on Cooper and Adelaide streets, where glazing already exists.\u201d A cafe will operate on the ground floor of Cooper Street. For Haddow, the project realises an ambition and fascination with the building since he arrived in Sydney as a young architect.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The obsessive compulsive disorder. The panic attacks. The anxiety that comes from being bullied as a child. On a rainy Wednesday afternoon at an old-style pub, tucked away in a former bottle shop lined with grimy band posters for the likes of the Whitlams, Silverchair and Powderfinger, Australian actor Dacre Montgomery \u2013 of Stranger Things fame \u2013 is talking very personally. \u201cI get stuck in a channel of thought where I\u2019m locking and unlocking the door five or six times because it isn\u2019t right\u201d: Dacre Montgomery Credit: Jessica Hromas \u201cI have the lowest self-esteem ever,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m scared of everything.\u201d Once mental health was a taboo subject for just about anyone, let alone a young actor talking about a new film. It\u2019s especially unexpected given Montgomery\u2019s image since he broke through playing Billy Hargrove \u2013 an abusive student at Hawkins High and flirtatious lifeguard \u2013 in the hit Netflix series eight years ago. His moody good looks and dapper moustache made the Perth-raised actor a teen heart-throb whose Instagram fan pages have such swooning names as \u201clovelydacre\u201d and \u201cdacremontgomeryseyes\u201d. (His first name, by the way, rhymes with \u201cacre\u201d and is an old family surname.) He was on magazine covers and in fashion ads with a cool young actor image, only enhanced when he turned up on red carpets with then-model girlfriend Liv Pollock, and released a podcast setting his own beat poetry to music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis Year 12 classmates at Mount Lawley Senior High seemed to be on the money when they voted him \u201cthe most likely student to become a Hollywood star\u201d. Loading But like so much in entertainment, the image belies the reality. Montgomery didn\u2019t like where his career was heading, so he stepped back from acting for the best part of five years. After the third season of Stranger Things, when Billy becomes possessed by the malevolent Mind Flayer, he was in the 2020 romcom The Broken Hearts Gallery. He had a 2022 guest role as a hallucination in the fourth season of Stranger Things. The same year, he had a small part as concert movie director Steve Binder in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis. But Montgomery turned down so many well-paid commercial opportunities that his Hollywood agent fired him. Instead, he wanted to work on arthouse projects with auteur directors that mattered to him. \u201cA lot of real world Dacre stuff crossed the line into Jack and Elizabeth\u201d: Dacre Montgomery and Vicki Krieps in Went up the Hill. Credit: Kirsty Griffin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat he calls re-engineering his career - with a more supportive agent - seems to have worked. At 30, Montgomery is returning to the limelight with two new films this month: Australian-based Kiwi director Samuel Van Grinsven\u2019s intense drama Went up the Hill (opening in cinemas) and American Gus Van Sant\u2019s true crime drama Dead Man\u2019s Wire (premiering at the Venice International Film Festival). He has also shot two more arthouse American films and, once the last piece of the financing puzzle is in place, will make his directing debut with The Engagement Party, which he will also produce and star in. Rather than play into his former image, Montgomery wants to be upfront about exactly who he is. That means being open about his mental health. \u201cI suffer from really, really debilitating OCD,\u201d he says, tucked into a black puffer jacket under a black cap in the Old Clare Hotel on Sydney\u2019s Broadway. It\u2019s so debilitating that Montgomery has every light bulb in his home in the eastern suburbs with a geolocated timer for sunrise and sunset to control the light levels. \u201cI\u2019m really specific about light, about space, about colour,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery single skirting board, ceiling and wall is painted the same colour so I can focus. I\u2019m just very spectrum \u2026 I get stuck in a channel of thought where I\u2019m locking and unlocking the door five or six times because it isn\u2019t right.\u201d It\u2019s ironic that his Stranger Things character is a bully, because Montgomery was bullied for being heavyset as a boy. It didn\u2019t help that he was interested in drama, encouraged by parents who worked in the film industry. His dad, Scott, was a sound recordist; his mum, Judith, was a first assistant director and production co-ordinator who switched careers to become, like her father, a psychologist. Montgomery\u2019s younger sister, Saskia, is also studying to be a psychologist. \u201cI had a lot of energy and I didn\u2019t know where to funnel it, and it left me being a very unhappy kid,\u201d Montgomery says. \u201cI had a hard time. I failed drama at high school. I failed media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI went home every day, locked myself in my bedroom and just watched movie after movie, TV show after TV show, and it was my escape. I knew I wanted to be an actor but I didn\u2019t have clarity in myself and it led me to be very unhappy and very anxious a lot of the time.\u201d Montgomery now sees this anxiety is a positive in his life. \u201cIt fuels my work ethic and my ambition as a kid,\u201d he says. Dacre Montgomery as Billy in Stranger Things. Credit: Netflix I first interviewed Montgomery with Van Grinsven at the Adelaide Film Festival before the Australian premiere of Went up the Hill last year. He plays Jack, who goes to a remote home in New Zealand for the funeral of his estranged mother, Elizabeth; Vicky Krieps (The Phantom Thread) plays Jill, his mother\u2019s lover. As they get to know each other, they are alternately possessed by Elizabeth. Van Grinsven calls it a ghost story \u2013 \u201ca three-hander told with two actors\u201d. Atmospheric and poetic, it\u2019s a film about grief. Montgomery mentioned in Adelaide that shooting the film was so raw and confronting that he had a panic attack entering the brutally stark house where most of the film is set for the first time. He jumped in his car and drove to Christchurch \u2013 a response, he said, to going deep into Jack\u2019s character, playing an Australian for the first time since the start of his career and revisiting a \u201ccomplicated\u201d relationship with his father\u2019s side of the family in New Zealand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have a lot in common with Jack,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing to New Zealand \u2013 I have Kiwi family \u2013 was a bit of a pilgrimage to confront some stuff that I\u2019ve gone through \u2026 a lot of real world Dacre stuff crossed the line into Jack and Elizabeth and Went up the Hill. That led to a lot of panic attacks, a lot of meltdowns, a lot of turmoil\u201d. Van Grinsven (Sequin in a Blue Room) says he was taken aback by Montgomery\u2019s \u201cvulnerability and his honesty and how raw he was as a person\u201d in their first phone call about the film. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot Dacre the person in this character,\u201d he says. \u201cHe really is such a remarkable talent but he works from a place that\u2019s very personal to him. When the character is going through something as intense as they do in the film, sometimes understandably it gets a bit overwhelming.\u201d Dacre Montgomery, centre, with Ludi Lin, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler and Becky G in Power Rangers. Credit: AP Van Grinsven made sure his two stars decompressed after intense scenes. A fire pit at the back of the house was where they hung out to \u201ctalk about what we were dealing with in the scene and slowly come back to ourselves and what\u2019s actually happening right now\u201d. Even before Montgomery finished studying at Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), whose famous graduates include Hugh Jackman, Francis O\u2019Connor, Jai Courtney, Lisa McCune and Tim Minchin, his Hollywood career was under way. A self-tape for another project attracted interest during casting for the 2017 reboot Power Rangers. \u201cThey flew me to LA and I tested for the lead of this big franchise \u2013 four picture deal, $US100 million film \u2013 and booked the role,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very lucky. I came home, turned 21, graduated university then a couple of months later got on a plane to Canada and started my first film.\n\nAdvertisement",

About 37 per cent of people who were part of the study and reported using smartphones on the toilet spent more than five minutes per bathroom visit compared with 7 per cent of non-users.\n\nAfter adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), fibre intake, physical activity and straining, smartphone use was associated with a 46 per cent higher risk of haemorrhoids.\n\nSitting on the toilet scrolling through your phone for prolonged periods can place you at a higher risk of developing haemorrhoids.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Adorned with \u201cindecent\u201d sculptures, Sydney\u2019s idiosyncratic Reader\u2019s Digest building has confounded the public since it was unveiled in 1967 as an idealistic Mad Men-esque workplace. It was conceived as art as architecture. Or architecture as art. And its fans say it may just be the most fabulously ugly thing you\u2019ve ever seen. SJB director Adam Haddow loves the way its architect John James married an obsession with Gothic architecture with Brutalism. \u201cI call it Beaut-alism,\u201d Haddow said. Haddow\u2019s SJB and architect Matthew Byrnes of Design 5 \u2013 Architects have unveiled plans for a $23 million adaptive reuse project to start later this year. It will turn the 4200-square-metre heritage-listed building in Waterloo Street into a \u201choney pot for creative activity\u201d in Surry Hills. The Reader\u2019s Digest building in Surry Hills. Credit: \u201cIt should become the Surry Hills Town Hall, emotionally at least, because there isn\u2019t one \u2013 unless you count the Clock Hotel,\u201d said Haddow, who lives a five-minute walk away. Built to house the Reader\u2019s Digest\u2019s state-of-the-art $1 million computer that was the size of a small home, and its ground-floor printing presses, the offices were designed to give employees a sense of modernity and spaciousness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nByrnes said James believed an office space should look and feel like home: \u201cA place where you wanted to spend your day, rather than a glass box with little sense of the human scale.\u201d Adam Haddow of SJB architects with Matthew Byrnes of Design 5 \u2013 Architects inside the Reader\u2019s Digest building on Waterloo Street in Surry Hills. Credit: Kate Geraghty To achieve that, James collaborated with sculptor Douglas Annand and landscape architect Bruce Mackenzie, who designed what is thought to be Australia\u2019s first rooftop garden on a commercial building. Byrnes said the approved new works would build on James\u2019 original vision. The architects planned to restore warmth, light and amenity to the building, now owned by the Barana Group, and avoid \u201cthe sterile, impersonal feel associated with commercial architecture\u201d. An article about the new Reader\u2019s Digest Building in 1967. Credit: Reprinted with permission of Reader\u2019s Digest November 1967. The project will finally install a large pile of Annand\u2019s original anthropomorphic sculptures that Byrne discovered had been banished to the building\u2019s undercroft because they were too lewd. In a self-published book on the project, architect James recalled a 5am call from a visiting Reader\u2019s Digest manager who had just flown in from the US and taken a taxi direct to the almost completed site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe man was in a towering rage,\u201d James wrote. \u201cDoug\u2019s cast iron railings, just installed on the verandas, were \u2018indecent, with a hideous sexuality\u2019 and \u2018gross insult to decent people\u2019. They were \u2018perverted\u2019.\u201d James wrote that the executive threatened: \u201cI want them removed from the building before I have showered, breakfasted and back in the building, or you are fired. I will dismiss you on the spot if those gross horrors are not removed at once.\u201d The project will also replace the rooftop garden and failing waterproof membrane. Other internal features, including those synonymous with mid-century architecture, such as the original copper artichoke pendant lights, and lift panels with chrome circular ashtrays on every floor, will be retained.

Credit: The bespoke balustrades and beautifully crafted timber handrails curled like a shepherd\u2019s crook will be polished, and the building will be updated to meet accessibility guidelines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project\u2019s goal of bringing life back to this part of Surry Hills seems direct from the pages of the Reader\u2019s Digest article about its sparkling new home in November 1967. The editors wrote that they hoped the Digest\u2019s new home would fulfil the then-mayor of Sydney\u2019s goal of bringing new life to Surry Hills, and encouraged their 610,000 Australian subscribers to visit. One of the unusual aspects of James\u2019 design was his use of the Fibonacci sequence to ensure its proportions were human in scale. Byrnes said the application of this system had been rigorous and extraordinary. \u201cThis principle formed the basis of the design and configuration of the new glazing, which are consolidated in the central three bays on Cooper and Adelaide streets, where glazing already exists.\u201d A cafe will operate on the ground floor of Cooper Street. For Haddow, the project realises an ambition and fascination with the building since he arrived in Sydney as a young architect.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The obsessive compulsive disorder. The panic attacks. The anxiety that comes from being bullied as a child. On a rainy Wednesday afternoon at an old-style pub, tucked away in a former bottle shop lined with grimy band posters for the likes of the Whitlams, Silverchair and Powderfinger, Australian actor Dacre Montgomery \u2013 of Stranger Things fame \u2013 is talking very personally. \u201cI get stuck in a channel of thought where I\u2019m locking and unlocking the door five or six times because it isn\u2019t right\u201d: Dacre Montgomery Credit: Jessica Hromas \u201cI have the lowest self-esteem ever,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m scared of everything.\u201d Once mental health was a taboo subject for just about anyone, let alone a young actor talking about a new film. It\u2019s especially unexpected given Montgomery\u2019s image since he broke through playing Billy Hargrove \u2013 an abusive student at Hawkins High and flirtatious lifeguard \u2013 in the hit Netflix series eight years ago. His moody good looks and dapper moustache made the Perth-raised actor a teen heart-throb whose Instagram fan pages have such swooning names as \u201clovelydacre\u201d and \u201cdacremontgomeryseyes\u201d. (His first name, by the way, rhymes with \u201cacre\u201d and is an old family surname.) He was on magazine covers and in fashion ads with a cool young actor image, only enhanced when he turned up on red carpets with then-model girlfriend Liv Pollock, and released a podcast setting his own beat poetry to music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis Year 12 classmates at Mount Lawley Senior High seemed to be on the money when they voted him \u201cthe most likely student to become a Hollywood star\u201d. Loading But like so much in entertainment, the image belies the reality. Montgomery didn\u2019t like where his career was heading, so he stepped back from acting for the best part of five years. After the third season of Stranger Things, when Billy becomes possessed by the malevolent Mind Flayer, he was in the 2020 romcom The Broken Hearts Gallery. He had a 2022 guest role as a hallucination in the fourth season of Stranger Things. The same year, he had a small part as concert movie director Steve Binder in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis. But Montgomery turned down so many well-paid commercial opportunities that his Hollywood agent fired him. Instead, he wanted to work on arthouse projects with auteur directors that mattered to him. \u201cA lot of real world Dacre stuff crossed the line into Jack and Elizabeth\u201d: Dacre Montgomery and Vicki Krieps in Went up the Hill. Credit: Kirsty Griffin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat he calls re-engineering his career - with a more supportive agent - seems to have worked. At 30, Montgomery is returning to the limelight with two new films this month: Australian-based Kiwi director Samuel Van Grinsven\u2019s intense drama Went up the Hill (opening in cinemas) and American Gus Van Sant\u2019s true crime drama Dead Man\u2019s Wire (premiering at the Venice International Film Festival). He has also shot two more arthouse American films and, once the last piece of the financing puzzle is in place, will make his directing debut with The Engagement Party, which he will also produce and star in. Rather than play into his former image, Montgomery wants to be upfront about exactly who he is. That means being open about his mental health. \u201cI suffer from really, really debilitating OCD,\u201d he says, tucked into a black puffer jacket under a black cap in the Old Clare Hotel on Sydney\u2019s Broadway. It\u2019s so debilitating that Montgomery has every light bulb in his home in the eastern suburbs with a geolocated timer for sunrise and sunset to control the light levels. \u201cI\u2019m really specific about light, about space, about colour,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery single skirting board, ceiling and wall is painted the same colour so I can focus. I\u2019m just very spectrum \u2026 I get stuck in a channel of thought where I\u2019m locking and unlocking the door five or six times because it isn\u2019t right.\u201d It\u2019s ironic that his Stranger Things character is a bully, because Montgomery was bullied for being heavyset as a boy. It didn\u2019t help that he was interested in drama, encouraged by parents who worked in the film industry. His dad, Scott, was a sound recordist; his mum, Judith, was a first assistant director and production co-ordinator who switched careers to become, like her father, a psychologist. Montgomery\u2019s younger sister, Saskia, is also studying to be a psychologist. \u201cI had a lot of energy and I didn\u2019t know where to funnel it, and it left me being a very unhappy kid,\u201d Montgomery says. \u201cI had a hard time. I failed drama at high school. I failed media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI went home every day, locked myself in my bedroom and just watched movie after movie, TV show after TV show, and it was my escape. I knew I wanted to be an actor but I didn\u2019t have clarity in myself and it led me to be very unhappy and very anxious a lot of the time.\u201d Montgomery now sees this anxiety is a positive in his life. \u201cIt fuels my work ethic and my ambition as a kid,\u201d he says. Dacre Montgomery as Billy in Stranger Things. Credit: Netflix I first interviewed Montgomery with Van Grinsven at the Adelaide Film Festival before the Australian premiere of Went up the Hill last year. He plays Jack, who goes to a remote home in New Zealand for the funeral of his estranged mother, Elizabeth; Vicky Krieps (The Phantom Thread) plays Jill, his mother\u2019s lover. As they get to know each other, they are alternately possessed by Elizabeth. Van Grinsven calls it a ghost story \u2013 \u201ca three-hander told with two actors\u201d. Atmospheric and poetic, it\u2019s a film about grief. Montgomery mentioned in Adelaide that shooting the film was so raw and confronting that he had a panic attack entering the brutally stark house where most of the film is set for the first time. He jumped in his car and drove to Christchurch \u2013 a response, he said, to going deep into Jack\u2019s character, playing an Australian for the first time since the start of his career and revisiting a \u201ccomplicated\u201d relationship with his father\u2019s side of the family in New Zealand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have a lot in common with Jack,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing to New Zealand \u2013 I have Kiwi family \u2013 was a bit of a pilgrimage to confront some stuff that I\u2019ve gone through \u2026 a lot of real world Dacre stuff crossed the line into Jack and Elizabeth and Went up the Hill. That led to a lot of panic attacks, a lot of meltdowns, a lot of turmoil\u201d. Van Grinsven (Sequin in a Blue Room) says he was taken aback by Montgomery\u2019s \u201cvulnerability and his honesty and how raw he was as a person\u201d in their first phone call about the film. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot Dacre the person in this character,\u201d he says. \u201cHe really is such a remarkable talent but he works from a place that\u2019s very personal to him. When the character is going through something as intense as they do in the film, sometimes understandably it gets a bit overwhelming.\u201d Dacre Montgomery, centre, with Ludi Lin, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler and Becky G in Power Rangers. Credit: AP Van Grinsven made sure his two stars decompressed after intense scenes. A fire pit at the back of the house was where they hung out to \u201ctalk about what we were dealing with in the scene and slowly come back to ourselves and what\u2019s actually happening right now\u201d. Even before Montgomery finished studying at Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), whose famous graduates include Hugh Jackman, Francis O\u2019Connor, Jai Courtney, Lisa McCune and Tim Minchin, his Hollywood career was under way. A self-tape for another project attracted interest during casting for the 2017 reboot Power Rangers. \u201cThey flew me to LA and I tested for the lead of this big franchise \u2013 four picture deal, $US100 million film \u2013 and booked the role,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very lucky. I came home, turned 21, graduated university then a couple of months later got on a plane to Canada and started my first film.\n\nAdvertisement",

As the largest in Australia, the school drives local innovation and enhances rural healthcare through international collaborations, creating a broader global impact.\n\nIts state-of-the-art facilities include various multi-purpose skills laboratories offering interactive clinical learning environments, so you\u2019re properly prepared for placements and full-time work.\n\nExperience is also essential when trying to get a job outside of uni. It\u2019s important to assess whether the university you are considering can offer you the chance to connect with professionals in your field while you study. This can set you up for long-term success.\n\nSome universities offer industry placements as elective subjects, as well as work-based learning which can help you secure a great job once you finish your studies.\n\nAt La Trobe, placements and work-based learning is supervised by industry professionals and academic co-ordinators, giving students valuable experience and networking opportunities. The university helps you connect with a diverse range of industry partners, from local companies to multinationals, which often provide a valuable foot in the door for future employment.\n\nLa Trobe was the top university for undergraduate employability in 2023, according to the QILT (Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching) survey.\n\nAlmost nine in every 10 undergraduates found a job within four months of graduating, while 93.7 per cent of undergraduates were in a full-time role three years after graduating. Employers recognise the value and quality of La Trobe graduates, with the university also ranked number one in Victoria for employer satisfaction in 2023.\n\nCast your net widely\n\nKeira Wills, the dean of learning futures at Strathcona Girls Grammar, says it\u2019s vital for prospective students to consider the industry experience being provided by different universities.\n\n\u201cPractical experience is crucial to prepare you for careers beyond university,\u201d Wills says.\n\nWe encourage all our school leavers to attend university open days to get a feel for what each university offers. Keira Wills, Strathcona Girls Grammar\n\nBe sure to investigate the overall experience provided by your future uni. While studying is the main reason you\u2019re at university, it\u2019s also a great time to take advantage of the broad options available during this exciting phase of life.\n\n\u201cFinding additional areas of passion while at university can really enrich your experience,\u201d adds Wills.\n\nMaking the most of campus life\n\nLa Trobe offers access to great amenities, including The La Trobe University Sports Park precinct at the Melbourne campus in Bundoora. The Sports Park includes a new La Trobe Sports Stadium with six high-quality, multipurpose courts, as well as a central show court for basketball, netball, volleyball and futsal. It\u2019s also the training grounds for the Australian women\u2019s national soccer team, the Matildas.\n\nThe world-class Sports Park precinct was built for both students and the wider community to enjoy, supporting the university\u2019s philosophy of making education and premium facilities more accessible to more people. Accessibility is another reason why La Trobe is made up of seven campuses, with the Melbourne City Campus, Sydney Campus and Bundoora Campus accompanied by regional campuses in Bendigo, Mildura, Albury-Wodonga and Shepparton.\n\nIf you can, it\u2019s worth touring the campuses of each university that you\u2019re considering before making a final choice. That way, you can get a feel for the university, the people that study there and the environment you\u2019ll be in, which can get you excited about your adventurous first few years after finishing school.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s important to remember that despite your ATAR results, there are a variety of pathways you can take to your dream course. Whether you take an extra year to work your way in or transfer from a different course, the doors to your future won\u2019t close \u2013 even after you receive your year 12 results.",
