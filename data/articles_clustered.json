    "text": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers will aim to protect Australian industry against the impacts of Donald Trump's tariffs when he hands down the federal budget tonight.\n\nThe dangers of a full-blown global trade war and the damage to exporters from the US president's tariffs will shape this budget, as the federal government gears up for an election in May .\n\nThe budget is expected to push a \"buy Australian\" plan to shield local businesses from the economic disruptions sparked by Trump's tariffs, reports The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers will hand down the federal budget today.. (Polly Hanning/Nine)\n\nIt will involve spending by government departments favouring Australian companies and encouraging households to buy locally.\ufeff\n\nThat goes hand in hand with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's election platform for a \"future made in Australia\".\n\nAustralian beef and pharmaceuticals are expected to be targeted in the next round of US tariffs, due to be unveiled by the White House next week.\n\nBut with one eye on the US, the treasurer has the other on delivering substantial cost-of-living relief for families in the national accounts, including extended energy rebates, ahead of the looming election.\n\nThe federal budget will also contain an extra $10.6 billion for defence spending over four years as the Trump administration pushes US allies to contribute more for their armed forces. \ufeff\n\nHere's what\ufeff you can expect today.\n\nMajor bulk-billing boost and cheaper PBS medicines\n\nHealth \ufeffhas been a significant focus for the government in the lead-up to the next election, highlighted by two major policy announcements.\n\nThe first, unveiled in February, is an $8.5 billion boost for Medicare to expand bulk billing in a policy it says will deliver 18 million extra bulk-billed GP visits each year, saving Australians a combined $859 million a year by 2030.\n\nThe second, announced just days from the budget, is a $689 million pledge to reduce the maximum cost of a majority of medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), down from $31.60 to $25\ufeff.\n\nThat second announcement, which comes as US pharmaceutical giants lobby President Donald Trump to target the PBS in a new round of tariffs, will deliver Australians combined savings of $200 million a year, according to the government, and will start on January 1, 2026.\n\nBoth policies have been backed by the opposition, so will come into effect regardless of who wins the next election.\n\nMany medicines listed on the PBS will get cheaper from January 1, 2026. (Nine)\n\nEnergy bill relief\n\nThe centrepiece of last year's budget was the $3.5 billion in energy bill relief \u2013 an automatic $300 rebate, spread over the course of the financial year, for every household in the country, and that is, as expected, being extended this year.\n\nThe policy will now run through until the end of the year, providing all Australian households with a further\ufeff $150 off their power bills , at a cost of $1.8 billion.\n\nIt comes after the national energy regulator approved price increases of up to 9 per cent from July 1.\n\nAccording to Treasury estimates, the move will reduce headline inflation by around half a percentage point, and reduce household bills by 7.5 per cent on average nationally.\n\nWhile the opposition slammed the move as a \"desperate act\" and a \"Ponzi scheme\", it also promised to support the move so, once again, it will be implemented regardless of the election result.\n\nThe government says the extension of energy relief will reduce household bills by 7.5 per cent. (Luis Enrique Ascui/The Age)\n\nBoost for Australian-made goods as tariffs hit\n\nOne of the big economic uncertainties plaguing financial markets at the moment is US President Donald Trump's explosion of tariffs.\n\nAustralia has been hit by Trump's 25 per cent \ufefftax on all steel and aluminium imported into the United States, and while we shouldn't expect a retaliatory tariff in the budget \u2013 that was ruled out by Albanese \u2013 there's set to be some kind of response.\n\nLocal manufacturers fear a flood of cheap, international produce onto the Australian market from all the other nations that have also been denied free access to American consumers, which would be a significant business challenge.\n\nAlbanese has flagged support for local industry will be handed down.\n\n\"In the March budget, we'll provide additional support for our 'Buy Australian' campaign which we'll be announcing as part of the budget process,\" the prime minister said in his press conference responding to the introduction of Trump's tariffs.\n\nA couple of days later, he gave another hint on the topics.\n\n\"We have great products and as part of the budget in a couple of weeks' time, you'll see a spiced-up Made in Australia Plan\ufeff,\" he said.\n\nExpect to see incentives for Australians to buy locally made products after Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs. (AAP)\n\nA budget deficit\n\n\ufeffAfter two straight years of surpluses, the budget will return to the red in 2025.\n\n\ufeffThis has been flagged for quite some time; last year's surplus was always forecast to be followed by a return to deficit. (To put things into context, 2023 and 2024 are the only two surpluses Australia has recorded since 2008.)\n\nWhile we don't know what the exact figure will be, in December's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO), Treasury was forecasting a deficit of $26.9 billion in this year's budget.\n\nA week before budget day, Chalmers said that figure will be pretty close to the mark.\n\n\"Revenue upgrades have actually come off very significantly since the highs of October 2022,\" he said.\n\n\"Treasury doesn't expect the bottom line this year or over the forward estimates to change very substantially from MYEFO.\"\ufeff\n\nChalmers has flagged the deficit is likely to be in the mid-$20 billions. (Alex Ellinghausen/SMH)\n\nMassive student debt discount\n\nThe roughly 3 million Australians who have student debt will get a welcome boost on June 1 when \ufefftheir outstanding balances are cut by 20 per cent .\n\nThe one-off discount represents a massive $16 billion in student debt reduction \u2013 more than five times larger than last year's move to retrospectively lower the indexation applied to those debts.\n\nThe new measure was announced by the government as an election promise in November, and will now need to be included in this year's budget.\n\nAll Australians with student debt will get a big saving following the budget. (Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\nSubsidised childcare for everyone\ufeff\n\nLike\ufeff the student debt discount, this was an election promise unveiled in late 2024, well after the last budget: three days a week of subsidised childcare to families with a combined income of less than $530,000 a year.\n\nThe activity test will also be scrapped to make it easier for low-income parents to access cheaper childcare, a measure recommended by the Productivity Commission and long called for by economists.\n\nThe policy will come into effect on January 1, 2026, if Labor wins the federal election, and will cost $427 million over five years.\n\nAlbanese and Education Minister Jason Clare (right) unveiled the childcare changes last year. (Paul Jeffers/The Age)\n\nOther announcements \ufeff\n\nThere are a number of other policies that will form a part of the 2025 federal budget, including:\n\nA new $1 billion fund to build and expand early education centres\ufeff\n\n$1 billion \ufeffto reserve land for a future rail line linking Western Sydney Airport with south-west Sydney suburbs\n\n$30 million for the restoration of the Adass Israel Synagogue, which was firebombed last year, as well as a further $1.2 million for security upgrades.\ufeff\n\n$2.9 million to help grocery suppliers \"stand up\" to Woolworths and Coles.\n\nA $44.5 million boost for Australia's intelligence capabilities to implement the recommendations of an independent review.\n\n$800 million to expand the eligibility criteria for the Help to Buy shared equity housing scheme .\n\n\ufeff$54 million to boost the prefabricated home construction industry.",

    "text": "Cheap vehicles, growing market share, a new super-fast charger \u2014 Chinese electric vehicle company BYD is taking the fight to Tesla, as the American EV maker's global sales slump.\n\nThe company made $170 billion in revenue in 2024, which beat market analysts' predictions and soared past Tesla's annual revenue of $155.5 billion.\n\nBYD reported a 73 per cent surge in net profit to a record $3.3 billion for the fourth quarter last year.\n\nThe company's Hong Kong-listed shares are up more than 50 per cent since the start of January and hit a record high last week.\n\nBYD plans to roll out 4,000 of the superchargers across China before installing them overseas. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick )\n\nThe Chinese car maker is on track to dominate the EV market \u2014 its overseas shipments jumped almost 72 per cent last year, making up 10 per cent of its overall car sales, indicating its growing relevance outside of China.\n\nThe company has also announced it wants to build a third European plant, this time in Germany.\n\nGraeme Hughes from Griffith University said BYD out-performing Tesla was the result of a combination of increased hate towards Elon Musk and BYD's rapid expansion.\n\n\"Elon Musk's star power had originally helped with Tesla sales. The UK market alone has dropped 45 per cent in the last month, people are concerned not only by what [Elon Musk] is doing but what [his actions] means about them,\" he said.\n\nDe-badging, re-badging, and even destroying Tesla cars have become more common as owners shun the Tesla brand.\n\nMeanwhile, BYD has been heavily investing in its manufacturing processes, Mr Hughes said, to vastly improve its product from where it was just a few years ago.\n\n\"The evolution has happened quite rapidly so they've been investing a significant amount of money back into their platforms,\" Mr Hughes said.\n\n\"It's [EVs] becoming a robust ecosystem, we have substantial players in the market. Both historical gasoline players and the new evolution of the Teslas and the BYDs. We're going to see further growth in this space over the next 10 years in particular.\"\n\nSuper-fast charging to rival Tesla\n\nIts latest financial result come after BYD announced new charging technology that promises to fully power EVs in as little time as it takes to fill up a petrol car.\n\nBYD claims its new Super e-Platform will reach peak charging speeds of 1,000 kilowatts, giving a vehicle enough power to travel 400 kilometres within five minutes.\n\nThat charging speed is twice as fast as the current fastest charging technology on the market \u2014 Tesla's superchargers.\n\nBYD's market capitalisation remains smaller than Tesla's which currently sits at $US800 billion. (AP: David Zalubowski, File)\n\nBYD founder Wang Chuanfu said his company had been developing the technology to ease charging anxiety.\n\n\"We have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,\" he said.\n\n\" This is the first time in the industry that the unit of megawatt (charge) has been achieved on charging power. \"\n\n'Dump Tesla': Protests target showrooms as sales slump hits stock Photo shows People holding protest signs about Tesla and Elon Musk outside a Tesla showroom. From protests at more than 50 Tesla showrooms across the US, and bumper stickers on Australian Teslas from embarrassed owners, to cheeky UK bus stop advertisements critical of boss Elon Musk \u2014 the criticism and condemnation appears to be gathering pace.\n\nCharging something as big as a car in 5 minutes expels an enormous amount of heat, and BYD claims it's getting around this with an \"all liquid-cooled megawatt flash charging terminal system\", which manages the heat when charging so battery life isn't affected and ensures it's safe.\n\nThe ultra-fast technology will only be available on two new BYD models hitting the market in April that will have batteries designed to handle such fast charging speeds.\n\nAbout 4,000 of the chargers will be rolled out in China first.\n\nUntil now, BYD owners have relied on other automakers' charging facilities or those run by third parties to charge their vehicles.\n\nWhile the development is a sign the EV infrastructure war is heating up, it has also added pressure on Tesla.\n\nFive-minute charging 'significant hurdle' for grid\n\nStephen Bragg, the lead partner for motor energy industry services at Pitcher Partners told the ABC BYD's new tech was \"a big deal\".\n\n\"It's very encouraging, one of the biggest issues with electric vehicles is the recharging time,\" he said.\n\n\"I think one of the big drawbacks of owning an EV is you have to think about your trip, you have to plan things out, you have to work out if you can charge, so if you could charge the car in five minutes \u2026 it becomes quite compelling.\"\n\nWhile it's great for China, the superchargers are unlikely to hit Aussie shores for a while. (AAP: Supplied)\n\nMr Bragg said the fastest chargers in Australia currently charge a car in about 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n\"But those require a significant amount of infrastructure, their own substation and direct line, and they cost about a million dollars. It's a very expensive exercise to achieve 30 minutes or 20 minutes.\n\n\"To do five minutes it would be unheard of in Australia, at least at the moment. If everyone started to come and charge their batteries in five minutes, you could just imagine the amount of electricity required into the grid.\n\n\" To generate that much electricity would be a significant hurdle to get over. \"\n\nMr Bragg said someone charging an EV in five minutes with Australia's current infrastructure would black out an entire suburb \"because it would just take all the electricity on the system\".\n\n\"There's still a long way to go. One thing that's difficult to do in Australia is build infrastructure so\u2026 a lot of hype and good hope, if it's true. But until [there's] mass adoption, it doesn't really shift the needle.\"\n\nBYD 'breakthrough' could be used by other EV players\n\nSeth Goldstein, chief financial analyst at Morningstar, said the BYD's new battery that can charge in five minutes was a breakthrough that would eliminate the longer charge times that many current EVs have and would make charging take just as long as pumping petrol would have \"little impact\" on Tesla.\n\n\"Tesla and BYD competitors should either be working on their own solution to offer a charge below 10 minutes or look to license the technology from BYD,\" Mr Goldstein said.\n\nTesla is also working on ultra-fast charging \u2014 its current offering can add 270 kilometres of range in 15 minutes on a 500-kilowatt charger.\n\nLoading...\n\nMercedes Benz has unveiled that its upcoming EV, can get 325 kilometres of range in 10 minutes.\n\n\"I see this as positive for BYD. They also sell batteries, so companies like Tesla, who already buy batteries from BYD, could buy the new batteries, which would reduce the impact of BYD's new batteries on Tesla sales,\" Mr Goldstein said.\n\n\"Tesla continues to reduce their charge time. We estimate Tesla's new charge time will be 10 to 12 minutes \u2014 a big improvement versus today, but still slower than BYD.\"\n\nMr Goldstein also said what would see Tesla lead the way again in EVs would be the roll out of its superior self-driving technology. Elon Musk has said the technology would be fully autonomous this year.",

    "text": "With an expected decade of deficits on the horizon, Treasurer Jim Chalmers will try to convince voters that Tuesday's federal budget manages to balance the need to keep a lid on spending while giving struggling households enough support.\n\nAnother key pillar of Mr Chalmers' fourth budget as treasurer will be shoring up Australia's economic \"resilience\" in the face of rising global uncertainty, most notably the spectre of further tariffs under United States President Donald Trump.\n\nAfter two federal budget surpluses, this time the treasurer will have to sell a deficit of around $26.9 billion, with an election looming just around the corner.\n\nBut while the Coalition has accused Labor of handing down a \"budget for five weeks\" \u2014 referring to the length of an election campaign \u2014 Mr Chalmers described it as a responsible budget that will help with the cost of living while setting up Australia's future.\n\nDoing the media rounds on Tuesday morning, the treasurer touted the previous surpluses and an $207 billion turnaround in the budget's fortunes, while playing down expectations of any big surprises.\n\n\"We've delivered two surpluses, we've shrunk the deficit for this year, we've engineered that $207 billion improvement \u2014 that means less debt and less debt interest at the same time,\" he said outside an entrance to Parliament House in Canberra.\n\n\"So that we can make room to strengthen Medicare and help with the cost of living and build Australia's future as well.\"\n\nWhile Mr Chalmers and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have identified cost of living as the number one issue in the mind of voters, and therefore a focus of the budget, most if not all of their key support measures have already been announced, including boosts to Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\n\nLoading...\n\nOver the weekend the government announced an extension to the energy bill relief scheme, meaning another $150 for all households at a cost of about $1.8 billion over the forward estimates.\n\nBut he would not be drawn on whether it will become a permanent feature of budgets going forward, if the government is re-elected in May.\n\n\"From budget to budget, we review the cost-of-living policies to make sure that we're doing what we meaningfully can to help people in the most responsible way,\" he said.\n\nThe energy bill relief, along with other previously announced measures, have already been provisioned for in the budget.\n\n'Make the economy more resilient' is the contingency\n\nAnother \"defining feature\" of the budget, which the treasurer was keen to stress on Tuesday, is shoring up Australia's economic resilience amid what he called \"global economic uncertainty\".\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to announce a new wave of reciprocal tariffs next week on April 2 \u2014 which they have labelled \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 with fears several key exports could be impacted.\n\nWhat's in the pre-election federal budget? Photo shows The front of a budget book with a navy cover and Australian government logo printed on it that says \"Budget 2025-26\". It was the federal budget that almost didn't happen, but the government is set to deliver its fourth budget tonight before voters head to the polls by mid-May. Here's every announcement that we already know about.\n\nIn response, Mr Chalmers foreshadowed that there would be \"a little bit of funding\" to promote a new \"Buy Australia\" campaign, alongside investments in green metals.\n\n\"We're a very trade exposed country. We're not uniquely impacted by these tariffs out of Washington DC, but we've got a lot of skin in the game,\" he said.\n\n\"And so what the budget will be about in addition to helping with the cost of living and strengthening Medicare, it will also be about making us more resilient to these external shocks.\"\n\nAsked if there was a contingency in the budget to deal with any unexpected tariff announcements, the treasurer said the plan was to \"make the economy more resilient\".\n\n\"When we talk about building Australia's future, what we're really talking about is making our economy more competitive and dynamic and productive but also more resilient,\" he said.\n\n\" Now this is a new world of uncertainty, and the budget will be a platform for prosperity in that new global context. \"\n\nCoalition paints a dire picture\n\nAfter Australia's bottom line is revealed when Mr Chalmers stands up in the House of Representatives this evening, attention will turn to the Coalition who will be under pressure to provide details of how they plan to cut back on Labor's spending.\n\nThe Coalition has already agreed to match many of the government's key measures, including an $8.5 billion lift on Medicare.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Parliament House on Tuesday morning, Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor painted a grim picture of the economy.\n\nHe said the situation was \"dire for Australian households\" who are struggling to put food on the table; the economy was a \"complete and utter disaster\"; and that there had been an \"absolute loss of hope\" amongst people keen to buy a house or pay off their mortgage.\n\nMr Taylor also attacked the treasurer, who he said \"doesn't understand economics\".\n\nOne of the Coalition's key messages in recent weeks has been their plan to cut waste in the public service, which Mr Taylor returned to on Tuesday.\n\n\"You don't need to have a bigger team to have a better team and I've got to say that this treasurer seems to think the exact opposite,\" he said.\n\nAs for Mr Chalmers' focus on resilience, Mr Taylor added: \"The only resilience this bloke wants is at the election. That's all he cares about. This is a budget for the next five weeks.\"",

    "text": "Recommendations made by Australia's consumer watchdog could even the playing field between farmers and supermarkets but not everyone is convinced.\n\nLast year the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) conducted an inquiry into the nation's supermarket sector.\n\nThe purpose was to examine the pricing practices of the supermarkets and the relationship between wholesale, farmgate and retail prices.\n\nOne of the main findings was that many farmers and suppliers are dependent on Coles and Woolworths for their viability.\n\nA Woolworths' aisle showing half-price products for sale. (AAP: Darren England)\n\nThe inquiry's final report listed 20 recommendations to address this power imbalance.\n\nThey included clearer pricing practices, greater transparency for suppliers and reforms to planning and zoning laws; all designed to address \"market failures\" and offer suppliers fairer bargaining conditions.\n\nIncreased transparency for farmers\n\nThe ACCC described the situation facing suppliers as a \"monopsony\", where there is effectively only one buyer for their products, who can leverage their buying power to get lower wholesale prices.\n\nUnder the recommendations, Woolworths, Coles and Aldi would be required to send the price they paid for fruit and vegetables to an independent body weekly, and they wouldn't be allowed to change the price or volume of produce after a purchase order had been confirmed.\n\nQueensland Fruit and Vegetable Growers chief executive Rachel Chambers said she was happy to see greater transparency.\n\nRachel Chambers says the report calls for more transparency.

    "text": "When my husband and I eloped in December 2020, we promised ourselves that we'd have a big party later.\n\nWe hurried to marry because we wanted to start a family. I didn't realise I was traditional until it became imperative for me to do one before the other. \"If we're creating life\", I told my confused partner, \"I need the paperwork legally binding us together\".\n\nWe didn't know when \"later\" would be, given the pandemic. Charlie's immediate family was in Victoria but mine were beyond the closed borders in Western Australia and Sri Lanka. I didn't know when I'd see them for a hug, let alone a party.\n\nSo, we eloped. Then we blinked and three brutal years of newlywed life flew past, with the ongoing pandemic, miscarriages, my father's death, IVF and the unique overwhelm of living in a house while renovating it.\n\nPlanning a party free from tradition\n\nThe couple performed John Farnham's Two Strong Hearts in place of a first dance. (Supplied: Sashi Perera)\n\nAfter our fourth miscarriage, Charlie and I decided to manufacture some joy and started planning a definitely-not-wedding party. When we emailed the invites, we made it clear that this was just a party and no overseas or interstate guests were obligated to come.\n\nTo our surprise, and my social-anxiety ridden horror, most RSVPed yes.\n\nABC Lifestyle Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nI went into a tailspin. As an eight-time bridesmaid, I knew that even as a fake bride, there were many meticulous details to plan. Then Charlie reminded me that there were no traditions for this party. We were already married, we could do whatever we wanted.\n\nSo, we did away with perfection and focused on what was important to us; good food, booze, dancing and a lot of fun. We had only two must-haves, Sri Lankan food (mine) and a live band (his).\n\nCharlie and Sashi were accompanied by family as they entered the room. (Supplied: Nick Robertson)\n\nThere would be no bridal party. Two of our favourite people would conduct a not-wedding ceremony. The guests would decorate an arch on arrival, which we expected to go terribly wrong but be funny.\n\nCharlie and I would walk in with both of our families, the kids with bubble guns. We'd ditch a wedding dance in favour of a duet of an 80s banger with the band (Two Strong Hearts by John Farnham, complete with dance moves), who would go on to play only 80s bangers.\n\nSo much more than a party\n\nSashi and her husband Charlie exchange vows at their not-wedding party. (Supplied: Nick Robertson)\n\nGiven much of the planning was around 80s bangers, I was stunned that the actual event felt like so much more than a party, even after being married for four years.\n\nMy whole extended family descended into Melbourne days earlier, so that both families could fill our home the night before the not-wedding. It was surreal to have them together under our newly stable roof.\n\nMy family who I had deeply missed and hadn't all been together since 2018. Plus there were my in-laws, the best one can ask for and the reason life was bearable when the borders were closed.\n\nBudget-friendly love Photo shows Bride and groom in white surrounded by their three kids also in white. Victorian couples are jumping on a trend for smaller, cheaper weddings as the cost of living eats into budgets.\n\nBeing able to get dressed-up with my family was something I didn't take for granted. The ceremony, planned as a lark, was oddly emotional under an inexplicably beautiful arch. Charlie and I swapped rings for the first time, one detail we had kept for when everyone we loved was present.\n\nWe made new vows in the presence of so many and they felt different. The first vows were punts on a future that held far more grief than we could have foreseen. And here we still were, holding each other's gazes with love, hope and promises.\n\nSomething changed that night\n\nGuests shared stories about the couple from their younger years. (Supplied: Sashi Perera)\n\nIn the lead-up to the not-wedding, I was overwhelmed by the generosity of everyone in our lives. Friends helped with the bar, and family found the caterer, paid for the suppliers and helped with the set up and pack down.\n\nThe evening was a carousel of so many different parts of our lives coming together. Speeches by our parents (minus my father, who was in every smile I saw) and our siblings coloured in many parts of our lives unknown to the other. Friends from our past and present worlds collided. I wore flats the whole evening.\n\nIt was a long overdue win with many after parties, where guests got lost between them. There were no cons, apart from the Fitzroy North residents who called the police at 9pm on a Saturday evening because the music was too loud.\n\nAside from those ding dongs, there was a key takeaway for me. Charlie and I were so determined to start a family, the weight of failure was a constant ache in my soul. But there, in front of my eyes, were all the branches of all the trees that we were already part of.\n\nI felt the ache lift that night. It has become much lighter since.\n\nSashi Perera is a comedian, writer and former lawyer based in Naarm/Melbourne. Find her on Instagram and Substack.",

    "text": "Daly Cherry-Evans sat in front of the cameras and explained the decision which reverberated through rugby league like a shock-wave \u2014 that he would be leaving the Manly Sea Eagles.\n\nHe chose his words carefully and his speech was polished as he attempted to wade through the muddy waters of a high-profile exit.\n\nHe spoke about his family, about his regret that any of this was played out in the media at all and said there was no bad blood between him and the club he'd represented with such distinction.\n\n\"I have been trying to do it in my own time with the respect of my team-mates. That was a very unfortunate situation I can't change,\" Cherry-Evans said.\n\nCherry-Evans confirms desire to leave Manly after rejecting latest offer Photo shows Daly Cherry-Evans points with his left hand Manly will be without its captain from next season onwards as Daly Cherry-Evans goes public with his desire to leave the only NRL club he has ever known.\n\n\"I know in myself I have done nothing wrong. I can only hope I haven't offended my team-mates.\"\n\nOnly this is not on Channel Nine on Monday night, it is almost ten years ago to the week, on a Fox League show that doesn't exist anymore, and it's to explain a move which, in the end, never happened.\n\nThose months which began 2015 were furious and wild times, as Manly tried to perform some salary cap wizardry that would help them keep both Cherry-Evans and halves partner Kieran Foran.\n\nAfter a summer of speculation, Cherry-Evans signed with the Gold Coast Titans in March of that year only to backflip on the deal in June and sign a contract with Manly which has gone on to define a decade for both player and club.\n\nIt went for eight years, the longest commitment on record at the time, and it seemed too ambitious to possibly work given sporting fortunes can rise and fall by the week with whip-snap quickness.\n\nBut the longer time went on and as Cherry-Evans proved time and again to be rugby league's ultimate survivor, the better the deal became, enough for Manly to extend it another two years in 2023.\n\nHalfback is the most volatile position in football. Teams can spend decades wandering through the playmaking wilderness trying to find a saviour and even when they find one there's no way of knowing how long it will last.\n\nIn that kind of landscape, stability and consistency is invaluable and that, more than anything else, is what Cherry-Evans has given Manly all these years.\n\nApart from the 2021 season, where the set restart rule juiced up attacking numbers across the board, Cherry-Evans has accumulated between 15 and 25 try assists every campaign since his debut year in 2011.\n\nThat year he became the first rookie halfback to win a premiership in 33 years, playing with a composure and class that belied his inexperience. Over the years the team and sport around him has changed face multiple times, but his own precision and poise has never wavered.\n\nCherry-Evans is one of the most consistent players in recent NRL history. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer )\n\nPicking the best or worst year of his career is an arduous task for all but the most committed Manly tragics because, in the most complimentary way possible, they all look so similar.\n\nHe does not seem to age, barely misses games and jokes about playing forever, which is funny until you realise some part of him really might be serious about it.\n\nCherry-Evans is the oldest player in the league this year but is still a top five halfback by any reasonable standard as his game shows little signs of aging or stagnation.\n\nShould he wish it, he'll remain an automatic selection for the Queensland Origin side and if he does saddle up in Maroon again this year, he will become the oldest player in Origin history.\n\nThe longevity and consistency would be astounding at any position and even though careers are getting longer, especially for halfbacks, it still stands out \u2014 by the end of this season, Cherry-Evans will have started more games at that position than any other player in the history of the sport in this country.\n\nWhy Daly Cherry-Evans is rugby league's ultimate survivor Photo shows A man celebrates a rugby league victory At 33, Daly Cherry-Evans might only be one more series loss away from his last game for Queensland \u2013 but if the decider was anything to go by, the Maroons' skipper isn't going anywhere.\n\nHis place in the history of the club is indelible. He's not just the most-capped player in their long history, he's the last active NRL player to win a premiership with the Sea Eagles. Unless the club farewells him with a grand final victory, season 2026 will be the first time in almost 40 years that Manly begin a season with someone who has won a grand final with the club on their books.\n\nManly CEO Tony Mestrov's comments on Tuesday indicate the club is still holding out hope that Cherry-Evans will do another backflip towards the Sea Eagles and accept the two-year contract he's been offered, shows the club understands what they stand to lose.\n\nThat deal they arranged back in 2015 ended up giving them one of the best players in team history because what they bought for all that money all those years ago was a consistency that would border on robotic if it wasn't so good to watch.\n\nCherry-Evans has been a certainty in an uncertain business, a solid foundation in a world of quicksand. There will be no shortage of clubs who crave exactly that and, should the 36-year old want to play on, the scramble for his services will be just as wild as it was ten years ago.\n\nAlready speculation reigns about his family links to Redcliffe and how it could inform a move to the Dolphins, his suitability to swan in at the Roosters or Bulldogs in a Cronk-style sprint for another premiership or the possibility of cashing in to take charge of the rebuilding Dragons.\n\nAll that seems sure is that if Cherry-Evans wants to play on, he will have that chance. He's said repeatedly he wants his football to do the talking and now he has the luxury of taking his time with a decision, so the end of his career will take on whatever shape he wants. That's what 15 years of consistency can buy you.\n\nManly, having lost their navigator, are also off the edge of the map. The initial report on his decision mentioned discussion of Tom Trbojevic moving to five-eighth and Lehi Hopoate taking over at fullback.\n\nABC NRL Daily podcast Photo shows ABC NRL Daily Podcast Host Darcie McDonald is joined by former NRL winger Josh Mansour to bring you your daily dose of NRL conversation. The team give you context and depth beyond the headlines in this footy conversation that's equal parts thoughtful, insightful and fun.\n\nThe club is excited about young halves prospects Joey Walsh and Onitoni Large. With the money freed up from Cherry-Evans salary, they could try and swing their weight around in the player market.\n\nBut positional switches can fail, even for a player as gifted as Trbojevic. Young players, even those as heralded as Walsh and Large, don't always kick on and signing quality, established halves has become the most expensive pastime in rugby league.\n\nCherry-Evans has been such a constant presence that it's not so much that it was hard to imagine what a Sea Eagles team without him would look like, it just didn't seem worth the time to think about.\n\nNow, Manly are replacing the dominant playing figure of their recent history as the rock on which everything maroon and white has been built on for the past ten years has vanished beneath the shifting sands.\n\nThe light of the club's guiding star is fading and for the first time in years the path is unclear and once you get lost in the tall grass, stumbling around in the dark and searching for a halfback who can lead the way out, it can take so long to find your way again.",

In his next over, he then clouted Starc for four, six and four in successive balls before the left-armer was doubtless relieved to be taken out of the firing line.\n\nWhen he returned later, Starc found the right length as he ended up taking two wickets in his last over and finished with 3-42, a good recovery after his early mauling.\n\nMitchell Starc picked up three wickets as the Delhi Capitals sealed a one-wicket win in an instant IPL classic. (AP Photo: Surjeet Yadav)\n\nMarsh, who is still not fit enough for bowling duties and is in the side as a specialist batter, must have delighted his Lucknow coach Justin Langer as he went on to reach his 50 off 21 balls.\n\nHe hit six sixes and as many fours in his pulverising knock, the giant scoreboard even flashing up \"To Planet Marsh!\" and \"Marsh Mayhem!\" after one maximum sailed out the ground.\n\nClearly enjoying every minute, Marsh, who could yet prove a bargain as a $635,000 capture for Lucknow, grinned on TV after his knock: \"Life's good mate \u2026 no bowling!\"\n\nBut life's not so good at the minute for Jake Fraser-McGurk, last year's Delhi sensation who's been struggling for form and confidence, and sidelined by Australia's selectors.\n\nAs the home side began their chase, the young Aussie holed out for one off the second ball he faced, skying an attempted monster hit off Shardul Thakur.\n\nAAP",

(AAP: Bianca De Marchi )\n\nWhilst the dream of a Rosehill mini-city would also take many years to come to fruition, its approval would represent tangible progress in tackling one of the state's biggest problems.\n\nBut having ruled out acquiring the land compulsorily, Mr Minns could see that opportunity slip through his fingers.\n\nGovernment wounded by war over wages\n\nThe premier came to power promising a fair deal for public sector workers after 12 years of wage suppression.\n\nHe immediately scrapped the Coalition's wages cap, and the government has since awarded big pay rises to paramedics and police.\n\nTeachers were also given an historic pay rise, which the government says has helped drive down vacancies.\n\nThe Minns government claims the pay rise awarded to teachers has helped to drive down vacancies. (Twitter: @Chris Minns)\n\nHowever, the government's long-running pay dispute with nurses has become increasingly bitter.\n\nSome of the same nurses who campaigned for Minns's election now protest outside parliament, yelling \"shame\" while suggesting his government is guilty of \"misogyny\" against a female-dominated workforce.\n\nThe dispute not only affects staff morale, it impacts patients. Industrial action in November resulted in about 700 surgeries being rescheduled.\n\nA similar pay dispute with public psychiatrists resulted in a mass resignation, putting an already depleted workforce \u2014 and emergency departments \u2014 under even greater strain.\n\nAnd the ongoing war with the rail unions has resulted in widespread delays and cancellations, as the network was crippled by industrial action.\n\nThe government's ongoing pay dispute with the rail unions has caused major delays and cancellations on the network. (ABC News: Joanne Babbage)\n\nSydney Trains has not met its 92 per cent on-time running benchmarks in a single month since January last year.\n\nWhile the government argues that giving into \"excessive\" pay demands would blow a hole in the budget, the drawn out nature of the disputes has affected services that voters most rely on.\n\n'No lap of honour'\n\nThe first few months of 2025 have been especially bruising for the Minns government.\n\nOn top of disruptive industrial action, the premier lost one of his most senior ministers, Jo Haylen, who resigned over her use of a government driver for a private winery excursion. It was within the rules, but by her own admission, it was beyond the pale.\n\nThe resignation of senior minister Jo Haylen was another blow for the premier. (ABC News: Nick Dole)\n\nAnd he's since faced accusations his hate-speech legislation was pushed through parliament on a false premise, after a spate of antisemitic attacks were later linked to organised crime.\n\nMinns vehemently denies the accusation, arguing that regardless of the motivations, Sydney's Jewish community was living in fear and therefore needed protection.\n\n'Acted out of fear': MP questions NSW antisemitic laws Photo shows Rod Roberts wearing suit and tie in park An MP says NSW parliament was \"misled\" after passing hate speech laws targeting antisemitism after a caravan filled with explosives was revealed to be a hoax.\n\nAfter a shaky start to the year, he will need to steady his government as it attempts to tackle one of its biggest challenges yet: toll reform.\n\nEarly in his term, the premier capped personal tolls at $60 a week and commissioned a wide-ranging review which recommended two-way tolling on the Harbour Bridge, harbour tunnel and eastern distributor, along with an entirely new pricing structure.\n\nNearly nine months have passed since the final report was released and the government is still deciding how it will respond.\n\n\"We've got a lot in front of us,\" Mr Minns said on Monday.\n\n\" There's many challenges in the state and I can promise you, no one's doing a lap of honour. I just want to get on with the job. \"\n\nWith two years until the next election, the premier still has time on his side, but the patience voters have shown the government so far could run out much sooner.",

    "text": "The emergence of DeepSeek was the latest catalyst for investors who are increasingly viewing Hong Kong and China\u2019s beaten-down markets as a potential source of opportunity amid Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policies. \u201cThe US has historically been very reliable on making good on its commitments and obviously in the new world it is becoming more challenging,\u201d says Brice. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where we will end up, but I think that some assumptions ... are now so obviously in doubt. People are going to have to think about how they set domestic policy to be more resilient to changes in US policymaking.\u201d Trump has wasted no time in imposing additional 20 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods, but has also irked allies with his 25 per cent levies on steel and aluminium imports and threats of reciprocal tariffs from April 2. \u201cAll of the talk about tariffs is just leading to greater uncertainty,\u201d says Robert Secker, a portfolio specialist covering Asian and Chinese stock markets at T. Rowe Price.\n\n\u201cChina is benefiting to a degree from simply a spike in uncertainty causing investors to look outside the US market for the first time in a long time. It is the same case as in Europe.\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping has raced to grasp the opportunity offered by the increased uncertainty. China\u2019s benchmark sharemarket has surged this year. Credit: Bloomberg Last month Alibaba founder Jack Ma, one of China\u2019s most famous and wealthy entrepreneurs, appeared at a meeting alongside Xi, nearly five years after his criticisms of Beijing\u2019s financial sector saw him abruptly vanish from public life. Ma, who has a fortune worth nearly $US40 billion according to Bloomberg, shook hands with Xi during the meeting with business leaders, where he was seated in the front row.\n\n\u201cYou could see they\u2019re sending soft signals,\u201d says Brice. \u201cJack Ma being on the front row, those sorts of things are important signals to them saying \u2018we support this development\u2019. \u201cFrom a sentiment perspective, I think that was a very strong signal.\u201d China\u2019s leadership began making those signals as far back as September last year, when its mainland stock market and Hong Kong were the \u201cmost loathed\u201d equity indexes in the world. Beijing announced a massive stimulus package while Xi called for the introduction of \u201cforceful\u201d interest-rate cuts, as China\u2019s 24-man politburo \u2013 the highest political body of the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 made a rare admission that its economy was facing fresh turmoil. \u201cThe government came out with some clear statements that they were going to be supportive of the economy, supportive of private businesses, supportive of the property sector and just trying to kickstart the consumption story,\u201d says T. Rowe\u2019s Secker.\n\n\u201cIf you like, there was a policy put in place whereby future bad economic news would be met by positive reaction by the Chinese authorities, so that kind of took away the \u2018China is uninvestable\u2019 threat that had overhung the market ... really from 2021 onwards.\u201d Loading What has followed is a flood of investment in China\u2019s stock markets which has, at least initially, greatly benefited the country\u2019s tech industry. The wider Hang Seng Tech Index has climbed more than 25 per cent in 2025, boosted by companies like internet and gaming giant Tencent, which said on Wednesday that profits in the fourth quarter of 2024 surged 90 per cent as it accelerated a push into artificial intelligence. Ma\u2019s fortune is estimated to have grown by more than $US5.5 billion so far this year as Alibaba, his e-commerce giant, has surged by more than 50 per cent.\n\n\u201cAlibaba has done phenomenally well this year,\u201d says Secker. \u201cThey are in a front-and-centre position to benefit from AI. The stock was incredibly cheap, very underowned, so we had a situation where we\u2019ve seen fast money move back into China. \u201cThis is really a reflection that the market was ignored by international investors over the past couple of years, so they\u2019re beginning to get a little bit more skin in the game.\u201d The surge in China\u2019s markets has piqued interest from the West, which is being courted by China as US tariff policies upend the global world order on trade. Dozens of foreign chief executives were due in Beijing on Sunday and Monday for a flagship development conference where some were expected to meet Xi.\n\nOla Kallenius, chairman of Mercedes, and Laurent Freixe, chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, confirmed their attendance to the London Telegraph. They were expected to join bosses from FedEx, Siemens, BMW, chip designer Qualcomm, Saudi Aramco, Citadel, Rio Tinto, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Standard Chartered and KPMG, according to Reuters. Also among the confirmed attendees was AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot, who on Friday announced plans for the pharmaceuticals giant to invest $US2.5 billion into a new research and development facility in the Chinese capital. Yet the move, which Soriot said \u201creflects our belief in the world-class life sciences ecosystem in Beijing\u201d, came as five of the drugmaker\u2019s current and former staff remain detained by China police over allegations of data privacy breaches. Jack Ma has been welcomed in from the cold by Beijing, and his fortune is soaring. Credit: AP Indeed, most Western investors are still offering \u201ca bit of a raised eyebrow\u201d at the performance of Hong Kong, according to Brice, who retains \u201csome fundamental concerns about how sustainable the broad market rally is\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s economy could still be hit by deflation, he says, with state figures showing this month that inflation fell by more than expected and below zero in February, which was the first time that had happened in 13 months. \u201cAll of the talk about tariffs is just leading to greater uncertainty.\u201d Robert Secker, a portfolio specialist covering Asian and Chinese stock markets at T Rowe Price. The world\u2019s second-largest economy continues to battle with the aftermath of the property crisis that led to the collapse of development giant Evergrande. Meanwhile, markets are yet to see if Trump will follow through on his pre-election threat to put 60 per cent tariffs on China. Last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned he could block outbound investment from the United States. \u201cAt the moment if you want to invest in Chinese stocks, you can. If you\u2019re a US investor, will that change at some point?\u201d said Brice.\n\n\u201cI think there is a non-zero probability there. I think that is suppressing some of the demand that would have been there otherwise.\u201d Many investors remain committed to China, despite the solid gains which prompted a bit of profit-taking from Hong Kong stock market investors towards the end of last week. Loading Fidelity China Special Situations, a London-listed investment trust focused on Asia, has surged more than 25 per cent so far this year. \u201cMajor uncertainties had been weighing on sentiment, including weak consumer confidence, a struggling property market, and concerns over potential US tariff increases under the new administration,\u201d says the fund\u2019s portfolio manager Dale Nicholls.",

But really one of the centrepieces of this budget is Labor's efforts to strengthen Medicare. The budget is about strengthening Medicare and the election is Australia's opportunity to protect it and safeguard it against Peter Dutton. \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Treasurer Angus Taylor has also held a news conference ahead of the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Labor is failing to address the economic pain felt by Australians, and has accused the government of wasteful spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition has promised to fast-track gas approvals and address energy prices if elected - and vowed to cut 36,000 jobs from the public service.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Taylor says the government has let the public service get too big, at a cost to households and businesses. Opposition Treasurer Angus Taylor has also held a news conference ahead of the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This government has made a tax grab on the private sector on this country - households and businesses - of around $400 billion dollars, and he's squandered that. And that's why we've opposed more than $100 billion dollars worth of spending since Labor came to power. And we've said, the public service has got too big. \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian and U-S officials have wrapped up talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at progressing a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meeting was expected to focus on, among other issues, an agreement to stop maritime fire in the Black Sea to allow the free flow of shipping.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt follows talks with a Ukrainian delegation on Monday and is part of a wider push by U-S President Donald Trump to end the three-year-old war.\n\n\n\n\n\nA White House source has told Reuters that progress had been made in the talks, and spoke of a \"positive announcement\" to come in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier today, President Trump held a cabinet meeting, where he said he expects to sign a revenue-sharing agreement on critical minerals with Ukraine soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, probably they have been influenced to get this thing settled because Ukraine wants to see it settled. I think they have to have it settled and Russia wants to see it settled. Europe is giving the money to Ukraine as a loan. We were just pouring money into Ukraine. It was a very unfair situation. So we made a deal on rare earths. But most importantly, we want to stop the killing that's going on, with 2,500 on average, mostly soldiers a week are being killed and they're Russian and they're Ukrainian. And if we can stop it, that's a very important thing to me on a human basis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the meeting was under way, a Russian missile strike damaged a school and a hospital in Ukraine, wounding at least 88 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe director of the Oscar-winning documentary 'No Other Land' has been beaten by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and detained by the Israeli military.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lawyer for filmmaker Hamdan Ballal says he was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeah Tsemmel said she had not been able to speak to the trio, but was told by police they were being held at a military base for medical treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-director Basel Adra said he saw two dozen settlers \u2014 some masked, some carrying guns and some in Israeli uniform \u2014 attack the village.\n\n\n\n\n\n'No Other Land' depicts the struggles faced by Palestinian residents in the West Bank to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military today said it was looking into the incident, but made no further comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in sport...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Manly Sea Eagles halfback Daly Cherry-Evans says he will not accept a last-ditch offer from Manly to stay at the club.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eagles' most-capped player has confirmed he was leaning towards playing on next season, but says it would not be at the Sea Eagles.\n\n\n\n\n\nManly bosses have revealed they plan to offer Cherry-Evans a new two-year deal to ensure he finishes at Brookvale.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the 36-year-old told Channel Nine last night he had talked about the decision with his family and would not take up the offer.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers will announce tonight where billions in federal spending will be allocated.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robert Brooks from Monash University's Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics said while many Australians may benefit from the federal budget announcements, they shouldn't expect any radical changes to their finances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is important to pay attention to announcements, people are particularly interested in the economy and health, but the government is being fairly conservative,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a strong narrative for want of a better term, of responsible economic management.\"\n\n\n\nHow will the federal budget impact you?\n\nLabor is projected to allocate about $730 billion in the budget which comes from taxation and government revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooks explained the budget reflects the economy's performance, with combating inflation being a key priority for government spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government is looking to keep inflation down to a desirable level, so its economic policy will be consistent with measures that reduce inflation and less government spending,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said rebates, tax announcements, and health policies are the key areas to watch, as they will directly affect the everyday cost of living.\n\n\n\n\"The energy bill relief of $150 for households and businesses is not a lot of money, but it is helpful in a sense,\" Brooks said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We won't see any drastic changes to tax settings, that would be a major, major surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Given some budget measures have already been announced, there shouldn't be any surprises for the stock market either.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does the budget say about the economy?\n\nBrooks said the government has previously benefitted from higher-than-expected revenue from Australian exports and commodities, leading to a brief period of budget surpluses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time, however, Labor will announce a budget in deficit, meaning the government is spending more than it earns.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that isn't necessarily a bad thing for Australian households, Brooks said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's fine for budgets to cycle between surplus and deficit so long as there is strong economic policy in place, so people don't need to worry,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some years spending will be higher or lower, it's a normal process the government will go through.\"\n\n\n\nWhat are Labor's priorities?\n\nBrooks said Labor wants to appear economically responsible in its handling of the budget, and is focusing on housing, cost of living and health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It gives an indication of what Labor is focusing on this election and how much they are willing to spend,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne key aspect to look out for is the forward estimates, which show how much the government plans to allocate to various areas in the coming years.\n\n\n\nWhich groups could Labor target in tonight's budget?\n\nThis year's budget is different, as the country heads to the polls by 17 May, keeping the election \"front of mind\" for Labor, Brooks said.\n\n\n\nGen Z and millennial voters now outnumber baby boomers in every state and territory for the first time, which he said is \"really important\" for tonight's budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Younger voters are really asking questions about housing affordability, energy policy, and sustainability, so I'd expect the budget to emphasise those areas.\n\n\n\n",

It's a budget to build Australia's future,\" he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday ahead of handing down his fourth budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the budget would be \"responsible\" with the cost of living crisis \"absolutely front and centre\" of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It strikes the right balance between helping people with the cost of living, and investing in a more competitive, more productive and dynamic economy into the future so that we're more resilient to these global shocks,\" he said.\n\n\n\nChalmers said the budget, and the Australian economy, was in \"much better condition than we found them three years ago\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got the Liberal debt down by $177 billion, and that is saving Australians something like $60 billion in debt interest,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is expected to hit a record level of debt when the federal budget is revealed tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers earlier spruiked the government's \"responsible economic management\" for limiting gross debt to $940 billion in 2024-25.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile that's a record for the Commonwealth and up from the $906.9 billion figure in 2023-24, it's $177 billion lower than it was projected to be in a fiscal update before the last election in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's federal debt is still fairly low compared to the rest of the world, at just over a third of the size of the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, government debt is almost as large as the gross domestic product (GDP), while the United States has surpassed 120 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Australia's debt is expected to grow as public spending increases and a temporary boost to revenue fades, peaking at 37 per cent of GDP.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The government is urging consumers to 'Buy Australian', but it faces the challenge of overcoming a cost of living crisis, product stereotypes, and a \"falling\" sense of national pride.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers confirmed the federal budget would include measures aimed at encouraging shoppers to buy \"wonderful Australian products\" in the aftermath of United States President Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There will be some funding in the budget to support a Buy Australian campaign,\" he told reporters on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nA price tag for the campaign is yet to be announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut swaying consumer habits could be harder than the government is hoping for according to a behavioural economist.\n\n\n\nProfessor Robert Hoffman, a behavioural economist at the University of Tasmania, told SBS News that Australian shoppers don't always make rational decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The perfectly rational consumer would look at every product on its own merits, compare this product to that, and the country of origin shouldn't matter as long as the product's quality, price and characteristics fit what the consumer wants,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, in practice, people aren't rational. In a normal supermarket of 30,000 or more products, they're overwhelmed with information.\"\n\n\n\nCost of goods, stereotypes and bias\n\nThere are several factors that influence buying decisions, with price being especially important as Australians grapple with high mortgage stress and cost of living woes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, consumers may opt for the cheapest product available, regardless of its country of origin.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE From shopping to superannuation: How a US trade war could impact Australians\n\nAnother factor is what Hoffman refers to as 'quality stereotypes'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you think about guitars, you think guitars should be American. And when we hear that actually China makes some very good guitars, we might not believe it so easily and we just follow this stereotype,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Let's buy an American guitar, a German car, French wine, Italian fashion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could pose a challenge for Australian brands and products trying to compete against the decades of trust built by overseas competitors, Hoffman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also flagged an economic concept called \u2014 consumer ethnocentrism \u2014 the tendency of customers preference to domestic products over foreign-made ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A consumer ethnocentrist might say, 'I prefer domestic products because I want to support my country, and I think my country is better and greater and more important than other countries, and I'm willing to pay a little bit more for my own country', so they would already buy domestic products,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis also applies to immigrants in Australia, who may have a preference for products from their home country.\n\n\n\n'Nationalism and patriotism are falling'\n\nHoffman said a decline in nationalism and patriotism could be another barrier to encouraging shoppers to buy Australian products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nationalism and patriotism are falling. For instance, we did another study on military recruitment that's getting harder and harder when nationalism falls. So I suspect the same thing would translate to buying Australian,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFormer army chief Peter Leahy also addressed the decline in patriotism and military recruitment in a statement made in February, emphasising the need for a deeper cultural shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As well as improving the mechanics of recruiting, the more important task is to restore a sense of pride and belonging in Australia and a desire to serve the nation,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is perhaps the most important job for the government, and it needs to get to work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA 'Buy Australian' campaign might prompt shoppers to think briefly about prioritising Australian goods, but Hoffman believes it would not significantly change their buying habits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're less nationalistic and price-motivated, then generally, I think this campaign would not be as successful now as might have been maybe 20, 30, 40 years ago,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we'd be wrong to say people would be thinking about this very deeply.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Is the election promise of cheaper medicines under threat from US tariffs?\n\nWhat does it mean to be 'Australian Made'?\n\nThe Australian Made logos are commonplace in stores and feature a golden kangaroo in a green triangle.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts with the logo aren't necessarily Australian-owned but must have gone through its \"last substantial transformation\" in Australia, according to the Australian Made website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A product has been substantially transformed in Australia if it was grown or produced in Australia, or as a result of one or more processes carried out in Australia, the end product is fundamentally different in identity, nature or essential character from all of its imported ingredients or components,\" the website states.\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas The Australian Education Union welcomed the announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The signing of these agreements is a tremendous win for students, teachers and the broader public education system,\" national president Correna Haythorpe said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal opposition also welcomed news of the deal but wants the prime minister to release all school funding and reform agreements it has reached with the states and territories.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Monday, every jurisdiction except Queensland had accepted a deal to fully fund public schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government had struck deals with Western Australia and Tasmania in 2024 to boost its contribution to 22.5 per cent, leaving the states to increase their funding to 77.5 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard.\n\n\n\nIt also reached updated funding agreements with the ACT and the Northern Territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther states successfully held out for a bigger slice of the pie, with NSW, Victoria and South Australia coming to a deal earlier in 2025 after the Commonwealth offered to lift its share to 25 per cent - foreshadowing the Queensland deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was an opportunity too good to miss,\" Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was an opportunity to bring two levels of government together, but ultimately it's about kids.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A political battleground over the issue of working from home has emerged ahead of the May federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debate kicked off earlier this month when Opposition finance spokesperson Jane Hume said a Coalition government would force all Commonwealth public servants to return to the office five days per week .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Work from home arrangements for public servants should only be in place when the arrangements work for the employee's department, their team, and the individual,\" Hume said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition later watered the proposal down to \"pre-COVID levels\" \u2014 but not after Labor jumped on the comments, arguing paring back work from home would disadvantage working women.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday this type of flexibility had allowed Australians to overcome \"the tyranny of distance\", adding that it was a cost of living issue and could also increase traffic and congestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've met people who have moved into regional Australia and are working in our capital cities, they're working effectively because they can work online,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling shows the Coalition's proposal hasn't been met well by voters and has cost it support in crucial mortgage-belt seats, according to a YouGov poll provided to AAP.\n\n\n\n\"Policies such as getting rid of work-from-home and opposing right to disconnect laws impact working families, and they have noticed this, and they don't like these policies,\" YouGov's director of public data Paul Smith said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA senior Labor Party source has told SBS News the party was confident the Coalition's policy was unpopular with voters, and it is an issue the government will campaign on during the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor is confident the issue has alienated some working women and is seen as failing to understand the modern workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent days, there's been data released separately by Labor and the unions to hammer home their point.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How to make work more flexible in 2025\n\nLabor estimates transport and parking would cost workers about $5,000 a year if they had to return to the office five days a week, up from three.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost is based on estimates people would spend an extra two hours a week in the car, or just under 100 extra hours a year, with commuters driving an average of just over an hour in the car to get to and from work.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) issued a statement on Monday estimating any federal paring back of work from home arrangements would impact one in three workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peak union body said its analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data found more than 600,000 workers nationally currently work from home and a further 320,000 employees do so due to childcare or other caring responsibilities.\n\n\n\nThe Coalition though says it is not proposing a blanket ban on working from home, insisting the focus was only on public servants and their productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No one is banning work-from-home arrangements, that is a Labor lie,\" Hume said on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's shameful the way the Labor Party has tried to twist this policy into something it isn't.\"\n\n\n\nBut the ACTU isn't giving up the fight, saying any clampdown would have a \"flow-on effect\" from public to private sector workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(Opposition leader Peter) Dutton would have to tear up the right to flexible work in the Fair Work Act to get the Australian Public Service back to the office,\" ACTU president Michele O'Neil told SBS News in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That would ruin it for everyone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 36 per cent of employed people worked from home regularly in August 2024, according to the ABS, down from a peak of 40 per cent in August 2021.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The emergence of DeepSeek was the latest catalyst for investors who are increasingly viewing Hong Kong and China\u2019s beaten-down markets as a potential source of opportunity amid Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policies. \u201cThe US has historically been very reliable on making good on its commitments and obviously in the new world it is becoming more challenging,\u201d says Brice. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where we will end up, but I think that some assumptions ... are now so obviously in doubt. People are going to have to think about how they set domestic policy to be more resilient to changes in US policymaking.\u201d Trump has wasted no time in imposing additional 20 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods, but has also irked allies with his 25 per cent levies on steel and aluminium imports and threats of reciprocal tariffs from April 2. \u201cAll of the talk about tariffs is just leading to greater uncertainty,\u201d says Robert Secker, a portfolio specialist covering Asian and Chinese stock markets at T. Rowe Price.\n\n\u201cChina is benefiting to a degree from simply a spike in uncertainty causing investors to look outside the US market for the first time in a long time. It is the same case as in Europe.\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping has raced to grasp the opportunity offered by the increased uncertainty. China\u2019s benchmark sharemarket has surged this year. Credit: Bloomberg Last month Alibaba founder Jack Ma, one of China\u2019s most famous and wealthy entrepreneurs, appeared at a meeting alongside Xi, nearly five years after his criticisms of Beijing\u2019s financial sector saw him abruptly vanish from public life. Ma, who has a fortune worth nearly $US40 billion according to Bloomberg, shook hands with Xi during the meeting with business leaders, where he was seated in the front row.\n\n\u201cYou could see they\u2019re sending soft signals,\u201d says Brice. \u201cJack Ma being on the front row, those sorts of things are important signals to them saying \u2018we support this development\u2019. \u201cFrom a sentiment perspective, I think that was a very strong signal.\u201d China\u2019s leadership began making those signals as far back as September last year, when its mainland stock market and Hong Kong were the \u201cmost loathed\u201d equity indexes in the world. Beijing announced a massive stimulus package while Xi called for the introduction of \u201cforceful\u201d interest-rate cuts, as China\u2019s 24-man politburo \u2013 the highest political body of the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 made a rare admission that its economy was facing fresh turmoil. \u201cThe government came out with some clear statements that they were going to be supportive of the economy, supportive of private businesses, supportive of the property sector and just trying to kickstart the consumption story,\u201d says T. Rowe\u2019s Secker.\n\n\u201cIf you like, there was a policy put in place whereby future bad economic news would be met by positive reaction by the Chinese authorities, so that kind of took away the \u2018China is uninvestable\u2019 threat that had overhung the market ... really from 2021 onwards.\u201d Loading What has followed is a flood of investment in China\u2019s stock markets which has, at least initially, greatly benefited the country\u2019s tech industry. The wider Hang Seng Tech Index has climbed more than 25 per cent in 2025, boosted by companies like internet and gaming giant Tencent, which said on Wednesday that profits in the fourth quarter of 2024 surged 90 per cent as it accelerated a push into artificial intelligence. Ma\u2019s fortune is estimated to have grown by more than $US5.5 billion so far this year as Alibaba, his e-commerce giant, has surged by more than 50 per cent.\n\n\u201cAlibaba has done phenomenally well this year,\u201d says Secker. \u201cThey are in a front-and-centre position to benefit from AI. The stock was incredibly cheap, very underowned, so we had a situation where we\u2019ve seen fast money move back into China. \u201cThis is really a reflection that the market was ignored by international investors over the past couple of years, so they\u2019re beginning to get a little bit more skin in the game.\u201d The surge in China\u2019s markets has piqued interest from the West, which is being courted by China as US tariff policies upend the global world order on trade. Dozens of foreign chief executives were due in Beijing on Sunday and Monday for a flagship development conference where some were expected to meet Xi.\n\nOla Kallenius, chairman of Mercedes, and Laurent Freixe, chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, confirmed their attendance to the London Telegraph. They were expected to join bosses from FedEx, Siemens, BMW, chip designer Qualcomm, Saudi Aramco, Citadel, Rio Tinto, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Standard Chartered and KPMG, according to Reuters. Also among the confirmed attendees was AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot, who on Friday announced plans for the pharmaceuticals giant to invest $US2.5 billion into a new research and development facility in the Chinese capital. Yet the move, which Soriot said \u201creflects our belief in the world-class life sciences ecosystem in Beijing\u201d, came as five of the drugmaker\u2019s current and former staff remain detained by China police over allegations of data privacy breaches. Jack Ma has been welcomed in from the cold by Beijing, and his fortune is soaring. Credit: AP Indeed, most Western investors are still offering \u201ca bit of a raised eyebrow\u201d at the performance of Hong Kong, according to Brice, who retains \u201csome fundamental concerns about how sustainable the broad market rally is\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s economy could still be hit by deflation, he says, with state figures showing this month that inflation fell by more than expected and below zero in February, which was the first time that had happened in 13 months. \u201cAll of the talk about tariffs is just leading to greater uncertainty.\u201d Robert Secker, a portfolio specialist covering Asian and Chinese stock markets at T Rowe Price. The world\u2019s second-largest economy continues to battle with the aftermath of the property crisis that led to the collapse of development giant Evergrande. Meanwhile, markets are yet to see if Trump will follow through on his pre-election threat to put 60 per cent tariffs on China. Last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned he could block outbound investment from the United States. \u201cAt the moment if you want to invest in Chinese stocks, you can. If you\u2019re a US investor, will that change at some point?\u201d said Brice.\n\n\u201cI think there is a non-zero probability there. I think that is suppressing some of the demand that would have been there otherwise.\u201d Many investors remain committed to China, despite the solid gains which prompted a bit of profit-taking from Hong Kong stock market investors towards the end of last week. Loading Fidelity China Special Situations, a London-listed investment trust focused on Asia, has surged more than 25 per cent so far this year. \u201cMajor uncertainties had been weighing on sentiment, including weak consumer confidence, a struggling property market, and concerns over potential US tariff increases under the new administration,\u201d says the fund\u2019s portfolio manager Dale Nicholls.",

    "text": "Losing a cherished pet in an unfamiliar place is a nightmare no owner ever wants to face \u2014 let alone being forced to return home without them, weighed down by heartbreak and guilt.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened to NSW couple Georgia and Josh when their beloved dachshund, Valerie, slipped from her pen and vanished into the wild while they were fishing at Stokes Bay on South Australia's Kangaroo Island in 2023. What followed was a frantic, tear-filled search that stretched over days, but despite their desperate efforts, little Valerie was gone without a trace.\n\nNow, some 500 days after the miniature sausage dog vanished, hope is again on the horizon. In an extraordinary twist, it's emerged that there have been several reliable sightings of little Valerie \u2014 who weighs less than four kilograms \u2014in the last few months, merely kilometres from Stokes Bay.\n\nValerie was last seen in November 2023. Source: Kangala Wildlife Rescue/Facebook\n\nIncredible quest to return long-lost sausage dog to owners\n\nStarting roughly a year after her disappearance in November, 2023, regular sightings of Valerie have been coming into local wildlife groups on Kangaroo Island, with residents reporting to have witnessed a little dog with a pink colour in shrubs around the bay. According to the Kangala Wildlife Rescue group, \"based on firsthand accounts and video evidence\", they now believe \"Valerie is alive\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"She runs at the first sign of humans or vehicles and despite the best efforts of dedicated Island locals, Valerie has been impossible to catch,\" it wrote online.\n\n\"The dedicated volunteers from Kangala, in consultation with Valerie\u2019s family have set out on a mission to find and catch Valerie so she can be reunited with her loving parents who stand ready to provide the care she will need to come home again.\n\n\"We are using surveillance and various trapping and luring methods in the area she was last seen to try and bring her home. This is a tiny dog in a huge area, and we will need help from the public to report any sightings and a lot of luck.\"\n\nGeorgie described her heartache at having to return home to Broken Hill following the tragic loss a year and four months ago. \"I remember on the first day I was just covered in tears. We barely ate anything,\" she told The Adelaide Advertiser. \"My whole world just crumbled. When we left the island without her, I cried for days.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKangala Wildlife Rescue's Jared Karran believes the little dog has been surviving on road kill and dam water. He explained that the luring techniques had been tailored to suit her small size, but mentioned crews are seeking advice from interstate counterparts on the next best steps.\n\nJust this week, more photographic evidence that Valerie is alive surfaced. Georgie, who now lives in Albury, said she was flooded with \"mixed emotions\", while conscious not to get her hopes up. She said she \"never really ruled out\" the possibility her beloved companion was in fact alive.\n\nAnybody with information on Valerie's whereabouts has been urged to contact Kangala Wildlife Rescue on 0493 257 250 or email at kangalawildliferescue@gmail.com.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

Source: Supplied\n\nAn Aussie woman living overseas is desperately trying to make the 13,00-kilometre journey back home after a spate of seizures led to a devastating diagnosis.\n\nShanique Hallgren, 30, moved to Canada three years ago with her fianc\u00e9 James and has been thriving as a visual effects artist in the film industry. However, their incredible adventure took an unexpected turn after she was diagnosed with stage 3 high-grade glioma, a \"rare and aggressive\" brain cancer, following a seizure she had in their apartment.\n\n\"It's changed her life incredibly from being a 30-year-old with her life ahead of her to now coming to grips with having brain cancer that we don't know how that will eventuate for her in her life,\" Shanique's mum Tracey Monahan told Yahoo News.\n\nSeizures mean medical flight is only option to get to Australia\n\nThe couple already had plans to move back to Australia this year but Shanique's cancer diagnosis has solidified their decision to move closer to home \u2014 with the mounting medical bills within the Canadian health system making it even more difficult to imagine a future where they remain overseas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, getting back to Australia is proving difficult as the tumour is positioned in Shanique's frontal lobe, an area of the brain that controls primary motor function, and she is now having difficulty with the right side of her body and is unable to walk unassisted. The seizures are also causing major concern, as the couple did attempt to board a commercial flight but Shanique suffered another within 24 hours of departure, making a medical flight the only option.\n\n\"So the neurologists and the oncologists have said that they do not want her to travel on a normal flight, because the pressurisation in the cabin will affect the swelling in her brain,\" Tracey said. \"She would be stabilised on a medical flight, however, a private medical evacuation flight from Canada to Australia is around about $280,000.\"\n\nThe family have set up a GoFundMe page in a desperate bid to raise funds for the journey.\n\n\"She's on immense amounts of drugs to cope with the cancer and the effects of the seizures,\" Tracey said.\n\nShanique is desperately trying to get home to family in Australia after her diagnosis in Canada. Source: Supplied\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBrain cancers are rare in Australia, with Cancer Australia estimating there to be just over seven cases per 100,000 people. It is unknown what causes gliomas, and while grade 1 gliomas are easily curable with surgeries, grade 2 to 4 provide a more challenging prognosis.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
