    "text": "A court will not force Google to sell off its Chrome browser or Android, a US federal judge has said in a court filing.\n\nThe decision overnight serves as a significant win for the tech company, which has avoided the most extreme possible outcome from a landmark antitrust case that determined the company was operating an illegal online search monopoly.\n\nAlthough Google will not be forced to sell of its Chrome browser or Android, it will have to make certain search data available to qualified competitors to promote competition.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump says he was unaware of theories that he was dead\n\nA court will not force Google to sell off its Chrome browser or Android. (CNN)\n\nIt will also be barred from entering into or maintaining exclusive contracts related to the distribution of services like Chrome, Search, the Google Assistant and its Gemini app.\n\nThose agreements provide a significant source of revenue for Google and broad access to its services, although the company had proposed ditching those contracts as a potential remedy in the case.\n\nUS District Court Judge Amit Mehta said in a ruling that he had accepted Google's proposed remedies, in part.\n\nThe trial put Google's core business under a microscope at a time when it is already under threat of being toppled by AI chatbots.\n\nAnd it comes as the company is also gearing up to defend the operation of its online advertising business after it, too, was found to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year.\n\n\"Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment,\" the filing read.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.\n\nThe ruling was closely watched across Silicon Valley, as other major tech giants are also fighting antitrust cases brought by the US government.\n\nMehta wrote that the rise of generative AI tools have \"changed the course of this case,\" adding that ensuring Google's dominance in search doesn't \"carry over into the GenAI space\" was a key part of the remedies proceedings.\n\n\"And, unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Not exactly a judge's forte.\"\n\nMehta ruled last fall that Google had violated US antitrust law with its search business, writing that the company \"is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nIn the weekslong \"remedies\" portion of the trial, Google argued that the Justice Department's proposed solutions would harm consumers by making it harder to access their preferred search engine and could stunt the US economy and American tech leadership.\n\nThe trial put Google's core business under a microscope. (Getty)\n\nChrome leader Parisa Tabriz testified that forcing Google to sell off Chrome would result in a \"shadow of the current\" web browser and would likely make it \"insecure and obsolete.\"\n\nGoogle has for years inked exclusive, multibillion-dollar contracts with device makers like Apple to secure its position as the default search provider on smartphones and web browsers, encouraging its dominance giving it what the court sees as being an unfair advantage that relies on consumer habit rather than choice.\n\nBy 2020, 95 per cent of all US search queries on mobile devices went through Google, Mehta noted in his opinion.\n\nThe move to prevent Google from entering into exclusive distribution deals is the court's way of levelling the playing field.\n\nGoogle will be barred from entering into agreements that require companies to preload Google Search, Chrome, the Google Assistant or Gemini in order to license its popular Google Play app store.\n\nBut many phone makers will likely still include Google's services because of their popularity, said Carolina Milanesi, president and principal analyst at tech research firm Creative Strategies.\n\n\"The value that these companies bring to the vendors and the people that partner with them is such that I don't know how many will decide not to preload their services,\" she said.\n\nGoogle will still be allowed to pay partners to distribute its services \u2013 including its Search engine \u2013 on their products.\n\nApple and Google have a lucrative deal in which the search giant pays the iPhone maker billions to be the default search engine on its web browser. Ending that partnership would have meant Google would no longer get default distribution on one of the world's most popular smartphones, while yanking a lucrative source of revenue from Apple.\n\n\"Cutting off payments from Google almost certainly will impose substantial\u2014in some cases, crippling\u2014downstream harms to distribution partners, related markets, and consumers, which counsels against a broad payment ban,\" the filing read.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives sees the ruling as a win for both Apple and Google, particularly following a Bloomberg report that the two companies may partner to incorporate Gemini into Siri.\n\n\"While in theory Google is barred from 'exclusive deals' for search this now lays the groundwork for Apple to continue its deal and ultimately likely double down on more AI-related partnership with Google Gemini down the road,\" he said in a research note.\n\nThe outcome is a win for Google overall, says Robert Siegel, lecturer in management at the Stanford School of Business.\n\nBut the decision to prohibit Google from entering into exclusive contracts means the company may have to try a little harder to entice consumers moving forward, especially amid heightened competition from rivals like OpenAI and Perplexity \u2013 the latter of which made an unsolicited, far-fetched offer to buy Chrome last month.",

(Louise Kennerley)\n\nData also revealed a quarter of students who began university in 2017 had dropped by the end of 2022, the second-highest dropout rate on record.\n\nThese revelations come as leading universities around the country are slashing budgets, staff numbers and course offerings.\n\nLast month , the University of Technology Sydney suspended enrolments for over 100 courses amid rumours of 400 teaching jobs being made redundant.\n\nMeanwhile, TAFE enrolments are on the rise, thanks to incentives such as fee-free courses.\n\nThis has seen TAFE numbers in NSW recover and rise to around 404,000 at the end of 2024.\n\nOne Aussie who left university for TAFE is Sydney, who commenced a Bachelor of Engineering at UTS in 2016.\n\nShe never finished her degree, instead completing a Certificate IV in Engineering Drafting in 2022.\n\nSydney told 9news.com.au the fee-free incentives were a big motivator, and said the style of teaching differed between TAFE and her experience at university.\n\nSydney is one of many people who turned their back on university in favour of TAFE. (TAFE NSW/Supplied)\n\n\"Teachers [at TAFE] definitely care about you more, feedback is more personalised,\" she said.\n\n\"Some lecturers and tutors [at university] are very helpful and others kind of don't care.\n\n\"It feels like teaching is teaching, and caring about students is secondary.\"\n\nTAFE NSW is actively recruiting women to enter their courses as it looks to fill skills shortages, and indicated future programs were in the pipeline.\n\n\"We deliver a range of programs and short courses designed to give high school students a taste of vocational education, encourage more women to consider careers in trades, and support people to upskill or reskill,\" a TAFE NSW spokesperson told 9news.com.au.\n\nSydney's course took one year and included work placement, which helped her get a full-time job at an engineering firm in Parramatta in Sydney's west.\n\n\"I got industry experience at the same time as studying TAFE,\" she said.\n\n\"TAFE gave me a more hands-on experience in terms of learning programs and things like that, whereas at uni, the onus is on you to learn the program.\"",

    "text": "As a select group of world leaders prepares to roll into Beijing for a massive military parade on Wednesday, one has travelled in his signature armoured green train: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un .\n\nThe old-fashioned train has become a symbol of Kim's dynasty and his secluded nation. It has also long been the subject of intrigue, carrying generations of the Kim family across the country and on rare international trips.\n\nNorth Korean state media confirmed on Tuesday night that Kim's train had arrived in Beijing. When he crossed into China earlier in the day, photos showed the leader smiling on board the train, sitting at a wooden table with a North Korean flag behind him.\n\nNorth Korea leader Kim Jong Un waves from a train in Pyongyang, North Korea. (KCNA)\n\nHe's accompanied by senior officials including Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, according to the country's foreign ministry.\n\nKim's father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, was reportedly averse to flying and relied heavily on the train, according to Reuters.\n\nIn one instance in 2002, Russian state media showed images of the train \u2013 green with yellow striping \u2013 when Kim Jong Il visited Russia during a brief period of relaxed sanctions that allowed greater engagement with the outside world.\n\nBoth Kim's father and grandfather reportedly hosted lavish dinners aboard. One account published in 2002 by Russian official Konstantin Pulikovsky claimed that the train carried cases of Bordeaux and Beaujolais wine from Paris, and that passengers feasted on live lobster and pork barbecue.\n\nBut that brief period of openness and luxury ended quickly, with international sanctions clamping back down in 2003. Though very little information from the isolated nation reaches the outside world now, reports indicate severe impoverishment and malnourishment throughout much of the country.\n\nThe train is famously slow-moving and tight on security. It's so heavily armoured that it travels at an average speed of 60km/h, according to a 2009 report in South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo.\n\nA special train carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. (Kyodo/CNN)\n\nIt contained conference rooms, an audience chamber and bedrooms and featured satellite phone connections and flat screen televisions, the paper reported at the time. In Kim Jong Il's time, some 20 stations were built for the family train, the paper said.\n\nKim has used this train on several trips abroad, though he has also previously travelled by plane and private jet.\n\nKim rode the train during his last international visit \u2013 a 2023 trip to Russia's far east to meet with his counterpart Vladimir Putin. Photos released by state media at the time offered a glimpse into the locomotive, showing polished wooden floors and an ornately decorated white doorway.\n\nState media footage released in 2022 showed Kim working in his office on board the train, and also relaxing on board while smoking a cigarette in a short-sleeved shirt, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.\n\nAnd during a 2018 trip when Kim met Chinese leader Xi Jinping, footage by North Korean state media showed Chinese officials boarding the train to greet Kim. The delegations held talks on board, sitting on two rows of pink couches, photos showed.\n\nBesides international travel, the train has also been featured in state propaganda, with the Kim family going on long train journeys to meet ordinary North Koreans, Reuters reported.\n\nA life-sized model of one of the train's carriages is displayed in a mausoleum outside the North Korean capital Pyongyang, where the remains of Kim's father and grandfather are kept.",

    "text": "The indestructible Derryn Hinch is sitting near his walking frame, recovering from a \"bad fall\", contemplating life in a nursing home and the possibility of being a candidate for voluntary assisted dying.\n\nHe admits he has only \"a few years left\" and there's time for reflection, but no regrets.\n\nExamples: he doesn't like being called the \"human headline\", doesn't think he has often been wrong, admits to being inconsistent, agrees he was an alcoholic but still drinks, says one of his toughest times was being falsely accused of rape, and claims that he is in no way arrogant, something which may surprise some.\n\nHinch is 81 now, and after four wives, 17 sackings, three stints as a prisoner, several dances with death and treating his liver like a punching bag for decades he's still competitively driven, preparing in advance for criticisms he suspected would be raised in this discussion.\n\nI spoke to him for my podcast Neil Mitchell Asks Why? at his city flat, which is small but has some of the most magnificent views in Melbourne.\n\nIt is here, surrounded by personal memorabilia, that he reads, sleeps, does puzzles and \"cloud watches\".\n\nIt's an age away from the opening nights, long lunches, Rolls-Royces and pay cheques which today would still be staggering.\n\nDerryn Hinch has lived many lives: a broadcaster, a senator, several marriages and a litany of health issues. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nOf course, even with age, some things never change.\n\nThe man whose every hiccough has been public property for more than 40 years is happy to share his battles with the pain of ageing.\n\n\"Originally, I thought I didn't ever want to go into a nursing home,\" Hinch told me.\n\n\"But I'm told now by some of the nursing homes I've been talking to that you can still socialise there and it's not like you are locked away.\"\n\nAnd death?\n\nHe's had liver cancer, a liver transplant, facial melanoma that required significant radiation treatment, a life-threatening blood infection, and recently cardiac arrhythmia, where the heart doesn't beat properly and is effectively stopped and restarted to get back into rhythm.\n\n\"I'm very lucky that my brain still seems to be going,\" he said.\n\n\"Some people will dispute that, but it seems to be.\n\n\"But if my brain went, I've told my medical attorney not to revive me.\"\n\nAnd would he consider voluntary assisted dying?\n\n\"Yes, I would. Yes. One of my best friends, Bob Rogers, did have his life taken by voluntary assisted dying because he had no quality of life.\n\n\"He couldn't go to the toilet by himself. He couldn't shower. He couldn't dress himself.\n\n\"And the last time I took him out to lunch I had to get on my hands and knees to lift his feet into a taxi.\n\n\"I thought, 'This is not living.'\"\n\nRogers, who was 97, died in May last year.\n\nHe was a broadcasting icon for over 78 years.\n\nHinch, who was described as a spokesman for the Rogers family after the death, once offered to fly with Rogers to a Zurich euthanasia clinic and \"be with him while he went\".\n\nBut the family did not agree.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Huge snowfalls push ski season into spring\n\nLate radio icon Bob Rogers. (Nine Entertainment)\n\nHinch himself has been close to death at least twice.\n\nHis liver transplant was 14 years ago and was, he says, a \"punt\".\n\nThe donor liver came from a drug addict and may have carried dangerous infections.\n\nIt later emerged that without the surgery, Hinch would have been dead in two weeks.\n\nBut he remains a committed atheist, not having a \"bob each way\" as the inevitable approaches.\n\n\"When you're dead, you're dead. I don't believe in heaven and I get uncomfortable when people say, 'Oh, he will meet so and so upstairs.'\n\n\"I find that pretty embarrassing.\n\n\"I stopped taking communion when I was about 12 and told my parents I didn't believe it anymore. I have no belief at all.\"\n\nExcept, perhaps, self-belief.\n\nHis mind remains sharp and the strong self-belief hasn't faded.\n\nHe has no self-doubt.\n\nBooze has been a constant in the Hinch life.\n\nLunches were marathons and he once wrote a newspaper column claiming to drink four bottles of white wine every day.\n\nThat's eight times the recommended daily intake, and exactly why he ended with cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nHe reluctantly agrees he \"thinks\" he was an alcoholic and says he stopped drinking for eight years out of respect for the donor of his liver.\n\nHe now drinks occasionally, he says.\n\nSo why the broken promise?\n\n\"It's partly because I've only got a few years left. I want to live well. But partly because my donor was a drug addict.\n\n\"I think I've made a deal with him.\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Friend of accused gunman says he could have network of supporters helping him\n\nDerryn Hinch has been imprisoned three times. (Nine)\n\nI've had many disagreements with Hinch over the years.\n\nHe showed few regrets as we argued the cases again, particularly how he reported the deaths of cricket legend David Hookes and television icon Graham Kennedy.\n\nOn the day of Hookes' funeral, Hinch broadcast that the cricketer had a girlfriend many didn't know about.\n\nHe claimed on-air Graham Kennedy \"died with AIDS\", which he now admits was \"a mistake \" and says he has apologised.\n\nAdmitting he was wrong does not come easily.\n\nHinch's catchphrase was always \"all history owes the dead is the truth\" while I argued publishing anything required a balance between benefit and hurt.\n\nWe still don't agree.\n\nHe was deeply upset by losing his Senate seat after only three years, but immensely proud of driving legislation to stop international travel by sex offenders.\n\nAs a commentator and a senator he has seen many politicians first hand: he gets on well with Anthony Albanese, thinks John Howard was a good leader, is very fond of Malcom Turnbull, thinks Bob Hawke was not a nice man, and Jeff Kennett is an enigma.\n\nHinch has been seriously broke, with less than $20 available at the ATM.\n\nHe has been very rich, and once owned two Rolls-Royces, one for himself and one for then wife Jacki Weaver.\n\nThey were different colours, he says.\n\nThere's no doubt he's been a trouble magnet, a larger than life tabloid journalist at times ahead of his time and at times infuriating with his uncompromising views.\n\nIn that sense, age hasn't changed him.\n\nIn Derryn's world, there are rarely shades of grey.\n\nLack of confidence has never been his problem, although he does say the nickname \"human headline\" seems \"narcissistic\".\n\nThis is how our discussion ended:\n\nMITCHELL: You have no self-doubt. You stand by things you've done. You don't really see many mistakes in your life. Do you think you're arrogant?\n\nHINCH: That's for you to decide.\n\nMITCHELL: That's a political answer. You're back in the bloody Senate. What do you think?\n\nHINCH: I don't think it's arrogant. I think it's just confidence.\n\nMITCHELL: What's the difference?\n\nHINCH: Donald Trump is arrogant. I'm self-confident.",

    "text": "An independent working group looking into Libraries ACT has delivered a scathing report detailing issues within its workforce.\n\nThe report found that staff were regularly working overtime to ensure libraries stayed open and were being stretched in an effort to maintain services.\n\nIt found, among other issues, that issues around leave and \"a culture of micromanagement\" had led to staff burnout and poor morale.\n\nAmong the impacts on the public was the number of days libraries have had to shut their doors, which has more than doubled in the past 12 months.\n\nThe report found significant issues including with staffing, morale and burnout. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nIn delivering the report, its authors made 37 recommendations, including an overhaul of rostering systems.\n\nIt also recommended changes for Civic and Erindale libraries, which have seen a drop in visitation numbers.\n\nStaff morale a key issue\n\nStaff morale was described in the report as an area in significant need of improvement, and one that was affected by inadequate staffing, frequent leave denials and unclear role expectations.\n\n\"Many staff report a reluctance to apply for leave due to fears of rejection, leading to a rise in unplanned absences that disrupt staffing and service continuity,\" the report found.\n\n\"Extended wait times for leave approvals, frequent leave denials, lack of transparency or consistency around leave considerations and a lack of role clarity and accountability have significantly impacted staff morale, contributing to reports of burnout.\"\n\nLibrary staff gave feedback anonymously as part of the review. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nOne staff member said inadequate staffing meant they could not attend public programs such as children's storytime without other areas of operations suffering.\n\n\"When I'm running a program, I can't help customers or shelve \u2014 it's all hands on the program,\" the staff member said.\n\nLibrary closures primary concern\n\nThe working group was unable to pinpoint one particular factor behind the sharp increase in closures across Libraries ACT in the past 12 months.\n\nIn 2023-24, the number of days branches were closed was 42, while in 2024-25 there were 94 days.\n\n\"The recent increase in branch closures is a result of a series of complex and deeply embedded staffing, cultural, operational, and systemic issues,\" the report said.\n\n\"These have significantly affected staff morale, engagement and organisational cohesion and decreased community service delivery.\n\n\" At the core of these challenges lies a persistent breakdown in trust and communication at all levels ... this has created a work environment where many employees feel unsupported, disempowered and undervalued. \"\n\nChanges proposed for Civic and Erindale\n\nThe working group also examined Civic and Erindale libraries, finding their catchment areas overlapped with others and visitation numbers had dropped at both.\n\nCivic Library, which is rented at more than $366,000 per year, is already proposed for a possible relocation as part of the Civic and Cultural District Master Plan.\n\nThe authors suggested exploring other models for these libraries, including something similar to the express library in use at Sydney City Council's town hall.\n\nThe report recommended developing a \"transition plan\" for both libraries within the next three to six months.\n\nIt also suggested adjusting opening hours at underperforming branches across the network.\n\nThe report recommended considering altering opening hours for some library branches. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nAccording to the report, Libraries ACT faces significant financial concerns, with a projected cash deficit of $1.7 million in 2025/26.\n\nMeanwhile, 20 positions within its workforce remain unfunded, which the report said was the main driver of its deficit.\n\nThe report recommended temporarily restoring branch staff numbers to the level they were at in 2022/23, with funding allocated for two years.\n\nIt also recommended an overhaul of the rostering system, which it said had become \"overly complex and inconsistent\".\n\nThe working group said casuals were also an area that needed improving, finding that Libraries ACT was at risk of violating the Fair Work Act by keeping them on in an ongoing capacity.\n\nIt recommended providing casuals \"with opportunities to apply for permanent or part-time roles as they become available, supporting workforce stability\".\n\n'Culture of micromanagement'\n\nClosures of ACT Libraries branches increased significantly in the past 12 months. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nThe working group reported issues around how decisions were made within Libraries ACT, which they said contributed to the inefficiency plaguing the organisation.\n\n\"This structure has led to a culture of micromanagement, where leadership is hesitant to delegate authority and staff are reluctant to take initiative,\" it said.\n\n\"The result is a stalemate that fosters inefficiency, decision fatigue among senior leaders, and frustration among frontline staff who feel disempowered and undervalued,\" the report said.\n\nIt said many employees were \"unsure of their responsibilities or how their roles align with broader organisational goals\" and noted that more junior employees were often asked to train senior, higher-paid staff and new starters.\n\nThe report also detailed issues with transparency around decisions among leadership.\n\n\"Branch staff often feel that decisions are made without their input or consideration, and that communication from leadership lacks empathy and understanding,\" it said.\n\n\"In turn, enabling staff report that they face significant barriers in communication, often learning of critical incidents days or weeks after they occur.\"\n\nAmong the recommendations, the report authors suggested developing \"a transparent, inclusive, and respectful communication culture to bridge the divide between staff and leadership\".\n\nWorkplace culture 'toxic for a number of years': union\n\nCommunity and Public Sector Union (CPSU) ACT regional secretary Maddy Northam said the report showed staff within Libraries ACT were finally being listened to.\n\n\"The workplace culture there has been toxic for a number of years and CPSU members have been screaming out for something to be done,\" Ms Northam said.\n\n\"Thankfully, now there's been this report, and we have some recommendations that can be implemented hopefully very quickly.\"\n\nCPSU Regional Secretary Maddy Northam said providing adequate staffing and addressing staff morale were priorities at Libraries ACT. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nMs Northam said staff had been leaving libraries \"because they couldn't handle the stress anymore\".\n\n\"Now is the time for the government to show things are changing,\" she said.\n\n\"And really importantly, for the communities that rely on these library services every day.\"\n\nChanges already made: minister\n\nACT City Services Minister Tara Cheyne said workers's human rights were being violated. ( ABC News: Ian Cutmore )\n\n\"Anyone who's read the report can feel how harrowing the situation has been for staff,\" City Services Minister Tara Cheyne said.\n\nMs Cheyne said \"distrust\" had developed between staff and leadership, and steps were already being taken to change the situation.\n\n\"[The report] shows that actually there's been numerous reviews and reports over the years that either staff aren't aware of the outcomes of or the recommendations have been cherry-picked and not all implemented,\" she said.\n\n\"And so my commitment to staff, which I shared with them when I personally shared the report with them, was to say my commitment to you is this is a process that will be led by you.\n\n\" Too much has happened to you without you and without you understanding why. \"\n\nThe minister said some \"different perspectives\" had been brought in from other parts of the government around leave and rostering to enact changes.\n\nOne such change, Ms Cheyne said, was that branch managers were now working together each morning to discuss how to handle any unplanned absences, \"rather than it being elevated to more senior levels that aren't necessarily in that operational environment\".\n\nMs Cheyne said the government was also looking at opening hours to see whether they could be changed, including at branches that are open at night when few people visit.\n\nMs Cheyne said the issues around leave were a human rights concern and a working group had already been established to improve the system.\n\n\"That's one of the most uncomfortable parts of the report for me because it's a breach of human rights, it's a breach of workers' rights,\" she said.\n\n\"That process had been really opaque to staff about how decisions were made.\n\n\"Obviously, the community has been incredibly let down when we've had to close libraries as a result of these unplanned absences.\"\n\n'An absolute disgrace'\n\nVarious reviews have been carried out into Libraries ACT over the years, most of them since 2019, and the report found little had come of them.\n\n\"In nearly all instances, there was no evidence of the implementation of these recommendations or any structured delivery programs that assigned responsibilities or established timelines for deliverables,\" the report said.\n\nCanberra Liberals leader Leanne Castley described the report as \"damning\" and an \"absolute disgrace\". (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nACT Opposition Leader Leanne Castley was scathing in the wake of the report's release.\n\n\"It's a damning report,\" she said.\n\n\" To know that there's been many reviews over 20 years and another one has talked about poor culture, to the point where the libraries aren't able to stay open, as expected, and the minister has done nothing, is an absolute disgrace. \"\n\nMs Castley called on the ACT government to act swiftly to address the issues.\n\n\"What we see is, it's not just libraries, unfortunately \u2014 it's health, it's corrective services, across the board, you ask government employees whether they feel supported by ACT Labor, I'm pretty sure you will find the same,\" she said.",

    "text": "Drivers in Brisbane may soon be able to turn left at red lights, with the state government considering reviving the road rule.\n\nA previous trial of the rule was axed by the former Labor government in 2021 when it decided the time-saving benefits didn't outweigh safety risks.\n\nThe rule allowed drivers who have come to a stop to turn left at a red traffic light, provided they give way to other traffic, and was only able to be used at signposted intersections.\n\nFigures from the Brisbane City Council (BCC) showed around 15 million turns had been made from the start of the trial in 2013.\n\nAt one point there was as many as 50 intersections where the rule was permitted, before it was steadily rolled back, with just 17 remaining by its end.\n\nTime-saving benefits questioned\n\nIn 2021, former transport minister Mark Bailey said a study found motorists were saving just nine seconds, and causing risks to pedestrians.\n\nNow, Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner has written to the government to advocate for a review of the road rule, and Transport Minister Brent Mickelberg says he is happy to look at it.\n\n\u201cWe are open to this review and are seeking advice from the department on how it could be rolled out and what needs to be considered,\" Mr Mickelberg said.\n\n\" As our population grows, we need to ensure there is a responsible balance between safety, efficiency, and practicality for all road users. \"\n\nLord Mayor Adrian Schrinner has written to the state government to request a review of the rule. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nBrisbane feeling the traffic pressure\n\nSome motoring and road safety experts have raised concerns, with a spokesperson for the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ), saying they were not convinced the road rule would ease traffic woes in the city.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"While left turn on red was originally introduced to improve traffic flow, evaluations in Queensland showed it increased risks for vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists, without being able to be applied in enough locations to meaningfully reduce congestion,\" they said.\n\n\"It also created confusion among drivers about where it was permitted, leading to inconsistent and unsafe behaviour.\n\n\"RACQ believes safer alternatives \u2014 such as dedicated turn lanes, green arrows and slip lanes \u2014 are better long-term solutions for improving efficiency without compromising safety.\"\n\nScramble crossings allow pedestrians to cross diagonally. (ABC News: Dan Smith)\n\nChief executive of the Pedestrian Council of Australia Harold Scruby told ABC Radio Brisbane a better way to improve safety outcomes was through scramble crossings.\n\n\"It's a diagonal crossing. You'll see them all around the world, all through Asia, Europe and even America,\" he said.\n\n\"Pedestrians can cross either directly across the road or diagonally, so they don't have to cross the road twice.\n\n\" That means you re-prioritise pedestrians in the city, not the motorists. \"\n\nBCC acting infrastructure chair Danita Parry labelled the former government's decision to axe the trial as \"heavy-handed and out of touch\".\n\n\"The left turn on red trial was enormously successful, helping people get around our city sooner and safer,\" she said.\n\nMs Parry said the city council would work with the state government on initiatives like the trial to \"help keep Brisbane moving.\"",

Money was going out of his accounts, appearing as if it could be payments to him and his wife, but never appearing in their personal accounts.\n\n\"I had insurances for things like [cancer], and I did get paid some sums of money for that, but all of that money seemed to get drained away from my accounts over the next 12 to 18 months in varying capacities,\" Mr Alford said.\n\n\" We spoke to the banks about it and we never quite got to the bottom of it. \"\n\nCredit cut-off\n\nThen his bank, Bankwest (now owned by Commonwealth Bank), seemed to want to stop doing business with him. It was happy for him to hold an account for personal funds only, but indicated it wanted his credit accounts gone.\n\n\"They were starting to want us to get rid of every [loan] facility we had, close any loans for commercial reasons only,\" he said.\n\n\"I can say I never defaulted once in my life on any of my credit, and my wife as well.\n\n\" The bank just didn't seem to want to deal with us anymore. \"\n\nThe unexplained withdrawals continued, and by 2021 the couple had had enough.\n\n\"We decided we'd pack up and move away, move to Darwin and set up a new life.\n\n\"We had money.

    "text": "John Powell wants to shout the entire Melbourne Symphony Orchestra a drink.\n\nIn fact, the English-born film composer feels so sorry for the amount of work the orchestra is about to do, that he says he'll buy them two drinks.\n\n\"The bill for the bar would be huge because I really owe them,\" he tells me from London, ruefully. \"Especially the brass section \u2026 I really feel for them.\"\n\nJohn Powell spoke to me on the eve of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra performing a live music screening of the Academy Award-nominated animation classic, How to Train Your Dragon, featuring Powell's electrifying score, which includes a full orchestra, a choral section, old Celtic instruments and enough hard work by the brass section to keep animated dragons in flight for one and a half hours.\n\nPowell's How To Train Your Dragon score is beloved among fans of the original film series. (via Dreamworks)\n\nBoth the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the MSO have announced that they will perform the second movie in the franchise, How to Train Your Dragon 2, in 2026.\n\nFilm music on stage\n\nLive film performances have now become so popular for Australian orchestras that they sell out upon announcement.\n\nAt the three packed Melbourne events in July, it was especially moving to see every kind of audience member excitedly at a classical music performance: from footballer types with mullets, to families, to music students, to young couples dating. Next year, the MSO will have four performances of the film.\n\nTelling the story of a misfit young Viking, Hiccup, and his accidental friendship with the creature that is supposed to be his enemy \u2014 a sweet and fearsome dragon called Toothless \u2014 HTTYD is the first part of an epic trilogy that's beloved by music and film fans. The music frequently appears on all-time best film music lists.\n\nPowell will return to Oz at the end of the year to score John M Chu's Wicked: For Good. (Supplied: John Wilson)\n\nIn Australia, Powell's score ranked 37 in the ABC Classic 100 Music for the Screen poll in 2022, and you can happily lose days down internet rabbit holes, watching music scholars and amateurs pore over the power and beauty of the composition. It's a cult of adoration that catches even this veteran of more than 70 film compositions by surprise.\n\n\"This score is on the forefront of anything that a lot of students I've ever met have said, especially more recently,\" Powell says.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon was a creative triumph. The remake is fine Photo shows A young man in a green vest puts his hand out to touch the nose of a big black animated dragon with green eyes How to Train Your Dragon is the latest movie to be picked up by the live-action remake trend.\n\n\"It certainly makes me feel old because people who don't seem that young come up to me and say, 'Oh, this meant so much to me in my childhood'. It wasn't that long ago!\"\n\nIt actually was. HTTYD was released by Dreamworks in 2010, with Powell working on the score a year before.\n\nHe'd been shown an early cut of the movie, and once he heard the Scottish accents of the Viking characters, he connected to his own Scottish heritage and the Celtic sounds emerged.\n\n\"As a kid, my grandmother used to ask me to play for her, so I had to play reels and things on the fiddle so that she could sing 'mouth music' \u2014 kind of Gaelic working songs \u2026 I probably let that just come out in a way that I hadn't had a film to be able to do that in. So, it was a flood of various influences, but one that I'd never really tapped into.\"\n\nA life in music\n\nPowell has talked about being taken to a performance of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto at the age of seven, and having his head turned for all time.\n\nAs a child, he played the violin and viola, then studied the former at the Trinity College of Music, central London. After finishing college, he composed music for commercials, which led to a job as an assistant to composer Patrick Doyle on several film productions.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 1997 and scored his first major film, Face/Off, going on to compose for films such as the Bourne and Happy Feet series, Shrek and Wicked, the second part of which he is anxiously trying to tie off when we talk. \"I've still got another 15 minutes to write,\" he says.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nPowell says the secret to film composition is to watch the film he's been asked to score as any ticketholder would.\n\n\"As an audience member, I'm experiencing the story,\" he says.\n\n\"Then things well up, or I feel kind of a kinetic energy in certain places, or I feel where it should slow down and where I need as an audience member to feel, to be allowed to feel things.\n\n\"And obviously the flying [in HTTYD] was really the main inspiration. Test Drive was more complete than a lot of the other sequences when I first saw the film, so I think that was a big part of what inspired mostly everything about what people like in the score.\"\n\nTest Drive, the scene when Hiccup finally manages to fly with his disabled dragon, is hailed by music critics as one of the most exhilarating film compositions of all time, and a brilliant cinematic depiction of what it would feel like to fly.\n\nPowell's first film score was for the 1997 action film Face/Off. (Supplied: Rebecca Morellato)\n\nSoaring inspiration\n\nAs well as the Oscar nod, Powell's score has received several award nominations, including recognition from the International Film Music Critics Association for Film Music Composition of the Year, yet it still astounds Powell to realise how revered the sequence of breathtaking animation and soaring music is.\n\n\"Yeah, I can't quite believe that that's the case,\" he says.\n\nPowell was a member of legendary film composer Hans Zimmer's music studio, Remote Control Productions, (Supplied: Melinda Lerner)\n\nPowell says the art of composition is often more chance than design.\n\nThe enduring musical motif of Test Drive, with its skirling drums and simple tune, wasn't always destined for that scene.\n\n\"I'd like to say I sit down and write themes for very specific scenes, but often I don't have a terribly specific intent. I'll sit at the piano ... and just scratch out some tunes \u2026 and you start playing around with these themes \u2026 and then you realise this is a tune for someone who's an outsider, or somebody who's an outsider who finds their way.\"\n\nPowell says music as diverse as Florence and the Machine or Massive Attack might be the influence or the inspiration for a score, and he sounds as open to new music now as he might have ever been as a younger composer.\n\n\"All the music cues are keys, so you're trying every lock. And some of them not only unlock that one scene, but they unlock a whole set of things about how to do the score,\" he says.\n\n\"You need tunes that latch themselves onto story points \u2026 then you start playing with the tunes, you move them around. I'd like to tell you it's very organised, but it's mainly chaos until it settles down and reveals itself.\"\n\nThe Sydney Symphony Orchestra will perform the world premiere of How to Train Your Dragon 2 in Concert at the Sydney Opera House on June 25-28, 2026.\n\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra will perform HTTYD2 at Hamer Hall from August 27-30, 2026.",

It was insane how dedicated he was to family,\" he said.\n\n\"He was always present, he was not distracted when you were talking to him, he'd always be listening.\n\n\"He didn't drag anyone down with his life admin stuff.

(ABC Kimberley: Dunja Karagic)\n\nMalunggu is today part of a wildlife sanctuary called Mornington, more than 400,000 hectares of bush belonging to several native title groups, family holders and traditional owners including Bunuba and Kija people.\n\nSince 2001 the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC) has held the pastoral lease, working to protect more than 200 species of birds, marsupials and reptiles that inhabit the area.\n\nTogether with the AWC, Ms Middleton has dedicated \"a lot of effort\" and time in developing a collaborative post-flood recovery project, which was jointly funded by the federal and WA governments under the disaster recovery funding arrangements.\n\n\"The focus since the flood is coming back to Malunggu, looking at how the flood affected [the area] since the last time we were here,\" she says.\n\n\"But also reconnecting back through our cultural obligations that we have to follow, that we were taught.\"\n\nFlood damage\n\nIn January 2023 \"once-in-a-century\" catastrophic floods ripped through the Fitzroy Valley, in the aftermath of ex-Tropical Cyclone Ellie.\n\nAWC regional operations manager and conservation ecologist Skye Cameron says it had \"devastating impacts\" on Mornington.\n\n\"It was complete devastation to all our facilities,\" Dr Cameron says.\n\n\"The water was up to the roofs, we lost all our equipment, we lost a herbarium we've been collecting for 20 years, all that historical knowledge from AWC\n\nThe flood devastated infrastructure at Mornington.

    "text": "Federal government agencies are facing a backlash over their dealings with gas giant Santos, which allowed a major methane leak to be kept secret from the public for years.\n\nThe ABC this week revealed a design flaw in a storage tank at the Darwin Liquefied Natural Gas (DLNG) plant led to it leaking thousands of tonnes of climate-polluting methane since its inception in 2006.\n\nDespite this, Santos has been cleared to use the faulty tank until 2050 for its new Barossa gas project without fixing the leak or measuring emissions, in what environmentalists have branded a \"national scandal\".\n\nThis followed advice to Santos over the leak from the federal Clean Energy Regulator and CSIRO, which neither agency has been willing to detail publicly.\n\nThe location of the LNG tank in Port Darwin. ( )\n\nThe Clean Energy Regulator has told the ABC it has no record of any advice to Santos, despite the company reporting the leak to it by email in 2020.\n\nThe CSIRO, which Santos engaged as \"independent and respected experts\" for what to do about the leak, has refused to release records of its advice on the grounds this could harm its \"commercial activities\".\n\nThe ABC's revelations of the leak sparked criticism of the role of federal regulators from crossbench senators in Canberra, including David Pocock and Monique Ryan.\n\nFederal Greens leader Larissa Waters said the party would call for an auditor-general review of \"what is either a spectacular failure of regulators or a deliberate cover up by successive governments to protect a gas corporation's profit margin\".\n\nSenator Waters has also written to federal ministers questioning apparent inaction by the Clean Energy Regulator, as well as CSIRO's \"financial relationship with Santos\".\n\n'No such documents exist'\n\nAn email obtained under Freedom of Information (FOI) shows that the day after Santos took control of the DLNG in May 2020, it asked the Clean Energy Regulator about how to report a spike in estimated emissions from the leak.\n\nSantos told the regulator that its drone surveys on the DLNG tank \"identified methane emissions of 832 tonnes per annum\", which was more than what it had reported using guidelines under the National Greenhouse and Energy (NGER) scheme .\n\n\"We are seeking your confirmation that the drone monitoring results are not able to be used within NGER reporting?\" it said.\n\nHowever, when the ABC applied under FOI for any responses, the Clean Energy Regulator said \"no such documents exist\".\n\nThe Clean Energy Regulator said it had \"undertaken extensive searches of all relevant electronic and hard copy databases and filing systems for the documents you have requested, however has been unable to locate any existing documents that contain the information you are seeking\".\n\n\"Based on these searches, I am satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to locate any documents relevant to your request, but no such documents exist.\"\n\nIn response to questions from the ABC about the advice, the regulator said it \"does not generally comment on advice provided to individual regulated entities about their specific circumstances\".\n\nThe estimated leak was the equivalent of more carbon emissions a year than nearly one in four companies that reported to the Clean Energy Regulator in 2023-24.\n\nCSIRO secrecy over 'commercial activities'\n\nDocuments obtained under FOI show Santos also paid the CSIRO for advice on what to do about the leak.\n\nThe company engaged CSIRO as \"independent and respected experts to provide a recommendation on the best course of action to take from here with regards to remediation and prevention\", an officer from the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Authority said in a November 2020 email.\n\nThis was a \"really good outcome as it is very similar to the recommendation we discussed and proposed\", the officer said.\n\nHowever, the CSIRO refused to release details of its research to the ABC under FOI because to do so could harm its \"commercial activities\".\n\n\"The research commissioned was carried out by CSIRO on a commercial basis, on a full cost-recovery basis, in direct competition with the private sector,\" it said.\n\n\"CSIRO's undertaking of this commercial activity, and with it the experience, knowledge and trust gained, is also reasonably anticipated to generate similar commercial opportunities for CSIRO in the foreseeable future by virtue of increasing CSIRO's attractiveness to industry stakeholders in this field.\n\n\"The release of the research and analysis described in the relevant document would damage CSIRO's ability to secure those future commercial opportunities, while also damaging its existing relationships with industry, causing a clear detriment to CSIRO where it is working in direct competition with the private sector.\"\n\nCall for disclosure\n\nLarissa Waters has called for the disclosure of Santos payments to CSIRO for its advice on the gas leak. ( )\n\nIn a letter to the federal minister responsible for CSIRO, Tim Ayres, Senator Waters said there was \"no evidence that [the agency has] taken any action to limit the leaking of methane or advise relevant departments or agencies with these regulatory responsibilities\".\n\nShe called for the disclosure of CSIRO's advice and all financial agreements with Santos.\n\n\"In light of CSIRO's role as the appointed monitor of the methane leak, on this occasion it gives rise to a perception that the reason for their passivity and secrecy can be attributed to the financial relationship between the CSIRO and Santos,\" she said.\n\nSenator Waters also wrote to Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen asking \"what the [Clean Energy Regulator has] done to inform you on this persistent methane leak [and] how it has been allowed to continue\".\n\nShe asked, \"If these emissions have been included in our national greenhouse accounts, and what can be done by the federal government to require Santos to repair or replace the leaking tank before any shipments from Barossa arrive?\"\n\nThe NT EPA has said the leak at DLNG poses no immediate threat to the community or the environment, and repairing it is a \"commercial decision for Santos\".\n\nIt says the methane emissions are a concern because they will contribute to global warming, but this was a matter for the Clean Energy Regulator.\n\nSantos has said the tank is safe and fit for use until 2050, that DLNG has all relevant regulatory approvals, and it reports emissions in line with national guidelines.",

    "text": "With the exception of names like our grand Dames of opera, Nellie Melba and Joan Sutherland, Australia's track-record of nurturing talent here at home hasn't always been stellar.\n\nConductor Simone Young, arguably one of Australia's most successful exports since Sutherland, ventured overseas to build her career after facing challenges in the Australian landscape. For the last 30 years, Young honed her skills in Europe's major opera houses and orchestras.\n\nIn 2022, Young became Chief Conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, giving Australian audiences a consistent chance to see her in action.\n\nYoung isn't the only Australian hitting goals both here at home and around the globe.\n\nMore Aussies on the world stage\n\nIt's been a great year for Australian musicians on the world stage.\n\nThis month Daniel Carter starts his post as Music Director of the German National Theatre and State Orchestra in Weimar, Germany, a position previously held by J.S Bach, Franz Liszt and Richard Strauss. And Ingrid Martin was appointed Assistant Conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.\n\nSimone Young live with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra Photo shows Australian conductor Simone Young holding her baton above her head. Live from the Sydney Opera House, hear Simone Young conduct the Sydney Symphony in music by Richard Strauss, also featuring pianist Andrea Lam. 8pm, Friday September 5.\n\nThere are hundreds more Aussies doing great things around the world. Enough to form an entire orchestra, the Australian World Orchestra. Their members are drawn from far-flung places including Berlin, Chicago, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, London and more.\n\nLuckily for us, many of these musicians regularly perform in Australia. The Australian World orchestra is coming together this week for performances in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\"It's such an exciting time for Australian classical music with artists like Siobhan Stagg and Simone Young shining on the world stage and bringing that brilliance home,\" says Alice Keath, presenter of ABC Classic's What's On, a guide to Australia's best classical concerts and live performances.\n\nOpera singer Siobhan Stagg is another Australian who chose to hone her craft on European stages for over a decade. She recently made her debut with Opera Australia to much acclaim.\n\nSiobhan Stagg living the dream of being an opera singer\n\nMildura-born soprano Siobhan Stagg built her operatic career in Europe's opera houses, but visits Australia regularly. (Supplied: Jakob Tillmann)\n\nMany people dream of singing in an opera, but few manage to realise it.\n\nBecoming an opera singer requires superb vocal technique and an affinity for acting. It also involves constant hard work, rigorous training and finding someone willing to give you a chance to prove yourself.\n\nStagg made her dream a reality.\n\nOriginally from the regional Victorian town of Mildura, Stagg proves that you don't have to be Taylor Swift or own a private jet to make the world your stage.\n\n\"She's already notched up performances at many of the major [opera] houses in Germany, France, Holland, Chicago and Ireland,\" says ABC Classic Legends presenter Mairi Nicolson. Not to mention major festivals in Edinburgh, Adelaide, Aix en Provence and the BBC Proms.\n\nStagg has made a home and a name in Berlin, where she has been living since 2013. But she regularly visits Australia.\n\nRecently finishing her debut run with Opera Australia as Susanna in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, Stagg is making a brief visit to Berlin before flying back for another extended stay in Australia.\n\nStagg has appeared on numerous international stages and at many major festivals. (Siobhan Stagg: Samantha Meuleman)\n\nWith new operas and symphony concerts written especially for her, Stagg is expanding her repertoire.\n\nEarlier this year she starred in a brand new opera, The Dark Side of the Moon, by Berlin-based composer Unsuk Chin. Stagg played the lover of a 1930s fictional quantum physicist with a slowly fragmenting mind.\n\n\"They share a special connection, but their love story is never quite realised,\" Stagg says.\n\nAfter a concert with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in September and making a debut with State Opera of South Australia as Juliette in October, Stagg will perform a brand-new symphonic concert piece written especially for her.\n\nSimone Young at the height of her power\n\nIf you don't know Young from the concert stage, you might recognise her from Knowing The Score, a documentary charting her meteoric rise to become one of the world's top conductors.\n\nWith more than 40 years of conducting under her belt, Young is at the height of her power. She's regularly on the podium in Europe's leading opera houses and concert stages in New York, New Zealand and Sydney.\n\nEvery year, this small German town stages the most extravagant operas Photo shows Simone Young conducts the Sydney Symphony string section, her left arm extended and her right holds the baton in front of her. Bayreuth Festival is one of the classical music world's most exclusive stages. Before Simone Young, no Australian ever conducted from its podium.\n\nYoung made history last year as the first Australian and first woman to conduct Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle in Bayreuth, a series of four operas totalling 15 hours. It takes hundreds of players and a cast of singers to bring to life.\n\nThe festival was started by Wagner himself in 1876, in a theatre he built to stage his grand vision for the operas. Young has just returned from Bayreuth where she conducted the Ring Cycle for the second year running.\n\nBack in Sydney, Young will perform the music of Richard Strauss, a contemporary of Wagner whose symphony has become an iconic part of screen music, particularly Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\n\nIf that name doesn't ring a bell, the opening strains certainly will. The dominant trumpet call featured in 2001: A Space Odyssey made this household music. It's also been referenced in popular culture from The Simpsons to the recent Barbie movie.\n\n\"Strauss' lush harmonies, intense emotionality, walking the tightrope between despair and ecstasy \u2014 these are all powerful elements in a symphony concert,\" Young says.\n\nAs the recent Hottest 100 of Australian songs showed, music lovers take fierce pride in celebrating the achievements of home-grown talent who can only thrive with our support. It's the same for classical music.\n\nKeath says: \"The best way audiences can support musicians is by showing up.\"\n\n\" Go to their concerts, tune in on ABC Classic and help create a strong, engaged community that celebrates and sustains this incredible talent. \"\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

    "text": "Top seed and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has been handed a walkover into her fifth straight US Open semifinal after opponent Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 withdrew from their quarterfinal due to a knee injury.\n\nJust hours before the pair were set to hit Arthur Ashe Stadium for their last-eight clash, Czechia's Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 pulled up in pain while hitting on an indoor practice court.\n\nThe 2023 Wimbledon champion had been scheduled for a final hit-up on Ashe about two hours before her clash with Sabalenka but tweaked an injury while hitting a forehand in practice.\n\nThe 26-year-old immediately doubled over in pain and walked to her chair, covering her face with a towel as she started to cry before walking off the court.\n\n\"I tried my best to take the court today but during the warm-up I felt again my knee and after consultation with the tournament doctor decided not to risk aggravating the injury,\" Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 said in a statement.\n\n\"I appreciate all the support \u2026 and apologise to the fans who were looking forward to the match. I had an amazing time here in New York and can't wait to be back next year.\"\n\nDemon's shot at an exorcsim Photo shows Alex de Minaur smiles while holding tennis balls at the US Open. Alex de Minaur knows he needs a few things to go his way to push \"all the way\" at the grand slams, and he has finally caught some breaks in New York ahead of a quarterfinal clash with Felix Auger-Aliassime from 1:30am Thursday.\n\nESPN showed footage of Sabalenka in the players' tunnel being told by an official about the withdrawal while on her way out to practice, ultimately turning around and booking another practice session.\n\n\"So sorry for Marketa after all she's been through,\" Sabalenka wrote on social media.\n\n\"She has been playing amazing tennis and I know how badly this must hurt for her.\n\n\"Take care of yourself and I hope you can recover quickly.\"\n\nAryna Sabalenka will face Jess Pegula in the semis for a rematch of last year's final. (Reuters: Mike Segar)\n\nIt has been a rough stretch for Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, who two years ago became the first unseeded woman in the Open era to win Wimbledon, climbing to sixth in the rankings by the end of the season only for injuries to strike.\n\nHer title defence at SW19 ended in the first round last year and she missed the back half of the year, including the Paris Olympics and US Open, with a hand injury.\n\nShe returned in January this year, but retired from a match at the Adelaide International and could not line up at the Australian Open, playing a handful of matches in Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai in February before sitting out three months with a shoulder injury.\n\nShe returned for a second-round exit at the French Open and then won her first tournament since Wimbledon 2023, beating Madison Keys, Ons Jabeur and Sabalenka en route to the Berlin Open crown in June.\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport? Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\nRanked 60th coming into New York this year, she beat seeded players McKartney Kessler (32), Jasmine Paolini (7) and Elena Rybakina (9) in three successive matches to reach her first US quarterfinal since 2023.\n\n\"It breaks my heart that I can't step on court today at the US Open because of the injury I picked up in my last match,\" Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 wrote on social media.\n\n\"This place is so special to me \u2014 exactly one year ago I was in surgery, not even sure if I would ever return. Being back here, competing again and enjoying such beautiful matches has meant more than words can say.\"\n\nSabalenka will face fourth seed Jess Pegula in the semis after the American beat another Wimbledon-winning Czech, 2024 champ Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, 6-3, 6-3 to reach the final four at her home slam for the second straight year.\n\nPegula lost to Sabalenka in last year's final.\n\nAlcaraz remains perfect in charge to semis\n\nCarlos Alcaraz is yet to drop a set at this year's US Open. (Getty Images: Clive Brunskill)\n\nOn the men's side of the draw, 2022 champion Carlos Alcaraz continued his imperious march by reaching the semifinals and staying on course for a potentially high-voltage showdown with 24-time grand slam winner Novak Djokovic.\n\nThe second-seeded Spaniard produced yet another clinical display to beat Czech 20th seed Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 in the quarterfinals, and secured his spot in the last four without dropping a set this year.\n\nAlcaraz, 22, who is chasing his first hardcourt major title since his breakthrough triumph at Flushing Meadows three years ago and sixth overall, will await the winner of the evening session encounter between Djokovic and 2024 runner-up Taylor Fritz.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nIf Djokovic gets to the semifinal, he will arrive with a 5-3 win-loss record against Alcaraz, having beaten him in their last two clashes \u2014 in the Australian Open quarterfinals this year and last year's Paris Olympics final.\n\nAlcaraz can take the world number one ranking from Jannik Sinner if he emerges triumphant in New York at the end of the fortnight, but is trying not to think about that at this stage.\n\n\"If I think about the world number one spot too much, I'm going to put pressure on myself and I don't want to do that,\" Alcaraz said.\n\n\"I just want to step on court, try to do my things, follow my goals, and try to enjoy as much as I can.\"\n\nIn the other half of the draw, Australian Alex de Minaur is up against 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime from 1:30am Thursday AEST in their quarterfinal, vying for a semifinal berth against the winner of the all-Italian showdown between Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "Something to look forward to: The Power should be back in the finals hunt next year, but they will need to get busy in the trade period. Do they have enough true stars? Missing out on Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera will hurt. Late season injuries have given the youngsters a chance. We like what we have seen of Jack Whitlock, who can play ruck and go forward. Best and fairest winner: Zak Butters.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nEssendon (15th)\n\nWins: 6. Losses: 17. Draft picks: 4, 5, 22, 25. What went well: The Bombers have some superb youngsters. In his second year, Nate Caddy again gave glimpses of the player he could become, with 20 goals and more flashes of brilliance. Isaac Kako gave Bombers fans something to get excited about. Credit: AFL Photos Isaac Kako impressed with his smarts around goals and showed late in the season he can also be developed as a pinch-hitter in the centre square.\n\nArchie Roberts, the lowest draft pick of the trio, could end up being a steal. The teenager is advanced beyond his years, demonstrating composure and skill in a defence that was under siege. Angus Clarke is another of the club\u2019s 15 debutants this year who has provided Bombers fans with hope in a wretched campaign. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Ben Hobbs. In his fourth season, Hobbs, 21, failed to take a more significant role in the side. Worryingly for Hobbs, despite Essendon\u2019s litany of injuries, he was dropped for the first leg of the final round and could not break back into the team. Hobbs has stagnated in his past two seasons, reaching 20 disposals in just three of his past 30 games. His disposal remains a worry. If time has run out for the first-round pick from the 2021 draft, it would raise further queries on the Bombers\u2019 recruiting and player development.\n\nSomething to look forward to: The draft. The Bombers have a strong hand in this year\u2019s draft after acquiring Melbourne\u2019s first selection through a pick swap last year. Even accounting for father/son, academy and NGA picks, the Bombers should have access to two very good youngsters. If Sam Draper departs through free agency, that should deliver another first-round pick. Unfortunately for the Dons, this is not considered the strongest draft, but one experienced recruiter has said they would not be surprised if smokies emerge deeper in the pool. Best and fairest: Zach Merrett.\n\n-Andrew Wu West Coast (18th)\n\nWins: 1. Losses: 22. Draft picks: 1, 14, 19, 32, 50. What went well: Sorry West Coast fans, this is not pretty. The Eagles have managed 11 wins in four seasons, including just one victory, over St Kilda, in a torturous 2025 season. But there\u2019s always a glimmer of hope and performances and players to celebrate. Two-time Richmond premiership player Jack Graham, who joined the Eagles for 2025, comfortably exceeded his career average for disposals (19.2 possessions per game this season) and had 7.8 tackles per game (which is considered \u201celite\u201d).\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: The defensive unit and the defence coaches. West Coast comfortably conceded the highest number of points (2438) this season, leaving them with a limp percentage of 60.1. If premierships are built from the backline, they need to focus there. It will be fascinating to see the club\u2019s attitude towards Tim Kelly, who played 19 games in his sixth season with the Eagles. Something to look forward to: It couldn\u2019t get any worse, could it? If West Coast haven\u2019t bottomed out, where is the bottom? The Eagles can expect the No.2 draft pick as compensation for losing free agent Oscar Allen to Brisbane, so that\u2019s something. And Harley Reid is staying for now, having resisted interest from big Victorian clubs to extend until the end of 2028. Eagles fans can only look forward to better times ahead.\n\nBest and fairest tip: Jack Graham.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits North Melbourne (16th) Wins: 5 Losses: 17 Draws: 1 Draft picks: 20, 21, 39, 57 What went well: They made it out of the bottom two! The Kangaroos and coach Alastair Clarkson would have liked to see more progress on the ladder, but he remains bullish they are heading in the right direction.\n\nNorth Melbourne avoided another bottom-two finish. Credit: Getty Images After a torrid first six rounds and the odd thrashing beyond that, North were generally more competitive, including securing a draw with Brisbane, but there were no statement wins. Instead, they would be pleased with Harry Sheezel\u2019s transition to a midfield-forward role, the continued development of Colby McKercher and career-best seasons from Cam Zurhaar and Paul Curtis. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Will Phillips. The No.3 pick in the COVID-19-impacted 2020 draft class played only seven matches this season and does not appear to be in the Roos\u2019 plans. He should latch on somewhere, but needs to get going to save his career.\n\nSomething to look forward to: Next year promises to be the season when North Melbourne finally take a genuine leap. How high that is remains to be seen, but the expectations must rise, even if that is as modest as aiming for between eight and 10 wins. The young talent is there, and they may have finally found Nick Larkey\u2019s sidekick in Cooper Trembath. A stiffer defence and another progression from their midfield group should enable them to take another belated step. Best and fairest: Luke Davies-Uniacke.\n\n- Marc McGowan\n\nRichmond (17th) Wins: 5. Losses: 18. Draft picks: 2,3 What went well: Plenty for a club that was widely tipped to sail through turbulent waters with a drastically young and inexperienced list. The season began on the best note possible with a stunning round-one win over Carlton. The nature of the victory, a come-from-behind triumph, set the tone for the season for both the Tigers and Blues. Throw in highlights from Maurice Rioli jnr, and all was swell. Tim Taranto had a strong season as one of the Tigers\u2019 on-field leaders. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: The club\u2019s forwards and the forward coaches. The Tigers scored the fewest number of points (1449), less even than West Coast, a club that limped to one victory, compared to Richmond\u2019s five. Veteran spearhead Tom Lynch could cop a drive-by sledge for missing games. He played only 16 matches (due largely to a suspension) after a tough couple of years with injuries. Something to look forward to: There\u2019s so much to look forward to. Realistically, the Tigers will battle to replicate their win-loss tally (5-18) as they continue to develop their young group.\n\nIt could be a case of the \u201csecond-year blues\u201d for a host of players. But Richmond will be eyeing off their matches against Carlton and the chance to knock them off again. Best and fairest tip: Tim Taranto.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits St Kilda (12th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 7, 43, 58. What went well: The Saints were a popular choice to sink into the bottom four, but finished three wins clear of that territory while prioritising youth.\n\nThe Saints will welcome Tom De Koning in 2026 and welcome back Max King after another injury-riddled season. Credit: AFL Photos St Kilda\u2019s round two upset of Geelong was a false dawn, but a peek at their upside. They also demolished Fremantle and executed the greatest three-quarter-time comeback from 46 points down against Melbourne. That latter win was the first of four in a row before they almost upset GWS in round 24. Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s emergence as a top-liner was massive, while Max Hall followed Cooper Sharman and Max Heath as a mid-season draft success story.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Zak Jones. The brother of ex-Demons captain Nathan was not one of the five Saints who re-signed last week, and faces an uncertain future. Jones turns 31 in March, and St Kilda already made it clear they want to get younger in the midfield. Something to look forward to: Another two years from Wanganeen-Milera, who they retained despite Adelaide and Port Adelaide wanting him. There is optimism about what Mattaes Phillipou, Darcy Wilson, Alix Tauru and Tobie Travaglia can become, while the likes of Hugo Garcia, Isaac Keeler, Hugh Boxshall and Lance Collard also show promise. Tom De Koning will be on the list in 2026, and Max King will hopefully be fit again. Best and fairest tip: Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan\n\nSydney (10th) Wins: 12. Losses: 11. Draft picks: 9, 27, 45, 63. What went well: Having won just four of their first 12 games under new coach Dean Cox, the Swans showed fortitude to rebound and win eight of their final 11 games. Brodie Grundy returned to his best form for Sydney in 2025. Credit: AFL Photos Playmaker Isaac Heeney had a tough start, but then reminded everyone why he is a legitimate star.\n\nChad Warner was a consistent threat through the midfield, but did not have the impact he enjoyed through 2022-24. A serious ankle injury through the pre-season sidelined Errol Gulden for months and seriously hurt the Swans\u2019 midfield and creative drive, just as his return in round 15 had the reverse effect. Brodie Grundy reinforced why he is one of the competition\u2019s premier ruckmen. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Skipper Callum Mills. For the Swans to make the leap next season, Mills needs to consistently be on the park. His 2024 campaign was derailed after injuring his rotator cuff in a Mad Monday celebration. He missed the first half of this year because of plantar fascia. He needs to lead the way in 2026. Something to look forward to: This has been a year of recalibration for the Swans, and learning, particularly for Cox, who is now more at ease in the top role after replacing John Longmire.\n\nWhile it feels somewhat of a wasted year, the Swans are still in top-four mode, and are likely to be strengthened through the trade period. They just need to get moving earlier next season. Best and fairest tip: Isaac Heeney.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Carlton (11th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 34, 44, 62*.\n\nWhat went well: Not much. George Hewett was one of few Blues to exceed expectations, putting together a career-best season in the midfield. Jack Silvagni and Tom De Koning are both leaving the Blues. Credit: Getty Images Better known as a defensive onballer, Hewett became a prolific ball-winner in his own right. In his 12th season on an AFL list, the former Swan is a strong chance to win his first best and fairest award. Veteran Nick Haynes overcame a horror start at the club to become dependable defender. He deserves another year. Young midfielder Cooper Lord is one to watch. George Hewett stepped up for the Blues in 2025, but didn\u2019t get enough support. Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Blues blooded seven debutants, the best of whom looks to be key defender Harry O\u2019Farrell, who, unfortunately, injured his knee. Other gains were bitter-sweet. Jack Silvagni was a revelation in defence but played just 13 games and is now on the move. Ollie Hollands found plenty of the ball in his new role as a running defender but his kicking needs work. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Mitch McGovern. The Blues are keen to get money off their books and the writing is on the wall for the 30-year-old, who narrowly missed a games trigger that would have earned a contract extension. With Silvagni walking out and O\u2019Farrell to be unsighted for much of 2026, the defender may yet get another year, but it will be on the Blues\u2019 terms. Veterans Adam Saad and Blake Acres both had ordinary seasons.\n\nSomething to look forward to: With mass change underway in the coaches box, free agents Tom De Koning and Silvagni confirming their departures, and ongoing chatter about Charlie Curnow, it\u2019s already been a turbulent off-season for the Blues, and the AFL home and away season isn\u2019t even officially over yet! Expect that turmoil to continue for some time yet. But once they ride that out, there will be hope again. The departures of De Koning and Silvagni will strengthen the Blues\u2019 draft hand to acquire highly-rated Harry Dean as a father-son pick. Decimated by injury in 2025, the Blues can vault back into finals contention with a cleaner bill of health. Curnow (assuming he stays) and Sam Walsh had interrupted preseasons which severely impacted their year. Harry McKay missed half the season. Matthew Cottrell and Elijah Hollands, two of their best runners, hardly played, and heart-and-soul defender Nic Newman didn\u2019t get on the field at all.\n\nThen there\u2019s the prospect of a fit Jagga Smith. Get all them right and the Blues should be stronger \u2013 but this was a year when they fell well below expectations. Best and fairest tip: George Hewett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu Melbourne (14th) Wins: 7. Losses: 16. Draft picks: 23, 51, 59*\n\nWhat went well: Kysaiah Pickett graduated from a star goalsneak to a game-breaking midfielder/forward who now rivals skipper Max Gawn as the club\u2019s best player. Despite their troubles, the Demons secured Pickett\u2019s prized signature in a huge coup, keeping him in the red and the blue until the end of 2034 on a lucrative contract. Midfielders Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver are stars for Melbourne and both have long-term contracts, but that no longer means their respective futures at the club are guaranteed. Credit: Getty Images Gawn was again a colossus, talking through action on the field and becoming their spokesperson for almost every crisis off it. Rebounding defender Jake Bowey has taken the next step to become a driver of the team while Harvey Langford, the No.6 pick in last year\u2019s draft, is the Demons\u2019 next A-grade midfielder after making a seamless transition to senior football.\n\nVeteran forward Jake Melksham, with 33 goals from 18 games, earned himself another contract, which was confirmed by the Demons just days after their season ended. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Clayton Oliver and Christian Petracca. Do two of Melbourne\u2019s greatest players want to stay? If either player wants out, the club should not stand in their way. Coming back from a life-threatening injury, Petracca\u2019s season was steady, and he will likely finish in the top six of the club\u2019s best and fairest award, but a long way from his game-breaking ways.\n\nLoading Oliver was better than last year when his campaign was compromised by his off-field issues. Both still have time to return to their best but the competition trend away from contest and stoppage towards speed and ball use is against them. Jacob van Rooyen went backwards in a season the club needed him to hold down a key forward posting. Something to look forward to: The appointment of a new coach always renews hope among the supporter base. Nathan Buckley is the early favourite but whoever succeeds Simon Goodwin must decide whether the core of this list can rise again after two years of diminishing returns or if it\u2019s time to invest more heavily in the next generation.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size He was born into a storied Australian family famed for its entrepreneurialism \u2013 and for fierce intrafamilial fighting. A legal feud over the multimillion-dollar estate of a member of the Hordern retailing dynasty is playing out in the Supreme Court in Sydney, decades after the last of the family\u2019s shops were shuttered in NSW. The case is one of a rising number of disputes over inheritances, and it highlights some of the common threads in wills and estates litigation.

Credit: Fairfax Media Samuel Carr Hordern, a former stockbroker and City of Sydney alderman \u2013 a councillor, in the modern parlance \u2013 died in 2023, aged 94. Under a will dated June 2017, he left the bulk of his estate, worth at least $10 million, to his second wife. He left his four children, including two stepchildren, $250,000 each. His daughter Dinah launched proceedings last year against her stepmother in a bid to secure a greater share of the estate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDinah informed me that she seeks an order for provision from the estate for approximately $7 million,\u201d Justice Francois Kunc said in a preliminary decision in May. Those proceedings are at an early stage, and orders made by the court last month suggest Dinah may re-work her claim and launch fresh proceedings to challenge the validity of the will. Meanwhile, Hordern\u2019s son Matthew has launched a separate case. Latest in Hordern family disputes The cases are the latest in a series of Hordern disputes. Historically, separate family businesses competed against each other in Sydney. Samuel Carr Hordern\u2019s great-great-grandparents, English migrants Anthony and Ann Hordern, arrived in Sydney in the 1820s. Ann\u2019s drapery business in Pitt and later King Street was the beginning of the retail empire. The former Anthony Hordern and Sons building on the site of what is now World Square.

Credit: Alan Gilbert Purcell/Fairfax Media Their son Anthony II laid the groundwork for what became the sprawling Sydney department store Anthony Hordern & Sons, occupying the site of what is now World Square.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades this was a separate business to Hordern Brothers in Pitt Street, around what is now the MidCity shopping centre. Hordern Brothers was run by Samuel Carr Hordern\u2019s side of the family. Cutting the inheritance pie Dinah Hordern\u2019s claim started as an application for a family provision order. This is a way for those closest to a deceased, including current or former dependants, to seek a larger slice of the inheritance pie if inadequate provision was made for them in a will. The number of family provision cases filed in the NSW Supreme Court has increased over the past 20 years, from 655 in 2005 to 996 last year. But the claims are not a modern phenomenon. \u201c[It] had its origins in the Roman Empire,\u201d said HWL Ebsworth partner Guy Moloney, an expert in wills and estates litigation. \u201cThey had laws like this in Rome, and then they were revived, first in New Zealand ... in the late 19th century, and then Victoria, and soon every state and territory in Australia [followed].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoloney said the policy objective was to ensure that if a deceased estate had resources to support a person in need who had a moral claim to a share of it, provision was made for them to \u201cease the burden\u201d on state resources. It was \u201csocial legislation\u201d focused on need, not fairness, he said. \u201cThe fact that it can override a person\u2019s will is what creates consternation,\u201d Moloney said. But he believed the laws generally achieved their objective. Speaking hypothetically, Moloney said an estranged child who had been troublesome to a parent and had been cut out of their will might, \u201cperversely, be the person who is in the greatest need\u201d when their parent died. He said part of his job was to advise clients drafting a will that \u201cif you give this problem child nothing, that might incite a claim\u201d for a family provision order. \u201cThe wise advice \u2026 might be to leave them something, if they can, [as] a deterrent amount,\u201d Moloney said. Turnbull Hill Lawyers partner Adrian Corbould, a specialist in wills and estates law, said family provision claims were \u201cnot a free-for-all\u201d. The categories of people who are eligible to seek a family provision order are relatively confined, such as a current or former spouse, de facto partners and children. The court must be satisfied adequate provision hasn\u2019t been made for them on a needs basis. Grandchildren or others who lived with the deceased may be eligible if they can demonstrate they were \u201cwholly or partly dependent\u201d on them at some point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA person who is neither a spouse nor partner but is living with the deceased in a close personal relationship, sharing a household and providing care, is also eligible. But eligibility is just the first hurdle before an order can be made. Corbould said the categories of eligible people reflected the \u201cinnate public feeling that you should, where circumstances warrant and permit, provide for your spouse and children [and other dependants] on your death\u201d. Lovers of a married deceased may emerge to seek a share. In a current case, a former football boss who lived what a NSW judge described as a \u201ccolourful but \u2018hard living\u2019 life\u201d made a will shortly before his death leaving his entire million-dollar estate to his wife of 28 years. His lover in Greece wants the court to make an order giving her a slice of the estate. The experts made clear the cases were about need. A financially secure person would have difficulty persuading a court they needed a family provision order. \u201cYou have to prove \u2018why do I need it\u2019, not \u2018why do I want it\u2019,\u201d Corbould said. \u201cThey\u2019re the kinds of claims that settle for low tens of thousands, just to make them go away.\u201d Corbould noted the vast majority of wills were not contested, meaning a person was free to divide their assets as they wished and there was a \u201cvery, very good chance\u201d it would not be challenged.

    "text": "That\u2019s a tough gig for anyone, let alone a 29-year-old professional footballer who is paid to perform on the field. Particularly when as, AFLPA president, he is also obliged to be conscious of a player\u2019s well-being and entitlement to a fair process when they overstep the mark as Rankine did. The stage is set for another showdown between the Crows and Magpies. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than one issue. It\u2019s bigger than the two players [who] are involved in that incident. It really is a league-wide topic so it is one I have addressed with my AFLPA president hat on,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI feel a profound sense of responsibility to be in this position, to navigate these conversations and to stand up for what is right and what\u2019s wrong. As an industry, we have an enormous place in Australian cultural life and so part of that is about the impact that we have on the community.\u201d\n\nThe week after the Rankine incident, Moore made a short public statement on the Players\u2019 Association\u2019s social media channels applauding former West Coast player Mitch Brown for his \u201ccourage and candour\u201d in coming out at as bisexual. Again, Moore struck the right tone. \u201cStories like his have so much to teach us an industry if we are willing to learn,\u201d he said. On Thursday night he takes the AFLPA hat off and puts on a headband to assume another huge responsibility. Moore will lead a shaky Collingwood back to the scene of Rankine\u2019s outburst as they attempt to overcome a hostile crowd, a quality set of Crows\u2019 forwards, Taylor Walker\u2019s 300th game, and an average, at best, form line to reach the preliminary final. The three-point defeat to the Crows in round 23 was one of five losses Collingwood endured in their final seven matches of the home-and-away season. They clung to fourth spot when they beat Melbourne by a goal and Port Adelaide upset the Suns in Power\u2019s final match for the season.\n\nRather than letting the wonky form deplete their confidence, Moore says the lessons learned in the previous two months has given his team renewed optimism about their chances in September. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really galvanised as a leadership group. We\u2019re an experienced team so we know the answers, and we know that we\u2019re capable,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if. It\u2019s a question of how for us.\u201d Moore was Collingwood\u2019s best finals player in 2022 Credit: AAPIMAGE That question is more challenging to answer without Jeremy Howe and Bobby Hill. Tougher than the 14-peaks challenge they met after 16 matches when they won their 14th match of the season against Carlton in round 17, and reset their goals. Since then, Moore\u2019s form has been questioned. So has Collingwood\u2019s ability to score. And whether the Magpies\u2019 ageing list will last the distance.\n\nLoading Moore hits back at any criticism with a verbal spoil that spikes the question about their defence over the fence and three rows back. \u201cWe\u2019re the number one team for scores against in the league. That is really the ultimate test of the defence. For me as a leader and a key part of our defence, that\u2019s a massive one,\u201d Moore said. Of course numbers can tell all sorts of stories with the Magpies conceding 70.73 points per game over 23 rounds, 77.42 points per game in the final seven matches and 67.50 points per game in the final two rounds. The question about Moore\u2019s own form is met with the sort of defensive qualities likely to be on display when he joins his teammates in tackling the triple towers of Taylor Walker, Riley Thilthorpe and Darcy Fogarty.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re defending as a team and it has a system, so it\u2019s not on one person. That\u2019s certainly been the key for me in my game is to find that balance between when to impact and when to play system defence,\u201d Moore said. Back we go: The Magpies will head to Adelaide for week one of the finals. Credit: Getty Images So the Magpies are capable defensively. Their biggest issue is converting inside 50s into goals, something they have worked on in the past month, having only broken 80 points twice in their past seven matches. Moore is switched on to what lies ahead. He is part of a club that has travelled to Adelaide as underdogs for three finals and won each time. He knows he has experienced players all around him who have proved their capacity to perform when it matters. And if the wary intensity he provides to conversation translates on the field, the Crows are in for a fight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got incredible experience [and] we\u2019ve got great trust in what we\u2019ve been able to do as a core group that have played together for a long time,\u201d Moore said.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size What keeps you awake at 4am? For Tschabalala Self, there\u2019s a list of things. \u201cHow do I live? What will happen to me when death comes? Do I have a spirit \u2013 and what does that mean? What is the purpose of my life? Am I loved? Am I allowed to feel fear? Am I able to love others? Is my life worth anything?\u201d These are the things all of us worry about, says the acclaimed US artist. \u201cThat\u2019s my primary interest, investigating those universal sentiments and making artworks that resonate on that frequency, so people can recognise that this is our shared humanity; basically the existential concerns of being a human being.\u201d These conceptual, invisible elements, she argues, sit side by side with external ideas about self \u2013 our skin, for example. Being black, American, and a woman are all parts of the 34-year-old artist\u2019s identity, and they also inform her work. Tschabalala Self in her studio. That duality of the seen and unseen selves is explored in the Harlem-born artist\u2019s upcoming show, Skin Tight, which opens at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art this month. Curated by ACCA\u2019s Dr Shelley McSpedden and CEO and artistic director Myles Russell-Cook, the show features 30 artworks, and is designed as an immersive experience. While this is Self\u2019s first Australian show, she is a big name internationally, collected by the Guggenheim, the Whitney, the Met and the Studio Museum in Harlem; her work has achieved six-figure prices at auction. Her bold, confident creations are designed to challenge preconceptions; at the same time they are often playful, teasing and sensual. Because of the size of her paintings, she often works on the floor, wearing knee pads, and the layering effect achieved through the use of textiles \u2013 and other found materials \u2013 reflects the complexity of the issues she addresses. Self leaves it to the viewer to determine a work\u2019s meaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpedden saw Self\u2019s work at London\u2019s Barbican gallery as part of Unravel: the power and politics of textiles in art, which featured 50 artists who \u201cuse textiles to communicate vital ideas about power, resistance and survival\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s a rock star in the international art world but there\u2019s a lack of knowledge [about her] locally,\u201d McSpedden says. \u201cThis [show] is going to blow your mind.\u201d Tschabalala Self, Candy, 2021. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Pilar Corrias Gallery, London As well as the paintings \u2013 which McSpedden describes as fabric assemblages\u2013 there is a soft sculpture, which depicts two figures embracing, made from fabric. \u201cThe painting style I\u2019ve developed emerged from my print-making practice,\u201d says Self. \u201cI used to do collagraphs, with plates made from non-conventional materials: cardboard, bits of fabric, various materials that create enough of a surface to produce a transfer.\u201d At one stage, she cut up old oil paintings to make prints: \u201cthey had enough peaks and valleys that they could be inked up\u201d. At ACCA, there\u2019s also a three-channel video, a reimagining of a play Self wrote, directed and created sets and costumes for in 2021. \u201cI like to repurpose materials in my practice, so I revisited the documentation of the play and turned it into a non-linear, three channel video,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the new works in the ACCA show are huge. The immersive nature of the show relates to how it is hung: murals created by VCA students, under Self\u2019s direction, will adorn each room, \u201ccreating a psychological space\u201d says McSpedden. Tschabalala Self, Blue Woman, 2025. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Pilar Corrias Gallery, London Making art helps Self articulate the big issues but does it help resolve them? \u201cMaking art is a way of investigating the questions I have; I don\u2019t really know if it helps me resolve these questions. Maybe it does, but then I think there are always more questions that come about in life. What making art does for me and also viewing other people\u2019s art, it gives me the confidence to feel comfortable with the questions. \u201cI think a lot of the dread comes from feeling uncomfortable with having questions. You should feel comfortable to ask the question without the possibility of finding the answer \u2013 a lot of times people have a lot of dread because they can\u2019t fully articulate these questions and it just becomes an impending feeling of doom. \u201cIf they could just allow themselves to have questions, to let the questions linger, unanswered, have faith, give themselves the space to be with them \u2026 I think that\u2019s a healthier way to navigate life. I think the arts allow people that room, that space, that confidence; it allows me to have those experiences and I hope my art does the same for other people.\u201d The show\u2019s title is a double entendre, Self says. \u201cThe words \u2018skin tight\u2019 make you think about a body, curvaceous bodies, automatically you think about the silhouette that exists in my work, and for me that silhouette is important because it represents the pinnacle of the black female beauty standard. That\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind \u2013 the skin tight refers to the reality of identity politics but also the limitations of it.\u201d Tschabalala Self, Submission, 2025. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Pilar Corrias Gallery, London\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe all navigate the world as who we are. I\u2019m a black woman and there are certain expectations and stereotypes, negative and positive, that are attached to that, that people have of me. That\u2019s one of the ways people have to navigate the world, because of their skin. \u201cBut that also barely encompasses the totality, there are aspects to all people which supersede the way in which they show up in the world. And that brings up the existential concerns, this potential for a consciousness, a shared humanity and a spirit that is so much more complex than one\u2019s identity politics.\u201d Loading Self\u2019s parents moved from New Orleans to Harlem, where she and her four siblings grew up. Harlem in the 1990s was a beautiful, amazing place, she says, and for black Americans is a such a place of culture and history and pride. Her Bodega Run series, created in 2017, was inspired by the diversity of people there, as well as taking cues from labels of products on sale on the shelves at her local family-run store, the bodega. \u201cI was thinking about the different racial dynamics between people from African descent from different nations, and how their views on one another and themselves collided every day in the space at the corner store. \u201cIt is something I do like to explore in general within my work, thinking about all the different nuances of black identity and how understandings of blackness do shift, depending on where you are and the context,\u201d Self says. \u201cThe conversation is more complex than just looking at the concept of a black identity and a white identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Beetaloo Energy picked up its pace markedly in May after its development activities were delayed three months by heavy wet-season rains. To get the ball rolling, a $35 million jumbo placement was put away at 16 cents a share before the company fired the starter\u2019s gun to open up its massive horizontal Carpentaria-5H well.\n\nStimulation of the hole roared to life in mid-June. Oilfield heavyweight Halliburton rolled in with a monster 42,000 horsepower spread to punch more than 60 fracture stages into a 3.3-kilometre section of the Velkerri B Shale, making it the biggest fracture attempted in the Beetaloo sub-basin.\n\nBy early July, the program was hailed a resounding success, with Halliburton driving 67 slickwater fracks into the rock at breakneck pace.\n\nWater and sand were pumped underground at more than 100 barrels a minute, cracking open up to five stages a day. In total, a staggering 11,000 tonnes of sand was rammed into the shale - about 337,000 pounds per stage - to keep the fractures wedged wide open.\n\nBeetaloo Energy says the well has now been cleaned out and allowed to soak for a month before the all-important flow testing gets underway. The tests are due to start any day now.\n\nThey will run for 30 days with results expected by late September. A strong performance from C-5H would go a long way towards proving up the basin\u2019s commercial potential, setting the scene for pilot production.\n\nBeetaloo Energy has even more reason to be upbeat right now, after neighbour Tamboran Resources revealed a standout result from its Shenandoah South 2H sidetrack well.\n\nTamboran\u2019s 1671m horizontal well was drilled into the same Velkerri B shale and pumped out an impressive initial rate of 6.8 million cubic feet of gas a day over its first 60 days, easing only slightly to 6.4MMcf/d. In a dramatic twist, production ticked up to 6.5MMcf/d between days 60 and 90 \u2013 without a single downhole tweak and even as wellhead pressure eased.\n\nIn late June, Beetaloo Energy also secured another vital piece of the puzzle when the area\u2019s traditional owners, the Mambaliya Rrumburriya Wuyaliya Aboriginal Land Trust, formally consented to the sale of appraisal gas at an on-country meeting convened by the Northern Land Council.\n\nIf the flow test stacks up, this crucial consent will then unlock the territory government\u2019s vital beneficial use of gas approval \u2013 the green light needed for a final investment decision. That decision in turn will trigger $30 million in Macquarie Bank infrastructure funding to build the pilot plant, setting Beetaloo on course for first shale gas production in the second quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has locked in a weighty $65 million funding package, with $30 million earmarked for a research and development facility to supercharge its next growth phase. The cash injection will bankroll exploration, appraisal and development drilling \u2013 including the high-impact Carpentaria-5H well, while also covering the build-out of vital infield infrastructure to keep the project\u2019s momentum rolling.\n\nOf course, nothing is certain in the notoriously fickle oil and gas game. But should C-5H prove up commercial rates, it could spark a rush of interest from the majors \u2013 particularly United States shale veterans eyeing a basin some believe could host as much as 500 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n\nFor punters, the coming months promise to be pivotal. If the flow rates meet expectations, the company could lock in its place as the Northern Territory\u2019s first onshore shale gas producer \u2013 putting it firmly in the national energy spotlight.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

    "text": "South Korean intelligence officials believe that Kim most likely has two children. There have also been unconfirmed reports that he might have a third child, possibly a son older than Ju-ae. But Ju-ae is the only child who has made public appearances. If she is her father\u2019s designated successor, she would be in line to become the first woman to rule North Korea\u2019s deeply patriarchal and highly militarised society and the world\u2019s newest nuclear power. Kim is only 41, but with a family history of heart trouble, preparing a successor makes sense. Here is a look at Ju-ae\u2019s rise. Taking the Stage Ju-ae has undergone a striking transformation in the country\u2019s tightly choreographed state media. Intelligence officials and analysts in South Korea caution against firm conclusions about her future role. But as her profile has risen, she has eclipsed her mother and Kim\u2019s powerful sister Kim Yo-jong, also once considered a potential successor, as the main female face of the ruling family.\n\nLoading A New Look Ju-ae\u2019s birth and name were first revealed to the outside world by retired NBA star Dennis Rodman, who met the Kim family during a visit to North Korea in 2013. When she made her first public appearance in 2022 in a white padded winter jacket, Ju-ae looked no different from the other children of the elites in Pyongyang. But as she has grown, her clothes have become more formal, and she has been transformed into a figure of authority. Her wardrobe now includes tailored leather coats with fur collars and two-piece designer suits. As her mother has receded from public view, Ju-ae has begun to adopt her sense of fashion.\n\nHer mannerisms and demeanour have also changed. Even something as small as how she claps looks different now than it did two years ago. \u201cThe child who first appeared as a family curiosity is now a polished, rehearsed figure woven into North Korea\u2019s ongoing story of dynastic power,\u201d said Donald Southerton, the author of Korea 101. \u201cEach photo, parade walk and salute I see as a carefully staged story of succession, legitimacy and continuity for the Kim dynasty.\u201d Should a brother emerge, Ju-ae may end up serving as a mere placeholder, said Kang Dong-wan, an expert on North Korea at Dong-A University in South Korea. For now, though, her prominent portrayal is sending a message to North Koreans that the Kim family rule will continue into a fourth generation. This photo was provided by the North Korean government and shows Kim Jong-un, centre, with his daughter, Kim Ju-ae, reviewing the honour guard during their visit to naval headquarters in 2023. Credit: AP Her Main Inheritance\n\nKim chose the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, for his daughter\u2019s public debut in November 2022. Since that day, he has taken her to other nuclear-related sites, introducing her to officials involved in North Korea\u2019s weapons programs. He has lauded the arsenal as a major legacy of the family\u2019s rule. When Kim himself was being groomed to succeed his father, he first established his authority with the military, the key to maintaining power. Now, by taking Ju-ae to military events, Kim has been showing her how he handles the top brass. He has also offered senior military officers opportunities to meet and show loyalty to her, analysts said. Three months after her first appearance, she attended a military parade, walking with her parents and followed by the top brass. And this year, she attended the launch of the Kang Kon, one of the North Korean navy\u2019s new destroyers, standing near her father and top officials.\n\nKim\u2019s health By preparing a successor publicly from an early age, Kim may be trying to avoid the mistake his father made, analysts say. It was not until after his father had a stroke in 2008 that Kim was unveiled as the heir apparent. That led to uncertainty about the younger Kim. In his early years, he faced scepticism from outside analysts who dismissed him as an inexperienced leader and argued that he would not last long. In this photo provided by the North Korean government, Kim Jong-un, his wife, Ri Sol-ju, right, and his daughter, Kim Ju-ae, attend a feast to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding Korean People\u2019s Army in 2023. Credit: AP That was before Kim executed his uncle, had his half-brother assassinated by his agents in Malaysia and purged several top generals to establish his unchallenged authority.\n\nNow it is primarily Kim\u2019s health, not his hold on power, that is in question. He is about 1.7m tall and weighs about 140kg, according to South Korean intelligence officials. They added that he had unhealthy habits, including chain-smoking, heavy wining and dining, and frequently staying up into the early morning to surf the internet, where he likes to browse weapons sites. Loading Kim is believed to have cardiovascular issues, which contributed to the deaths of his father and grandfather. One advantage to grooming a successor early, even a young child, is leverage against his American and South Korean adversaries, said Sung-Yoon Lee, the author of The Sister: North Korea\u2019s Kim Yo-jong, the Most Dangerous Woman in the World. \u201cIt tells them, \u2018We have all the time in the world, while you are bound by term limits of four to five years,\u2019\u201d Lee said.",

    "text": "Federal Aged Care Minister Sam Rae was heavily questioned in parliament earlier this week for delaying the release of 83,000 new home care packages from 1 July to 1 November.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of March, more than 289,000 older Australians had a home care package. But more Australians need these services than there are places, so the wait list continues to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nReacting to widespread complaints, the Senate stepped in to conduct a short inquiry into the impact of the delay on older Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research and submission to the Senate inquiry show the government should immediately release the additional packages. But its not yet clear whether it will do so.\n\n\n\nWhat are home care packages?\n\nHome care packages are bundles of services that help older people with complex needs to live at home for longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four levels of funding, depending on need. Each package can include help with household tasks, but there is also an emphasis on personal and clinical care, including nursing, physiotherapy and other allied health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2021 Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety recommended the government significantly increase the number of home care packages, as it was clear older people wanted to stay at home for as long as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found in-home care can prevent the avoidable decline of older people\u2019s health and independence, enable them to remain a part of their local community, and delay (or avoid) entry into residential aged care or hospital.\n\n\n\nThe waiting list went down. Now it's up again\n\nThe number of people receiving a home care package increased from 128,781 at the end of 2019 to 258,374 in June 2023. During that time the government was releasing 40,000 to 50,000 packages per quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis exceeded the number of people being approved for packages. So the waiting list was declining by as much as 10,000 people per quarter, reaching a low of 28,665 by June 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of people with a home care package and waiting for a home care package\n\n\n\nNumber of people with a home care package and waiting for a home care package. Source: The Conversation / UTS Ageing Research Collaborative However, from mid-2023 the government reduced the release of new packages to a little over 30,000 per quarter. Meanwhile, the number of older people being approved for a package continued to grow in line with Australia\u2019s ageing population.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, waiting lists rose strongly each quarter and reached 87,597 by March 2025.\n\n\n\nWhat was due to start in July?\n\nWith pressure mounting from the sector, the then-minister for aged care announced in November 2024 that a new Aged Care Act would start in July 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would include significant reform to in-home aged care, including a new Support at Home program, as well as significant reforms to residential aged care facilities and how they\u2019re funded.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the reforms, the government committed to funding an additional 83,000 home care packages in 2025\u201326. This was a marked increase on the 24,000 in 2024\u201325.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government also committed to reducing wait times to an average of three months by 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the start of the new Aged Care Act 2024 \u2014 and the rollout of the 83,000 additional packages \u2014 was subsequently deferred until November 1 2025. At the time, the government said the supporting regulation was not fully ready for consideration by Parliament in time to allow older people, providers and the workforce to prepare for the changes.\n\n\n\nWhat has the Senate inquiry found so far?\n\nThe Senate inquiry investigating the impact on older Australians is due to report on 15 September.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a submission to the inquiry, the former Inspector-General of Aged Care said the care wait list continued to spiral upwards and was forecast to exceed 102,000 by the end of October 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn evidence to the inquiry on Friday, the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing confirmed that when an existing package became vacant it was re-released to a new client. However, there had been no increase in the overall number of packages since the beginning of July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe department also advised that at the end of July 121,596 people were waiting for an assessment and more than 87,000 have been assessed but have not received their package.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the wait list grows, the time that older Australians are having to wait is getting longer. The department\u2019s submission reported that older people assessed as medium priority have an estimated wait time, across all packages, of 9\u201312 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the government\u2019s data refers only to the time taken between being assessed for home care and being assigned a package. Older people also have to wait another month or more, on average, between applying to be assessed and having that assessment. Then there is, on average, another month between being assigned a package and having the first service actually delivered.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater transparency about how long older people actually have to wait would help hold the government to account.\n\n\n\nLonger-term issues yet to be addressed\n\nThe release of some of the 83,000 packages over the next two months would make a short-term dent in the current wait list, although this gain will largely disappear when some of the backlog of 120,000 people waiting to be assessed is finally tackled.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut adding more packages doesn\u2019t go far enough to address the long-term aged care structural issues facing older people and taxpayers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growing demand for in-home aged care is being driven by the influx of Baby Boomers over the next two decades (the oldest are currently aged 79) and by increases in chronic illnesses, such as those arising from greater obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese drivers will place growing stress on the ability of constrained government budgets to increase the supply of services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe availability of a skilled and committed workforce to deliver the services is yet another challenge, which is economy-wide and needs to be addressed if the system is to meet the rising demands for home-based care.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Woods receives funding from government agencies to conduct research on aged care policy.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the village of Tha Ton, nestled in the hills just three kilometres from Thailand\u2019s border with Myanmar, there is little to life without the Kok River.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor hundreds of years, it has provided fish for their families, water for their crops and, in the stifling summer heat, a place for their children to cool down.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Gob Kotekham, it\u2019s where he\u2019s been making rafts all his life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery year when I make the rafts, I might get a rash or two, but within a week it would go away. This time, there were a lot of rashes and they kept spreading. It was itchy; I had never felt that before. At first, I thought I was allergic to something, but then the people who were helping me with the rafts got sick as well. My friend got cut, and his wound wouldn\u2019t heal. Another person went into the water and felt feverish. Then, after two months it still hadn\u2019t gone away, so I went to see the doctor.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBy that point, the Kok River was turning a strange shade of orange, and the reports of illness were becoming difficult to ignore.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo children, aged two and six years old, became sick after eating fish from the river. Test results showed abnormally high levels of arsenic in their bodies. Fish began washing up dead, and fishermen started reporting odd deformities among their daily catch. Elephants that had long been bathed in the river began to develop unusual skin rashes and boils.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials from Thailand\u2019s Pollution Control Department came to test the water. They discovered arsenic levels three times higher than the safe limit.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal authorities then ordered everyone to stay out of the water, putting this village\u2019s largest source of income off limits - and putting Mr Kotekham in debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I made the rafts, I had to buy wood. I invested around 50-60,000 baht, and this year, there is no one coming - not a single customer. So, we are all in debt. Not just me; the whole village.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEight successive rounds of water testing have now confirmed dangerously high levels of arsenic in the Kok River.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first, it was widely blamed on gold mining upstream in Myanmar; a common cause of arsenic contamination.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, researchers at the Shan Human Rights foundation saw satellite images showing two rare earth mining sites over the border in southern Shan State, where the Kok River originates.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokesperson for the group Sai Hark Jet says the mining sites sit between two and three kilometres from the river's banks, in territory under the control of the United Wa State Army; Shan State's most powerful militia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also compared them with the rare earth mining in Kachin, and the layout of the leeching pools are the same. So, we said that this is not just ordinary mineral extraction or mining, this must be tied up with rare earth mining in Kachin State. We also have heard from local people that all the water is very brown and they cannot use it anymore, but they have to because they have no other water source. The community in Shan State dare not speak up, because of the local authority.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Wa State Army has not responded to SBS's requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nRare earth mining uses chemicals to separate the valuable minerals from their ore. The process leaves behind a highly contaminated liquids that often finds their way back into the environment\u2019s waterways if care is not taken to contain them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThai authorities say they are working on plans to urgently install sediment traps in the Kok River to stop the arsenic flowing downstream.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut local leaders in Tha Ton fear that alone will not solve this crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal monk Phra Mahanikom wants to see Bangkok engage directly with Myanmar\u2019s military leaders in Naypyidaw to end all unregulated mining across the border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we just try to solve the problem by reviving the river without closing the mines, we cannot solve the issue. And if it cannot be fixed, then the community will change. Our way of life will change.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPhra Mahanikom was born and raised in Tha Ton. After moving away to study, he returned to preside over Wat Tha Ton; a temple perched on a hilltop that overlooks the village and its river.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI bathed in the Kok River on the day I was born. The day I first hear the news, I went onto the bridge and I looked out onto the river. It was muddy, very muddy. That day, I felt like my mother was in the ICU and I was behind the glass doors. I couldn\u2019t speak to her, I couldn\u2019t touch her, I couldn\u2019t give her support, even one bit. That\u2019s how I felt.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTha Ton is a village of less than 20,000 people. Almost all of them rely on the river in one way or another for their survival.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now, during the wet season, there is enough water running off the region\u2019s mountains to keep their crops watered. But soon, the village will once again need to rely on water from the river.\n\n\n\n\n\na Boonruang has lived in the same house right beside the Kok River for more than 50 years. He says farming and fishing is all he has ever known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore, if we didn\u2019t have enough water, we could just go get it from the river and carry it to our farms. But now, it is very dangerous. It impacts everyone. Not just one person, not just the whole village, the whole river - however many kilometres it is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contamination has already spread further than that. After it passes through Tha Ton, the Kok River empties into the Mekong - Southeast Asia\u2019s most important waterway - where abnormally high levels of arsenic have already been detected.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, Thai authorities have taken water samples from three locations spanning a roughly 20 kilometre stretch of the Mekong River.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll have shown arsenic levels exceeding the safe limit.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the small village of Ban Sob Kok, about 15 kilometres downstream from the border with Myanmar, local fisherman Somdet Thanatulayakul says they have already started finding deformed fish in their daily catch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were some fish with scars. We saw them, so we didn\u2019t eat them, but they took them for testing, and when they came back, they had the arsenic. Buyers are now afraid to eat the fish because of the news. Before, I could earn more than 1000 baht per day, but now, we can\u2019t even get 300 baht in a week.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is now growing evidence rare earth mining is causing the contamination crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thai Government commissioned Naresuan University Associate Professor Tanapon Phenrat to study the water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe took water, soil, sediment and some edible plants together with fish from five stations in Chiang Rai. We quantified around 15 types of elements or ions in water samples. Then we compared the \u2018fingerprints of chemicals\u2019 - which is the ratio of different elements - with the water samples we got from rare earth mining in Kachin. The concentration in Thailand is lower, but the ratio of chemicals are still similar. This should lead to the conclusion, or at least the identification, that it has to do mostly with rare earth mining.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping by the Thai Governemnt's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency has now detected 60 disturbed earth sites across Shan State with suspected links to mining, 21 of which it says are newly active this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t distinguish between regular mines and rare earth mines, but the Shan Human Rights Foundation says its mapping has detected a total of 47 rare earth mining sites across Shan State.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of them are close to neighbouring China, which imported a record high of nearly 42,000 metric tonnes of rare earths from Myanmar in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, Associate Professor Tanapon says the arsenic levels detected in the Mekong River are still far lower than that found in three of its tributaries that originate in Myanmar's Shan State; the Kok, Sai and Ruak rivers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he believes we are not yet seeing the full impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPollutants take time to transport. When we say arsenic, lead, they are in particulates, they are in small sediments that form in the river. These things do not transport as fast as water. It will form more particulates, more sediment and will transport, wave by wave, there will be more impact for sure. This is not at a steady state yet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThailand, Laos and Myanmar all meet on the Mekong River. It then continues downstream into Cambodia and Vietnam, supporting 60 million people through fisheries, agriculture and drinking water before emptying into the South China Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is how far environmentalist Pianporn Deetes from NGO International Rivers is warning the contamination could spread if it is not contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the largest environmental crime I have ever experienced. It is long-term violence. The result might not be seen within a year or two, but it might show itself in the next three, five or 10 years with the newborns. Public health is the most concerning issue for us. We don\u2019t want to see our future generations be sick.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThai activists believe Chinese investors are largely behind the surge in mining across Shan State.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeijing controls roughly 70 per cent of rare earth mining operations globally, and accounts for 90 per cent of their processing, during which the minerals are converted into elements used in a wide range of modern technologies, including smartphones, weapons systems and rechargeable batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June, China's embassy in Bangkok responded to the contamination reports, saying: \"China has instructed Chinese companies operating abroad to comply with the laws of the country and operate legally at all times.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ms Deetes says most of the mining sites identified are in areas outside the control of Myanmar's military government, meaning any environmental regulations would be impossible to enforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening in an area where there are no laws or even rules on safety standards. This is just the beginning of the disaster. We\u2019ve learned from Kachin State that 300 legal or illegal mines happening with investors from China or Chinese-speaking investors. On our river headwaters, there are just a few. But there will be more and more coming if there is no action from governments. The costs are being paid by our rivers, our forests, our lands, and our futures.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But they help us, so that we are not suffering from that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key aspect of the 'Welcome Experience' involves helping essential workers foster social connections, including connecting to sports clubs, community groups and events.\n\n\n\n\n\nFatemeh and her husband Saeed recently attending their local pub trivia night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have good communication with new friends, and with new people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt provides us an opportunity to see other people in the community which we cannot usually meet them in our workplace or when we go to the gym ... It helps a lot, making good friends.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Welcome Experience' community connector co-ordinator, Katrina Kiely:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe success of this service is, it's that human connection. And that can't be replicated. If someone is moving to town, sure they can Google, or they can ChatGPT schools or services or where to get their services in, but that actual interaction with a human who understands and has empathy, that's irreplaceable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as huge investments are being made for the region to phase out mining and transition to renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new solar farm and battery energy storage system, currently under development, is set to power up to 60,000 homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuswellbrook Shire Mayor Jeff Drayton says by 2030, most of the mining in the Shire will be replaced with other industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn four and a half years time, we lose 60 per cent of our mining and we've gotta replace that with lots and lots of other industries and lots of jobs. So it is critical for us that the government continue to support us, and to support this program.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport that can make all the difference to an ever-evolving community.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-six kilometres southwest of Muswellbrook lies the town of Denman, where Asha Thomas works as a registered nurse at the local hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally from India, she migrated to Australia in March of 2024, after working as an RN in the UK for three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was my dream to come to Australia ... I love it. Because, I just love the quiet environment and it's a small community, so I thought I would just take that chance to come here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough the Welcome Experience, council enlisted the help of the local Men's Shed, to help set up furniture for Asha, her husband and their son in their new home.\n\n\n\n\n\nRod Johnson and Tony Forr from the Men's Shed recounting the ordeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe undid the flat-pack and then scratched our heads for about half an hour looking at the instructions. I think most things we had three goes at getting it right, but we eventually got it right.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you can help someone out, why not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAsha says she was shocked by the lengths they went to, to help.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Key Points Virgin and Qantas customers risk flight credits running out if they are not used.\n\nVirgin Australia holds $93 million worth of outstanding COVID-19 flight credits.\n\nQantas is holding a further $358 million.\n\nVirgin Australia customers with travel credits are being urged to use them before June 2026 to avoid their value being lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its 2026 financial year outlook, Virgin Australia revealed that it holds $93 million worth of outstanding COVID-19 flight credits, which are set to expire on 30 June 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nPassengers with travel credits will need to not only book, but also fly before the end of June 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Qantas is holding $358 million in outstanding flight credits for its COVID-19-induced cancelled flights, which comprise both Qantas and Jetstar Airlines.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's how to check whether you have travel credits, when they expire, and how you can use them.\n\n\n\nWhat are COVID-19 travel credits?\n\nIf the pandemic put a dampener on your travel plans, you may have COVID-19 flight credits, which were issued by airlines to customers when flights were cancelled due to the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlight credits are given to customers when a flight is cancelled, with the amount spent on the tickets held by the airline and redeemable at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome airlines offer these as vouchers redeemable for other flights, while others provide a cash refund.\n\n\n\nWhen do the travel credits expire?\n\nThat all depends on who your credits are with.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, many of the issued travel credits had an expiry date.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, several airlines, including Qantas and Jetstar, have decided to scrap expiry dates. Now, those passengers can use them whenever they like with no expiration.\n\n\n\nBut airlines like Virgin Australia have a set expiry limit of 30 June 2026. These customers will need to book a flight before then, otherwise their money could go down the drain.\n\n\n\n\n\nVirgin Australia have outlined: \"All COVID Credit Tickets must be exchanged on or before 30 JUN 2026, subject to travel occurring by 30 JUN 2026.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means that you'll not only need to book flights before those dates \u2014 you'll also need to fly before then.\n\n\n\nHow do I know if I have COVID-19 travel credits?\n\nQantas customers can use their 'Find My Credit' search tool. All you'll need is the last name of the traveller, the email associated with the booking, and a booking reference number.\n\n\n\n\n\nJetstar Airways customers should have received an email with information about any credit vouchers. You can check how much credit you have on their portal .\n\n\n\n\n\nVirgin Australia passengers will have their travel credit stored in the 'Travel Bank', with any affected customers having already had an account created on their behalf. You can search your credit balance and learn how to book flights on their portal .\n\n\n\nCan you get refunds?\n\nThat depends on who you're with.\n\n\n\n\n\nQantas customers holding COVID-19 credits can request a cash refund at any time, with no expiry date.\n\n\n\n\n\nJetstar passengers aren't eligible for cash refunds, but can use their COVID-19 vouchers for flights indefinitely.\n\n\n\nVirgin Australia travel credits are limited to booking flights. Those hoping for a refund will need to apply via their refund application form.\n\n\n\nClass action against airlines underway\n\nJetstar and Qantas are facing class action lawsuits on behalf of customers whose flights were cancelled during the pandemic, and who were only issued a travel credit.\n\n\n\n\n\nEcho Law is leading both class actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe action against Qantas alleged the airline issued the majority of its customers with travel credits or vouchers, which were subject to significant restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Accordingly, those credits were of much lower value to customers than the refunds to which they were entitled,\" according to information about the class action on Echo Law's website.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trial date could be pushed to the end of 2026 or early 2027.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, a class action lawsuit was also launched against Jetstar, alleging the airline failed to refund money to customers, despite being legally obligated to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Jetstar promotes itself as a values-driven, low-fare airline committed to helping 'more people fly, more often', yet it's a highly profitable part of the Qantas Group, and when COVID caused widespread flight cancellations, it put those profits ahead of its customers' interests,\" Andrew Paull, a partner at Echo Law, said in a press release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Jetstar customers were pushed into holding hundreds of millions of dollars in restricted travel credits, even though this wasn't what those customers had agreed to as part of the airline's terms and conditions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has previously issued warnings to some airlines regarding their cancellation practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2023, the regulator launched legal action against Qantas for allegedly selling tickets for thousands of flights it had already cancelled.\n\n\n\n\n\nHours later, Qantas removed the expiry dates on COVID-19 travel credits, which were initially set to expire at the end of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen-Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said: \"We know the credit system was not as smooth as it should have been. And, while we've improved it recently and extended the expiry date several times, people lost faith in the process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These credits and vouchers will never expire,\" Joyce said in a video statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nA week later, Joyce stood down as Qantas chief executive.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo class action has been taken against Virgin Australia.\n\n\n\n",

Or extinction?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Barrie is the former Defence Force chief and executive member of The Australian Security Leaders Climate Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Australia navigates its way through an uncertain and tense geopolitical landscape, he says there is no greater threat than climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are suggesting that the Australian Government turn back the diary by about 30 years and take a leadership role in the international community by making climate change front and center of Australian foreign policy. It will not only be good for us here in Australia, that will be good for our region too, where a lot of people expect countries like ours to step up when there's a need. And looking at the tea leaves and right now, that need is very apparent. For me, we're going entering a very dangerous period where the United States simply does not care about all of us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA report from The Australian Security Leaders Climate Group, titled 'A Climate First Foreign Policy For Australia', says climate disruption is Australia's greatest threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, climate change is not only an existential global threat but an immediate national security threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Colonel in the Australian Army, Neil Greet says Australia won't be able to defend itself from anything if it has to tackle increasing extreme weather events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about foreign policy and climate change, it is about catastrophic events that are concurrent. If something happens in the region at the same time something happens domestically, then we have immense problems. And so that is our challenge right now. South Australia is suffering the same problem, flood in the north, drought in the middle, and a sea algal bloom, that's causing catastrophic events in South Australia, so catastrophic and concurrent. It can happen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOver in the Senate, the Greens and some members of the crossbench are trying to order the government to release the National Climate Risk Assessment and National Adaptation Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Climate Risk Assessment, commissioned by the government in 2022 to investigate national security threats posed by global heating, was never released.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters says Australia's future will be very grim without urgent action to curb climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Greens' pressure and this Senate has ordered Labor to release the National Climate Risk Assessment Report. And brave whistleblowers who have seen the climate risk report say that it details a future where we face a world on track for three degrees of warming, which means 50 degree days in Sydney and Melbourne. It means homes within five kilometers of the coast, which is much of us facing regular flooding and inundation, much of the country stuck in drought, leading to crop shortages and price spikes for essentials and all coral reefs dead.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government, which will release its emissions targets for 2035 in September, says the risk report will also be made public in September.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Senator David Pocock says releasing the risk assessment after announcing new targets is unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis shows, which communities will face unbearable heat, which coastlines we'll lose and which parts of our economy will buckle under climate pressure. Insiders have called its findings dire and diabolical, yet the government is keeping it locked away. Keeping Australians in the dark about the risks to their homes their livelihoods and their safety. How can people judge whether the 2035 target is strong enough if they can't even see the facts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minister representing the energy minister, Tim Ayres, says the order was a political stunt and diminishes the power of the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'll give you the tip, the way that you do it is you try to do it in a way that has impact. Because what this will do is have zero impact. Zero impact. Because it doesn't have the gravity, the seriousness, the moral seriousness, that that you are trying to confect. As the Senate is aware from the public comments made by the minister both the national climate risk assessment and the national adaptation plan will be released in September.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso in the Senate today, National Senator Matt Canavan announced plans to introduce a separate bill to repeal net zero emission targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Canavan's bill is separate from the one introduced in the House by Nationals M-P Barnaby Joyce.\n\n\n\n\n\nDismissing the expert warnings, Mr Canavan told Sky News that achieving net zero will do nothing for Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI do intend to introduce that into the Senate as well, because I think, as I've said for a long time, it's high time our country had a proper debate about this. As I just mentioned, we were promised when net zero was signed up to, we were promised lower power bills. That hasn't happened. We were promised lots of jobs in critical minerals. Instead, we're losing industries hand over fist, with the risk of losing more in a very, very short space of time, so look I just don't think this thing is working, and it's about time it gets put under the microscope, we have a debate. And we give the Australian people a choice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a July YouGov poll, more than half of voters who had previously voted for the Coalition, but decided not to in 2025, say they were deterred by their policy on climate, renewables and housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nDivision over net zero appears to be widening in the Coalition, with both the Liberals and the Nationals reviewing net zero policies after their May election loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Party appointed Matt Canavan, an outspoken critic of net zero, to an internal committee tasked with reviewing the party\u2019s policy on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking full advantage of the divisions, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says that while the coalition fights with itself, his government is pushing forward on climate change.\n\n\n\n",

I lost seven of my family's children including five girls and two boys. And three of my cousins were martyred too, and one uncle as well as some of my other relatives. In short, our village has 200 to 250 casualties.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar, homes made of mud bricks and wood have crumbled into ruins, entire villages destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt latest count, more than 800 people are dead, at least 2,500 injured.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd as aftershocks continue to rumble across scenes of destruction, desperate residents search for missing loved ones, with the death toll expected to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal resident Shahid Khan was buried under the rubble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were under the soil. The Muslims came and rescued us. My wife, my son, my nephew, and my grandchildren were all buried under the destroyed house. This was God's test of us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary helicopters ferry out the injured, while residents help security forces and medics carry the wounded to ambulances.\n\n\n\n\n\nHospitals are already crammed, doctors and nurses working frantically amid the constant flow of stretchers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a perilous rescue operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nRough mountainous areas are cut off from mobile reception, some impassable due to landslides.\n\n\n\n\n\nClouds above carry the ongoing threat of heavy rain, while animal carcasses risk contaminating water resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents beg the Taliban government for help, though its resources are already depleted.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the administration took control in 2021, they've grappled with a sharp drop in foreign aid that formed the bulk of their finances.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan is one of the poorest nations in the world \u2014 and no stranger to powerful earthquakes with a magnitude over 7. Since 1900, the eastern part of the country has seen 12 of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd with effects of the climate change, they're expected to become even more frequent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharafat Zaman, spokesman for the health ministry in Kabul, called for international aid to tackle the devastation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We urgently call on humanitarian organisations to step in and provide immediate support so the residents of the affected areas can be protected from further tragedies. Humanitarian organisations are also urged to assist in preventing the spread of communicable diseases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghan Australian Shams Mamond was in Jalabad City in Eastern Afghanistan when the earthquake struck.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe travelled to one of the affected districts in neighbouring Kunar province, sharing his experiences with SBS Pashto.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was in Jalalabad [city] when the earthquake struck. The shaking was very strong and terrifying, it felt like the whole ground was moving beneath us. People were running out of their homes in panic and many buildings were damaged.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Mamond urged the Australian government to help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy humble request from the Australian government is to urgently send humanitarian aid \u2014 food, medicine, tents, and other emergency support \u2014 for the people of Kunar. At the same time, I hope Australia will also help with long-term recovery, so these families can rebuild their lives with dignity.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Something to look forward to: The Power should be back in the finals hunt next year, but they will need to get busy in the trade period. Do they have enough true stars? Missing out on Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera will hurt. Late season injuries have given the youngsters a chance. We like what we have seen of Jack Whitlock, who can play ruck and go forward. Best and fairest winner: Zak Butters.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nEssendon (15th)\n\nWins: 6. Losses: 17. Draft picks: 4, 5, 22, 25. What went well: The Bombers have some superb youngsters. In his second year, Nate Caddy again gave glimpses of the player he could become, with 20 goals and more flashes of brilliance. Isaac Kako gave Bombers fans something to get excited about. Credit: AFL Photos Isaac Kako impressed with his smarts around goals and showed late in the season he can also be developed as a pinch-hitter in the centre square.\n\nArchie Roberts, the lowest draft pick of the trio, could end up being a steal. The teenager is advanced beyond his years, demonstrating composure and skill in a defence that was under siege. Angus Clarke is another of the club\u2019s 15 debutants this year who has provided Bombers fans with hope in a wretched campaign. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Ben Hobbs. In his fourth season, Hobbs, 21, failed to take a more significant role in the side. Worryingly for Hobbs, despite Essendon\u2019s litany of injuries, he was dropped for the first leg of the final round and could not break back into the team. Hobbs has stagnated in his past two seasons, reaching 20 disposals in just three of his past 30 games. His disposal remains a worry. If time has run out for the first-round pick from the 2021 draft, it would raise further queries on the Bombers\u2019 recruiting and player development.\n\nSomething to look forward to: The draft. The Bombers have a strong hand in this year\u2019s draft after acquiring Melbourne\u2019s first selection through a pick swap last year. Even accounting for father/son, academy and NGA picks, the Bombers should have access to two very good youngsters. If Sam Draper departs through free agency, that should deliver another first-round pick. Unfortunately for the Dons, this is not considered the strongest draft, but one experienced recruiter has said they would not be surprised if smokies emerge deeper in the pool. Best and fairest: Zach Merrett.\n\n-Andrew Wu West Coast (18th)\n\nWins: 1. Losses: 22. Draft picks: 1, 14, 19, 32, 50. What went well: Sorry West Coast fans, this is not pretty. The Eagles have managed 11 wins in four seasons, including just one victory, over St Kilda, in a torturous 2025 season. But there\u2019s always a glimmer of hope and performances and players to celebrate. Two-time Richmond premiership player Jack Graham, who joined the Eagles for 2025, comfortably exceeded his career average for disposals (19.2 possessions per game this season) and had 7.8 tackles per game (which is considered \u201celite\u201d).\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: The defensive unit and the defence coaches. West Coast comfortably conceded the highest number of points (2438) this season, leaving them with a limp percentage of 60.1. If premierships are built from the backline, they need to focus there. It will be fascinating to see the club\u2019s attitude towards Tim Kelly, who played 19 games in his sixth season with the Eagles. Something to look forward to: It couldn\u2019t get any worse, could it? If West Coast haven\u2019t bottomed out, where is the bottom? The Eagles can expect the No.2 draft pick as compensation for losing free agent Oscar Allen to Brisbane, so that\u2019s something. And Harley Reid is staying for now, having resisted interest from big Victorian clubs to extend until the end of 2028. Eagles fans can only look forward to better times ahead.\n\nBest and fairest tip: Jack Graham.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits North Melbourne (16th) Wins: 5 Losses: 17 Draws: 1 Draft picks: 20, 21, 39, 57 What went well: They made it out of the bottom two! The Kangaroos and coach Alastair Clarkson would have liked to see more progress on the ladder, but he remains bullish they are heading in the right direction.\n\nNorth Melbourne avoided another bottom-two finish. Credit: Getty Images After a torrid first six rounds and the odd thrashing beyond that, North were generally more competitive, including securing a draw with Brisbane, but there were no statement wins. Instead, they would be pleased with Harry Sheezel\u2019s transition to a midfield-forward role, the continued development of Colby McKercher and career-best seasons from Cam Zurhaar and Paul Curtis. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Will Phillips. The No.3 pick in the COVID-19-impacted 2020 draft class played only seven matches this season and does not appear to be in the Roos\u2019 plans. He should latch on somewhere, but needs to get going to save his career.\n\nSomething to look forward to: Next year promises to be the season when North Melbourne finally take a genuine leap. How high that is remains to be seen, but the expectations must rise, even if that is as modest as aiming for between eight and 10 wins. The young talent is there, and they may have finally found Nick Larkey\u2019s sidekick in Cooper Trembath. A stiffer defence and another progression from their midfield group should enable them to take another belated step. Best and fairest: Luke Davies-Uniacke.\n\n- Marc McGowan\n\nRichmond (17th) Wins: 5. Losses: 18. Draft picks: 2,3 What went well: Plenty for a club that was widely tipped to sail through turbulent waters with a drastically young and inexperienced list. The season began on the best note possible with a stunning round-one win over Carlton. The nature of the victory, a come-from-behind triumph, set the tone for the season for both the Tigers and Blues. Throw in highlights from Maurice Rioli jnr, and all was swell. Tim Taranto had a strong season as one of the Tigers\u2019 on-field leaders. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: The club\u2019s forwards and the forward coaches. The Tigers scored the fewest number of points (1449), less even than West Coast, a club that limped to one victory, compared to Richmond\u2019s five. Veteran spearhead Tom Lynch could cop a drive-by sledge for missing games. He played only 16 matches (due largely to a suspension) after a tough couple of years with injuries. Something to look forward to: There\u2019s so much to look forward to. Realistically, the Tigers will battle to replicate their win-loss tally (5-18) as they continue to develop their young group.\n\nIt could be a case of the \u201csecond-year blues\u201d for a host of players. But Richmond will be eyeing off their matches against Carlton and the chance to knock them off again. Best and fairest tip: Tim Taranto.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits St Kilda (12th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 7, 43, 58. What went well: The Saints were a popular choice to sink into the bottom four, but finished three wins clear of that territory while prioritising youth.\n\nThe Saints will welcome Tom De Koning in 2026 and welcome back Max King after another injury-riddled season. Credit: AFL Photos St Kilda\u2019s round two upset of Geelong was a false dawn, but a peek at their upside. They also demolished Fremantle and executed the greatest three-quarter-time comeback from 46 points down against Melbourne. That latter win was the first of four in a row before they almost upset GWS in round 24. Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s emergence as a top-liner was massive, while Max Hall followed Cooper Sharman and Max Heath as a mid-season draft success story.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Zak Jones. The brother of ex-Demons captain Nathan was not one of the five Saints who re-signed last week, and faces an uncertain future. Jones turns 31 in March, and St Kilda already made it clear they want to get younger in the midfield. Something to look forward to: Another two years from Wanganeen-Milera, who they retained despite Adelaide and Port Adelaide wanting him. There is optimism about what Mattaes Phillipou, Darcy Wilson, Alix Tauru and Tobie Travaglia can become, while the likes of Hugo Garcia, Isaac Keeler, Hugh Boxshall and Lance Collard also show promise. Tom De Koning will be on the list in 2026, and Max King will hopefully be fit again. Best and fairest tip: Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan\n\nSydney (10th) Wins: 12. Losses: 11. Draft picks: 9, 27, 45, 63. What went well: Having won just four of their first 12 games under new coach Dean Cox, the Swans showed fortitude to rebound and win eight of their final 11 games. Brodie Grundy returned to his best form for Sydney in 2025. Credit: AFL Photos Playmaker Isaac Heeney had a tough start, but then reminded everyone why he is a legitimate star.\n\nChad Warner was a consistent threat through the midfield, but did not have the impact he enjoyed through 2022-24. A serious ankle injury through the pre-season sidelined Errol Gulden for months and seriously hurt the Swans\u2019 midfield and creative drive, just as his return in round 15 had the reverse effect. Brodie Grundy reinforced why he is one of the competition\u2019s premier ruckmen. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Skipper Callum Mills. For the Swans to make the leap next season, Mills needs to consistently be on the park. His 2024 campaign was derailed after injuring his rotator cuff in a Mad Monday celebration. He missed the first half of this year because of plantar fascia. He needs to lead the way in 2026. Something to look forward to: This has been a year of recalibration for the Swans, and learning, particularly for Cox, who is now more at ease in the top role after replacing John Longmire.\n\nWhile it feels somewhat of a wasted year, the Swans are still in top-four mode, and are likely to be strengthened through the trade period. They just need to get moving earlier next season. Best and fairest tip: Isaac Heeney.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Carlton (11th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 34, 44, 62*.\n\nWhat went well: Not much. George Hewett was one of few Blues to exceed expectations, putting together a career-best season in the midfield. Jack Silvagni and Tom De Koning are both leaving the Blues. Credit: Getty Images Better known as a defensive onballer, Hewett became a prolific ball-winner in his own right. In his 12th season on an AFL list, the former Swan is a strong chance to win his first best and fairest award. Veteran Nick Haynes overcame a horror start at the club to become dependable defender. He deserves another year. Young midfielder Cooper Lord is one to watch. George Hewett stepped up for the Blues in 2025, but didn\u2019t get enough support. Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Blues blooded seven debutants, the best of whom looks to be key defender Harry O\u2019Farrell, who, unfortunately, injured his knee. Other gains were bitter-sweet. Jack Silvagni was a revelation in defence but played just 13 games and is now on the move. Ollie Hollands found plenty of the ball in his new role as a running defender but his kicking needs work. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Mitch McGovern. The Blues are keen to get money off their books and the writing is on the wall for the 30-year-old, who narrowly missed a games trigger that would have earned a contract extension. With Silvagni walking out and O\u2019Farrell to be unsighted for much of 2026, the defender may yet get another year, but it will be on the Blues\u2019 terms. Veterans Adam Saad and Blake Acres both had ordinary seasons.\n\nSomething to look forward to: With mass change underway in the coaches box, free agents Tom De Koning and Silvagni confirming their departures, and ongoing chatter about Charlie Curnow, it\u2019s already been a turbulent off-season for the Blues, and the AFL home and away season isn\u2019t even officially over yet! Expect that turmoil to continue for some time yet. But once they ride that out, there will be hope again. The departures of De Koning and Silvagni will strengthen the Blues\u2019 draft hand to acquire highly-rated Harry Dean as a father-son pick. Decimated by injury in 2025, the Blues can vault back into finals contention with a cleaner bill of health. Curnow (assuming he stays) and Sam Walsh had interrupted preseasons which severely impacted their year. Harry McKay missed half the season. Matthew Cottrell and Elijah Hollands, two of their best runners, hardly played, and heart-and-soul defender Nic Newman didn\u2019t get on the field at all.\n\nThen there\u2019s the prospect of a fit Jagga Smith. Get all them right and the Blues should be stronger \u2013 but this was a year when they fell well below expectations. Best and fairest tip: George Hewett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu Melbourne (14th) Wins: 7. Losses: 16. Draft picks: 23, 51, 59*\n\nWhat went well: Kysaiah Pickett graduated from a star goalsneak to a game-breaking midfielder/forward who now rivals skipper Max Gawn as the club\u2019s best player. Despite their troubles, the Demons secured Pickett\u2019s prized signature in a huge coup, keeping him in the red and the blue until the end of 2034 on a lucrative contract. Midfielders Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver are stars for Melbourne and both have long-term contracts, but that no longer means their respective futures at the club are guaranteed. Credit: Getty Images Gawn was again a colossus, talking through action on the field and becoming their spokesperson for almost every crisis off it. Rebounding defender Jake Bowey has taken the next step to become a driver of the team while Harvey Langford, the No.6 pick in last year\u2019s draft, is the Demons\u2019 next A-grade midfielder after making a seamless transition to senior football.\n\nVeteran forward Jake Melksham, with 33 goals from 18 games, earned himself another contract, which was confirmed by the Demons just days after their season ended. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Clayton Oliver and Christian Petracca. Do two of Melbourne\u2019s greatest players want to stay? If either player wants out, the club should not stand in their way. Coming back from a life-threatening injury, Petracca\u2019s season was steady, and he will likely finish in the top six of the club\u2019s best and fairest award, but a long way from his game-breaking ways.\n\nLoading Oliver was better than last year when his campaign was compromised by his off-field issues. Both still have time to return to their best but the competition trend away from contest and stoppage towards speed and ball use is against them. Jacob van Rooyen went backwards in a season the club needed him to hold down a key forward posting. Something to look forward to: The appointment of a new coach always renews hope among the supporter base. Nathan Buckley is the early favourite but whoever succeeds Simon Goodwin must decide whether the core of this list can rise again after two years of diminishing returns or if it\u2019s time to invest more heavily in the next generation.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size He was born into a storied Australian family famed for its entrepreneurialism \u2013 and for fierce intrafamilial fighting. A legal feud over the multimillion-dollar estate of a member of the Hordern retailing dynasty is playing out in the Supreme Court in Sydney, decades after the last of the family\u2019s shops were shuttered in NSW. The case is one of a rising number of disputes over inheritances, and it highlights some of the common threads in wills and estates litigation. Hordern, shown here at the laying of the foundation stone for Town Hall House, served on the City of Sydney council from 1969 to 1974. Credit: Fairfax Media Samuel Carr Hordern, a former stockbroker and City of Sydney alderman \u2013 a councillor, in the modern parlance \u2013 died in 2023, aged 94. Under a will dated June 2017, he left the bulk of his estate, worth at least $10 million, to his second wife. He left his four children, including two stepchildren, $250,000 each. His daughter Dinah launched proceedings last year against her stepmother in a bid to secure a greater share of the estate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDinah informed me that she seeks an order for provision from the estate for approximately $7 million,\u201d Justice Francois Kunc said in a preliminary decision in May. Those proceedings are at an early stage, and orders made by the court last month suggest Dinah may re-work her claim and launch fresh proceedings to challenge the validity of the will. Meanwhile, Hordern\u2019s son Matthew has launched a separate case. Latest in Hordern family disputes The cases are the latest in a series of Hordern disputes. Historically, separate family businesses competed against each other in Sydney. Samuel Carr Hordern\u2019s great-great-grandparents, English migrants Anthony and Ann Hordern, arrived in Sydney in the 1820s. Ann\u2019s drapery business in Pitt and later King Street was the beginning of the retail empire. The former Anthony Hordern and Sons building on the site of what is now World Square. This was run by a separate arm of the Hordern dynasty to Samuel Carr Hordern\u2019s side of the family. Credit: Alan Gilbert Purcell/Fairfax Media Their son Anthony II laid the groundwork for what became the sprawling Sydney department store Anthony Hordern & Sons, occupying the site of what is now World Square.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades this was a separate business to Hordern Brothers in Pitt Street, around what is now the MidCity shopping centre. Hordern Brothers was run by Samuel Carr Hordern\u2019s side of the family. Cutting the inheritance pie Dinah Hordern\u2019s claim started as an application for a family provision order. This is a way for those closest to a deceased, including current or former dependants, to seek a larger slice of the inheritance pie if inadequate provision was made for them in a will. The number of family provision cases filed in the NSW Supreme Court has increased over the past 20 years, from 655 in 2005 to 996 last year. But the claims are not a modern phenomenon. \u201c[It] had its origins in the Roman Empire,\u201d said HWL Ebsworth partner Guy Moloney, an expert in wills and estates litigation. \u201cThey had laws like this in Rome, and then they were revived, first in New Zealand ... in the late 19th century, and then Victoria, and soon every state and territory in Australia [followed].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoloney said the policy objective was to ensure that if a deceased estate had resources to support a person in need who had a moral claim to a share of it, provision was made for them to \u201cease the burden\u201d on state resources. It was \u201csocial legislation\u201d focused on need, not fairness, he said. \u201cThe fact that it can override a person\u2019s will is what creates consternation,\u201d Moloney said. But he believed the laws generally achieved their objective. Speaking hypothetically, Moloney said an estranged child who had been troublesome to a parent and had been cut out of their will might, \u201cperversely, be the person who is in the greatest need\u201d when their parent died. He said part of his job was to advise clients drafting a will that \u201cif you give this problem child nothing, that might incite a claim\u201d for a family provision order. \u201cThe wise advice \u2026 might be to leave them something, if they can, [as] a deterrent amount,\u201d Moloney said. Turnbull Hill Lawyers partner Adrian Corbould, a specialist in wills and estates law, said family provision claims were \u201cnot a free-for-all\u201d. The categories of people who are eligible to seek a family provision order are relatively confined, such as a current or former spouse, de facto partners and children. The court must be satisfied adequate provision hasn\u2019t been made for them on a needs basis. Grandchildren or others who lived with the deceased may be eligible if they can demonstrate they were \u201cwholly or partly dependent\u201d on them at some point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA person who is neither a spouse nor partner but is living with the deceased in a close personal relationship, sharing a household and providing care, is also eligible. But eligibility is just the first hurdle before an order can be made. Corbould said the categories of eligible people reflected the \u201cinnate public feeling that you should, where circumstances warrant and permit, provide for your spouse and children [and other dependants] on your death\u201d. Lovers of a married deceased may emerge to seek a share. In a current case, a former football boss who lived what a NSW judge described as a \u201ccolourful but \u2018hard living\u2019 life\u201d made a will shortly before his death leaving his entire million-dollar estate to his wife of 28 years. His lover in Greece wants the court to make an order giving her a slice of the estate. The experts made clear the cases were about need. A financially secure person would have difficulty persuading a court they needed a family provision order. \u201cYou have to prove \u2018why do I need it\u2019, not \u2018why do I want it\u2019,\u201d Corbould said. \u201cThey\u2019re the kinds of claims that settle for low tens of thousands, just to make them go away.\u201d Corbould noted the vast majority of wills were not contested, meaning a person was free to divide their assets as they wished and there was a \u201cvery, very good chance\u201d it would not be challenged.

    "text": "That\u2019s a tough gig for anyone, let alone a 29-year-old professional footballer who is paid to perform on the field. Particularly when as, AFLPA president, he is also obliged to be conscious of a player\u2019s well-being and entitlement to a fair process when they overstep the mark as Rankine did. The stage is set for another showdown between the Crows and Magpies. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than one issue. It\u2019s bigger than the two players [who] are involved in that incident. It really is a league-wide topic so it is one I have addressed with my AFLPA president hat on,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI feel a profound sense of responsibility to be in this position, to navigate these conversations and to stand up for what is right and what\u2019s wrong. As an industry, we have an enormous place in Australian cultural life and so part of that is about the impact that we have on the community.\u201d\n\nThe week after the Rankine incident, Moore made a short public statement on the Players\u2019 Association\u2019s social media channels applauding former West Coast player Mitch Brown for his \u201ccourage and candour\u201d in coming out at as bisexual. Again, Moore struck the right tone. \u201cStories like his have so much to teach us an industry if we are willing to learn,\u201d he said. On Thursday night he takes the AFLPA hat off and puts on a headband to assume another huge responsibility. Moore will lead a shaky Collingwood back to the scene of Rankine\u2019s outburst as they attempt to overcome a hostile crowd, a quality set of Crows\u2019 forwards, Taylor Walker\u2019s 300th game, and an average, at best, form line to reach the preliminary final. The three-point defeat to the Crows in round 23 was one of five losses Collingwood endured in their final seven matches of the home-and-away season. They clung to fourth spot when they beat Melbourne by a goal and Port Adelaide upset the Suns in Power\u2019s final match for the season.\n\nRather than letting the wonky form deplete their confidence, Moore says the lessons learned in the previous two months has given his team renewed optimism about their chances in September. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really galvanised as a leadership group. We\u2019re an experienced team so we know the answers, and we know that we\u2019re capable,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if. It\u2019s a question of how for us.\u201d Moore was Collingwood\u2019s best finals player in 2022 Credit: AAPIMAGE That question is more challenging to answer without Jeremy Howe and Bobby Hill. Tougher than the 14-peaks challenge they met after 16 matches when they won their 14th match of the season against Carlton in round 17, and reset their goals. Since then, Moore\u2019s form has been questioned. So has Collingwood\u2019s ability to score. And whether the Magpies\u2019 ageing list will last the distance.\n\nLoading Moore hits back at any criticism with a verbal spoil that spikes the question about their defence over the fence and three rows back. \u201cWe\u2019re the number one team for scores against in the league. That is really the ultimate test of the defence. For me as a leader and a key part of our defence, that\u2019s a massive one,\u201d Moore said. Of course numbers can tell all sorts of stories with the Magpies conceding 70.73 points per game over 23 rounds, 77.42 points per game in the final seven matches and 67.50 points per game in the final two rounds. The question about Moore\u2019s own form is met with the sort of defensive qualities likely to be on display when he joins his teammates in tackling the triple towers of Taylor Walker, Riley Thilthorpe and Darcy Fogarty.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re defending as a team and it has a system, so it\u2019s not on one person. That\u2019s certainly been the key for me in my game is to find that balance between when to impact and when to play system defence,\u201d Moore said. Back we go: The Magpies will head to Adelaide for week one of the finals. Credit: Getty Images So the Magpies are capable defensively. Their biggest issue is converting inside 50s into goals, something they have worked on in the past month, having only broken 80 points twice in their past seven matches. Moore is switched on to what lies ahead. He is part of a club that has travelled to Adelaide as underdogs for three finals and won each time. He knows he has experienced players all around him who have proved their capacity to perform when it matters. And if the wary intensity he provides to conversation translates on the field, the Crows are in for a fight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got incredible experience [and] we\u2019ve got great trust in what we\u2019ve been able to do as a core group that have played together for a long time,\u201d Moore said.",

That duality of the seen and unseen selves is explored in the Harlem-born artist\u2019s upcoming show, Skin Tight, which opens at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art this month. Curated by ACCA\u2019s Dr Shelley McSpedden and CEO and artistic director Myles Russell-Cook, the show features 30 artworks, and is designed as an immersive experience. While this is Self\u2019s first Australian show, she is a big name internationally, collected by the Guggenheim, the Whitney, the Met and the Studio Museum in Harlem; her work has achieved six-figure prices at auction. Her bold, confident creations are designed to challenge preconceptions; at the same time they are often playful, teasing and sensual. Because of the size of her paintings, she often works on the floor, wearing knee pads, and the layering effect achieved through the use of textiles \u2013 and other found materials \u2013 reflects the complexity of the issues she addresses. Self leaves it to the viewer to determine a work\u2019s meaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpedden saw Self\u2019s work at London\u2019s Barbican gallery as part of Unravel: the power and politics of textiles in art, which featured 50 artists who \u201cuse textiles to communicate vital ideas about power, resistance and survival\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s a rock star in the international art world but there\u2019s a lack of knowledge [about her] locally,\u201d McSpedden says. \u201cThis [show] is going to blow your mind.\u201d Tschabalala Self, Candy, 2021. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Pilar Corrias Gallery, London As well as the paintings \u2013 which McSpedden describes as fabric assemblages\u2013 there is a soft sculpture, which depicts two figures embracing, made from fabric. \u201cThe painting style I\u2019ve developed emerged from my print-making practice,\u201d says Self. \u201cI used to do collagraphs, with plates made from non-conventional materials: cardboard, bits of fabric, various materials that create enough of a surface to produce a transfer.\u201d At one stage, she cut up old oil paintings to make prints: \u201cthey had enough peaks and valleys that they could be inked up\u201d. At ACCA, there\u2019s also a three-channel video, a reimagining of a play Self wrote, directed and created sets and costumes for in 2021. \u201cI like to repurpose materials in my practice, so I revisited the documentation of the play and turned it into a non-linear, three channel video,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the new works in the ACCA show are huge. The immersive nature of the show relates to how it is hung: murals created by VCA students, under Self\u2019s direction, will adorn each room, \u201ccreating a psychological space\u201d says McSpedden. Tschabalala Self, Blue Woman, 2025. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Pilar Corrias Gallery, London Making art helps Self articulate the big issues but does it help resolve them? \u201cMaking art is a way of investigating the questions I have; I don\u2019t really know if it helps me resolve these questions. Maybe it does, but then I think there are always more questions that come about in life. What making art does for me and also viewing other people\u2019s art, it gives me the confidence to feel comfortable with the questions. \u201cI think a lot of the dread comes from feeling uncomfortable with having questions. You should feel comfortable to ask the question without the possibility of finding the answer \u2013 a lot of times people have a lot of dread because they can\u2019t fully articulate these questions and it just becomes an impending feeling of doom. \u201cIf they could just allow themselves to have questions, to let the questions linger, unanswered, have faith, give themselves the space to be with them \u2026 I think that\u2019s a healthier way to navigate life. I think the arts allow people that room, that space, that confidence; it allows me to have those experiences and I hope my art does the same for other people.\u201d The show\u2019s title is a double entendre, Self says. \u201cThe words \u2018skin tight\u2019 make you think about a body, curvaceous bodies, automatically you think about the silhouette that exists in my work, and for me that silhouette is important because it represents the pinnacle of the black female beauty standard. That\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind \u2013 the skin tight refers to the reality of identity politics but also the limitations of it.\u201d Tschabalala Self, Submission, 2025. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Pilar Corrias Gallery, London\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe all navigate the world as who we are. I\u2019m a black woman and there are certain expectations and stereotypes, negative and positive, that are attached to that, that people have of me. That\u2019s one of the ways people have to navigate the world, because of their skin. \u201cBut that also barely encompasses the totality, there are aspects to all people which supersede the way in which they show up in the world. And that brings up the existential concerns, this potential for a consciousness, a shared humanity and a spirit that is so much more complex than one\u2019s identity politics.\u201d Loading Self\u2019s parents moved from New Orleans to Harlem, where she and her four siblings grew up. Harlem in the 1990s was a beautiful, amazing place, she says, and for black Americans is a such a place of culture and history and pride. Her Bodega Run series, created in 2017, was inspired by the diversity of people there, as well as taking cues from labels of products on sale on the shelves at her local family-run store, the bodega. \u201cI was thinking about the different racial dynamics between people from African descent from different nations, and how their views on one another and themselves collided every day in the space at the corner store. \u201cIt is something I do like to explore in general within my work, thinking about all the different nuances of black identity and how understandings of blackness do shift, depending on where you are and the context,\u201d Self says. \u201cThe conversation is more complex than just looking at the concept of a black identity and a white identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Beetaloo Energy picked up its pace markedly in May after its development activities were delayed three months by heavy wet-season rains. To get the ball rolling, a $35 million jumbo placement was put away at 16 cents a share before the company fired the starter\u2019s gun to open up its massive horizontal Carpentaria-5H well.\n\nStimulation of the hole roared to life in mid-June. Oilfield heavyweight Halliburton rolled in with a monster 42,000 horsepower spread to punch more than 60 fracture stages into a 3.3-kilometre section of the Velkerri B Shale, making it the biggest fracture attempted in the Beetaloo sub-basin.\n\nBy early July, the program was hailed a resounding success, with Halliburton driving 67 slickwater fracks into the rock at breakneck pace.\n\nWater and sand were pumped underground at more than 100 barrels a minute, cracking open up to five stages a day. In total, a staggering 11,000 tonnes of sand was rammed into the shale - about 337,000 pounds per stage - to keep the fractures wedged wide open.\n\nBeetaloo Energy says the well has now been cleaned out and allowed to soak for a month before the all-important flow testing gets underway. The tests are due to start any day now.\n\nThey will run for 30 days with results expected by late September. A strong performance from C-5H would go a long way towards proving up the basin\u2019s commercial potential, setting the scene for pilot production.\n\nBeetaloo Energy has even more reason to be upbeat right now, after neighbour Tamboran Resources revealed a standout result from its Shenandoah South 2H sidetrack well.\n\nTamboran\u2019s 1671m horizontal well was drilled into the same Velkerri B shale and pumped out an impressive initial rate of 6.8 million cubic feet of gas a day over its first 60 days, easing only slightly to 6.4MMcf/d. In a dramatic twist, production ticked up to 6.5MMcf/d between days 60 and 90 \u2013 without a single downhole tweak and even as wellhead pressure eased.\n\nIn late June, Beetaloo Energy also secured another vital piece of the puzzle when the area\u2019s traditional owners, the Mambaliya Rrumburriya Wuyaliya Aboriginal Land Trust, formally consented to the sale of appraisal gas at an on-country meeting convened by the Northern Land Council.\n\nIf the flow test stacks up, this crucial consent will then unlock the territory government\u2019s vital beneficial use of gas approval \u2013 the green light needed for a final investment decision. That decision in turn will trigger $30 million in Macquarie Bank infrastructure funding to build the pilot plant, setting Beetaloo on course for first shale gas production in the second quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has locked in a weighty $65 million funding package, with $30 million earmarked for a research and development facility to supercharge its next growth phase. The cash injection will bankroll exploration, appraisal and development drilling \u2013 including the high-impact Carpentaria-5H well, while also covering the build-out of vital infield infrastructure to keep the project\u2019s momentum rolling.\n\nOf course, nothing is certain in the notoriously fickle oil and gas game. But should C-5H prove up commercial rates, it could spark a rush of interest from the majors \u2013 particularly United States shale veterans eyeing a basin some believe could host as much as 500 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n\nFor punters, the coming months promise to be pivotal. If the flow rates meet expectations, the company could lock in its place as the Northern Territory\u2019s first onshore shale gas producer \u2013 putting it firmly in the national energy spotlight.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

As a result, the S&P 500 slipped 0.7 per cent, the Dow Jones lost 0.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.8 per cent.\n\nLonger-term bond yields are on the rise around the world, in part because of worries about how difficult it will be for governments to repay their growing mountains of debt.",

    "text": "South Korean intelligence officials believe that Kim most likely has two children. There have also been unconfirmed reports that he might have a third child, possibly a son older than Ju-ae. But Ju-ae is the only child who has made public appearances. If she is her father\u2019s designated successor, she would be in line to become the first woman to rule North Korea\u2019s deeply patriarchal and highly militarised society and the world\u2019s newest nuclear power. Kim is only 41, but with a family history of heart trouble, preparing a successor makes sense. Here is a look at Ju-ae\u2019s rise. Taking the Stage Ju-ae has undergone a striking transformation in the country\u2019s tightly choreographed state media. Intelligence officials and analysts in South Korea caution against firm conclusions about her future role. But as her profile has risen, she has eclipsed her mother and Kim\u2019s powerful sister Kim Yo-jong, also once considered a potential successor, as the main female face of the ruling family.\n\nLoading A New Look Ju-ae\u2019s birth and name were first revealed to the outside world by retired NBA star Dennis Rodman, who met the Kim family during a visit to North Korea in 2013. When she made her first public appearance in 2022 in a white padded winter jacket, Ju-ae looked no different from the other children of the elites in Pyongyang. But as she has grown, her clothes have become more formal, and she has been transformed into a figure of authority. Her wardrobe now includes tailored leather coats with fur collars and two-piece designer suits. As her mother has receded from public view, Ju-ae has begun to adopt her sense of fashion.\n\nHer mannerisms and demeanour have also changed. Even something as small as how she claps looks different now than it did two years ago. \u201cThe child who first appeared as a family curiosity is now a polished, rehearsed figure woven into North Korea\u2019s ongoing story of dynastic power,\u201d said Donald Southerton, the author of Korea 101. \u201cEach photo, parade walk and salute I see as a carefully staged story of succession, legitimacy and continuity for the Kim dynasty.\u201d Should a brother emerge, Ju-ae may end up serving as a mere placeholder, said Kang Dong-wan, an expert on North Korea at Dong-A University in South Korea. For now, though, her prominent portrayal is sending a message to North Koreans that the Kim family rule will continue into a fourth generation. This photo was provided by the North Korean government and shows Kim Jong-un, centre, with his daughter, Kim Ju-ae, reviewing the honour guard during their visit to naval headquarters in 2023. Credit: AP Her Main Inheritance\n\nKim chose the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, for his daughter\u2019s public debut in November 2022. Since that day, he has taken her to other nuclear-related sites, introducing her to officials involved in North Korea\u2019s weapons programs. He has lauded the arsenal as a major legacy of the family\u2019s rule. When Kim himself was being groomed to succeed his father, he first established his authority with the military, the key to maintaining power. Now, by taking Ju-ae to military events, Kim has been showing her how he handles the top brass. He has also offered senior military officers opportunities to meet and show loyalty to her, analysts said. Three months after her first appearance, she attended a military parade, walking with her parents and followed by the top brass. And this year, she attended the launch of the Kang Kon, one of the North Korean navy\u2019s new destroyers, standing near her father and top officials.\n\nKim\u2019s health By preparing a successor publicly from an early age, Kim may be trying to avoid the mistake his father made, analysts say. It was not until after his father had a stroke in 2008 that Kim was unveiled as the heir apparent. That led to uncertainty about the younger Kim. In his early years, he faced scepticism from outside analysts who dismissed him as an inexperienced leader and argued that he would not last long. In this photo provided by the North Korean government, Kim Jong-un, his wife, Ri Sol-ju, right, and his daughter, Kim Ju-ae, attend a feast to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding Korean People\u2019s Army in 2023. Credit: AP That was before Kim executed his uncle, had his half-brother assassinated by his agents in Malaysia and purged several top generals to establish his unchallenged authority.\n\nNow it is primarily Kim\u2019s health, not his hold on power, that is in question. He is about 1.7m tall and weighs about 140kg, according to South Korean intelligence officials. They added that he had unhealthy habits, including chain-smoking, heavy wining and dining, and frequently staying up into the early morning to surf the internet, where he likes to browse weapons sites. Loading Kim is believed to have cardiovascular issues, which contributed to the deaths of his father and grandfather. One advantage to grooming a successor early, even a young child, is leverage against his American and South Korean adversaries, said Sung-Yoon Lee, the author of The Sister: North Korea\u2019s Kim Yo-jong, the Most Dangerous Woman in the World. \u201cIt tells them, \u2018We have all the time in the world, while you are bound by term limits of four to five years,\u2019\u201d Lee said.",

Picture: NewsWire / Nikki Short\n\nAXED\n\nMs Lattouf sued the ABC in the Federal Court after she was sent home for the final two days of a stint on ABC Radio\u2019s Sydney Mornings program in the lead-up to Christmas in 2023.\n\nMs Lattouf was called up as a fill-in host for five shifts starting on Monday, December 18 but was told not to come in for the final two shows.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe had argued she was unlawfully dismissed after sharing a post on social media by Human Rights Watch reading: \u201cHRW reporting starvation as a tool of war. The Israeli government is using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war in Gaza.\u201d\n\nShe said that she was sacked after sharing the post and as a result of a flurry of emails from pro-Israel supporters to ABC management.\n\nThe ABC had argued Ms Lattouf\u2019s employment was not terminated when she was told that she was not required to appear on air for the rest of the week.\n\nHowever, that argument was rejected by the court.\n\nJustice Rangiah found that when Ms Lattouf was told she was not required for her final two shifts, it was a \u201ceuphemistic way\u201d of telling her that she was being taken off air.\n\nThe court was told the decision to axe Ms Lattouf came after the ABC received a host of complaints about her pro-Palestinian politics over the preceding days.",
