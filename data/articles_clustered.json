(MoleQL/iStock)\n\nThey found that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used to treat indigestion and heartburn were associated with poorer overall survival for breast cancer patients, and a 36 per cent higher risk of severe, treatment-associated side effects\ufeff.\n\nResearchers believe PPIs could interfere with the body's immune responses, or change how the body reacts to cancer drugs, though they note further investigation is needed.\n\nThe study, published in Cancer Medicine, also found that drugs commonly prescribed for heart disease or hypertension, such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium-channel blockers, were linked to higher rates of severe side-effects from breast cancer treatment - but did not appear to affect overall survival rates.\ufeff\n\nDrugs such as statins and metformin, used to manage high cholesterol and diabetes respectively, showed no significant impacts on either survival or side effects.\n\nMedicines used to treat high blood pressure could be dangerous for breast cancer patients. (Getty)\n\nThe data was based on 19 major clinical trials involving 23,000 people, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies including Lilly, Pfizer and Roche, and is believed to be the largest and most comprehensive analysis of its kind in the world.\n\nLead author Dr Natansh Modi, from UniSA and Flinders University, said the findings revealed a complex relationship between commonly prescribed medications and cancer outcomes.\n\n\"Many women with breast cancer are also managing other chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes or acid reflux, meaning they are often taking multiple drugs at once,\" Modi said.\n\nREAD MORE: Musk on the cusp of being first ever trillionaire\n\n\"Our results don't suggest that people should stop taking their non-cancer medicines, but it underlines how important it is for doctors to regularly review patient medications because people are living longer and managing multiple health issues.\"\n\nCorresponding senior author, Flinders University Associate Professor Ashley Hopkins, said the findings show that patients taking PPIs in cancer treatment settings warranted closer attention in particular.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that patients should cease their reflux medication without medical advice, but clinicians should be alert to potential risks and review whether PPIs are genuinely needed,\" he said.\n\nIt's estimated over 20,000 people will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2025. (Getty)\n\nThe researchers said the study highlighted the need for a more holistic approach to breast cancer management that considered all medications a patient was taking.\n\nThe authors have also called for follow-up studies to explore the biological reasons behind the observed drug interactions and to develop clinical guidelines for the safe co-prescription of these medicines during cancer therapy.\n\nThis year, the government estimates more than 20,000 people will be diagnosed with breast cancer, of which 3353 are predicted to die.\ufeff",

(AP)\n\nMusk thanked the shareholders and the Tesla board soon after the vote was announced.\n\n\"I super appreciate it,\" he said.\n\nMusk doesn't take any salary, but the approved pay package comes in the form of a stock grant that would give him as much as 423.7 million additional Tesla shares over the next ten years.\n\nThose shares could be worth about $1.54 trillion, assuming the company reaches the $13 trillion market cap needed to have Musk qualify for the full potential payout.\n\nIn addition, Tesla needs to achieve a series of either operational or financial targets for him to get the full number of shares, which would be distributed in 12 equal blocks.\n\nGetting all the shares available under this package over the next ten years would be the equivalent of earning $423.5 million a day, dwarfing any other executive pay package in history.\n\nDemonstrators in Austin protest Elon Musk's pay deal. (AP)\n\nFor Tesla to reach the $13.09 trillion in market value needed, shares need to jump 466 per cent from today's stock price.\n\nThat's also about 70 per cent higher than the world's most valuable company, Nvidia, which hit a record $7.7 trillion market cap last week.\n\nMusk is already worth an estimated $728 billion according to Bloomberg's billionaire tracker, most due to his holdings in Tesla, as well as the other companies he controls, including SpaceX and xAI.\n\nA no vote today could have meant his exit from Tesla's CEO office.\n\nTesla's board said in a filing that Musk had raised the possibility of leaving the company if he didn't get the assurances of control that the pay package could grant him.\n\nHowever, the company has had a rocky year.\n\nTesla has lost popularity after Elon Musk embraced Donald Trump and far-right values. (CNN)\n\nSales and profits plunged in the first half and Tesla faces potential billions in lost revenue due to reduced US government support for electric vehicles.\n\nBut Musk and Tesla executives dismiss those problems, saying Tesla is shifting focus from merely selling EVs to selling self-driving cars, including a fleet of \"robotaxis,\" as well as humanoid robots.\n\nThose products and concepts are still under development and haven't gone on sale.\n\nThat means even with the passage of the pay package, it's not certain that Musk will ever see any of its potential hundreds of millions of shares.\n\nHe will need to straighten out the company's current problems and then live up to the big promises that he's made for the future.\n\nMusk said the robots will be bigger than the company's car business - or any other business, even.\n\n\"I think it's going to be the biggest product of all time by far,\" he said.\n\n\"So like bigger than cell phones, bigger than anything.\n\n\"I guess a way to think about it is that every human on Earth is going to want to have their own personal R2D2 or C3PO.\"\n\nHe even predicted Tesla's robots could replace surgeons, lead to the end of global poverty and re-shape the global economic order.\n\nHe claims they could be produced for $30,000 each, allowing the company to sell them for about the price of a car.\n\nMusk has insisted he needs the additional shares to have more control over the company, not because he wants so much more wealth.\n\n\"It's not like I'm going to go spend the money,\" Musk said on a call with investors last month.\n\n\"There needs to be enough voting control to give (me) a strong influence \u2013 but not so much that I can't be fired if I go insane.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Why thousands of Australians are buying and selling snack vending machines",

    "text": "$100,000 could be slashed from the price of properties and rents also made significantly more affordable under an ambitious plan to drastically increase the number of homes built in Australia .\n\nThe proposal, put forward by independent think tank the Grattan Institute, calls on governments to allow three-storey townhouses to be built on residential land in capital cities without the need for planning permits.\n\nIt also says the same exception should apply to apartment blocks of up to six storeys near public transport hubs and \"key commercial centres\".\n\nHousing in Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's south-west. (Justin McManus)\n\nAuthors Brendan Coates, Joey Moloney and Matthew Bowes argued the changes \u2013 along with nine other recommendations put forward in the report \u2013 would help alleviate many of the issues that have caused Australia's housing crisis.\n\n\"Housing in Australia's major cities is among the least affordable in the world,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Restrictive planning controls add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cost of new housing in our capital cities.\n\n\"For decades, Australia has failed to build enough homes in the places that people most want to live.\n\n\"Now we have a housing affordability crisis that is dividing families and communities and robbing young Australians of their best chance in life.\"\n\nThe authors said the plan would speed up construction projects. (Louie Douvis)\n\nBy providing default approval for those townhouses and apartments, new construction projects would be able to avoid time-consuming council and other government processes that the authors argue overwhelmingly favour a lack of development.\n\n\"The key problem is that state and territory land-use planning systems say 'no' to new housing by default, and 'yes' only by exception,\" they wrote.\n\nIt would also help Australian cities significantly increase their levels of population density, which currently lag well behind those seen overseas.\n\nREAD MORE: Microsoft apologises to millions of Australians\n\n\ufeff The report says the proposed changes would lead to 67,000 homes being built a year, which would, in turn, cut rents by 12 per cent and reduce median prices by $100,000 over a decade.\n\nThe authors also argue the proposal could reduce Australian greenhouse gas emissions by providing more people with shorter commutes and would boost the national economy by up to $25 billion a year in the long term.\n\n\"Building more homes where people most want to live will make housing cheaper and create wealthier, healthier, and more vibrant cities,\" the report states.\n\nThe recommendations come just days after new research from Cotality found the cost of a median Australian home hit a new record high of $872,538, driven by the fastest price rise in more than two years \u2013 despite interest rates remaining somewhat restrictive at 3.6 per cent since August.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese during a visit to Pacific Link Housing in the NSW electorate of Robertson during the 2025 federal election campaign. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nThe Reserve Bank and other experts have consistently warned the housing crisis has been driven by a lack of supply.\n\nRBA Governor Michele Bullock has cautioned that, even though governments are starting to make promising moves to address the lack of construction, it is likely to be at least two years before property starts to get more affordable for Australians .\n\nWhile the federal government set a target of building 1.2 million new homes between last July and June 2029, it is already lagging well behind and faces little prospect of actually hitting that goal.\n\nThe Grattan report argues part of the problem is the $3.5 billion in incentives from the Commonwealth to the states for building more homes are poorly structured.\n\nThe authors said the federal government should pay those incentives in periodic instalments rather than a lump sum at the end of the five-year period, and that it should also pay the states to reform planning controls.",

(Reuters: Ryan Murphy)\n\nThe Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) this week said it planned to reduce national air traffic in the US by 10 per cent in \"high-volume\" markets from 6am Eastern Time on Friday (9pm Friday AEST) to maintain travel safety.\n\nThe Trump administration's Transportation Department later released a separate statement saying it only planned to cut flight numbers by 4 per cent, rising to 5 per cent on Saturday, 6 per cent on Sunday and up to 10 per cent by next week, Reuters reported.\n\nSo, what does that mean for the tens of thousands of domestic flights set to be cancelled, their passengers and the viability of air travel in the US in the immediate future? Here's what we know.\n\nFirstly, why did the US government shut down?\n\nThe US government has been subject to a political pause for 37 days, sparked on October 1 by furious Democrats, who are demanding President Donald Trump begin serious negotiations amid a stalemate over expiring healthcare subsidies.\n\nThe US government shutdown in numbers The ongoing federal government shutdown has surpassed the record for the longest in US history, leaving thousands of workers without pay. Here are some of the key numbers.\n\nThe shutdown has led to mass closures of federal agencies, left thousands of workers without pay and millions more without money to buy food.\n\nThe FAA has been slowing or temporarily halting air traffic at certain airports across the US whenever a safety concern arises due to a shortage of tarmac controllers, at times leading to hours-long travel delays.\n\nWhile some air traffic controllers are expected to continue working through the planned reductions, there have been instances of staff absences at airports across the country that have also led to flight disruptions.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy has predicted that an ongoing shutdown could result in travel chaos, and said financial pressures on 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents working without pay would only continue to intensify.\n\n\"If you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\n\" You will see mass flight delays. You'll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don't have air traffic controllers. \"\n\nWhich airports will be impacted by flight cuts?\n\nBryan Bedford, the administrator of the FAA, said this week that reductions to domestic flights would be implemented to maintain air safety during a traditionally busy part of the year for travellers.\n\nThe Airlines for America trade group last year projected more than 31 million passengers planned to fly on US carriers over the November Thanksgiving holiday period, in a record increase from the year before.\n\nFlight reductions are being implemented due to staff shortages in air traffic control centres operating at major airports. (AP: Seth Wenig)\n\n\"When we see pressures building in these 40 markets, we just can't ignore it,\" Mr Bedford told a press conference.\n\n\"If the pressures continue to build even after we take these measures, we'll come back and take additional measures.\"\n\nA list of impacted airports was released by the FAA on Thursday, local time. The Associated Press reported that impacted major travel hubs included airports in Virginia, Texas, New York, California and Florida.\n\nEarlier in the week, aviation analytics firm Cirium predicted flight reductions in 30 of the US's busiest airports would result in as many as 1,800 commercial flights and more than 268,000 airline seats being impacted.\n\nAt least 760 flights scheduled for Friday were already cancelled by late on Thursday, according to the Flight Aware website \u2014 which equated to more than four times the number of cancellations the day before.\n\nAmerican Airlines, the US's largest commercial carrier, said in a statement on Wednesday that it expected the \"vast majority\" of its customers to be unaffected by the reductions but also cut about 220 flights.\n\n\"As schedule changes are made, we will proactively reach out to customers who are impacted. As always, we encourage all customers to check their flight status on aa.com or the mobile app,\" the statement said.\n\nSouthwest, the country's largest low-cost domestic carrier, said it was evaluating how the reductions would affect its schedule but confirmed cuts to about 120 services, while the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 55,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, called the shutdown \"cruel attacks on all Americans\".\n\nUnited Airlines would cut 4 per cent of its flights over the weekend based on guidance from the FAA, company spokesperson Josh Freed said. Delta Airlines said it would cancel up to 170 flights scheduled for Friday.\n\nThe FAA directs more than 44,000 flights daily, including commercial passenger flights, cargo planes and private aircraft.\n\nAirlines can face a $US75,000 ($115,000) fine for each flight operated over the limit, the FAA said. The agency also threatened to impose cuts if carriers did not make cuts equitably across communities.\n\nThree of the country's busiest airports, located in New York City and New Jersey, are set to be impacted by the reductions. (AP: Seth Wenig)\n\nUS-based airlines are used to dealing with cutting thousands of flights on short notice during severe weather, but the difference now is that these cuts during the shutdown will last indefinitely until safety data improves.\n\nWhat is the advice for travellers?\n\nThe Australian government's Smartraveller website says travellers should expect \"flight delays, longer queue times at a number of airports and increased processing times to issue US visas\" as a result of the shutdown.\n\n\"Check with your nearest US Embassy/Consulate or your travel provider to see if your travel plans have been affected,\" an advisory on the website says.\n\nAmerican Automobile Association spokesperson Aixa Diaz says some travellers in the US are already considering adjusting their plans and driving to destinations, but acknowledged that it was not an option for everyone.\n\nTravellers in the US are being advised to expect longer waits and to allow for more time at airports before scheduled flights. (AP: Matt Rourke)\n\nShe advised that people with booked trips tried to stay informed by downloading their airline's mobile app and monitoring it for updates to planned travel, checking airport websites for the latest information, and allowing for plenty of time at airports before a flight.\n\n\"It's frustrating for travellers because there's not much you can do. At the end of the day, you either fly or you don't,\" she said.\n\n\"You go on your trip and you roll the dice and you show up at the airport, or you choose to drive. So you don't have that many options.\"\n\nBarry Biffle, the head of low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines, also recommended travellers buy backup tickets with another airline to avoid being stranded.\n\nUnited, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have all said that they would offer refunds to passengers who opted not to fly, even if they purchased tickets that were not normally refundable.\n\nHow could Australian travellers be impacted?\n\nIt will depend on the flight they take, according to Flight Centre CEO Graham Turner.\n\n\"Generally, international flights will be protected, from what we believe,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"Assuming people are prepared for some disruption, the chances are that the international flights will be the last to be disrupted \u2014 that's the advice that we're giving to our customers in the States.\n\n\" If people can [fly] directly into their destination \u2014 whether it's LA or New York \u2014 the chances are that they should be OK out of Australia \u2026 If you have to have a domestic transfer, you may well have to wait a while. \"\n\nMr Turner also said Flight Centre would advise business customers, which made up most of the company's consumer base, to be aware that there would be fewer available seats during peak-hour services, longer delays at major airports and the chance of \"reduced redundancy\" \u2014 meaning a person's chances of booking onto another plane after a cancelled flight would be more difficult due to higher demand.\n\nWhat might happen next to travel in the US?\n\nMajor US airlines were this week still assessing how significantly the ongoing shutdown and reductions to flight numbers would impact their customers.\n\nAirlines for America, which represents major carriers such as Delta United, American and Southwest, said its members were trying to understand the next steps.\n\n\"We are working with the federal government to understand all details of the new reduction mandate and will strive to mitigate impacts to passengers and shippers,\" it said.\n\nSean Duffy says that the longer the federal government shutdown continues, the worse the impacts could grow on domestic flight operations. (AP: Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nAirlines have repeatedly urged an end to the shutdown since it began, and many major carriers have suffered significant dips in their share prices.\n\nSome airlines say the shutdown has not impacted their overall business, but have warned bookings could drop if the shutdown drags on.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Bedford said up to 40 per cent of air traffic controllers at the FAA's 30 largest airports were failing to show up for work. On Wednesday, that led to more than 2,100 flights nationwide experiencing delays.\n\nMr Duffy said the FAA wanted to take a proactive approach to solving the issue, instead of reacting after an aviation disaster, such as the deadly mid-air collision in January between a commercial jet and a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia.\n\n\"We learned from that, and so now we look at data and \u2014 before it would become an issue \u2014 we try to assess the pressure and try to make moves before there could be adverse consequences,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what's happening here today.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nABC/wires",

(ABC South East SA: Samuel O'Brien)\n\nCouncil environmental sustainability business partner Aaron Izzard said nearly 100 households had signed up for the first round of the program.\n\n\"Half of that is solar and battery systems and another 40 or so is just battery retrofits,\" Mr Izzard said.\n\n\" The number one motivator is electricity prices and reducing household costs. \"\n\nMr Izzard said he would like to see the partnership between the City of Mount Gambier and Shinehub replicated across regional South Australia.\n\n\"The whole reason for a bulk buy is so you can activate more of that economy of scale so you can get installers and the equipment down and do it all in one go,\" he said.\n\n\"I would encourage other councils to have a look at it.\"\n\nElisabeth Champion, who had her system installed about a month ago, said the installation had transformed the way her family used electricity at home.\n\nElisabeth Champion has taken up the scheme.

Every morning, I get up now and the heater is on.\n\n\"We wouldn't have done that previously; we'd turn the heater on when it's absolutely freezing.\"\n\nMs Champion decided to install a battery as well, allowing her to take advantage of the power her panels generated during the day.\n\nElisabeth Champion with her new battery. (ABC South East SA: Samuel O'Brien)\n\n\"[It] probably wouldn't have been worth it for us without the battery because it means that by 11 o'clock in the morning the battery is full and we can run the rest of the day just on the battery,\" she said.\n\n\"It just gives us a little bit more freedom to use power that we wouldn't have otherwise.\"\n\nBattery uptake accelerates\n\nAccording to the federal government's figures, household battery uptake is accelerating, with more than 50,000 batteries installed in homes across the country since the scheme was expanded.\n\nThe Royal Automobile Association of South Australia reported 65 per cent of solar systems it had installed in 2025 also included batteries, up from 29 per cent two years ago.\n\nSouth Australian households are taking up the Cheaper Home Batteries Program.

And you react differently,\" Canada's 1997 winner Villeneuve claimed, suggesting Piastri had not been the same driver since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when he crashed twice and jumped the start.\n\nBut as he prepared for the S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix on Thursday, Piastri dismissed the idea of a crisis of confidence.\n\nHow to follow Oscar Piastri during the F1 grand prix this weekend Oscar Piastri enters this weekend's Formula 1 racing, trailing his teammate by one point in the drivers' championship.

    "text": "After a five-year ban, the first shipment of Australian canola to China is expected to sail from a regional West Australian port this weekend.\n\nAnalysts say the 65,000-tonne trial shipment is a sign Australia's $4-billion canola export industry could reinstate trade with what was once one of its most valuable customers.\n\nAustralian canola was locked out of China in 2020 due to disease concerns, but a spat between China and the world's largest exporter of the product, Canada, could reopen the door for Australian farmers.\n\nAustralian exports of canola are expected to be worth more than $4 billion this season. (Supplied: Paul Goh)\n\nCBH Esperance Port zone general manager Paul Channon said the Armonia A docked on Wednesday and was expected to be loaded and to sail to Qingdao, in north-east China's Shandong province, on Saturday.\n\n\"We're lucky to be part of that shipment within our zone, and it's a welcome sight sitting out in the bay at the moment,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's Manual of Importing Country Requirements, Chinese state-run trading firm COFCO is the approved importer for canola at Qingdao.\n\nCBH's stem website lists the owner of the canola as CBH Grain, the trading arm of the grower-owned cooperative.\n\nCanola is a significant crop for Australian grain growers. (ABC Goldfields: Joanna Prendergast)\n\nFive-year lockout\n\nFive years ago Chinese authorities said the fungal disease blackleg was detected in a shipment of Australian canola and closed the trade.\n\nSince then, China, which is a significant canola producer in its own right, has relied significantly on imports of canola from Canada to top up its needs.\n\nBut earlier this year it blocked Canadian canola seed imports by imposing a massive tariff in a move thought to be related to a stoush over Canadian tariffs on electric vehicles.\n\nIn September, Australian government forecasting agency ABARES suggested the completion of a phytosanitary framework addressing China's concerns could pave the way for five trial shipments of Australian canola.\n\nOil-rich canola seed will be sent to China as part of the trial. (ABC Rural: Rose Grant)\n\nFuture potential\n\nAustralia is the world's second-largest exporter of canola and this year's 5.2-million tonne crop is expected to be worth $4.2 billion.\n\nThe majority of the canola exported comes from Western Australia.\n\nGrain Trade Australia chief executive Pat O'Shannassy said given that China was the world's largest buyer of canola, the reopening of trade could offer significant opportunities for Australian producers.\n\n\"The negotiation process around biosecurity and quarantine, it doesn't move as fast as, say, technology \u2014 once you lose access it is very difficult to get it back,\" he said.\n\nMr O'Shannassy said once the trial was complete it would be essential that government continued to negotiate for fully restored market access.\n\n\"Having more demand in the market is a good thing for growers \u2026 the China market for Australia, particularity for grains, is very important and long-standing,\" he said.\n\n\"If we can get that trade flowing again it will be significant for both Australia and China.\"\n\nA Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry spokesperson said there was \"an active and ongoing government-government discussion\" and that details were yet to be finalised.\n\nGood news for prices\n\nIn its September market update ABARES predicted a moderate increase in canola prices for the coming harvest.\n\nDennis Voznesenski says China re-entering the Australia canola market would support prices. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nCommonwealth Bank agricultural economist Dennis Voznesenski said a formal resumption of Australian canola trade with China would be a significant boon for Australian farmers.\n\n\"It would definitely be supportive [of prices]\" he said.\n\n\"Fingers crossed that that shipment sails smoothly and we then have further shipments.\n\n\"Its incredibly important this year because our largest typical buyer, Europe, they had a much larger crop this year \u2026 so Europe wont need as much locally.\n\n\"So we're really in a place where where we need another buyer and if that buyer is China then that's really good news.\"\n\nMr Voznesenski said markets were volatile when driven by politics.\n\n\"With these shipments, you've got to keep in mind that, even if they are large purchases, even if it's from us or the US in the past, there are times that those shipments have been cancelled and that's what we've got to keep an eye on.\"",

(ABC Gold Coast: Danielle Mahe)\n\nOffers for prime real estate rejected\n\nThe QCWA has more than 220 branches, which operate from hundreds of halls across the state.\n\nWhile each branch is responsible for the upkeep of its hall, it is the association that owns the properties.\n\nState vice-president Sue Baillie said she was not surprised by the interest from developers, considering the Gold Coast had one of the tightest rental markets in the country.\n\n\"Obviously, it's in prime real estate territory,\" Ms Baillie said.\n\n\"But the members are really passionate about their branch and the building is kept in good condition, so they're quite happy to go ahead and have the premises heritage listed, and we sanction that as well.\"\n\nShe said the QCWA recently turned down offers from developers who were interested in purchasing its hall in Cleveland in south-east Queensland, which was damaged by a suspicious fire in September.\n\nSue Baillie says the QCWA Coolangatta branch boasts the biggest membership in south-east Queensland. (Supplied: QCWA)\n\nMs Baillie said the organisation would only offload properties if there were not enough members to form a branch.\n\n\"If the branch in that area has closed \u2014 and this is happening in a lot of country areas where membership numbers get so low and it's not worth having a branch there \u2014 we've been selling those halls off,\" she said.\n\nSuch was the fate of the QCWA hall in Rockhampton, which was sold in 2014 due to dwindling membership, as well as its state-heritage-listed hostel in Ipswich, which sold for $2 million earlier this year.\n\nIn some cases, the QCWA will gift properties back to the community, like it did with its hall in Maryborough.\n\nHowever, Ms Baillie said there were no plans to sell the hall in Coolangatta, given it had one of the biggest branches in south-east Queensland, with 32 members.\n\nThe hall is in prime real estate territory. (ABC Gold Coast: Glenn Mullane)\n\nPush for local heritage status\n\nTo be listed on the local heritage register, a property must meet one or more of the following criteria: historical, scientific, typological, aesthetic or social and spiritual significance.\n\nHeritage expert Benjamin Gall said the QCWA hall in Coolangatta should have been listed on the local heritage register several years ago because it met the threshold for historical and social value.\n\nHowever, Mr Gall said even if the application was successful, its local heritage status would not protect it from being developed, relocated or demolished.\n\nBenjamin Gall says local heritage status does not protect a building from being demolished. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\n\"Places that are entered on the local heritage register can be demolished, but what it does is provides the correct level of an assessment to occur,\" he said.\n\n\"It compels owners to prove that it is the only prudent and feasible option.\"\n\nGold Coast councillor Gail O'Neill, whose division takes in Coolangatta, said regardless of the outcome, it was important to preserve the town's history for future generations.\n\n\"Coolangatta goes back a long way. It was a town in its own right. Once upon a time we had our own mayor,\" Cr O'Neill said.\n\n\"We want to keep the heritage and the southern Gold Coast alive. So, I think it's only the right thing to do.\"\n\nPublic submissions about the proposed heritage listing closed on October 20 and will be discussed at a council meeting later this month.",

    "text": "A back stress injury meant Uwland missed this year\u2019s championships after an outstanding bottom-age campaign last year that had him pegged as the best prospect in the 2025 class. The man viewed as Errol Gulden 2.0 did not reach those heights in the limited football he played after recovering, but his football IQ is as good as anyone\u2019s in this draft. He boasts silky skills and can run all day. Might captain the Suns one day. If not: There has been noise for a while, which heated up during the trade period, that the Eagles might bid on Carlton father-son defender Harry Dean. They could also opt to bid on Dylan Patterson or Daniel Annable here. Patterson might be the most damaging and exciting player in this year\u2019s draft. He takes the game on with his kicking and fast feet \u2013 including a nasty goose step \u2013 and sometimes tries to do too much, but showed in a VFL game against Carlton late in the season that he can rein his attacking nature in. Likened to Andrew McLeod, Patterson rejected NRL clubs\u2019 overtures to stay on the AFL path, and could be a difference-maker for the Suns.\n\nIf not: Gold Coast will desperately hope this doesn\u2019t happen because it would cruel their chances of securing their five fancied academy prospects. West Coast might pick Cooper Duff-Tytler instead, or bid on Dean or Annable. The Eagles have long been linked to Duff-Tytler, a talented ex-basketballer who boasts similar traits to AFL ruck stars Luke Jackson and Tom De Koning with his athleticism, leap, agility and follow-up work. He showed in a VFL appearance for Essendon, where he played predominantly as a forward, that he can impact the game in attack as well, even if that remains a query in some quarters. Should develop rapidly in an AFL environment. If not: Some recruiters think the Eagles would at least consider Sullivan Robey. There is also a chance Richmond are already picking here, and they could snap up Robey before placing bids.\n\nRobey is this year\u2019s bolter, after many clubs hoped they could keep him a secret once he graduated from Rowville\u2019s senior side to belatedly burst onto the scene for the Ranges mid-season. He grew about 17 centimetres in the past two years and developed physically, in equal parts owing to an impressive home gym and his dedication. First made his mark as a lead-up forward, then showed his strength and power as a midfielder. If not: The Tigers might start bidding first. They are also linked to Xavier Taylor and Sam Grlj. The Lions\u2019 premiership window will never shut if kids like Annable keep popping up, after the Ashcroft brothers arrived in recent years. Annable racks up disposals, excels at stoppages and is creative by hand. There are all sorts of flattering comparisons ahead of the draft each year, and recruiters see a bit of Simon Black in Annable. Brisbane will gleefully match any bid on Annable, and would quietly be chuffed if it comes this late. If not: The Tigers either stopped bidding and selected Taylor or Grlj, or bid on Dean instead.\n\nThis would be ideal for the Blues, given Dean is widely rated as a top-five talent. A bid here would also not wipe out both their first-round picks. Dean is one of the best key defender prospects in years, and stands out because there is a major shortage of that position in this crop. He aggressively flies for marks and spoils, reads the ball superbly, and has the athleticism and composure to thrive at the top level. If not: A Dean bid has already come and gone, and the Tigers are bidding on someone else. It would be a shock if Dean did not receive a bid by this pick.\n\nTaylor once polarised because of inconsistent decision-making and execution, including a habit for kicking into the man on the mark \u2013 but he has cleaned that up (mostly), and risen sharply on draft boards. Was best afield in the Ranges\u2019 grand final triumph, where his intercepting skills, athleticism, versatility and competitiveness were on show. Importantly, there is confidence Taylor will stand up defensively in the AFL. If not: The Tigers went for Sam Grlj\u2019s combination of blazing speed, endurance and athleticism. The Bombers could shape the draft with their back-to-back picks. The suspicion is they will invest in midfielders after parting with Dylan Shiel, Will Setterfield and Ben Hobbs, on top of the Zach Merrett situation, Darcy Parish\u2019s injury history, and with Elijah Tsatas still proving himself. Sharp won the Larke Medal as the best-performed player at the championships, and is a physical, competitive onballer who wins the ball in big doses. If not: Essendon have also been linked to Sam Cumming, Jacob Farrow and forward-ruck Aidan Schubert.\n\nA shoulder injury cut Cumming\u2019s season short, but not before he stamped himself as a potential top-10 selection. He is a dual-position threat who can impact the game as a deep forward with his marking ability and knack for kicking goals, or as a midfielder, where his physicality, aggression and dynamism are all ticks. There have even been Mark Ricciuto comparisons. Recruiters also like Cumming\u2019s defensive commitment. If not: The Bombers might instead opt for Farrow, who some believe has more upside and would likely start at half-back before eventually moving into the midfield. The Demons are never afraid to go against the grain. This is higher than Nairn has been projected, but Melbourne have him in their sights. Nairn had a seven-goal game at the championships before demonstrating his ball-winning wares with consecutive 30-plus-disposal outings to end the season. He is a high IQ footballer, can run all day as a wingman, could develop into an inside midfielder, marks well overhead and is a neat kick.\n\nIf not: They would love Sam Cumming to still be on the board, and might select small forward Lachy Dovaston, defender Jacob Farrow or try to fortify their key defensive posts for the future with Blake Thredgold. Dovaston, who hails from the same Talent League club as Nick Watson, is the best small forward in this draft. He might lack Watson\u2019s tricks, but still has his share, and has greater running capacity and is considered superior defensively to when the star Hawk was the same age. Dovaston kicks goals for fun (and lots of them), is consistent, has become more selfless, runs hard up and down the ground, and tested brilliantly at the combine. If not: Farrow would give the Demons another kicking weapon across half-back, and could become a midfielder in time. Thredgold would also make sense with Steven May nearing the end of his career, while they could pair Latrelle Pickett with his cousin Kysaiah.\n\nLittle is known across the league about the Hawks\u2019 plans, but Farrow would be a good get. His draft range starts at Essendon\u2019s picks, and he has admirers into the mid-teens. Farrow is one of the best kicks in this class, makes quick decisions, impacts the game as an interceptor, and showed his agility in combine testing. He has also performed well in the midfield, but is more proven down back, where he will start and possibly stay in the AFL. If not: The Hawks might go for Sam Grlj\u2019s mix of speed and endurance, or they could look to bolster their forward line with one of Mitch Marsh, Aidan Schubert or Archie Ludowyke. The Blues might lose this pick, depending on where a Harry Dean bid comes. They would love Lachy Dovaston to still be available, but Grlj has speed to burn and was one of only two players to run the two-kilometre time trial quicker than six minutes at the combine. He entered top-five calculations with a superb start to the year before hitting a rough patch, but his VFL form for Richmond was excellent. Grlj could eventually become a midfielder. If not: Carlton might continue their small forward pursuit and pick Latrelle Pickett, or could be in the market for a defender such as Oskar Taylor or Josh Lindsay, who bring different strengths.\n\n15. Oskar Taylor (GWS) South Belgrave/Eastern Ranges\n\nDefender, 183cm, 2/5/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 20.5 disposals, 3.2 rebound 50s, 5.1 intercept possessions It is dangerous to predict what the Giants might do, but Taylor seems a good fit. His stocks increased the longer the year went after not playing at the championships, capped by his eye-catching results at the combine, where he set the fastest 20-metre sprint time and finished second for agility. Taylor puts that acceleration to great use to quickly create separation and get the ball moving forward. He can tidy up his kicking and improve defensively. If not: The Giants have also been linked to Latrelle Pickett, while Grlj would be in contention if he were available. Others mentioned were Archie Ludowyke and West Coast next-generation academy forward Tylah Williams. 16. Latrelle Pickett (West Coast)\n\nTumby Bay/Glenelg\n\nForward, 182cm, 28/12/2005\n\nSANFL reserves stats (avg): 11.9 disposals, 4.9 score involvements, 1.8 goals Melbourne star Kysaiah Pickett\u2019s cousin has top-20 interest in what is an even crop, but there is a chance he is still up for grabs in the 20s. Pickett turns 20 in December, so he is slightly older than his draft peers, but has impressed this year with his progress at Glenelg. The Eagles are among the clubs that have kept a close eye on Pickett, who is quick, elusive, capable of the mercurial, and has the cheek that the best small forwards possess. If not: The Eagles might opt for the safer option of sweet-kicking defender Josh Lindsay, or could grab a forward such as Aidan Schubert, Mitch Marsh or Archie Ludowyke. 17. Josh Lindsay (Western Bulldogs) Newtown & Chilwell/Geelong Falcons/Victoria Country\n\nDefender/midfielder, 183cm, 7/4/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 20.5 disposals, 7 contested possessions, 3.7 intercept possessions\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 22.3 disposals, 4.8 intercept possessions, 444 metres gained\n\n2025 All-Australian\n\nLindsay is an excellent decision-maker and arguably the best kick in the draft \u2013 the result of years of dedication honing his skills, including a strict morning routine \u2013 so this would be a good result for the Bulldogs. He has been a consistently high performer at all levels, and is viewed as a safe selection who could slot straight into a defensive role. There are varying opinions on whether Lindsay could develop into a midfielder. Josh Lindsay won the best on ground medal playing for the Australia under-18a against Coburg VFL in April. Credit: via Getty Images If not: The Dogs have a key defensive need, so they could go for Thredgold, who is comfortably the best tall backman still available. 18. Blake Thredgold (Adelaide) Payneham Norwood Union/Sturt/South Australia\n\nDefender, 194cm, 27/8/2007\n\nSANFL U18 stats (avg): 11.6 disposals, 5.4 marks, 2 intercept marks\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 13 disposals, 5 marks, 1 intercept mark\n\nRecruiters took notice of Thredgold\u2019s solid job last year as a bottom-ager on future Collingwood forward Charlie West. He also quelled fellow first-round prospect Mitch Marsh in this year\u2019s SANFL under-18 grand final and dominated in the air to cap a strong finals series. Thredgold is on North Melbourne\u2019s radar, but the Crows might get in first. He is a tad undersized but a genuine lockdown defender who is strong, athletic and competitive. If not: There are lots of South Australian options, if the Crows want to go down that path. Marsh, Aidan Schubert, Jevan Phillipou and Harley Barker would all be viable options. 19. Archie Ludowyke (Geelong) East Sandringham/Sandringham Dragons/Victoria Metro\n\nForward, 197cm, 19/11/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 9.3 disposals, 3.3 F50 marks, 3.3 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 4 disposals, 1 mark, 1.7 score involvements Ludowyke started the year brightly for the Dragons and the AFL Academy after long being rated the best key forward in this class. However, he had a goalless championships \u2013 which was not all his fault, as a player relying on service \u2013 before suffering a season-ending PCL injury in Metro\u2019s win over the Allies. This would be a classic Cats play to invest in a player with good size and athleticism who launches himself at the Sherrin.\n\nLoading If not: Geelong regularly, and successfully, ignore the status quo in the draft. Mitch Marsh, Aidan Schubert, Louis Emmett and Harley Barker might be in play. Or could they bid on Jai Murray (Gold Coast) or Tylah Williams (West Coast)? 20. Mitch Marsh (Fremantle) Kangarilla/West Adelaide/South Australia\n\nForward, 190cm, 15/2/2007\n\nSANFL U18 stats (avg): 12.5 disposals, 6.1 marks, 2 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 8.5 disposals, 6 marks, 3 goals\n\n2025 All-Australian The Dockers gleefully drafted 2025 Rising Star winner Murphy Reid at around this pick last year, and could unearth another bargain in Marsh, who kicked the most goals at the 2025 championships. He emerged from the carnival as a top-10 contender who some thought could play other positions, but appears to have slid after a so-so end to the season. But the talent and upside are there, and Marsh could add to a talented Freo forward line.\n\nIf not: The Dockers could place a bid on West Coast next-generation academy forward Tylah Williams, or might punt on upside with one of All-Australian winger Harley Barker or talented forward Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves. 21. Aidan Schubert (Essendon) Gawler Central/Central District/South Australia\n\nForward/ruckman, 196cm, 21/12/2007\n\nSANFL U18s stats (avg): 19.2 disposals, 4.4 clearances, 2.2 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 17 disposals, 3.3 F50 marks, 2.5 goals\n\n2025 All-Australian The Bombers might snap up Schubert with one of their first two picks, so would probably be delighted if he is still up for grabs here. His awkward ball drop and kicking style are talking points, and put some clubs off, while he measured shorter than some scouts expected. But Schubert had an outstanding championships to surge into the top-10 mix. Talls can sometimes drift, given the risks involved, but his competitiveness and endurance appeal. If not: There are interesting names still available, so Essendon may continue the midfield theme with Oliver Greeves, add more talent to their front end with Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves, or go for ACL-recovering winger Harley Barker.\n\nLoading 22. Oliver Greeves (Hawthorn) Vermont/Eastern Ranges/Victoria Metro\n\nMidfielder, 191cm, 7/2/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 25.5 disposals, 9.8 contested possessions, 1.1 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 25 disposals, 11.8 contested possessions, 4.5 clearances\n\n2025 All-Australian Greeves is linked to the Hawks by virtue of their rejected application to include him in their next-generation academy program because of his Indigenous background. He also trained with them during the pre-season through the AFL Academy. Greeves is polarising \u2013 with most queries centred on his running ability \u2013 but a contested beast who has the height and ability to also impact the game when he plays as a marking forward. If not: Hawthorn did a great job rebuilding their list in the draft, and in trade and free agency, so there are not many holes. They can probably afford to take a risk on Harley Barker, or show patience with someone such as Louis Emmett.\n\nSecond round 23. Louis Emmett (North Melbourne) Glen Iris/Oakleigh Chargers/Victoria Metro\n\nRuckman/forward, 199cm, 23/3/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 15.3 disposals, 9.3 contested possessions, 1.1 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 12.7 disposals, 4.3 marks, 2 clearances There is talk the Kangaroos might trade for Gold Coast\u2019s pick 18 (before it is absorbed in matching bids), but it is unclear if that move is directly related to trying to select key defender Blake Thredgold. The popular view on Emmett, who finished third in the time trial at the combine, is that he will need to develop into a key-position player at either end \u2013 but there is upside here. His draft range starts far earlier than this and could be wider. If not: Could the Roos bid on some of the glut of players in this part of the draft, such as Sydney\u2019s Max King, Harry Kyle and Lachy Carmichael, Essendon\u2019s Adam Sweid, Gold Coast\u2019s Jai Murray and Beau Addinsall, Carlton\u2019s Jack Ison or Collingwood\u2019s Zac McCarthy?\n\n24. Harry Kyle (Sydney match North Melbourne bid) UNSW-Eastern Suburbs Bulldogs/Sydney Academy/Allies\n\nDefender/midfielder, 188cm, 16/7/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 20.8 disposals, 9.3 contested possessions, 1.1 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 12.5 disposals, 10.3 uncontested possessions, 1.3 intercept possessions As always with bids, particularly in this region of the draft, there is a great unknown, but recruiters think this is roughly where Kyle might bob up. The Swans academy product finished top 10 in three tests at the combine, including winning the running vertical jump. Part of Kyle\u2019s appeal is that this was his first year in the academy, so there is serious scope for improvement. He is a good size, has a big tank and brings positional versatility. If not: The Kangaroos might bid on someone else, or not at all. They previously drafted Brayden George off an ACL, so they may be wary to do so again with Harley Barker, but the South Australian could reap great rewards. Other options might be Jevan Phillipou or Riley Onley. 25. Jevan Phillipou (North Melbourne)\n\nLoading PHOS Camden/Woodville-West Torrens/South Australia\n\nMidfielder/forward, 183cm, 30/3/2007\n\nSANFL U18 stats (avg): 22.7 disposals, 9.7 contested possessions, 4.9 clearances Just like his St Kilda-listed brother Mattaes, Phillipou made an impression with his supreme confidence in club interviews. Injury sidelined him from the championships, and at different stages of his junior career, but there is plenty to like, including how self-driven and talented he is. The ex-decathlete is a good athlete, and brings the speed and dynamism that clubs want. Some recruiters rate him in the teens, so don\u2019t be surprised if he is long gone. If not: The Roos could go for someone else in this range, such as Harley Barker or Riley Onley, but rival recruiters don\u2019t expect them to go for Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves, given his similarities to Zane Duursma. 26. Harley Barker (Essendon)\n\nMount Barker/Sturt/South Australia\n\nWingman, 188cm, 2/5/2007\n\nSANFL U18 stats (avg): 16.8 disposals, 6.8 marks, 3.2 clearances\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 16 disposals, 3.3 inside 50s, 5.8 score involvements\n\n2025 All-Australian There is risk with Barker, who sustained an ACL rupture playing for Sturt after earning All-Australian honours. If a club is willing to take that on board, there is so much to like about Barker\u2019s prospects, given he was considered a top-10 smokey after his championships performance. His size, speed, endurance and skill add up to an impressive package, and he uses his running ability to get involved at both ends. There is a chance he slides. If not: The Dons might bid on a player instead, but might not want to tempt fate on their academy players Adam Sweid and Hussien El Achkar. Other options include Riley Onley, Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves and Sam Swadling. 27. Jack Ison (Carlton match Essendon bid) Parkside/Oakleigh Chargers/Victoria Metro\n\nMidfielder/forward, 191cm, 26/3/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 20.5 disposals, 4.5 clearances, 4.5 tackles\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 13.3 disposals, 4.7 score involvements, 3.7 tackles\n\nLoading Injuries impacted the start of Ison\u2019s season, but the Blues\u2019 next-generation academy prospect finished strongly \u2013 and opposition recruiters took notice. Ison\u2019s height and aerial prowess make him a candidate to fill various roles across the ground, beyond just the midfield. There is still a smallish sample size on him, but the scouting report acknowledges that he can do things others in this range cannot, so Carlton will gleefully match a bid. If not: There are a heap of other players in this part of the draft who are connected to clubs, and clubs will likely start bidding upon them somewhere here. 28. Max King (Sydney match Essendon bid) Cardiff Hawks/Sydney Swans Academy/Allies\n\nForward/midfielder, 191cm, 1/9/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 14 disposals, 3.8 marks, 2.3 tackles\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 7.3 disposals, 2.7 marks, 0.7 goals\n\nCould the Bombers make a double bid? There is probably not a better athlete in this draft, and he blew everyone away with his 80-centimetre vertical jump at the combine. King took some breathtaking grabs throughout the season, and his individual highlights and potential are why he was once viewed as a top-10 contender \u2013 and why a bid could come in the teens. The challenge in rating him is whether his football IQ will catch up to his athleticism. If not: As above, there are many other bidding candidates, or players such as Riley Onley, Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves and Sam Swadling likely come into calculations. 29. Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves (Essendon) Mornington/Dandenong Stingrays/Victoria Country\n\nForward, 186cm, 16/11/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 16.3 disposals, 1.9 F50 marks, 1.5 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 12 disposals, 8.8 uncontested possessions, 1.5 goals The glimpses are incredibly exciting when it comes to Hibbins-Hargreaves, who produced some enormous performances in his draft season, including several bags of goals. He is best suited as a forward, where his class and skill come to the fore. That said, there are concerns about Hibbins-Hargreaves\u2019 inconsistency and contest work at ground level. Some recruiters would not consider him here, but others might jump earlier than this.\n\nIf not: Could the Bombers pick their own academy product, Adam Sweid, here instead? Rival recruiters have asked that question. 30. Lachy Carmichael (Sydney match Western Bulldogs bid)\n\nSydney Swans Academy/North Shore Bombers/Allies\n\nDefender, 183cm, 27/8/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 27 disposals, 7.7 contested possessions, 5.7 intercept possessions\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 24.8 disposals, 4.8 rebound 50s, 6 score involvements\n\n2025 All-Australian Will the Swans match a third academy player in the top 30? In a draft where many prospects are flawed or erratic, Carmichael\u2019s ultra-consistency across several years is a big tick. He was an All-Australian at under-16 level in 2023, and earned that same honour at this year\u2019s under-18 championships, where he was also the Allies\u2019 MVP. Carmichael is defensively sound, but his kicking and relative lack of athleticism keep him in this range. If not: Sydney may not match a Carmichael bid if it comes so soon after ones on Harry Kyle and Max King, but it will be interesting to see. The Dogs could also bid on any number of other club-tied prospects, including Gold Coast pair Jai Murray and Beau Addinsall.",

    "text": "\u201cOne way to let your wrist alleviate stress away is by practicing some twist movement, and I\u2019m feeling better already,\u201d Sungkar wrote in one post flashing a Rolex Datejust Wimbledon in a video that appears to have been filmed while he was working in NAB\u2019s business centre. Loading In another, Sungkar proudly poses inside a Tokyo branch of the pre-owned luxury watch retailer Okura with a Hublot watch worth up to $30,000. In other posts, Sungkar proudly displays an Audemars Piguet worth up to $35,000. Addressing the growing scandal for the first time, NAB chief executive Andrew Irvine on Thursday told the this masthead: \u201cInsider fraud is always difficult, we\u2019ve got zero tolerance for it, and you can be sure that we\u2019re looking at all of our processes and controls to make sure that those are strengthened as we go forward.\u201d Sungkar has been sacked by the bank, having initially been stood down pending the outcome of internal and police investigations.\n\nSungkar had worked for the bank since 2008, when he was employed in a customer advisory role, and was promoted to a senior position in October 2018 when he returned from an 18-month stint working as a mortgage broker. He was promoted to his position, in which he dealt directly with mortgage brokers who provided him with documents for loan applications, in August 2022. Several other NAB employees are under investigation for allegedly facilitating home and business loans for the syndicate under the direction of the Penthouse Syndicate\u2019s alleged ringleader, Shanghai-born 38-year-old Bing \u201cMichael\u201d Li. Those employees have not been charged, but have been stood down from their positions pending the outcome of an internal investigation and detectives\u2019 probe into the employees\u2019 alleged involvement with the syndicate. No NAB customers have been targeted in the alleged fraud. Detectives have arrested 16 syndicate members since Strike Force Myddleton was formed last January to investigate a $10 million fraud scheme involving the purchase of non-existent luxury cars in Sydney\u2019s west.\n\n\u201cI said that we\u2019d be coming for them, and we\u2019ve started,\u201d Detective Superintendent Gordon Arbinja, commander of the financial crimes squad, told this masthead. \u201cAnd this person won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Detective Superintendent Gordon Arbinja, commander of the financial crimes squad, said further arrests linked to the Penthouse Syndicate are expected. Credit: Janie Barrett In what was a major catalyst for the Penthouse Syndicate\u2019s spectacular downfall, Li was arrested in July in the $18 million penthouse of the Crown\u2019s residential tower at Barangaroo, from where police say he directed the syndicate. Detectives believe the syndicate has defrauded several of the major banks and other financiers of more than $250 million dating back at least seven years. Li\u2019s arrest and the subsequent investigation into the NAB employees has brought police scrutiny to professionals working on the outskirts of the finance industry, including corrupt solicitors, mortgage brokers and real estate agents who police say form a network of facilitators that helped the syndicate build its multimillion-dollar property portfolio.\n\n\u201cAt every single point of the transaction, there\u2019s trust. Whether it\u2019s a banker, whether it\u2019s a solicitor, a conveyancer, a valuer \u2013 there\u2019s always an element of trust that the bank relies upon \u2013 and every single time, that trust has been violated,\u201d Arbinja said. Li, who remains in custody after several failed bail applications, has been charged with more than 80 offences related to $12.9 million worth of fraud linked to the luxury car scheme and other frauds, but police allege he was heavily involved in orchestrating a large portion of the alleged NAB fraud and has, through mules hired by the syndicate, bought several properties in the past two years. Detectives allege Li has orchestrated the laundering of millions of dollars through the purchase of property and other assets. The Penthouse Syndicate\u2019s alleged ringleader, Bing \u201cMichael\u201d Li, was arrested in the penthouse of the Crown\u2019s residential tower in July. Other NAB employees at several locations across Sydney are suspected of receiving bribes from the syndicate to approve home and business loan applications, which police allege they knew were submitted with fraudulent documents including company records, tax returns and financial statements. The syndicate\u2019s alleged infiltration of the finance giant raises questions about what anti-corruption measures were in place at the bank, which became aware of the alleged fraud and its scale only through the police investigation.\n\nIn July, NAB finalised an enforceable undertaking with the federal government\u2019s anti-money laundering and financial crimes watchdog, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Loading In exchange for being spared a multimillion-dollar fine, NAB agreed to improve its compliance with anti-money laundering laws and counter-terrorism financing laws. Despite the scrutiny on the bank\u2019s fraud and money-laundering controls, most of the Penthouse Syndicate\u2019s alleged defrauding of NAB was carried out while the undertaking was in place. Sungkar was allegedly paid $17,000 to facilitate fraudulent business loans worth millions of dollars for \u201cshell\u201d companies purchased by the syndicate. Sungkar was allegedly paid through transfers made to his now-estranged wife\u2019s bank account by Li.\n\nPenthouse Syndicate members have purchased several of the companies, which typically have a minimum of two years\u2019 trading history, for between $5000 and $10,000. Police allege the syndicate has used fraudulent financial documents linked to the companies to inflate members\u2019 income, allowing them to secure multimillion-dollar mortgage and business loans. Sungkar is alleged to have approved fraudulent business loans worth millions for several shell companies linked to syndicate members Hanna Karliana and her partner, Indra Hari Nurkianto. Karliana, 61, and Nurkianto, 60, were in August charged with a number of offences over their alleged roles in the Penthouse Syndicate. Police allege Sungkar facilitated fraudulent business loans for syndicate members Hanna Karliana and Indra Hari Nurkianto. Credit: Instagram Police allege the couple bought $15 million worth of property \u2013 two CBD apartments and a Bellevue Hill townhouse \u2013 on behalf of the syndicate using fraudulent documents. Sungkar is accused of facilitating millions of dollars worth of business loans for shell companies of which Karliana and Nurkianto were directors. \u201cThis person, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is the gatekeeper of funds,\u201d Arbinja said.\n\n\u201cWtihout this person, the fraud cannot be facilitated. So he\u2019s in a position of trust. He violated that trust, and now, we know that over $200 million in funds have been attributed to this organised crime syndicate.\u201d Loading Chris Sheehan, head of NAB\u2019s group investigations and fraud business unit, said the bank had \u201czero tolerance for employees who engage in criminal conduct\u201d. \u201cThere is absolutely no place for financial crime in our community and we recognise the important role we play in the monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity, working closely with police as well as regulators and government agencies as necessary,\u201d Sheehan said. Sheehan said NAB was working with police and providing \u201csignificant support to aid the investigation and attempted recovery of any funds lost to criminal activity\u201d.\n\nArbinja said NAB had co-operated with the police investigation since it became aware of the alleged fraud. \u201cThese types of syndicates can only be investigated thoroughly with the proper cooperation of our banking partners. It can\u2019t be done solely with police,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot get to this day without the bank\u2019s assistance.\u201d Beyond NAB, detectives are investigating the syndicate\u2019s suspected infiltration of the country\u2019s other major banks, which the group is believed to have defrauded. The NSW Crime Commission has seized $60 million worth of property, cars and luxury goods linked to Li, his partner, Zhouyao \u201cYumi\u201d Chen and other syndicate members.\n\nChen, 37, has been charged with several offences related both to the luxury car scheme, and more than $4 million worth of allegedly fraudulent NAB mortgage and business loans. Karliana and Nurkianto\u2019s daughter-in-law, Thi Ngo Hao Vu, 35, has been charged with a number of offences related to $3.2 million worth of allegedly fraudulent mortgage and business loans. According to court documents, another senior NAB banking manager allegedly approved a $2 million mortgage application and a business loan worth almost $500,000 after advising Li, Vu and her husband, Ibnu Pratama, which documents would be needed to secure the loan. The mortgage was used to purchase Bondi Junction beauty salon Beauty Pavilion. Pratama left Australia in December 2023, a week after detectives raided the home of one of his, Li and Vu\u2019s Beauty Pavilion business partners. He has not returned to the country. A warrant for his arrest was issued in September.",

    "text": "But as the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s head of Australian economics Belinda Allen noted, there might not be any further rate cuts. \u201cWe expect it would take a material move higher in the unemployment rate, together with more moderate inflation prints, to bring the RBA back to the cutting table,\u201d she said. Something not in Chau\u2019s question, or remarked upon by Bullock itself, is how the economy and Australian consumers are performing with the cash rate at 3.6 per cent. Every major lender has reported in recent weeks that delinquency rates - the proportion of people behind on their mortgages - is actually falling (from barely elevated levels). Household consumption has lifted, both in quantity and value. The private sector is, as the RBA noted, starting to take over from the public sector.\n\nThere is real financial pain in parts of the community while unemployment has ticked up. Foodbank this week reported that half of all renters are suffering some form of \u201cfood insecurity\u201d which means they are trying everything from reducing the quality and variety of food to skipping meals. Foodbank Queensland volunteers at the food distribution warehouse in Brisbane. Demand for its services remains at very high levels. Credit: @foodbankqld The Reserve\u2019s own liaison program with charities is finding that demand for services continues to exceed supply, with the biggest pressure points \u201chomelessness, emergency financial and food support and domestic violence\u201d. What\u2019s been surprising, however, has been the lack of widespread and demonstrable financial damage across the nation\u2019s army of borrowers who have borne the brunt of the RBA\u2019s actions.\n\nAfter the Reserve started lifting the cash rate from its 0.1 per cent pandemic-era low, there were real fears for the huge proportion of mortgage holders who had taken fixed rate loans. Loading When these loans re-set at much higher rates, the argument ran, Australians en masse would tumble lemming-like off a \u201cmortgage cliff\u201d. That would be on top of all those people with variable rate mortgages who would struggle to survive. But the cliff and economic disaster didn\u2019t eventuate. Research compiled by a group of economists including several from the e61 think tank, released this week, suggests Australians\u2019 use of offset and redraw accounts may be the nation\u2019s economic secret sauce.\n\nWhile annual repayments on variable mortgage lifted by an average $13,800, the economists found the impact on consumer spending was muted. One of the report\u2019s authors, Gianni La Cava, said people used their mortgage offset and redraw facilities, enabling them to maintain their spending. And, as rates came down, most borrowers did not reduce their repayments. They started rebuilding their mortgage-linked savings. This has major repercussions for the Reserve Bank and how it thinks movements in interest rates work and whether 3.6 per cent will actually bring inflation under control. \u201cThe borrower cash flow channel of monetary policy may have weakened in both directions. The resilience that helped households weather higher rates may also dull the stimulus from lower ones,\u201d La Cava said.\n\nReserve Bank data shows even as the share of household income used to pay mortgages hits 10 per cent, the level of excess mortgage repayments has grown. While the bank will never admit it, especially during a heated political battle over the nation\u2019s housing market, there is a concern that ever-lower interest rates will supercharge property prices. In this week\u2019s quarterly monetary policy statement, the bank revealed that for every 10 per cent lift in housing prices, economic growth is 0.7 per cent higher. In dollar terms, that\u2019s an $18.5 billion jump in economic activity. \u201cThe boost to GDP growth also flows through to higher inflation; in particular, we would expect new dwelling inflation to rise sharply as capacity pressures in housing construction increase,\u201d it noted.\n\nThat increase in activity would push up underlying inflation by about 0.25 percentage points. Such a lift would not only kill any prospect of further rate relief, it would put a rate increase on the agenda. The Grattan Institute noted this week in its report advocating major changes to capital city planning rules that the nation\u2019s ratio of house prices to income has soared over the past two decades. Sydney\u2019s median house cost 6.3 times the median household income back in 2001. Now that median house costs around $1.5 million or almost 10 times median household income. Brisbane and Adelaide have seen even larger increases in the income needed to buy a new home while the ratio has almost doubled in Canberra (with a median house value approaching $1 million).\n\nOur higher priced houses require ever larger mortgages which means a larger share of household income now goes towards paying down the home loan. And yet people have managed to get ahead on their mortgages. All but the richest quarter of home borrowers are further ahead in their repayments today than before the pandemic. These issues, on top of all the other economic problems at play domestically and across the world, swirled around the Reserve Bank\u2019s meeting room as it discussed where interest rates may be headed. There was also an elephant in the room - the bank\u2019s past and current inflation performance. The RBA constantly undershot its 2-3 per cent inflation target across the five years leading up to the pandemic. It was one of the reasons the bank went through an independent review.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one. A three-hat chef and a prize-winning architect walk into an abandoned kiosk in a park. They turn it into what may well be the most significant restaurant opening in a decade. The punchline? Neither of them has ever opened one before. Yiaga, meaning \u201cto seek and find\u201d in Woiwurrung, the language of Melbourne\u2019s traditional owners, the Wurundjeri people, is a creative collaboration between Vue de Monde executive chef Hugh Allen and architect John Wardle. The Pavilion Cafe had sat abandoned in the Fitzroy Gardens on the eastern edge of the CBD for close to a decade. After a project five years and many millions of dollars in the making, the redesigned and renovated restaurant opened last month. It\u2019s tempting to slice a tall poppy before it\u2019s even had time to flower, to dismiss this as a restaurant made by (and for) people with money (Yiaga is partially backed by billionaire Singaporean brothers Philip and Robert Ng, who also own the majority share of three-hat fine diner Vue de Monde). And at $295 a head (excluding wine), with just 44 seats, the 12- to 15-course degustation menu \u2013 which rolls on for around three hours \u2013 is not designed for your average Fitzroy Gardens picnicker. Yiaga\u2019s founder and executive chef, Hugh Allen. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen But here\u2019s another way to look at it. The post-2020 hospitality scene has been in a bit of a share-plate slumber, dominated by grand bistros and neighbourhood diners, with the occasional creative jolt to the arm from small, fun, owner-operated restaurants. Safe, comforting, familiar. Now here\u2019s Yiaga: a dining experience that\u2019s sophisticated in pitch, mature in tone and -thoroughly realised. A loving dispatch to the colours, textures and flavours that make up Australia\u2019s changeable environment. Thoughtful, provocative and unfailingly stylish. In a world of designer chefs and the countless restaurants around the planet bearing their names \u2013 Robuchon, Ramsay, Boulud, Nobu \u2013 it\u2019s outliers such as Hugh Allen who bring something new to the table. A reminder that dining out can be more than a meal, it can be an art form. On that front, Australia is no slouch. In Victoria, there\u2019s Dan Hunter\u2019s farm-to-table Brae. In NSW, there\u2019s Daniel Puskas\u2019s progressive, ferment-driven Sixpenny, and Josh Niland\u2019s fish-focused Saint Peter. They all bring the noise when it comes to elite Australian fine-dining. But little of our extraordinary, diverse food scene has managed to hold attention on the world stage. Could Yiaga be the one to finally move the dial? I spent three days at the restaurant as they set up for their first guests to find out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 30-year-old chef is no stranger to excellence. Allen spent three years cooking at Noma, chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019s Copenhagen restaurant that\u2019s widely considered one of the world\u2019s greats, featuring a menu that dances a fine line between naturalist and futurist, executed with 10,000-hour precision. For chefs, working there is the culinary equivalent of training to become a green beret. At just 23, he became executive chef at Vue de Monde on the 55th floor of the Rialto Tower. At 26, he became the youngest chef in four decades to hold three hats. He\u2019s spent the past six years running Vue, which recently retained its three hats at The Age Good Food Guide Awards. Only four restaurants in Victoria currently hold that position. The restaurant is in Melbourne\u2019s Fitzroy Gardens. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen Despite all that, Hugh Allen is not a flashy guy. He has very little time for things that don\u2019t directly feed back into the restaurant he\u2019s invested so much of his heart, soul and money in. His iPhone is so cracked, it\u2019s like looking at a Magic Eye puzzle. His laptop screen, also damaged, has a huge black line through it. He\u2019s been hoping someone will knock it off one of the benches and completely destroy it so he can justify purchasing a new one. All this is thrown into sharp relief against his beautifully appointed new restaurant, where even the dessert spoons were hand-crafted by a silversmith. Besides, the show is not Hugh Allen himself, the show is Yiaga. For instance, it\u2019s unusual to see the self-assured, softly spoken chef at the pass (the divider between the kitchen and the outside world, where traditionally you\u2019d find the person running the show). That\u2019s head chef Michael McAulay\u2019s job. Another Noma alum, the 27-year-old moved from Scotland to Australia initially to work at Vue de Monde, where he was sous chef for two years, before spending the past year working on launching Yiaga with Allen. Together, they\u2019re a study in contrast. McAulay works on his toes, darting and weaving like a matador, holding the front line with a thick Glaswegian brogue. Allen floats with the quiet constancy of a Zen monk, speaking in lilting tones, gliding from one chef station to another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair aren\u2019t the only two Vue transplants. General manager Hugo Simoes and sommelier Dorian Guillon, both longtime members of the Vue team, have also made their way to the garden from the dark, lacquered surrounds of the 55th floor. Allen and Simoes will -continue to split their time between the two. Head chef Michael McAulay in the open kitchen. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen Maybe it\u2019s a generation/age thing, and maybe it\u2019s some of that aforementioned familiarity with his team creating a sense of comfort and calm, but the psychological warfare that would have previously been a hallmark of a kitchen operating at this level doesn\u2019t seem to exist. The impression is of a healthy kitchen culture (one of their hiring rules is a \u201cno dickhead -policy\u201d). Perhaps the idea of beauty only being achieved through -brutality is a concept of the past. If the energy from the 13-strong kitchen team (aged between 20 and 31) is anything to go by, it certainly is here. I ask Allen one afternoon how he deals with his internalised rage \u2013 a trait common in noteworthy chefs working in highly pressurised environments. (Infamous culinary torture artist Marco Pierre White once said, \u201cIf you are not extreme, then people will take shortcuts because they don\u2019t fear you.\u201d) Allen told me he doesn\u2019t have any such torment. And I believe him. He is probably the least angst-riddled chef I\u2019ve ever met. Loading Before guests arrive, front- and back-of-house sit down together for \u201cfamily meal\u201d: a chance for calm before the oncoming adrenal storm. Chefs eat generous plates of roast chicken, rice and roast baby zucchini like they mean business, focused on getting back to their stations as quickly as they can. There\u2019s a sense of urgency and industry in the air \u2013 tonight is the first night they\u2019ve all worked as a team. Allen walks around reminding everyone to get some fresh air and stretch before service. \u201cThey just want to get back to setting up,\u201d says Allen. \u201cEspecially when everything\u2019s new, it\u2019s always quite overwhelming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcAulay tours each station in the kitchen, trying the finishing elements of each dish on the menu. He\u2019s been tasting steadily throughout the day. \u201cA lot\n\nof it is the really fine detail,\u201d says the chef, dropping a teaspoon into a container of fresh water. \u201cNothing gets packed away until it gets tasted by me or Hugh. Thinking about everything again just dials you in. You tasted [the sauce] the first time, but then it\u2019s settled: does it need a tiny bit more salt, is it too intense?\u201d It also allows honest dialogue. Any problems with a dish can be flagged early enough to be fixed, creating a calmer environment for everyone. \u201cThe only reason you would pack something away if it hasn\u2019t been tasted is if something is wrong,\u201d says McAulay. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s really good here. I trust everyone.\u201d In the lead-up to opening, industry chatter was focused on what Allen would bring to the table as a chef outside the confines of Vue de Monde and its 25\u2011year legacy. Could he create something original? Would it be Vue 2.0? Noma in the park? The answer is mostly no, and very slightly yes. The vision, flavour and execution is most definitely Hugh Allen\u2019s. To put a dish through the Yiaga lens, Allen and McAulay asked themselves whether it is \u201cseek and find enough\u201d. It must push boundaries, flavour-wise. \u201cJust because it\u2019s an amazing dish somewhere else doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll make sense here,\u201d says McAulay. The open-plan kitchen flows into the dining space. \u201cI want my staff to really engage with the diners,\u201d says Allen. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen Coral trout, initially served with brassicas, felt too classic and European to the pair. Instead, they kept experimenting until they landed on barbecuing the Far North Queensland fish, pairing it with a cheek of new-season mango and sunrise lime, finally injecting it with the base heat of Mexican chilli oil, a suggestion from 29-year-old chef Eduardo Guasch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a wildness to the composition here, akin to a Turner landscape. A command of balance and restraint, executed with the kind of abandon only people who have learnt the rules can achieve when they decide to break them. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what \u2018here\u2019 feels like ourselves, yet,\u201d says Allen. \u201cWe\u2019re new here as well. But we want the food to be very interesting. We want to really push things.\u201d Corner Inlet squid from Gippsland were so large when they were delivered that they took up an entire kitchen benchtop. The flesh is gently confited and cured in white miso, dressed with desert lime, served in a light citrus broth and finished with the peppery tang of Thai basil. There\u2019s deep harmony in a set coconut cream layered with concentrated coconut water, finished with a lump of caviar, a touch of lime zest and a tiny hint of fresh-pressed macadamia oil. A dish so finely tuned that it dampens and mutes the surrounding sounds of the restaurant, just for a moment. Flavoured oils are used less like an ingredient and more like a perfume: gentle enhancements like Geraldton wax, and those macadamia and chilli oils. \u201cI think dining should be exciting,\u201d says Allen. \u201cFood that\u2019s aromatic. Ingredients you\u2019ve never had before, hopefully. Flavours that you can\u2019t work out. Obviously, with all that it still has to be delicious, but we want it to feel very new and really Aussie.\u201d Coconut cream and caviar: Yiaga\u2019s menu aims to \u201cpush the flavour boundaries\u201d. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen Kangaroo cutlets are gently cooked through service, starting raw at the top of the open hearth, slowly taking in smoke for flavour, then brought down over the coals, glazed with smoked butter and a concentrated sauce made from all the other parts of the kangaroo, served with maitake mushrooms poached in mushroom stock then grilled and glazed with cured egg yolk. They\u2019re looking farther afield at producers, too, utilising forgotten or under-appreciated ingredients. Slices of 14-year-old retired wagyu cow (which would normally be around four when they meet their fate) are draped over a bite-sized steamed bun. The meat, from producer David Blackmore, is very slightly salt-cured but mostly raw, seasoned with green ants and wild garlic capers.\n\nAdvertisement",

Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong The Herald visited Indi with two architects, Anthony St John Parsons, who won NSW\u2019s house of the year and a national award for interior architecture, and Kate Dickinson, an associate principal with Woods Bagot, as part of its ongoing reviews of apartment life. Consultants BDO estimate the national BTR pipeline includes about 39,300 apartments across 113 projects, worth about $30.1 billion. That represents a growth of 10,000 apartments and nearly $9 billion over the past year.\n\nProfessor Anthony Bourke, the host of Grand Designs and podcast The Home Front, says apartment living can be part of the new Australian dream. \u201cIn fact it will be. It\u2019s whether we can look at rental and apartment living as a desirable alternative to the detached home, and can we shake the idea that it\u2019s just a step-up before getting a \u2018real home\u2019.\u201d Bourke said the challenge was bringing the model within the reach of the average family. Williams\u2019 69-square-metre one-bedroom unit with a balcony rents for $1100 a week. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as rent, I am paying for a lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cI would rather pay more because I don\u2019t have to pay for gym, I have beautiful facilities, I don\u2019t have to leave \u2026 I can go for lunch or have a drink on the rooftop where you are looking out across the harbour.\u201d In most high-end apartment blocks, where units are privately owned, the rooftop space would be given over to penthouses. But at Indi, it is a shared space for tenants with a rooftop dining area, a chef\u2019s kitchen, and outdoor space.\n\nBates Smart managing director, architect Philip Vivian, said Indi was sustainable. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to compare it to 234 homes in the suburbs, basically a full suburb with lawns being watered and two cars in every garage \u2026 or 234 eco huts all accessed by cars versus far more sustainable zero cars, low-carbon transport.\u201d Architect Anthony St John Parsons, Indi operations director Courtney Raven, Woods Bagot associate principal Kate Dickinson and Bates Smart managing director Philip Vivian.

The structural columns that span the 25-metre pool were unadorned. The developers wanted to cover the concrete in the hallways too. But, Vivian said, \u201cWherever we can expose the structure, we left it.\u201d It is part of the building\u2019s beauty and charm, residents said.\n\nIn countries such as France, build-to-rent is a lifetime option and many landlords will not offer leases shorter than five years. Like Investa, the manager and developer of Indi, landlords are usually long-term institutional investors. Loading Housing experts AHURI warn BTR needs to be regulated. Ownership of too many units by one owner creates a risk to tenants and the community if the business owner puts up rents excessively or evicts everyone at the same time to refurbish/redevelop buildings. On the upside, the blocks are likely to be built to a better standard because building owners know they will be responsible for the maintenance for longer. Dr Chris Martin of UNSW\u2019s City Futures Research Centre warns of the dark side, and describes many of the advantages as plausible.\n\n\u201cIt says something about the uncertainty and turnover in the way the rental housing system currently is structured that the prospect of a mega-corporate landlord has been embraced as such a good thing.\u201d \u2018It says something about the uncertainty and turnover in the way the rental housing system currently is structured that the prospect of a mega-corporate landlord has been embraced as such a good thing.\u2019 Chris Martin Martin, a former NSW Tenants Union head, says half of landlords turn over within five years of entering the Sydney and Melbourne market. \u201cIn Australia, BTR has been very plausibly presented as an enhancement to the security that people have, but there have also been international experiences where the rise of large corporate landlords has been detrimental to housing.\u201d He said the growth of build-to-rent in the US and Europe has resulted in big corporate landlords abusing their power.\n\n\u201cMany bought en masse distressed properties, single-family detached dwellings \u2026 And the evidence is that they move to evict tenants more readily than smaller holding landlords.\u201d Loading Compared with her experience renting other properties, Williams said she hoped corporate landlords would be held to a higher standard, and so far had no problems. Atkinson said it was nice to know the BTR product was providing bang for buck. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d meet someone on the rooftop, and grow old together! \u201cThe great Aussie dream historically has been the aspiration, but I think as the population changes and diversifies, so does any one person\u2019s aspiration.\u201d\n\nFor example, a tenant may want to spend more on travel, knowing their home is secure, without the distraction of interest rates. Residents at Indi. Credit: Felix Mooneram The common spaces are generous. \u201cFor BTR this is an interesting space as they are sacrificing tangible NLA [net lettable area]/rent for non-rentable area.\u201d St John Parsons said Indi\u2019s architecture was amazing. \u201cAs a building, it is bloody beautiful.\u201d And he was impressed by how it dealt with \u201ca really tricky dynamic underneath, the metro\u201d.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In the medical trade, it has the impressively apocalyptic (if somewhat gendered) moniker, \u201cThe Widowmaker\u201d, a blockage of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) that is most emphatically not a good thing if yours is the heart to which it happens to be attached. Stay with me here as I get a bit technical: the matey-sounding LAD is one of the main routes that supplies your heart with all the vital gubbins needed to keep it beating (blood, oxygen et cetera). And even with my limited scientific background (I come from a medical family, but my eldest brother followed dad into the doctoring lark, letting us other two brothers off the hook), I know a working heart is non-negotiable when it comes to staying alive. If your three-millimetre LAD gets gummed up, the resulting heart attack, according to Dr Google, is most often \u201ccatastrophic\u201d or \u201cmassive\u201d. Survival rates are less than 10 per cent. These are not good odds. Let\u2019s back up a few weeks to a time when I was blissfully unaware of the LAD in my chest quietly helping my heart beat some 100,000 times a day. After several months of feeling a \u201cbit off\u201d, which I put down to the lingering effects of enforced idleness due to a fractured ankle, I finally dragged myself to my GP. It had taken quite a while but avoiding deadlines until the very last minute is a way of life for most journalists. Sometimes, I don\u2019t even get around to procrastinating. The other motivating factor was that we were very shortly due to fly to Spain on a much-anticipated family holiday. I just needed reassurance that all was tickety boo with my ticker and that my planned cerveza and paella tour was not in danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe good doctor took one look (actually, several looks and a detailed case history) and packed me off to the first cardiologist who could fit me in at very short notice. He took several more looks, gave me one long, very worried look, told me to put away the Spanish guidebooks, and booked a computed tomography angiogram. Loading The procedure involves lying down and being fed into a huge doughnutty thing that makes lots of dramatic banging and whirring noises. A contrast dye is injected via a canula so the doctors can get a good look at what\u2019s going on under the bonnet. I had been warned I might feel like I\u2019d \u2026 er \u2026 lost control of my bodily functions but, even so, suddenly feeling like you\u2019ve filled a nappy in public is strangely disconcerting. As I lay there coming to terms with my new identity as a doubly incontinent 59-year-old with a dicky ticker, the radiologist appeared with a look on his face that implied I probably shouldn\u2019t buy green bananas and definitely not pick up any long books. His advice was to go home, avoid all exertion (which, ironically, is probably what got me into this mess in the first place) and count down the five days until I was booked in for an angioplasty. On the train home, I imagined what my blockage might look like under a microscope. I pictured a micro-sized fatberg made up of sausage rolls, meat pies and chips all gummed together with pate (mmmmm, pate) and soft cheese (mmmmm, soft cheese). When Nick Galvin got the call to go into hospital earlier than expected, he didn\u2019t think twice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019d be a tiny gap left just waiting for a cream bun somewhere in my body to come barrelling up the artery and plug that final hole, at which point my face would turn bright pink and steam would come out of my ears in the style of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The reality, I suspect, would probably not be quite so jolly. I spent the next day or so like a man carrying a Ming vase across a polished floor. Wearing socks. And boxing gloves. Blindfold. After a few beers. You get the picture. Loading The following evening, I got a call from a number I didn\u2019t recognise. Usually, this would be some desperate publicist who thinks the way to get me enthused about their client\u2019s latest book/collaboration/ground-breaking one-woman show about meerkat mating rituals is to call during dinner. However, for whatever reason, I picked up. On the line was the totally wonderful Dr Fiona Foo, one of the nation\u2019s few female interventional cardiologists. She asked if I was busy the following day (nope \u2013 just sitting, trying to keep that vase in one piece). She could make time to operate on my micro-fatberg if I could get myself up to Macquarie University Hospital. Next day, I was at MUH all prepped and ready to go, chatting to the irrepressible doctor, who radiated confidence and competence, both important attributes in someone about to head up an artery on a Fantastic Voyage-style journey to your heart like anyone else might pop out to Coles. In an angiogram, tools are inserted into the artery via a small incision. Foo prefers the radial artery in the wrist but the groin is also prepped as a back-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of which left me lying in a chilly operating theatre, Foo and her team around me, exposed in a manner that in other circumstances would result in a two-year good behaviour bond. But did I care? I did not. That would be the fentanyl they used to take the edge off. It\u2019s a wonderful thing for lowering inhibitions and it made this all feel like the most glorious lark. It really ought to be illegal outside hospitals. Loading Alongside the operating table was a large video screen that allowed Foo to guide the tools to precisely the right spot. What I could see was pretty incomprehensible and quite dull, but I resisted asking for Netflix instead. Over the next 90 minutes or so, the dexterous Foo tamed the micro-fatberg with a tiny balloon and then inserted a stent \u2013 a wire cage \u2013 to hold open the artery. Shortly afterwards, I was wheeled to the Coronary Care Unit, where I spent the night being fussed over by a brilliant crew of nurses. Next morning, despite a sleepless night \u2013 just like on the movies, there are an awful lot of bleeping machines in a CCU, to which nobody pays the slightest bit of notice \u2013 I realise I\u2019m feeling good. In fact, I\u2019m feeling f--king sensational.\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: Getty / Reinhard Dirscherl / ullstein bild The island has experienced 140 per cent growth in the median house price over the past decade, with the average home now sitting at $1.25 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there are less extreme examples. The Central Highlands in Tasmania had a 58 per cent occupancy rate, with a 10-year growth of 157 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Point Nepean and the Lorne-Anglesea regions in Victoria had vacancy rates above 55 per cent, with a 10-year growth of 99.9 per cent and 103.4 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average home in Point Nepean now sits at $1.31 million, while in the Lorne-Anglesea area that figure rises to $1.57 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the NSW south coast, the 15km strip between Callala Bay and Currarong had a 48 per cent vacancy rate \u2014 but a 126.8 per cent 10-year growth rate, with the average home now at $1.15 million.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler Vanessa Rader, Ray White's head of research, said the report revealed Australia\u2019s holiday home phenomenon had a concentrated geography, and these areas challenged fundamental assumptions about property investment returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Using unoccupied housing data as a proxy for holiday home concentration reveals regional markets operating under entirely different economic principles than metropolitan residential investment,\" Rader said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicola Powell, Domain's chief of research and economics, agreed that the locations were united by their lifestyle and holiday home appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n'Classic' coastal or nature-based destinations had surged in recent years as Australians \u201cincreasingly sought lifestyle property\u201d, particularly following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the move to remote and hybrid work, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it permanently boosted demand for homes in scenic and lower-density areas,\" Powell said. \"When you look at these regions, they cater for both second holiday homes, but also short-term letting as well.\"\n\n\n\nPowell said the scarcity of homes available to buy was also keeping property prices high in those areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The limited stock and the high unoccupied proportion of dwellings really feed this,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that surge, a holiday home can seem a straightforward investment for those wealthy enough to make one.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut looks \u2014 even pristine and coastal \u2014 can be deceiving.\n\n\n\nWhat other considerations are there?\n\nRader warned holiday homes can come with \"huge\" holding costs before a buyer has even spent a summer in one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Highly unoccupied regions operate infrastructure designed for seasonal rather than permanent populations. Holiday home owners encounter service connection delays, limited provider options, and higher charges reflecting peak-period capacity constraints,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRader said recent regulatory changes designed to respond to affordability pressures in the housing market could also reduce rental income potential for holiday home investors \u2014 such as Victoria's 7.5 per cent levy on short-stay platforms and councils implementing rates surcharges for Airbnb properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a remote location like Moreton Island, she said building materials and tradespeople required ferry transport, significantly increasing maintenance costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the most significant concern is that many areas with high vacancy rates experienced environmental risks beyond what most traditional residential investments faced \u2014 and thus, higher insurance premiums.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The problem that could cost Australia more than $8 billion every year\n\nRay White's report said properties in coastal areas could often attract insurance premiums 20 to 30 per cent above regional averages. Premiums for Moreton Island, for instance, often run 30 to 40 per cent above mainland alternatives, according to Ray White's analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Premiums] have grown so considerably, and we are a nation that has a lot of these kinds of big natural disaster type events, unfortunately, particularly fires and flooding. It's really built into this kind of new cost to even own these properties,\" Rader said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In order to hold onto these assets, the outlay is far higher than they have been in the past.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell also said Domain's research indicated that Australians priced in considerations like bushfires and riverine flooding when buying a home, with the price impact rising as those risk factors increased.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, she said coastal erosion \u2014 the loss of land along the shoreline due to factors such as rising sea levels \u2014 didn\u2019t appear to have the same impact on price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we found was that buyers prioritise location and views over those long-term risks. For every 10 metres away from the coast, the value of the home declined by 2.6 per cent,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We found that if a property is first in line [to the sea], it adds 20.4 per cent to the home's value, and if there's no road break, it adds another 5.4 per cent. So it really shows Australians prioritise lifestyle over risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell said that anyone looking to buy in one of those locations needed to be careful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're unsure of what the risk is associated with the home that you're looking at, the quickfire way to find out is to get an insurance quote. The premiums really do tell you the risk profile.\"\n\n\n\nIs the bubble bursting?\n\nPowell said there was \"always going to be\" an element of demand for homes in these prime holiday locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether the price growth in these areas is sustainable. In the last year, Glamorgan to Spring Bay in Tasmania experienced a 6.5 per cent annual decrease, with a 0.4 per cent increase in Tasmania's Central Highlands.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile both Lorne-Anglesea and Point Nepean had high 10-year growth, they both had \"modest\" annual growth of 3.8 per cent. Rader says this suggests premium markets are reaching \"natural appreciation limits as affordability constraints restrict buyer expansion\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWith climate change continuing to intensify risks like rising sea levels and extended bushfire seasons, Rader said the long-term viability of homes in these scenic \u2014 but vulnerable \u2014 locations was also increasingly threatened.\n\n\n\nRader made the point, however, that even with a price ceiling, \"if there is a beautiful, lovely, newly built home, [high] prices are still being achieved\".\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes that high residential growth translate to commercial markets? It's unlikely, Rader said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Say you had a suburb with retail shops, if you can't keep your tenants in there because there isn't enough flow-through traffic, or they can only survive three months, six months of the year \u2026 not all businesses can do that,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How viable is that for that business? And then, how viable is that for the landlord that's trying to rent it out? So they're having to take a hit on their terms of their rent to make sure they keep the tenant in there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf rising prices push people out of these areas, those locations will likely swing more and more towards being holiday tourism markets, cyclically driving increasingly higher vacancy rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That market would really just cement itself as being a tourism destination first, more than a residential location. But people do need to live in these places, too,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"If it were more of a trend and the prices were escalating so much, we would find local people would probably move slightly outside of that kind of core location,\" she added. \"The prices in that location would continue to increase, and in turn, the occupancy rate would continue to fall as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRader said that as values rose in what were otherwise quite regional locations, with limited infrastructure because the population couldn't support it, \"there's only so much that you think that those markets can grow in a broader sense\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People aren't there all the time. There's only so many shops that can be there or so many activities that can always be on, or gyms and things that people like to go to, hospitals as well,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you want to go on holiday somewhere, you want to have that kind of holiday experience. But can that holiday experience really be there when half of the year there's no one actually living in these locations?\u201d\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A back stress injury meant Uwland missed this year\u2019s championships after an outstanding bottom-age campaign last year that had him pegged as the best prospect in the 2025 class. The man viewed as Errol Gulden 2.0 did not reach those heights in the limited football he played after recovering, but his football IQ is as good as anyone\u2019s in this draft. He boasts silky skills and can run all day. Might captain the Suns one day. If not: There has been noise for a while, which heated up during the trade period, that the Eagles might bid on Carlton father-son defender Harry Dean. They could also opt to bid on Dylan Patterson or Daniel Annable here. Patterson might be the most damaging and exciting player in this year\u2019s draft. He takes the game on with his kicking and fast feet \u2013 including a nasty goose step \u2013 and sometimes tries to do too much, but showed in a VFL game against Carlton late in the season that he can rein his attacking nature in. Likened to Andrew McLeod, Patterson rejected NRL clubs\u2019 overtures to stay on the AFL path, and could be a difference-maker for the Suns.\n\nIf not: Gold Coast will desperately hope this doesn\u2019t happen because it would cruel their chances of securing their five fancied academy prospects. West Coast might pick Cooper Duff-Tytler instead, or bid on Dean or Annable. The Eagles have long been linked to Duff-Tytler, a talented ex-basketballer who boasts similar traits to AFL ruck stars Luke Jackson and Tom De Koning with his athleticism, leap, agility and follow-up work. He showed in a VFL appearance for Essendon, where he played predominantly as a forward, that he can impact the game in attack as well, even if that remains a query in some quarters. Should develop rapidly in an AFL environment. If not: Some recruiters think the Eagles would at least consider Sullivan Robey. There is also a chance Richmond are already picking here, and they could snap up Robey before placing bids.\n\nRobey is this year\u2019s bolter, after many clubs hoped they could keep him a secret once he graduated from Rowville\u2019s senior side to belatedly burst onto the scene for the Ranges mid-season. He grew about 17 centimetres in the past two years and developed physically, in equal parts owing to an impressive home gym and his dedication. First made his mark as a lead-up forward, then showed his strength and power as a midfielder. If not: The Tigers might start bidding first. They are also linked to Xavier Taylor and Sam Grlj. The Lions\u2019 premiership window will never shut if kids like Annable keep popping up, after the Ashcroft brothers arrived in recent years. Annable racks up disposals, excels at stoppages and is creative by hand. There are all sorts of flattering comparisons ahead of the draft each year, and recruiters see a bit of Simon Black in Annable. Brisbane will gleefully match any bid on Annable, and would quietly be chuffed if it comes this late. If not: The Tigers either stopped bidding and selected Taylor or Grlj, or bid on Dean instead.\n\nThis would be ideal for the Blues, given Dean is widely rated as a top-five talent. A bid here would also not wipe out both their first-round picks. Dean is one of the best key defender prospects in years, and stands out because there is a major shortage of that position in this crop. He aggressively flies for marks and spoils, reads the ball superbly, and has the athleticism and composure to thrive at the top level. If not: A Dean bid has already come and gone, and the Tigers are bidding on someone else. It would be a shock if Dean did not receive a bid by this pick.\n\nTaylor once polarised because of inconsistent decision-making and execution, including a habit for kicking into the man on the mark \u2013 but he has cleaned that up (mostly), and risen sharply on draft boards. Was best afield in the Ranges\u2019 grand final triumph, where his intercepting skills, athleticism, versatility and competitiveness were on show. Importantly, there is confidence Taylor will stand up defensively in the AFL. If not: The Tigers went for Sam Grlj\u2019s combination of blazing speed, endurance and athleticism. The Bombers could shape the draft with their back-to-back picks. The suspicion is they will invest in midfielders after parting with Dylan Shiel, Will Setterfield and Ben Hobbs, on top of the Zach Merrett situation, Darcy Parish\u2019s injury history, and with Elijah Tsatas still proving himself. Sharp won the Larke Medal as the best-performed player at the championships, and is a physical, competitive onballer who wins the ball in big doses. If not: Essendon have also been linked to Sam Cumming, Jacob Farrow and forward-ruck Aidan Schubert.\n\nA shoulder injury cut Cumming\u2019s season short, but not before he stamped himself as a potential top-10 selection. He is a dual-position threat who can impact the game as a deep forward with his marking ability and knack for kicking goals, or as a midfielder, where his physicality, aggression and dynamism are all ticks. There have even been Mark Ricciuto comparisons. Recruiters also like Cumming\u2019s defensive commitment. If not: The Bombers might instead opt for Farrow, who some believe has more upside and would likely start at half-back before eventually moving into the midfield. The Demons are never afraid to go against the grain. This is higher than Nairn has been projected, but Melbourne have him in their sights. Nairn had a seven-goal game at the championships before demonstrating his ball-winning wares with consecutive 30-plus-disposal outings to end the season. He is a high IQ footballer, can run all day as a wingman, could develop into an inside midfielder, marks well overhead and is a neat kick.\n\nIf not: They would love Sam Cumming to still be on the board, and might select small forward Lachy Dovaston, defender Jacob Farrow or try to fortify their key defensive posts for the future with Blake Thredgold. Dovaston, who hails from the same Talent League club as Nick Watson, is the best small forward in this draft. He might lack Watson\u2019s tricks, but still has his share, and has greater running capacity and is considered superior defensively to when the star Hawk was the same age. Dovaston kicks goals for fun (and lots of them), is consistent, has become more selfless, runs hard up and down the ground, and tested brilliantly at the combine. If not: Farrow would give the Demons another kicking weapon across half-back, and could become a midfielder in time. Thredgold would also make sense with Steven May nearing the end of his career, while they could pair Latrelle Pickett with his cousin Kysaiah.\n\nLittle is known across the league about the Hawks\u2019 plans, but Farrow would be a good get. His draft range starts at Essendon\u2019s picks, and he has admirers into the mid-teens. Farrow is one of the best kicks in this class, makes quick decisions, impacts the game as an interceptor, and showed his agility in combine testing. He has also performed well in the midfield, but is more proven down back, where he will start and possibly stay in the AFL. If not: The Hawks might go for Sam Grlj\u2019s mix of speed and endurance, or they could look to bolster their forward line with one of Mitch Marsh, Aidan Schubert or Archie Ludowyke. The Blues might lose this pick, depending on where a Harry Dean bid comes. They would love Lachy Dovaston to still be available, but Grlj has speed to burn and was one of only two players to run the two-kilometre time trial quicker than six minutes at the combine. He entered top-five calculations with a superb start to the year before hitting a rough patch, but his VFL form for Richmond was excellent. Grlj could eventually become a midfielder. If not: Carlton might continue their small forward pursuit and pick Latrelle Pickett, or could be in the market for a defender such as Oskar Taylor or Josh Lindsay, who bring different strengths.\n\n15. Oskar Taylor (GWS) South Belgrave/Eastern Ranges\n\nDefender, 183cm, 2/5/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 20.5 disposals, 3.2 rebound 50s, 5.1 intercept possessions It is dangerous to predict what the Giants might do, but Taylor seems a good fit. His stocks increased the longer the year went after not playing at the championships, capped by his eye-catching results at the combine, where he set the fastest 20-metre sprint time and finished second for agility. Taylor puts that acceleration to great use to quickly create separation and get the ball moving forward. He can tidy up his kicking and improve defensively. If not: The Giants have also been linked to Latrelle Pickett, while Grlj would be in contention if he were available. Others mentioned were Archie Ludowyke and West Coast next-generation academy forward Tylah Williams. 16. Latrelle Pickett (West Coast)\n\nTumby Bay/Glenelg\n\nForward, 182cm, 28/12/2005\n\nSANFL reserves stats (avg): 11.9 disposals, 4.9 score involvements, 1.8 goals Melbourne star Kysaiah Pickett\u2019s cousin has top-20 interest in what is an even crop, but there is a chance he is still up for grabs in the 20s. Pickett turns 20 in December, so he is slightly older than his draft peers, but has impressed this year with his progress at Glenelg. The Eagles are among the clubs that have kept a close eye on Pickett, who is quick, elusive, capable of the mercurial, and has the cheek that the best small forwards possess. If not: The Eagles might opt for the safer option of sweet-kicking defender Josh Lindsay, or could grab a forward such as Aidan Schubert, Mitch Marsh or Archie Ludowyke. 17. Josh Lindsay (Western Bulldogs) Newtown & Chilwell/Geelong Falcons/Victoria Country\n\nDefender/midfielder, 183cm, 7/4/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 20.5 disposals, 7 contested possessions, 3.7 intercept possessions\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 22.3 disposals, 4.8 intercept possessions, 444 metres gained\n\n2025 All-Australian\n\nLindsay is an excellent decision-maker and arguably the best kick in the draft \u2013 the result of years of dedication honing his skills, including a strict morning routine \u2013 so this would be a good result for the Bulldogs. He has been a consistently high performer at all levels, and is viewed as a safe selection who could slot straight into a defensive role. There are varying opinions on whether Lindsay could develop into a midfielder. Josh Lindsay won the best on ground medal playing for the Australia under-18a against Coburg VFL in April. Credit: via Getty Images If not: The Dogs have a key defensive need, so they could go for Thredgold, who is comfortably the best tall backman still available. 18. Blake Thredgold (Adelaide) Payneham Norwood Union/Sturt/South Australia\n\nDefender, 194cm, 27/8/2007\n\nSANFL U18 stats (avg): 11.6 disposals, 5.4 marks, 2 intercept marks\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 13 disposals, 5 marks, 1 intercept mark\n\nRecruiters took notice of Thredgold\u2019s solid job last year as a bottom-ager on future Collingwood forward Charlie West. He also quelled fellow first-round prospect Mitch Marsh in this year\u2019s SANFL under-18 grand final and dominated in the air to cap a strong finals series. Thredgold is on North Melbourne\u2019s radar, but the Crows might get in first. He is a tad undersized but a genuine lockdown defender who is strong, athletic and competitive. If not: There are lots of South Australian options, if the Crows want to go down that path. Marsh, Aidan Schubert, Jevan Phillipou and Harley Barker would all be viable options. 19. Archie Ludowyke (Geelong) East Sandringham/Sandringham Dragons/Victoria Metro\n\nForward, 197cm, 19/11/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 9.3 disposals, 3.3 F50 marks, 3.3 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 4 disposals, 1 mark, 1.7 score involvements Ludowyke started the year brightly for the Dragons and the AFL Academy after long being rated the best key forward in this class. However, he had a goalless championships \u2013 which was not all his fault, as a player relying on service \u2013 before suffering a season-ending PCL injury in Metro\u2019s win over the Allies. This would be a classic Cats play to invest in a player with good size and athleticism who launches himself at the Sherrin.\n\nLoading If not: Geelong regularly, and successfully, ignore the status quo in the draft. Mitch Marsh, Aidan Schubert, Louis Emmett and Harley Barker might be in play. Or could they bid on Jai Murray (Gold Coast) or Tylah Williams (West Coast)? 20. Mitch Marsh (Fremantle) Kangarilla/West Adelaide/South Australia\n\nForward, 190cm, 15/2/2007\n\nSANFL U18 stats (avg): 12.5 disposals, 6.1 marks, 2 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 8.5 disposals, 6 marks, 3 goals\n\n2025 All-Australian The Dockers gleefully drafted 2025 Rising Star winner Murphy Reid at around this pick last year, and could unearth another bargain in Marsh, who kicked the most goals at the 2025 championships. He emerged from the carnival as a top-10 contender who some thought could play other positions, but appears to have slid after a so-so end to the season. But the talent and upside are there, and Marsh could add to a talented Freo forward line.\n\nIf not: The Dockers could place a bid on West Coast next-generation academy forward Tylah Williams, or might punt on upside with one of All-Australian winger Harley Barker or talented forward Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves. 21. Aidan Schubert (Essendon) Gawler Central/Central District/South Australia\n\nForward/ruckman, 196cm, 21/12/2007\n\nSANFL U18s stats (avg): 19.2 disposals, 4.4 clearances, 2.2 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 17 disposals, 3.3 F50 marks, 2.5 goals\n\n2025 All-Australian The Bombers might snap up Schubert with one of their first two picks, so would probably be delighted if he is still up for grabs here. His awkward ball drop and kicking style are talking points, and put some clubs off, while he measured shorter than some scouts expected. But Schubert had an outstanding championships to surge into the top-10 mix. Talls can sometimes drift, given the risks involved, but his competitiveness and endurance appeal. If not: There are interesting names still available, so Essendon may continue the midfield theme with Oliver Greeves, add more talent to their front end with Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves, or go for ACL-recovering winger Harley Barker.\n\nLoading 22. Oliver Greeves (Hawthorn) Vermont/Eastern Ranges/Victoria Metro\n\nMidfielder, 191cm, 7/2/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 25.5 disposals, 9.8 contested possessions, 1.1 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 25 disposals, 11.8 contested possessions, 4.5 clearances\n\n2025 All-Australian Greeves is linked to the Hawks by virtue of their rejected application to include him in their next-generation academy program because of his Indigenous background. He also trained with them during the pre-season through the AFL Academy. Greeves is polarising \u2013 with most queries centred on his running ability \u2013 but a contested beast who has the height and ability to also impact the game when he plays as a marking forward. If not: Hawthorn did a great job rebuilding their list in the draft, and in trade and free agency, so there are not many holes. They can probably afford to take a risk on Harley Barker, or show patience with someone such as Louis Emmett.\n\nSecond round 23. Louis Emmett (North Melbourne) Glen Iris/Oakleigh Chargers/Victoria Metro\n\nRuckman/forward, 199cm, 23/3/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 15.3 disposals, 9.3 contested possessions, 1.1 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 12.7 disposals, 4.3 marks, 2 clearances There is talk the Kangaroos might trade for Gold Coast\u2019s pick 18 (before it is absorbed in matching bids), but it is unclear if that move is directly related to trying to select key defender Blake Thredgold. The popular view on Emmett, who finished third in the time trial at the combine, is that he will need to develop into a key-position player at either end \u2013 but there is upside here. His draft range starts far earlier than this and could be wider. If not: Could the Roos bid on some of the glut of players in this part of the draft, such as Sydney\u2019s Max King, Harry Kyle and Lachy Carmichael, Essendon\u2019s Adam Sweid, Gold Coast\u2019s Jai Murray and Beau Addinsall, Carlton\u2019s Jack Ison or Collingwood\u2019s Zac McCarthy?\n\n24. Harry Kyle (Sydney match North Melbourne bid) UNSW-Eastern Suburbs Bulldogs/Sydney Academy/Allies\n\nDefender/midfielder, 188cm, 16/7/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 20.8 disposals, 9.3 contested possessions, 1.1 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 12.5 disposals, 10.3 uncontested possessions, 1.3 intercept possessions As always with bids, particularly in this region of the draft, there is a great unknown, but recruiters think this is roughly where Kyle might bob up. The Swans academy product finished top 10 in three tests at the combine, including winning the running vertical jump. Part of Kyle\u2019s appeal is that this was his first year in the academy, so there is serious scope for improvement. He is a good size, has a big tank and brings positional versatility. If not: The Kangaroos might bid on someone else, or not at all. They previously drafted Brayden George off an ACL, so they may be wary to do so again with Harley Barker, but the South Australian could reap great rewards. Other options might be Jevan Phillipou or Riley Onley. 25. Jevan Phillipou (North Melbourne)\n\nLoading PHOS Camden/Woodville-West Torrens/South Australia\n\nMidfielder/forward, 183cm, 30/3/2007\n\nSANFL U18 stats (avg): 22.7 disposals, 9.7 contested possessions, 4.9 clearances Just like his St Kilda-listed brother Mattaes, Phillipou made an impression with his supreme confidence in club interviews. Injury sidelined him from the championships, and at different stages of his junior career, but there is plenty to like, including how self-driven and talented he is. The ex-decathlete is a good athlete, and brings the speed and dynamism that clubs want. Some recruiters rate him in the teens, so don\u2019t be surprised if he is long gone. If not: The Roos could go for someone else in this range, such as Harley Barker or Riley Onley, but rival recruiters don\u2019t expect them to go for Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves, given his similarities to Zane Duursma. 26. Harley Barker (Essendon)\n\nMount Barker/Sturt/South Australia\n\nWingman, 188cm, 2/5/2007\n\nSANFL U18 stats (avg): 16.8 disposals, 6.8 marks, 3.2 clearances\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 16 disposals, 3.3 inside 50s, 5.8 score involvements\n\n2025 All-Australian There is risk with Barker, who sustained an ACL rupture playing for Sturt after earning All-Australian honours. If a club is willing to take that on board, there is so much to like about Barker\u2019s prospects, given he was considered a top-10 smokey after his championships performance. His size, speed, endurance and skill add up to an impressive package, and he uses his running ability to get involved at both ends. There is a chance he slides. If not: The Dons might bid on a player instead, but might not want to tempt fate on their academy players Adam Sweid and Hussien El Achkar. Other options include Riley Onley, Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves and Sam Swadling. 27. Jack Ison (Carlton match Essendon bid) Parkside/Oakleigh Chargers/Victoria Metro\n\nMidfielder/forward, 191cm, 26/3/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 20.5 disposals, 4.5 clearances, 4.5 tackles\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 13.3 disposals, 4.7 score involvements, 3.7 tackles\n\nLoading Injuries impacted the start of Ison\u2019s season, but the Blues\u2019 next-generation academy prospect finished strongly \u2013 and opposition recruiters took notice. Ison\u2019s height and aerial prowess make him a candidate to fill various roles across the ground, beyond just the midfield. There is still a smallish sample size on him, but the scouting report acknowledges that he can do things others in this range cannot, so Carlton will gleefully match a bid. If not: There are a heap of other players in this part of the draft who are connected to clubs, and clubs will likely start bidding upon them somewhere here. 28. Max King (Sydney match Essendon bid) Cardiff Hawks/Sydney Swans Academy/Allies\n\nForward/midfielder, 191cm, 1/9/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 14 disposals, 3.8 marks, 2.3 tackles\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 7.3 disposals, 2.7 marks, 0.7 goals\n\nCould the Bombers make a double bid? There is probably not a better athlete in this draft, and he blew everyone away with his 80-centimetre vertical jump at the combine. King took some breathtaking grabs throughout the season, and his individual highlights and potential are why he was once viewed as a top-10 contender \u2013 and why a bid could come in the teens. The challenge in rating him is whether his football IQ will catch up to his athleticism. If not: As above, there are many other bidding candidates, or players such as Riley Onley, Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves and Sam Swadling likely come into calculations. 29. Noah Hibbins-Hargreaves (Essendon) Mornington/Dandenong Stingrays/Victoria Country\n\nForward, 186cm, 16/11/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 16.3 disposals, 1.9 F50 marks, 1.5 goals\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 12 disposals, 8.8 uncontested possessions, 1.5 goals The glimpses are incredibly exciting when it comes to Hibbins-Hargreaves, who produced some enormous performances in his draft season, including several bags of goals. He is best suited as a forward, where his class and skill come to the fore. That said, there are concerns about Hibbins-Hargreaves\u2019 inconsistency and contest work at ground level. Some recruiters would not consider him here, but others might jump earlier than this.\n\nIf not: Could the Bombers pick their own academy product, Adam Sweid, here instead? Rival recruiters have asked that question. 30. Lachy Carmichael (Sydney match Western Bulldogs bid)\n\nSydney Swans Academy/North Shore Bombers/Allies\n\nDefender, 183cm, 27/8/2007\n\nTalent League U18 stats (avg): 27 disposals, 7.7 contested possessions, 5.7 intercept possessions\n\nU18 champs stats (avg): 24.8 disposals, 4.8 rebound 50s, 6 score involvements\n\n2025 All-Australian Will the Swans match a third academy player in the top 30? In a draft where many prospects are flawed or erratic, Carmichael\u2019s ultra-consistency across several years is a big tick. He was an All-Australian at under-16 level in 2023, and earned that same honour at this year\u2019s under-18 championships, where he was also the Allies\u2019 MVP. Carmichael is defensively sound, but his kicking and relative lack of athleticism keep him in this range. If not: Sydney may not match a Carmichael bid if it comes so soon after ones on Harry Kyle and Max King, but it will be interesting to see. The Dogs could also bid on any number of other club-tied prospects, including Gold Coast pair Jai Murray and Beau Addinsall.",

    "text": "\u201cOne way to let your wrist alleviate stress away is by practicing some twist movement, and I\u2019m feeling better already,\u201d Sungkar wrote in one post flashing a Rolex Datejust Wimbledon in a video that appears to have been filmed while he was working in NAB\u2019s business centre. Loading In another, Sungkar proudly poses inside a Tokyo branch of the pre-owned luxury watch retailer Okura with a Hublot watch worth up to $30,000. In other posts, Sungkar proudly displays an Audemars Piguet worth up to $35,000. Addressing the growing scandal for the first time, NAB chief executive Andrew Irvine on Thursday told the this masthead: \u201cInsider fraud is always difficult, we\u2019ve got zero tolerance for it, and you can be sure that we\u2019re looking at all of our processes and controls to make sure that those are strengthened as we go forward.\u201d Sungkar has been sacked by the bank, having initially been stood down pending the outcome of internal and police investigations.\n\nSungkar had worked for the bank since 2008, when he was employed in a customer advisory role, and was promoted to a senior position in October 2018 when he returned from an 18-month stint working as a mortgage broker. He was promoted to his position, in which he dealt directly with mortgage brokers who provided him with documents for loan applications, in August 2022. Several other NAB employees are under investigation for allegedly facilitating home and business loans for the syndicate under the direction of the Penthouse Syndicate\u2019s alleged ringleader, Shanghai-born 38-year-old Bing \u201cMichael\u201d Li. Those employees have not been charged, but have been stood down from their positions pending the outcome of an internal investigation and detectives\u2019 probe into the employees\u2019 alleged involvement with the syndicate. No NAB customers have been targeted in the alleged fraud. Detectives have arrested 16 syndicate members since Strike Force Myddleton was formed last January to investigate a $10 million fraud scheme involving the purchase of non-existent luxury cars in Sydney\u2019s west.\n\n\u201cI said that we\u2019d be coming for them, and we\u2019ve started,\u201d Detective Superintendent Gordon Arbinja, commander of the financial crimes squad, told this masthead. \u201cAnd this person won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Detective Superintendent Gordon Arbinja, commander of the financial crimes squad, said further arrests linked to the Penthouse Syndicate are expected. Credit: Janie Barrett In what was a major catalyst for the Penthouse Syndicate\u2019s spectacular downfall, Li was arrested in July in the $18 million penthouse of the Crown\u2019s residential tower at Barangaroo, from where police say he directed the syndicate. Detectives believe the syndicate has defrauded several of the major banks and other financiers of more than $250 million dating back at least seven years. Li\u2019s arrest and the subsequent investigation into the NAB employees has brought police scrutiny to professionals working on the outskirts of the finance industry, including corrupt solicitors, mortgage brokers and real estate agents who police say form a network of facilitators that helped the syndicate build its multimillion-dollar property portfolio.\n\n\u201cAt every single point of the transaction, there\u2019s trust. Whether it\u2019s a banker, whether it\u2019s a solicitor, a conveyancer, a valuer \u2013 there\u2019s always an element of trust that the bank relies upon \u2013 and every single time, that trust has been violated,\u201d Arbinja said. Li, who remains in custody after several failed bail applications, has been charged with more than 80 offences related to $12.9 million worth of fraud linked to the luxury car scheme and other frauds, but police allege he was heavily involved in orchestrating a large portion of the alleged NAB fraud and has, through mules hired by the syndicate, bought several properties in the past two years. Detectives allege Li has orchestrated the laundering of millions of dollars through the purchase of property and other assets. The Penthouse Syndicate\u2019s alleged ringleader, Bing \u201cMichael\u201d Li, was arrested in the penthouse of the Crown\u2019s residential tower in July. Other NAB employees at several locations across Sydney are suspected of receiving bribes from the syndicate to approve home and business loan applications, which police allege they knew were submitted with fraudulent documents including company records, tax returns and financial statements. The syndicate\u2019s alleged infiltration of the finance giant raises questions about what anti-corruption measures were in place at the bank, which became aware of the alleged fraud and its scale only through the police investigation.\n\nIn July, NAB finalised an enforceable undertaking with the federal government\u2019s anti-money laundering and financial crimes watchdog, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Loading In exchange for being spared a multimillion-dollar fine, NAB agreed to improve its compliance with anti-money laundering laws and counter-terrorism financing laws. Despite the scrutiny on the bank\u2019s fraud and money-laundering controls, most of the Penthouse Syndicate\u2019s alleged defrauding of NAB was carried out while the undertaking was in place. Sungkar was allegedly paid $17,000 to facilitate fraudulent business loans worth millions of dollars for \u201cshell\u201d companies purchased by the syndicate. Sungkar was allegedly paid through transfers made to his now-estranged wife\u2019s bank account by Li.\n\nPenthouse Syndicate members have purchased several of the companies, which typically have a minimum of two years\u2019 trading history, for between $5000 and $10,000. Police allege the syndicate has used fraudulent financial documents linked to the companies to inflate members\u2019 income, allowing them to secure multimillion-dollar mortgage and business loans. Sungkar is alleged to have approved fraudulent business loans worth millions for several shell companies linked to syndicate members Hanna Karliana and her partner, Indra Hari Nurkianto. Karliana, 61, and Nurkianto, 60, were in August charged with a number of offences over their alleged roles in the Penthouse Syndicate. Police allege Sungkar facilitated fraudulent business loans for syndicate members Hanna Karliana and Indra Hari Nurkianto. Credit: Instagram Police allege the couple bought $15 million worth of property \u2013 two CBD apartments and a Bellevue Hill townhouse \u2013 on behalf of the syndicate using fraudulent documents. Sungkar is accused of facilitating millions of dollars worth of business loans for shell companies of which Karliana and Nurkianto were directors. \u201cThis person, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is the gatekeeper of funds,\u201d Arbinja said.\n\n\u201cWtihout this person, the fraud cannot be facilitated. So he\u2019s in a position of trust. He violated that trust, and now, we know that over $200 million in funds have been attributed to this organised crime syndicate.\u201d Loading Chris Sheehan, head of NAB\u2019s group investigations and fraud business unit, said the bank had \u201czero tolerance for employees who engage in criminal conduct\u201d. \u201cThere is absolutely no place for financial crime in our community and we recognise the important role we play in the monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity, working closely with police as well as regulators and government agencies as necessary,\u201d Sheehan said. Sheehan said NAB was working with police and providing \u201csignificant support to aid the investigation and attempted recovery of any funds lost to criminal activity\u201d.\n\nArbinja said NAB had co-operated with the police investigation since it became aware of the alleged fraud. \u201cThese types of syndicates can only be investigated thoroughly with the proper cooperation of our banking partners. It can\u2019t be done solely with police,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot get to this day without the bank\u2019s assistance.\u201d Beyond NAB, detectives are investigating the syndicate\u2019s suspected infiltration of the country\u2019s other major banks, which the group is believed to have defrauded. The NSW Crime Commission has seized $60 million worth of property, cars and luxury goods linked to Li, his partner, Zhouyao \u201cYumi\u201d Chen and other syndicate members.\n\nChen, 37, has been charged with several offences related both to the luxury car scheme, and more than $4 million worth of allegedly fraudulent NAB mortgage and business loans. Karliana and Nurkianto\u2019s daughter-in-law, Thi Ngo Hao Vu, 35, has been charged with a number of offences related to $3.2 million worth of allegedly fraudulent mortgage and business loans. According to court documents, another senior NAB banking manager allegedly approved a $2 million mortgage application and a business loan worth almost $500,000 after advising Li, Vu and her husband, Ibnu Pratama, which documents would be needed to secure the loan. The mortgage was used to purchase Bondi Junction beauty salon Beauty Pavilion. Pratama left Australia in December 2023, a week after detectives raided the home of one of his, Li and Vu\u2019s Beauty Pavilion business partners. He has not returned to the country. A warrant for his arrest was issued in September.",

    "text": "But as the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s head of Australian economics Belinda Allen noted, there might not be any further rate cuts. \u201cWe expect it would take a material move higher in the unemployment rate, together with more moderate inflation prints, to bring the RBA back to the cutting table,\u201d she said. Something not in Chau\u2019s question, or remarked upon by Bullock itself, is how the economy and Australian consumers are performing with the cash rate at 3.6 per cent. Every major lender has reported in recent weeks that delinquency rates - the proportion of people behind on their mortgages - is actually falling (from barely elevated levels). Household consumption has lifted, both in quantity and value. The private sector is, as the RBA noted, starting to take over from the public sector.\n\nThere is real financial pain in parts of the community while unemployment has ticked up. Foodbank this week reported that half of all renters are suffering some form of \u201cfood insecurity\u201d which means they are trying everything from reducing the quality and variety of food to skipping meals. Foodbank Queensland volunteers at the food distribution warehouse in Brisbane. Demand for its services remains at very high levels. Credit: @foodbankqld The Reserve\u2019s own liaison program with charities is finding that demand for services continues to exceed supply, with the biggest pressure points \u201chomelessness, emergency financial and food support and domestic violence\u201d. What\u2019s been surprising, however, has been the lack of widespread and demonstrable financial damage across the nation\u2019s army of borrowers who have borne the brunt of the RBA\u2019s actions.\n\nAfter the Reserve started lifting the cash rate from its 0.1 per cent pandemic-era low, there were real fears for the huge proportion of mortgage holders who had taken fixed rate loans. Loading When these loans re-set at much higher rates, the argument ran, Australians en masse would tumble lemming-like off a \u201cmortgage cliff\u201d. That would be on top of all those people with variable rate mortgages who would struggle to survive. But the cliff and economic disaster didn\u2019t eventuate. Research compiled by a group of economists including several from the e61 think tank, released this week, suggests Australians\u2019 use of offset and redraw accounts may be the nation\u2019s economic secret sauce.\n\nWhile annual repayments on variable mortgage lifted by an average $13,800, the economists found the impact on consumer spending was muted. One of the report\u2019s authors, Gianni La Cava, said people used their mortgage offset and redraw facilities, enabling them to maintain their spending. And, as rates came down, most borrowers did not reduce their repayments. They started rebuilding their mortgage-linked savings. This has major repercussions for the Reserve Bank and how it thinks movements in interest rates work and whether 3.6 per cent will actually bring inflation under control. \u201cThe borrower cash flow channel of monetary policy may have weakened in both directions. The resilience that helped households weather higher rates may also dull the stimulus from lower ones,\u201d La Cava said.\n\nReserve Bank data shows even as the share of household income used to pay mortgages hits 10 per cent, the level of excess mortgage repayments has grown. While the bank will never admit it, especially during a heated political battle over the nation\u2019s housing market, there is a concern that ever-lower interest rates will supercharge property prices. In this week\u2019s quarterly monetary policy statement, the bank revealed that for every 10 per cent lift in housing prices, economic growth is 0.7 per cent higher. In dollar terms, that\u2019s an $18.5 billion jump in economic activity. \u201cThe boost to GDP growth also flows through to higher inflation; in particular, we would expect new dwelling inflation to rise sharply as capacity pressures in housing construction increase,\u201d it noted.\n\nThat increase in activity would push up underlying inflation by about 0.25 percentage points. Such a lift would not only kill any prospect of further rate relief, it would put a rate increase on the agenda. The Grattan Institute noted this week in its report advocating major changes to capital city planning rules that the nation\u2019s ratio of house prices to income has soared over the past two decades. Sydney\u2019s median house cost 6.3 times the median household income back in 2001. Now that median house costs around $1.5 million or almost 10 times median household income. Brisbane and Adelaide have seen even larger increases in the income needed to buy a new home while the ratio has almost doubled in Canberra (with a median house value approaching $1 million).\n\nOur higher priced houses require ever larger mortgages which means a larger share of household income now goes towards paying down the home loan. And yet people have managed to get ahead on their mortgages. All but the richest quarter of home borrowers are further ahead in their repayments today than before the pandemic. These issues, on top of all the other economic problems at play domestically and across the world, swirled around the Reserve Bank\u2019s meeting room as it discussed where interest rates may be headed. There was also an elephant in the room - the bank\u2019s past and current inflation performance. The RBA constantly undershot its 2-3 per cent inflation target across the five years leading up to the pandemic. It was one of the reasons the bank went through an independent review.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one. A three-hat chef and a prize-winning architect walk into an abandoned kiosk in a park. They turn it into what may well be the most significant restaurant opening in a decade. The punchline? Neither of them has ever opened one before. Yiaga, meaning \u201cto seek and find\u201d in Woiwurrung, the language of Melbourne\u2019s traditional owners, the Wurundjeri people, is a creative collaboration between Vue de Monde executive chef Hugh Allen and architect John Wardle. The Pavilion Cafe had sat abandoned in the Fitzroy Gardens on the eastern edge of the CBD for close to a decade. After a project five years and many millions of dollars in the making, the redesigned and renovated restaurant opened last month. It\u2019s tempting to slice a tall poppy before it\u2019s even had time to flower, to dismiss this as a restaurant made by (and for) people with money (Yiaga is partially backed by billionaire Singaporean brothers Philip and Robert Ng, who also own the majority share of three-hat fine diner Vue de Monde). And at $295 a head (excluding wine), with just 44 seats, the 12- to 15-course degustation menu \u2013 which rolls on for around three hours \u2013 is not designed for your average Fitzroy Gardens picnicker. Yiaga\u2019s founder and executive chef, Hugh Allen. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen But here\u2019s another way to look at it. The post-2020 hospitality scene has been in a bit of a share-plate slumber, dominated by grand bistros and neighbourhood diners, with the occasional creative jolt to the arm from small, fun, owner-operated restaurants. Safe, comforting, familiar. Now here\u2019s Yiaga: a dining experience that\u2019s sophisticated in pitch, mature in tone and -thoroughly realised. A loving dispatch to the colours, textures and flavours that make up Australia\u2019s changeable environment. Thoughtful, provocative and unfailingly stylish. In a world of designer chefs and the countless restaurants around the planet bearing their names \u2013 Robuchon, Ramsay, Boulud, Nobu \u2013 it\u2019s outliers such as Hugh Allen who bring something new to the table. A reminder that dining out can be more than a meal, it can be an art form. On that front, Australia is no slouch. In Victoria, there\u2019s Dan Hunter\u2019s farm-to-table Brae. In NSW, there\u2019s Daniel Puskas\u2019s progressive, ferment-driven Sixpenny, and Josh Niland\u2019s fish-focused Saint Peter. They all bring the noise when it comes to elite Australian fine-dining. But little of our extraordinary, diverse food scene has managed to hold attention on the world stage. Could Yiaga be the one to finally move the dial? I spent three days at the restaurant as they set up for their first guests to find out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 30-year-old chef is no stranger to excellence. Allen spent three years cooking at Noma, chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019s Copenhagen restaurant that\u2019s widely considered one of the world\u2019s greats, featuring a menu that dances a fine line between naturalist and futurist, executed with 10,000-hour precision. For chefs, working there is the culinary equivalent of training to become a green beret. At just 23, he became executive chef at Vue de Monde on the 55th floor of the Rialto Tower. At 26, he became the youngest chef in four decades to hold three hats. He\u2019s spent the past six years running Vue, which recently retained its three hats at The Age Good Food Guide Awards. Only four restaurants in Victoria currently hold that position. The restaurant is in Melbourne\u2019s Fitzroy Gardens. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen Despite all that, Hugh Allen is not a flashy guy. He has very little time for things that don\u2019t directly feed back into the restaurant he\u2019s invested so much of his heart, soul and money in. His iPhone is so cracked, it\u2019s like looking at a Magic Eye puzzle. His laptop screen, also damaged, has a huge black line through it. He\u2019s been hoping someone will knock it off one of the benches and completely destroy it so he can justify purchasing a new one. All this is thrown into sharp relief against his beautifully appointed new restaurant, where even the dessert spoons were hand-crafted by a silversmith. Besides, the show is not Hugh Allen himself, the show is Yiaga. For instance, it\u2019s unusual to see the self-assured, softly spoken chef at the pass (the divider between the kitchen and the outside world, where traditionally you\u2019d find the person running the show). That\u2019s head chef Michael McAulay\u2019s job. Another Noma alum, the 27-year-old moved from Scotland to Australia initially to work at Vue de Monde, where he was sous chef for two years, before spending the past year working on launching Yiaga with Allen. Together, they\u2019re a study in contrast. McAulay works on his toes, darting and weaving like a matador, holding the front line with a thick Glaswegian brogue. Allen floats with the quiet constancy of a Zen monk, speaking in lilting tones, gliding from one chef station to another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair aren\u2019t the only two Vue transplants. General manager Hugo Simoes and sommelier Dorian Guillon, both longtime members of the Vue team, have also made their way to the garden from the dark, lacquered surrounds of the 55th floor. Allen and Simoes will -continue to split their time between the two. Head chef Michael McAulay in the open kitchen. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen Maybe it\u2019s a generation/age thing, and maybe it\u2019s some of that aforementioned familiarity with his team creating a sense of comfort and calm, but the psychological warfare that would have previously been a hallmark of a kitchen operating at this level doesn\u2019t seem to exist. The impression is of a healthy kitchen culture (one of their hiring rules is a \u201cno dickhead -policy\u201d). Perhaps the idea of beauty only being achieved through -brutality is a concept of the past. If the energy from the 13-strong kitchen team (aged between 20 and 31) is anything to go by, it certainly is here. I ask Allen one afternoon how he deals with his internalised rage \u2013 a trait common in noteworthy chefs working in highly pressurised environments. (Infamous culinary torture artist Marco Pierre White once said, \u201cIf you are not extreme, then people will take shortcuts because they don\u2019t fear you.\u201d) Allen told me he doesn\u2019t have any such torment. And I believe him. He is probably the least angst-riddled chef I\u2019ve ever met. Loading Before guests arrive, front- and back-of-house sit down together for \u201cfamily meal\u201d: a chance for calm before the oncoming adrenal storm. Chefs eat generous plates of roast chicken, rice and roast baby zucchini like they mean business, focused on getting back to their stations as quickly as they can. There\u2019s a sense of urgency and industry in the air \u2013 tonight is the first night they\u2019ve all worked as a team. Allen walks around reminding everyone to get some fresh air and stretch before service. \u201cThey just want to get back to setting up,\u201d says Allen. \u201cEspecially when everything\u2019s new, it\u2019s always quite overwhelming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcAulay tours each station in the kitchen, trying the finishing elements of each dish on the menu. He\u2019s been tasting steadily throughout the day. \u201cA lot\n\nof it is the really fine detail,\u201d says the chef, dropping a teaspoon into a container of fresh water. \u201cNothing gets packed away until it gets tasted by me or Hugh. Thinking about everything again just dials you in. You tasted [the sauce] the first time, but then it\u2019s settled: does it need a tiny bit more salt, is it too intense?\u201d It also allows honest dialogue. Any problems with a dish can be flagged early enough to be fixed, creating a calmer environment for everyone. \u201cThe only reason you would pack something away if it hasn\u2019t been tasted is if something is wrong,\u201d says McAulay. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s really good here. I trust everyone.\u201d In the lead-up to opening, industry chatter was focused on what Allen would bring to the table as a chef outside the confines of Vue de Monde and its 25\u2011year legacy. Could he create something original? Would it be Vue 2.0? Noma in the park? The answer is mostly no, and very slightly yes. The vision, flavour and execution is most definitely Hugh Allen\u2019s. To put a dish through the Yiaga lens, Allen and McAulay asked themselves whether it is \u201cseek and find enough\u201d. It must push boundaries, flavour-wise. \u201cJust because it\u2019s an amazing dish somewhere else doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll make sense here,\u201d says McAulay. The open-plan kitchen flows into the dining space. \u201cI want my staff to really engage with the diners,\u201d says Allen. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen Coral trout, initially served with brassicas, felt too classic and European to the pair. Instead, they kept experimenting until they landed on barbecuing the Far North Queensland fish, pairing it with a cheek of new-season mango and sunrise lime, finally injecting it with the base heat of Mexican chilli oil, a suggestion from 29-year-old chef Eduardo Guasch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a wildness to the composition here, akin to a Turner landscape. A command of balance and restraint, executed with the kind of abandon only people who have learnt the rules can achieve when they decide to break them. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what \u2018here\u2019 feels like ourselves, yet,\u201d says Allen. \u201cWe\u2019re new here as well. But we want the food to be very interesting. We want to really push things.\u201d Corner Inlet squid from Gippsland were so large when they were delivered that they took up an entire kitchen benchtop. The flesh is gently confited and cured in white miso, dressed with desert lime, served in a light citrus broth and finished with the peppery tang of Thai basil. There\u2019s deep harmony in a set coconut cream layered with concentrated coconut water, finished with a lump of caviar, a touch of lime zest and a tiny hint of fresh-pressed macadamia oil. A dish so finely tuned that it dampens and mutes the surrounding sounds of the restaurant, just for a moment. Flavoured oils are used less like an ingredient and more like a perfume: gentle enhancements like Geraldton wax, and those macadamia and chilli oils. \u201cI think dining should be exciting,\u201d says Allen. \u201cFood that\u2019s aromatic. Ingredients you\u2019ve never had before, hopefully. Flavours that you can\u2019t work out. Obviously, with all that it still has to be delicious, but we want it to feel very new and really Aussie.\u201d Coconut cream and caviar: Yiaga\u2019s menu aims to \u201cpush the flavour boundaries\u201d. Credit: Kristoffer Paulsen Kangaroo cutlets are gently cooked through service, starting raw at the top of the open hearth, slowly taking in smoke for flavour, then brought down over the coals, glazed with smoked butter and a concentrated sauce made from all the other parts of the kangaroo, served with maitake mushrooms poached in mushroom stock then grilled and glazed with cured egg yolk. They\u2019re looking farther afield at producers, too, utilising forgotten or under-appreciated ingredients. Slices of 14-year-old retired wagyu cow (which would normally be around four when they meet their fate) are draped over a bite-sized steamed bun. The meat, from producer David Blackmore, is very slightly salt-cured but mostly raw, seasoned with green ants and wild garlic capers.\n\nAdvertisement",

Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong The Herald visited Indi with two architects, Anthony St John Parsons, who won NSW\u2019s house of the year and a national award for interior architecture, and Kate Dickinson, an associate principal with Woods Bagot, as part of its ongoing reviews of apartment life. Consultants BDO estimate the national BTR pipeline includes about 39,300 apartments across 113 projects, worth about $30.1 billion. That represents a growth of 10,000 apartments and nearly $9 billion over the past year.\n\nProfessor Anthony Bourke, the host of Grand Designs and podcast The Home Front, says apartment living can be part of the new Australian dream. \u201cIn fact it will be. It\u2019s whether we can look at rental and apartment living as a desirable alternative to the detached home, and can we shake the idea that it\u2019s just a step-up before getting a \u2018real home\u2019.\u201d Bourke said the challenge was bringing the model within the reach of the average family. Williams\u2019 69-square-metre one-bedroom unit with a balcony rents for $1100 a week. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as rent, I am paying for a lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cI would rather pay more because I don\u2019t have to pay for gym, I have beautiful facilities, I don\u2019t have to leave \u2026 I can go for lunch or have a drink on the rooftop where you are looking out across the harbour.\u201d In most high-end apartment blocks, where units are privately owned, the rooftop space would be given over to penthouses. But at Indi, it is a shared space for tenants with a rooftop dining area, a chef\u2019s kitchen, and outdoor space.\n\nBates Smart managing director, architect Philip Vivian, said Indi was sustainable. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to compare it to 234 homes in the suburbs, basically a full suburb with lawns being watered and two cars in every garage \u2026 or 234 eco huts all accessed by cars versus far more sustainable zero cars, low-carbon transport.\u201d Architect Anthony St John Parsons, Indi operations director Courtney Raven, Woods Bagot associate principal Kate Dickinson and Bates Smart managing director Philip Vivian.

The structural columns that span the 25-metre pool were unadorned. The developers wanted to cover the concrete in the hallways too. But, Vivian said, \u201cWherever we can expose the structure, we left it.\u201d It is part of the building\u2019s beauty and charm, residents said.\n\nIn countries such as France, build-to-rent is a lifetime option and many landlords will not offer leases shorter than five years. Like Investa, the manager and developer of Indi, landlords are usually long-term institutional investors. Loading Housing experts AHURI warn BTR needs to be regulated. Ownership of too many units by one owner creates a risk to tenants and the community if the business owner puts up rents excessively or evicts everyone at the same time to refurbish/redevelop buildings. On the upside, the blocks are likely to be built to a better standard because building owners know they will be responsible for the maintenance for longer. Dr Chris Martin of UNSW\u2019s City Futures Research Centre warns of the dark side, and describes many of the advantages as plausible.\n\n\u201cIt says something about the uncertainty and turnover in the way the rental housing system currently is structured that the prospect of a mega-corporate landlord has been embraced as such a good thing.\u201d \u2018It says something about the uncertainty and turnover in the way the rental housing system currently is structured that the prospect of a mega-corporate landlord has been embraced as such a good thing.\u2019 Chris Martin Martin, a former NSW Tenants Union head, says half of landlords turn over within five years of entering the Sydney and Melbourne market. \u201cIn Australia, BTR has been very plausibly presented as an enhancement to the security that people have, but there have also been international experiences where the rise of large corporate landlords has been detrimental to housing.\u201d He said the growth of build-to-rent in the US and Europe has resulted in big corporate landlords abusing their power.\n\n\u201cMany bought en masse distressed properties, single-family detached dwellings \u2026 And the evidence is that they move to evict tenants more readily than smaller holding landlords.\u201d Loading Compared with her experience renting other properties, Williams said she hoped corporate landlords would be held to a higher standard, and so far had no problems. Atkinson said it was nice to know the BTR product was providing bang for buck. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d meet someone on the rooftop, and grow old together! \u201cThe great Aussie dream historically has been the aspiration, but I think as the population changes and diversifies, so does any one person\u2019s aspiration.\u201d\n\nFor example, a tenant may want to spend more on travel, knowing their home is secure, without the distraction of interest rates. Residents at Indi. Credit: Felix Mooneram The common spaces are generous. \u201cFor BTR this is an interesting space as they are sacrificing tangible NLA [net lettable area]/rent for non-rentable area.\u201d St John Parsons said Indi\u2019s architecture was amazing. \u201cAs a building, it is bloody beautiful.\u201d And he was impressed by how it dealt with \u201ca really tricky dynamic underneath, the metro\u201d.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In the medical trade, it has the impressively apocalyptic (if somewhat gendered) moniker, \u201cThe Widowmaker\u201d, a blockage of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) that is most emphatically not a good thing if yours is the heart to which it happens to be attached. Stay with me here as I get a bit technical: the matey-sounding LAD is one of the main routes that supplies your heart with all the vital gubbins needed to keep it beating (blood, oxygen et cetera). And even with my limited scientific background (I come from a medical family, but my eldest brother followed dad into the doctoring lark, letting us other two brothers off the hook), I know a working heart is non-negotiable when it comes to staying alive. If your three-millimetre LAD gets gummed up, the resulting heart attack, according to Dr Google, is most often \u201ccatastrophic\u201d or \u201cmassive\u201d. Survival rates are less than 10 per cent. These are not good odds. Let\u2019s back up a few weeks to a time when I was blissfully unaware of the LAD in my chest quietly helping my heart beat some 100,000 times a day. After several months of feeling a \u201cbit off\u201d, which I put down to the lingering effects of enforced idleness due to a fractured ankle, I finally dragged myself to my GP. It had taken quite a while but avoiding deadlines until the very last minute is a way of life for most journalists. Sometimes, I don\u2019t even get around to procrastinating. The other motivating factor was that we were very shortly due to fly to Spain on a much-anticipated family holiday. I just needed reassurance that all was tickety boo with my ticker and that my planned cerveza and paella tour was not in danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe good doctor took one look (actually, several looks and a detailed case history) and packed me off to the first cardiologist who could fit me in at very short notice. He took several more looks, gave me one long, very worried look, told me to put away the Spanish guidebooks, and booked a computed tomography angiogram. Loading The procedure involves lying down and being fed into a huge doughnutty thing that makes lots of dramatic banging and whirring noises. A contrast dye is injected via a canula so the doctors can get a good look at what\u2019s going on under the bonnet. I had been warned I might feel like I\u2019d \u2026 er \u2026 lost control of my bodily functions but, even so, suddenly feeling like you\u2019ve filled a nappy in public is strangely disconcerting. As I lay there coming to terms with my new identity as a doubly incontinent 59-year-old with a dicky ticker, the radiologist appeared with a look on his face that implied I probably shouldn\u2019t buy green bananas and definitely not pick up any long books. His advice was to go home, avoid all exertion (which, ironically, is probably what got me into this mess in the first place) and count down the five days until I was booked in for an angioplasty. On the train home, I imagined what my blockage might look like under a microscope. I pictured a micro-sized fatberg made up of sausage rolls, meat pies and chips all gummed together with pate (mmmmm, pate) and soft cheese (mmmmm, soft cheese). When Nick Galvin got the call to go into hospital earlier than expected, he didn\u2019t think twice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019d be a tiny gap left just waiting for a cream bun somewhere in my body to come barrelling up the artery and plug that final hole, at which point my face would turn bright pink and steam would come out of my ears in the style of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The reality, I suspect, would probably not be quite so jolly. I spent the next day or so like a man carrying a Ming vase across a polished floor. Wearing socks. And boxing gloves. Blindfold. After a few beers. You get the picture. Loading The following evening, I got a call from a number I didn\u2019t recognise. Usually, this would be some desperate publicist who thinks the way to get me enthused about their client\u2019s latest book/collaboration/ground-breaking one-woman show about meerkat mating rituals is to call during dinner. However, for whatever reason, I picked up. On the line was the totally wonderful Dr Fiona Foo, one of the nation\u2019s few female interventional cardiologists. She asked if I was busy the following day (nope \u2013 just sitting, trying to keep that vase in one piece). She could make time to operate on my micro-fatberg if I could get myself up to Macquarie University Hospital. Next day, I was at MUH all prepped and ready to go, chatting to the irrepressible doctor, who radiated confidence and competence, both important attributes in someone about to head up an artery on a Fantastic Voyage-style journey to your heart like anyone else might pop out to Coles. In an angiogram, tools are inserted into the artery via a small incision. Foo prefers the radial artery in the wrist but the groin is also prepped as a back-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of which left me lying in a chilly operating theatre, Foo and her team around me, exposed in a manner that in other circumstances would result in a two-year good behaviour bond. But did I care? I did not. That would be the fentanyl they used to take the edge off. It\u2019s a wonderful thing for lowering inhibitions and it made this all feel like the most glorious lark. It really ought to be illegal outside hospitals. Loading Alongside the operating table was a large video screen that allowed Foo to guide the tools to precisely the right spot. What I could see was pretty incomprehensible and quite dull, but I resisted asking for Netflix instead. Over the next 90 minutes or so, the dexterous Foo tamed the micro-fatberg with a tiny balloon and then inserted a stent \u2013 a wire cage \u2013 to hold open the artery. Shortly afterwards, I was wheeled to the Coronary Care Unit, where I spent the night being fussed over by a brilliant crew of nurses. Next morning, despite a sleepless night \u2013 just like on the movies, there are an awful lot of bleeping machines in a CCU, to which nobody pays the slightest bit of notice \u2013 I realise I\u2019m feeling good.
