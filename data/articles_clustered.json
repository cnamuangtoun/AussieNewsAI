    "text": "U\ufeffS trade officials have unveiled plans to impose tariffs of up to 3500 per cent on solar panels from some South-East Asian countries.\n\nIt marks a key step towards wrapping up a year-old trade case in which American manufacturers accused Chinese companies of flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods, CNN reports.\n\nThe case was brought last year by Korea's Hanwha Qcells, Arizona-based First Solar Inc and several smaller producers seeking to protect billions of dollars in investments in US solar manufacturing.\n\nUS manufacturers of solar panels have accused Chinese competitors of flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods. (Chinatopix via AP) (AP)\n\nThe petitioner group, the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, accused big Chinese solar panel makers with factories in Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam of shipping panels priced below their cost of production and of receiving unfair subsidies that make US goods uncompetitive.\n\nFor the tariffs to be finalised, the International Trade Commission must vote in June on whether the industry was materially harmed by the dumped and subsidised imports.\n\nThe tariffs unveiled on Monday vary widely depending on the company and country but are broadly higher than the preliminary duties announced late last year.\n\nCombined dumping and countervailing duties on Jinko Solar products from Malaysia were among the lowest at 41.56 per cent. Rival Trina Solar's products from its operations in Thailand face tariffs of 375.19 per cent.\n\nNeither Jinko nor Trina were immediately available for comment.\n\nThe US solar panel market is worth more than $US10 billion. (AP Photo/File) (AP)\n\nProducts from Cambodia would face duties of more than 3500 per cent because its producers elected not to co-operate with the US probe.\n\n\"These are very strong results,\" said Tim Brightbill, a lawyer for the US manufacturing group.\n\n\"We are confident that they will address the unfair trade practices of the Chinese-owned companies in these four countries, which have been injuring the US solar manufacturing industry for far too long.\"\n\nThe threat of tariffs on countries that supplied more than $US10 billion ($16 billion) of solar products to the US last year, accounting for the vast majority of domestic supplies, has caused a dramatic shift in the global solar trade.",

    "text": "Elon Musk says he will dedicate more time to Tesla starting in May after the company reported a big drop in first-quarter profit, and faces ongoing backlash and protests over his leadership of a federal government jobs-cutting group that has divided the country.\n\nThe Austin, Texas, company said on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT) that quarterly profits fell by 71 per cent to to $US409 million ($642 million), or 12 cents a share. That\u2019s far below analyst estimates.\n\nTesla \u2019s revenue fell 9 per cent to $US19.3 billion in the January through March period, below Wall Street\u2019s forecast.\n\nElon Musk's controversial role inside the White House is being blamed for Tesla's woes. (AP)\n\nThe disappointing results come as the company struggles to sell cars to consumers who are angry over Musk's role in the Trump administration. Musk also has publicly supported far-right politicians in Europe and alienated potential buyers there, too.\n\nSome Tesla investors have complained that Musk has been too distracted by his role at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to effectively run Tesla.\n\n\"This is a big step in the right direction,\" said Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, referring to Musk's time commitment. \"Investors wanted to see him recommit to Tesla.\"\n\nTesla' stock has fallen more than 40 per cent this year but rose more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading.\n\nMorningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said earlier reports of plunging sales that had tanked the stock made the results almost predictable.\n\n\"They're not particularly surprising given that deliveries were down,\" Goldstein said, adding that the company is still generating cash. \"It was good to see positive cash flow.\"\n\nThe company generated $US2.2 billion in operating cash versus $US242 million a year earlier.\n\nThere are concerns inside Tesla about Musk and whether he is equipped to continue leading the company. (Bloomberg)\n\nTesla investors will be listening closely for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.\n\nIts closely watched gross margins, a measure of earnings for each dollar of revenue, fell to 16.3 per cent from 17.4 per cent.\n\nThe company that once dominated EVs is also facing fierce competition for the first time.\n\nEarlier this year, Chinese EV maker BYD announced it had developed an electric battery charging system that can fully power up a vehicle within minutes. And Tesla's European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real alternatives, just as popular opinion in Europe has turned against Musk.\n\nInvestors expect Tesla will be hurt less by the Trump administration's tariffs than most US car companies because it makes most of its US cars domestically. But Tesla won't be completely unscathed. It sources some materials for its vehicles from abroad that will now face import taxes.\n\nTesla warned that tariffs will hit its energy storage business, too.\n\nDemonstrators protest against Elon Musk and Department of Government Efficiency cuts outside a Tesla dealership in Kansas City. (AP)\n\n\"While the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our energy business compared to automotive,\" the company said, \"we are taking actions to stabilise the business in the medium to long-term and focus on maintaining its health.\"\n\nRetaliation from China will also hurt Tesla. The company was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its Model S and Model X. It makes the Model Y and Model 3 for the Chinese market at its factory in Shanghai.\n\nThe company side business of selling \"regulatory credits\" to other car makers that fall short of emission standards boosted results for the quarter.",

His death comes after he appeared in St Peter's Square on Easter Sunday, greeting thousands of worshippers. (Photo by Antonio Masiello/Getty Images) (Getty)\n\nUnder norms approved by Francis last year, the funeral and burial must occur between Friday and Sunday.\n\nIn his final will, Francis confirmed he would be buried at St Mary Major basilica, which is outside the Vatican and home to his favorite icon of the Virgin Mary.\n\nAfter every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus, who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.\n\nFrancis stopped by the basilica on his way home from the Gemelli hospital on March 23, after his 38-day hospital stay, to deliver flowers to be placed before the icon.\n\nHe returned April 12 to pray before the Madonna for the last time.\n\nThe world reacts\n\nBells tolled in chapels, churches and cathedrals around the world and flags flew at half staff in Italy, India, Taiwan and the US after Francis' death was announced by the Vatican camerlengo.\n\nSoccer matches in Italy and Argentina were suspended in honour of the Argentine pope who was a lifelong fan of the San Lorenzo soccer club.\n\nWorld leaders praised Francis for his moral leadership and compassion, while ordinary faithful remembered his simplicity and humanity.\n\nWho are the contenders to be the next pope?

Nigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous country and has around 30 million Catholics, representing about 14 per cent of the total population.\n\nViewing the pope's coffin\n\nThe pope's formal apartments in the Apostolic Palace were sealed on Monday evening, following a centuries-old ritual. Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who as camerlengo had the task of announcing the death and confirming it once the cause was determined, presided over the ritual.\n\nFrancis chose not to live in the palace, though, but in the Domus Santa Marta hotel on the other side of Vatican City. He died there and his body was transferred to the hotel chapel in the lobby, where a private viewing was being held on Tuesday for Vatican officials and members of the pontifical household.\n\nVatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, left, prays in front of the body of Pope Francis laid out in state inside his private chapel at the Vatican, Monday, April 21, 2025. (Vatican Media via AP, HO) (AP)\n\nIn changes made by Francis last year, his body was not placed in three wooden coffins, as it had been for previous popes. Rather, Francis was placed in a simplified wooden coffin with a zinc coffin inside.\n\nOnce in St Peter's, his coffin will not be put on an elevated bier, but will just be be placed simply facing the pews, with the Pasqual candle nearby.\n\nFuneral and burial\n\nThe burial must take place between the fourth and sixth day after his death, meaning a likely date is Saturday or Sunday.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has announced he and first lady Melania Trump plan to attend.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei is also expected.\n\nBarack Obama meeting Pope Francis.

The current dean is Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91. The vice dean is Argentine Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 81.\n\nRe and Farrell, the camerlengo, will have key roles in the coming days as they summon the cardinals and prepare for the conclave to elect Francis' successor.\n\nChoosing the next pope\n\nAfter the funeral, there are nine days of official mourning, known as the \u201cnovendiali\".\n\nDuring this period, cardinals arrive in Rome to participate in meetings before the conclave to elect the next pope.\n\nTo give everyone time to assemble, the conclave must begin 15-20 days after the \u201csede vacante\u201d \u2014 the \u201cvacant See\u201d \u2014 is declared, although it can start sooner if the cardinals agree.\n\nOnce the conclave begins, cardinals vote in secret sessions. After voting sessions, the ballots are burned in a special stove. Black smoke indicates that no pope has been elected, while white smoke indicates that the cardinals have chosen the next head of the Catholic Church.",

He will be missed.''\n\nStackpole's aggressive style also worked well for the shorter form of the game, and he played in the first four one-day international matches ever played, against England in 1971 and 1972.\n\nHe ultimately only played six ODIs in total \u2014 scoring three half-centuries \u2014 before retiring from the game and moving into commentary roles on TV and radio for the ABC, Nine and Seven.\n\nFellow Victorian Merv Hughes wrote on social media that it was \"very sad news\".\n\n\"Stacky was a fantastic cricketer but more so a great bloke,\" he said.\n\n\"And one hell of a cricket coach \u2014 I learnt a hell of a lot from both him and Ian Redpath.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nHe was described as \"a dynamic and influential figure in Australian cricket\" by the sport's national governing body.\n\n\"Keith was one of the great contributors to the game of cricket and his legacy will live long into the future,\" Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird said.\n\n\"Not only was he an outstanding player for Australia and Victoria, his work in the media, radio and TV commentary and as a mentor to many players who followed in his footsteps demonstrated his enduring passion and influence in the game.\n\n\"It is testament to his talent and standing that he was one of the five 'Wisden Cricketers of the Year' in 1973 and was awarded the MBE in 1974 for services to cricket.\n\n\"He will be sadly missed and his wife Pat and their family and many friends are in our thoughts.\"",

(ABC News: Greg Bigelow)\n\nWith gentle words of encouragement from her keepers, she flips up one giant foot as if for a pedicure, so a safety belt wrapped around her ankle can be attached to the container.\n\nThe other foot soon follows, and she is rewarded with more snacks tossed into her open mouth by the keepers.\n\n\"Snacks are the way to win an elephant's heart,\" senior elephant keeper Johny Wade said.\n\n\"They're very much the key to building a lasting relationship with the elephants,\" Mr Wade said.\n\nEn route to South Australia\n\nBy the end of April, Tang Mo and her companion Pak Boon will be settling in to a new life with a new herd of elephants at the Monarto safari park on the Malee Plains, about an hour's drive east of Adelaide.\n\nMr Wade said the elephants would be accompanied by two support teams who would attend to their every need, and the safety belts would help keep the animals safe during the trip.\n\n\"It basically allows them to brace themselves on the journey, a bit like the handle you have on the bus when standing up,\" Mr Wade said.\n\n\"On the journey we will be checking them regularly, making sure they're doing well.\"\n\nSenior elephant keeper Johny Wade provides snacks and more for the elephants on the move. (ABC News: Greg Bigelow)\n\nThe CEO of the Taronga Conservation Society Cameron Kerr, said the elephants had been a \"beloved\" part of the zoo for many years, but the move was in their best interests.\n\n\"We've always been looking for another big site where we can bring elephants from different groups together to form a new community, because they are very complex social animals,\" he said.\n\n\"They are dearly loved by all our teams and so many of our visitors and zoo friends as well, so it's very sad to see them go. But there's two of them here and we feel there needs to be a bigger social group than that.\"\n\nTaronga Conservation Society CEO Cameron Kerr said the elephants would benefit from a larger social group.

(Supplied: Taronga Zoo)\n\nWhile their trip to South Australia will be a very long road trip, Mr Kerr said Tang Mo and Pak Boon had previously gained a reputation as jet-setters, having flown in from Thailand in 2006.\n\n\"Just to give you an indication of how smart these elephants are, after the very first take off and landing on Cocos Keeling Island, when they took off again when they heard the engines start up they knew to lean forward \u2014 that's incredible.\"\n\nFor all those who have been involved in their care, farewelling the zoo's final pair of elephants will be an emotional moment.\n\n\"We are part of their family, they're part of our family \u2014 we call us one big dysfunctional herd of humans and elephants,\" Mr Wade said.\n\n\"So it is going to be bittersweet; we are going to miss them when they go. But ultimately their welfare and their future is key to what we are doing.\"\n\nPack of elephants move to Werribee Photo shows A young elephant It took five days for a team to transport nine Asian elephants across Melbourne to a new home in Werribee.\n\nMr Wade said the elephants' different personalities meant keepers had to use quite different approaches to prepare them for the journey.\n\n\"They are very much chalk and cheese when it comes to personality; one is very food motivated, very stubborn, very strong-willed. The other one is very much about the relationship, she a bit airy-fairy, soft in nature.\"\n\nOnce the elephants have moved, their current habitat at the zoo will get some new tenants \u2014 who will have big shoes to fill.\n\nMr Kerr said Hari, the one-horned rhino who was born at Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo in 2021, would soon take up residence along with some water buffalo.\n\n\"We are calling this the great migration, so it's very exciting. We are bringing down Indian rhino, greater one-horned rhinos, \" he said.\n\n\"They are the most wonderful creatures \u2014 they're enormous rhinos, they've got the big wrinkly skin and they're gentle giants.\"",

There are no winners in a US-China trade war. The question is which country can endure the most pain and emerge with the least damage.\n\nAsked about the China negotiations on Tuesday afternoon during the swearing in of SEC chair Paul Atkins, Mr Trump did not say whether he had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nHowever, he said he was not going to \"play hardball with China\" and expects a deal to be reached soon.\n\n\"They have to, and other countries have to, make a deal. And if they don't make a deal, we'll set the deal,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nBut quickly added, \"We're gonna be very good to China.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations.\n\nBut the US president has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10 per cent tariff, even as he has insisted he is looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the US.\n\nChina calls on trade partners to oppose unilateral bullying\n\nBeijing on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the US that could negatively impact China.\n\n\"China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner. China is determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights and interests.\"\n\nMr Bessent said earlier this month the countries currently negotiating trade deals with the US should \"approach China as a group\" together with Washington.\n\nThe US tariffs on other countries amount to economic bullying, according to a statement from the Commerce Ministry attributed to an unnamed spokesperson.\n\n\"Appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot win respect,\" it added.\n\n\"For one's own temporary selfish interests, sacrificing the interests of others in exchange for so-called exemptions is like seeking the skin from a tiger. It will ultimately only fail on both ends and harm others without benefiting themselves.\"\n\nChina said it is open to talks with Washington but no meetings have been announced.\n\nABC/AP",

(Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\n\"The panel were prepared to accept that the player was, to use a neutral term, 'stunned' by the contact but did not consider that the evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion that he was affected to the point where he had lost control of his faculties, although they certainly did not consider that the player's actions were intentional,\" judiciary chair Geoff Bellew said.\n\n\"The panel considered it necessary to send a clear message to all players that dangerous contact of this kind will, if established, meet with significant penalties.\"\n\nBellew said the style of tackle, where defenders drop their weight to try to drag ball-runners to ground, carried \"significant risk of injury and in this case, that risk materialised\".\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nSipley said after the hearing that he had reached out to apologise to Feagai.\n\n\"Obviously you can see that they are trying to take the hip drop tackle out of the game, so I guess it is just one of those cases where it is what it is,\" Sipley said.\n\n\"I do feel [sorry] for injuring Mat, I did send out a message to him, and I will just do the four weeks.\"\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every round of the AFL and NRL seasons in 2025.\n\nSipley's team suggested a three-week ban based on an Elliott Whitehead tackle from last year that left Brandon Smith with a torn ACL last year, but the panel said the fact that another serious injury had occurred meant a bigger punishment was warranted.\n\n\"Given that it is now season 2025, the panel took the view that the only available conclusion was that penalties such as those imposed on player Whitehead were not acting as a sufficient deterrent,\" Bellew said.",

(ABC North Coast: Hannah Ross)\n\nMr Noble told the inquiry the tactic had helped the festival sell tickets.\n\n\"We made very sure underneath that we said, 'We don't want this to be the last festival, we're doing everything we can for it not to be', but in the end that's the sort of stuff you've gotta do nowadays,\" he said.\n\n\" And is that right \u2026 [that] people have got to be coerced to spend their money? \"\n\nBoon for business\n\nThe news Bluesfest will be on in 2026 is music to the ears of the Byron Bay Chamber of Commerce.\n\nPresident Matthew Williamson said the event was a vital part of the region's economy, particularly following the demise of other major festivals in Byron Shire.\n\n\"These types of events allow businesses to keep their heads above water,\" he said.\n\nMatt Williamson says news of the 2026 event is welcome, despite \"vaudevillian\" tactics. (Supplied)\n\nMr Williamson said he hoped public sentiment over the \"final Bluesfest\" marketing would not deter people from attending in future.\n\n\"I think Mr Noble's approach to marketing is his own business,\" he said.\n\n\"There has always been a little bit of a vaudevillian nature to Bluesfest, and its promotion, so if people choose to not respond to that, well, then that's up to them.\n\n\"He's free to promote his business as he sees fit.\"\n\nTraffic woes\n\nByron Shire Council said it was aware of reports of problems with patron transport, parking, and pedestrian control.\n\nThe council said it would be meeting with festival organisers to look at the event's management and what needed to be improved or changed prior to the next event.\n\nMr Williamson said the situation was disappointing.\n\n\"A lot of people come from out of the region and they want to enjoy the beaches and go to the shops and have a nice meal on town, and also go out to the festival,\" he said.\n\n\"People being able to move back and forth between Byron town and the festival is really important to local businesses.\"\n\nCoronavirus restrictions have hit live music and festivals particularly hard. (ABC: Margaret Burin)\n\nMr Noble said there were always aspects of major events that could be improved, but people had been warned to book bus tickets and parking ahead of time.\n\n\"It's very difficult. We don't know how to plan if we don't know what's happening,\" the festival director said.\n\n\" Every single week we said, 'Buy your bus tickets so we know what to put on'.

(Supplied: North West Hospital and Health Service)\n\nBut that has changed since a permanent renal dialysis unit was established at Mornington Island Hospital, enabling patients like Mr Watt to receive critical treatment on country.\n\n\"Indigenous people that come from this place, it's a privilege for them to come home and have dialysis,\" Mr Watt said.\n\nFrank Watt is relieved to be back home. (Supplied: North West Hospital and Health Service)\n\nThe ex-police liaison officer said receiving treatment locally was life-changing and he wanted other remote Indigenous communities to have the same opportunity.\n\n\"I reckon every community, Doomadgee, Normanton \u2026 they all need them,\" he said.\n\n\"They can go down the beach and do some fishing when they got day off, sit out with families and have a talk, a yarn, like they used to before they got sick.\"\n\nMelinda Foster and Dorita Escott benefit from the new service.

(Supplied: Des Mellican)\n\nMornington Island, nestled in the Gulf of Carpentaria off the north coast of Queensland, is home to about 1,000 residents.\n\nMr Watt recalled family members who were being treated for dialysis on the mainland sometimes died there, away from their loved ones back home.\n\n\"Most of them couldn't make it back,\" Mr Watt said.\n\n\"It cost a lot of money to bring home a family member back on the island for a funeral.\"\n\n'Significant improvement', but more centres needed\n\nMr Watt was one of the first patients to be treated at the new renal dialysis unit at Mornington Island Hospital when it opened in June last year.\n\nThe six-chair unit caters to those who independently dialyse and those requiring clinical support from specialist dialysis nurses.\n\nIt was a boost from the previous temporary two-chair, satellite supported haemodialysis unit.\n\nScott Windor has seen how patients' lives have improved. (Supplied: North West Hospital and Health Service)\n\nMornington Island director of nursing Scott Windsor said it was a \"significant improvement\" in the quality of life for dialysis patients.\n\n\"Having access to such critical services locally means that patients can maintain their routines and support networks, which is vital to their wellbeing,\" Mr Windsor said.\n\nNorth West Hospital and Health Service chief executive Sean Birgan said the response from the island's patients was encouraging.\n\n\"The new, more permanent renal dialysis unit allows us to deliver healthcare services more efficiently and effectively, providing better continuity of care and enhancing overall patient experience,\" Mr Birgan said.\n\nBack on the mainland, 150km south-east, Normanton Hospital is currently undergoing a significant upgrade, due to open mid-2025.\n\nIn 2024 the federal government announced $18.58 million for additional dialysis units across multiple locations in remote Australia, including Normanton.\n\nA specific timeline for dialysis at Normanton has not been confirmed, but Mr Birgan said it would be coming to the new hospital.\n\n\"They want the capability to deliver dialysis. That's a service they don't currently have,\" he said.\n\n\"I can confirm that the new building will have the capability of delivering renal dialysis.\"\n\nThe old hospital was knocked down for new pre-fabricated modules.

    "text": "The federal government has doubled down on its decision to give YouTube a carve-out from the teen social media ban, despite privately assuring rival platforms that \"no final decisions\" have been made, the ABC can reveal.\n\nThe government disputes that it has made contradictory statements, but the revelation further complicates what competitors have described as a ''sweetheart deal\" for the video streaming giant.\n\nFrom December, all Australians will have to prove they are older than 16 to use most social media sites, but Communications Minister Michelle Rowland is yet to formalise which platforms will be covered.\n\nThe legislation states the minister must seek advice from the eSafety Commissioner first \u2014 something Ms Rowland has not yet done.\n\nDespite that, the government now appears to be discussing the exemption for YouTube as if it is a done deal.\n\nThe government told the ABC the decision to exclude YouTube was made five months ago, and it had not wavered since, but emails seen by the ABC suggest Ms Rowland's office gave a very different message to a YouTube rival as recently as last month.\n\nYouTube's rivals slam draft ban for 'sweetheart deal' Photo shows A high school student poses with her mobile showing her social media applications. The federal government has been accused of making a \"sweetheart deal\" to exempt YouTube from the teen social media ban, as YouTube's competitors kick off a co-ordinated public campaign against the move.\n\nThe email from early March, sent by a senior ministerial staffer to a YouTube competitor in reply to concerns over the YouTube exemption, stated: \"I can reassure you that no final decisions are imminent and will not occur until the full consultation is complete.\"\n\nIt went on to acknowledge that the minister has an obligation to seek advice from regulators such as the eSafety Commissioner first.\n\n\"Once the current stakeholder phase of consultation is completed, the next phase will be to seek the advice of the relevant regulators, per our legislative obligation,\" the staffer wrote.\n\nMs Rowland's office responded to questions from the ABC by doubling down on its claim that the decision to exempt YouTube is nothing new.\n\n\"The Minister's decision to exclude YouTube was made in November last year, publicly stated in a media release and reflected in the second reading of the legislation,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"That decision has been made and there has been zero reconsideration or communication to suggest otherwise \u2014 despite misleading attempts by Snapchat, Facebook and TikTok to imply that it was.\"\n\nThe spokesperson did not provide any further clarification on the matter.\n\nLoading...\n\nHow did we get here? The YouTube saga so far\n\nThe government has stated its intention to exempt YouTube several times since the policy was first announced, although the language has sometimes shifted depending on the context.\n\nWhen the teen social media ban was announced in November, Ms Rowland said YouTube would be part of the ban, and that there were \"no outs\" for social media giants.\n\nYouTube Kids might be an exception, she said at the time, because of its educational role for children and families.\n\nTwo weeks later, by the time the bill was making its way through parliament, the government's position changed, and YouTube was earmarked for an \"expected\" exemption.\n\nSeveral weeks after that, the minister wrote a letter to YouTube's global CEO, in which she said she \"reaffirms\" the government's \"commitment\" that YouTube would avoid the ban.\n\nThe letter only came to light last week under Freedom of Information laws, more than four months after it was sent.\n\nYouTube's rivals hit back at proposed exemption\n\nOfficially, the rules to determine once and for all which platforms will be exempt are only at a draft phase.\n\nThe version of those rules made public in February this year singled out YouTube for an exemption from the ban, triggering a backlash from Snapchat, Meta and TikTok.\n\nThey accused the government of making a \"sweetheart deal\" to exempt the platform, with TikTok arguing it was \"akin to banning the sale of soft drinks to minors but exempting Coca-Cola\".\n\nIn March, Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said the notion of exempting YouTube \"makes a mockery of the Government's stated intention \u2026 to protect young people\".\n\nIt argued the platform uses all the same features the government has deemed unsafe for children, including algorithmic content recommendations, never-ending auto-play, and persistent notifications and alerts.\n\n\"YouTube's exemption is at odds with the purported reasons for the [teen social media ban],\" a Meta spokesperson told the ABC.\n\nA timeline of the shifting statements on YouTube's social media ban exemption",

(ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nBut National Tertiary Education Union president Alison Barnes said the policy was \"misleading\" and short-sighted.\n\n\"It's going to really impact the fabric of regional universities and metropolitan universities,\" Ms Barnes said.\n\n\"It's going to lead to issues like job cuts, and when you're looking at losses to jobs, that has a devastating impact on the individual who is impacted, but it has a devastating impact on the communities in which people live and work.\"\n\nMs Barnes told ABC Ballarat the Liberals' pledge painted international students in a way that was not accurate or fair.\n\n\"A big study came out of universities in South Australia that demonstrates there was no link to international students and the cost of renting,\" Ms Barnes said.\n\nStudy finds international students 'thrown under the bus' Photo shows a female students at an exam table International students have been \"thrown under the bus\" and unfairly blamed for the rental crisis, according to new study.\n\n\" It's an argument I think that plays to people's concerns and fears around cost of living, and they're very fair and valid concerns, but it unfairly demonises international students. \"\n\nMs Henderson said the policy would focus on \"restoring the balance\" especially in Sydney and Melbourne, where most international students live and study.\n\nA Coalition campaign spokesperson said they expected the cap on public universities would be \"around the range of 25 per cent\" of current enrolments.\n\n\"But we will work with the higher education sector in government with access to the latest data, as the only publicly available information [on international student enrolments at Australian universities] available is from 2023,\" they said.\n\n\"We are aware there are special issues in relation to various regional public universities, which is why we will work with the sector to avoid unintended consequences.\"\n\nMr Dutton and Ms Henderson declined to elaborate on planned caps at specific universities.\n\nRegional hub hopeful\n\nDuncan Bentley is the vice chancellor of Federation University, which has campuses in regional Victoria and outer Melbourne.\n\nProfessor Bentley said a 25 per cent cap on international student enrolments was more favourable than the 52.3 per cent cut from 2023 enrolments proposed by the 2024 Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee.\n\nUnder the proposal, institutions each had their own individual caps within the national total of 270,000 places.\n\n\"We were quite badly hit by the numbers given to us in our [2024 Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee proposed] cap and the certainty that will increase under a Coalition government for regional universities like ours where we had an under allocation of international places is vitally important for regional skills growth,\" Mr Bentley said.\n\nAlec Webb is the CEO of the Regional Universities Network. (Supplied: RUN)\n\nRegional Universities Network chief executive officer Alec Webb met the policy with scepticism.\n\n\"The devil will be in the policy detail, which we currently do not have,\" Mr Webb said.",

    "text": "On average, so far, the McLaren has been just over a quarter of a per cent faster than the Red Bull, even if it has taken \u201conly\u201d three poles from six qualifying sessions. That equates to 0.27 seconds on a theoretical one-minute and 40-second lap. Who, though, has been getting the most from their car? Not Norris, whose average qualifying position is 4.67. That is not just below Piastri (2.0) and Verstappen (3.0), but also George Russell (3.5) in a Mercedes. As he said, he is letting himself down and making life (and his championship hopes) harder than it needs to be.\n\nPiastri is yet to qualify worse than third and has four front-row starts compared to Norris, who has started in the top two only twice. In the last two rounds, he has been in grid spots six and 10. Verstappen has two poles and one other front-row start. Maximising lap time Another useful measure of how well a driver is performing over one qualifying lap is whether they are maximising their potential. You can work this out by looking at the difference between a driver\u2019s best lap time and comparing it to their theoretical best \u2013 calculated by totalling a driver\u2019s best three sector times. For instance, a driver may have recorded best sector times of 20.1seconds, 32.5 seconds and 29.4 seconds (1 minute 22 seconds in total) but their best lap time in qualifying could be 1 minute 22.2 seconds, which means they left two-tenths on the table from what they theoretically could have achieved. Looking at the data from the lead trio, it is painfully obvious that Norris trails by this metric. He has put together his theoretical best in the decisive final qualifying period twice. That is the same as Piastri, but one fewer than Verstappen.\n\nOscar Piastri and Lando Norris after the Australian won the Bahrain grand prix. Credit: Getty Images However, dig a little deeper and the picture is worse. His best lap time is on average 0.187 seconds down on his theoretical best, giving away seven-tenths in the Chinese sprint race, 0.147 seconds in qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix and two-tenths in Bahrain. By contrast, Piastri is giving away just 0.061 seconds and Verstappen 0.043 seconds. Piastri has only given away more than a tenth on two occasions, and Verstappen once. Clearly, this has been driven by those well-noted Norris errors. Races There are several metrics you can look at, but again, the lack of quality in the second Red Bull makes any team-mate comparison almost pointless. Away from Verstappen\u2019s utter dominance at Red Bull, Piastri has finished as the lead McLaren in three of the five grands prix.\n\nNorris, though, has the higher average finishing position at McLaren at 2.4 compared to 3.0, excluding the sprint race. That is largely because of Piastri\u2019s ninth-place finish in Australia. Piastri has been the stronger driver since that point. Verstappen\u2019s average finishing position of third, then, is more impressive than both Piastri and Norris. China was a tough race for him (not as tough as Bahrain), but he still extracted close to the maximum from the car. Perhaps the only race he did not maximise the performance of the RB21 was in Saudi Arabia, when he let a lead slip at the start and incurred a five-second time penalty. Looking at laps led, Piastri leads the way with 124, with Verstappen on 66 and then Norris on 60. Of course, it is better to lead the final lap of the race than to have led all of the previous ones. Still, it is clear who is doing better.\n\nWinning margins can be a misleading statistic because there are so many other factors involved such as race and tyre management, as well as safety cars. They provide a decent guide overall, but come with caveats. Of the meaningful races there is only really Verstappen\u2019s 1.4 second-margin in Japan and Piastri\u2019s 15 seconds in Bahrain (after 22 laps of racing) and his 2.8 seconds in Saudi Arabia. Verdict: Verstappen the better driver, Piastri the more likely champion There are other intangible factors that will play a part in the destination of the title in the next 19 rounds. Errors will be one of them, as will mentality and luck, especially if it stays as close as it is. Considering what we have looked at above, we would rate Verstappen as the top-performing driver by a small margin over Piastri. The Dutchman will likely have a battle on his hands to stay in championship contention, though, because of his car. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen. Credit: Getty Images",

So to go through that for another six weeks, we just thought it was too hard, not only on him, but on our footy club and our playing group, so we accept the decision, and we move on.\u201d Yze said the club had not expected a curfew, but they knew the defender was going to be sanctioned.\n\nLoading \u201cDealing with that is just part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I said, he\u2019s really remorseful.

He\u2019ll speak when he when it\u2019s his right time to speak and you will sense how remorseful he is.\u201d Balta played his first game of the season against the Gold Coast last Saturday, and will be expected to line up for the Tigers again against Hawthorn in a day match at the MCG in round eight.\n\nYze said Richmond would bring in 195-centimetre youngster Campbell Gray, 21, to make his debut on Thursday night. Gray was taken at pick 16 in the 2024 mid-season rookie draft. Roos lash out at \u2018coach bashing\u2019 of Clarkson AAP North Melbourne have come out swinging in defence of Alastair Clarkson with football boss Todd Viney lashing \u201cdisrespectful\u201d criticism and \u201ccoach bashing\u201d of the Kangaroos mentor. North have lost their past four games by an average of almost 59 points and reached a season-low with an embarrassing 82-point defeat to Carlton on Good Friday.\n\nClarkson has come under fire, but Viney, who also worked with him at Hawthorn, scoffed at any suggestion the four-time premiership mentor had lost his edge. \u201cI find it amusing, really. I find it probably disrespectful,\u201d Viney said on SEN on Wednesday. Tough days: Alastair Clarkson is working to turn North Melbourne\u2019s fortunes around. Credit: AFL Photos \u201cThis is not only to Clarko but this is something that\u2019s pointed at senior coaches all the time. It\u2019s almost like a sport ... There is a sport around putting undue pressure on senior coaches in my view.\u201d Viney pointed out 2025 was the first season where Clarkson hadn\u2019t also been dealing with the fallout from the Hawthorn racism saga.\n\n\u201cNot many clubs can really perform at their best when they\u2019ve got such distractions going on,\u201d Viney continued. \u201c... He\u2019s had enormous distractions, unwarranted criticisms, judged unfairly \u2013 it\u2019s taken an enormous toll on him over those two years. \u201cEventually we\u2019re into this third year, two years and six games in. He\u2019s a rejuvenated person, back to his old self, a lot of energy, seeing the game as well as he\u2019s ever seen it.\u201d Viney was adamant Clarkson was well supported and seeing the game \u201cas well as he ever has\u201d but the Kangaroos were in the early stages of building their game. \u201cThe criticism is really unwarranted,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of a sport, the coach-bashing thing. \u201cIt\u2019s a tall-poppy syndrome which is the Australian culture \u2013 we pick on the guys who have been successful and in time ultimately bring them down.\u201d\n\nLoading Ahead of Saturday\u2019s away clash with Port Adelaide, Viney was adamant the Kangaroos were strong and aligned across the board and wouldn\u2019t deviate from their plans. \u201cA lot of things are going well so we won\u2019t be fractured, we won\u2019t fall into jumping at shadows with all the noise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the game gives us nothing and we need to deserve to win games. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to give us anything and we don\u2019t expect it, we expect to cop our right whack with performances like the weekend. \u201cBut we won\u2019t hear that everything we\u2019re doing is not right because there is a lot of positive things that are going right.\u201d",

Credit: Ashley Mar If you\u2019re Christopher Cross, a man who could justifiably be credited with creating the genre known as yacht rock (smooth, adult-contemporary music of the late \u201970s and early \u201980s) thanks to his 1980 hit singles Sailing and Ride Like The Wind, you strategically spread them out to one killer track every half an hour. Arthur\u2019s Theme (Best That You Can Do) completes Cross\u2019s crowd-pleasing trifecta.\n\nThe rest of his set is wisely padded out with songs from his hit 1979 self-titled debut album, although a tune he refers to as a \u201cdeep cut\u201d called Dreamers and a new song called You both sound good enough to prove he\u2019s more than just a guy with a few 45-year-old hits. American pop-rock band Toto have a few better-known songs to their name, but the rule of three bulletproof crowd-pleasers applies to them, too. One of those, 1982\u2019s Rosanna, is second cab off the rank and goes down as well as you\u2019d expect, even if only one person on stage \u2013 guitarist and singer Steve Lukather \u2013 is an original Toto member. The seven band members are all masterful musicians, particularly new keyboardist and singer Dennis Atlas, who plays his instrument as if he\u2019s been teleported straight from the \u201980s, even though he\u2019s the youngest by far at 27. Despite the skills on display, some sins are committed: several songs turn into extended jams (always more fun for players than audience; in that vein we also get solos on keyboard (two) and drum). There are a few decent songs along the way such as 99 and I\u2019ll Supply the Love, but more that feel like a chore to get through. It all becomes a bit of an AM radio-friendly soup.\n\nThen, finally, bulletproof, crowd-pleasing redemption: 1978 pop-rock classic Hold the Line livens things up considerably, the perfect entree for Toto\u2019s defining song, 1982\u2019s Africa, which seems to have only increased in popularity as the decades have rolled on thanks to numerous remixes, covers and pop culture references. It\u2019s a glorious note to go out on and makes up for a gig that could have done with a few more songs of the same calibre. MUSIC\n\nSYDNEY PHILHARMONIA CHOIRS\n\nSydney Opera House Concert Hall, April 17\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nReviewed by Harriet Cunningham Sydney Philharmonia Choirs\u2019 Vox and Chamber ensembles have come together with the Australian Romantic and Classical Orchestra (ARCO) to present Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion in the 1841 arrangement of the work by Felix Mendelssohn. St Matthew Passion: the choir responded to conductor Elizabeth Scott with impressive precision and energy. Credit: Keith Saunders\n\nIn the 300 or so years since Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion was first performed, it has undergone myriad transformations: there have been changes in instrumentation, pitch and structure and it has been staged as an opera and a ballet. Mendelssohn\u2019s version, as recreated by ARCO\u2019s team of specialists, is notable for its orchestration. In place of a largely improvised keyboard and viola da gamba continuo, we hear Mendelssohn\u2019s written-out accompaniments for two cellos and bass. In place of the obsolete oboes da caccia, Mendelssohn writes for the new-fangled clarinet and basset horn. At times it feels like a revelation, a radically different palette of tone colours, bringing unfamiliar texture and suspense to the score. At others, it feels like an unfamiliar intrusion, especially when pitch goes awry between historic instruments and contemporary voices. The period interpretation also features romantic styles of rubato, which sound mannered to this modern ear. The Passion is a drama of many characters, some represented by singers, some by instruments. The choristers are particularly versatile, at one moment playing the mob, angry and ready to roar, and at another lulling us into contemplative wonder with a pianissimo chorale. It may be a small army of voices but it responds to conductor Elizabeth Scott with impressive precision and energy.\n\nScott has also assembled an excellent line-up of soloists: Andrew O\u2019Connor plays many roles with consummate skill and Penelope Mills brings fine clarity to the soprano roles, while Emily Edmonds\u2019 mezzo soprano voice is full of warmth. Concertmaster Rachael Beesley and flutist Melissa Farrow bring mellifluous virtuosity to their obligato accompaniments while Teddy Tahu Rhodes shines as a charismatic and eloquent Christus. Finally, the hero of the evening is Andrew Goodwin as the Evangelist, his voice reaching into the heavens with sublime ease. BLUES\n\nGary Clark Jr\n\nEnmore Theatre, April 17\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nReviewed by Bernard Zuel The clue was in his entrance. Long, extravagantly lean and topped by a high, wide and handsomely white hat, Texan Gary Clark Jr ambled on like he was just passing through. He sang of suspicion and resistance: Gary Clark Jnr Credit: Ashley Mar\n\nIt was like purpose was at his disposal \u2013 like time was flexible, elastic even, and to be shaped not so much by will as by example. And it was. Even as the band began playing, a long, atmosphere-heavy introduction was measured in its tempo but deliberately vague in its intentions, all possibilities open. Then this moody, chugging blues emerged and Maktub took shape: decidedly north African in its desert airy expansiveness, it suggested both movement and stasis, with Clark\u2019s slide guitar in long strides rather than stealthy steps. He sang of suspicion and resistance in the tone of someone wearied by the fight but not bent by it; he warned \u201cjust tell \u2019em, we\u2019re coming\u201d but cautioned \u201cwe gotta move in the same direction\u201d, with the patience of someone who has been this way before. And so it went, always undulating rather than surging, for almost 10 minutes, time immaterial. And so it went for the rest of the night: as the hour mark ticked over, Clark and band had only just started on their seventh song. There would be only four more, including an encore, in a show of almost two hours. In that time-defying space, variety was not as pronounced as in his most recent albums, which have seen Clark expand his remit well beyond Texas blues. Still, you could hear echoes of Parliament/Funkadelic in the loose, odd, rhythmically insistent Alone Together, while the hands of Curtis Mayfield and D\u2019Angelo \u2013 old soul and nu-soul - could be felt in R&B-driven numbers like the righteously moved Feed The Babies, the first time Clark\u2019s falsetto emerged.\n\nOne of those predecessors would probably have encouraged Clark to shorten the too-long preamble to the set\u2019s closer, Habits, which seemed a culmination of the noodling that crept in during the final stages of the night and served to speed the exit of some in the audience. But then the man might have responded by pointing out how the Catherine wheel of a solo which climaxed said noodling and the night all but washed away such thoughts \u2013 as if they, like time, didn\u2019t matter. THEATRE\n\nSNAKEFACE\n\nBelvoir Street 25A, April 11\n\nReviewed by HARRIET CUNNINGHAM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAliyah Knight, playwright and performer, is already on stage as the audience files into Belvoir Street\u2019s downstairs theatre and is still there when the lights go up. It feels like there is nowhere else to go. Just a scrim at the back (used to project text, sometimes readable, sometimes censored) and a block of stone \u2013 which turns out to be clay \u2013 centre stage. Music fills up the remaining space, enveloping and energising a young queer figure of colour as they spin, sway and groove.\n\nA coming-of-age story, a myth, a fever dream and a mystery: Snakeface is written and performed by Aliyah Knight. Credit: Abraham de Souza, Fruit Box Theatre Snakeface is many things: a coming-of-age story, a myth, a fever dream and a mystery. Its title references the murderous, snake-haired Medusa of Greek myth. Knight\u2019s imagination transforms Medusa into a victim, made into a monster by sexual violence. This becomes a springboard into the mind and body of a woman whose transformation is anything but mythical. Loading There\u2019s a gritty, joyful authenticity about much of Knight\u2019s script, which captures the wide-eyed curiosity and liminal sensation of a life-hungry teenager. They watch two beads of sweat running down a naked man\u2019s chest and wonder which wins the race; they catch eyes with a stranger in a bar and hallucinate with pleasure. There\u2019s poetry in the prose of the young woman\u2019s words, and it clashes with the ugly words jumping out from the poetry projected on the backdrop. Knight delivers it all with fluency, flipping from chatter to chant in a sustained monologue, which I would be fascinated to read.",

We have immediate support through cost of living assistance, whilst making sure that we invest in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest Roy Morgan survey suggests Labor would be returned to government with an increased majority of 55.5 per cent on a two-party preferred basis, if the election was held today.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis compares to the Coalition on 44.5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton blamed the coalition's sliding polls on Labor, who he says have spent the campaign slinging mud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, Ally, the Labor Party spent $20 million throwing mud and negative ads, and that has an impact, and I get that but for a lot of Australian families over the course of the next few days they're going to have to make a decision about what's in their best interest and what's in our country's best interest.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWith host Ally Langdon encouraging the pair to avoid using their time repeating familiar talking points, both leaders were asked to nominate the \"biggest lie\" the other has told about them and given the chance to refute it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being asked for just one, Peter Dutton couldn't help but offer more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust one? Geez Charles. Making it hard. The $600 billion figure comes from a company that is a donor to the Labor party, full of donors, Labor staffers. Discredited, and it is at odds with a hundred and twenty billion dollar figure for the construction of nuclear power sites, which is the CSIRO figure. In relation to Medicare, the whole Medicare scare campaign which has been going on at subsequent elections for a long period of time. The fact is that bulk building has plummeted under this Prime Minister, people can't afford to go to the doctors because the out of pocket expense now is about $43 per person when you going to the doctor.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Anthony Albanese says it's Mr Dutton who has the numbers wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMedicare is at the centre of this campaign, and we will strengthen Medicare. Peter uses a figure about about bulk billing that takes into account the fact that Australians had to get COVID shots during the pandemic, and that boosted artificially the numbers. But the truth is, bulk billing was in free fall because the incoming Liberal government, the last time they won ripped $50 billion out of the hospital system. This Minister, when Peter was the health minister, tried to introduce the GP tax, which would have abolished bulk billing, all together, and when he couldn't do that, what happened was that there was a six year freeze on the Medicare rebate which sent off billing into a free fall.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair went on for a while about the numbers, before things turned a little more personal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cALBANESE: In the budget, prior to you coming to office, you ripped $80 billion out of those two items in 2014.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"Prime Minister, you couldn't lie straight in bed. Honestly, this is unbelievable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE:\" Well, you can go to abuse. You can go to personal abuse. that's a sign of desperation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"Well as is lying\"\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"That's a sign of desperation, go to the 2014 budget papers. People can do that online. It's all available for all to see\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWith their biggest clash of the night out of the way early on, the pair moved to some of the biggest talking points of the campaign so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn housing, Peter Dutton says the coalition has no plans to make any changes to negative gearing or capital gains tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that we can have the tax settings in place so that we can encourage investment, because young Australians have to rent for a period of time until they can afford to get into their own home and if we don't have investors in the market, then we don't have that rental accommodation and we reduce the stock of housing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says his government is focusing on supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we are concentrating on is supply. We won't be making the changes that you suggest because we're concerned that it would have a negative impact on supply and would push up rents. That is why we are not making those changes, and we haven't done so. But this idea that the housing crisis has occurred over the last two years is just a nonsense, just a nonsense, and everyone out there knows that it's the case and they didn't even bother to have a Housing Minister for half of the time that they were in government.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the cost of living, Mr Albanese says that while he knows people are doing it tough, Labor is offering real relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe understand that many people are doing it tough, which is why we've provided significant cost of living relief but we've had to do it in a way that put that downward pressure on inflation. As a result, inflation as a two in front of it 2.4 But at the same time, we've created a million jobs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton says the government has squandered a commodities windfall and rising interest rates are a home-grown problem of the government's making.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cuts the Coalition would rely upon to pay for policies are still under wraps.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton says the coalition's plan to cut fuel costs will deliver relief to every Australian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt goes across the economy. So it's not just for families who are doing it tough. Pensioners are really doing it tough because they've got fixed incomes and rising costs under this government. Electricity is up by thirty two percent. Gas is up by thirty four percent and for those pensioners and self funded retirees, for small businesses as well, they benefit. So whether petrol is at two dollar a litre or a dollar fifty a litre, it will always be 25 cents cheaper under us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked what the biggest risk to Australia is right now, Mr Albanese took the opportunity to revisit one of Mr Dutton's less flattering moments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cComplacency and the uncertain world that we inherit, In an uncertain times it's the last, last time where you'd want to take a risk. Peter spoke about his long experience, and that's true, but that's the problem. Every pacific leader remembers him joking about water lapping at their doors. For the Pacific Island neighbours. It's not a joke, climate change, it's something that is the entry fee to credibility in our region.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, the panel of Nine journalists delivered their verdict, and Peter Dutton has won 2-1.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis debate coincided with the opening of early voting across the country, with time running out for leaders to convince voters of their policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy midday, the Australian Electoral Commission reported 230,000 Australians had already cast their vote.\n\n\n\n",

Honestly, this is unbelievable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese: \"Well, you can go to abuse. You can go to personal abuse. that's a sign of desperation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton: \"Well as is lying\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese: \"That's a sign of desperation, go to the 2014 budget papers. People can do that online. It's all available for all to see\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith less than two weeks until voters make their final decision on May 3, Tuesday's debate was one of the last opportunities for the leaders to win over undecided Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe esteemed panel of Nine journalists delivered their verdict, declaring Peter Dutton the winner 2-1.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition has made an election pledge to spend $21 billion over the next five years on defence, which would take its share of Australia's gross domestic product to 2.5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Peter Dutton says if his party is elected, the level of defence spending - as a percentage of Australia's economy - would then rise further to three per cent within the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Coalition said it would use the money to reinstate a fourth joint strike fighter squadron, it did not say where else the funding would go.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton says the extra spending on defence was needed in uncertain times globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal security sources say at least 28 people are feared killed, after suspected militants opened fire on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attack occurred in Pahalgam, a popular holiday destination in the scenic mountainous region where mass tourism, especially during the summer months, has resurged as Islamist militant violence has eased in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the worst attack in the region on civilians for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vatican has announced that the funeral for Pope Francis will take place on April 26 at St Peter's Basilica.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a break from tradition, Pope Francis has elected to be buried in Rome's Basilica of Saint Mary Major, and not St Peter's Basilica.\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinals of the Catholic Church will gather to select the next pontiff, but no clear frontrunner has emerged yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish Cardinal Timothy Ratcliffe says he trusts the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that we always open ourselves to be surprised. All recent popes have been quite different from each other. And often we think, will the pope in fact continue the legacy of the previous one? But we trust that the bishop of Rome, whom we need now, will be given us. And we may be surprised.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says a revised growth forecast for the global economy shows \"trade tensions are weighing heavily on the global outlook and putting upward pressure on inflation around the world\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund now forecasts global growth at 2.8 percent for 2025, a sharp 0.5 percentage points reduction from its January estimate, with a further slowdown to 3 percent projected for 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nIMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas says the revised forecast is due to escalating trade conflicts and heightened policy uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The surge in policy uncertainty is a major driver of the economic outlook. If sustained, the increase in trade tensions and uncertainty will slow global growth significantly. Reflecting this complexity, our report presents a reference forecast which incorporates policy announcements up to April 4th by the US and trading partners.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Dr Chalmers says the election provides voters with a choice on the major party's approaches to managing the \"turmoil in the global economy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-polling booths are opening across the country and with more than half of the electorate expected to vote this way, voters in parts of the Tiwi Islands have cast their ballots.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting services visited the small community of Pirlangimpi yesterday offering voters their only chance to cast a ballot in person.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community sits within the marginal seat of Lingiari, which Labor currently holds, but opposition leader Peter Dutton is hoping to flip.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis voter told NITV what he is hoping to see from whoever wins government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" Hopefully the government will, you know, change their mind and bring some money to the Tiwi Islands, and like I said, the roads, housing - we're living in an overcrowded house. Move those COVID containers, so that way when there's COVID we get to spend more times at our homeland rather than in that community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo surfing now...\n\n\n\n\n\nA freak accident at Bells Beach has forced Moroccan surfer Ramzi Boukhiam out of the Rip Curl Pro with a serious-looking knee injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoukhiam did not surf his elimination-round heat after the accident, knocking him out of the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 31-year-old had finished his opening-round heat earlier on Tuesday and was nearly on the beach when his foot was apparently caught in the reef close to the shoreline.\n\n\n\n",

Speaking in unison while wearing identical clothing, they described how their mother went to help a man with blood all over his face only to be threatened by the gun-toting man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One guy, he was up there with our mum. He went up there and he was coming back down toward us,\" one said, as the other finished her sister's sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And he goes 'run, he's got a gun!'\" the sisters said at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video has been described as one of \"the greatest news interviews of all time\" by media figures, while others were stunned at the unique characteristic trait: \"This can't be real, right?\".\n\n\n\nTwin sisters Bridgette and Paula Powers rescue and rehabilitate water birds and seabirds at their sanctuary in Queensland.

It's us, and we've tied not to talk together, and it's impossible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time the sisters have gained global attention for their unique ability. In 2016, the sisters did an interview with British TV, with former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan saying: \"It is one of the greatest interviews I have ever conducted in my life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked how they were able to speak together at the same time, the sisters said in unison: \"It comes automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't know how it happens.

Clearly, our relationship with politicians has changed over the decades, but it's the lowest approval rating we have measured for an Opposition leader this century,\" Elgood said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said a quarter of those surveyed don't have an opinion on Dutton's performance, while 30 per cent would prefer him as prime minister.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The voters who could see more misinformation this election\n\nAlbanese's ratings were not much higher than those of Dutton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the end of his first term, only a third of the country thinks he's [Albanese] on the right track,\" Elgood said. \"Forty-two per cent think Labor has done a poor job and someone else should have a go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent Newspoll, published in The Australian newspaper on Monday, showed a lift in Labor's primary vote to 34 per cent, with the Coalition on 35 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a two-party preferred basis, Labor is at 52 per cent, ahead of the coalition's 48 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton was favoured as preferred leader in areas such as defence and the economy, but Albanese was preferred on the electorate's dominant concern, the cost of living, along with housing and health.\n\n\n\nSupport for a majority government is 'really weak'\n\nElgood said that back-to-back Easter and Anzac Day public holidays could mean voters take leave from work and disengage from the election campaigns, which could make it harder for candidates to get their messages across to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't feel that the electorate are particularly switched on with the campaign. Also, the government's ability in getting its message out there is not particularly compelling,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShaun Ratcliff, a political scientist from research firm Accent Research, said voters are also moving away from the two major parties, with support for a majority government \"really weak\".\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Party Time: The Players SBS News 10/04/2025 29:05 Play\n\nThis could result in more people turning towards the Greens and independents, Ratcliff said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only 56 per cent of voters actually think that a majority Labor or Coalition government is better for Australia than some other alternative,\" he told the National Press Club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Forty-four per cent believe that some kind of minority government would actually be better for the country. And this is a real generational divide.\"\n\n\n\nMoving away from the major parties\n\nA large share of \"important demographics\" would prefer a minority government, where neither Labour nor the Coalition would hold the balance of power, Ratcliff said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sixty per cent of those aged 18 to 34 think a minority government would be better for Australia. As do 58 per cent of those aged 35 to 49,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fifty-nine per cent of those in a great deal of financial stress believe a minority government would be better for Australia, and 62 of renters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese groups are \"actively seeking an alternative\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're driving the fragmentation of the Australian political system and pushing us towards minority government,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What if no one wins? What to know about minority government\n\nKos Samaras, director at the political consultancy firm Redbridge, said the Coalition needs to change tactics if it wants to see an improvement in the polls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're dealing with a very different Australia,\" Samaras said. \"And I think the only solution for the Coalition if they're to turn the polls around in the next two weeks, is to pivot and find a way to talk to those younger voters that they're losing to their flank.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSamaras said RedBridge's research suggested both Labor and the Coalition were losing gen Z and millennial voters to minor parties, but the Coalition in particular was struggling to win them back.\n\n\n\nGreens winning among younger voters\n\nSamaras said: \"Within gen Z, our most recent analysis, where we're just surveying Liberal versus Labor contests \u2014 the Greens primary is the highest at 33 per cent. Higher than Labor, higher than the Liberal Party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said focusing more on outer suburban home buyers and tax reforms could help the Coalition \"turn some of those polls around\".\n\n\n\nElgood said the cost of living remains the main issue for voters this election, which could be an opening for Dutton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Liberals need to do more to convince voters they can meaningfully impact the cost of living crisis, and that Peter Dutton can deliver that stability they lack from Albanese,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's only a short amount of time available, and they need to do something slightly more risky.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

This is the strength of the Christian community. Let us seek to be guardians and builders of unity!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the ways Francis sought to build this cross cultural unity was through his many visits abroad, such as this historic visit to Timor-Leste last Septembe.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it may not have seemed like an obvious destination for the pope to some, Timor-Leste has the highest proportion of Catholics outside of the Vatican, at 97 per cent of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three-day visit drew estimated crowds of 600,000, considered the biggest event since the country gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimor-Leste's President Jose Ramos-Horta makes it clear how much the faith leader meant to his country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just received information that Papa Francisco has passed away a few minutes ago. Not only we the Catholic Church, all religions and all humanity have suffered a tremendous loss. We all remember the Pope's Visit to Timor Leste last September, before boarding the plane to return to Rome, while holding my hand for the last time and telling me, 'please pay close attention to this beloved people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis also understood the need for flexibility in how Catholic liturgy was disseminated to different cultural communities across the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2024, Francis approved liturgical adaptations to the needs and circumstances of indigenous communities in southern Mexico, the Amazon Australia\u2019s Aboriginal communities in the Diocese of Broome.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pope's awareness that the future of the Catholic Church may lay outside of its European origin point was also reflected in his choices for cardinal appointments.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many centuries, most Catholic cardinals were Italian, a norm that had begun to be broken down by Pope Paul VI in the 1960s and accelerated by Polish Pope John Paul II, who was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis appointed more than 20 cardinals from countries that had never previously had a cardinal, nearly all of them from developing countries such as Rwanda, Bangladesh, Cape Verde, Tonga, Myanmar, Mongolia and South Sudan, or countries with very few Catholics such as Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn South Sudan, worshipper and activist Jacob Chol says his community is mourning an advocate of peace in Sudan and South Sudan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today is very sad news for all of us in South Sudan and in Sudan, that we lost our great hero who actually worked for peace for this country. We remember when our leaders went to Rome, when he went and kissed their feet. We tell them a message, which is actually very, very important, that I want you guys, when you go back home, make sure those who are left behind, let them be the fruits of this country. Because he really urged our leaders in the country that we have peace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen electing cardinals, he repeatedly overlooked vacancies in major European cities that traditionally had cardinals, often looking to where he believed the Church had more potential to grow in comparison to the mostly stagnant West.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes three cardinals appointed in the Philippines, which has Asia's largest Catholic population.\n\n\n\n\n\nFilipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, one of Francis's likely successors, would be the first pope from Asia if elected as a result of the conclave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Being a small minority doesn't mean the church is dead. We believe that Jesus is alive, and he was born, and he ministered, and he rose from the dead in Asia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the final years of his life Pope Francis's advocacy for Christians across the world was seen in his calls for peace in Ukraine and his special attention to Palestinian Christians suffering in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the world's oldest churches have been destroyed by Israel's devastating bombardment of the territory amid their war with Hamas.\n\n\n\n\n\nParish priest of Gaza's Catholic Church, father Gabriel Romanelli, praised the late pope for his daily calls of support which he maintained right up until his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, for us, this is a very special day, very sad day, because today died the Pope Francis, he show us his paternity.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 12 years of spiritual leadership over the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis has died at the age of 88.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis death has triggered a mourning period which involves centuries-old rites, some dating back to ancient Rome.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe date of both the funeral and burial will be decided by the Pope's camerlengo, which administers the property and revenues of the Holy See.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe funeral is likely to be held in St Peter's Square four to six days after the death.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will trigger a nine-day mourning period called the 'Novendiale'.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor of Liturgical Studies and Sacramental Theology, Clare Johnson, explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're official days of mourning where masses of suffrage or masses of intercession are prayed each day. So, it's a novena of nine days where the Pope is remembered specifically on each of those days. The funeral itself will be dominated by red, which is the colour of mourning. The challenge of course with celebrating these masses within the season of Easter is that it's a season of joy. So, we've got this kind of contrast between joy and sorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pope had approved funeral protocols for himself last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn typical Franciscan tradition, he opted to cut some of the papal funeral traditions and to simplify some rituals.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of that, his body is to be laid in a single coffin of wood and zinc in the Santa Marta chapel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Previously the Pope would've been buried in three coffins. So, one coffin nested in another coffin, nested in another coffin. Pope Francis has simplified that so that he will be buried just in one zinc lined wooden coffin. He also changed some of the protocols so that there would not be visitation in his private chapel prior to the visitation that will take place \u2013 the public visitation in St. Peter's Basilica where there are three days of visitation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has also elected to buried at Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, rather than the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican \u2013 a choice Professor Johnson says speaks to his humble character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He found that that was a place that he liked to pray before and after he would go on any of his official visits. So, that place obviously has a close affinity for him and really the only thing he wants on his tomb is his name 'Francisco'. I think it's well in keeping with his character, he began his papacy by not wanting to stay in the papal apartment by himself. He wanted to be with the people and I think that's partly what he's done in wanting to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe College of Cardinals will oversee day-to-day business during a period called the 'interregnum' \u2013 during which much of the central Church administration grinds to a halt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat will continue until the election of a successor, which involves a secretive voting ritual.\n\n\n\n\n\nA papal conclave \u2013 involving around 120 cardinals \u2013 will begin in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel between 15 and 20 days after the death.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them: Melbourne-based Cardinal Mykola Bychock, Australia's highest-ranking Catholic.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Miles Pattenden, program director at The Europaeum and a regular commentator on Pope Francis' papacy, explains the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The form and procedure of the conclave has been developed over the course of about 1,000 years, starting back with a papal bull from 1059 In Nomine Domini which said that, you know, the cardinals alone are the men who have the right to elect the pope, but the procedure developed in the subsequent centuries: from the 13th century came the idea that the cardinals need to be locked up in isolation to make this choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAll cardinals under the age of 80 can take part in the secret ballot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey need a majority of at least two-thirds plus one to elect the new pope, so the voting can take several rounds spread over many days.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Pattenden says discussions around a successor have likely been in motion for some time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The church has often oscillated between periods when they've been very relaxed about making a choice and others where they felt a very strong imperative to make it very quickly, and we are in one of those phases at the moment. I think the Catholic Church would lack a great deal of credibility if we were all waiting and it was 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and the cardinals still couldn't reach a consensus. They're very aware of that. So, probably there'll have been a lot of discussions going on already.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the conclave is concluded, the new pope is asked if he accepts and what name he wishes to take.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world learns a pope has been elected when an official burns the paper ballots doused in chemicals to make white smoke pour from the chapel's chimney.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey use other chemicals to make black smoke, which indicates an inconclusive vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Pattenden says that tradition isn't as old as some would initially think.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It dates from the 19th century, and the origin of it, of course, is that the cardinals needed to burn the ballot papers after each ballot so that you didn't find out who had voted for whom. That the outsiders like the Catholic faithful didn't see that there was in fact disagreement amongst the cardinals. They were very concerned to protect the new pope's reputation from that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process of electing a new pope is very political, with power struggles between the traditionalists and the modernisers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his leadership, Pope Francis was considered a progressive reformist, who appointed a record number of non-Europeans as cardinals who will now take part in the voting.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 80 per cent of the current electors were appointed by him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat legacy could make a progressive successor more likely, or for the first time in centuries, the next pope could come from Africa or Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Cardinal Timothy Radcliffe has warned against premature speculation.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "On average, so far, the McLaren has been just over a quarter of a per cent faster than the Red Bull, even if it has taken \u201conly\u201d three poles from six qualifying sessions. That equates to 0.27 seconds on a theoretical one-minute and 40-second lap. Who, though, has been getting the most from their car? Not Norris, whose average qualifying position is 4.67. That is not just below Piastri (2.0) and Verstappen (3.0), but also George Russell (3.5) in a Mercedes. As he said, he is letting himself down and making life (and his championship hopes) harder than it needs to be.\n\nPiastri is yet to qualify worse than third and has four front-row starts compared to Norris, who has started in the top two only twice. In the last two rounds, he has been in grid spots six and 10. Verstappen has two poles and one other front-row start. Maximising lap time Another useful measure of how well a driver is performing over one qualifying lap is whether they are maximising their potential. You can work this out by looking at the difference between a driver\u2019s best lap time and comparing it to their theoretical best \u2013 calculated by totalling a driver\u2019s best three sector times. For instance, a driver may have recorded best sector times of 20.1seconds, 32.5 seconds and 29.4 seconds (1 minute 22 seconds in total) but their best lap time in qualifying could be 1 minute 22.2 seconds, which means they left two-tenths on the table from what they theoretically could have achieved. Looking at the data from the lead trio, it is painfully obvious that Norris trails by this metric. He has put together his theoretical best in the decisive final qualifying period twice. That is the same as Piastri, but one fewer than Verstappen.\n\nOscar Piastri and Lando Norris after the Australian won the Bahrain grand prix. Credit: Getty Images However, dig a little deeper and the picture is worse. His best lap time is on average 0.187 seconds down on his theoretical best, giving away seven-tenths in the Chinese sprint race, 0.147 seconds in qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix and two-tenths in Bahrain. By contrast, Piastri is giving away just 0.061 seconds and Verstappen 0.043 seconds. Piastri has only given away more than a tenth on two occasions, and Verstappen once. Clearly, this has been driven by those well-noted Norris errors. Races There are several metrics you can look at, but again, the lack of quality in the second Red Bull makes any team-mate comparison almost pointless. Away from Verstappen\u2019s utter dominance at Red Bull, Piastri has finished as the lead McLaren in three of the five grands prix.\n\nNorris, though, has the higher average finishing position at McLaren at 2.4 compared to 3.0, excluding the sprint race. That is largely because of Piastri\u2019s ninth-place finish in Australia. Piastri has been the stronger driver since that point. Verstappen\u2019s average finishing position of third, then, is more impressive than both Piastri and Norris. China was a tough race for him (not as tough as Bahrain), but he still extracted close to the maximum from the car. Perhaps the only race he did not maximise the performance of the RB21 was in Saudi Arabia, when he let a lead slip at the start and incurred a five-second time penalty. Looking at laps led, Piastri leads the way with 124, with Verstappen on 66 and then Norris on 60. Of course, it is better to lead the final lap of the race than to have led all of the previous ones. Still, it is clear who is doing better.\n\nWinning margins can be a misleading statistic because there are so many other factors involved such as race and tyre management, as well as safety cars. They provide a decent guide overall, but come with caveats. Of the meaningful races there is only really Verstappen\u2019s 1.4 second-margin in Japan and Piastri\u2019s 15 seconds in Bahrain (after 22 laps of racing) and his 2.8 seconds in Saudi Arabia. Verdict: Verstappen the better driver, Piastri the more likely champion There are other intangible factors that will play a part in the destination of the title in the next 19 rounds. Errors will be one of them, as will mentality and luck, especially if it stays as close as it is. Considering what we have looked at above, we would rate Verstappen as the top-performing driver by a small margin over Piastri. The Dutchman will likely have a battle on his hands to stay in championship contention, though, because of his car. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen. Credit: Getty Images",

There is a sport around putting undue pressure on senior coaches in my view.\u201d Viney pointed out 2025 was the first season where Clarkson hadn\u2019t also been dealing with the fallout from the Hawthorn racism saga.\n\n\u201cNot many clubs can really perform at their best when they\u2019ve got such distractions going on,\u201d Viney continued. \u201c... He\u2019s had enormous distractions, unwarranted criticisms, judged unfairly \u2013 it\u2019s taken an enormous toll on him over those two years. \u201cEventually we\u2019re into this third year, two years and six games in. He\u2019s a rejuvenated person, back to his old self, a lot of energy, seeing the game as well as he\u2019s ever seen it.\u201d Viney was adamant Clarkson was well supported and seeing the game \u201cas well as he ever has\u201d but the Kangaroos were in the early stages of building their game. \u201cThe criticism is really unwarranted,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of a sport, the coach-bashing thing. \u201cIt\u2019s a tall-poppy syndrome which is the Australian culture \u2013 we pick on the guys who have been successful and in time ultimately bring them down.\u201d\n\nLoading Ahead of Saturday\u2019s away clash with Port Adelaide, Viney was adamant the Kangaroos were strong and aligned across the board and wouldn\u2019t deviate from their plans. \u201cA lot of things are going well so we won\u2019t be fractured, we won\u2019t fall into jumping at shadows with all the noise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the game gives us nothing and we need to deserve to win games. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to give us anything and we don\u2019t expect it, we expect to cop our right whack with performances like the weekend. \u201cBut we won\u2019t hear that everything we\u2019re doing is not right because there is a lot of positive things that are going right.\u201d",

    "text": "Still, given the night closed with Ain\u2019t Nobody, not the best song in her repertoire but a perfect mix of slink, simplicity, groove and glee to send \u2019em home happy, there\u2019s a sound engineer who might think he just about got away with this. MUSIC\n\nTOTO WITH CHRISTOPHER CROSS\n\nDarling Harbour Theatre, ICC, April 19\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by James Jennings What to do when you\u2019ve got, say, three songs that are bulletproof crowd-pleasers, yet you\u2019ve been asked to perform a gig that lasts at least an hour or more? Toto in Sydney. Original member Steve Lukather, on guitar, still leads the band. Credit: Ashley Mar If you\u2019re Christopher Cross, a man who could justifiably be credited with creating the genre known as yacht rock (smooth, adult-contemporary music of the late \u201970s and early \u201980s) thanks to his 1980 hit singles Sailing and Ride Like The Wind, you strategically spread them out to one killer track every half an hour. Arthur\u2019s Theme (Best That You Can Do) completes Cross\u2019s crowd-pleasing trifecta.\n\nThe rest of his set is wisely padded out with songs from his hit 1979 self-titled debut album, although a tune he refers to as a \u201cdeep cut\u201d called Dreamers and a new song called You both sound good enough to prove he\u2019s more than just a guy with a few 45-year-old hits. American pop-rock band Toto have a few better-known songs to their name, but the rule of three bulletproof crowd-pleasers applies to them, too. One of those, 1982\u2019s Rosanna, is second cab off the rank and goes down as well as you\u2019d expect, even if only one person on stage \u2013 guitarist and singer Steve Lukather \u2013 is an original Toto member. The seven band members are all masterful musicians, particularly new keyboardist and singer Dennis Atlas, who plays his instrument as if he\u2019s been teleported straight from the \u201980s, even though he\u2019s the youngest by far at 27. Despite the skills on display, some sins are committed: several songs turn into extended jams (always more fun for players than audience; in that vein we also get solos on keyboard (two) and drum). There are a few decent songs along the way such as 99 and I\u2019ll Supply the Love, but more that feel like a chore to get through. It all becomes a bit of an AM radio-friendly soup.\n\nThen, finally, bulletproof, crowd-pleasing redemption: 1978 pop-rock classic Hold the Line livens things up considerably, the perfect entree for Toto\u2019s defining song, 1982\u2019s Africa, which seems to have only increased in popularity as the decades have rolled on thanks to numerous remixes, covers and pop culture references. It\u2019s a glorious note to go out on and makes up for a gig that could have done with a few more songs of the same calibre. MUSIC\n\nSYDNEY PHILHARMONIA CHOIRS\n\nSydney Opera House Concert Hall, April 17\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nReviewed by Harriet Cunningham Sydney Philharmonia Choirs\u2019 Vox and Chamber ensembles have come together with the Australian Romantic and Classical Orchestra (ARCO) to present Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion in the 1841 arrangement of the work by Felix Mendelssohn. St Matthew Passion: the choir responded to conductor Elizabeth Scott with impressive precision and energy. Credit: Keith Saunders\n\nIn the 300 or so years since Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion was first performed, it has undergone myriad transformations: there have been changes in instrumentation, pitch and structure and it has been staged as an opera and a ballet. Mendelssohn\u2019s version, as recreated by ARCO\u2019s team of specialists, is notable for its orchestration. In place of a largely improvised keyboard and viola da gamba continuo, we hear Mendelssohn\u2019s written-out accompaniments for two cellos and bass. In place of the obsolete oboes da caccia, Mendelssohn writes for the new-fangled clarinet and basset horn. At times it feels like a revelation, a radically different palette of tone colours, bringing unfamiliar texture and suspense to the score. At others, it feels like an unfamiliar intrusion, especially when pitch goes awry between historic instruments and contemporary voices. The period interpretation also features romantic styles of rubato, which sound mannered to this modern ear. The Passion is a drama of many characters, some represented by singers, some by instruments. The choristers are particularly versatile, at one moment playing the mob, angry and ready to roar, and at another lulling us into contemplative wonder with a pianissimo chorale. It may be a small army of voices but it responds to conductor Elizabeth Scott with impressive precision and energy.\n\nScott has also assembled an excellent line-up of soloists: Andrew O\u2019Connor plays many roles with consummate skill and Penelope Mills brings fine clarity to the soprano roles, while Emily Edmonds\u2019 mezzo soprano voice is full of warmth. Concertmaster Rachael Beesley and flutist Melissa Farrow bring mellifluous virtuosity to their obligato accompaniments while Teddy Tahu Rhodes shines as a charismatic and eloquent Christus. Finally, the hero of the evening is Andrew Goodwin as the Evangelist, his voice reaching into the heavens with sublime ease. BLUES\n\nGary Clark Jr\n\nEnmore Theatre, April 17\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nReviewed by Bernard Zuel The clue was in his entrance. Long, extravagantly lean and topped by a high, wide and handsomely white hat, Texan Gary Clark Jr ambled on like he was just passing through. He sang of suspicion and resistance: Gary Clark Jnr Credit: Ashley Mar\n\nIt was like purpose was at his disposal \u2013 like time was flexible, elastic even, and to be shaped not so much by will as by example. And it was. Even as the band began playing, a long, atmosphere-heavy introduction was measured in its tempo but deliberately vague in its intentions, all possibilities open. Then this moody, chugging blues emerged and Maktub took shape: decidedly north African in its desert airy expansiveness, it suggested both movement and stasis, with Clark\u2019s slide guitar in long strides rather than stealthy steps. He sang of suspicion and resistance in the tone of someone wearied by the fight but not bent by it; he warned \u201cjust tell \u2019em, we\u2019re coming\u201d but cautioned \u201cwe gotta move in the same direction\u201d, with the patience of someone who has been this way before. And so it went, always undulating rather than surging, for almost 10 minutes, time immaterial. And so it went for the rest of the night: as the hour mark ticked over, Clark and band had only just started on their seventh song. There would be only four more, including an encore, in a show of almost two hours. In that time-defying space, variety was not as pronounced as in his most recent albums, which have seen Clark expand his remit well beyond Texas blues. Still, you could hear echoes of Parliament/Funkadelic in the loose, odd, rhythmically insistent Alone Together, while the hands of Curtis Mayfield and D\u2019Angelo \u2013 old soul and nu-soul - could be felt in R&B-driven numbers like the righteously moved Feed The Babies, the first time Clark\u2019s falsetto emerged.\n\nOne of those predecessors would probably have encouraged Clark to shorten the too-long preamble to the set\u2019s closer, Habits, which seemed a culmination of the noodling that crept in during the final stages of the night and served to speed the exit of some in the audience. But then the man might have responded by pointing out how the Catherine wheel of a solo which climaxed said noodling and the night all but washed away such thoughts \u2013 as if they, like time, didn\u2019t matter. THEATRE\n\nSNAKEFACE\n\nBelvoir Street 25A, April 11\n\nReviewed by HARRIET CUNNINGHAM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAliyah Knight, playwright and performer, is already on stage as the audience files into Belvoir Street\u2019s downstairs theatre and is still there when the lights go up. It feels like there is nowhere else to go. Just a scrim at the back (used to project text, sometimes readable, sometimes censored) and a block of stone \u2013 which turns out to be clay \u2013 centre stage. Music fills up the remaining space, enveloping and energising a young queer figure of colour as they spin, sway and groove.\n\nA coming-of-age story, a myth, a fever dream and a mystery: Snakeface is written and performed by Aliyah Knight. Credit: Abraham de Souza, Fruit Box Theatre Snakeface is many things: a coming-of-age story, a myth, a fever dream and a mystery. Its title references the murderous, snake-haired Medusa of Greek myth. Knight\u2019s imagination transforms Medusa into a victim, made into a monster by sexual violence. This becomes a springboard into the mind and body of a woman whose transformation is anything but mythical. Loading There\u2019s a gritty, joyful authenticity about much of Knight\u2019s script, which captures the wide-eyed curiosity and liminal sensation of a life-hungry teenager. They watch two beads of sweat running down a naked man\u2019s chest and wonder which wins the race; they catch eyes with a stranger in a bar and hallucinate with pleasure. There\u2019s poetry in the prose of the young woman\u2019s words, and it clashes with the ugly words jumping out from the poetry projected on the backdrop. Knight delivers it all with fluency, flipping from chatter to chant in a sustained monologue, which I would be fascinated to read.",

    "text": "A huge school of salmon at a beach west of Albany made for an exciting day of fishing on Easter Sunday. Source: Farhan Kerbelker\n\nExcited fishers are flocking to the southwest of the country to chase an unprecedented salmon run with witnesses saying they \"haven't seen anything like it\".\n\nLarge schools of huge salmon arrived in time for the Easter holiday in the south of Western Australia. The fish are moving in big numbers along the beaches of Albany, making their way around the capes and up the west coast of the country.\n\nAvid fisherman and photographer Farhan Kerbelker was among the thousands chasing the salmon over Easter. It is something he does this time every year, but he's never seen a season like this one and he captured some incredible drone footage of a school of salmon near Albany on Sunday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Everyone is finding the size of the salmon much bigger than normal,\" Farhan told Yahoo News on Monday. \"We've not seen anything like it.\"\n\nAs a result holidays parks in the south over Easter were bursting at the seams with people after a piece of the action, and with the Anzac Day long weekend just days away the crowds chasing the fish will again take over the coastal towns in the southwest of WA.\n\n\"You can't get accommodation, people are camping anywhere, it's fully booked up,\" Farhan said.\n\nSwirling salmon ball off WA beach stuns campers\n\nOn Sunday the Perth-based fisherman was at a remote beach west of Albany with a group of friends just hooking the odd salmon straying from its school when the day changed suddenly.\n\n\"We saw this little bit of a dark patch in front us, and no one thought much of it as it was pretty weedy,\" Farhan explained.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I sent the drone up and I saw this ball swirling and immediately we knew it was a school. The whole beach shouted for everyone just to go to follow the school.\"\n\nA pod of dolphins chased the salmon towards the beach and then the school just parked in a channel close to the shore. From that point it was on \u2014 people were casting whatever they had, using lures and trying to pull the huge fish in.\n\n\"I had to stop because my arms and wrists were sore,\" Farhan said. Using 12-pound lines the group were snapping lines and bending hooks, so they had to change to a 30lb lines just to get the fish out of the water.\n\nWhen Farhan was too exhausted to continue he relaunched his drone to capture the scene including spectacular vision of the ball of salmon just off the shore.\n\nThe school of salmon resembled a swirling black ball. Source: Farhan Kerbelker.\n\nThe school of salmon were pushed to the shore by dolphins. Source: Farhan Kerbelker.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe footage was shared on social media where many anglers shared their excitement of seeing the salmon and their efforts to successfully land the huge fish.\n\nThe Easter weekend frenzy follows similar scenes recently shared around the southwest of WA including a day at Cheynes Beach earlier in the month when there were so many salmon that fishers were pulling them out of the water by hand.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
