You can't let them fall apart,\" Mr Tarr said.\n\n\"We've got it up to a reasonable standard and probably got another 100 years in it.\"\n\nOnce a busy hub, Beltana\u2019s railway station now stands as a reminder of the town\u2019s past.

We know how important transparency is to the industry,\" Mr Rockliff said in the statement. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nOn Sunday, the minority Liberal party announced it would launch an independent review into the troubled industry.\n\nPremier Jeremy Rockliff said the review would support the salmon industry \"to operate transparently and responsibly\" and \"meet its social licence\".\n\n\"I said clearly, after the mass mortality event of last summer, the industry is on notice,\" Mr Rockliff said in a statement.\n\nCrossbenchers wield influence in Tasmania\u2019s new political order Photo shows Two men at press conferences wear suits and stand outside.

The prestige of the Australian National University is fast fading.\n\nTEQSA began investigating compliance concerns at ANU in October 2024, but did not commence its formal compliance assessment until June.\n\nIts investigation had initially been limited to assessing ANU's Nixon Review and its proposed staff cuts, along with grades in the ANU School of Cybernetics.\n\nThe letter outlined its investigation had been expanded to include \"broader risks to compliance\" including the culture of the ANU Council and executive leadership, and oversight of its financial position.\n\n\"Further information has been considered which suggests there are broader potential risks to compliance that require assessment by TEQSA,\" the letter said.\n\nSeveral concerns identified\n\nTEQSA's letter spelled out issues such as staff afraid to voice concerns about decisions by senior leadership, the management of staff cuts, the internal culture of the ANU Council and leadership, and poor accountability of workplace practices.\n\nVice-Chancellor Genevieve Bell is one of the 15 members on ANU Council. (ABC News: Tiger Webb)\n\nThe letter, authored by TEQSA CEO Mary Russell, also specified fears about the ANU Council's oversight of the university's financial position, which included the institution's pursuit to find $250 million in savings by 2026.\n\n\"Whilst steps are being taken to address ANU's current financial position, it was under the ANU Council's oversight that ANU reached a position that now requires it to reduce recurring expenditure by $250 million,\" the letter said.\n\n\" It is unclear if the ANU Council has identified and addressed potential risks that led to this financial position and whether these potential risks persist. \"\n\nOn Tuesday, ANU was forced to respond to allegations that council members, including Chancellor Julie Bishop, had threatened, harassed and bullied staff-elected council member Dr Liz Allen.\n\nLiz Allen accused ANU Council members of bullying during a Senate inquiry hearing on Tuesday.

(ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"What we want is the premier to drop this 'world-class' line,\" Australian Medical Association WA president Kyle Hoath said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We want the premier to acknowledge that there is a problem with our health system, that our hospitals are on their knees, and that we need to work together to fix this.\n\n\"We need investment in our hospitals, not just new beds, but to make sure that our existing hospitals don't fall to pieces.\"\n\nKyle Hoath said WA's hospitals were in need of significant investment. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nOn Thursday, opposition health spokeswoman Libby Mettam used question time to claim the government's own figures showed it had only added 118 hospital beds in metropolitan Perth between 2018 and May 2025 \u2014 far below the 863 beds it claimed to have added.\n\n\"The number of available beds in the system will change over the course of the day,\" Health Minister Meredith Hammat attempted to explain over the opposition's interjections.\n\nMeredith Hammat defended the state government's investment in WA's hospitals. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"The reasons it might change, for example, are because a patient has been discharged and that room needs to be cleaned before another patient can use it. It may be that some maintenance is potentially required for one of those beds.\n\n\"This is why the more accurate measure is to count the number of beds that have been added through infrastructure upgrades.\"\n\nA world-class system?\n\nWhile a common understanding of the issue might have proved elusive, there was a marked change in language.\n\nOn Tuesday, the premier told parliament the health system was \"world-class\" four times.\n\nThe following day, Health Infrastructure Minister John Carey also used the term.\n\nOn Thursday, no ministers used the description.\n\nJohn Carey hasn't ruled out additional funding for Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. (ABC News: James Carmody)\n\n\"Every minister in every portfolio advocates for more funding,\" Carey told reporters that day.\n\n\"I do anticipate that we will have to make further investment in Charlies.\"\n\nBut the government is not writing the health system a blank cheque, with Treasurer Rita Saffioti pointing out on Thursday \"there's always unlimited wants, unlimited demand\" for taxpayers' money.\n\n\"And so it's always trying to make sure you can deliver increased funding and getting improvements,\" she said, pointing to $110 million of investment at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital alone.\n\nThe West Australian newspaper has published a series of articles exposing problems in the state's health system. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nOn the face of it, it's a fair enough comment for a government to make. Not every funding request it received can be accommodated.\n\nBut it's a trickier argument to make when the state budget is $2.4 billion in surplus, and the question is whether health spending should be increased.\n\nHave something to share with the ABC's WA newsroom? Photo shows Perth City and Claisebrook Cove Whether it's an image, video, story, or tip-off, you can send it to the ABC's West Australian newsroom here.\n\nOnly six months into this term of government, the opposition has honed in on health as a weak point for the government, and one it will almost certainly continue to prosecute relentlessly.\n\nIt's a tricky one for the government to counter, given the web of systems and services run by state and federal authorities in an increasingly complex space with no easy answers.\n\nWhen the next election is held in 2029, the opposition may well have convinced the public of the severity of problems \u2014 but they'll have to do a lot more to prove they have the solutions needed to turn things around.\n\nLoading...",

I'm proud of just everyone down the line contributing today,\" he said.\n\nEvery Boomers player got on the scoreboard in a performance that showcased depth, discipline and dominance.\n\nJack McVeigh led the way with 17 points and three triples, while Harry Wessels had 16 and Hickey 14 as Australia dominated proceedings in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHickey added six rebounds and as many assists in an all-around display, while Wessels provided a steady defensive presence.\n\nOwen Foxwell set the tone early with steals and a key three-pointer, and Jack White delivered highlight-reel slams to keep the energy high.\n\nFor Iran, Sina Vahedi top-scored with 11 points including two triples, while Mobin Sheikhi had eight points, four rebounds and three assists.\n\nStar forward Mohammad Amini was limited to just two points on 1-of-9 shooting as the Boomers' defence smothered his usual offensive spark.\n\nAustralia weathered Iran's early shots in the first quarter, answering with back-to-back triples from McVeigh and Reyne Smith plus a technical foul free throw to close the period up 27-20.\n\nOwen Foxwell hit a big three-pointer to help send the Boomers on their way to the Asia Cup final with a win over Iran.

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nIf the first half had Iran scrambling, the third quarter finished the job.\n\nMcVeigh's quick five points, punishing runs from Hickey and Wessels, and relentless defensive pressure resulted in a staggering 29-8 frame that pushed the margin to 80-37.\n\nBy the time Joshua Bannan's corner triple dropped, the game was long decided.\n\nThe final quarter was about managing minutes and maintaining focus, with Wessels continuing to score inside and Australia's defence ensuring Iran never threatened.\n\nThe Boomers' balanced attack, rim protection and transition efficiency proved too much for Iran's young Team Melli, still finding their identity after earlier comeback wins in the tournament.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Bindi Irwin is urging women not to accept endometriosis pain as normal.\n\nThe 27-year-old's post on social media in 2023 detailing her diagnosis with endometriosis has been liked more than one million times.\n\nThis week, Ms Irwin stated that after 13 years of fighting for answers, 51 endometriosis lesions, a cyst, two surgeries, and a hernia, it was now time to heal.\n\nShe said she felt \"utterly ashamed\" of her pain as her endometriosis symptoms were constantly dismissed.\n\nLike many women, Ms Irwin said this eroded her self-esteem, and she was speaking out to help reduce the stigma and secrecy around discussing the condition.\n\nNot just a woman's issue\n\nEndometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other parts of the body.\n\nAbout one in 10 of those assigned female at birth have endometriosis.\n\nEbony Nykiel, 26, from Queensland's Sunshine Coast, said Bindi's post resonated with her.\n\nShe said it took 13 years for her diagnosis of endometriosis.\n\nEbony Nykiel, 26, from the Sunshine Coast, lives with endometriosis. (Supplied)\n\nMs Nykiel said she had her first period at 10, and from the start, her painful symptoms were dismissed by others.\n\nHer eventual diagnosis was \"bittersweet\".\n\nShe said it was validating to learn she \"wasn't crazy\" but that she was left with limited treatment options.\n\nMs Nykiel said it wasn't just a woman's issue. \"It's everyone's issue,\" she said.\n\nChange 'on a global scale'\n\nMs Irwin said she was \"slowly, slowly\" regaining her strength.\n\n\"I can FINALLY (sic) say that I'm feeling better. Genuinely healing. I can function in everyday life without wanting to throw up or pass out from the pain,\" she wrote on social media.\n\n\"I cannot express the gravity of my emotions as I am beginning to recognise myself again.\n\nBindi Irwin with husband Chandler Powell and daughter Grace. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\n\"I felt utterly ashamed as a teenager and young adult being told that my pain was just part of being a woman.\n\n\"I felt lesser. I felt hurt. I felt weak.\"\n\nShe said others should not have to endure isolation along with the trauma caused by endometriosis.\n\n\"Young girls and women shouldn't feel alone with pain in the driver's seat of their lives,\" Ms Irwin said.\n\n\"We need to take away the stigma of talking about women's health. It's time to have open discussions and make change on a global scale.\"\n\nBindi Irwin with brother Robert. (Instagram: @robertirwinphotography)\n\nEndometriosis doesn't discriminate\n\nJessica Spain, a social worker and PhD candidate at the University of the Sunshine Coast, is researching the experiences of women and girls in regional Queensland accessing an endometriosis diagnosis.\n\nShe said it was \"so common\" for them to be dismissed or for their pain to be normalised, misdiagnosed, or mistreated.\n\nMiss Spain said it could take six to eight years to be diagnosed.\n\nAccessing care, she said, was even more challenging for those who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, transgender, non-binary, living with a disability, or in a regional area.\n\nJessica Spain says it takes too long to get diagnosed. (Supplied: Jessica Spain)\n\n\"The stigma around it has kept women under wraps for hundreds and thousands of years,\" she said.\n\n\"Females are the experts in their own bodies and we know when something's wrong.\"\n\nShe said women were often told they were being dramatic or that it was stress-related.\n\n\" Everything under the sun is thrown out as a diagnosis instead of considering that it could be endometriosis. \"\n\nMiss Spain said she found Ms Irwin's post empowering.\n\n\"Endometriosis doesn't discriminate,\" Miss Spain said.\n\n\"It's so powerful for her to speak up about that because that will resonate with so many people.\"\n\n'People can thrive'\n\nMonica Forlano, from Endometriosis Australia, said it was a full-body and potentially lifelong health condition.\n\nMonica Forlano, chair of Endometriosis Australia. (Supplied: Endometriosis Australia)\n\nShe said, historically, the female body was not studied in the same way as men's bodies.\n\n\"It essentially just comes down to medical misogyny,\" she said.\n\n\"We know so little about it, it's still a mystery, an enigma.\"\n\nShe said that through more funding, research, and awareness, the future was likely brighter for those living with the disease.\n\nMs Forlano said she hoped to see endometriosis discussed more widely in schools with boys and girls of all ages.\n\n\"It shouldn't be a life-defining condition. People can thrive,\" Ms Forlano said.\n\n\"They just need to be seen and heard and listened to.\"",

(ABC News: Tavleen Singh)\n\nHe has since exhibited in galleries around the world, gaining prominence for mural paintings and public artworks in countries including Italy, France, Japan and Germany.\n\nTsuri said a big appeal of painting in public was the accessibility it gave to artwork.\n\n\"I believe art is quite important and a valuable thing for anyone and everyone, but if you are not working in a public space, say in traditional museums or art galleries, then the audience who comes to see your work is only the people who are actually interested in this kind of stuff,\" he said.\n\n\"When you are painting in a public space, you encounter pretty much anyone and everyone who lives in that area.\n\n\"I definitely take something from everywhere that I go when I make a public work.\n\n\"I really feel like it's an exchange, it's not just me leaving my mark.\"\n\nOne of the art cubes worked on as part of the project. (ABC News: Danielle Pope)\n\nMentoring rural creatives\n\nTsuri said he was drawn to the project as it was an opportunity to work with the next generation of artists.\n\n\"This project was a bit more special because it was asking to do a mentorship program with the local creatives and as much as I love painting public murals myself, I think I see sharing my ideas and skills and experiences that I gather along the world with other people is quite an important part of my practice,\" he said.\n\nEileen Tanaka was one of the participants chosen for the program.\n\nHaving studied art at school, her love for painting has become a hobby.\n\n\"The first day we started was terrible, it just poured for like two hours straight, so we had to go home early,\" Ms Tanaka said.\n\n\"But I guess it doesn't really matter, it affects the art in a way where it kind of makes it better because of the dripping.\n\nEileen Tanaka was one of the participants in the mentorship program. (ABC News: Danielle Pope)\n\n\" You don't really often get a chance to legally paint on a wall like this so it's pretty exciting. \"\n\nShe said the chance to work with someone of Tsuri's standard who also shared a Japanese background was a special opportunity.\n\n\"We don't have many Japanese artists around here, so having someone who has the same interests as me and is doing so well in the field and has decided to come to Gippsland \u2026 is really exciting,\" she said.\n\nEileen Tanaka and Riam Chilver have been working with Hiroyasu Tsuri. (ABC News: Danielle Pope)\n\nFellow student Riam Chilver said he loved learning new painting techniques.\n\nHe said more opportunities to engage young artists in the region would be beneficial.\n\n\"I think it would be really cool to have more mentorship kind of programs and a lot of collaborating as well on murals and public art,\" he said.",

    "text": "Glenn Maxwell has produced some trademark big show heroics to lead Australia to a series-deciding two-wicket T20 International win over South Africa in Cairns.\n\nChasing South Africa's 7-172, Australia were cruising at 2-83 on the back of Mitch Marsh's 54 off 37 balls before disaster struck.\n\nAustralia lost 4-37 to put the contest back in the balance and it was anyone's game with the hosts still needing 27 runs off the final three overs.\n\nA chaotic beamer from paceman Kagiso Rabada \u2014 which sailed two metres above Maxwell's head \u2014 at the start of the 18th over was one big turning point.\n\nMaxwell thumped his free hit for six, and it looked set to be a piece of cake once the equation got whittled down to 12 runs needed from 12 balls with four wickets still in hand.\n\nThere was more drama to come, with Corbin Bosch (3-26) dismissing Ben Dwarshuis and Nathan Ellis in consecutive deliveries to catapult South Africa back into the clash.\n\nTen runs were needed off the final over, and it became four runs required off the last two balls.\n\nMaxwell kept his cool in the heat of the moment, employing a reverse whack to thump Lungi Ngidi's hip-high full toss for four to seal victory with one ball to spare.\n\nThe win secured a 2-1 T20I series victory for Australia ahead of the ODI series.\n\n\"It was a little bit nerve wracking,\" Maxwell said.\n\n\"We were down to two wickets and I knew I had to do the majority of the striking. It was nice to get a couple out of the middle right near the end.\n\n\"We've had a great run with this T20 group, so to have another series win against a quality opposition in South Africa is great for our confidence heading forward.\n\n\"I think there's another 13 or 14 internationals before the T20 World Cup, and we're building something really nicely at the moment in this group.\"\n\nEarlier, Aaron Hardie felt the full brunt of the latest onslaught from Dewald Brevis as South Africa posted 7-172.\n\nBrevis was the hero of South Africa's game-two win, cracking an unbeaten 125 off 56 balls to level the series at 1-1.\n\nThe 22-year-old was at it again on Saturday night, thumping 53 off 26 balls before being sent packing by a diving Maxwell catch in the deep.\n\nBrevis signalled his intent early in his innings by pulling Dwarshuis (0-37) onto the Cazalys Stadium roof.\n\nBut it was the 10th over \u2014 bowled by Hardie \u2014 when Brevis went into overdrive.\n\nAfter a dot ball was followed by a two, Brevis proceeded to hit four consecutive sixes from the next four legal deliveries.\n\nThe first six \u2014 over cover \u2014 bounced onto the roof and out of the stadium.\n\nBrevis sent his next six straight down the ground, with a crowd member crashing to the ground after running into a fence while trying to take a catch.\n\nThe next Hardie delivery was also sent straight down the ground \u2014 this time with no crowd injury \u2014 before the fourth was cut over cover.\n\nA total of 27 runs was taken from the Hardie over leaving South Africa well placed at 3-96 after 10 overs and 3-108 after 11.\n\nMaxwell's diving catch in the deep to dismiss Brevis proved to be a huge turning point with South Africa restricted to 62 runs from the final 8.2 overs.\n\nEllis finished with 3-31 off four overs, while leg spinner Adam Zampa was the most economical with 2-24 from his four overs.\n\nThe Australian team wore black armbands to pay tribute to former Australia Test captain and coach Bob Simpson who has died at the age of 89.\n\nA minute's silence was held before the game began.\n\nAAP",

(ABC News: Roxanne Fitzgerald)\n\nOver the past six months, two Darwin businesses have been left with tonnes of tyres and a massive clean-up bill after falling victim to a tyre dumping scheme that has impacted people across Australia.\n\n\"Everything seemed to be 100 per cent genuine about [the workers sharing our yard],\" Mr Albatat said.\n\n\"They hired people \u2026 they had their own truck.\n\n\"But slowly, slowly we start to realise they were not coming here anymore.\n\n\" Alarms start to come up and we start to ask, 'What's exactly happening with these guys?' \"\n\nMr Albatat said at the beginning of the year, his landlord rented out a portion of the yard to a new tyre recycling company called Seoul Traders, which needed space to store and recycle tyres.\n\nThe Darwin business owner says the stack of abandoned tyres has left him with a costly clean-up bill. (ABC News: Roxanne Fitzgerald)\n\nProperty owner Peter Kruhse said the NT Environment Protection Authority (EPA) had granted the company a licence to recycle tyres on a commercial basis, which was a requirement under Northern Territory law.\n\n\"At first, they paid rent on time,\" the landlord said.\n\n\"Then, they pretended to pay it and they'd send me screenshots of payments \u2026 and eventually they disappeared.\"\n\nHe said phone calls went unanswered when he tried to chase them up, and he wasn't able to track the tenants down.\n\n\"It was a nightmare. I slogged in the sun for a month packing the tyres into stacks,\" Mr Kruhse said.\n\n\" No one should have to go through this heartache. \"\n\nThe scam targets businesses with stacks of worn tyres, offering discounted recycling services.\n\nOperators collect their payment, but then abandon the tyres at rented lots or backyards and vanish with the cash.\n\nThe property's landlord said he \"slogged in the sun for a month\" stacking the discarded tyres. (ABC News: Roxanne Fitzgerald)\n\nOperator suspended\n\nIn May, interstate authorities alerted the NT Environment Protection Authority (EPA) to the scam after it had taken place in other jurisdictions \u2014 sparking an investigation.\n\nThe EPA went to the site to carry out an inspection on Seoul Traders, and found it was breaching a number of licence conditions.\n\nIn June, the EPA suspended their licence.\n\nRecycling tyres in the NT is an expensive process, despite a growing overseas market for the shredded rubber and steel. (ABC News: Roxanne Fitzgerald)\n\n\"Seoul Traders was granted an environment protection licence in March,\" a spokesperson told the ABC.\n\n\" At the time of granting the licence, the NT EPA had no intelligence about an alleged scam being run. \"\n\nThe spokesperson said the EPA checks the business records of applicants and asks if they have held licences or committed environmental offences previously, and Seoul Traders met the basic ASIC requirements to get an ABN and operate in Australia.\n\nIn 2020, thousands of old tyres were illegally dumped at vacant land lots and in the backyards of rented homes across Western Australia, prompting authorities to issue warnings about the scam.\n\nFooting the clean-up bill\n\nMr Kruhse estimated the company left around 50 tonnes of tyres on his Darwin lot, which could cost him over $30,000 to dispose of.\n\nIn May, NTEX \u2014 a legitimate recycling company in Darwin \u2014 was also targeted.\n\nPaul Wilson, the company's facility manager, said the scammers organised to pay for around 20 tonnes of tyres to be recycled.\n\nPaul Wilson, from NTEX, says an initial check of the scammer's credentials didn't show any cause for concern. (ABC News: Roxanne Fitzgerald)\n\nHe said NTEX also checked the company's credentials and found there was \"no reason to question this particular client\".\n\nBut after the tyres were dropped off, NTEX never heard from them again, and the bill was never paid.\n\nMr Wilson said after numerous attempts to contact the company, NTEX decided to take the tyres back to the address they had on file: Mr Kruhse's property where Anwar Albatat makes his tiny homes.\n\nAnwar Albatat and Peter Wilson estimate up to 50 tonnes of tyres were left for them to clean up. (ABC News: Roxanne Fitzgerald)\n\nRecycling tyres in the NT is an expensive and complex process, despite the growing overseas market for the shredded rubber and steel.\n\nIt now costs more than $1,000 for a commercial business to dispose of a tonne of tyres at the NT's main waste facility, and there are only a few cheaper options like NTEX, which charges $610 per tonne.\n\nMr Wilson said the steep rise in costs had led to a surge in illegal tyre dumping across Australia.\n\n\"There is money to be made and I could certainly understand the appetite of scammers to be in that particular scam,\" he said.",

In marrying Brecht\u2019s poetry of displacement with fragmented reminiscences of the Viennese modernism with which many musical refugees would have been familiar, Millikin has created an evocative meditation on loss and new beginnings. The empathetic narration by the composer\u2019s sister Angie Milliken alternated between English and German, underlining a loss of belonging.\n\nAt the heart of the program was Beethoven\u2019s String Quartet in C major, Op. 59, No. 3. The vastly different timbres of the first two chords signalled that this would be an engrossing account. Indeed, it riveted listeners for some 30 minutes. Loading After the initial brilliance of C major, it was hard not to swoon to the ensuing Andante, beautifully underpinned by Andr\u00e1s Fej\u00e9r\u2019s cello. A vividly contrasted Menuetto led directly into the fugato finale, taken at breakneck speed and overflowing with energy and excitement. A generous encore, the second movement of Ravel\u2019s String Quartet, captivated not only with its exquisite elegance but with the most luscious pizzicato anyone could hope to hear this side of the pearly gates. Such heavenly music making really does put the Tak\u00e1cs Quartet in a class of its own.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nElevator Music \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nOmega Ensemble, Melbourne Recital Centre, August 16 Despite the tenuous link between elevators and this Omega Ensemble program, most of the music seemed to be chosen to lift listeners\u2019 spirits. Loading Elevator Music is the title of a jazz-infused work by Adelaide-based composer Graeme Koehne, which (confusingly) was not performed. Keohne, however, provided a new work for orchestra and two clarinets to showcase the talents of English virtuoso Michael Collins and Omega\u2019s artistic director David Rowden. Dances on the Edge of Time (a title derived from poetry by Rabindranath Tagore) consists of three movements (a rigaudon, a chaconne and a gigue), each tagged with a phrase from the popular aphorism attributed to baseballer Leroy \u201cSatchel\u201d Paige: \u201cWork like you don\u2019t need the money, love like you\u2019ve never been hurt and dance like nobody\u2019s watching.\u201d\n\nCollins and Rowden, along with the rest of the ensemble, willingly followed Paige\u2019s advice. Surmounting a buoyant rhythmic accompaniment, the ascending solo lines of the Rigaudon radiated a carefree approach. Classic gestures in the chaconne spoke of loss then love, while the concluding gigue hinted at the rustic style of Australian musical larrikin Percy Grainger. Koehne\u2019s concerto was preceded by the instantly recognisable Allegro from Mozart\u2019s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, whose jollity stood in stark contrast to Stride by American composer Anna Clyne. Drawing material from Beethoven\u2019s Pathetique Sonata, Clyne\u2019s often busy and astringent soundscape created episodes of tension and release. Originally written for swing jazz legend Benny Goodman, Aaron Copland\u2019s Clarinet Concerto, with its masterly writing for both orchestra and soloist, was brilliantly executed by Collins. Effortlessly negotiating its melodious languor and its infectious rhythmic energy, Collins happily and vividly brought the music alive in time and space. Arranged for two clarinets, the final movement from Elena Kats-Chernin\u2019s Ornamental Air proved the perfect encore, taking the mood, as it were, to the top floor.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nPress Club \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nCorner Hotel, August 8 \u201cYou should see the piece of skin hanging off my shin,\u201d says Press Club singer Natalie Foster of the blood trickling down her leg, just four songs in. \u201cIt scared me. I\u2019ve only seen that once before when I was 18 and fell off a construction site drinking tequila.\u201d Press Club perform at the Corner Hotel on Friday, August 8. Credit: Martin Philbey This banter could be a manifesto for her jangly, garage-punk quartet. Misadventures and big emotions, testing limits and returning home to report on them: they\u2019re key themes throughout the Brunswick group\u2019s catalogue. Since their debut in 2017, the staunchly DIY Press Club have been on a tear \u2013 stomping across world stages and releasing four LPs in quick succession. Tonight they\u2019re launching their latest, the sugary punk sheen of To All the Ones I Love. It also makes for an emotional homecoming, laced with a slight hint of exhaustion, to close the band\u2019s 10-week, 30-date European and Australian tour.\n\nFollowing a walk-on to the moody I Am Everything, Press Club throw everything at it. \u201cWe\u2019re from Melbourne,\u201d says Foster before a blistering Cancelled. \u201cFeels f---ing good to be playing our hometown.\u201d The gig served as both an album launch and an emotional homecoming for the band. Credit: Martin Philbey The celebratory Headwreck ignites the first singalong, and from there it\u2019s over to Foster to pull focus \u2013 be it via bloody injuries or her incredible voice, which retains its husky, impeccably roaring croon even when she\u2019s mid-headbang, pulling a handstand mid-verse of Coward Street, or lost deep in the crowd. Around her the band sizzles on Greg Rietwyk\u2019s relentlessly melodic guitar lines, Iain MacRae\u2019s excellent burbling bass and the breakneck drumming of Timmy Hansen, filling in for founding member Frank Lees, who\u2019s on parental leave. Dynamics of a punk show can be tricky \u2013 if every song allegedly inspires catharsis, after a while the stakes don\u2019t seem as high. Press Club mitigate this with clever stylistic detours. Mid-show highlight Untitled Wildlife features Stu Patterson from support band Placement lend wailing saxophone to an indie-rock build that culminates in real anthemic alchemy. Suburbia, from the band\u2019s debut, Late Teens, remains the perfect set closer, Foster yelling, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to letting all your dreams go\u201d, while instructing the crowd to launch themselves one last time.\n\nBack for an encore, Foster takes the dying minute of joyous, Smiths-y closer Wilt to jump into the crowd and make her way over to help out at the merchandise desk. As we file out, she\u2019s there keeping the dream alive.\n\nReviewed by Marcus Teague DANCE\n\nPhantasm \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nChunky Move Studios, until August 16 The title of Melanie Lane\u2019s new show suggests a singular, self-contained vision. In the event, however, it unfolds as a plurality of figments and counterfeits drawn from the archives of popular culture with only the loosest thematic connection. The setting is impressive. Working with designers Eugyeene Teh and Bosco Shaw, Lane constructs a wonderfully gothic space enclosed by solid walls of darkness, filled with haze and crossed with scrims. Phantasm takes place in a wonderfully gothic space. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti\n\nA lone dancer drops into this lowermost dungeon of the mind. She bites the head off a rat, blood running over her chin, then jerks and twitches, hands vibrating like a plucked string. It\u2019s a strong opening, with the promise of something visceral, bloody and unexpected: a feminine nexus of death, desire and horror, darkly animate. Yet little of this intensity carries through the rest of the work. Phantasm, the title of Melanie Lane\u2019s new show, suggests a singular, self-contained vision. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti We move through predictable variations: exotic dancers, demonic cheerleaders, gothic heroines, romantic ballerinas, witches on broomsticks. Some, like the witches suspended above the stage, are more interesting than others. They are all, however, fairly generic images. They\u2019re types or figures, mythic only in the rather desolate sense that they are overexposed: tropes of femininity endlessly adapted and exploited by mass culture.\n\nWe rely on the movement to give these figures new relevance, and to provide the thread that might bind them into a collective phantasm. This doesn\u2019t happen. Instead, the dance often settles into familiarity. Costumes are exiguous and change often: witches\u2019 rags give way to tinselled cheer skirts, then tutus. Only mushroom-coloured bodystockings remain constant, giving, at a squint, the illusion of nudity. Loading In the final scene, the bodystocking is also stripped away. The setting shifts to a primeval forest where the women exchange gestures of care. The implication seems to be that this is the real myth behind the others: a return to some essentialised, pastoral femininity. I\u2019m not convinced. This image of the natural woman seems just as constructed and just as overexposed as the others. Does Lane really intend this as a return to the body in its purest form? Surely this is just another costume to be sloughed?",

But there was one thing she wasn\u2019t worried about: the food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were cooking the same as I was cooking at home,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMagdalena, who turns 100 next week, is a resident at \u00c1rp\u00e1d \u2014 a 62-bed Hungarian aged care facility in Melbourne\u2019s east. On the menu is a range of Hungarian specialties including sz\u00e9kelyk\u00e1poszta (sauerkraut goulash), h\u00fasleves (a clear broth soup with beef or chicken and vegetables), and t\u00far\u00f3s csusza (pasta with cottage cheese and fried bacon on top). On special occasions, they will indulge in p\u00e1linka, a Hungarian-style schnapps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I eat it all,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSitting by her side, Eva Paldy, 88, explains that Christmas feasts at the facility are an especially exciting time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's absolutely beautiful,\" she says, listing the strudels and pastries that are prepared for the holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Are you getting hungry?\"\n\n\n\nAt Christmas, the Hungarian chef at \u00c1rp\u00e1d Aged Care prepares beigli, a sweet bread with poppy seed or walnut filling. Source: Supplied / \u00c1rp\u00e1d Aged Care In Australia, around 185,00 people aged 65 and over are currently living in residential aged care facilities across the country. Despite improvements to aged care facilities following the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, rates of malnutrition are still high, with one 2024 study from Griffith and Monash Universities suggesting four in 10 residents are still not getting enough nutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as our diverse population ages, there is growing awareness that culturally appropriate food can make a significant contribution to improving rates of malnutrition, while also increasing overall wellbeing and quality of life.\n\n\n\nMeals that spark joy\n\nIn 2021, the royal commission stated that access to adequate food is a fundamental human right. Its final report identified food quality as a key problem requiring immediate attention, citing one Victorian study that found 68 per cent of homes surveyed had residents who were malnourished or at risk of malnourishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCherie Hugo is the founder of Lantern Alliance, which is dedicated to improving the quality of life for older Australians through food. She says that four years on from the report, and despite many positive government initiatives driving improvement in the sector, the problem of malnutrition is still \"way bigger than it should be\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's so many reasons why malnutrition is important. It increases health complications. It increases the risk of fall by eight times. It increases pressure injuries, hospitalisations, infections and cognitive decline,\" she says.\n\n\n\nHugo says budget constraints play a role, as does a lack of training for kitchen staff. But one overlooked factor is how dietary requirements change as we get older.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"An older person's protein needs are on par with what you would see for an athlete. But the problem that also happens as we get older is our appetites decrease. So the problem is they're needing more protein, but not feeling as hungry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue was highlighted this week by Maggie Beer at a speech given at the National Press Club. The famous former chef was inspired to start the Maggie Beer Foundation to advocate for improved nutrition after visiting a number of facilities where she was \"often appalled\" by the food that was served there.\n\n\n\nFormer chef Maggie Beer spoke at the National Press Club on Wednesday where she described seeing \"appalling\" food being served in some aged care facilities. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas \"What was missing was not only the joy in food, but the real belief in most places that beautiful food will make such a difference to the wellbeing of residents and pride of the teams,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeer said that some of the best food she's eaten in aged care facilities were ones with strong links to countries with vibrant food cultures, such as the Italian, Greek and Vietnamese communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo agrees that enjoyable food that connects with a person's cultural identity is a \"huge uplift to resident satisfaction\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Food is a reflection of identity, it triggers memories, particularly when you have residents living with dementia. It's something that can bring that spark back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents are also more likely to finish a meal and subsequently not lose weight, which Hugo says is crucial to older people's overall health as they age.\n\n\n\nMore than meatballs\n\nTasty and culturally appropriate food can bring other benefits too.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile living in an Italian-focused aged care facility during her PhD research, Hugo saw that a successful meal was about more than its nutritional content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember having a meatball dish that was just delicious. But the thing that hit me was that often in an aged care space, it\u2019s not a noisy space. But what really struck me at this one home were the animated conversations in Italian.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appeared people were shouting at each other but Hugo discovered it was a heated debate about what constitutes the perfect meatball recipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The food is there to nourish, but there's that social connection too. It's a social lubricant if you have a great meal or you see the menu displayed and people get excited, that in itself elicits conversation,\" she says.\n\n\n\nA traditional Hungarian sz\u00e9kelyk\u00e1poszta or sauerkraut goulash, where the fermented cabbage is cooked with the meat and served with a dollop of sour cream on top.

Magdalena says that her daughter will often join her for dinner so they can enjoy the food together. They are planning to do so again next week for her 100th birthday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She has said to me she likes to come here and eat because it feels like being back home, like the restaurants in Budapest.\"\n\n\n\nRisottos against social isolation\n\nThere are also a growing number of culturally appropriate options catering to the older Australians who want to continue living independently at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Adelaide, not-for-profit initiative Nonna's Cucina delivers home-cooked Italian food to 500 clients.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO Marco Staltari says the service started 26 years ago out of concern for older members of the Italian community who were struggling to cook for themselves, and the meal services on offer \"didn\u2019t really suit Italian tastebuds\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey emphasise flavours that Italian migrants grew up with. Traditional creamy risottos cater to those with northern Italian heritage. For Italian Australians with heritage from the south, they prepare pipi e patate, a dish of capsicum and potatoes. They also provide texture-modified foods to support people who are at higher risk of choking.\n\n\n\nAdelaide-based charity Nonna's Cucina delivers 500 home-style Italian meals daily and helps to reduce social isolation for older members of the community staying at home. Source: Supplied / Nonna's Cucina \"When people are older and lose a bit of their memory, these flavours always bring you back to your home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir menu rotates every five weeks, which general manager Dario Fabretto says provides their clients more choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you get older and you can\u2019t cook for yourself as much anymore, you might feel a bit hard done by or that it\u2019s unfair that you can\u2019t cook. And then you get told what you have to eat. So we try to provide as much variety as we can,\" Dario says.\n\n\n\nA feeling of home\n\nHugo says that being able to choose your meals, and feeling as if your preferences are being listened to, makes a significant impact in the quality of life for older Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's about residents feeling like their preferences are heard and understanding that they feel safe and can share their feedback. [This] links to a sense of maintaining your agency and having a voice and input into your community ... It's what it is to be human.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack at \u00c1rp\u00e1d Aged Care in Melbourne, Eva says she values the familiarity of home-cooked Hungarian meals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you're young, you don't think about these things, but when you're getting older and your time is over, you are just looking for a place where you belong.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The topic of e-scooters is a difficult one for Michael Seculovic.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, he marked what would have been his daughter Ava's 15th birthday.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe died last year after being hit by a car while riding her e-scooter across a busy road in Perth.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her dad's mind, Ava will always remain that 13-year-old girl on the precipice of taking on the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe had recently started at a new high school, which Seculovic was chuffed about, as it was the same school he had attended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was a bright, beautiful girl,\" he tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nMichael Seculovic's daughter Ava was 13 years old when she died from severe head injuries sustained in an accident on her e-scooter. Source: Supplied / Michael Seculovic \"She was very friendly; it didn't matter who it was, when anyone came up to her and said 'hello, how are you?' she always replied with 'good, thank you. How are you?'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was just beautiful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAva had received her scooter as a Christmas present just a few months before the accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeculovic says he had nagged her and her friends to wear helmets many times, as required by state law in Western Australia, but it was often a struggle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't from a lack of trying, I had went and purchased another helmet, as she had said that she didn't like the one she had,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But also, no one else was wearing a helmet, and like many girls, they are worried about their hair.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Call for scooter ban after Brisbane death\n\nTragically, Ava wasn't wearing one at the time of the accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeculovic has spent the past year reflecting on the regulations around e-scooters. He admits he wasn't fully aware of the legalities before his daughter's death.\n\n\n\nI was just going about everyday life, that was not really ever in front of me to know about.\n\nFor young people, e-rideables, such as e-scooters and e-bikes, represent an affordable and accessible means of transport \u2014 they are significantly cheaper than a car and can be used without a licence. Seculovic says he felt it offered his daughter some much-needed independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was her second year of high school, and she just wanted to have that sort of independence teenagers want,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as the devices have become more and more popular in Australia, so has debate over how to regulate them.\n\n\n\nAre e-bikes and e-scooters safe?\n\nParliamentary inquiries into e-rideables are taking place in WA and Queensland, following a rise in related accidents. Both will consider the benefits of the devices against issues regarding safety, regulation, enforcement and penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NSW government announced this week it is considering a temporary ban on the devices on public transport, pending community feedback, following two incidents in NSW and Victoria earlier this year, which involved e-rideable batteries catching fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy director of Monash University's Accident Research Centre (ARC), Professor Jennie Oxley, says incident rates have risen as the number of e-rideable users has grown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rates of injuries and deaths are increasing, and a big part of that is exposure [in traffic and public spaces], because these e-rideables are becoming popular, of course we're going to see increased numbers of injuries,\" she says.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Making a short trip? Why mopeds could be better for the environment than electric cars\n\nComparable state-based statistics on e-scooter-related injuries are not readily available.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the ARC collects data on emergency department presentations and hospital admissions related to e-mobility devices, which Oxley says mirrors the situation across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Victoria, between July 2017 and June 2023, there were 1,680 emergency department presentations related to e-scooter injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the same period, e-scooter injury rates increased from 0.3 to 14.9 per 100,000 people, says Oxley, adding that the rate would likely have increased with the growth of e-scooter use over the past two years.\n\n\n\nThe Victorian data did not specifically break down deaths related solely to e-scooters; instead, it listed 14 deaths as a result of all e-mobility devices between 2016 and 2020, with half of these related to e-bikes, while the rest related to other self-balancing devices, including e-scooters.\n\n\n\n\n\nWA Police confirmed it had recorded one death related to e-scooters in 2023 and three in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a submission to the inquiry into e-mobility safety in Queensland, the Australian Centre for Health Law Research said e-scooter incidents had resulted in at least eight deaths in Queensland in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Between January 2021 and December 2024, 4,902 people presented to 31 Queensland participating emergency departments with injuries from e-scooter incidents, resulting in eight deaths in 2024 alone,\" it reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These figures likely underestimate the true toll, as not all Queensland hospitals contribute data, and not all injured individuals seek treatment.\"\n\n\n\nAs more people use e-scooters, the incidents related to riding them have increased. Source: AAP / Luka Coch The submission noted that common injuries include fractures, dislocations and head trauma.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeculovic's daughter Ava suffered serious head injuries as a result of her accident in March 2024, which she later succumbed to.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile laws in WA ban those under 16 from riding e-scooters on roads in Australia, it is not uncommon to see children in their early teens out and about in the suburbs of Perth on e-scooters.\n\n\n\nGrowing popularity of e-rideables\n\nDespite the risks, experts say e-rideables are here to stay.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 report by cycling advocacy group WeRide Australia found that 3.6 million Australians had used an e-scooter in 2022 and that per capita usage was highest in WA and the ACT.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increasing affordability of e-scooters in recent years has also fuelled growth in the number of Australians using them.\n\n\n\nWhile it is illegal to travel on an e-scooter with more than one person, it has become common practice to do so in some parts of Australia. Source: Getty / Steve Waters While some high-end models may set you back around $5,000, a new e-scooter can cost as little as $500.\n\n\n\n\n\nOxley says while e-rideables are largely used by people commuting to and from work or study, gig-economy workers, such as food and mail delivery drivers, also rely heavily on them.\n\n\n\nAround one in five Australians used an e-scooter in 2022. Source: SBS News Estimates compiled by University of Sydney professor of transport management Stephen Greaves indicate that Australians own about 400,000 personal e-scooters and mobility devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is in addition to the thousands of e-mobility devices operating via share-ride schemes, which have been implemented in every capital city and across more than 25 local government areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreaves says they are a \"genuine alternative to motorised transport\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"E-mobility devices, including scooters, open up the possibility for many of those trips that are maybe 2-5 kilometres, where you think, 'why are people driving cars for such distances?'\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Electric Vehicle Association president Chris Jones says the boom in electric personal mobility is transformative and should be supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are some of the most accessible and affordable electric vehicles in the world, and they take up a fraction of the space of a car,\" he says.\n\n\n\nWe should be encouraging their uptake with sensible regulation.\n\nA submission to the Queensland inquiry from Brisbane West Bicycle User Group said that Queensland and the Brisbane City Council local government area are \"failing to capitalise on the congestion-busting benefits of micromobility, and particularly the increased accessibility\" afforded by e-mobility options.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt pointed out that in Brisbane, 56 per cent of all trips across all modes of transport between 2021 and 2024 were less than 5km in distance and that 75 per cent of trips under 5km were taken by car.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group asked the inquiry to consider the benefits of e-mobility devices and their potential to replace the \"second or third family car\", which would \"have significant environmental benefits, both in terms of day-to-day emissions and pollution, but also reduced demand for road space and parking...\"\n\n\n\nInconsistent regulation\n\nFor the benefits of e-rideables to be fully realised, experts say better regulation needs to be enforced.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws vary state by state and are overdue for an update, says Greaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen e-scooters first entered the Australian market around 20 years ago, they fell into grey regulatory territory, he explains, as their integration into transport systems and roads had not been planned for.\n\n\n\n\"The origins of these rules came originally from AustRoads [a national agency representing state transport departments] ... They were talking about kids' scooters and skateboards and all those sorts of things,\" Greaves says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They classified them as recreational devices: the terminology was a 'wheeled recreational device' and it was then up to each state to figure out how they were going to manage that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreaves says the variation between states has implications for whether devices can be used on roads or footpaths, age limits and registration requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, in NSW, we're not sure where scooters belong \u2014 some people consider them a kid's toy, others think of them as more of a moped. But, of course, they are not roadworthy as a motorcycle, so are illegal.\"\n\n\n\nIt's all a mess.\n\nWhile the NSW and Northern Territory governments have implemented laws that prohibit using personal e-scooters on public roads and footpaths, most other states permit their use under certain circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nA driver's licence is not needed to ride an e-scooter in jurisdictions where they are permitted in public areas, but riders often need to be above a certain age.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn WA and Victoria, riders must be at least 16 years of age to use an e-scooter in public spaces.\n\n\n\nQueensland allows those aged 12-15 to ride them as long as they are accompanied by an adult, while the ACT does not stipulate a minimum age; however, those under 12 must be accompanied by an adult.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelmets are generally required by law for public use, and certain activities, such as riding with more than one person or with a mobile phone in one hand, are not allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also variations in enforceable speed limits. Riders in WA can travel on footpaths as long as they do not exceed 10km/h, while in Tasmania, it is 15km/h. It is illegal to ride an e-scooter on a footpath in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some states, the maximum speed for e-scooters in public areas is 20km/h; elsewhere, it is capped at 25km/h.\n\n\n\nRiding context and speed\n\nGreaves argues that regulation needs to be \"context dependent\" and take into account riding locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the inner city of Sydney, we have a decent bike network, and we have relatively low usage of those bike lanes. They should be allowed and that's what people expressed when we surveyed on this,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think they're alright on local roads, where we are moving to the 40km/h default speed limits. I don't think they should be on main roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Outside of the CBD, I think they should be allowed on footpaths. You go out into the suburbs and you might see two people walking on a footpath, [so] you've got this perfect infrastructure for e-scooters; let's use it for e-scooters and make it a shared path.\"\n\n\n\nTransport management professor Stephen Greaves says the local context needs to be considered when it comes to e-scooter regulations. Source: Supplied He says local governments should be engaged to help determine safe and appropriate contexts for e-rideables \u2014 but also speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, the state tries to set blanket rules around everything, but at the end of the day, the local jurisdiction needs to tweak those rules depending on the situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March, Queensland Police warned consumers to be aware that some e-scooters being sold in Queensland exceeded the legal speed limits, which put them in a different category to personal mobility devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreaves says while imposing limitations on the speed of e-scooters might help to ensure those sold on the market comply with legal limits, he is aware that some e-scooter owners in Australia are making alterations to increase the speed of their devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very easy to override that,\" he says.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO New rules could soon ban charging of e-bikes in NSW apartments SBS News 00:50 English\n\nHe adds that implementing very low speed limits for e-scooters could take away their \"intrinsic appeal\" in helping people get from A to B faster than it would take to walk. It may also affect device operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you get below about 10 km/h it's actually quite hard to control it, it gets wobbly. There is a sort of sweet spot which is about 15km /h.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Jennie Oxley from Monash points out that is the increased speed of e-scooters over walking as well as the slower interactions with traffic that add to the risk of injury.\n\n\n\nCompliance of e-mobility devices\n\nOne of the recommendations to come from a 2024 report from Monash University's ARC on injuries associated with e-scooters, e-bikes and other e-mobility devices was to \"increase police enforcement\" in an effort to deter \"noncompliant riding behaviours\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News contacted police departments in each Australian state and territory to obtain recent data on e-ridable-related infringements; however, only WA and the ACT provided them.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw numbers in the nation's capital reflect similar patterns to those in WA.\n\n\n\n\n\nWA officers recorded 303 infringements in regard to e-mobility devices between January 2024 and 7 October 2024 (when responsibility of collection of data moved to the Department of Transport) and a total of 510 infringements in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 85 per cent of those were related to helmets, and about 5 per cent were in relation to speeding.\n\n\n\nLaws around the use of e-scooters and other e-rideables differ from state to state. Source: Getty / BJP7images A WA Police spokesperson told SBS News: \"As with any vehicle, speed, drug and alcohol use and a lack of helmet use are contributing factors to the causes of serious injury or death involving ERDs [e-rideable devices].\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While infringements are an appropriate deterrent, they are only issued when the irresponsible or reckless rider is caught at that moment in time. The most effective way to deter irresponsible, dangerous and reckless operation of ERDs is to seize and destroy the vehicles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March, Queensland Police made a public appeal for people to take personal mobility device laws seriously, noting that between November 2022 and December 2024, more than 2,700 infringements were issued to riders for illegal road use.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile e-bikes and e-motorbikes are categorised differently from e-scooters, there have been calls to mandate their registration and to legalise their use on roads.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Faulty e-bike battery sparks Sydney apartment evacuation\n\nGreaves says research has shown community support for some sort of registration, insurance and licensing of e-mobility devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a number of considerations to take into account, but such measures could potentially encourage more responsible ownership and riding,\" he says.\n\n\n\n'It really sucks'\n\nSeculovic remembers refusing to wear a helmet when riding his bike as a child, but strongly encourages anyone using an e-scooter to wear one.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says parents with teens in particular face a challenge around e-scooter use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you don't let them have one, do you then run the risk that they will then jump on the back of someone else's anyway?\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite his personal grief over his daughter's death, Seculovic says banning scooters outright is not realistic.\n\n\n\nLook at all the road accidents, you can't just ban cars, can you?\n\nWhen a workmate recently expressed feeling conflicted about whether to allow their son to get an e-scooter, his only advice was: \"Go take him down to Wanneroo Road [northern Perth], and see Ava's cross.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's the end result, which could happen.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of the high stakes meeting with Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump said he would know within two minutes of meeting the Russian leader whether it would be a success.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took almost three hours before the leaders emerged from the meeting behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the first face-to-face meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Putin since 2019, with the Russian leader ostracised by Western leaders since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter their meeting, Mr Trump and Mr Putin emerged to speak before reporters in Anchorage, but they took no questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe that we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many points that we agreed on - most of them. I would say. A couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there. But we have made some head way. There is no deal until there is a deal. I will call up NATO in a little while. I will of course call up President Zelenskyy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump later told Fox News that he rated the meeting a 10 out of 10 - even though he revealed no details of the points of agreement and disagreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is not that much. There is one or two significant items (of disagreement). But I think they can be reached. Not it is really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done. And I would also say the European nations. They have to get involved a little bit. But it is up to President Zelenskyy. And if they like, I will be at the next meeting. They are going to set up a meeting between President Zelenskyy, President Putin and myself, I guess. Not that I want to be there, but I want to make sure that it gets done. We have a pretty good chance of getting it done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a change in the tone Mr Trump had a few weeks ago when he issued a August 8 deadline for Mr Putin to show a genuine commitment to a ceasefire - or face stronger sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the post-meeting press conference, Mr Putin was keen to cast the meeting as a success for him - in receiving the invitation, but also on the prospect of a Russian-US economic reset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I expect that today's agreement will be the starting point - not only for the solution of the Ukrainian issue. But will also help us bring back business and pragmatic relations between Russia and the US.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he has not shifted in his position on the full-scale invasion in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're convinced that in order to make the settlement lasting long-term, we need to eliminate the primary roots, the primary causes of the conflict. And we have said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia and to reinstate a just balance of security in Europe - and in the world on a whole.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at the end of the press conference, Mr Putin was eager to secure another meeting with the US President.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: \"Thank you very much Vladimir.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVladimir Putin: \"Next time in Moscow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: \"Oh, that's an interesting one! I will get a little heat on that one but I could see it possibly happening. Thank you very much Vladimir. Thank you all! Thank you!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVladimir Putin: Thank you so much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Sussex is a fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there was a lot of theatre and optics involved in the high stakes visit - and Mr Putin got what he wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yes, it's certainly a win for Vladimir Putin. The optics of it were that, you know, he came to American territory, but American territory in Alaska, which of course previously was part of the Russian Federation and there was a lot of media talk in Russia and billboards going up saying, you know, Alaska is Russian and we will take that back. So he got a photo opportunity with Donald Trump. So it makes him look, look respected and valued and making the American president travel all the way to Anchorage to meet him. And at the same time, he basically dodges those sanctions that Trump had threatened.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Cancian is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says despite the convivial language between Mr Trump and Mr Putin, the Alaska summit was planned haphazardly from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The press conference was startling - even bizarre - in the sense that the meeting was expected to last maybe six hours and broke up after about three. Then the press conference was called very abruptly. The journalists race into the room. The parties come on stage and speak their piece. Putin starts off and Trump responds, and then they trip off after a couple of minutes, they take no questions and Putin gets on his airplane, flies away. And I don't think anyone quite expected a result like that. On the other hand, the words spoken were very friendly. Both Putin and Trump were encouraging about the future, but vague. And this is clearly the first step on, you know, what could be a long journey.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says negotiations to end wars can take a long time to finalise, but there is a positive for Ukraine in that the worst outcome was avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Another encouraging thing was Trump saying that the Europeans and Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, had to be part of this agreement, and that had not come through quite clearly again about a week ago. The concern is that the pressure will go on to Zelenskyy to give up territory, to make an end to the conflict and get it over with as Trump would say. The Ukrainians are very reluctant to give up territory.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUkrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he has been briefed on the Alaska meeting in a phone call with Mr Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe call also ended with an invitation for him to come to Washington DC on Monday (18 August local time).\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "One of the world\u2019s most dangerous water-borne microorganisms, commonly called a \"brain-eating amoeba\", has recently been detected in two drinking water supplies in south-west Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth affected towns are about 750 kilometres west of Brisbane: Augathella (population roughly 300) and Charleville (population 3,000).\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring an analysis of water samples commissioned by Queensland Health, Naegleria fowleri was detected in the water systems of two health facilities, one in Charleville and one in Augathella, as well as in the incoming town water supply at both facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shire Council of Murweh, which takes in the two affected locations, issued a health notice for residents and visitors on August 7 warning of the detection of N. fowleri in the water supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what is this organism? And how significant is the risk likely to be in these Queensland towns, and elsewhere?\n\n\n\nWhat is the brain-eating amoeba?\n\nThe N. fowleri amoeba is a microscopic organism found around the world. It only lives in warm freshwater, generally between 25 and 40\u00b0C. This can include ponds, lakes, rivers, streams and hot springs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf someone is infected with N. fowleri , it causes what\u2019s called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a serious infection of the brain.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Alana felt good about donating her eggs until she realised her sexuality was an issue\n\nSymptoms include a sore throat, headache, hallucinations, confusion, vomiting, fever, neck stiffness, changes to taste and smell, and seizures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incubation period of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis \u2014 the time between infection and symptoms appearing \u2014 typically ranges from three to seven days.\n\n\n\n\n\nTragically, this illness is nearly always fatal, even if someone receives medical attention quickly. Death typically occurs about five days after symptoms begin.\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately though, cases are very rare. In the United States, there were 167 reported cases of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis between 1962 and 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only four survived.\n\n\n\n\n\nA global review of the disease up to 2018 reported that, of 381 known cases, Australia accounted for 22, the fifth highest number, after the US, Pakistan, Mexico and India. Some 92 per cent of people died.\n\n\n\nHow do people get infected?\n\nThe route of infection is very unusual and quite specific. N. fowleri infects the brain through a person\u2019s nose. The amoeba then passes through a protective membrane called the nasal epithelium.\n\n\n\nThis is an important physical barrier and allows the amoeba to travel to the brain through the olfactory nerve, which is responsible for our sense of smell. The infection then kills brain tissue and causes swelling of the brain, termed cerebral oedema.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfections occur in people when infected water travels up their nose. Most cases involve children and young people who have swum in infected waters. The majority of cases occur in males, with an average age of 14.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven water sports in affected waterways can be dangerous. A person is currently in intensive care in Missouri after it\u2019s believed they became infected while water skiing.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the recent detection in Queensland water supply systems, the source of the infection has not been reported. It\u2019s possible a fresh waterway, or groundwater, which feeds into the affected drinking water systems, was contaminated with N. fowleri , and the amoeba travelled from there. But this will likely be determined with further investigation.\n\n\n\nIs it dangerous in drinking water?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to note you can\u2019t get primary amoebic meningoencephalitis from drinking contaminated water.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut any activity that allows infected water to enter a person\u2019s nose is potentially dangerous. This can happen during a bath or a shower.\n\n\n\nSome people flush their nasal passages to clear congestion related to allergies or a viral infection. This has been linked to infections with N. fowleri . If you\u2019re going to flush your nasal passages, you should use a sterile saline solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven young children playing with hoses, sprinklers or water activities could be at risk. A 16-month-old child was fatally infected following an incident involving a contaminated water \"splash pad\" in the US in 2023. Splash pads are water-based recreation activities, primarily for young children, that involve splashing or spraying water.\n\n\n\nWhat is the risk in Queensland?\n\nRegarding N. fowleri , Australian drinking water guidelines advise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the organism is detected, advice should be sought from the relevant health authority or drinking water regulator.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guidelines also provide recommendations on how to disinfect water supplies and control N. fowleri , using chlorine and other chemical compounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll public town water supplies across Australia are regularly tested to ensure that water is safe to drink.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Albanese government moves ahead with election pledge to cap prescription medicines to $25\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know the exact cause of the detection of the amoeba N. fowleri in these Queensland towns\u2019 water supplies. But drinking or cooking with water contaminated with this amoeba will not cause an infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny activity that allows potentially contaminated water to go up the nose should be navigated carefully for now in the affected areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nContamination of a town drinking water supply from this amoeba is very rare and is unlikely in other Australian town water supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reduce your risk in potentially infected warm, fresh waters you should keep your head above water while swimming. And don\u2019t jump or dive in. You can use a nose-clip if you want to swim with your head under water.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amoeba cannot survive in salt water, so there\u2019s no risk swimming in the ocean. Also, properly maintained swimming pools should be safe from the organism.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Health advises that the amoeba cannot survive in water that is clean, cool and adequately chlorinated.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Talks to strike a landmark global treaty on plastic pollution fell apart on Friday, leaving many frustrated and some calling it a \"missed opportunity\".\n\n\n\n\n\nNegotiators from 185 nations met in Geneva last week to try and draft the world's first legally-binding treaty to deal with the growing global issue of plastic pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite working beyond Thursday's deadline and through the night, the talks were ultimately futile and nations could not reach a consensus.\n\n\n\n\n\nA large bloc of nations including the European Union, Britain and many African and Latin American countries called for curbing plastic production and phasing out toxic chemicals used in plastics.\n\n\n\nHowever, a smaller group of oil-producing states including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia argued instead for waste management.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese countries railed against the negotiations being based on the entire life-cycle of plastic: from the petroleum-derived substance through to waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile around 100 nations sought caps on plastic production, a number of countries including the United States stood against them and argued caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.\n\n\n\nWhile a large number of nations argued for caps on plastic production others, including the US, stood against them. Source: AAP / Martial Trezzini/EPA\n\n'Missed a historic opportunity'\n\nRepresentatives of countries voiced anger and despair as the talks unravelled, but said they wanted future negotiations \u2014 despite six rounds of talks over three years now having failed to find agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have missed a historic opportunity but we have to keep going and act urgently,\" said Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n\nColombia added: \"The negotiations were consistently blocked by a small number of states who simply don't want an agreement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTuvalu, speaking for 14 Pacific small island developing states, said: \"For our islands this means that without global cooperation and state action, millions of tonnes of plastic waste will continue to be dumped in our oceans, affecting our ecosystem, food security, livelihood and culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance's ecological transition minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said she was \"disappointed\" and \"angry\" and blamed a handful of countries \"guided by short-term financial interests\" for blocking an ambitious treaty.\n\n\n\n\"Oil-producing countries and their allies have chosen to look the other way,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham Forbes, the head of Greenpeace's delegation to the talks called the collapse of negotiations a \"wake up call for the world\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The vast majority of governments want a strong agreement, yet a handful of bad actors were allowed to use process to drive such ambition into the ground. We cannot continue to do the same thing and expect a different result. The time for hesitation is over,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental NGOs also warned that without radically changing the process to better reflect the majority view, future talks will hit the same dead end.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Azoulay from the Center for International Environmental Law's David Azoulay said the talks had been an \"abject failure\" because some countries were out to \"block any attempt at advancing a viable treaty\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature said the talks exposed how consensus decision-making \"had now \"outplayed its role in international environmental negotiations\".\n\n\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nOil-producing nations argued that recycling, reuse and product design were sufficient to address the problem of global plastic pollution without resorting to production cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, experts say these are not substantial answers to the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nIngar Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), which hosted the talks, has said the world \"will not recycle our way out of the plastic pollution crisis\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile 15 per cent of plastic waste is collected for recycling, only nine per cent is actually recycled.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The tiny particles infiltrating our bodies and causing big problems for Australia\n\nThe future of the UNEP negotiations is now uncertain and while some countries have committed to resuming negotiations, others expressed that they have lost faith after repeated attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndersen also pledged to continue work. \"We did not get where we want but people want a deal,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn current trends, annual production of fossil-fuel-based plastics will nearly triple by 2060 to 1.2 billion tonnes, while waste will exceed one billion tonnes, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\n\n\n",

We do not have a national scheme, and the states and territories administer those schemes. We are looking at a way in which we can get the most efficient outcome, and that is by individual state schemes talking to one another. That\u2019s what we are going to do through the National Checking Capability, and that\u2019s what states and territories have agreed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Childcare Alliance says the move would help close dangerous loopholes but urged further measures, including a national register for early childhood educators and teachers.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump says he and Russian President Vladimir Putin were not able to reach an agreement at talks in Alaska, but he believes progress has been made toward achieving a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summit has been the first face-to-face encounter for the two leaders since 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile President Trump seemed confident of achieving a deal with Russia prior to the meeting, he now says there are still some key points that need to be addressed first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's no deal until there's a deal. I will call up NATO in a little while, I will call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today's meeting. It's ultimately up to them. But we had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to and there are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn't get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Putin praised Mr Trump for helping make diplomatic progress toward peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our talks were held in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere, and were very thorough and useful. I would like to thank my American colleague once again for the offer to come to Alaska. It is quite logical to meet here. After all, our countries, although separated by oceans, are in fact close neighbours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Putin has also suggested the next round of talks could take place in Moscow.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government has welcomed the diplomatic steps taken by United States President Donald Trump at talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland tells Channel Seven that all tools must be used to push for an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine has been going on for too long and we as a government welcome the United States involvement to try to bring this conflict to a close. Australia stands with Ukraine and any methods and any useful tools that the US could have at its disposal through this meeting is one that we certainly welcome because I'm sure that all Australians want to see this conflict end, as does the rest of the free world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nAn earthquake has struck Queensland with thousands feeling the effects near Australia's east coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoscience Australia registered a 5.6 magnitude earthquake near the Wrattens National Park at Kilkivan, about 170 kilometres northwest of Brisbane this morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quake was recorded about 9:50am at a depth of two kilometres.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 6000 people told the agency that they felt the affects of the quake within half an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency says earthquakes above magnitude five occur every one-to-two years, with an average of 100 quakes at magnitude three or lower recorded each year in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf a century ago then prime minister Gough Whitlam poured a handful of soil into the hands of a man who had led an eight-year protest for the rights of his people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 16th of August 1975 Mr Whitlam travelled to Wave Hill Station, about 600 kilometres south of Darwin, to hand back land to the Gurindji people.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the first time the Commonwealth Government had returned land to its original custodians.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the handover ceremony, transferring leasehold title to a parcel of land at the Wave Hill cattle station to Gurindji people, Mr Whitlam poured the soil into the hands of senior Elder Vincent Lingiari.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says the iconic image of the exchange is an enduring tribute to the courage, determination and solidarity of Gurindji people.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, Liverpool have beaten Bournemouth in a 4-2 thriller at Anfield in the opening match of the Premier League season.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewcomer Hugo Ekiteke bagged a goal on his debut before Cody Gakpo doubled the lead at the beginning of the second half.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Antoine Semenyo, who was the target of racist abuse from fans in the first half, scored twice in 12 minutes to shock the home fans and level the playing field.\n\n\n\n",

We never give up. And when we win, it won't be by luck. Amen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEight-year-old Axton Hale is getting into the zone behind the chutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's praying in a circle with other riders before taking on a bucking bull in the red dirt arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Let's go now. Are you ready?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's an organised chaos, with cowboys and cowgirls getting ready before they compete. The chaps are on and pep talks can be heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just a fun sport, you get on cool bulls and ride cool bulls. I have some emotions if I fall off I might get a tiny little emotional but I have God with me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAxton is among dozens of young international competitors at the Mount Isa rodeo, which has been around since 1959.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's the first time the event has hosted a junior tri-national competition, with riders from the US, New Zealand and Australia going head-to-head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hi my name is Jacki Gayle and I'm a bull rider on team USA.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 16-year-old is the only female junior bull rider at this year's rodeo - hailing all the way from Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe African American teenager started riding when she was just 11 years old, but it took months to convince her mother that the sport was safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She called me crazy at first and thought that I was going to get hurt; and I wouldn't like it. But I tried and it and here we are four years later. And I've got all my friends and my rodeo family telling me that I can do this. And I don't know, it's just fun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJacki has earned recognition in various rodeo sanctions and currently holds the title of Southern New Mexico Rodeo Princess.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recently competed in the Bill Pickett Youth Rodeo - an event in Texas which aims to honour Black rodeo history.\n\n\n\n\n\nJacki admits that growing up, she didn't see many cowboys and cowgirls that look like her - with representation now being an important part of her rodeo journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There isn't very many dark skinned or African American cowboys out there. So it's nice for me to be one of the few who are trying to get more awareness and get more people into the sport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd she's not the only one bringing a unique flare to the arena.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other nation competing against Australia and the USA - is New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sounds of Hakka dance and chant)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the first day of the rodeo and the sun is about to rise; standing in the empty arena, performing the Haka is the New Zealand team.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading the Haka is Ty Blake, the 16-year-old bull rider attended his first rodeo when he was just 6 weeks old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rodeo culture is just family, just one big family. Everyone's together, everyone helps each other out. Dad used to show jump way back in his glory days; and Mum's a horsemanship world champion. So I have good genes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the sport has taught him resilience - and fearlessness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a song, called hooked on an 8 second ride and it's about the adrenaline that goes through. And it's something you can't get over. It's like an itch you just got to scratch it and ever since then, I've been scratching it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKylee Ferguson is the director for the youth rodeo organisation; and he helped co-ordinate the international talent for 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we take teams to other countries, we really focus on that team building experience and making friends. To us the most important thing is getting the contacts on the other side of the world. You can see the friendships already formed and spending a lot of time together. I think, it's the best way to make friendships across the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sound of cows mooing)\n\n\n\n\n\nA growing sport - making way for a new generation of rodeo athletes...\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding up and coming First Nations bull riders: like 10-year-old Carl Douglas Jnr, who made the journey to Mount Isa from Cape York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels good, sitting on it and riding on it make your family proud. My family was doing bull riding - my cousin, brothers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese young riders, hoping to win some buckles - and lend a hand along the way. Axton again.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "MUSIC\n\nTak\u00e1cs Quartet with Angie Milliken \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMusica Viva, Melbourne Recital Centre, August 14 In a very welcome return to Melbourne, the Tak\u00e1cs Quartet reaffirmed itself as probably the best string quartet on the planet. Tak\u00e1cs Quartet perform at Melbourne Recital Centre, August 14. 2025. Credit: Cameron Jamieson Haydn\u2019s Quartet in G minor, Op. 74, No. 3 was a splendid curtain-raiser, showcasing the group\u2019s burnished, multifaceted tone. Like looking into a gemstone, there were flashes of brilliance but beguiling depths of colour. After revelling in the quick-witted interplay of parts in the first movement, there came a superbly controlled second-movement choral. So ebullient was the finale that the audience burst into applause before the end. Brisbane-born, Berlin-based composer Cathy Milliken\u2019s Sonnet of an Emigrant after Bertolt Brecht for narrator and string quartet was commissioned for Musica Viva\u2019s 80th anniversary season. In marrying Brecht\u2019s poetry of displacement with fragmented reminiscences of the Viennese modernism with which many musical refugees would have been familiar, Millikin has created an evocative meditation on loss and new beginnings. The empathetic narration by the composer\u2019s sister Angie Milliken alternated between English and German, underlining a loss of belonging.\n\nAt the heart of the program was Beethoven\u2019s String Quartet in C major, Op. 59, No. 3. The vastly different timbres of the first two chords signalled that this would be an engrossing account. Indeed, it riveted listeners for some 30 minutes. Loading After the initial brilliance of C major, it was hard not to swoon to the ensuing Andante, beautifully underpinned by Andr\u00e1s Fej\u00e9r\u2019s cello. A vividly contrasted Menuetto led directly into the fugato finale, taken at breakneck speed and overflowing with energy and excitement. A generous encore, the second movement of Ravel\u2019s String Quartet, captivated not only with its exquisite elegance but with the most luscious pizzicato anyone could hope to hear this side of the pearly gates. Such heavenly music making really does put the Tak\u00e1cs Quartet in a class of its own.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nElevator Music \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nOmega Ensemble, Melbourne Recital Centre, August 16 Despite the tenuous link between elevators and this Omega Ensemble program, most of the music seemed to be chosen to lift listeners\u2019 spirits. Loading Elevator Music is the title of a jazz-infused work by Adelaide-based composer Graeme Koehne, which (confusingly) was not performed. Keohne, however, provided a new work for orchestra and two clarinets to showcase the talents of English virtuoso Michael Collins and Omega\u2019s artistic director David Rowden. Dances on the Edge of Time (a title derived from poetry by Rabindranath Tagore) consists of three movements (a rigaudon, a chaconne and a gigue), each tagged with a phrase from the popular aphorism attributed to baseballer Leroy \u201cSatchel\u201d Paige: \u201cWork like you don\u2019t need the money, love like you\u2019ve never been hurt and dance like nobody\u2019s watching.\u201d\n\nCollins and Rowden, along with the rest of the ensemble, willingly followed Paige\u2019s advice. Surmounting a buoyant rhythmic accompaniment, the ascending solo lines of the Rigaudon radiated a carefree approach. Classic gestures in the chaconne spoke of loss then love, while the concluding gigue hinted at the rustic style of Australian musical larrikin Percy Grainger. Koehne\u2019s concerto was preceded by the instantly recognisable Allegro from Mozart\u2019s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, whose jollity stood in stark contrast to Stride by American composer Anna Clyne. Drawing material from Beethoven\u2019s Pathetique Sonata, Clyne\u2019s often busy and astringent soundscape created episodes of tension and release. Originally written for swing jazz legend Benny Goodman, Aaron Copland\u2019s Clarinet Concerto, with its masterly writing for both orchestra and soloist, was brilliantly executed by Collins. Effortlessly negotiating its melodious languor and its infectious rhythmic energy, Collins happily and vividly brought the music alive in time and space. Arranged for two clarinets, the final movement from Elena Kats-Chernin\u2019s Ornamental Air proved the perfect encore, taking the mood, as it were, to the top floor.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nPress Club \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nCorner Hotel, August 8 \u201cYou should see the piece of skin hanging off my shin,\u201d says Press Club singer Natalie Foster of the blood trickling down her leg, just four songs in. \u201cIt scared me. I\u2019ve only seen that once before when I was 18 and fell off a construction site drinking tequila.\u201d Press Club perform at the Corner Hotel on Friday, August 8. Credit: Martin Philbey This banter could be a manifesto for her jangly, garage-punk quartet. Misadventures and big emotions, testing limits and returning home to report on them: they\u2019re key themes throughout the Brunswick group\u2019s catalogue. Since their debut in 2017, the staunchly DIY Press Club have been on a tear \u2013 stomping across world stages and releasing four LPs in quick succession. Tonight they\u2019re launching their latest, the sugary punk sheen of To All the Ones I Love. It also makes for an emotional homecoming, laced with a slight hint of exhaustion, to close the band\u2019s 10-week, 30-date European and Australian tour.\n\nFollowing a walk-on to the moody I Am Everything, Press Club throw everything at it. \u201cWe\u2019re from Melbourne,\u201d says Foster before a blistering Cancelled. \u201cFeels f---ing good to be playing our hometown.\u201d The gig served as both an album launch and an emotional homecoming for the band. Credit: Martin Philbey The celebratory Headwreck ignites the first singalong, and from there it\u2019s over to Foster to pull focus \u2013 be it via bloody injuries or her incredible voice, which retains its husky, impeccably roaring croon even when she\u2019s mid-headbang, pulling a handstand mid-verse of Coward Street, or lost deep in the crowd. Around her the band sizzles on Greg Rietwyk\u2019s relentlessly melodic guitar lines, Iain MacRae\u2019s excellent burbling bass and the breakneck drumming of Timmy Hansen, filling in for founding member Frank Lees, who\u2019s on parental leave. Dynamics of a punk show can be tricky \u2013 if every song allegedly inspires catharsis, after a while the stakes don\u2019t seem as high. Press Club mitigate this with clever stylistic detours. Mid-show highlight Untitled Wildlife features Stu Patterson from support band Placement lend wailing saxophone to an indie-rock build that culminates in real anthemic alchemy. Suburbia, from the band\u2019s debut, Late Teens, remains the perfect set closer, Foster yelling, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to letting all your dreams go\u201d, while instructing the crowd to launch themselves one last time.\n\nBack for an encore, Foster takes the dying minute of joyous, Smiths-y closer Wilt to jump into the crowd and make her way over to help out at the merchandise desk. As we file out, she\u2019s there keeping the dream alive.\n\nReviewed by Marcus Teague DANCE\n\nPhantasm \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nChunky Move Studios, until August 16 The title of Melanie Lane\u2019s new show suggests a singular, self-contained vision. In the event, however, it unfolds as a plurality of figments and counterfeits drawn from the archives of popular culture with only the loosest thematic connection. The setting is impressive. Working with designers Eugyeene Teh and Bosco Shaw, Lane constructs a wonderfully gothic space enclosed by solid walls of darkness, filled with haze and crossed with scrims. Phantasm takes place in a wonderfully gothic space. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti\n\nA lone dancer drops into this lowermost dungeon of the mind. She bites the head off a rat, blood running over her chin, then jerks and twitches, hands vibrating like a plucked string. It\u2019s a strong opening, with the promise of something visceral, bloody and unexpected: a feminine nexus of death, desire and horror, darkly animate. Yet little of this intensity carries through the rest of the work. Phantasm, the title of Melanie Lane\u2019s new show, suggests a singular, self-contained vision. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti We move through predictable variations: exotic dancers, demonic cheerleaders, gothic heroines, romantic ballerinas, witches on broomsticks. Some, like the witches suspended above the stage, are more interesting than others. They are all, however, fairly generic images. They\u2019re types or figures, mythic only in the rather desolate sense that they are overexposed: tropes of femininity endlessly adapted and exploited by mass culture.\n\nWe rely on the movement to give these figures new relevance, and to provide the thread that might bind them into a collective phantasm. This doesn\u2019t happen. Instead, the dance often settles into familiarity. Costumes are exiguous and change often: witches\u2019 rags give way to tinselled cheer skirts, then tutus. Only mushroom-coloured bodystockings remain constant, giving, at a squint, the illusion of nudity. Loading In the final scene, the bodystocking is also stripped away. The setting shifts to a primeval forest where the women exchange gestures of care. The implication seems to be that this is the real myth behind the others: a return to some essentialised, pastoral femininity. I\u2019m not convinced. This image of the natural woman seems just as constructed and just as overexposed as the others. Does Lane really intend this as a return to the body in its purest form? Surely this is just another costume to be sloughed?",

Melbourne, semi-finalists the previous year, missed the top eight in her absence.\n\nTyla Hanks was just as busy on Saturday with 29 disposals, and kicked two goals to match Kate Hore and Eden Zanker.\n\nThe Western Bulldogs had their own returning star, with former skipper Ellie Blackburn collecting 17 touches through managed minutes.\n\nBlackburn was limited to three games last season before hurting her foot.\n\nJasmyn Smith was the Bulldogs\u2019 main ball winner with 21 disposals.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "One savvy charity shop flipper made $500 in 30 minutes thanks to an incredibly niche discovery. Source: TikTok/Flip Weekly/Savers\n\nSifting through charity shops to uncover hidden gems is a popular Australian pastime. And while many shoppers have recently decried the rising cost of items sold at op shops across the country, those who have the patience to meticulously dig up treasure have even managed to turn the practice into a lucrative business endeavour.\n\nOne such person is professional thrifter Mat, who recently revealed the incredible \"niche\" find that made him $500 in just 30 minutes after listing the item for sale online.\n\nMat Carpenter, who runs Flip Weekly, a newsletter and podcast teaching Aussies how to flip undervalued products found in op shops, told Yahoo News that he was wandering around a Savers thrift store when he came across a unique-looking mug priced at $7.49.\n\nMat had heard that pottery mugs made by Australia's oldest rum distillery, Beenleigh Rum, in the 1950s are now highly sought after and went \"on the lookout for anything that combines alcohol and pottery.\"\n\nWhat's the story behind the $500 mug?\n\nThe brown ceramic jug depicts the caricatured face of \"Bosun Bill\". According to Beenliegh Artisan Distillers, the character comes from the legend of 'The Bosun', who operated a floating sugar mill along the Albert and Logan Rivers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"He soon found a productive use for the excess molasses he produced- making Rum on the sly,\" the distillery's website states.\n\nWhen the floating sugar mill, the SS Walrus, washed ashore in 1984 onto the land of the distillery, all that was found was the Bosun\u2019s Copper Pot, inspiring its creation.\n\nThe mugs were created as memorabilia for the rum brand, and now the collectible items sell for top dollar online.\n\n\"I couldn't tell you the detailed history of Bosun Bill or Beenleigh Rum, all I know is that collectors pay a ridiculous amount of money for their items,\" said Mat. \"Fancy paying $500 for a rum jug that doesn't contain any rum,\" he joked.\n\nFlipper's advice for making lucrative discoveries in op shops\n\nWhile Mat admits that the find is incredibly niche, he advised that Aussies looking to make cash by flipping items from charity shops can easily replicate his efforts. First, they \"need to know what they're looking for,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Sydneysider previously shared with Yahoo Finance that he is earning $4,000 a month by turning one man\u2019s trash into another\u2019s treasure. He has since now flipped hundreds of items, including books, toys, DVDs and CDs, and collectable clothes, and shares advice in his weekly newsletter.\n\n\"My background is finding unusual ways to make money,\" he said. \"There's nothing more unusual than picking up a mug in a thrift store for $7.50 and selling it 30 minutes later for $500.\"\n\nMat is able to identify exactly what is valuable, but also what's not. Last month, he called out Vinnies for selling relatively common books for as much as $1,000, advertising them behind the counter as rare and hard to find.\n\nThe books \u2014 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince \u2014 were listed for $500 and $1,000, respectively. The books were labelled as rare first editions, but Mat argued they actually \"far from it\".\n\nAfter Yahoo News approached St Vincent de Paul Society (Vinnies), the charity shop confirmed the two items were pulled from the shelves, admitting that the advertised pricing was made in error.\n\nA $1,000 item sold at a Sydney Vinnies store has sparked an investigation.

It turned out that a small detail on the dial \u2014 the words \"Australian Bureau of Statistics\" \u2014 made it an incredibly valuable find. The government agency previously recognised long-standing staff by gifting them a watch.\n\nAfter receiving \"a lot of offers to buy it\" he decided to list it on eBay, where on Tuesday he sold it for over $500.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers has taken a thinly veiled shot at US President Donald Trump. Picture: Mandel Ngan / AFP / Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\nJim Chalmers has blasted tariffs as a \u201ctax on the workers and families of the country that levies them\u201d while flagging further action on \u201cnuisance tariffs\u201d.\n\nNuisance tariffs are import taxes that, while generating some government revenue, are considered inefficient and burdensome.\n\nThe Treasurer last year removed some 500 duties on a range of everyday items, including toothbrushes, women\u2019s health products and fridges.\n\nFresh Treasury data showed dropping the imposts would save businesses $180m in compliance costs by the end of 2029-30 and already streamlined $8.5bn-worth of annual trade.\n\nIn a thinly veiled shot at Donald Trump, Mr Chalmers said on Sunday \u201cthere are good reasons to swim against the tide a bit when it comes to tariffs\u201d.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers is mulling further action on \u2018nuisance tariffs\u2019. Picture: Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\n\u201cSome of these nuisance tariffs in our economy risk doing more harm than good, and tariffs are essentially a tax on the workers and families of the country that levies them,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve made a heap of progress abolishing 500 nuisance tariffs, working closely with (Trade Minister) Don Farrell and other colleagues to do that.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say the Albanese government was \u201cvery proud of that progress that we\u2019ve been able to make unilaterally, because tariffs push up compliance costs on business\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey risk pushing up prices for workers and families as well,\u201d Mr Chalmers said.\n\n\u201cIf I can build consensus and momentum to go further on that, I would like to, but I\u2019ll do that in a way that works closely with Don Farrell, conscious of the negotiations that he has under way.\n\n\u201cBut I think we\u2019ve shown a willingness and enthusiasm to cut those nuisance tariffs.\n\n\u201cI would like to go further, if I can. They do often do more harm than good, and so we approach the challenge in that light.\u201d\n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened further sectoral tariffs. Picture: Mandel Ngan / AFP\n\nHis comments come as trade talks with the US drag on.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile Australia managed to avoid an increase in US tariffs earlier this month, exports are still subject to blanket 10 per cent levies.\n\nSome sectors, such as steel and aluminium, have rates of up to 50 per cent.\n\nThe US President has also threatened to slap imposts of 250 per cent on foreign pharmaceuticals \u2013 a move that would hit Australian producers hard.\n\nThe Albanese government has repeatedly labelled tariffs \u201ceconomic self-harm\u201d.\n\nMr Chalmers did not specify which products he considered slumped with nuisance tariffs, but he did say \u201cthere\u2019s hundreds\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn those first 500 that we abolished, there were a lot of instances where it costs more actually to levy the tariff than to the benefit that we get from it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not prepared to put a number on any additional steps that we might be prepared to take, but this has been a pretty constant interest of mine.\u201d",
