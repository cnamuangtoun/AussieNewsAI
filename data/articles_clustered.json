    "text": "A US federal appeals court has ruled that Donald Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs on almost every country on earth, but left in place for now his effort to build a protectionist wall around the American economy.\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Trump wasn't legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on almost every nation, a ruling that largely upheld a May decision by a specialised federal trade court in New York.\n\n\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the judges wrote in a 7-4 ruling.\n\nThe ruling complicates Trump's ambitions to upend decades of American trade policy completely on his own. (Getty)\n\nBut they did not strike down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US president vowed to do just that. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump had acted lawfully, and \"we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter.\"\n\nAn attorney for small businesses affected by the tariffs, on the other hand, said the ruling shows Trump doesn't have unlimited power to impose tariffs on his own.\n\n\"This decision protects American businesses and consumers from the uncertainty and harm caused by these unlawful tariffs,\" said Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Centre.\n\nPutting pressure on allies\n\nThe ruling complicates Trump's ambitions to upend decades of American trade policy completely on his own.\n\nTrump has alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.\n\nHis tariffs \u2014 and the erratic way he's rolled them out \u2014 have shaken global markets, alienated US trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.\n\nBut he's also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting one-sided trade deals and to bring tens of billions of dollars into the federal Treasury to help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\n\n\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.\n\nThe government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the US Treasury.\n\n\"It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!\" Trump said in a previous post on Truth Social.\n\nA dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the US president.\n\nRevenue from tariffs now totals $159 billion, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.\n\nIndeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the United States.\n\nWhat tariffs are in question\n\nThe ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA):\n\n\u2014The sweeping tariffs he announced April 2 \u2014 \"Liberation Day,'' he called it \u2014 when he imposed \"reciprocal'' tariffs of up to 50 per cent on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits and a \"baseline'' 10 per cent tariff on just about everyone else. Those tariff rates have since been revised by Trump, in some cases after trade negotiations, and generally went into effect August 7.\n\nThe national emergency underlying the tariffs, Trump said, was the long-running gap between what the US sells and what it buys from the rest of the world.\n\nThe US president started to levy modified the tariff rates in August, but goods from countries with which the US runs a surplus also face the taxes.\n\nThe \"trafficking tariffs'' he announced on February 1 on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, and later refined.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency power law does not authorize the use of tariffs. (Getty)\n\nThese were designed to get those countries to do more to stop what he declared a national emergency: the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across their borders into the United States.\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over decades, lawmakers have ceded authorities to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.\n\nBut Trump's assertion that IEEPA essentially gives him unlimited power to tax imports quickly drew legal challenges at least seven cases.\n\nNo president had ever used the law to justify tariffs, though IEEPA had been used frequently to impose export restrictions and other sanctions on US adversaries such as Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency power law does not authorise the use of tariffs.\n\nThey also noted that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \"unusual and extraordinary'' threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law.\n\nThe United States, after all, has run trade deficits in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them for 49 straight years, and in good times and bad.\n\nEmergency powers\n\nThe Trump administration argued that courts approved former US President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis that arose from the chaos that followed his decision to end a policy linking the US dollar to the price of gold.\n\nThe Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.\n\nIn May, the US Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges, one by five businesses and one by 12 US states, into a single case.\n\nIn the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA's requirement that they \"deal with'' the problem they were supposed to address.\n\nThe court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminium, and autos that the US president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to US national security.\n\nThe court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminium and autos (Getty)\n\nNor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term, and Former US president Joe Biden kept, after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.\n\nTrump could potentially cite alternative authorities to impose import taxes, though they are more limited.\n\nSection 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for instance, allows the US president to tax imports from countries with which the US runs big trade deficits at 15 per cent for 150 days.",

    "text": "From Kath and Kim and Dance Academy, to the latest sensation Bluey, Australia's film and television industry has delivered hit shows and movies.\n\nBut the filmmakers behind them say more needs to be done to increase production of Australian content.\n\nContent quotas, which require media platforms to create and include a certain amount of locally-made material, have long applied to free-to-air broadcasters, but changes made during the COVID pandemic allowed networks to prioritise genres that are cheaper to produce, like sport and reality TV.\n\nThat has come at the expense of creative genres, like children's programs, drama and documentaries.\n\nFilmmakers had hoped the federal government's plans to introduce content quotas for streaming services would help revitalise the industry, but they say delays and concerns the reforms will not go ahead are hurting the sector.\n\nHaving content quotas would force streaming services to invest in the creation of a certain amount of Australian content. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nProducer says quotas could lead to 'bigger industry than we had before'\n\nThe executive producer and director of Tasmanian animation business Blue Rocket, David Gurney, said the changes made to local content quotas for free-to-air broadcasters had been \"tragic\".\n\n\"The permanent staff got laid off, all the actors [and] the other contractors who worked for the company \u2014 we weren't able to employ them anymore.\n\n\"And the studio had to physically close down as well.\n\n\" [There were] people saving up to buy a house who then couldn't. \"\n\nDavid Gurney says the changes made to content quotas for free-to-air broadcasters had been \"tragic\". (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nBut Mr Gurney said Australian content regulation for streaming services would \"transform the industry significantly\" and could make up for the changes in requirements for free-to-air broadcasters.\n\n\"If it was implemented properly \u2026 [it] could actually give us an even bigger industry than we had before,\" he said.\n\nA report from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) found a 98 per cent decrease in commercial network spend on children's drama between 2018-19 and 2023-24.\n\nKath & Kim became an Australian hit TV show. (Supplied)\n\nOther genres have also declined, with the spend on adult drama almost 50 per cent less than it was in 2018-19.\n\n\"This was sustainable business that employed a lot of people, and now it's very difficult to find a way forward without having consistent productions.\" Mr Gurney said.\n\n\"All the educational institutions that are training people up to do these jobs, they're now training them up for phantom jobs that don't exist.\n\n\"It is destroying people's aspirations and their careers\".\n\nDavid Gurney says content quotas for streaming services would \"transform\" the Australian screen industry. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nWaiting on the government to call, 'action!'\n\nIn 2023, Arts Minister Tony Burke said he intended to bring in local content quotas for streaming platforms from July 2024.\n\nAustralian content rules for streaming giants put on ice Photo shows A smart tv with various streaming app logos on display. The federal government has quietly delayed plans to introduce local content requirements for major streaming platforms, with no indication of when it might return to work on the policy.\n\nThe quotas would require platforms like Netflix and Disney+ to invest in the creation of Australian films and television programs.\n\nBut the legislation has been shelved.\n\nMr Burke told the ABC the regulation was still needed, but did not provide any update on timelines or reasons for the delay.\n\nIt is understood Australia's free trade agreement with the United States has been a stumbling block.\n\nBluey is one of Australia's screen success stories. (Supplied: ABC)\n\n\"I've been arguing for this reform since 2013,\" Mr Burke said.\n\n\"It's taking longer than I wanted but I know we need this to ensure our stories are always on our screens.\"\n\nThe ABC contacted Disney+, Binge, Netflix and Stan to ask whether they supported the introduction of Australian local content quotas on their streaming service. Only Netflix responded.\n\n\"Netflix doesn't oppose regulation. We are on the ground and investing heavily because our members value great local storytelling, and we are committed to making quality Australian content that our members will love,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nNetflix says it doesn't oppose regulation. ( Unsplash: Jonas Leupe)\n\nSurvey shows filmmakers significantly affected by delays\n\nA recent member survey from Screen Producers Australia found that 79 per cent of its members believed their business had been directly affected by the lack of regulation.\n\nWhen asked if they felt more or less optimistic about the future of the screen industry compared with a year ago, 81.2 per cent said they felt less optimistic.\n\nMatthew Deaner says not having a regulatory framework sets \"our people on edge\". (Supplied: Screen Producers Australia)\n\nScreen Producers Australia chief executive Matthew Deaner said the impacts felt by the industry were \"a significant concern\".\n\nMr Deaner said the film industry was already an industry that could be uncertain.\n\n\"But that overall hanging problem of no regulatory framework sets \u2026 our people on edge because it says that we don't know whether [we] will have a full industry for Australian content in the future.\"\n\nSara Ellis Holland says the introduction of content quotas for streaming services would provide opportunities for creative people. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nActor and acting teacher Sara Ellis Holland said content quotas for streaming platforms would enable a \"revitalisation\" for the film and television industry.\n\n\"There are so many people working in other jobs where they're not utilising [their creative] skills \u2026 and wouldn't it be great to see what will blossom when we're all put to work,\" she said.\n\nMr Gurney said the delays meant some companies had already \"packed up and given up\".\n\nMatthew Deaner said the \"longer we delay, the harder it will be to get our industry back on track\".",

His scheme included an elaborate cover story filled with grandiose promises, fake court cases and fabricated legal documents.\n\nAfter pleading guilty to theft and gaining financial advantage by deception, Supreme Court Justice Rita Incerti said it was \"inevitable\" Hadjina would be jailed.\n\nHadjina cried at the back of the courtroom, clutching a black bag of his belongings, as his lawyer asked for the prison term to be delayed.\n\nThis was so he could be assessed by a psychologist and properly farewell his loved ones, barrister James Anderson said.\n\n\"Mr Hadjina disclosed to his wife for the first time this morning the circumstances in which he is in,\" Mr Anderson said on Tuesday.\n\n\"There is certainly a pitiful element to that, and both my instructor and I were present for the phone call.\n\n\" He hasn't said any of the goodbyes he ought to have said to his family; to his children, his wife, his parents. \"\n\nDespite prosecutors' requests for Hadjina to be taken into custody immediately, Justice Incerti agreed to continue his bail for another three weeks.\n\nShe urged him to \"assist your lawyers in presenting your case\".\n\n\"This has gone on long enough.

    "text": "Outside the West End State School, a group of parents and concerned residents gathered on Friday to express their anger at a proposal to build a 16-storey, 132-unit apartment building on the opposite side of Vulture Street.\n\n\"We have a lot of development in our area, but this one is literally on our doorstep,\" Vanessa Bertagnole, the head of the school's Parents and Citizens group told the media.\n\nVanessa Bertagnole and her daughter Zana are concerned social infrastructure isn't keeping pace with development. (ABC News: Will Murray)\n\n\"The developments are outstripping the social infrastructure to support them, and that's what we're really concerned about.\"\n\nA recent report released by the Brisbane Economic Development Agency forecast Brisbane's population will grow 2.1 per cent year-on-year until 2046.\n\nPlanning experts say housing millions of extra people is going to require significant development, and hard decisions about protecting character versus meeting demand will need to be made.\n\nThe community has concerns new developments will overshadow nearby 'character' homes. (ABC News: Will Murray)\n\n'Guidelines' create confusion\n\nAt the protest in West End, many of the signs held by those gathered complain the development is \"double\" the local height limit and would loom over the surrounding area.\n\n\"It's planned to be 16 storeys high, this area is zoned for eight storeys,\" Ms Bertagnole said.\n\nA look at the planning scheme would appear to confirm that a limit of eight storeys does apply to that part of West End.\n\nWest End is zoned for a maximum eight storeys, but Dr Mark Limb says the rules are more like 'guidelines'. (ABC News: Will Murray)\n\nHowever, as Mark Limb, lecturer in urban planning at QUT explained, the state uses what's called a \"performance-based\" planning system, which makes things a lot less clear-cut.\n\n\"It means those 'rules' are more like guidelines,\" Dr Limb said.\n\n\"A developer could potentially make an argument that the building is five or 10 storeys higher than what it says in the guideline, however it's still achieving the intended outcome of the planning scheme.\"\n\nDr Mark Limb says any buildings above the height limit need to undergo an impact assessment. (Supplied)\n\nIn practice, that means there is no hard and fast height limit, but anything above the guidelines must undergo an \"impact assessment\", which triggers much closer examination and public scrutiny.\n\nWhile Dr Limb said this can be frustrating for residents \u2014 who believe \"something dodgy is happening\" when buildings outside the rules are approved \u2014 it's designed to give developers confidence.\n\n\"If you meet with the standards that are specified within the various codes of the planning scheme, [the development] must be approved.\n\n\"If you want to go further \u2026 that's when the [impact assessment process] kicks in, which opens up the right for the community to lodge submissions.\"\n\nDevelopments undergoing an impact assessment require community engagement. (ABC News: Will Murray)\n\nUp versus out\n\nAcross the river in Toowong, developers Verso Projects recently submitted a development application (DA) to build three towers on a partially empty block.\n\nThe Toowong Central towers are between 49 and 58 storeys and will include about 1,000 units in total.\n\nThree towers are planned for the Toowong Central development and will require an impact assessment. (Supplied)\n\nThey are a lot taller than the planning scheme \"guidelines\" allow and so will require an impact assessment.\n\nSteve Laffey, CEO of Verso Projects, said they could have opted for a design very similar to a rival DA previously approved for the site.\n\nHowever, he argued the community would be worse off.\n\nSteve Laffey says the change from six towers to three will allow for more public space. (Supplied)\n\n\"We've gone from six towers on the site to three towers,\" he said.\n\n\"We end up with about five-and-a-half thousand square metres of open space available to the public, which is about 40 per cent of the site area.\n\n\"If we went back to the code compliant DA that we might have lodged, you would only end up with sort of 1,500 square metres of public space.\"\n\nVery similar complaints have been made about the Toowong and Vulture Street proposals.\n\nThey include that the developments will create more traffic in already busy areas, that there's no provision for social or affordable housing, and they will create overcrowding at local schools.\n\nAn artist's impression of the proposed development at Vulture Street in West End. (Supplied)\n\nMr Laffey said the company acknowledged these concerns, but said developers can't be expected to fund the solutions entirely.\n\n\"At some point there's a breaking point in terms of what's financial and what's not.\n\n\"If we're asked to do too much, then it's not financial, then it's never going to happen, and the community is not going to get an outcome it so desperately needs.\"\n\nHard decisions ahead\n\nFor city planners like Dr Limb, there's a lot to be said for higher density in inner-city areas.\n\n\"We have some of the most sprawling cities on the planet in Australia, which is truly inefficient and pushes people further and further away from essential services.\n\nCould the rising YIMBY movement increase housing supply? Photo shows an outside view of a row of houses Property prices surged once again in April due the ongoing shortage of housing and rising demand. Could the rise of the YIMBY \u2014 or the \"yes in my back yard\" \u2014 movement be the solution to boosting the supply of affordable housing?\n\n\"(Denser urban areas) can create more vibrant spaces, more walkable spaces\u2026 (and) it can increase the demand for better forms of public transport.\"\n\nBut he said Brisbane doesn't have a lot of space for higher-density development close to the city, and therefore some re-zoning is inevitable.\n\nNicole Bennetts, the Queensland manager of the Planning Institute of Australia, said adding millions of residents doesn't have to destroy Brisbane's character, it can be achieved through \"gentle density.\"\n\n\"Our planning instruments don't currently enable a lot of housing diversity in low density residential suburbs.\n\n\"What we, as planners, would like to have conversations with the community about is maybe introducing some duplexes or some triplexes.\"\n\nNicole Bennetts says \"gentle density\" can help increase housing without affecting the character of the city. (Supplied)\n\nMs Bennetts said these kinds of homes can be built to retain their backyards, the \"timber and tin\" look, and their tree-lined streets.\n\nShe urged people to not just look at development as a cost to the community.\n\n\"When growth occurs in an area, infrastructure investment can then come in to support upgrades to schools, hospitals, footpaths and other essential services that are needed.",

    "text": "America's best men's singles hope, Ben Shelton, has made a tearful exit from the US Open during his third-round match because of a left shoulder injury.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Shelton, a two-time major semifinalist, stopped after dropping the fourth set against Adrian Mannarino, which forced a fifth and decisive set. The injury was perhaps caused when he landed on his left arm after tracking down a ball in the corner on the final point to win the third set.\n\nEarly in the fourth, the 2023 US Open semifinalist began wincing and said to his coach's box: \"I did something to my shoulder. I don't know what it is.\"\n\nHe received treatment in the middle of the set, where the trainer rubbed some cream on his left shoulder, and he tried to shorten the points afterward by consistently attacking the net.\n\nBut after Mannarino won the set, Shelton was visited again by the trainer and called off the match, leaving the court with a towel over his head and tears in his eyes.\n\nThe game ended with Mannarino advancing 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.\n\nMannarino, a 37-year-old from France, ended up with his first victory in 23 career matches against matches against top-10 players in Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n\"When he started to have pain, he was leading in the match,\" Mannarino said. \"Honestly, he would have probably won that match.\"\n\nShelton was certainly a heavy favourite in it after coming in with a 14-2 record this summer on hard courts and winning the title in Toronto, where he routed Mannarino early in the tournament.\n\nShelton was one of the best hopes to give the US its first men's major champion since Andy Roddick won the 2003 US Open.\n\nAnother of them, number 17 seed Frances Tiafoe \u2014 who had reached the semifinals in Flushing Meadows in two of the previous three years \u2014 was eliminated with a 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (9/7) loss to German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz had to take a medical timeout to have attention for his right knee, but the Spanish star still advanced to the fourth round. (AP: Yuki Iwamura)\n\nMeanwhile Carlos Alcaraz marched on at Flushing Meadows, insisting there was no need for concern after he needed treatment on his right knee during an otherwise trouble-free demolition of Italian Luciano Darderi at the US Open.\n\nAfter having his serve broken for the first time and also requiring the physio to treat him near the end of the second set, it felt like perhaps this could be the first wobble for the stellar Spaniard at this year's New York major.\n\nYet it really didn't look that way as the 22-year-old pummelled Darderi 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 to waltz into the fourth round while still not having dropped a set so far.\n\nAnd he was quick to assure everyone after his one-hour 44-minute victory that there was nothing to worry about after he had taken a medical timeout at 5-4 in the second set following a nervous moment when he jolted his knee while landing awkwardly off a serve.\n\n\"I'm feeling good,\" he told the Arthur Ashe Stadium fans after treating them to 31 spectacular winners. \"It was just a precaution that I asked for the physio.\n\n\"When he broke my serve [with Alcaraz leading 4-1 in the second set] in the last point, I felt something in the knee, but after five or six points it was gone. I just asked the physio to take care of the knee, so I had to be feeling good.\n\n\"I am going to talk to my team about it, but I'm feeling good.\"\n\nSo good indeed that he reeled off the last seven games after the time-out to set up a fourth-round clash with Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who beat his compatriot, Daniil Medvedev's conqueror, Benjamin Bonzi, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.\n\n\"I just played such great tennis, great performance in general, so I'm just really proud about it,\" said Alcaraz, who continued his extraordinary run of form which has seen him rack up 42 wins against just two defeats since April.\n\nHe hasn't really made a mistake all week, apart from letting his brother cut his hair. Even his celebratory golf swing after his victory didn't look too shabby.\n\nNot even an early start could faze him. \"I just tried to start awake, that was important,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Starting at 11:30am is not a schedule that I'm used to playing, so my first goal is to start well, to start focused. I think I started really well, pushing him to the limit, playing long rallies, and after that kept it going.\n\n\"I'm not a morning person. For me, it's difficult to wake up in the mornings, so that's a good thing today, that I woke up early, I did the warm-up well, played good \u2026 It seems like I'm a Spanish guy!\"\n\nAmerican fourth seed Jessica Pegula defeated twice Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka 6-1, 7-5.\n\n2021 champion Emma Raducanu had no answer to the play of ninth seed Elena Rybakina on Louis Armstrong Stadium. (AP: Kirsty Wigglesworth)\n\nEmma Raducanu has shown signs of improvement this year, reaching the US Open third round for the first time since her 2021 triumph, but it was not enough to get past ninth seed Elena Rybakina, who cruised to a 6-1, 6-2 win on Louis Armstrong Stadium.\n\n\"It's going to be important to just look at the last few months as a whole, last few weeks as a whole, and the improvements that I'm making, because a match like that can easily kind of get you down if you let it,\" said Raducanu, who had failed to win a match in her last two visits to the hardcourt major.\n\n\"So I'm going to try and not do that and regroup.\"\n\nRybakina, who triumphed at Wimbledon three years ago, reached the US Open fourth round for the first time and will next play Czech Marketa Vondrousova.\n\nVondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon winner, eliminated Italian seventh seed Jasmine Paolini 7-6 (7/4), 6-1.\n\nNovak Djokovic will be hoping to get another step closer to an elusive 25th Grand Slam title when he looks to extend his 6-0 win-loss record over 35th-ranked Cameron Norrie in the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe former world number one readily admits that he has lost some of his fire after claiming his last major at the 2023 US Open, with the 38-year-old failing to reach the final at any of the slams for over a year.\n\nTeenaged fifth seed Mirra Andreeva, who claimed a pair of 1000-level titles earlier this year, plays American Taylor Townsend in the final match of the night on Ashe.\n\nOthers in action include world number one and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka, who plays Canadian 31st seed Leylah Fernandez.\n\nFernandez defeated Sabalenka during her remarkable run to the 2021 final and will hope that lightning strikes again on Friday.\n\nAP/AAP/Reuters",

    "text": "Not one healthcare professional raised the possibility that Phillips may have had endometriosis. Had they guessed, Phillips wondered, would they have taken her pain more seriously?\n\nNo one had investigated the source of the pain or her intense nausea and, eventually, anaemia, Phillips said.\n\n\u201cI was really confused,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBut I had seen so many doctors that I just started to believe them.\u201d\n\nIt did not need to come to this. Over two years, Phillips had described pain that would \u201cliterally stop me in my tracks\u201d to more than 10 GPs, a gastroenterologist and staff at a hospital emergency department.\n\nThe aggressive growth was one thin layer of soft tissue away from causing a complete rupture and potentially life-threatening sepsis.\n\nIt was the size of a golf ball and threatening to rip through Olivia Phillips\u2019 bowel.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\n\u201cWe have women calling our helpline haemorrhaging in the bathroom, and they say, \u2018The GP has told me that this is normal\u2019,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cNormal? How is haemorrhaging in the bathroom normal?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are still, in 2025, hearing that women are not being believed about their symptoms,\u201d said Jess Taylor, chair of the Australian Coalition of Endometriosis and CEO of advocacy body QENDO.\n\n\u201cFor so long we\u2019ve seen this gaslighting that\u2019s described by patients, where they\u2019ve presented to a health care provider with a set of symptoms, and they\u2019ve been told it\u2019s in their head, or it\u2019s normal, when it\u2019s not,\u201d said Jason Abbott, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of NSW and chair of the National Endometriosis Clinical and Scientific Trials (NECST) network.\n\nOne woman\u2019s endometrial lesions had all but killed her kidney before her pain was properly investigated. Another said her symptoms were dismissed as normal, despite period pain so severe that she had fainted and knocked her front teeth out. Others were prescribed anxiety medication and diagnosed with depression with no investigation into the physical cause of their distress.\n\nAmong them were dozens who described being turned away from emergency departments, delays in diagnosis spanning years \u2013 or decades \u2013 that robbed them of the chance to have children, and having their pain dismissed as a normal part of womanhood.\n\nEndometriosis was the single most common disease among more than 2000 accounts of medical misogyny shared by Australian women with this masthead: more than 200 women with the progressive, chronic disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other parts of the body.\n\n\u201cIt was the only way for my body to remove waste,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing I was eating was staying down.\u201d\n\nBy 2020, two years after Phillips first sought help, she couldn\u2019t sleep for the pain. The 27-year-old could no longer pass bowel movements. She was vomiting so frequently that she was rapidly losing weight.\n\nLost in translation are the research breakthroughs that take years to be adopted in practice, and doctors\u2019 well-meaning but poorly delivered advice that leaves patients feeling dismissed.\n\nHealthcare professionals are reliant on endometriosis research that is 30 years behind conditions such as breast cancer, despite the condition affecting an estimated one in seven Australian women before the age of 50. It takes an average 6.5 years for women to be diagnosed after first experiencing symptoms.\n\nThe women, clinicians, researchers and advocates who spoke out for this investigation largely blame the systemic gender bias of a healthcare system rooted in medical research that has for centuries skewed male.\n\n\u201cI cried,\u201d said Phillips, now a mother of two \u2013 Noah, 3, and Goldie, 10 months. \u201cIt was a relief that finally I knew what it was and I could fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear how profoundly your symptoms impacted your quality of life,\u201d Nikam later wrote to Phillips, \u201cfrom years of debilitating pain and multiple dismissive consultations to the extreme measures you had to resort to just to manage [your] symptoms.\u201d\n\nNikam, with a specialised team, performed emergency surgery to remove the large lesion and seven centimetres of Phillips\u2019 bowel.\n\nPhillips had extensive, deep-infiltrating endometriosis: the most advanced presentation of the condition.\n\nA colleague, seeing her in this state, convinced her to push for a referral for a colonoscopy. It revealed a large pelvic mass compressing her bowel.\n\n\u201cBut we have to be very careful that this doesn\u2019t turn women away from all doctors. We should be encouraging women to seek out health care, and if they do, unfortunately, encounter misogyny, then try somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there is medical misogyny,\u201d said Professor Danielle Mazza, chair of general practice at Monash University and a member of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.\n\nBut the challenge, researchers and advocates say, will be how effectively these advancements can gain traction at the coalface, where healthcare workers and patients are up against decades of entrenched dogma.\n\nIn the past year alone, Sydney hosted the World Congress of Endometriosis, UNSW announced a world-first endometriosis research institute , the federal government funded an expansion of specialised clinics and subsidised treatments , and endometriosis ultrasounds, and new clinical guidelines are expected to speed up delays in diagnosis.\n\nSignificant strides have been made in the past decade towards filling the knowledge gaps for this chronically under-researched and underfunded disease, due to the dogged advocacy of patients, researchers and clinicians.\n\nDiagnosis: Normal\n\nThat endometriosis is a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for women\u2019s reproductive organs \u2013 is one of the most harmful, pervasive myths of the condition, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cEndometriosis is a multi-system, complex, chronic condition,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to crack open that conversation \u2026 so women are taken seriously when they say, \u2018What about my bowel, my bladder, I\u2019m disabled because of this condition\u2019.\u201d\n\nDr Jane Chalmers, senior lecturer in pain sciences at the University of South Australia, said the default has been to assume endometriosis pain is \u201cjust part of women\u2019s experience\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is such a common story \u2026 People are still dismissed. They have their pain normalised,\u201d said Chalmers, who also leads the pelvic pain component of the Innovation, Implementation and Clinical Translation in Health (IIMPACT) initiative at UniSA.\n\nFor women with endometriosis, fame and near-endless monetary resources have proven to be no defence against being dismissed by healthcare professionals.\n\nAustralian conservationist and television personality Bindi Irwin had a decade-long battle to get a diagnosis. She said one doctor told her the pain \u201cwas simply something you deal with as a woman\u201d.\n\n\u201cI felt lesser. I felt hurt. I felt weak. That is not OK,\u201d Irwin, 27, wrote on social media this month. \u201cYoung girls and women shouldn\u2019t feel alone with pain in the driver\u2019s seat of their lives.\u201d\n\nAbbott said this confluence of \u201cnormal\u201d menstrual pain with abnormal, severe and life-impairing pain is at the heart of the issue.\n\n\u201cAs a man, if I had cyclic chest pain and I went to the emergency department, you can bet your bottom dollar that I would be investigated in a heartbeat,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only am I a man [who is] presenting with the pain, but I actually don\u2019t have a system in my body that, as part of its normal process, produces pain.\n\n\u201cIf patients are coming, and they\u2019re relaying to us symptoms that are not being improved with current management, then you need to acknowledge and respond to that, rather than relegating it to \u2018that\u2019s a normal process\u2019, \u2018you just need to get over it\u2019.\u201d\n\nJess Taylor said one of the most harmful myths about endometriosis was that it was just a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d.\n\nTaylor described the case of a woman with endometriosis who presented to an emergency department in February with a ruptured ovary.\n\n\u201cThey told her to just go home, take ibuprofen and paracetamol. \u2018You have got pelvic pain, it should go away\u2019,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nIt\u2019s a common story among endo patients when over-the-counter painkillers don\u2019t touch the sides of their symptoms, Monica Forlano, board chair of Endometriosis Australia, said.\n\n\u201cWomen will pass out from the pain \u2013 they\u2019ll go to emergency and request stronger meds and be treated like drug seekers,\u201d Forlano said.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to the myth that pain is women\u2019s lot in life, and that\u2019s what makes them the weaker, fairer sex.\u201d\n\nLoading\n\nChalmers said the consistent theme of the report from a landmark South Australian parliamentary inquiry into endometriosis was the emphasis on improving practitioner training.\n\n\u201cPeople recognise that health practitioners are the gatekeepers. They\u2019re the ones that someone presents to, and they are then either dismissed and normalised or they are sent on the path to recovery,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018If I can be gaslit, anyone can\u2019\n\nLindsay Tuggle\u2019s endometriosis went undetected for more than a decade of unexplained pain, five failed IVF cycles and a succession of healthcare professionals who didn\u2019t take her seriously, before she finally found a specialist who correctly diagnosed her endometriosis.\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t believing me,\u201d the literary scholar and author said. \u201cIt was a dark period where I just thought, you know, I was going a bit crazy.\u201d\n\nLindsay Tuggle\u2019s pain from an endometriosis lesion was written off as the effects of her desk job.

She was 43 years old.\n\nThe excruciating pain when she sat down was caused by lesions that had wrapped around the sacral nerves at the base of her spine. Her doctors assumed this was due to her long hours working at her desk, Tuggle recalled.\n\n\u201c[They would say]: \u2018This is about the fact that you sit for work, you\u2019re a writer\u2019. When, in fact, I\u2019m very fit. I\u2019m very active. I have a sit-to-stand desk,\u201d she said.\n\nTuggle was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at 29 years old after initially being told by a doctor that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t possibly have PCOS because you\u2019re not fat\u201d.\n\nShe was also diagnosed at 36 with adenomyosis (in which endometrial tissue grows in the muscular wall of the uterus). Both conditions are known to present with endometriosis.\n\n\u201cNo one ever talked to me about endometriosis,\u201d Tuggle said.\n\nShe abandoned her hopes of having children, something she believes was stolen from her by a healthcare system that failed to consider endometriosis as the cause of her unexplained pain and IVF failures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m medically literate,\u201d Tuggle said. \u201cIf I can be medically gaslit, it can happen to anyone.\u201d\n\n\u2018Absolute absence of information\u2019\n\nWhen Professor Caroline Ford, lead researcher of Gynaecological Cancer Research Group at UNSW, began searching endometriosis literature four years ago, she found \u201can absolute absence of information\u201d.\n\n\u201c[If] we don\u2019t understand the basic biology of half the population and what the hell is going on, then how on earth can we possibly provide good care for people and good advice?\u201d Ford said.\n\nAn infamous 2013 study published in one of the world\u2019s most influential fertility medical journals judged the attractiveness of women with endometriosis without the consent of participants.\n\nThis peer-reviewed and Milan University-funded paper concluded women with rectovaginal endometriosis \u201cwere judged to be more attractive\u201d, leaner, larger-breasted and were younger when they first had sex compared to women in control groups.\n\nThe journal retracted the paper seven years later, after sustained criticism, at the request of the authors.\n\n\u201cWhen we say \u2018medical misogyny\u2019, it\u2019s a misogyny in funding and research,\u201d said Dr Nisha Khot, president-elect of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG).\n\n\u201cDoctors can only do what they can do within the system they work in. We are relying on things that lack evidence behind them.\u201d\n\nThe $50 million Ainsworth Endometriosis Research Institute (AERI), announced by UNSW in May and led by Ford and Abbott, is a key pillar in Australia\u2019s world-leading efforts to fund and pioneer endometriosis research.\n\nChalmers said there was a \u201chuge delay\u201d \u2013 at least 15 years \u2013 for research findings to translate to changes in clinical practice.\n\n\u201cIf [a practitioner] is not someone who is upskilling in that area, they will continue doing that same sort of normalisation and dismissal until they know better,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, unproven, unfounded medical myths have filled the void.\n\n\u201c[Women are] being thrown all of these ideas completely not grounded in evidence because these individual health professionals don\u2019t have the education, and women are making significant life choices based on that,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWomen are not being afforded informed consent about their health, about their life choices.\u201d\n\nEndometriosis researchers and clinicians said among the most damaging and prevalent misconceptions are the reliance on a narrow list of symptoms that conceal the true extent and variation in presentations of the condition. Equally, the belief that symptoms are a cyclical and inevitable part of being a woman, which will spontaneously resolve in time.\n\nOther diehard myths are that teenagers don\u2019t get endometriosis, laparoscopy is the one-size-fits-all treatment, and that pregnancy is curative.\n\n\u201cPrescribing pregnancy as a treatment for endometriosis is completely untenable,\u201d said Abbott, who is also the clinical director of AERI.\n\nRebecca Ballesteros, 35, was advised by a doctor that having a baby would relieve her symptoms. Credit: Wolter Peeters\n\nBut that\u2019s just what Rebecca Ballesteros said her gynaecologist did.\n\nThe 35-year-old has never wanted children. But when she sought help for her heavy bleeding and period pain, the specialist said she probably had endometriosis, but it wasn\u2019t worth undergoing surgery and she should \u201chave a baby instead. Most of the time it helps,\u201d Ballesteros recalled.\n\n\u201cI was shocked and upset at the suggestion that I should have and raise a child to maybe help with chronic pain,\u201d she said.\n\nA 2023 Australian study based on a survey of 3347 people diagnosed with endometriosis found almost two-thirds had been advised to get pregnant or have a baby to treat their condition, the vast majority (89.4 per cent) by a healthcare professional.\n\nLesley (left) and Sylvia Freedman are founders of EndoActive. Credit: Sam Mooy\n\nSylvia Freedman, co-founder of EndoActive with her mother, Lesley, and a study co-author, said this advice was often given to patients when they saw their doctors for pain management.\n\n\u201cIt should have absolutely nothing to do with having a child,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unethical and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, endometriosis can cause infertility. It\u2019s estimated 30 to 50 per cent of women with the condition struggle to get pregnant.\n\nAbbott said pregnancy may temporarily reduce endometriosis symptoms because it paused a woman\u2019s menstrual cycles, \u201cwhich the pill can also do\u201d, combined with high progesterone levels and other \u201chappy chemicals\u201d produced by the body as it prepares for childbirth.\n\n\u201cBut as soon as that all stops, symptoms return,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got the endometriosis pain, and the baby, which is a lifelong commitment, certainly not just a prescription.\u201d\n\nMazza said it\u2019s probably the case that some doctors are not fully explaining why pregnancy may alter the course of the disease.\n\n\u201cI think the problem is in the delivery,\u201d Mazza said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re necessarily advising women to rush out and get pregnant, but it\u2019s helping the woman to understand that things that suppress or stop you from menstruating will likely improve endometriosis symptoms, and one of those things is pregnancy.\u201d\n\nFor Abbott: \u201cthe best period is no period\u201d.\n\n\u2018We will cut you open, we will cut it out\u2019\n\nFor some women such as Ballesteros, who spent a year on a public hospital laparoscopy waitlist, surgery can be life-changing.\n\nBut Dr Pav Nanayakkara, a gynaecological surgeon at Melbourne\u2019s Jean Hailes for Women\u2019s Health, said endometriosis could often be linked to numerous conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, meaning treatment may need to be multipronged. She had encountered patients who had laparoscopies, but had been \u201cjust left\u201d when the procedure didn\u2019t fix their pain.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that makes me sad is when patients say they underwent a procedure that they didn\u2019t feel comfortable with, or they didn\u2019t understand what happened to them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLosing trust in the health profession is a really sad thing because then diagnosis can be delayed [and] problems can become more severe.\u201d\n\nChalmers said the overreliance on surgery \u2013 with its associated risks and long, often arduous recovery times \u2013 was a clear example of medical misogyny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2018we will cut you open, we will cut it out, and you will get better.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAbbott said too many women are given no other option.\n\nJason Abbott is a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of NSW. Credit: Sam Mooy\n\n\u201cI certainly see patients who respond to surgery, and then the disease comes back, and it doesn\u2019t respond to medication, and all we can do is more surgery,\u201d he said.\n\nSurgery is \u201cthe law of diminishing returns\u201d, Abbott said. \u201cOne surgery, we know, can be efficacious. Two surgeries, certainly. But I hear stories and I see patients where they say, \u2018I\u2019ve had 30 surgeries and I\u2019m 30 [years old]\u2019. That is way too many. They are quite clearly not responding to surgery.\u201d\n\nIn a major step towards more timely diagnosis and treatment, a new guideline published by RANZCOG in May overturned reliance on surgery to diagnose endometriosis (formerly the gold standard), recommending transvaginal ultrasound as first-line investigation for patients with symptoms.\n\nThe guideline also advised clinicians to offer women first-line treatment (in the form of hormones such as the contraceptive pill and intrauterine devices) while they waited for a diagnosis, as well as painkillers, physiotherapy and psychological support.\n\n\u201cIt makes the whole pathway simpler and more accessible,\u201d said Mazza, who was the RACGP representative on the guideline\u2019s development group, and is working on a management plan to help GPs structure consultations with patients that reflect the guidelines.\n\nBut a complicating factor, Mazza said, was that many women can feel dismissed by doctors who offer hormonal treatments amid a global movement of women moving away from using hormones.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because the GP isn\u2019t explaining why hormonal treatments are being recommended \u2026 but I think there needs to be increased awareness in the community that hormone therapies can be very beneficial for a range of conditions,\u201d Mazza said.\n\nDanielle Mazza supports encouraging women to seek out health care.\n\nOne reason for this shift is the growing evidence of an association with the side effects of hormonal contraception, most commonly low mood.\n\nIf women aren\u2019t responding to hormone treatments or are experiencing side effects, Abbott said simply giving them more is not the answer.\n\nDr Bridget Dickenson, a general practitioner at Jean Hailes for Women\u2019s Health, said she would commonly see women who had been on the contraceptive pill for up to a decade, who, when they come off the pill (perhaps to have a baby) have a resurgence of terrible pain and bleeding.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cThey may get diagnosed with endometriosis, and they have the perception that the pill masked their symptoms and delayed their diagnosis, when the pill was just doing a great job of treating the symptoms,\u201d Dickenson said. \u201cThis is always a bit of a conundrum.\n\n\u201cI always have a conversation when starting these treatments, that in five to 10 years, it may be that you are diagnosed with something like endometriosis. But that just means this treatment has been working for you.\u201d\n\nIf pain and bleeding can be well controlled by hormonal treatments such as the pill, with no side effects and no symptoms of deep-infiltrating endometriosis, it can reduce the number of surgeries (and complications such as adhesions) a woman has over her lifetime, Dickenson explained.\n\nThe key is regular follow-ups to ensure the woman is happy with the treatment, she said.\n\nFundamentally, Mazza said, doctors are products of their society.\n\n\u201cWhere society doesn\u2019t value women, where women are seen as just reproductive bodies and not given respect, that doubtless filters through into consultations with patients,\u201d Mazza said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of levels where misogyny comes into play.\n\n\u201cDoes the system work against women? We don\u2019t have the full range of contraceptive options available on the PBS, ultrasound scans are rebated less than scrotal ultrasounds, hospitals may not have enough gynaecological services when half the population may need them.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mazza said: \u201cThere are fantastic doctors who do great work, and thank goodness for that.\u201d\n\nMEDICAL MISOGYNY: A CALL FOR ACTION The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald last year launched an investigation into medical misogyny: ingrained, systemic sexism across Australia\u2019s healthcare system, medical research and practice. More than 2000 women shared their experiences as part of our crowd-sourced investigative series, which prompted a national outpouring of grief and frustration as women described feeling gaslit, dismissed or being told their pain was \u201call in their heads\u201d. We call on the federal government to boost Medicare funding for GP appointments that last more than 20 minutes to improve care for women and others with complex health conditions. The Albanese government and the Coalition have promised to pour $8.5 billion into Medicare to make GP visits more affordable and improve bulk billing rates, but longer 20-minute appointments will receive a smaller proportional funding increase. Doctors have warned that these policies could further disadvantage women by continuing to incentivise shorter consultations, which don\u2019t give GPs enough time to address menopause, pelvic pain and other women\u2019s health issues.\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

    "text": "As soon as Chloe Molloy ruptured her ACL in September last year, she turned to Swans coach Scott Gowans and said: \u201cI\u2019ll be back stronger and better than ever.\u201d\n\nAnd the player Gowans describes as the Dustin Martin of the women\u2019s competition proved it.\n\nOn Saturday she equalled the record for most goals in an AFLW game with seven, and that was off the back of a starring role in round one.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best female footballer I\u2019ve ever seen, but until you see what she does to prepare for, and recover from, the game, and how she reviews vision\u2026 studies upcoming [opponents] and tactics, you probably don\u2019t understand [that] you\u2019re never going to fail, as such.\u201d\n\nGowans spoke of the look in Molloy\u2019s eyes during their first conversation after her injury last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether she saw doubt in me, or whether she thought I might not believe her\u2026 [but] she had a look in her eye,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThe first run [she had since the injury], she said, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to have a kick\u2019.\n\n\u201cHer first kick was horrible \u2013 it was all over the shop.\u201d\n\nThat was at \u201cabout the five or six-month mark\u201d, Gowans estimates.\n\n\u201cShe followed exactly what the rehab plan was to the letter, which is hard to do as an athlete,\u201d Gowans explained further.\n\n\u201cIt was the extra stuff. She just wouldn\u2019t accept that she can\u2019t do more kilometres\u2026 or get back quicker.\n\n\u201cIt was all about what she could do that didn\u2019t break the rules of rehab \u2013 the touches, the vision and the things like that, the extra ice baths, the extra massages.\n\n\u201cShe just ticked so many boxes and she didn\u2019t miss a beat and came back in pre-season and broke her PB in the time trial, she\u2019s benching and deadlifting record weights for her, she completely changed the way she eats\u2026 you just never doubted her [through her comeback process].\u201d\n\nMolloy even picked the brain of Australian Football Hall of Fame member Erin Phillips about her own injury comebacks.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019ll break the [goals in a single game] record,\u201d Gowans said of his star.\n\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re playing a clutch game or a grand final, she\u2019s the type of person who would thrive on it.\n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t have any doubt at all \u2013 she\u2019s made for the big moments.\n\n\u201c[Her teammates] can see that she leads the way by example, and they just follow her.\n\n\u201cShe brings them into the game as well.\n\n\u201c[And] we put her on the ball in the centre bounce last weekend and she got a couple of clearances, but it was more the velocity and the power\u2026 she breaks lines.\u201d\n\nNow Molloy is dominating to the point that her coach urges anyone with even a fleeting interest in footy to come along and see her in action.\n\n\u201cYou actually go to the game of football just to watch her, regardless of whether you\u2019re a male or female football lover,\u201d Gowans said. \u201cShe drags people through the gates, and people are better for going to see Chloe Molloy play.\u201d",

    "text": "Bulls N\u2019 Bears\u2019 Runner of the Week is African oil and gas hopeful Invictus Energy, which has stirred from its slumber this week with hopes of unlocking its flagship Cabora Bassa project in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe company could be something of a leviathan, having inked a blockbuster deal with Qatar\u2019s Sheikh Mansour for a maxed out 19.9 per cent equity stake for a measly $37.8 million at 9.5c per share. The investment is accompanied by a pivotal US$500 million in conditional future funding to push Invictus\u2019 mammoth Mukuyu gas discovery toward commercial production.\n\nInvictus says it and Al Mansour Holdings will also form Al Mansour Oil & Gas (AMOG), a joint venture to acquire producing and near-term oil and gas assets across Africa, with Invictus handling technical and operational management and Al Mansour providing funding, what a combo.\n\nA representative from Al Mansour will join the Invictus board to cement the partnership, as the long-dormant Cabora Bassa project in Zimbabwe\u2019s Muzarabani Basin looks destined to finally flow gas to the African market.\n\nCabora holds an insane, estimated 20 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas and condensate potential \u2013 that\u2019s trillion with a \u2018T\u2019 - making it one of Africa\u2019s largest undeveloped gas fields.\n\nShares, accordingly surged 145 per cent on Wednesday\u2019s announcement, followed by another rocketing leap of 42.31 per cent on Thursday, to a 12-month high of 18.5c, with $30 million in stock traded.\n\nThat combined uptick added nearly $36 million in paper value to Al Mansour\u2019s holdings - not bad for a couple of days work.\n\nIf AMOG\u2019s M&A spree delivers and Mukuyu flows, Invictus could transform from a rusted-on Zimbabwean junior to a pan-African titan.\n\nBASIN ENERGY LIMITED (ASX: BSN)\n\nUp 220% (2.5c - 8c)\n\nSnagging silver is Canadian-based uranium explorer Basin Energy, after the explorer scooped up private critical minerals company in NeoDys, securing a prime position in northwest Queensland\u2019s Mount Isa region.\n\nNeoDys\u2019 extensive ground lies southwest of the world-renowned Mt Isa, next to Paladin Energy\u2019s Valhalla hard rock uranium deposit \u2013 a hefty 116-million-pound uranium deposit - and Red Metals\u2019 giant Sybella clay rare earths deposit.\n\nThe deal offers three exploration models for Basin in the humming uranium and rare earth critical minerals. From paleochannel uranium to hard-rock rare earths and clay hosted rare earths, the deal comes with a helpful $150,000 Queensland government grant to fund exploration.\n\nThe deal was accompanied by a $1.25 million placement to fund drilling later this year.\n\nAs rare earths and uranium roar back to life, so did Basin\u2019s share price, which rocketed 220 per cent to a high of 8c on $2.5 million in stock traded on Wednesday.\n\nThe company, which listed in late 2022, has its sights set on developing it uranium portfolio housed within the world-class Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada.\n\nHome to giants like Cameco\u2019s McArthur River, Basin\u2019s North Millennium, Geikie and Marshall projects were promised to chase shallow, high-grade uranium, with sniffs of radioactivity uncovered in 2023 before the uranium price cratered last year.\n\nWith Athabasca\u2019s uranium pedigree and Queensland\u2019s dual-play potential, Basin\u2019s low-cost aircore drilling could prove potent. While uranium mining is still currently banned in Queensland, the project\u2019s rare earths prospects could quickly turn out massive resources like Red Metal\u2019s multi-billion tonne clay rare earths deposit next door. The upside on this new style of mineralisation remains unknown but should the economics prove positive at Red Metal, the district will be set alight in an area dominated by both Red Metal and now Basin.\n\nARK MINES LIMITED (ASX: AHK)\n\nUp 192% (18.5c \u2013 54c)\n\nTaking bronze is Ark Mines Limited, another junior explorer targeting \u2013 you guessed it - rare earths and even heavy mineral sands to supply the West\u2019s clean energy transition technologies.\n\nThe company received a massive boost to its potential this week in the form of a $4.5 million handout from the Queensland Investment Corp (QIC) Critical Minerals and Battery Technology Fund for its Sandy Mitchell project 230 kilometres northwest of Cairns.\n\nThe funding consists of a $4 million royalty-tied capital injection and a $500,000 equity investment at 16.7c - following extensive due diligence by the QIC, which manages a whopping $131.2 billion portfolio.\n\nArk says the cash will fast-track a stage-3 infill drilling program and a prefeasibility study at Sandy, targeting production by late 2027.\n\nSandy Mitchell hosts a measured resource of 71.8 million tonnes at 1732 parts per million (ppm) monazite equivalent, with an exploration target of 1.3\u20131.5 billion tonnes at 1286\u20131903 ppm.\n\nThe project\u2019s monazite-rich sands contain key magnet REEs including neodymium and praseodymium, both vital for EV motors and wind turbines. Its shallow, open-pit-friendly deposit and Queensland\u2019s infrastructure also support low-cost mining.\n\nA scoping study estimates a $120\u2013150 million development cost, with annual EBITDA of $45\u201353 million and approximately 80 local jobs. Shares soared 192 per cent to a three-year high of 54c on $870k in stock traded.\n\nAnd while monazite-rich sands contain key magnet REEs like neodymium and praseodymium, vital for EV motors and wind turbines, and Ark\u2019s shallow, open-pit-friendly deposit and Queensland\u2019s infrastructure support low-cost mining, scaling a billion-tonne dream in remote terrain is no walk in the park.\n\nAligned with Australia\u2019s push for supply chain security amid global REE shortages, Sandy Mitchell\u2019s massive exploration target could make it a globally significant hub, but environmental and logistical hurdles in Cape York\u2019s rugged landscape remain.\n\nTechGen Metals Limited has identified two parallel high-grade copper gossans and iron quartz gold zones at its Blue Devil project, 40km northeast of Halls Creek in Western Australia.\n\nTECHGEN METALS LIMITED (ASX: TG1)\n\nUp 165% (2c \u2013 5.3c)\n\nRounding out this week\u2019s Runners is copper-gold hopeful TechGen Metals, which was shot out of a cannon this week after it identified two parallel high-grade copper gossans and iron quartz gold zones, just 80m apart, at its Blue Devil project, 40km northeast of Halls Creek in the Halls Creek Orogen.\n\nRock chip samples along a 2km east-west corridor returned grades up to 52.3 per cent copper, 22.6 per cent copper and 5.35 grams per tonne (g/t) gold.\n\nThe Blue Devil project has never been drill-tested, giving TechGen a rare greenfield opportunity to deliver a potentially significant copper-gold discovery, with key targets stretching nearly 3km.\n\nThe company says a critically important heritage survey with the Jaru People is now complete, with tenure granting imminent and an IP survey planned to refine its 2.75km intrusion-related target in the winds.\n\nAs gold prices soared so did TechGens market cap, flying up a staggering 165 per cent to a high of 5.3c on $4.5 million in stock traded.\n\nThe mineralised hotspot is known for structural complexity and rich deposits. Notable projects include IGO\u2019s Halls Creek copper-zinc revival.\n\nShould Blue Devil\u2019s high-grade surface results and undrilled status position it as a major greenfields discovery in the surging red and yellow metal sectors, the rare greenfields discovery would be accompanied with a rare share price jump for the ages??\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Source: SBS News Professor Nitika Garg, a researcher in consumer behaviour at UNSW in Sydney, has some answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's cultural and traditional, how we have attached value to gold, not in just in terms of the actual value of the asset, but in terms of emotional value where it's considered from everything from good luck to a symbolism of wishing the best to your close family and friends on occasion,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's also research that humans have over time evolved to sort of get attracted towards jewels and gold, which just because it gives them that assurance, it's an asset, it's a resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And just with water, food, these assets have over time evolved to hold meaning for us.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's behind gold's price rise?\n\nExperts say geopolitical factors, global unrest including fears of inflation fanned by the threat posed by US President Donald Trump's tariffs \u2014 just some of the reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Gold Council says central banks are also buying up gold at eye-watering rates, and investors tend to see it as a safe bet in difficult times.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Council says in 2024, jewellery accounted for about 50 per cent of total demand, central bank reserves around 20 per cent, electronics and Industrial around 7 per cent, medical and dental about 1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile demand for jewellery has dropped due to the price, it still retains strong cultural value in many parts of the world.\n\n\n\nTrading.Com's Australian CEO Peter McGuire says substantial populations of people buying gold in countries like Japan, Malaysia, and China has affected the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says when you consider the cultural value of gold in \"Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, and you've really captured again the best part of probably 2 billion people\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a big store of value, certainly in the likes of India.

And a kid is born, we buy gold Diwali at the Festival of Lights. We buy gold and we put that in for temple as well. For worshipping as well. Yeah, it's quite a product.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe store owner Akshaj Sharma estimates that about 90 per cent of its customers are from the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Nitika Garg says the skyrocketing price of gold is putting a lot of pressure on India's middle class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have family and friends in India, there is still the expectation if it's a marriage of your daughter or your son, you are expected to make jewellery for them or give jewellery to the other party,\" she says.\n\n\n\nAbout 90 per cent of Akshaj Sharma's customers are from the Indian subcontinent.

So stuff they've had passed down some, they've had it for years and they're either using their gold, so they're incorporating the gold into something new.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Gold Council says mine production accounts for the largest part of global gold supply \u2014 typically, 75 per cent each year with the shortfall made up from recycling.\n\n\n\nAmid the cost of living crisis, many are opting to sell heirloom gold jewellery.

But now it's getting popular again. And a lot of people want the thicker jewellery. Younger people. It's getting popular with a couple of the rappers. And they wear the thick jewellery with the thick pendants and that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe love of gold dates back a long way.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 5,000 BC the Egyptians used gold found in the bed of the Nile River for adornment, while it also featured heavily in ancient European, Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question, though, is why do humans in almost every part of the world love this shiny metal so much?\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Nitika Garg is a researcher in consumer behaviour at UNSW in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's funny, right?

We all understand that the depth of those countries from a population standpoint and gold has been a source of value or a source of family value for literally millennium. And that holding of gold has been one of dowries or placing under beds or weddings or festivals that you have throughout your year. Christening anything like that is very much a gift that someone would gift some form of gold to someone. Then you roll it across to the likes of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, and you've really captured again the best part of probably 2 billion people. It's a big store of value, certainly in the likes of India. It's very much a part of their culture, their heritage, and certainly their belief as far as a store of value.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a ritual for us to be honest on festivals and occasions. And a kid is born, we buy gold Diwali at the Festival of Lights. We buy gold and we put that in for temple as well. For worshipping as well. Yeah, it's quite a product.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHolding a baby about eight or nine months old with a mop of thick dark hair, Ajay and his partner are shopping for jewellery in Sydney's Harris Park.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's one of a couple of jewellery shops in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe owner of the shop estimates that about 90 per cent of its customers are from countries in South Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshaj Sharma runs Akshara Jewellery with his dad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Generally it's necklace sets and bangles, pretty heavy, heavy stuff. So the bride side will gift the groom. The groom side will gift the bride. They'll obviously gift the rings as well. They'll give some rings. Or for the bride it'll be necklace sets and bangles. And they're generally pretty heavy so that they last a very long time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris Park in Western Sydney is affectionately known as Little India; that's because around 45 per cent of its population was born in India, according to the 2021 Census.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suburb is lined with grocery shops, restaurants, clothing shops and jewellery shops.\n\n\n\n\n\n22 carat gold reigns supreme here - the preferred choice for many people from South Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes it a pricey gift in today's gold market - although that hasn't stopped Ashima, who has just bought her fiance a gift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In our culture If I give him something made of gold, I don't have to decide anything else. It's like a prestigious issue also. And it's like a property value also, like an investment. So he would not say, why did you spend that? Because he would love it. I got him a locket. It has the name of my state. Originally I come from Punjab, so it was a locket with the name of Punjab initialled it, and it's our mother tongue. It's written in Punjabi, not in the English language. So that's what I thought, that he would love it and he would also have an emotional connect with that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Nitika Garg says consumer behaviour and culture are often linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most of southeastern cultures in particular have high value on this, and if you look at their tradition, especially around marriage or birth of a child, there will be significant investment or exchange of gold, whether it's in terms of jewelry or bullion. And I obviously know about India from personal experience, but also I know friends from Vietnam, Thailand, everywhere, even China, it is a big deal in terms of personal and social exchanges.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she adds the skyrocketing price of gold is putting a lot of pressure on India's middle class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have obviously family and friends in India, there is still the expectation if it's a marriage of your daughter or your son, you are expected to make jewellery for them or give jewellery to the other party. So there is pressure, and it is obviously hurting the middle class more because they don't have quite the give, the very poor and the very rich options are either too many or rarely no options. But the middle class, at least in India, I can see they're hurting a little bit because it changes your dynamics, how much you could give with the same amount of money. And now gold is so expensive, it's like literally you can't touch it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshaj Sharma says there has been an increase in the number of people coming into the shop to sell rather than buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have jewellery from 10, 20 years ago, they still sell to us or from their grandparents and stuff that have passed away. And generally also their cost of living has gotten people to sell more as well. People can't afford to live, so they just start selling off all jewelry that they have from generations ago.

Gave some to my kids, got some stuff fixed around the house, spent some, ate some and it's gone. Yeah, it's pretty much gone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVince says in Turkish culture gold remains a important gift, particularly at weddings and births.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also considered a valuable asset - a backup plan in hard times.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt weddings guests are also expected give gold coins or jewellery as wedding gifts.\n\n\n\n\n\nVince says that can be too much for some people who may choose to avoid these celebrations all together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And people don't turn up to weddings because of that kind of pressure. So they get invited and they make an excuse because they're going through hardship and they make up some kind of excuse to not turn up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDanny Georgakopoulos is seeing an increase in people recycling old jewellery rather than purchasing something new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of buying a new piece outright, they're bringing in their heirloom jewellery. So stuff they've had passed down some, they've had it for years and they're either using their gold, so they're incorporating the gold into something new, which is nice because if you're sentimental jewellery, you're still using the same jewellery that has been passed down from a loved one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Gold Council says mine production accounts for the largest part of global gold supply \u2013 typically, 75 per cent each year with the shortfall made up from recycling.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthworks, a United States environment group, says there are more than 2,000 major mining companies in the world in addition to countless small artisanal mining sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group says these mines are a major source of pollution with few taking steps to avoid further environmental damage from gold mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious studies say gold recycling could meet the world's current gold needs with less need to resort to mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at Oxford University say about one-quarter of annual gold demand is already supplied through recycling and could be increased with strategies such as blending with other metals.\n\n\n\n",

Different kinds of things, like (learning how to make) suits, coats, T-shirts, pants, and (using) machine. Every (sewing) machine, I can use it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Ms Sultanzi made a suit for the Governor-General of Australia Sam Mostyn, who has also worn clothing from the brand during her swearing-in ceremony last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy Low is the chief executive of the brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough the partnership with TAFE New South Wales in the past decade, her brand has supported and upskilled over 450 migrant women interested in Australia's fashion industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we are able to deliver in that partnership with TAFE here is the women who may be comfortable sewing on a domestic machine, will have their first experience under supervision with the industrial sewing machine. And in gaining both technical skills, they are also really experiencing what it might be like to work as a machinist, and to begin a career in that industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story of Ms Sultanzi and The Social Outfit is one that the federal government wants to see more, as they announce more investments in the country's vocational education training sector - or VET sector - during its launch of the 2025 National Skills Week (25-31 August).\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year's theme was 'VET as a game changer'. This year, it is 'Exploring All the Options'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe emphasis on the different and varied opportunities for all Australians to access training and upskilling, regardless of their location.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the National Press Club, the Minister for Skills and Training Andrew Giles says since fee-free TAFE places became available in 2023, there has been over 650,000 enrollments across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Free TAFE is breaking down cost barriers and de-stigmatising the idea that learning is only for the young. More than 125,000 Australians aged 45 and over have enrolled.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Giles used his National Press Club speech to announce a $30 million investment in the VET trainer workforce, aiming at increasing the number of electrical and construction VET teachers, and First Nations VET teachers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also wants to see a sustainable skill training system, backed by both educational institutions and industries, to support the idea of lifelong learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a concept that knits together how we should be thinking about supporting people to navigate the changing world - on their terms. Moving beyond the narrow sense of equipping a person to perform a role. Because jobs are changing and we now know people can now expect to move between industries, not simply between employers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Wexham is th e chief executive and chair of National Skills Week.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says lifelong learning is key - and will be needed more than ever, as developments like AI's impact on work and workers drive demand for upskilling and reskilling.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wexham says he also hopes there will be major improvements in the perception of the value of the VET sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we need to do, and what the government need to do, we need to get those messages across, and the story across, of the success of people coming out of vocational education and what they've been able to do. I mean to go to TAFE isn't a failure. It's a success story.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wexham also says VET can be helpful for the settlement of refugees and migrants - and that's the exact story of Samia Salhaz.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter being a chef in Syria for 20 years, Ms Salhaz moved to Australia in 2022, and began a traineeship with the Bread and Butter Project, a social enterprise that offers baking training to refugee women, in partnership with TAFE New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter graduation, she secured a job with the enterprise to train other women.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese may not have expected a wholly positive reception at the Bush Summit in Ballarat, country Victoria, today, but it's unlikely he expected having his motorcade chased by tractors.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan may not have expected to find herself blocked from leaving the summit venue by both tractors and Country Fire Authority (CFA) fire trucks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootage posted by the Herald Sun newspaper shows the prime minister's white motorcade being followed closely by fast-moving tractors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted the prime minister and premier's office for comment but has not yet received a reply.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Labor leaders would be aware of the opposition to renewable energy infrastructure that's been simmering in rural areas around Ballarat for several years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey would also be aware of the hostility directed towards Victoria's emergency services levy, which some in regional communities believe unfairly burdens them with the cost of funding services such as the CFA.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtests against these issues have seen large convoys of fire engines and tractors take to the streets of Melbourne and smaller cities of Victoria in recent years.\n\n\n\nSeveral Country Fire Authority fire trucks were driven in to Melbourne to protest the state Labor government's emergency services levy on 20 May. Source: AAP / James Ross\n\n'This is these people's castles'\n\nIn the fertile potato-growing areas around Ballarat, the opposition to renewable energy infrastructure is primarily directed against the Western Renewables Link, an electricity transmission line that will run from wind farms in Victoria's west to Melbourne's outer suburbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt just 190 kilometres, the high-voltage power line makes up only a fraction of the approximately 10,000 kilometres of new transmission lines that Australia may need to build to decarbonise our electricity grid by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction on the project was originally slated to start in mid-2025 but has now been delayed until after the 2026 state election, something the state opposition has said is a deliberate ploy by Labor to hang on to its seats along the project's path.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransmission company Ausnet has attributed the delay to changes made to the project's route and design, which involved \"extensive updates including engineering design, planning and community consultation,\" a spokesperson said, as reported by The Weekly Times in April.\n\n\n\nLocal farmer Will Elsworth says the 'Piss Off Ausnet' hill \u2014 first created by another local farmer several years ago \u2014 is now \"the most recognised landmark in the Hepburn Shire\". Source: Supplied / Will Elsworth At the Bush Summit, a member of the public asked Albanese: \"Why are regional communities paying the cost for renewable energy? Where is the social licence? Where is the regulation to protect our communities, value our farmland and preserve our environment?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese, who was repeatedly booed by some regional landowners in the summit\u2019s audience, said: \"Quite clearly, governments haven't done well enough in the engagement and community consultation and those processes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese said he'd had conversations with locals about \"their experience of just getting hit with information from an energy company without any notice\", which he described as \"completely unacceptable\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAllan also said that engagement with landowners over such projects had \"not been acceptable\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether it's the support that landowners receive in hosting transmission lines on their property, whether it's the compensation arrangements that are being made available \u2026 we can work through these issues together,\" the Herald Sun reported the premier as saying.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian government has committed to pay landowners $8,000 a year for every kilometre of transmission infrastructure for 25 years.\n\n\n\nHowever, Will Elsworth, a farmer who attended Friday's protests, said increasing the rate of compensation wasn't a solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They've offered people millions of dollars and they will not let them in because these people have, I don't know if the word's right, an intrinsic value to their land,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like [1997 Australian movie] The Castle. There was no money with the bloke in The Castle. He didn't want to be bought out because his family's home is his castle, and this is these people's castles. Money's not the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She's trying to roll these renewables and transmission lines across the most productive farmland in Australia,\" Elsworth said, referring to Allan.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of the premier's delayed exit from the summit, Elsworth said: \"So she's decided to leave, and then they've actually blocked the road's exit with people, and then they've blocked it with tractors. Then they've blocked it with fire trucks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So you couldn't get out. It didn't matter if you moved the tractor, you couldn't move the firetruck.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nElsworth said he wasn't familiar with the moment in which the prime minister's motorcade was reportedly chased by tractors.\n\n\n\nDiscontent 'urgently needs to be addressed'\n\nThe Victorian government has recently passed legislation granting state government agency VicGrid powers to access private farmland to build transmission towers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe laws, which passed Victoria's upper house earlier this week, give authorised officers the power to use \"reasonable force\" to enter properties. Those who obstruct, hinder or delay access to such officers face fines of several thousand dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe news was met with fury by some farmers, who told the ABC they would continue to refuse access to those involved in transmission line projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictorian Farmers Federation president Brett Hosking said the laws would only \"create more discontent, distrust and disharmony in the community, and the opposition will last longer, be stronger, and the transition's going to take a whole lot longer\".\n\n\n\nHowever, there's evidence suggesting opposition to renewable energy infrastructure isn't necessarily a dominant sentiment outside of Australia's cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2024 poll commissioned by Farmers for Climate Action found that 70 per cent of respondents supported clean energy projects on farmland in their community, while only 17 were opposed.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling in the same year commissioned by the Renewable Energy Alliance (RE-Alliance) found over 60 per cent of those in regional areas support government investment in large scale renewable infrastructure in regional Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in a recent submission to government, Re-Alliance policy and engagement manager Tony Goodfellow argued that this support was fragile and \"growing discontent that urgently needs to be addressed\".\n\n\n\nEmergency services levy\n\nFriday's protests in Ballarat were also motivated by Victoria's Emergency Services and Volunteers Levy, a local tax hike to support the provision of various emergency services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe levy, which passed state parliament earlier this year and will come into effect next year, is projected to increase the amounts paid by property owners relative to the tax scheme it replaces.\n\n\n\n\n\nCouncils are tasked with collecting the new levy \u2014 a responsibility that some have not warmly embraced.\n\n\n\nHepburn Shire Council, which takes in areas around Ballarat, passed a motion earlier this year \"confirming Council's strong opposition to the Emergency Services and Volunteers Levy\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Council has previously written to the Treasurer and Minister for Local Government expressing that the levy has a disproportionate financial burden on rural and regional communities, like ours, especially primary producers,\" the council wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to criticism, the state government has offered a one-year temporary exemption to primary producers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Not one healthcare professional raised the possibility that Phillips may have had endometriosis. Had they guessed, Phillips wondered, would they have taken her pain more seriously?\n\nNo one had investigated the source of the pain or her intense nausea and, eventually, anaemia, Phillips said.\n\n\u201cI was really confused,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBut I had seen so many doctors that I just started to believe them.\u201d\n\nIt did not need to come to this. Over two years, Phillips had described pain that would \u201cliterally stop me in my tracks\u201d to more than 10 GPs, a gastroenterologist and staff at a hospital emergency department.\n\nThe aggressive growth was one thin layer of soft tissue away from causing a complete rupture and potentially life-threatening sepsis.\n\nIt was the size of a golf ball and threatening to rip through Olivia Phillips\u2019 bowel.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\n\u201cWe have women calling our helpline haemorrhaging in the bathroom, and they say, \u2018The GP has told me that this is normal\u2019,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cNormal? How is haemorrhaging in the bathroom normal?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are still, in 2025, hearing that women are not being believed about their symptoms,\u201d said Jess Taylor, chair of the Australian Coalition of Endometriosis and CEO of advocacy body QENDO.\n\n\u201cFor so long we\u2019ve seen this gaslighting that\u2019s described by patients, where they\u2019ve presented to a health care provider with a set of symptoms, and they\u2019ve been told it\u2019s in their head, or it\u2019s normal, when it\u2019s not,\u201d said Jason Abbott, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of NSW and chair of the National Endometriosis Clinical and Scientific Trials (NECST) network.\n\nOne woman\u2019s endometrial lesions had all but killed her kidney before her pain was properly investigated. Another said her symptoms were dismissed as normal, despite period pain so severe that she had fainted and knocked her front teeth out. Others were prescribed anxiety medication and diagnosed with depression with no investigation into the physical cause of their distress.\n\nAmong them were dozens who described being turned away from emergency departments, delays in diagnosis spanning years \u2013 or decades \u2013 that robbed them of the chance to have children, and having their pain dismissed as a normal part of womanhood.\n\nEndometriosis was the single most common disease among more than 2000 accounts of medical misogyny shared by Australian women with this masthead: more than 200 women with the progressive, chronic disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other parts of the body.\n\n\u201cIt was the only way for my body to remove waste,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing I was eating was staying down.\u201d\n\nBy 2020, two years after Phillips first sought help, she couldn\u2019t sleep for the pain. The 27-year-old could no longer pass bowel movements. She was vomiting so frequently that she was rapidly losing weight.\n\nLost in translation are the research breakthroughs that take years to be adopted in practice, and doctors\u2019 well-meaning but poorly delivered advice that leaves patients feeling dismissed.\n\nHealthcare professionals are reliant on endometriosis research that is 30 years behind conditions such as breast cancer, despite the condition affecting an estimated one in seven Australian women before the age of 50. It takes an average 6.5 years for women to be diagnosed after first experiencing symptoms.\n\nThe women, clinicians, researchers and advocates who spoke out for this investigation largely blame the systemic gender bias of a healthcare system rooted in medical research that has for centuries skewed male.\n\n\u201cI cried,\u201d said Phillips, now a mother of two \u2013 Noah, 3, and Goldie, 10 months. \u201cIt was a relief that finally I knew what it was and I could fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear how profoundly your symptoms impacted your quality of life,\u201d Nikam later wrote to Phillips, \u201cfrom years of debilitating pain and multiple dismissive consultations to the extreme measures you had to resort to just to manage [your] symptoms.\u201d\n\nNikam, with a specialised team, performed emergency surgery to remove the large lesion and seven centimetres of Phillips\u2019 bowel.\n\nPhillips had extensive, deep-infiltrating endometriosis: the most advanced presentation of the condition.\n\nA colleague, seeing her in this state, convinced her to push for a referral for a colonoscopy. It revealed a large pelvic mass compressing her bowel.\n\n\u201cBut we have to be very careful that this doesn\u2019t turn women away from all doctors. We should be encouraging women to seek out health care, and if they do, unfortunately, encounter misogyny, then try somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there is medical misogyny,\u201d said Professor Danielle Mazza, chair of general practice at Monash University and a member of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.\n\nBut the challenge, researchers and advocates say, will be how effectively these advancements can gain traction at the coalface, where healthcare workers and patients are up against decades of entrenched dogma.\n\nIn the past year alone, Sydney hosted the World Congress of Endometriosis, UNSW announced a world-first endometriosis research institute , the federal government funded an expansion of specialised clinics and subsidised treatments , and endometriosis ultrasounds, and new clinical guidelines are expected to speed up delays in diagnosis.\n\nSignificant strides have been made in the past decade towards filling the knowledge gaps for this chronically under-researched and underfunded disease, due to the dogged advocacy of patients, researchers and clinicians.\n\nDiagnosis: Normal\n\nThat endometriosis is a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for women\u2019s reproductive organs \u2013 is one of the most harmful, pervasive myths of the condition, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cEndometriosis is a multi-system, complex, chronic condition,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to crack open that conversation \u2026 so women are taken seriously when they say, \u2018What about my bowel, my bladder, I\u2019m disabled because of this condition\u2019.\u201d\n\nDr Jane Chalmers, senior lecturer in pain sciences at the University of South Australia, said the default has been to assume endometriosis pain is \u201cjust part of women\u2019s experience\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is such a common story \u2026 People are still dismissed. They have their pain normalised,\u201d said Chalmers, who also leads the pelvic pain component of the Innovation, Implementation and Clinical Translation in Health (IIMPACT) initiative at UniSA.\n\nFor women with endometriosis, fame and near-endless monetary resources have proven to be no defence against being dismissed by healthcare professionals.\n\nAustralian conservationist and television personality Bindi Irwin had a decade-long battle to get a diagnosis. She said one doctor told her the pain \u201cwas simply something you deal with as a woman\u201d.\n\n\u201cI felt lesser. I felt hurt. I felt weak. That is not OK,\u201d Irwin, 27, wrote on social media this month. \u201cYoung girls and women shouldn\u2019t feel alone with pain in the driver\u2019s seat of their lives.\u201d\n\nAbbott said this confluence of \u201cnormal\u201d menstrual pain with abnormal, severe and life-impairing pain is at the heart of the issue.\n\n\u201cAs a man, if I had cyclic chest pain and I went to the emergency department, you can bet your bottom dollar that I would be investigated in a heartbeat,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only am I a man [who is] presenting with the pain, but I actually don\u2019t have a system in my body that, as part of its normal process, produces pain.\n\n\u201cIf patients are coming, and they\u2019re relaying to us symptoms that are not being improved with current management, then you need to acknowledge and respond to that, rather than relegating it to \u2018that\u2019s a normal process\u2019, \u2018you just need to get over it\u2019.\u201d\n\nJess Taylor said one of the most harmful myths about endometriosis was that it was just a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d.\n\nTaylor described the case of a woman with endometriosis who presented to an emergency department in February with a ruptured ovary.\n\n\u201cThey told her to just go home, take ibuprofen and paracetamol. \u2018You have got pelvic pain, it should go away\u2019,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nIt\u2019s a common story among endo patients when over-the-counter painkillers don\u2019t touch the sides of their symptoms, Monica Forlano, board chair of Endometriosis Australia, said.\n\n\u201cWomen will pass out from the pain \u2013 they\u2019ll go to emergency and request stronger meds and be treated like drug seekers,\u201d Forlano said.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to the myth that pain is women\u2019s lot in life, and that\u2019s what makes them the weaker, fairer sex.\u201d\n\nLoading\n\nChalmers said the consistent theme of the report from a landmark South Australian parliamentary inquiry into endometriosis was the emphasis on improving practitioner training.\n\n\u201cPeople recognise that health practitioners are the gatekeepers. They\u2019re the ones that someone presents to, and they are then either dismissed and normalised or they are sent on the path to recovery,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018If I can be gaslit, anyone can\u2019\n\nLindsay Tuggle\u2019s endometriosis went undetected for more than a decade of unexplained pain, five failed IVF cycles and a succession of healthcare professionals who didn\u2019t take her seriously, before she finally found a specialist who correctly diagnosed her endometriosis.\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t believing me,\u201d the literary scholar and author said. \u201cIt was a dark period where I just thought, you know, I was going a bit crazy.\u201d\n\nLindsay Tuggle\u2019s pain from an endometriosis lesion was written off as the effects of her desk job.

She was 43 years old.\n\nThe excruciating pain when she sat down was caused by lesions that had wrapped around the sacral nerves at the base of her spine. Her doctors assumed this was due to her long hours working at her desk, Tuggle recalled.\n\n\u201c[They would say]: \u2018This is about the fact that you sit for work, you\u2019re a writer\u2019. When, in fact, I\u2019m very fit. I\u2019m very active. I have a sit-to-stand desk,\u201d she said.\n\nTuggle was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at 29 years old after initially being told by a doctor that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t possibly have PCOS because you\u2019re not fat\u201d.\n\nShe was also diagnosed at 36 with adenomyosis (in which endometrial tissue grows in the muscular wall of the uterus). Both conditions are known to present with endometriosis.\n\n\u201cNo one ever talked to me about endometriosis,\u201d Tuggle said.\n\nShe abandoned her hopes of having children, something she believes was stolen from her by a healthcare system that failed to consider endometriosis as the cause of her unexplained pain and IVF failures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m medically literate,\u201d Tuggle said. \u201cIf I can be medically gaslit, it can happen to anyone.\u201d\n\n\u2018Absolute absence of information\u2019\n\nWhen Professor Caroline Ford, lead researcher of Gynaecological Cancer Research Group at UNSW, began searching endometriosis literature four years ago, she found \u201can absolute absence of information\u201d.\n\n\u201c[If] we don\u2019t understand the basic biology of half the population and what the hell is going on, then how on earth can we possibly provide good care for people and good advice?\u201d Ford said.\n\nAn infamous 2013 study published in one of the world\u2019s most influential fertility medical journals judged the attractiveness of women with endometriosis without the consent of participants.\n\nThis peer-reviewed and Milan University-funded paper concluded women with rectovaginal endometriosis \u201cwere judged to be more attractive\u201d, leaner, larger-breasted and were younger when they first had sex compared to women in control groups.\n\nThe journal retracted the paper seven years later, after sustained criticism, at the request of the authors.\n\n\u201cWhen we say \u2018medical misogyny\u2019, it\u2019s a misogyny in funding and research,\u201d said Dr Nisha Khot, president-elect of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG).\n\n\u201cDoctors can only do what they can do within the system they work in. We are relying on things that lack evidence behind them.\u201d\n\nThe $50 million Ainsworth Endometriosis Research Institute (AERI), announced by UNSW in May and led by Ford and Abbott, is a key pillar in Australia\u2019s world-leading efforts to fund and pioneer endometriosis research.\n\nChalmers said there was a \u201chuge delay\u201d \u2013 at least 15 years \u2013 for research findings to translate to changes in clinical practice.\n\n\u201cIf [a practitioner] is not someone who is upskilling in that area, they will continue doing that same sort of normalisation and dismissal until they know better,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, unproven, unfounded medical myths have filled the void.\n\n\u201c[Women are] being thrown all of these ideas completely not grounded in evidence because these individual health professionals don\u2019t have the education, and women are making significant life choices based on that,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWomen are not being afforded informed consent about their health, about their life choices.\u201d\n\nEndometriosis researchers and clinicians said among the most damaging and prevalent misconceptions are the reliance on a narrow list of symptoms that conceal the true extent and variation in presentations of the condition. Equally, the belief that symptoms are a cyclical and inevitable part of being a woman, which will spontaneously resolve in time.\n\nOther diehard myths are that teenagers don\u2019t get endometriosis, laparoscopy is the one-size-fits-all treatment, and that pregnancy is curative.\n\n\u201cPrescribing pregnancy as a treatment for endometriosis is completely untenable,\u201d said Abbott, who is also the clinical director of AERI.\n\nRebecca Ballesteros, 35, was advised by a doctor that having a baby would relieve her symptoms. Credit: Wolter Peeters\n\nBut that\u2019s just what Rebecca Ballesteros said her gynaecologist did.\n\nThe 35-year-old has never wanted children. But when she sought help for her heavy bleeding and period pain, the specialist said she probably had endometriosis, but it wasn\u2019t worth undergoing surgery and she should \u201chave a baby instead. Most of the time it helps,\u201d Ballesteros recalled.\n\n\u201cI was shocked and upset at the suggestion that I should have and raise a child to maybe help with chronic pain,\u201d she said.\n\nA 2023 Australian study based on a survey of 3347 people diagnosed with endometriosis found almost two-thirds had been advised to get pregnant or have a baby to treat their condition, the vast majority (89.4 per cent) by a healthcare professional.\n\nLesley (left) and Sylvia Freedman are founders of EndoActive. Credit: Sam Mooy\n\nSylvia Freedman, co-founder of EndoActive with her mother, Lesley, and a study co-author, said this advice was often given to patients when they saw their doctors for pain management.\n\n\u201cIt should have absolutely nothing to do with having a child,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unethical and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, endometriosis can cause infertility. It\u2019s estimated 30 to 50 per cent of women with the condition struggle to get pregnant.\n\nAbbott said pregnancy may temporarily reduce endometriosis symptoms because it paused a woman\u2019s menstrual cycles, \u201cwhich the pill can also do\u201d, combined with high progesterone levels and other \u201chappy chemicals\u201d produced by the body as it prepares for childbirth.\n\n\u201cBut as soon as that all stops, symptoms return,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got the endometriosis pain, and the baby, which is a lifelong commitment, certainly not just a prescription.\u201d\n\nMazza said it\u2019s probably the case that some doctors are not fully explaining why pregnancy may alter the course of the disease.\n\n\u201cI think the problem is in the delivery,\u201d Mazza said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re necessarily advising women to rush out and get pregnant, but it\u2019s helping the woman to understand that things that suppress or stop you from menstruating will likely improve endometriosis symptoms, and one of those things is pregnancy.\u201d\n\nFor Abbott: \u201cthe best period is no period\u201d.\n\n\u2018We will cut you open, we will cut it out\u2019\n\nFor some women such as Ballesteros, who spent a year on a public hospital laparoscopy waitlist, surgery can be life-changing.\n\nBut Dr Pav Nanayakkara, a gynaecological surgeon at Melbourne\u2019s Jean Hailes for Women\u2019s Health, said endometriosis could often be linked to numerous conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, meaning treatment may need to be multipronged. She had encountered patients who had laparoscopies, but had been \u201cjust left\u201d when the procedure didn\u2019t fix their pain.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that makes me sad is when patients say they underwent a procedure that they didn\u2019t feel comfortable with, or they didn\u2019t understand what happened to them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLosing trust in the health profession is a really sad thing because then diagnosis can be delayed [and] problems can become more severe.\u201d\n\nChalmers said the overreliance on surgery \u2013 with its associated risks and long, often arduous recovery times \u2013 was a clear example of medical misogyny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2018we will cut you open, we will cut it out, and you will get better.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAbbott said too many women are given no other option.\n\nJason Abbott is a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of NSW. Credit: Sam Mooy\n\n\u201cI certainly see patients who respond to surgery, and then the disease comes back, and it doesn\u2019t respond to medication, and all we can do is more surgery,\u201d he said.\n\nSurgery is \u201cthe law of diminishing returns\u201d, Abbott said. \u201cOne surgery, we know, can be efficacious. Two surgeries, certainly. But I hear stories and I see patients where they say, \u2018I\u2019ve had 30 surgeries and I\u2019m 30 [years old]\u2019. That is way too many. They are quite clearly not responding to surgery.\u201d\n\nIn a major step towards more timely diagnosis and treatment, a new guideline published by RANZCOG in May overturned reliance on surgery to diagnose endometriosis (formerly the gold standard), recommending transvaginal ultrasound as first-line investigation for patients with symptoms.\n\nThe guideline also advised clinicians to offer women first-line treatment (in the form of hormones such as the contraceptive pill and intrauterine devices) while they waited for a diagnosis, as well as painkillers, physiotherapy and psychological support.\n\n\u201cIt makes the whole pathway simpler and more accessible,\u201d said Mazza, who was the RACGP representative on the guideline\u2019s development group, and is working on a management plan to help GPs structure consultations with patients that reflect the guidelines.\n\nBut a complicating factor, Mazza said, was that many women can feel dismissed by doctors who offer hormonal treatments amid a global movement of women moving away from using hormones.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because the GP isn\u2019t explaining why hormonal treatments are being recommended \u2026 but I think there needs to be increased awareness in the community that hormone therapies can be very beneficial for a range of conditions,\u201d Mazza said.\n\nDanielle Mazza supports encouraging women to seek out health care.\n\nOne reason for this shift is the growing evidence of an association with the side effects of hormonal contraception, most commonly low mood.\n\nIf women aren\u2019t responding to hormone treatments or are experiencing side effects, Abbott said simply giving them more is not the answer.\n\nDr Bridget Dickenson, a general practitioner at Jean Hailes for Women\u2019s Health, said she would commonly see women who had been on the contraceptive pill for up to a decade, who, when they come off the pill (perhaps to have a baby) have a resurgence of terrible pain and bleeding.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cThey may get diagnosed with endometriosis, and they have the perception that the pill masked their symptoms and delayed their diagnosis, when the pill was just doing a great job of treating the symptoms,\u201d Dickenson said. \u201cThis is always a bit of a conundrum.\n\n\u201cI always have a conversation when starting these treatments, that in five to 10 years, it may be that you are diagnosed with something like endometriosis. But that just means this treatment has been working for you.\u201d\n\nIf pain and bleeding can be well controlled by hormonal treatments such as the pill, with no side effects and no symptoms of deep-infiltrating endometriosis, it can reduce the number of surgeries (and complications such as adhesions) a woman has over her lifetime, Dickenson explained.\n\nThe key is regular follow-ups to ensure the woman is happy with the treatment, she said.\n\nFundamentally, Mazza said, doctors are products of their society.\n\n\u201cWhere society doesn\u2019t value women, where women are seen as just reproductive bodies and not given respect, that doubtless filters through into consultations with patients,\u201d Mazza said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of levels where misogyny comes into play.\n\n\u201cDoes the system work against women? We don\u2019t have the full range of contraceptive options available on the PBS, ultrasound scans are rebated less than scrotal ultrasounds, hospitals may not have enough gynaecological services when half the population may need them.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mazza said: \u201cThere are fantastic doctors who do great work, and thank goodness for that.\u201d\n\nMEDICAL MISOGYNY: A CALL FOR ACTION The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald last year launched an investigation into medical misogyny: ingrained, systemic sexism across Australia\u2019s healthcare system, medical research and practice. More than 2000 women shared their experiences as part of our crowd-sourced investigative series, which prompted a national outpouring of grief and frustration as women described feeling gaslit, dismissed or being told their pain was \u201call in their heads\u201d. We call on the federal government to boost Medicare funding for GP appointments that last more than 20 minutes to improve care for women and others with complex health conditions. The Albanese government and the Coalition have promised to pour $8.5 billion into Medicare to make GP visits more affordable and improve bulk billing rates, but longer 20-minute appointments will receive a smaller proportional funding increase. Doctors have warned that these policies could further disadvantage women by continuing to incentivise shorter consultations, which don\u2019t give GPs enough time to address menopause, pelvic pain and other women\u2019s health issues.\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

    "text": "As soon as Chloe Molloy ruptured her ACL in September last year, she turned to Swans coach Scott Gowans and said: \u201cI\u2019ll be back stronger and better than ever.\u201d\n\nAnd the player Gowans describes as the Dustin Martin of the women\u2019s competition proved it.\n\nOn Saturday she equalled the record for most goals in an AFLW game with seven, and that was off the back of a starring role in round one.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best female footballer I\u2019ve ever seen, but until you see what she does to prepare for, and recover from, the game, and how she reviews vision\u2026 studies upcoming [opponents] and tactics, you probably don\u2019t understand [that] you\u2019re never going to fail, as such.\u201d\n\nGowans spoke of the look in Molloy\u2019s eyes during their first conversation after her injury last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether she saw doubt in me, or whether she thought I might not believe her\u2026 [but] she had a look in her eye,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThe first run [she had since the injury], she said, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to have a kick\u2019.\n\n\u201cHer first kick was horrible \u2013 it was all over the shop.\u201d\n\nThat was at \u201cabout the five or six-month mark\u201d, Gowans estimates.\n\n\u201cShe followed exactly what the rehab plan was to the letter, which is hard to do as an athlete,\u201d Gowans explained further.\n\n\u201cIt was the extra stuff. She just wouldn\u2019t accept that she can\u2019t do more kilometres\u2026 or get back quicker.\n\n\u201cIt was all about what she could do that didn\u2019t break the rules of rehab \u2013 the touches, the vision and the things like that, the extra ice baths, the extra massages.\n\n\u201cShe just ticked so many boxes and she didn\u2019t miss a beat and came back in pre-season and broke her PB in the time trial, she\u2019s benching and deadlifting record weights for her, she completely changed the way she eats\u2026 you just never doubted her [through her comeback process].\u201d\n\nMolloy even picked the brain of Australian Football Hall of Fame member Erin Phillips about her own injury comebacks.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019ll break the [goals in a single game] record,\u201d Gowans said of his star.\n\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re playing a clutch game or a grand final, she\u2019s the type of person who would thrive on it.\n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t have any doubt at all \u2013 she\u2019s made for the big moments.\n\n\u201c[Her teammates] can see that she leads the way by example, and they just follow her.\n\n\u201cShe brings them into the game as well.\n\n\u201c[And] we put her on the ball in the centre bounce last weekend and she got a couple of clearances, but it was more the velocity and the power\u2026 she breaks lines.\u201d\n\nNow Molloy is dominating to the point that her coach urges anyone with even a fleeting interest in footy to come along and see her in action.\n\n\u201cYou actually go to the game of football just to watch her, regardless of whether you\u2019re a male or female football lover,\u201d Gowans said. \u201cShe drags people through the gates, and people are better for going to see Chloe Molloy play.\u201d",

    "text": "Bulls N\u2019 Bears\u2019 Runner of the Week is African oil and gas hopeful Invictus Energy, which has stirred from its slumber this week with hopes of unlocking its flagship Cabora Bassa project in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe company could be something of a leviathan, having inked a blockbuster deal with Qatar\u2019s Sheikh Mansour for a maxed out 19.9 per cent equity stake for a measly $37.8 million at 9.5c per share. The investment is accompanied by a pivotal US$500 million in conditional future funding to push Invictus\u2019 mammoth Mukuyu gas discovery toward commercial production.\n\nInvictus says it and Al Mansour Holdings will also form Al Mansour Oil & Gas (AMOG), a joint venture to acquire producing and near-term oil and gas assets across Africa, with Invictus handling technical and operational management and Al Mansour providing funding, what a combo.\n\nA representative from Al Mansour will join the Invictus board to cement the partnership, as the long-dormant Cabora Bassa project in Zimbabwe\u2019s Muzarabani Basin looks destined to finally flow gas to the African market.\n\nCabora holds an insane, estimated 20 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas and condensate potential \u2013 that\u2019s trillion with a \u2018T\u2019 - making it one of Africa\u2019s largest undeveloped gas fields.\n\nShares, accordingly surged 145 per cent on Wednesday\u2019s announcement, followed by another rocketing leap of 42.31 per cent on Thursday, to a 12-month high of 18.5c, with $30 million in stock traded.\n\nThat combined uptick added nearly $36 million in paper value to Al Mansour\u2019s holdings - not bad for a couple of days work.\n\nIf AMOG\u2019s M&A spree delivers and Mukuyu flows, Invictus could transform from a rusted-on Zimbabwean junior to a pan-African titan.\n\nBASIN ENERGY LIMITED (ASX: BSN)\n\nUp 220% (2.5c - 8c)\n\nSnagging silver is Canadian-based uranium explorer Basin Energy, after the explorer scooped up private critical minerals company in NeoDys, securing a prime position in northwest Queensland\u2019s Mount Isa region.\n\nNeoDys\u2019 extensive ground lies southwest of the world-renowned Mt Isa, next to Paladin Energy\u2019s Valhalla hard rock uranium deposit \u2013 a hefty 116-million-pound uranium deposit - and Red Metals\u2019 giant Sybella clay rare earths deposit.\n\nThe deal offers three exploration models for Basin in the humming uranium and rare earth critical minerals. From paleochannel uranium to hard-rock rare earths and clay hosted rare earths, the deal comes with a helpful $150,000 Queensland government grant to fund exploration.\n\nThe deal was accompanied by a $1.25 million placement to fund drilling later this year.\n\nAs rare earths and uranium roar back to life, so did Basin\u2019s share price, which rocketed 220 per cent to a high of 8c on $2.5 million in stock traded on Wednesday.\n\nThe company, which listed in late 2022, has its sights set on developing it uranium portfolio housed within the world-class Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada.\n\nHome to giants like Cameco\u2019s McArthur River, Basin\u2019s North Millennium, Geikie and Marshall projects were promised to chase shallow, high-grade uranium, with sniffs of radioactivity uncovered in 2023 before the uranium price cratered last year.\n\nWith Athabasca\u2019s uranium pedigree and Queensland\u2019s dual-play potential, Basin\u2019s low-cost aircore drilling could prove potent. While uranium mining is still currently banned in Queensland, the project\u2019s rare earths prospects could quickly turn out massive resources like Red Metal\u2019s multi-billion tonne clay rare earths deposit next door. The upside on this new style of mineralisation remains unknown but should the economics prove positive at Red Metal, the district will be set alight in an area dominated by both Red Metal and now Basin.\n\nARK MINES LIMITED (ASX: AHK)\n\nUp 192% (18.5c \u2013 54c)\n\nTaking bronze is Ark Mines Limited, another junior explorer targeting \u2013 you guessed it - rare earths and even heavy mineral sands to supply the West\u2019s clean energy transition technologies.\n\nThe company received a massive boost to its potential this week in the form of a $4.5 million handout from the Queensland Investment Corp (QIC) Critical Minerals and Battery Technology Fund for its Sandy Mitchell project 230 kilometres northwest of Cairns.\n\nThe funding consists of a $4 million royalty-tied capital injection and a $500,000 equity investment at 16.7c - following extensive due diligence by the QIC, which manages a whopping $131.2 billion portfolio.\n\nArk says the cash will fast-track a stage-3 infill drilling program and a prefeasibility study at Sandy, targeting production by late 2027.\n\nSandy Mitchell hosts a measured resource of 71.8 million tonnes at 1732 parts per million (ppm) monazite equivalent, with an exploration target of 1.3\u20131.5 billion tonnes at 1286\u20131903 ppm.\n\nThe project\u2019s monazite-rich sands contain key magnet REEs including neodymium and praseodymium, both vital for EV motors and wind turbines. Its shallow, open-pit-friendly deposit and Queensland\u2019s infrastructure also support low-cost mining.\n\nA scoping study estimates a $120\u2013150 million development cost, with annual EBITDA of $45\u201353 million and approximately 80 local jobs. Shares soared 192 per cent to a three-year high of 54c on $870k in stock traded.\n\nAnd while monazite-rich sands contain key magnet REEs like neodymium and praseodymium, vital for EV motors and wind turbines, and Ark\u2019s shallow, open-pit-friendly deposit and Queensland\u2019s infrastructure support low-cost mining, scaling a billion-tonne dream in remote terrain is no walk in the park.\n\nAligned with Australia\u2019s push for supply chain security amid global REE shortages, Sandy Mitchell\u2019s massive exploration target could make it a globally significant hub, but environmental and logistical hurdles in Cape York\u2019s rugged landscape remain.\n\nTechGen Metals Limited has identified two parallel high-grade copper gossans and iron quartz gold zones at its Blue Devil project, 40km northeast of Halls Creek in Western Australia.\n\nTECHGEN METALS LIMITED (ASX: TG1)\n\nUp 165% (2c \u2013 5.3c)\n\nRounding out this week\u2019s Runners is copper-gold hopeful TechGen Metals, which was shot out of a cannon this week after it identified two parallel high-grade copper gossans and iron quartz gold zones, just 80m apart, at its Blue Devil project, 40km northeast of Halls Creek in the Halls Creek Orogen.\n\nRock chip samples along a 2km east-west corridor returned grades up to 52.3 per cent copper, 22.6 per cent copper and 5.35 grams per tonne (g/t) gold.\n\nThe Blue Devil project has never been drill-tested, giving TechGen a rare greenfield opportunity to deliver a potentially significant copper-gold discovery, with key targets stretching nearly 3km.\n\nThe company says a critically important heritage survey with the Jaru People is now complete, with tenure granting imminent and an IP survey planned to refine its 2.75km intrusion-related target in the winds.\n\nAs gold prices soared so did TechGens market cap, flying up a staggering 165 per cent to a high of 5.3c on $4.5 million in stock traded.\n\nThe mineralised hotspot is known for structural complexity and rich deposits. Notable projects include IGO\u2019s Halls Creek copper-zinc revival.\n\nShould Blue Devil\u2019s high-grade surface results and undrilled status position it as a major greenfields discovery in the surging red and yellow metal sectors, the rare greenfields discovery would be accompanied with a rare share price jump for the ages??\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

But if they lose again, Australia are set to leave the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup with nothing.\n\nAustralia will play Ilona Maher\u2019s US side after losing to them at the 2024 Olympics. Credit: Getty/Ben Watts\n\nLast year, Australia was 15 seconds from a podium finish at the 2024 Olympics in Paris. The bronze medal they were on track to win would have been a mere consolation prize for a team that could have won gold, forced upon them by a Canadian upset in the semi-final.\n\nInside those 15 seconds, USA\u2019s Alex Sedrick scored and converted her own try to steal the bronze and hand the medal to Maher, whose online profile has surged from the social media content she made during the Olympics.",
