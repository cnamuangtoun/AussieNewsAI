    "text": "T\ufeffhe chairman of the US Federal Reserve says he will \"stand firm in the face of threats\" amid a fresh eruption in his feud with US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Department of Justice has threatened Jerome Powell with a \"criminal indictment\" over his comments at a Senate Banking Committee meeting in June\ufeff last year, where the cost of rebuilding two federal government-owned buildings was discussed.\n\nIt comes \ufeffafter months of growing tensions between the Fed and Trump, which became public when he and Powell clashed on live television .\n\nTrump and Powell clashed on live TV after touring the US Federal Reserve's renovations in June last year. (AP)\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the equivalent of the Reserve Bank of Australia and sets the official cash rate in the US.\ufeff\n\nSince returning to office at the start of last year, Trump has repeatedly called for Powell to be fired and replaced with someone more willing to drastically cut the US cash rate.\ufeff\n\nIn an extremely rare statement issued late on Sunday night (Monday AEST), Powell\ufeff said he had \"deep respect for the rule of law and for our accountability in our democracy\", but this threat of an indictment was not about a blowout in construction costs.\n\nPowell's time at the helm of the Federal Reserve is drawing to a close. (AP)\n\n\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,\" he said.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\ufeff\"\n\nThe Fed in the second half of last year lowered rates three times in row, though officials have recently said they were unlikely to lower rates again for a while.\n\nTrump's pressure campaign has included a barrage of personal insults at Powell and an ongoing effort to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook , appointed by then-president Joe Biden.\n\nThe federal probe comes as Trump prepares to announce his pick for who will replace Powell once his term ends in May. The decision will cap a months-long search process for arguably the most influential role in the global economy.",

    "text": "US President Donald Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document US history.\n\nThe wall text, which summarised Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \"American Presidents\" exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Trump taken during his first term.\n\nNow, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though the text was available online. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen Sunday, did not include any extended text.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's new portrait in the Smithsonian. (AP)\n\nThe White House did not say whether it sought any changes.\n\nNor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions.\n\nBut Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4.\n\nhe Republican administration said the effort would \"ensure alignment with the president's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\"\n\nTrump's original \"portrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThat section concludes: \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\"\n\nThe exhibit has had text referring to Trump's impeachments removed. (AP)\n\nThen the text continues: \"After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\"\n\nAsked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Trump's \"unmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery\".\n\nThe portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Trump is the 45th and 47th president.\n\nSimilar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries such as what had been part of Trump's display.\n\nThe Smithsonian in Washington, DC. (Getty)\n\nSitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.\n\nIngle did not answer questions about whether Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.\n\nThe gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.\n\n\"The museum is beginning its planned update of the America's Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\" the gallery statement said.\n\n\"For some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist's name.\"\n\nOne of Trump's impeachments was over the US Capitol riot. (AP)\n\nFor now, references to Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton being impeached in 1868 and 1998, respectively, remain as part of their portrait labels, as does President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation as a result of the Watergate scandal.\n\nAnd, the gallery statement noted, \"The history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\"\n\nTrump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents US history and culture.\n\nHe has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.\n\nTrump replaced Joe Biden's portrait in the White House with the picture of an autopen. (Margo Martin/X via CNN Newsource)\n\nIn the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.\n\nAt the White House, Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2013 with the exception of Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2013 along with plaques describing their presidencies.\n\nThe White House said at the time that Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques.\n\nNotably, Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \"by far, the worst President in American History\" who \"brought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\"",

    "text": "Marta Kostyuk's run to the Brisbane International final was groundbreaking for many reasons.\n\nThe 23-year-old had a relatively disappointing 2025, only making three quarterfinal appearances across the season.\n\nKostyuk recorded consecutive victories over top-10-ranked opponents, beating number two seed Amanda Anisimova, number six seed Mirra Andreeva, and fourth seed Jessica Pegula to make her first WTA final appearance in 21 months.\n\nBut against world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the final, she came unstuck, losing in straight sets.\n\nPlaying Sabalenka has always been a challenge for Kostyuk.\n\nAryna Sabalenka claimed a second-straight Brisbane International trophy. (Getty Images: Bradley Kanaris)\n\nThe pair have met five times now, with the Belarusian winning on all five occasions.\n\nThere are also tensions between the pair off-court.\n\nSabalenka soars to second-successive Brisbane title Aryna Sabalenka has claimed her second-straight Brisbane International title, beating Marta Kostyuk 6-4, 6-3.\n\nBelarus has been an active supporter of Russia's aggression in Ukraine, prompting Kostyuk to take a stance of refusing to shake the hand of any Russian or Belarusian player she faced.\n\nBefore the final, organisers confirmed there would be no joint photograph of the players before or after the match to avoid any doubt.\n\nOn court, following the defeat, the world number 20 pointedly refused to acknowledge Sabalenka in any way, using her post-match on-court interview to instead highlight the plight of her fellow Ukranians in the midst of a tough winter.\n\n\"I want to say a few words about Ukraine,\" Kostyuk said.\n\n\"I play every day with a pain in my heart. There are thousands of people who are without light and warm water right now, it's minus-20 degrees outside right now, so it's very, very painful to live this reality every day.\n\n\"I was incredibly moved and happy to see so many Ukrainian fans and flags here this week \u2026 slava Ukraini.\"\n\nMarta Kostyuk has not beaten Aryna Sabalenka in five attempts. (Getty Images: Albert Perez)\n\nIn the post-match press conference, she elaborated further, saying it was her duty to talk about Ukraine.\n\n\"I think it's important for me to use my platform in the right way, and my platform is Ukraine, because I represent Ukraine, so I think it's really important to talk about that,\" she said.\n\n\"I think, I have such exposure, so many people follow me, so many people look up to me \u2026 I have just learned with the war and everything that's going on that it's really important to stand up for things and to talk about them, whether it's war, whether it's other beliefs, or the position that you have, no matter what it is, if it's what you believe in, you have to talk about it.\n\n\"I'm here, I do my job, of course, this is the most important thing, but at the same time, the reality back home is very, very different.\n\n\"So I just, I feel like I cannot ignore it, and I have to share it. I have platform for this, and I have voice.\n\n\"In my position, it's not OK to not talk about it. It's just, I mean, it's just gonna be inhumane for me.\"\n\nMarta Kostyuk said the reality for people in Ukraine is very difficult for her. (Getty Images: Albert Perez)\n\nSabalenka has spoken out against the war in the past.\n\n\"No-one in this world, Russian or Belarusian athletes, supports the war. Nobody,\" Sabalenka said in 2023 at the French Open, when Kostyuk was booed for not shaking Sabalenka's hand.\n\n\"If we could stop it, we would, but, unfortunately, it's not in our hands.\"\n\nIn Brisbane on Sunday, Sabalenka praised Kostyuk on court, before saying the stance of Ukraine's players on shaking her hand was their decision.\n\n\"It's their position. What can I do? I don't mind that. I don't care about that,\" Sabalenka said.\n\n\"When I go into the match, it's all about tennis and sport.\n\n\"When I go out there, I think about my tennis and the things I have to do to get the win. Doesn't matter if it's Marta Kostyuk or Jessica Pegula there. I still go out there, and I still try my best, and I'll still fight for the trophy.\n\n\"I have nothing to prove. I go there and I just compete as an athlete.\"\n\nThere was more off-court beef relating to the pair apart from geopolitical issues, too.\n\nLate last year, Kostyuk was quoted as saying players like Sabalenka and world number two Iga \u015awi\u0105tek had an advantage because they had more testosterone than other players.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAs Sabalenka sealed the victory, she pointedly kissed both biceps while looking at her opponent, although she later said the gesture was an in-joke between members of her team.\n\nKostyuk said she had been misquoted and that the situation was \"sad\" when asked about it in Brisbane.\n\nBut she did not apologise.\n\n\"If I had said something wrong, I never have a problem to apologise, or to reach out to someone or whatever,\" Kostyuk said after her semifinal victory.\n\n\"But this was not the case at all \u2026 I knew what I said, so I was okay.\"",

    "text": "The US attorney's office in the District of Columbia has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June,\" Mr Powell said in a statement.\n\nThe testimony concerned, in part, a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.\n\n\"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" he said.\n\n\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings.\n\n\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No-one \u2014 certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is above the law.\"\n\nTrump fact-checked by Federal Reserve boss in exchange over renovations The US Federal Reserve chair pushes back on President Trump's criticism of renovation costs amid a campaign of growing pressure.\n\nThe inquiry, which was approved in November by the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, includes an analysis of Mr Powell's public statements and an examination of spending records, The New York Times reported.\n\nMr Powell, whose Australian counterpart is Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock, says the legal threat is directly related to the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy settings.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" he said.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"\n\nAn unprecedented move\n\nThe legal threat amounts to a dramatic escalation in the fight between Mr Powell and US President Donald Trump, which dates to Mr Powell's first year as chair in 2018.\n\nWestpac's chief economist and former RBA official, Luci Ellis, said it was an unprecedented move by the US government.\n\n\"It's shocking but not surprising and certainly unheard of in a major developed economy,\" she said.\n\nThe legal threat amounts to a dramatic escalation in the fight between Jerome Powell and Donald Trump.\n\nMs Ellis said it would make many Americans think twice about public service.\n\n\"[It] casts a pall on the attractiveness of US government service for Americans,\" she said.\n\nIndependent economist Saul Eslake said the action was what people had come to expect from the Trump administration.\n\n\"This reminds of a Peruvian dictator in the 1930s who famously said, 'for my friends, everything, for my enemies, the law',\" he said.\n\nABC News asked Mr Eslake if he thought the legal threat to Powell could affect the Reserve Bank's monetary policy.\n\n\"Indirectly, yes,\" he responded.\n\n\" It's another threat to the credibility of the US Federal Reserve. \"\n\nHowever, Mr Eslake said it was more likely to affect longer-term Australian interest rates.\n\nShorter-duration interest rates, such as the cash rate, influence what mortgage borrowers pay their lenders.\n\nLong-term interest rates affect government borrowings.\n\n\"Longer-term Australian interest rates will continue to rise,\" Mr Eslake said.\n\n\"This will affect the cost of borrowing for the Australian government.\"\n\nThe Reserve Bank has been contacted for comment.\n\nLoading\n\nABC/Reuters",

    "text": "Australian aerial skier Danielle Scott has broken through for her first World Cup triumph in nearly three years in a timely boost to her medal hopes at next month's Winter Olympics.\n\nThe 35-year-old three-time Olympian has had a particularly lean run this season but put her woes behind her with a morale-boosting triumph at Lake Placid in the United States less than a month before the start of the Games in Italy.\n\nScott scored 95.88 points in the super final to take top spot ahead of China's reigning Olympic champion Xu Mengtai, who scored 94.01.\n\nAmerica's 2025 world champion, Kaila Kuhn, was third with 92.29.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nLaura Peel, who won the last World Cup event in Canada, was unable to stick her landing and finished sixth, while fellow Australian Airleigh Frigo was seventh.\n\n\"I'm just letting this sink in. I've had a rough run this season,\" said Scott, with the victory her first in a World Cup event since March 2023 and the seventh of her career.\n\n\"A lot of highs and lows \u2026 today I just needed to go prove myself, and I did that, so I'm stoked.\"\n\nDanielle Scott won her first World Cup event since March 2023. (Getty Images: Al Bello)\n\nWith four out of six skiers in the medal round attempting triples, Scott's choice of a back double full-full proved a smart decision after assessing the tricky conditions of the day.\n\n\"I was hoping to do triples, and we made some hard decisions and decided to keep it on the double. I think it paid off,\" she said.\n\n\"I want to do them, so let's get Mother Nature on our side.\"\n\nIn the men's competition, China's Wang Xindi opted to go with five twists.\n\nDespite the conditions, he was rewarded with a win.\n\nWith landings proving to be challenging for many athletes, his back double full-full-double full earned a 103.50 and his first World Cup win of the season.\n\nCompetitors will line up for another World Cup at Lake Placid on Monday (local time) to wrap up their preparation for the Milan-Cortina Games, which start on February 6.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(Supplied: Kent Lyon)\n\nIn May 2024, Southern Ports told a community committee the cottages had \"been reviewed by Kent Lyon, who will provide a report on the stabilisation of the buildings\".\n\nIn August 2024, the same committee was told \"a local heritage architect is working on steps on how to stabilise the buildings\".\n\nWhen the ABC asked Southern Ports for a copy of this report last year, a spokesperson said it would take some time to source.\n\nAfter a Freedom of Information application by the ABC, a copy was released.\n\n'Urgent' work required\n\nCompleted in April 2023, the report recommends a range of measures, several requiring urgent attention and the remainder requiring attention within 12 months.\n\nUrgent work included removal of plastic sheeting placed over the eastern wall of one cottage, which Mr Lyon said had \"exacerbated the deterioration [of the weatherboards] with a humid 'glasshouse' effect\".\n\nA photo from Kent Lyon's 2023 report shows damage to one of the cottage's bases. (Supplied: Kent Lyon)\n\nSouthern Ports said it had installed the black plastic \"with good intent; to preserve and weather protect the interior of the building\".\n\nAlmost three years later, this plastic sheeting remains in place.\n\nThe port authority said the conservation works should occur as a package, and the removal of the plastic sheeting was contingent on cladding being installed.\n\nOne of the Leschenault Homestead cottages on January 3, 2026. (ABC South West WA: Jacqueline Lynch)\n\nOther issues highlighted included dampness in brick fireplace and chimney walls, and the need to disperse rainwater away from buildings, with \"considerable conservation and reconstruction work\" required.\n\n\"The cottages have deteriorated extensively over the past two decades and remain unoccupied,\" the architect noted.\n\n\" Urgent work is required to fully weather seal the cottages \u2026 doing as little as possible is not feasible. \"\n\nMr Lyon noted several times in the report that previous reviews as far back as 2008 had produced similar recommendations.\n\nSouthern Ports stands by restoration timeline\n\nSouthern Ports told the ABC \"temporary stabilisation works\" on the cottages had been undertaken.\n\nBut the more substantial work recommended in the report had \"not been achievable in the 18-month time frame recommended\".\n\nFormer occupants, the Johnstons, pose for a portrait at the Leschenault Homestead in 1902. (ABC South West WA: Ezra Kaye)\n\n\"These works are extensive and take time to plan, scope and complete in a considered manner that also reflects broader port planning and heritage requirements,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"Southern Ports is committed to undertaking the next phase of these works, which is scheduled to commence later this year.\"\n\nThe port authority said it had inherited the homestead \"in a state of disrepair\" and had restored the main building, now being used as an office.\n\nStrict heritage requirements\n\nAs the owner of a heritage-listed site, Southern Ports is required to comply with obligations under the Heritage Act.\n\nThe Heritage Council can issue a repair notice compelling it to undertake certain works and, if they are not completed by the specified date, advise the relevant minister to make a repair order.\n\nA Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage (DPLH) spokesperson said Southern Ports had flagged its intention to pursue the required work this year.\n\nA painting of one of the original cottages of the Leschenault Homestead, which is now falling into disrepair.

You get new managers, you get new people on board, and sometimes the priorities slip down the list.\"\n\nMr Kelly, also a former Bunbury city councillor, called for more transparency around conservation efforts.\n\n\"What needs to be provided quite openly is how much progress the port authority has made over the last two years,\" he said.\n\n\"Preservation of heritage buildings and history is an ongoing process that passes on from generation to generation.\n\n\"At the moment, it's on the port authority's watch. They are responsible for ensuring that the Leschenault Homestead is looked after, and they must step up and do that.\"",

You get to see me, though.\n\n\"You'll go see mummy soon. Give me a cuddle. I love you, sweetie.\"\n\nHe gave a hug and a kiss to his slightly more relaxed eight-year-old son, saying: \"How good's this? This'll be you one day.\"\n\nOnce the game started, Carey also may have been seeking some comfort in the stands as he watched from behind the stumps while Perth openers Marsh (88 off 51) and Finn Allen (38 off 16) peeled off 81 runs inside five overs.\n\nLeg spinner Lloyd Pope removed Allen and Cooper Connolly in successive deliveries, but the rest of the Scorchers were almost unstoppable.\n\nCaptain Marsh clattered six fours and seven sixes in his powerful knock, with Josh Inglis (42 off 23), Aaron Hardie (34* off 22) and Ashton Turner (20* off 8) keeping the run rate high as the Scorchers notched 4-232 off 20 overs.\n\nAdelaide threatened to pull off a remarkable victory on reaching 2-139 after 12 overs thanks to Carey's half-century as part of a 93-run opening stand with captain Matt Short (52 off 31).\n\nBut a superb second over from debutant spinner Luke Holt, who conceded just four runs in the 13th over of the innings, helped turn the tide.\n\nAn increasingly desperate Adelaide lost 6-14 as the wheels fell off, and finished on 8-200.\n\nCarey's was the second wicket in that collapse, with the wicketkeeper well caught by a diving Turner off Mahli Beardman in the 16th over.\n\nTurner made a point to hold up the ball above the ground after Renegades post controversial win over Scorchers\n\nAshton Turner made a point of showing how fair his catch of Carey was after his controversy days earlier against the Renegades.

    "text": "The national bulk-billing landscape is changing fast, according to a new survey that shows the percentage of fully bulk-billing medical clinics has almost doubled in a year.\n\nCleanbill, an online GP directory, has released its January Blue Report, which was informed by 6,900 GP clinics across the country and shows 40.2 per cent of available practices now fully bulk-bill standard weekday consultations for all adult patients.\n\nThat figure was about 21 per cent at the same time in 2025.\n\nA total of 1,007 clinics nationwide have switched from private or mixed billing to bulk-billing only since the start of last year, the report showed.\n\nNew South Wales and the Northern Territory, where the share of bulk-billing clinics has more than doubled, have the largest increases.\n\nHowever, the ACT remained an outlier, with only about one in 10 clinics fully bulk-billing.\n\nAnd the report showed the average out-of-pocket cost is creeping up nationally, with patients now paying about $49.30 if they are not bulk-billed.\n\n'Really encouraging' report\n\nCaroline Johnson, a GP and associate professor of General Practice and Primary Care at the University of Melbourne, said the increase to bulk-billing across the country would be \"very pleasing\" to the federal government.\n\nCaroline Johnson says more needs to be done to make medical care equitable. (Supplied: Peter Casamento)\n\n\"It suggests that the rates of bulk-billing are starting to change as a result of some of the interventions the government have made in 2025,\" Dr Johnson said.\n\n\" General practice is the quintessential population-level health intervention and you have to believe everybody should have access to affordable care, so on that front this is really encouraging. \"\n\nBut Dr Johnson said affordability was only part of the challenge.\n\n\"Affordability is just one of the five dimensions of access, and if we only focus on cost we risk overlooking whether people are getting care that is acceptable, appropriate and delivered at the right time,\" she said.\n\nDr Johnson said the surge in fully bulk-billing clinics across the country was an encouraging early sign but it was \"too early\" to call it a success.\n\n\"The real test will be whether people \u2026 feel their care has actually improved, not just become cheaper on paper,\" she said.\n\nFederal Minister for Health and Ageing Mark Butler said the data in the Cleanbill report \"should not be relied upon\".\n\n\"On clinic numbers, they failed, for example, to include clinics that did not answer their questions,\" he said.\n\n\"Since November 1, more than 3,200 practices are now fully bulk-billing. Almost 1,200 of these were previously mixed-billing practices.\n\n\"Close to 7,500 general practices are now registered with MyMedicare. This has increased significantly since 1 November 2025.\"\n\nRoyal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) president Michael Wright said bulk-billing levels remained high and that most GPs were \"continuing to bulk-bill the majority of consultations\".\n\nHowever, Dr Wright said Medicare rebates were not keeping up with the true cost of care and that RACGP data indicated the average length of appointments was rising, along with consultation complexity.\n\n\"We need to make sure that all Australians have affordable access to GP services, particularly those people with complex health conditions who need more time with their GP,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why we're calling for a boost to Medicare funding for the long consults these patients need.\"\n\nCanberra paying more\n\nThe report showed only 11.1 per cent of ACT clinics were fully bulk-billing, while the average standard consultation fee had climbed to about $100.33, the highest in the country.\n\nMany Canberra patients told the ABC the numbers on paper matched what they were experiencing.\n\nJayde Parker and her children (Savannah and Wiliam) struggle to access medical care. (Supplied: Jayde Parker)\n\nNDIS support coordinator and practitioner Jayde Parker, from Gordon, about 30 kilometres south of Canberra's centre, said the majority of her patients had to choose between \"food or the doctor\".\n\n\"They might have to travel 35 or 40 minutes across town [to access a bulk-billing clinic] and they often don't have a car, they don't have the money for a taxi and public transport doesn't get them to the door,\" she said.\n\nShe said she paid the price personally in 2023 when she delayed care for pneumonia because she could not afford the doctor.\n\nMs Parker said she had to wait four days to access a bulk-billing doctor, who sent her straight to hospital.\n\nJayde Parker was hospitalised after delays accessing a bulk billing doctor. (Supplied: Jayde Parker)\n\n'How do they manage?'\n\nRetired public servant Robyn Shaw, 71, has lived in Canberra since the 1970s and said she remembered when GP visits were almost always bulk-billed.\n\nThese days, she said, she paid about $109 for a standard appointment in Casey, getting about $40 back from Medicare.\n\nRobyn Shaw remembers when most clinics in Canberra were bulk-billed.

(Getty Images: Brendon Thorne)\n\nIn a worrying development just a week out from the Australian Open, the world number two left the court for treatment after suffering a rare bagel in her deflating loss to Bencic.\n\n\u015awi\u0105tek was in state of complete despair by the end, tossing her racquet across the court and bursting into tears following her second straight defeat at the event.\n\nWorld number one Aryna Sabalenka underlined her Open favouritism with a third successive Brisbane International crown on Sunday, but second-ranked \u015awi\u0105tek's defeat against the Swiss marked her second of the week after a straight-sets loss to world number four Coco Gauff on Saturday night.\n\nThe six-time grand slam winner was also seen crying at the first changeover during her victory over Australian Maya Joint on Friday night.\n\nEcstatic with Poland's victory, \u015awi\u0105tek played down any issues.\n\n\"Everything is fine.

(Supplied)\n\n\"We were able to gather literally everything we needed; new tents, blow-up mattresses, water and so much unopened food,\" Ms Stubbings said.\n\n\" It was really surreal. It felt like we were shopping because there was so much left behind. \"\n\nEntire campsites were left behind at New Year's Eve festivals. (Supplied: Beth Green)\n\nWhen the 20-year-old shared her experience on social media, the consensus among commenters was that the volume of trash was nothing unusual.\n\n\"I was so shocked to see how many people left their belongings, but it was even more shocking that it was normal for everyone online,\" she said.\n\n\"Everyone is really tired after a multi-day festival, but I didn't think people were that lazy or careless.\"\n\nPotential solutions\n\nGreen Music Australia chief executive Berish Bilander said that, despite being a long-standing and contentious issue, more work was needed to regulate campsites at music festivals.\n\nBerish Bilander says festival-goers need to keep each other accountable when it comes to waste. (Supplied)\n\n\"More than half of the waste that comes out of these events is from the campsites,\" he said.\n\n\"Thousands of pieces of very cheap camping gear come through the gates only to end up in the trash a day later.\n\n\"An initiative we've seen really work is the pre-made tent villages, so patrons don't have to bring their own camping gear.\"\n\nCampsites are responsible for more than half the rubbish accumulated at music festivals. (Supplied: Beth Green)\n\nMr Bilander said the biggest hurdle was creating a cultural shift among festival-goers.\n\n\"It's all about the ethics of the people at the event; if everyone is holding each other accountable, they'll leave the place cleaner than they found it,\" he said.\n\n\"We've seen that work when a festival has that energy, and there's a real commitment to either borrow or not bring low-cost camping gear.\"\n\n'Cultural shift' needed\n\nResearch by Green Music Australia has found one in three tents taken to a music festival is left behind.\n\nStatistics show that one in three tents entering a music festival will be left behind. (Supplied: Beth Green)\n\nThat statistic rings true for Joshua Davies from B-Alternative, who operated at this year's Lost Paradise event on the NSW Central Coast.\n\n\"It really is a growing culture of consumerism, buying something extremely cheap knowing you'll only use it once,\" he said.\n\n\"But it's nothing new \u2014 we've seen it for decades, but cheap products are easier than ever to obtain.\"\n\nJoshua Davies has been dropping off the forgotten festival camping gear to local rough sleepers and charities. (ABC Central Coast: Shauna Foley)\n\nSocial enterprise B-Alternative hosted a repair facility at Lost Paradise, where patrons could have problems with tents and other camping equipment fixed onsite.\n\nMr Davies said the space helped start conversations with festival-goers about their responsibility to \"leave no trace\".\n\nDozens of discarded tents and other camping gear were donated to local rough sleepers. (Supplied: Joshua Davies)\n\n\"It's a chain reaction,\" he said.\n\n\" If we can influence one person, they'll take that mindfulness with them and carry it on. \"\n\nAfter the event, Mr Davies and his team used several removalist trucks to deliver abandoned camping gear to charities, op shops and rough sleepers in the area.\n\n\"Until we see that cultural shift, we'll continue to see all this mountain of perfectly usable camping equipment go into landfill,\" he said.\n\n\"We were fortunate to have the right stakeholders in place this time to salvage what was left behind, though that's not always the case.\n\n\"But [festival organisers] need to be frank with patrons and show them the aftermath of their fun.\"",

    "text": "Prior to Brie's three-year-old son starting kindergarten, he had never been in the care of anyone other than his parents.\n\n\"Any new environment, or environment without us, obviously impacted him greatly,\" says the 44-year-old from Geelong/Djilang, who asked we keep her real name private.\n\nKnowing her son's temperament and needs, she worked with the kindergarten on how best to transition him.\n\n\"We met with the kindergarten initially and asked if we could stay for as long as we wanted.\n\n\"They did say 'yes, that's definitely an option', and that they have kids in this situation [who might struggle with adjusting] all the time.\"\n\nThe transition, as Brie and her husband had expected, was hard to begin with.\n\nThe pair took turns staying at the service with their son, sometimes up to five hours each day. They did that for six weeks.\n\nHow the childcare abuse crisis is rewriting parenthood The childcare abuse crisis has left some families questioning if their kids are safe in daycare. Will primary carers, mostly women, be the collateral damage?\n\nIt's natural to feel nervous about transitioning your baby or child into early childhood education, explains Nesha Hutchinson, vice president at the Australia Childcare Alliance.\n\n\"It's a really normal response and this is why childcare centres have their own processes they know work for their particular community.\"\n\nKnowing some settling techniques, as well as what you can advocate for on behalf of your child, can help their transition.\n\nGet to know the centre\n\nIt's important to spend as much time at the centre as possible in the lead up to starting there, says Ms Hutchinson, such as attending orientations.\n\nIf you feel your child needs more time to adjust, you can request more orientations or \"stay and plays\" than what is offered, she says.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nMs Hutchinson recommends attending the centre at different times too, so you can get to know all the educators employed there. Some may only be there at drop-off times, but not pick-ups, for example.\n\nAsk questions about the routines, such as where children will be sleeping, at what times of day, and where they will eat lunch.\n\n\"Get to know that routine \u2026 and talk about it positively with your child,\" Ms Hutchinson says.\n\nWith babies, she says you may be able to stay in the centre to put them to sleep and be there when they wake up. Then transition to putting them to sleep, but allowing an educator to wake them while you are in the room. And next time be present while an educator does both.\n\n\"All those sorts of things can be really helpful,\" Ms Hutchinson says.\n\nChildren will follow your lead\n\nSheila Degotardi is a professor and director of the Macquarie University Early Childhood Education Research Centre.\n\nShe says families spending time at the service helps prepare the child for days without a caregiver or parents present, rather than \"leaving them without warning\", which can raise their anxiety and distress.\n\nIt also means the child can see you establishing relationships with educators, enabling them to build trust.\n\nEvery child care or kindergarten will have processes when it comes to settling a child in. (Pexels)\n\nProfessor Degotardi says children, even babies, are \"very perceptive\" and will identify how the family and educators are relating and interacting.\n\n\"Take that time to be in the room with your child, so the child starts to see, 'OK, well my parents are chatting away to the educators, that seems to be OK, so maybe those educators are OK.'\n\n\"Relationships don't happen by chance, they happen over time with repeated, positive interactions.\"\n\nIf you can't spend much time in the centre, Professor Degotardi suggests tag teaming with a partner or other trusted family members.\n\nShe says parents and caregivers can take cues from educators on when it might be a good time to leave, even if that's for short periods of time to begin with.\n\nThat goodbye process can be difficult for parents and children.\n\nProfessor Degotardi says you know your child and their needs best. While some parents may decide a short goodbye process is best, others may choose to stay longer.\n\n\"If the child is really clinging on to their parent, and if the crying persists, that may indicate that the child is struggling,\" Professor Degotardi says.\n\n\"It's OK to say 'Well I don't need to leave right now, let's get on the floor and play together' and an educator can join in, to build that trust.\"\n\nMs Hutchinson recommends parents and caregivers work towards short and consistent drop-off routines, adding parents who leave while their child is upset can request a call from the centre for an update.\n\nShe says children often settle within five minutes of a parent leaving.\n\nTransitional objects and rituals\n\nTaking comfort toys, also known as transitional objects, to the service can help infants and young children feel calm, says Ms Hutchinson.\n\nIt might be a T-shirt mum puts under her arm in bed each night that absorbs familiar smells for the baby \u2014 \"especially if she is breastfeeding\" \u2014 or a favourite teddy or a family photo, she says.\n\n\"Photos from home can be really reassuring, many centres often have a family wall so kids feeling anxious can look at a photo.\"\n\nThere are different ways to think of transition objects, says Professor Degotardi, who used a \"ritual\" instead. She would give her son's hand a kiss through the fence as she was exiting the centre, leaving a lipstick mark.\n\n\"It helped him feel secure.\"\n\nThis dad's experience with separation anxiety On the eve of his son's first day at childcare, Dave Couri was in tears.\n\nSettling in can take time\n\nBrie hoped being present in the kindergarten with her son for long periods would help him feel safer to build connections with educators and children.\n\nWhile she says she didn't always feel her presence was supported by the centre, or that the educators were motivated to try alternative strategies, things eventually improved for her son.\n\n\"Our transition was more gentle and set him up for success.\n\n\"When we did leave, there was tears, but at least we knew he was familiar with the space, with the educators, he had made connections with the children, so he could seek comfort, whether that was an activity, a toy, a friend, or somebody.\n\n\"It was all about his temperament, and nurturing that, and not expecting him to change, but changing his environment to allow him to feel confident and comfortable.\"\n\nMs Hutchinson says open and honest communication with the educators and centre director is key.\n\nIf a child isn't settling well, \"it can take time to work out what is going on,\" she says.\n\n\"Talk to the educators, spend time there being positive. Kids read whether you are happy or not, and act accordingly.\"",

Its high polyphenol content \u2013 an antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation and improve cholesterol, among other benefits \u2013 is proving to be a lucrative attribute for EVOO producers. This was acknowledged by Cobram Estate when announcing its Californian expansion. Chairman Rob McGavin told the Australian Financial Review \u2033\u2063every day there are articles on extra virgin olive oil and its benefits\u201d. Richard Seymour, general manager of Mount Zero Olives Credit: Mount Zero Olives Health conscious consumers come from all walks of life. \u201cFor older consumers it may be seen as improving heart health and moderation, while for younger ones it ties in with natural eating, wellness and authenticity,\u201d ANZ\u2019s insights found. Karam said the publicity of olive oil as a health food has meant it\u2019s \u201cno longer a niche ingredient. It is part of daily cooking, supported by health trends, and the appeal of the Mediterranean diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat shift is driving interest in provenance, freshness and trusted brands \u2013 areas where Australian producers excel,\u201d Karam said. Adding to the appeal is that Australia\u2019s counter-season harvests come to market just as northern hemisphere stocks run low.

Credit: Rivareno Gelato Mount Zero Olives, which draws produce from Victoria\u2019s Wimmera and Grampians, has been \u201cflooded by inquiries\u201d, said general manager Richard Seymour. \u201cWhen the European supply really suffered, we noticed this almost insatiable demand to inquire about Australian olive oil,\u201d said Seymour, whose premium olive oil business has largely moved to sourcing and pressing the fruits after his family sold properties where it previously farmed groves. \u201cSuddenly we were going from hatted restaurants, our bread and butter for years, to pubs and all kinds of eateries we thought we\u2019d never supply,\u201d he said.\n\nBusiness is so strong, Mount Zero now has to reject some inquiries from restaurants to ensure they meet demand for long-time customers. However, Seymour cautions that while revenue might be up due to price rises, cost-conscious chefs and consumers might look to buy less in volume terms and move to alternatives if prices climb further. Seymour also notes the relatively small yield from each olive when making EVOO means margins are tight. \u201cIf you\u2019re making grape juice, 90 per cent of the juice out of a grape is marketable, but with olives, it\u2019s somewhere between 10-20 per cent,\u201d he said. To make a standard 500ml bottle of EVOO can require as much as 5 kilograms of olives. Enea La Mantia, of Sydney\u2019s Bottega 1900 and Olive Oil Hub, tasting extra virgin olive oil Early harvesting of the fruit leads to a smaller yield but more complex taste, while the producers of lower quality, flatter tasting products might wait for groves to mature to get higher yields from each press.\n\nMassaria, who imports largely from Italy and sells them with listings of their polyphenol content, said that awareness and interest in specialty EVOO has taken off in Australia in the past few years. As a qualified sommelier and wine director in Sydney\u2019s restaurant scene, she is hoping to bring the same level of integrity to olive oil.

Credit: Bottega 1900 Since launching in 2020, Bottega 1900 also organises olive oil tasting evenings, similar to wine-style events. Initially it was chefs and specialised customers most involved with tastings, but Massaria said this has expanded. \u201cReactions [at tastings] are often revelatory for people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey show that premium extra virgin olive oil isn\u2019t limited to the kitchen bench\u2026many Australians are only just beginning to discover its true potential.\u201d Massaria \u2013 who spoke from Italy, where she is visiting producers ahead of new season European harvests arriving in Australia for sale from February \u2013 has previously collaborated with gelato chain Rivaereno in pairing different olive oils to drizzle over frozen scoops. One of its fine-dining restaurant customers also added EVOO-topped gelato to its menu.",

    "text": "More medical clinics are fully bulk billing than a year ago, according to a new report, but patients are also facing higher out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCleanbill on Monday released the results of a national survey, which contacted 6,877 clinics across the country and found the proportion of fully bulk-billing clinics had almost doubled in a year, from 20.7 per cent to 40.2 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey, conducted between 1 November and mid-December 2025 and disputed by the federal government, also found that out-of-pocket costs have grown for patients who aren't bulk billed.\n\n\n\nWhat do the numbers show?\n\nCleanbill reports over 1,000 clinics switched from private/mixed billing to fully bulk billing in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut visiting one of the almost 60 per cent of clinics that aren't fully bulk-billing has become more expensive. The average out-of-pocket cost for a standard consultation has grown from $43.38 to $49.23 in a year, according to the report.\n\n\n\nThe report defines the bulk billing rate as the number of clinics that will bulk bill a new adult patient without concessions who attends a standard consultation during regular hours, divided by the total number of available clinics in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nCleanbill collects this data by contacting clinics and inquiring whether they offer bulk billing to such patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler said \"specific data\" in the report \"cannot be relied upon\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On clinic numbers, they failed, for example, to include clinics that did not answer their questions,\" he said in a statement to SBS News on Monday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe percentage of fully bulk billing clinics has almost doubled to over 40 per cent nationally, with this rate surpassing 50 per cent in NSW and the Northern Territory, according to the Cleanbill report. Source: SBS News Cleanbill's report said clinics that did not respond or refused to share pricing or availability details were recorded in its database but left out of its analysis where costs could not be verified.\n\n\n\nWhere are Australians spending the most on GPs?\n\nAustralia's smallest and least populous jurisdictions are the most expensive for an adult patient without concessions, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nTasmania has the highest average out-of-pocket cost for a standard consultation at $60.76 in 2026, followed by the ACT and Northern Territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia all sit narrowly above or below the nationwide average out-of-pocket cost of $49.23, while Western Australia was the cheapest area at $46.63.\n\n\n\nTasmania has the highest average out-of-pocket cost for a standard consultation at $60.76, followed by the ACT and Northern Territory. Source: SBS News Meanwhile, the number of bulk-billing clinics rose by 19.5 per cent across the country, the report found.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment figures show that since 1 November, more than 3,200 practices are now fully bulk-billed. Almost 1,200 of these were previously mixed billing practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Close to 7,500 General Practices are now registered with MyMedicare. This has increased significantly since 1 November 2025,\" Butler said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By 2030, the number of fully bulk-billed practices will be boosted to around 4,800 nationally.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) said the availability of bulk billing indicated by both the Cleanbill report and federal government data was \"good news\", but added it was not surprising out-of-pocket costs were on the rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Medicare data show that most GP visits continue to be delivered without cost. However, the RACGP\u2019s Health of the Nation report highlights that consultation complexity and average length are both rising,\" said RACGP president Dr Michael Wright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the same time, Medicare rebates haven't kept pace with the cost of care for many patients. So, it is not surprising to see that out-of-pocket costs are increasing where new incentives don't cover the cost of providing high-quality care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWright said improved access to GP services in rural areas was positive but warned affordability remained a barrier for patients needing longer consultations, particularly for complex or mental health conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Medicare funding for extended appointments needed to be improved to ensure patients were not disadvantaged.\n\n\n\nWhat is the bulk billing scheme?\n\nThe government has expanded the bulk billing scheme to all Australians and is offering a 12.5 per cent incentive payment on Medicare rebates for clinics that bulk-bill all eligible patients, split between the GP and the practice, to boost accessibility and encourage fully bulk-billed services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has said the policies will triple the number of fully bulk-billed practices to around 4,800 nationally by 2030 .\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Where Labor plans to build 50 new bulk billing urgent care clinics\n\nIt means the Medicare payment for a standard GP consultation at a bulk-billed, city practice will be almost two-thirds higher \u2014 from $42.85 to $69.56.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a regional or rural practice, it will be almost doubled, from $42.85 to up to $84.86, depending on location.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of the policy announcement last year, Australian Medical Association president Danielle McMullen said there would be a shift in the rates of no out-of-pocket consultations in parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some areas would see no difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do hope this will make a difference in rural and regional communities and in our areas of socio-economic disadvantage, where GPs have been really trying as hard as they can to keep those costs down,\" McMullen said at the time.\n\n\n\n",

I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela.\"\n\n\n\nCuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel rejected Trump's threat on social media, suggesting the US had no moral authority to force a deal on Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Nobody dictates what we do,\" he said on X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cuba does not attack; it has been attacked by the US for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump did not elaborate on his suggested deal.\n\n\n\nBut Trump's push on Cuba represents the latest escalation in his move to bring regional powers in line with the US and underscores the seriousness of the administration's ambition to dominate the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's top officials, including secretary of state Marco Rubio, have made no secret of their expectation that the recent US intervention in Venezuela could push Cuba over the edge.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks, though the two countries have been at odds since former leader Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution.\n\n\n\nCuba defends import rights\n\nCuban foreign minister Bruno Rodriguez said in another post on X on that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to export it. He also denied Cuba had received financial or other \"material\" compensation in return for security services provided to any country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the US raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for \"security and defence\" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies.\n\n\n\n\n\nCuba relies on imported crude and fuel, mainly from Venezuela and, in smaller volumes, from Mexico, bought on the open market to keep its power generators and vehicles running.\n\n\n\nAs Venezuela's refining capacity has dwindled in recent years, its supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider, with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship-tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50 per cent of Cuba's oil deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's hard for many Cubans to imagine a situation much worse. The island's government has been struggling to keep the lights on. A majority live without electricity for much of the day, and even the capital Havana has seen its economy crippled by hours-long rolling blackouts.\n\n\n\n\n\nShortages of food, fuel and medicine have put Cubans on edge and have prompted a record-breaking exodus, primarily to the US, in the past five years.\n\n\n\nMexico becomes key supplier\n\nMexico has emerged in recent weeks as a critical alternative oil supplier to the island, but the supply remains small, according to the shipping data.\n\n\n\n\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said last week her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had become an \"important supplier\" of crude to Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is \"ready to fall\", Reuters news agency reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.\n\n\n\n",

What experts are seeing, however, is that it easily transmits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It appears that it's probably going to have an ability to at least be slightly less sensitive to antibody or vaccine-mediated protection,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeakin University epidemiology professor Catherine Bennett told SBS News: \"This new subvariant of the H3N2 is that bit more immune evasive with these latest mutations in the part of the virus that allows it to invade our cells, making us more susceptible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBennett said the 2025 flu vaccine included H3N2, but not this specific class.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Influenza cases surge: time to get vaccinated say experts SBS News 06:40 English\n\n\"Flu vaccines wane in effectiveness, so people vaccinated back in April-May and only getting infected now won't have the same benefit,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the 2026 flu vaccine for the southern hemisphere has already been updated to include this variant, and will likely be available around April, Bennett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEsterman said the flu vaccine remains worthwhile and provides important protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It still significantly reduces the risk of severe disease.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does a typical flu season look like in Australia?\n\n\"When we get seasonal influenza every year in Australia, or anywhere, it's a combination of three viruses,\" said Reading.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two influenza A viruses \u2014 a H3N2 and H1N1 \u2014 and one influenza B virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Centre for Disease Control, there were 365,261 reports of the flu in 2024. Cases spiked between May and August, and drastically dropped following the winter.\n\n\n\n\"As we move into spring, flu generally comes down in Australia, and then it's very low during summer,\" said Reading.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year there were 502,493 reports of influenza, with cases clearly continuing until the end of the year following those winter months.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to GISAID, H3N2 subclade-K is driving an estimated 90 per cent of cases in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we saw around September [in Australia] onwards is the H1N1s and B viruses decreased, but we saw an increase in H3N2 viruses,\" Reading said.\n\n\n\nHow can I avoid catching the flu?\n\n\"People who are unwell should consider testing and should avoid mixing with other people as much as possible,\" Bennett said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Is it COVID or the flu?

Got it Share\n\nDateline Resources has snagged another set of impressive, wide, and open gold intercepts from beyond the currently defined resource boundary at its Colosseum gold and rare earths project in California. The company says results from six diamond and ten reverse circulation (RC) holes drilled around the South and North pits have improved the continuity of mineralisation beneath the North pits and, in several instances, returned results outside the current mineral resource envelope. Drilling at Dateline Resources\u2019 Colosseum gold project in California. Standout intercepts were led by a massive 295.64-metre hit grading 1.04 grams per tonne gold (g/t) from surface. That was backed up with a second solid 105.15-metre strike going 0.66g/t gold from surface. A third hit measured a mammoth 300.21 metres running at 0.66g/t gold, potentially confirming a huge-scale mineralised system. Drilling has confirmed that the felsite breccia pipe, the primary host rock, extends beyond known limits. Better still, the mineralisation appears to line up neatly with the magneto-telluric (MT) resistivity model, tracking straight into the high-conductivity zones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These consistently strong intercepts confirm that wide zones of gold mineralisation extend beyond our current mineral resource boundaries,\u2019 Dateline Resources managing director Stephen Baghdadi The company says the results have reinforced the MT survey as a high-confidence, broad-based targeting tool for identifying gold-bearing conductive anomalies across the property. RC drilling reached up to 300 metres deep, close to the practical limit of the rig. Notably, even at those depths, the drill bit never punched out of the breccia, strongly hinting that the system remains open at depth and that more mineralisation could be lurking beneath. To test that upside, diamond core drill rigs will now replace the RC rigs. Diamond drilling can penetrate significantly deeper and retrieve continuous core samples, enabling more detailed geological and grade analysis. Darteline Resources managing director Stephen Baghdadi said: \u201cThese consistently strong intercepts at the North Pit and surrounding areas confirm that wide zones of gold mineralisation extend beyond our current mineral resource boundaries, highlighting significant expansion potential.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDateline says starting mining beneath the North Pit could materially enhance production in the early years, with the area pencilled in as the first mining focus under the development plan. The pit is already partially developed, effectively stripping away years of pre-strip and access work and allowing faster, lower-cost access to ore. Recent drilling has also confirmed thick, continuous mineralisation sitting directly below the pit floor. By bringing these wide, near-surface zones into the schedule early, the operation could deliver strong tonnages at consistent grades, supporting a smooth ramp-up and helping the plant reach nameplate throughput sooner. The company\u2019s drilling program is part of an ongoing campaign to support Dateline\u2019s bankable feasibility study and progressively upgrade the resource into higher-confidence categories. The project already hosts 27.1 million tonnes grading 1.26g/t gold for 1.1 million ounces, with more than 67 per cent classified as measured and indicated. The project sits within the prolific Walker Lane Trend in eastern San Bernardino County, less than 10 kilometres from the Mountain Pass rare earths mine. The district has a rich mining pedigree dating back to the Californian gold rush of 1848 and hosts multiple multi-million-ounce gold deposits, along with scattered fluorite, antimony and tungsten prospects. Historically, exploration focused almost exclusively on two known breccia pipes, with 1.4 million ounces of gold defined in the upper 250 metres, including 344,000 ounces already mined and the existing 1.1-million-ounce resource.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotably, gold occurs predominantly as free gold with minor silver and is closely associated with sulphide mineralisation, chiefly pyrite. It typically resides in fractures within pyrite or along grain boundaries, a deportment style that is easy for efficient downstream processing. Economically, the project carries a post-tax net present value of US$550 million (A$850 million) and an internal rate of return above 60 per cent, based on a conservative gold price of US$2900 per ounce. With gold now trading well above US$4000 per ounce, those metrics could climb sharply as feasibility work progresses. Dateline has forecast total production of 635,000 ounces of gold over an initial 8.3-year mine life, with average annual output of 71,000 ounces grading 1.3g/t gold and a recovery rate of 92 per cent. With assays continuing to flow and deeper drilling ahead, the latest results reinforce the open-at-depth potential beneath the pits and point toward a larger, higher-quality resource base as the California gold story continues to unfold.

Got it Share\n\nAustralia\u2019s olive oil industry is booming, as the Mediterranean diet\u2019s popularity coincides with a global supply crisis that has led to soaring demand, including premium offerings of wine-style tastings and pairings with gelato and coffee. The momentum of Australia\u2019s olive oil sector reached new heights in the past fortnight with news that ASX-listed heavyweight Cobram Estate had bought US producer California Olive Ranch in a $259 million deal that had been 11 years in the making. Cobram, which has a market capitalisation of more than $1.8 billion and has groves in Victoria and the United States, sells under a range of brands that also includes Red Island, with products stocked in Coles and Woolworths and increasingly exported. Harvesting of olives in Victoria to be pressed by Mount Zero Olives to produce its extra virgin olive oil. Mount Zero Olives The acquisition comes as Australian producers ramp up their output in response to an olive oil rush brought on by shortfalls out of Mediterranean countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlive oil makers in Italy, Spain and Greece \u2013 which have traditionally been responsible for more than two thirds of global production \u2013 are still reeling from years of severe heat and drought conditions that started in 2022. Spain, which typically produces about 1.4 million tonnes of olive oil each year, saw harvests plummet to below 700,000 tonnes. \u201cSouthern Europe has been hit by two extremely difficult seasons, and while production is improving, it remains well below earlier highs,\u201d Gerry Karam, ANZ\u2019s head of food, beverage and agribusiness, said. Prices eased through 2024 from record levels \u2013 at one point reaching about $15,000 a tonne \u2013 but appear to be climbing again, Karam said. \u201dThat volatility has been challenging for consumers, but it has created genuine opportunity for newer producers such as Australia,\u201d he said. Extra virgin olive oil being pressed by Mount Zero Olives during the 2025 harvest. Mount Zero Olives\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralian olive oil has a reputation as a premium, more expensive product, but the shortage has seen restaurants turn their searches to the local sector, Karam said. This past season, local production was roughly 20,000 tonnes, supplying about one third of domestic consumption. That contribution is expected to grow further, ANZ\u2019s latest Food for Thought insight report found. \u201cGlobal production will eventually normalise, but the market has fundamentally changed,\u201d Karam said. \u2018No longer a niche ingredient\u2019 Australia\u2019s olive oil industry\u2019s focus remains on high-quality extra virgin oil (EVOO), the highest grade made with just one pressing, and without the need to refine the product to remove defects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond its status as a gourmet cooking oil, EVOO has emerged as a health food. Its high polyphenol content \u2013 an antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation and improve cholesterol, among other benefits \u2013 is proving to be a lucrative attribute for EVOO producers. This was acknowledged by Cobram Estate when announcing its Californian expansion. Chairman Rob McGavin told the Australian Financial Review \u2033\u2063every day there are articles on extra virgin olive oil and its benefits\u201d. Richard Seymour, general manager of Mount Zero Olives Mount Zero Olives Health conscious consumers come from all walks of life. \u201cFor older consumers it may be seen as improving heart health and moderation, while for younger ones it ties in with natural eating, wellness and authenticity,\u201d ANZ\u2019s insights found. Karam said the publicity of olive oil as a health food has meant it\u2019s \u201cno longer a niche ingredient. It is part of daily cooking, supported by health trends, and the appeal of the Mediterranean diet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat shift is driving interest in provenance, freshness and trusted brands \u2013 areas where Australian producers excel,\u201d Karam said. Adding to the appeal is that Australia\u2019s counter-season harvests come to market just as northern hemisphere stocks run low. Gelato paired with extra virgin olive oil at a collaboration event between Bottega 1900 and Rivareno gelato. Rivareno Gelato Mount Zero Olives, which draws produce from Victoria\u2019s Wimmera and Grampians, has been \u201cflooded by inquiries\u201d, said general manager Richard Seymour. \u201cWhen the European supply really suffered, we noticed this almost insatiable demand to inquire about Australian olive oil,\u201d said Seymour, whose premium olive oil business has largely moved to sourcing and pressing the fruits after his family sold properties where it previously farmed groves. \u201cSuddenly we were going from hatted restaurants, our bread and butter for years, to pubs and all kinds of eateries we thought we\u2019d never supply,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness is so strong, Mount Zero now has to reject some inquiries from restaurants to ensure they meet demand for long-time customers. However, Seymour cautions that while revenue might be up due to price rises, cost-conscious chefs and consumers might look to buy less in volume terms and move to alternatives if prices climb further. Seymour also notes the relatively small yield from each olive when making EVOO means margins are tight. \u201cIf you\u2019re making grape juice, 90 per cent of the juice out of a grape is marketable, but with olives, it\u2019s somewhere between 10-20 per cent,\u201d he said. To make a standard 500ml bottle of EVOO can require as much as 5 kilograms of olives. Enea La Mantia, of Sydney\u2019s Bottega 1900 and Olive Oil Hub, tasting extra virgin olive oil Early harvesting of the fruit leads to a smaller yield but more complex taste, while the producers of lower quality, flatter tasting products might wait for groves to mature to get higher yields from each press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassaria, who imports largely from Italy and sells them with listings of their polyphenol content, said that awareness and interest in specialty EVOO has taken off in Australia in the past few years. As a qualified sommelier and wine director in Sydney\u2019s restaurant scene, she is hoping to bring the same level of integrity to olive oil. Enea La Mantia at a recent extra virgin olive oil tasting event run by Bottega 1900 in Sydney. Bottega 1900 Since launching in 2020, Bottega 1900 also organises olive oil tasting evenings, similar to wine-style events. Initially it was chefs and specialised customers most involved with tastings, but Massaria said this has expanded. \u201cReactions [at tastings] are often revelatory for people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey show that premium extra virgin olive oil isn\u2019t limited to the kitchen bench\u2026many Australians are only just beginning to discover its true potential.\u201d Massaria \u2013 who spoke from Italy, where she is visiting producers ahead of new season European harvests arriving in Australia for sale from February \u2013 has previously collaborated with gelato chain Rivaereno in pairing different olive oils to drizzle over frozen scoops. One of its fine-dining restaurant customers also added EVOO-topped gelato to its menu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese unorthodox pairings let the various flavour profiles of EVOO shine through, something she believes Australians are clocking onto. \u201cGreen, grassy notes, subtle pepperiness, and light bitterness, sensations that can initially feel unfamiliar \u2026 are increasingly recognised as positive sensory indicators rather than flaws,\u201d Massaria said.

Got it Share\n\nQueenslanders are paying nearly $50 in out-of-pocket costs to visit a doctor, despite the number of bulk-billing services nearly doubling across the state in the past year, a report shows. The data, released on Monday by healthcare directory Cleanbill, puts the average out-of-pocket cost to visit a GP in Queensland at $48.58 \u2013 $5.25 higher than in 2025. Federal government incentives have influenced a rise in bulk billing services across Australia, but many patients are still paying high out-of-pocket costs to see a GP. Joe Armao This is despite the number of bulk-billing clinics nearly doubling, with more than 400 of the state\u2019s 1361 practices offering bulk-billing services. The release of Cleanbill\u2019s report followed the federal government\u2019s expansion of the Bulk Billing Practice Incentive Program (BBPIP) in November, which increased incentives for GP clinics to fully bulk bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Healthcare This $8.5b Medicare promise was at the heart of Labor\u2019s election pitch. How\u2019s it working? According to the report\u2019s analysis of GP clinics operating from the start of November to mid-December, the trend towards declining bulk-billing practices has been reversed, with the percentage of fully bulk-billing clinics increasing to more than 40 per cent nationally. But rising healthcare costs remain a concern for most Australians. In some states, the average cost of a standard GP appointment now costs more than $100, with out-of -pockets expenses totalling about $60 for patients in the ACT and Tasmania. The Royal College of General Practitioners 2025 Health of the Nation report found the proportion of patients always being bulk billed remained low, with more people delaying GP care to cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Albanese government introduced a 12.5 per cent loading payment on Medicare rebates for clinics that fully bulk billed, RACGP has called for a 40 per cent increase in Medicare funding for consults that last more than 20 minutes. \u201cMedicare data shows that most GP visits continue to be delivered without cost,\u201d RACGP president Dr Michael Wright said. \u201cHowever, [our] Health of the Nation report highlights that consultation complexity and average length are both rising. At the same time, Medicare rebates have not kept pace with the cost of care for many practices. \u201cSo it is not surprising to see that out-of-pocket costs are increasing where new incentives do not cover the cost of providing care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that all Australians have affordable access to GP services, particularly those people with complex health conditions who need more time with their GP.\u201d Start the day with a summary of the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

Got it Share\n\nAdelaide Festival chair Tracey Whiting has resigned, becoming the fourth board member to quit over the decision to remove Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah from the Writers\u2019 Week program. Tracey Whiting has resigned as chair of the Adelaide Festival Board. Whiting announced her resignation in a post to LinkedIn on Sunday evening, writing \u201cRecent decisions were bound by certain undertakings and my resignation enables the Adelaide Festival, as an organisation, to refresh its leadership and its approach to these circumstances.\u201d She did not offer further comment. With only three remaining members \u2013 Leesa Chesser, Adelaide city councillor Mary Couros, and Brenton Cox \u2013 former Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week director Jo Dyer said on BlueSKy the board was now in breach of the Adelaide Festival Corporation Act which states, \u201cAt least 2 members must be women and at least 2 must be men.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast Thursday, the Adelaide Festival board announced that while it was not suggesting \u201cin any way\u201d that Abdel-Fattah or her writing had any connection with the Bondi attack, given her past statements \u201cit would not be culturally sensitive to continue to program her at this unprecedented time so soon after Bondi\u201d. Related Article Opinion\n\nCensorship Politicians shouldn\u2019t decide who appears at writers\u2019 festivals. It\u2019s a dangerous path Richard Flanagan Writer The move prompted dozens of authors to pull out of the festival, including best-selling Australian author Trent Dalton. On Monday, Dyer \u2013 who ran the event from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 said on Radio National there had been pressure over the line-up in the past but that she and other directors pushed back. This time, however, she said the board had \u201cbuckled\u201d and would no longer be able to legally function. \u201cClearly, it puts the board in an invidious position to their discredit. They were not able to withstand that pressure as they should have. But now we don\u2019t have a functioning organisation, and it is the people of Adelaide and South Australia who are the victims of this debacle,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2024, Abdel-Fattah was among the signatories to a letter to Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week requesting the removal of New York-based opinion writer Thomas Friedman from the line-up because of his comments in a New York Times article comparing the situation in the Middle East to the animal kingdom. However, in a response seen by this masthead, dated February 9, 2024, the festival board rejected this petition. Signed by the (now former) chair of the board Tracey Whiting, it reads: \u201cAsking the Adelaide Festival and Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week to cancel an artist or writer is an extremely serious request. We have an international reputation for supporting artistic freedom of expression.\u201d Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah. Speaking to the Guardian on Sunday, Abdel-Fattah rejected any allegation of hypocrisy. \u201cFriedman\u2019s widely criticised NYT article compared various Arab and Muslim nations and groups to insects and vermin requiring eradication at a time when talk of \u2018human animals\u2019 was being used to justify wholesale slaughter in Gaza,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were concerned about the impact of Friedman\u2019s views on socially and historically marginalised people who have been dehumanised and discriminated against by the use of such racist tropes. Indeed, one of the examples we supplied was how Jewish people have historically been likened to vermin. Related Article Literature Board members quit Adelaide Festival as dumped writer calls in lawyer \u201cIn contrast, I was cancelled because my presence and identity as a Palestinian was deemed \u2018culturally insensitive\u2019 and linked to the Bondi atrocity. I was cancelled because I, a Palestinian, have been a vocal advocate against the actual extermination of my people.\u201d The Adelaide Festival did not respond to questions about the incident. The Adelaide Advertiser reports that former Adelaide Festival board member Tony Berg resigned in October, citing concerns Writers\u2019 Week director Louise Adler \u201cdid not warn the board that she had already made an offer to Randa Abdel-Fattah\u201d and, given her anti-Zionist stance, he could not \u201cin all conscience\u201d remain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbdel-Fattah sent a legal letter to the festival on Sunday, demanding to know why she had been disinvited from the event.
