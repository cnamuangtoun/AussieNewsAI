It said part of the lower court's order requiring the government to \"effectuate\" his return was unclear and needed further review.\n\nThe court did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned. The opinion was unsigned and no dissents were noted.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura speaks during a news conference at CASA's Multicultural Centre in Hyattsville, Maryland. (Jose Luis Magana/AP via CNN)\n\n\"Although the ruling makes clear that the district court can order the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, it is maddeningly vague about exactly how it's supposed to do so,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Centre.\n\n\"For instance, if the judge asks the government about the specific arrangements it's made with the Salvadoran government and the government invokes the state secrets privilege, what happens then?\" Vladeck added.\n\n\"It is, yet again, punting in a context in which the government can take advantage of the punt \u2013 a loss for Trump on the big question, but a loss for Abrego Garc\u00eda on what matters most.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Stocks tumbles as China tariffs set even higher than thought\n\nThis undated photo provided by CASA, an immigrant advocacy organization, in April 2025, shows Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

    "text": "US egg prices increased again last month to reach a new record-high of US$6.23 (A$10) per dozen despite President Donald Trump 's predictions, a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.\n\nThe increase reported Thursday in the Consumer Price Index means consumers and businesses that rely on eggs might not get much immediate relief. Demand for eggs is typically elevated until after Easter, which falls on April 20.\n\nIndustry experts were expecting the index to reflect a drop in retail egg prices because wholesale egg prices fell significantly in March. University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said the wholesale prices did not start dropping until mid-March, so there may not have been enough time for the average price for the month to decline. And grocery stores may not have immediately passed on the lower prices.\n\nREAD MORE: Stocks tumbles as China tariffs set even higher than thought\n\nBird flu has killed millions of chickens across the US. (Adobe Stock)\n\nThe bird flu effect\n\nBird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease. Only 2.1 million birds were slaughtered in March and none of them were on egg farms.\n\nEgg prices hit US$5.90 (A$9.49) in February one month after setting a record at US$4.95 (A$7.96) per dozen, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe farms that had fall outbreaks have been working to resume egg production after sanitising their barns and raising new flocks, but chickens must be about six months old before they start laying eggs. Thompson said those farms did not come back online as quickly as anticipated.\n\nIn the latest US Department of Agriculture numbers, there were only about 285 million hens laying eggs nationwide as of March 1. Before the outbreak, the flock typically numbered more than 315 million.\n\nSince the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.\n\nEgg prices have soared in recent years. (Adobe Stock)\n\nEgg price politics\n\nTrump tried to take credit for the lower wholesale egg prices the USDA reported in recent weeks.\n\n\"The egg prices they were going through the sky. And you did a fantastic job,\" Trump said to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins before he announced the details of his tariffs at the White House last week. \"Now we have lots of eggs and they are much cheaper now.\"\n\nBut experts say the president's plan to fight bird flu by focusing on strengthening egg farmers' defences against the virus is likely to be more of a long-term help.\n\nThe Agriculture Department tried to find egg imports to add to the supply and nearly 4 million dozens of eggs were brought into the country in February. But egg traders saw an opportunity with the high prices and 7.6 million dozens were exported. Numbers for March were not yet available.\n\n\"I think there are lots of people who are looking to see the egg prices coming down because they wanted to call it a win. And I think it's a loss for everybody. I think we all want to see egg prices come down,\" Thompson said.\n\nRollins on Thursday suggested the rise in egg prices is temporary. She pointed to the overall consumer price index showing a slight dip in prices for goods and services across the US economy in March and suggested egg prices will soon follow.\n\n\"We're also moving into the Super Bowl of eggs, which is Easter,\" Rollins said. \"So from the beginning, I've said this is sort of the high price for retail for eggs, but we feel very confident that will continue to come back down.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Trump said the annual White House egg roll would use real eggs again this year despite the high prices. Egg farmers typically donate more than 30,000 eggs for the event.\n\nA carton of eggs sits on a kitchen counter. (AP)\n\nEgg prices around the country\n\nUS egg prices did began falling in mid-March, according to Datasembly, a market research company that tracks prices at thousands of stores. Datasembly said eggs averaged US$5.98 (A$9.62) per dozen the week beginning March 16 and dropped to US$5.51 (A$8.86) the week beginning March 30.\n\nBut prices vary widely around the country, depending on the location of recent bird flu outbreaks and some state laws requiring eggs to be cage-free. At a Walmart in Richmond, California, a dozen eggs were US$6.34 (A$10.20) on Thursday. In Omaha, Nebraska, Walmart was selling eggs for US$4.97 (A$7.99) per dozen. California requires eggs sold to be cage-free; Nebraska doesn't.\n\nThe latest numbers could increase scrutiny of Cal-Maine Foods, which provides 20 per cent of the nation's eggs, and other large egg producers.\n\nEarlier this week, Cal-Maine acknowledged it is being investigated by the antitrust division of the US Department of Justice, which is looking into egg price increases. Cal-Maine said it is cooperating with the investigation.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, which ended March 1, Cal-Maine said its net income more than tripled to US$508.5 million (A$817 million) compared to the same period a year ago.\n\nFaking it\n\nThe price of real eggs has some consumers turning to fake ones for Easter crafts this year.\n\nCraft retailer Michaels said sales of its plastic egg craft kits \u2014 which were listed for US$2.49 (A$4) on the company's website Thursday \u2014 are up 20 per cent over last year. Michaels said sales usually peak closer to Easter, but it started seeing a noticeable uptick in early March this year.\n\n\"With a little over a week still to go until Easter, our craft egg kits are nearly sold out,\" the company said.",

    "text": "The Prada Group has announced a deal to buy crosstown Milan fashion rival Versace from the US luxury group Capri Holdings under terms that values one of the most recognisable names in Italian fashion at $2.2 billion.\n\nThe deal will put Versace, known for sexy silhouettes and bold Greco and Medusa motifs, under the same roof as Prada\u2019s \u201cugly chic\u201d aesthetic and the youth-driven Miu Miu whose stunning growth in recent years has far outpaced the market. Prada said the 47-year-old Versace brand offered \u201csignificant untapped growth potential\".\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the strength for our group. There are no overlaps in terms of creativity, in terms of customer,\u2033 said Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada\u2019s chief marketing officer, who is being groomed to one day take over the business that his parents \u2014 Miuccia Prada, the group's creative force and largest shareholder, and Patrizio Bertelli, its chairman and executive director \u2014 have turned into a global fashion juggernaut.\n\nThe logo and lettering of the Versace brand. (dpa/picture alliance via Getty I)\n\n\u201cWe are buying a brand with huge potential, with a very recognizable aesthetic,\" Lorenzo Bertelli said, underlining that the Versace brand name recognition, putting it among the top 10 in the world, far outweighs its business performance.\n\nThe final value of the deal will be adjusted at closing, which is expected in the second half of the year, the Prada Group said. It will be funded by 1.5 billion euros in new debt and has been approved by the Prada and Capri Holdings board of directors.\n\nPrada Chief Executive Andrea Guerra said the deal was aimed at building a \u201csustainable revenue growth\u201d and boosting the brand's identity, and was not about squeezing synergies.\n\nPrada's statement underlined that Versace will \u201cmaintain its creative DNA and cultural authenticity, \u201d while benefitting from its \u201cindustrial capabilities, retail execution and operations expertise. \u201d\n\nThe Versace Fall RTW 2025 fashion show is a key part of Milan Fashion Week. (WWD via Getty Images)\n\nThere are no plans to change the CEO and Miuccia Prada will not be involved in the creative side of Versace, the executives said. Guerra added that the recent creative shakeup at Versace, with Miu Miu head of design Dario Vitale replacing Donatella Versace as creative director effective April 1, had nothing to do with the deal. He called it \u201can independent, very personal\u201d decision by Vitale.\n\nLorenzo Bertelli said the experience of Miu Miu's growth had shown that small changes can make all the difference. \u201dWe don't need to change the brand, revolutionize it. We need to just evolve it, make the right things happen, and all together they are hopefully going to bring a huge spark and bring back Versace to be a huge success,'' he said.\n\nCapri Holdings, which owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, paid $3.2 billion for Versace in 2018, but had been struggling to position Versace\u2019s bold profile in the recent era of \u201cquiet luxury.\u2033\n\nVersace represented 20 per cent of Capri Holdings 2024 revenue of 5.2 billion euros. An analyst presentation for the Prada deal said that Versace would represent 13 per cent of the Prada Group's pro-forma revenues, with Miu Miu coming in at 22 per cent and Prada at 64 per cent. The Prada Group, which also includes Church\u2019s footwear, reported a 17 per cent boost in revenues to 5.4 billion euros last year.\n\nDonatella Versace, who took over as creative director at the fashion house founded by her brother, Gianni Versace, after his 1997 murder, continues with the fashion house in the new role of chief brand ambassador.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely delighted to become part of the Prada family,'' she wrote in a post on Instagram beneath a photograph of herself and Miuccia Prada. \u201dI am honored to have the brand in the hands of such a trusted Italian family business, and I am ready to support this new era for the brand in any way I can.\u201d\n\nThe Italian government welcomed a deal that appears to secure Versace's longer term future as other family-owned fashion brands have faltered or even disappeared after opening up to outside investors.",

    "text": "Before this month, affordable IVF treatment was out-of-reach for women like Carly.\n\nThe Melbourne mother-of-one began the long and financially draining process of qualifying for subsidised IVF under Medicare as a single mum in 2022.\n\nCarly forked out $10,000 on two intrauterine insemination (IUI) procedures at age 37 to prove she was infertile and make herself eligible for the government rebate.\n\nSolo mum Carly went through two IUI procedures to be eligible for a rebate. (Supplied)\n\nIt wasn't until April 1 that the Medicare definition of \"infertility\" in Australia was extended to include single and LGBTIQ+ women, meaning they can access subsidised IVF treatments without needing to prove infertility first.\n\nIf this announcement took place a few years ago, Carly would have skipped this painful box-ticking exercise.\n\n\"I remember telling my parents, 'I have to complete two IUI cycles to be deemed infertile before commencing IVF with rebates'. I was a bit shocked, especially in this day and age,\" Carly told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"It just baffled me. I hadn't realised that was going to happen until I was in the process.\"\n\nTo be eligible for the rebate, Carly had to pay for two IUI treatments, which didn't work.\n\nThat came with its own heartbreak and grief.\n\n\"I wrote down everything from my parking to my medication and appointments, all things included, it cost me just over $10,000,\" Carly said.\n\n\"I didn't have limitless money or time, because now I'm 39, and you not only have to put in the money and time, with administering needles and medication, you're also going through so much emotionally and physically.\"\n\nThe two failed IUIs meant Carly then qualified for an IVF rebate, eventually saving her around $6000 all up.\n\nThe IVF rebate scheme differs from state-to-state.\ufeff\n\nShe welcomed her son, Rylan, six months ago.\n\nCarly said she's lucky it only took one round of IVF to fall pregnant.\n\nIf she didn't have the rebate to fall back on, a second try may not have been an option.\n\nShe's glad other solo mothers won't need to jump through the hoops she did.\n\n\"I think it's fantastic news. It could be the difference that means you can afford doing another round and getting a baby,\" Carly added.\n\nFellow single mother Rikki was in a very similar boat.\n\nThe Queensland mum didn't want to wait, however, and skipped IUI to pay for her almost $20,000 treatment fully out-of-pocket.\n\nRikki and her son Jasper. (Supplied)\n\nRikki told 9news.com.au she fell pregnant with son Jasper at age 33 after saving up for years.\n\n\"When I first considered it, I had assumed I would be eligible for Medicare rebate,\" Rikki explained.\n\n\"I was really frustrated... I pay taxes, I have private health, I've always done all those right things, yet I wasn't covered.\"\n\nNow happily raising an 18-month-old, Rikki said she's pleased the financial barrier to single motherhood isn't as high to climb.\n\nThough she said the announcement from the federal government went under the radar during a jam-packed election campaign, Rikki hopes the news will reach the right people.\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\"There is a whole spectrum of people doing this,\" she said.\n\n\"I think reducing kind of those financial barriers is essential to making sure that this is actually an option for all women and not just well-financed women.\"\n\nAlisha Burns, who created the Solo Mum Society, agreed with Rikki and said the \"long over-due change\" will help single women everywhere achieve their goal of motherhood.\n\n\"Updating the Medicare definition of infertility to include solo mums is a massive step forward in recognising that there's no one 'right' way to create a family\u2014and that not having a partner shouldn't be a barrier to accessing fertility support,\" she said.\n\n\"As someone who went through multiple rounds of IVF on my own and now supports thousands of women through Solo Mum Society, I know how disheartening it's been for single women to be told they have to 'prove' infertility when all that's missing is a partner.\"\n\nRikki said she was glad other single mums won't have such a big barrier to access IVF. (Supplied)\n\nThe extended definition, announced by Assistant Health Minister Ged Kearney, also hugely impacts LGBTIQ+ people wanting to have a child.\n\nThe queer community, which has long lobbied for such a change, is celebrating this win in Australia.\n\n\"We've heard from community for a long time now about the discrimination they face when starting a family using an IVF clinic,\" said Executive Officer of Rainbow Families Ashley Scott.\n\n\"Some people were able to access the Medicare rebate on their first attempt, while others had to prove they were medically infertile \u2014 sometimes after three failed rounds of IVF or IUI. Even within the same clinics, there was a lack of consistency.\"\n\n\"We've been actively lobbying the Federal Government to ensure that LGBTQ+ people are treated like any other family,\" Scott added.",

    "text": "The stock market was soaring and the sun was shining when US President Donald Trump stepped out of the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon. Less than two hours earlier, he had retreated from his plans to increase tariffs on many US trading partners, and investors were rejoicing after bracing for a global economic meltdown.\n\n\"You've got the markets seeing your brilliance,\" Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, told the president.\n\nTrump agreed. \"Nobody's ever heard of it,\" he declared.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House. (AP)\n\nIt was a typical bit of hyperbole that, in this case, was true. Even by the standards of Trump's second term, the saga that had played out over the past week left the world struggling to catch its breath.\n\nThe president, of his own doing, had single-handedly pushed the global economy to the brink of chaos with new tariffs. The stock market cratered, businesses tore up their plans and foreign leaders prepared for a future without the world's richest nation at the centre of international trade.\n\nAnd then Trump backed down. Seven days after announcing what would have amounted to America's largest tax hike since World War II in an elaborate Rose Garden ceremony, he rolled back most of the tariffs in a surprise post on his social media website.\n\n\"I think the word would be flexible,\" he said later despite days of insisting that he wouldn't bend. \"You have to be flexible.\"\n\nUncertainty lingers as trade talks continue\n\nIt was unclear what the president had accomplished, beyond the satisfaction of, in his words, having other countries \"kissing my ass\" to try to talk him out of the tariffs. No new trade deals have been reached, although administration officials said negotiations are underway.\n\nHowever, real damage has been done. The back-and-forth over tariffs shook confidence in U.S. leadership, exposed fractures within Trump's team and rattled companies that rely on global sources for products and international customers for sales. Americans who use the stock market to save for retirement and college suffered days of angst.\n\nExport vehicles are parked at Daikoku Pier in Yokohama, near Tokyo. (AP)\n\nThe turmoil isn't over yet, either. Trump's 10 per cent blanket tariffs initially imposed on Saturday are now applied to dozens of nations. He also jacked up tariffs to 125 per cent on imports from China, leaving the world bracing for a showdown between the first and second largest economies. There are 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's largest trading partners, as well as 25 per cent taxes on imported autos, steel and aluminum.\n\nOther tariffs \u2014 including 24 per cent on Japan, 25 per cent on South Korea, 20 per cent on the European Union \u2014 are on hold for 90 days to allow for trade talks.\n\n\"This just accentuates the policy uncertainty and sense of unreliability Trump is creating,'' said William Reinsch, a former US trade official now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. While Reinsch said it's good news that Trump didn't move forward with some of his highest tariffs, \"how does anybody know that he won't change his mind on Friday or next week?\"\n\nTrump makes his announcement on 'Liberation Day'\n\nUS flags were draped along the White House colonnade for a red-white-and-blue backdrop when Trump announced his tariffs on Wednesday, April 2.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day,\" he said. The president held up a poster listing the tariffs that he would slap on each country \u2014 32 per cent for Thailand, 49 per cent for Cambodia, 26 per cent for India, and on and on.

And around the country and the world, the fallout spread over the weekend.\n\nFulcrum Coffee Roasters in Seattle braced for rising costs for beans from Southeast Asia and espresso machines from Italy. Stellantis, the automaker behind brands like Jeep and Ram, announced it would pause production at plants in Mexico and Canada, leading to temporary layoffs at other facilities in Indiana and Michigan, a reminder of how interconnected vehicle supply chains have become.\n\nThe Dutch division of Tata Steel said it would cut 1600 employees, about a fifth of its workforce. Ireland Prime Minister Michael Martin said \"there is no way to sugar coat\" the situation as business with the US started tapering off.\n\nTrump faces growing pushback from his own party\n\nThe markets were still in a panic on Monday when an unverified report circulated that the president was considering a 90-day pause on the tariffs. Stocks briefly soared before investors realised the information was wrong.\n\n\"We're not looking at that,\" Trump said as hopes for the rumored reprieve vanished.\n\nWorkers stitch garments at a factory run by the Bangladesh based Urmi Group in Narayanganj. (AP)\n\nWith fears of a recession growing, Republican lawmakers returning to the Capitol for the workweek were peppered with questions about the tariffs and what they would do in response.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin was asked on Tuesday if he understood Trump's strategy, and responded by asking \"does anybody?\" Some of his state's premier companies like Kohl's expected higher costs, while its dairy farms expected to struggle to sell milk and cheese. Harley-Davidson was a target of planned reciprocal tariffs by the European Union.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina was even more blunt that day during a hearing with Trump's top trade representative, Jamieson Greer. If the tariff plans don't work, he said, \"I'm just trying to figure out whose throat I need to choke.\"\n\nTrump retreats, and aides call it part of the strategy all along\n\nThe tariffs on allies like Japan, South Korea and the European Union took effect at 12.01am on Wednesday, and there were no signs that Trump would back down when the sun came up in Washington.\n\n\"BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well,\" he posted on Truth Social.\n\nContainers with Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation, a Taiwanese container shipping company, are stacked up at the Port of Los Angeles.

The president later said he'd been talking with his aides that morning about pausing the tariffs, an announcement that would send the stock market soaring.\n\nGreer was back on Capitol Hill for another hearing when Trump made his announcement.\n\nRep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, asked if Trump's trade representative knew that the tariffs he had just spent at least two hours defending had been paused.\n\n\"I understand the decision was made a few minutes ago,\" Greer said.\n\nHorsford erupted, saying \"this is amateur hour, and it needs to stop.\"\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt scolded reporters for not understanding the president's plans.\n\n\"Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,\" she said, referencing Trump's book from 1987. \"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here.\"\n\nBut the administration sent mixed messages even as it rolled back the tariffs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House.

    "text": "A Sydney retail worker has told how a tiny cut he got at work unexpectedly turned into a nightmarish, life-threatening injury.\n\nYvohn Ray Rosero, an international student from the Philippines, was working at a clothing store in Burwood when the seemingly innocuous accident happened.\n\n\"I was just doing my normal opening shift and I was trying to organise some denim pants in front of the store with some discount signage,\" Rosero told 9news.com.au.\n\nA small cut on a finger at work turned into a life-threatening infection for Yvohn Ray Rosero. (Supplied)\n\n\"I bumped my left index finger on the corner of the metal sign. It bled a little and created a small wound.\"\n\nNot thinking much of it, Rosero stopped the bleeding with a tissue, washed his finger and finished off his shift.\n\nIt wasn't until the next morning that Rosero started to feel a little off.\n\n\"When I woke up I could feel the stiffness in my left index finger. And then, after I showered, I started to feel shivery,\" he said.\n\nNot wanting to let his employer down, Rosero put a fresh bandaid on his finger and went in to work.\n\nA co-worker noticed Rosero did not look well and advised him to get medical attention straight away, so he went to the emergency department at Westmead Hospital.\n\n\"After a long wait of almost six hours, I was finally seen \u2014 and by that point, the infection had spread all the way to my left elbow,\" Rosero said.\n\n\"My finger had already turned necrotic. I was admitted right away.\"\n\nRosero sought help at the Westmead Hospital in Western Sydney. (Nine)\n\nDoctors told Rosero his infection was spreading alarmingly fast and had turned septic.\n\nLater that same day, Rosero was diagnosed with Necrotising Fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating bacteria.\n\nThe rare but aggressive infection spreads quickly and destroys tissue beneath the skin.\n\nRosero was admitted to the intensive care unit and has since undergone six surgeries in an attempt to get the infection under control.\n\nWhile doctors had initially been hopeful they could save Rosero's index finger, it eventually needed to be amputated.\n\nRosero said the experience was traumatic, but he was thankful for the doctors and nurses who cared for him.\n\n\"I never thought that a small, very tiny wound could change my life forever,\" he said.\n\nRosero is now facing a month off work while he recovers and an online fundraiser has been started to help with his medical and living costs.\n\nThe international student, who has been living in Australia for three years, said he had learned never to underestimate any open wound, no matter how small.\n\n\"I keep telling my friends and my family to always wash a cut or wound, no matter how small. Always make sure that you have an antiseptic cream or wipes,\" he said.",

    "text": "Barossa imagery may be spearheading South Australia's latest tourism drive to capitalise on the AFL's Gather Round, but Adelaide's festivals and convenience will get a guernsey too in an episodic campaign for \"sophisticated travellers\".\n\nAdelaide's Frame Creative, in partnership with the SA Tourism Commission (SATC), this week started rolling out imagery and adverts that showcase the produce and \"simple pleasures\" of the Barossa and Fleurieu Peninsula.\n\nFrame Creative chief executive Tim Pearce said the state had been searching for a way to find its voice and a recent research paper had uncovered two key approaches, including not \"trying to be all things to all people\".\n\n\"We were picking up slightly more sophisticated travellers, those who aren't going travelling just to tick a box,\" he said.\n\n\"They don't need to fly to France to line up and take a photo of the Mona Lisa \u2026 they actually want more richness and quality from their tourism.\"\n\nThe '20-minute city'\n\nOne of Adelaide's unrivalled strengths is its scale and ease of access to the regions, to nature, to beautiful beaches and world-renowned wine regions, giving it the nickname of the \"20-minute-city\".\n\nThe campaign features artwork capturing South Australia's \"simple pleasures\". (Supplied: Frame Creative)\n\n\"We've got a place where it's very easy to experience serendipity, to experience unexpected nice things,\" Mr Pearce said.\n\n\"People come here and go, 'Oh wow. It's got a fair bit going on here, it's great', and you're like, 'Yeah, we know.'\"\n\nAdelaide, after all, is host to the largest arts festival in the southern hemisphere, when the Adelaide Fringe, the Adelaide Festival, Writers' Week and Womadelaide \u2014 events that draw nearly 100,000 tourists annually \u2014 combine to create what is known as Mad March.\n\nWomadelaide thrives as smaller city festival Photo shows Dancers at Womad Womadelaide's director says smaller cities such as Adelaide are perfect for major festivals because it's compact and residents offer loyal support.\n\nIt is all held within walking distance, with the Adelaide Motorsport Festival a recent addition to the listing.\n\n\"Here you can be picking cherries in Piccadilly and 20 minutes later be at the beach in Glenelg,\" Mr Pearce said.\n\n\"You can't get that easy, serendipitous, beautiful moment when you're fighting thousands of people on a train, or having to pay tollways to get from one side of the city to the other and it takes you two hours.\"\n\nHe said episodes that covered SA's \"broader story\" would be gradually released.\n\n\"So, unlike one and done, spending all our money on one hero ad and expecting the world to respond, we're actually putting out a more nuanced campaign that will grow and build and establish a new platform for us to have that conversation with people,\" Mr Pearce said.\n\n\"We've never had a platform to build on and there's a lot going on.\"\n\nThe rollout of the new SA tourism campaign started this week. (Supplied: Frame Creative)\n\nMoving on from past wrongs\n\nSATC chief marketing officer Erik de Roos said there was power in leveraging the fact SA had \"been designed so you can enjoy an easy, endless supply of these simple pleasures\".\n\n\"Our new brand platform looks to take ownership of this and create genuine distinction within the tourism category,\" he said.\n\nIt follows misfires by SATC in recent years, including a five-day online advert in 2018 that not even the former SA tourism minister had time to check out, and the infamous \"old mate\" advert of 2019, which left some viewers wondering if they were watching a message about depression.\n\nTourism ad controversy Photo shows Tourism SA ad causes social media furore An SA Tourism Commission ad that ends with an old man breaking down in tears is criticised for being \"depressing\", \"ageist\" and a \"terrible\" endorsement for the state.\n\nMr Pearce said the latest campaign would go live in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland first, but in the middle of the year there would be material in China, the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand.\n\n\"Materials will be tailored to each of those markets. In China we know wildlife has more of a pull so we dial that up, but right now, for people popping across the border \u2014 mostly from Victoria but probably from WA and NSW too \u2014 for the footy, Gather Round's quite relevant,\" Mr Pearce said.\n\nHe said football fans had a taste for good food and wine as well, and with tens of thousands of visitors expected to visit the Barossa this weekend to watch North Melbourne play Gold Coast, and Richmond play Fremantle, the famed wine region was gearing up for a busy weekend.\n\n\"Hopefully this encourages them just to experience a little bit more,\" Mr Pearce said.",

    "text": "Delhi Capitals have stretched their Indian Premier League winning streak to four games with a six-wicket victory, handing Royal Challengers Bengaluru a second home defeat at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.\n\nBengaluru wasted opener Phil Salt's quickfire 37 off 17 balls and was restricted to 7-163 on Thursday.\n\nWrist spinners Vipraj Nigam and Kuldeep Yadav picked up four wickets for just 35 runs in their combined eight overs.\n\nAussie pacemen Mitch Starc and Josh Hazlewood \u2014 on opposing sides playing for the Capitals and Challengers respectively \u2014 did not fare so well.\n\nBetween them, they bowled half-a-dozen overs, didn't get a sniff of a wicket and were carted around for 75 runs at 12-and-a-half an over.\n\nStarc's figures ended up at 3-0-35-0 and Hazlewood's 3-0-40-0, with Starc being plundered for 30 runs in a disastrous single, seven-ball over as England's Phil Salt went to town on the Aussie quick.\n\nDespite that, it was Starc who would have come away feeling slightly better with his day though after teammate Lokesh Rahul followed his 77 against Chennai Super Kings with another masterful unbeaten 93 off 53 balls as he led Delhi to 4-169 with more than two overs to spare.\n\nKL Rahul led Delhi to victory over the Royal Challengers Bengaluru at his home stadium in Bengaluru. (AP Photo: Aijaz Rahi)\n\nRahul soaked up the pressure of losing early wickets before counterpunching in the second half of Delhi's impeccable run-chase.\n\nFaf du Plessis scored only two off seven balls against his former franchise. Jake Fraser-McGurk (7) and Abishek Porel (7) went cheaply, skying catches to wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma off Kumar's short balls, while captain Axar Patel (15) was taken at long-off as Delhi's chase got derailed in the ninth over.\n\n\"On a wicket like this, I knew what my pockets were,\" Rahul said.\n\n\"If I wanted to hit a big six, I knew what pockets to target, and [wicket] keeping gave me a feel for where other batters were dismissed and where they hit the sixes.\"\n\nRahul raised his half century off 37 balls but upped the ante when he smashed premier Bengaluru fast bowler Hazlewood for 22 runs in the 15th over, which featured three fours and a six over long off.\n\nBengaluru missed a golden opportunity when Rajat Patidar couldn't cling onto a difficult two-handed running catch off Rahul, who finished with six sixes and seven fours as he shared Delhi's best fifth-wicket IPL stand with Stubbs.\n\n\"Got lucky with the dropped catch,\" Rahul said.\n\n\"This is my ground, my home, know it better than anyone else.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nSalt's assault against Starc helped Bengaluru raise the fastest half-century by a team in this edition of the IPL, in just three overs, with the Australian paceman's second over going for 30 runs.\n\nSalt hit four fours and three sixes before he was involved in a bizarre run-out when he slipped after Virat Kohli ran him out having initially called for a tight single before turning back.\n\nBengaluru never got back the momentum against spinners Nigam and Yadav before Tim David slammed an unbeaten 37 off 20 balls.\n\nKohli made 22 off 14 balls.\n\nBengaluru had a chance when Bhuvneshwar Kumar's two strikes had Delhi stuttering at 4-58 before Rahul and Tristan Stubbs (38 not out) combined in a match-winning unbroken 111-run stand off 55 balls.\n\nDelhi, with eight points from four successive wins, shares top spot with Gujarat Titans, which has played one more game.\n\nBengaluru, with three away wins and two home defeats, is third on six points.\n\nAP/AAP",

    "text": "Justin Vernon is 43 years old and five albums into his best-known musical project, the multi-Grammy-award-winning Bon Iver.\n\nHe's also newly in love, an important note when considering his new album Sable, Fable, an album dedicated to his new partner.\n\nListen to the full interview with Bon Iver here Photo shows Bon Iver's Justin Vernon in a white long sleeved top and black beanie with his arms folded across his chest Zan Rowe speaks with Justin Vernon in his only Australian interview about Bon Iver's first new album in six years, SABLE, fABLE.\n\n\"The whole concept is me reaching out to my counterpart, to the person I'm looking for in my life that could actually hang out with me, that I actually could do the story of life and love with,\" Vernon tells Double J's Zan Rowe in an exclusive Australian interview.\n\n\"It's a dedication to a person. They'll hear it all Friday for the first time. They've heard bits and bits and bobs, but yeah\u2026\"\n\nGoing back to move forward\n\nWithout context, that person may be alarmed by the album's beginning. Its first three songs, which were released as the Sable EP late last year, see Vernon go back to the sound of his acclaimed 2007 Bon Iver debut, For Emma, Forever Ago.\n\nOn his fifth Bon Iver album, Justin Vernon accepts what troubled him about his early fame and approaches the future with wide eyes. (Supplied: Jagjaguwar)\n\n\"I would like the feeling gone, 'Cause I don't like the way it's looking,\" he sings in the album's first verse.\n\n\"I think those three songs are very intense,\" Vernon says. \"They're very heavy, and they're asking a lot of the listener.\n\n\"They're asking the listener \u2014 they asked me, certainly \u2014 to shed a lot of blood and shed a lot of weight and energy.\n\n\"I wanted people and myself to start this whole album process looking backwards and reflecting, and looking at the present and making a choice, looking at a fork in the road. I wanted people to have time to do that.\"\n\nSpoiler: the album's mood shifts significantly from here.\n\nSable, Fable has a distinct, though not entirely linear, emotional progression, which reflects Vernon's own soul-searching of recent years.\n\n\"I wanted me to have time to absorb what it felt like to put those three songs out in the world, and then to be able to really show that the passage of time was really valuable in trying to make a change in your life.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nEven though his work on the album is done, Vernon's path to emotional enlightenment continues.\n\n\"In the six months between Sable coming out and Fable dropping this week, I've healed a lot. I've grown a lot, and I think I really have to hang it on some of this art I've been making.\"\n\nIn a musical sense, the Sable songs had fans clamouring to exalt that the \"old\" Bon Iver was back.\n\nAfter a string of warped, sometimes challenging records that highlighted Vernon and his collaborators' hunger for experimentation, these three songs felt like a return to the man in the woods who made that iconic first album.\n\n\"I think I needed to do that for myself,\" Vernon says of revisiting those indie folk roots.\n\n\" It's like, I'm going to go back and be the guy in the cabin for a second and just try on all those clothes and accept who that guy was, and also say goodbye at the same time. \"\n\nEgo is not a dirty word\n\nVernon is not the first man in his early-40s to embark on a journey of self-discovery, but not many men have lived the bulk of their adult lives in the public eye.\n\nMoreover, not many artists as successful as Vernon have been as at odds with what we consider to be the classic persona of a rock star.\n\n\"I think I'm a pretty humble guy,\" he says. \"Growing up in Wisconsin, we're taught to be humble. We're taught to make sure that people around us know that we're humble, I think that's a really great way to grow up. At the same time, we're not immune to ego.\"\n\nThe realisation that ego has unwittingly informed some of your life's decisions and personal code is a tough one to face. As Vernon proceeds through his current emotional journey, he's starting to learn more about his younger self.\n\n\"I think I took a bit of pride in, in the whole jungle of the music industry, being one of the nice guys. One of the people that didn't need any of this for my ego at all.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nIn 'Awards Season', one of the tracks that appeared on the Sable EP, Vernon sings: \"I get caught looking in the mirror on the regular. What I see there resembles some competitor.\"\n\n\"I think that line means two things,\" he explains. \"One is me accepting that there was a part of my ego that was getting served by all of this.\n\n\"Even though I'm like, 'I don't need the Grammys, I don't need this, I don't do interviews, I just love the music,' I am susceptible and not immune to the pitfalls of some of that stuff. Also, not all of it's all bad. It's OK to accept who you are and to love yourself and to think that you have something to offer the world.\n\n\"I think the other part of that line is, we compete with ourselves, or we compare ourselves to our friends and other people that we see, and it's just a nauseating, endless battle that you'll never win.\"\n\nTwo sides to a record\n\nWhile the emotional progression on Sable, Fable is not entirely linear, these two parts of the record do clearly represent very different moods.\n\n\"Sable is that darkness and Fable is this blast off of happiness and joy,\" Vernon says.\n\n\"Then, by the end, there's sort of a resolve, that it's all part of the same cycle. There's a rhythm to everything, there's never a green pasture that you will endlessly rest in. Life and energy is ever ongoing, and there's an acceptance to that that I try to find here.\"\n\nAs the first three songs that make up Sable fade away, the Fable chapter begins. The shift of mood first comes via 'Short Story', where exultant chords blast some light into the record.\n\nLearning he has the power to change his life has been a powerful revelation for Justin Vernon while making the latest Bon Iver album.\n\nThen, 'Everything Is Peaceful Love' cranks the blissful vibes up further, sounding like 70s Philly soul processed through the Bon Iver machine to make it slightly gnarled while retaining its limerence.\n\n\"Hopefully, a lot of us have felt that sort of shiny, new-love feeling,\" Vernon considers.\n\n\"Sometimes in very dark periods of your life, those moments where you're in that thing with someone that you're falling in love with, it can be very, very powerful. Because maybe the rest of your life isn't really put together.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\n\"A lot of those ecstatic ecstasy-like feelings, much like the drug, they're a little bit of a trick, even though they're beautiful.\n\n\"That song is not about necessarily all vapid love, or that it's all going to come cascading down and nobody should believe in love or anything like that. It's just that acceptance of that overwhelming feeling of ecstasy.\"\n\nEver since his debut album, an era-defining platinum record that inspired a generation of lovelorn indie balladeers, people have seen themselves in Vernon's work.\n\nWhile he's flattered to learn when he's inspired others, it wasn't always easy to accept the part he played in a stranger's emotional wellbeing.\n\n\"I just struggled a lot with the attention,\" he says. \"I struggled a lot with over exposure.\n\n\"I think what you see in Sable is me finally accepting that, that it's all been OK, and that I'm still here, and that I can change what my life is.\n\n\"If I'm not OK, it's my duty, if I have the privilege, to change my life moving forward. It takes strength and courage, and hopefully that strength and courage can also kind of be inspiring for other people.\"\n\nSex tends to go hand-in-hand with romantic love, and 'Walk Home' ensures Vernon has that part of the new-found love journey covered.\n\n\"There's always been sex in my songs and this kind of imagery and nods to the sexual,\" he says. \"But I think this time, I was like, 'We're just gonna come out and say it. Let's get in bed.'\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nWhile it's not WAP, lines like \"Pull me close up to your face / Honey, I just want the taste\" are pretty frank for Bon Iver.\n\n\"It just kind of came out naturally that way,\" Vernon says. \"I wasn't thinking like, 'Now it's time to be sexy.' It's just sort of where I've been at, coming out with it and not having it all pooled up inside and trying to make it all shadowy. It's like, let's just call it what it is.\"\n\nArriving at this point felt liberating, as Vernon realised he finally had the confidence to put this part of himself out there and not wince at the reception.\n\n\"One of the most powerful things in the world is not giving a f*** anymore,\" he says. \"You can't just say you don't, you actually have to. I think that's in that song too. There's a bunch of stuff going on there.\"\n\nGood for the goose\n\nSable, Fable is out today, and fans are already devouring its luscious sounds and amorous themes. For Vernon, however, the album has already achieved what he wanted it to do.\n\n\"Even since finishing the record, I've grown so much and learned so much,\" he says.\n\nJustin Vernon says he is coming to terms with the struggles he faced early in his career. (Supplied: Jagjaguwar)\n\n\"I recognise I was trying to find a way to tell someone how I feel about them, how much I'd been going through before I met them [and] when I met them, and now getting to know them for the rest of my life.\n\n\"Once it's out there, my work with these songs is done and that's just a really clean feeling. It's a really great feeling. I know that these songs are going to mean something to people because the chance is, if they mean this much to me, there's going to be people out there that get something out of it.\"\n\nSable, Fable is out now",

    "text": "Being a halfback anywhere in the NRL is a serious business but in New Zealand it's a bigger task than most.\n\nRightly or wrongly, just like every other halfback, he bears a large part of the pride and glory when they win and wears the shame when they lose.\n\nBut if you're doing it for the Warriors it's a horse of a different colour, because no other playmaker carries the hopes of a nation on his shoulders every single week and it's hard to step lightly with a weight that heavy.\n\nNRL's Shaun Johnson seemed forever young Photo shows A man celebrates after scoring a try in a rugby league match From the first time we saw Shaun Johnson, he was a player of limitless possibility. It's only now, with his career winding down, that he has run out of tomorrows.\n\nStacey Jones found a way to do it, as did Shaun Johnson, even as it took all their brilliance, cunning and resilience.\n\nBetween them, they played halfback for the Warriors more than 470 times and the history of the club is moulded around them \u2014 Jones as the club's first home-grown folk hero, Johnson as a dazzlingly skillful modern icon.\n\nIf they ever built a Warriors' Mt Rushmore in Auckland, they'd both be on it.\n\nSo it's fair to say Luke Metcalf, even just four games into his new life as the inheritor of that legacy, has a lot to live up to, but instead of downplaying the task ahead of him or shrinking from it, he runs towards and isn't afraid to say that this isn't just what he wants, it's what he's always wanted.\n\n\"It is [a lot], but I like that. I like that challenge of having two of the best halves to ever play the game come before me and me being the next guy to take the Warriors where they want to get to,\" Metcalf said.\n\nMetcalf's confidence, which never hints at arrogance, is striking. He's been waiting for a chance like this for a long time given the 26-year-old has walked a winding path to the scrumbase.\n\nAmid stints with Manly and Cronulla, COVID and injuries have kept him to just 30 NRL games since his belated debut in 2021 even as his talents have been obvious whenever he's played at fullback or five-eighth. He's fast enough to run through a carwash and not get wet and has a fine sense for support play.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nTranslating those gamebreaking skills to halfback, or at least keeping the best of them while piloting the team around the park as lead playmaker, is a transition that took Jones and Johnson years to master and one Metcalf is now undertaking.\n\nMetcalf knows he's still at the beginning of that process, but given he's been a halfback since he was running around for Orara Valley Tomahawks as a boy he believes dictating terms comes more naturally to him than people might think.\n\n\"I always grew up being a halfback and it might sound weird but the organising and that sort of stuff, I feel like that comes naturally to me because I've always done it,\" Metcalf said.\n\n\"But the part where I'm still growing and learning is doing that and bringing my running game to it, becoming the complete player.\n\n\"Once I get a hold of that, that's when it'll all click for me \u2014 but I'm still figuring that stuff out.\n\n\"People might not think that comes natural but I think it does for me, I'm trying to mould it all together, I'm striving for perfection and hopefully one day I'll get there.\"\n\nMetcalf was at the centre of four key moments in the win over the Tigers two weeks ago, each of which showed a different aspect of his growing role as the side's halfback.\n\nThe first was the try he scored midway through the second, where he poured through in support to finish off some nice work from five-eighth Chanel Harris-Tavita and hooker Wayde Egan.\n\nMetcalf's speed and support play, two things he already excels at, were on show as was his developing combination with Harris-Tavita and Egan, which will be crucial if the Warriors are to continue to improve.\n\n\"We all think the same way about the game, we watch a lot of video together, we spend a lot of time together in spine meetings talking about what we want to do, what we want to set up and how we want to play,\" Metcalf said.\n\n\"Webby [Andrew Webster] puts a lot of faith in myself, Wadeo and Chanel to have a voice in the game plan and talk about stuff we want to do and how we want to look each week.\"\n\nThe second was perhaps the most subtle \u2014 a sharp run from deep in his own half that generated the quick play-the-ball, which led to Leka Halasima's remarkable 80-metre try.\n\nIt's rare a team would get some ruck speed from one of their halves taking a carry inside their own quarter but it's proof that for Metcalf, creation can come in many forms.\n\nHalasima's jaunt down the sideline captured much of the attention and rightly so, but Metcalf's carry was highlighted by none other than Johnson himself as a key element to what unfolded.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThe two were halves partners for much of Johnson's renaissance year in 2023 and remain close mates, with Johnson acting as a key sounding board for Metcalf \u2014 as does Jones, who works as an assistant with the Warriors.\n\n\"Stacey's been awesome, we work very closely together and it's so cool to work with someone who's one of the best halfbacks to play the game,\" Metcalf said.\n\n\"I do a lot of kicking with him, a lot of talking around the game in general, he's so cool to work with.\n\n\"I speak to Shauny once a week still, he was one of my mates at Cronulla and then he came back to the Warriors, he's been really cool for me. He's always there if I need anything.\n\n\"It's pretty cool and an added bonus that I have them in my corner every step of the way.\"\n\nFinally came two kicks \u2014 first a conversion from out wide after Halasima's try, which levelled the scores, the second a penalty from just inside the 40-metre line to give the Warriors the lead with seven minutes to go.\n\nIt was his first game-winning kick in the NRL and Metcalf didn't just rise to the occasion, he relished it.\n\n\"I've done a lot of kicking in my life. Just trust your process, it's a big moment and you're talking to yourself in your head that it's a big moment,\" Metcalf said.\n\n\"But you live for those sort of things, especially as a kicker. You want to be in those moments and step up to the plate, it was awesome to get my first taste of it in first grade.\n\n\"I've always been like that, I've always been confident and I've always been that kid that wants the ball in my hands at the last moment.\n\n\"I want to kick the field goal, I want to kick the goal from the sideline, I've always had that in me.\n\n\"The game was going and I thought it would come down to something like that, so I wanted it in my hands and I was confident in myself that I could do that.\n\n\"I can't wait for more opportunities like that in my career.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nLike Metcalf, the Warriors as a whole are still a work in progress but the signs are promising.\n\nDespite an awful start to the season against Canberra in Las Vegas and a slew of injuries to the outside backs, they've won three in a row heading into Sunday's clash with Melbourne.\n\nNew Zealand once held the reputation of always playing the Storm well, which Jones and Johnson played a large roll in forging.\n\nBut it's now been many lean winters for the Kiwi club against the Victorians \u2014 the Storm have won the past 16 matches between the two dating back to 2016.\n\nMetcalf faces a considerable personal challenge as he goes head-to-head with another Kiwi maestro in Jahrome Hughes, who also had to bide his time to get a chance as a playmaker.\n\nTaking him and the Storm down is no easy task but it's another hard thing Metcalf is putting in his sights and by now the pattern should be clear.\n\nBe it taking a tough carry from his own line, getting the ball in his hands with the game in the balance or living up to the legacy of legends, Metcalf wants it all.",

    "text": "The first time the Premier spoke about the Tasmanian Planning Commission's scathing stadium report he described it as \"perplexing\", the following day it was \"deeply concerning\", a week later it was \"tainted\".\n\nThese may seem like throwaway descriptions, but the careful shifts in language should ring alarm bells for some, each one signifying a greater disregard for a report that raises a lot of red flags about a very expensive project the government has staked its reputation on.\n\nThat's not to say the Tasmanian government does not have its reasons.\n\nPremier Jeremy Rockliff is looking into special legislation that would allow the stadium to bypass the planning system. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nThose shifts in attitude have aligned with new evidence coming to light, such as the legal advice obtained by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC) that claimed the report is \"argumentative, lacks balance and relies on untested material\".\n\nA list of stadium problems \u2014 from crowd squeeze to bus freeze Photo shows A map showing pinch points on three out of the four sides of a stadium and nearby areas. Macquarie Point is hemmed in by a highway, a working port, heritage buildings and a knoll, with just enough space for a stadium. The Planning Commission has laid bare the problems.\n\nOr more recently, an ABC story that revealed new information about how the TPC report, was compiled, leading the Premier to question its credibility.\n\n\"We can have no longer have faith in either report, I have to say, which is disappointing, because we wanted to work through all the issues,\" Mr Rockliff said.\n\nThe author of one of the reports the TPC has relied on, Nicholas Gruen, has defended his work suggesting the government is sidelining inconvenient truths.\n\n\"Some have found an easier course irresistible: to shoot the messenger rather than deal with the message,\" Dr Gruen said.\n\nIt is worth noting Mr Rockliff is not dismissing the TPC report and the issues it raises.\n\n\"We've been clear there are challenges, and we are continuing to work through our options,\" he told the ABC.\n\nBut the trashing of the TPC's report, deserved or otherwise, suits the government's narrative.\n\nThe AFL has stated many times it will not renegotiate its deal for a Tasmanian club license. The state must deliver a roofed stadium at Macquarie Point to secure a team. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nEach dent it makes in the report's credibility paves the way for special legislation that would allow the stadium to bypass the planning system.\n\nBecause how can the government keep its pet project in a process that has produced a report it \"can no longer have faith in\"?\n\nWhy the Macquarie Point stadium is drawing 'pulp mill' comparisons Photo shows Anti-pulp mill protesters outside a Hobart court Amid the row over the proposed Hobart stadium there's been talk of it being a \"pulp mill\" moment \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nIt appears apparent that legislation to fast-track the project is now the government's preferred way to progress the stadium, buoyed by the fact Labor has offered unconditional support, regardless of the process.\n\nWhile the 'will they, won't they' go down the pulp-mill-shaped path discussion feels like it has been going on for some time, in fact it was just over a week ago that Premier Jeremy Rockliff revealed he had asked his department for advice about it.\n\nA quick history lesson. The pulp mill was a Project of State Significance in the mid 2000s but Gunns, the company behind it, pulled it out.\n\nThen Labor premier Paul Lennon recalled parliament to vote through fast-track legislation. It passed but the project fell over in the face of community opposition.\n\nBut back to the stadium, and once again, it comes down to language.\n\nStadium build in a pressure cooker\n\nLast week, Mr Rockliff was just canvassing options, days later the urgency was creeping in.\n\n\"At the very least, it throws into extreme doubt the timeline from for the project of state significance assessment,\" Mr Rockliff said.\n\n\"The clock is ticking, and we must get on with the job.\"\n\nThe proposed stadium is one of the biggest and most expensive projects in Tasmania's history. (Supplied: Macquarie Point Development Corporation)\n\nOn Wednesday this week it kicked up another notch, with Mr Rockliff referring to the \"very pressing timelines\".\n\n\"Given the fact that the Tasmania Devils are in the midst of a very important recruitment process, and the ongoing uncertainty that that sort of brings when it comes to attracting key personnel for the club, and given the fact that we are needing to get on and break ground when it comes to the training facility as well,\" Mr Rockliff told parliament.\n\n\" Timelines are crucially important, and I will do what I need to do, in terms of giving the public their say, but also ensuring that this house and the legislative council \u2026 has the opportunity to vote on this project. \"\n\nSo important that the government has refused to commit to the public hearings that were planned for June and July.\n\nHowever, Mr Rockliff has been very clear that regardless of the process, the public will have their say, pointing to the POSS process, where public submissions are open until May 8.\n\nMacquarie Point offers challenging location for a stadium build: a block of land that can only just squeeze in a football stadium between a working port, a highway, a steep knoll and a heritage streetscape. (Supplied: Macquarie Point Development Corporation)\n\nOn that urgency, it's worth pointing out that we've known for a long time the POSS process wouldn't be concluded until September. To put it in football terms, the goal posts haven't moved \u2014 yet.\n\nBut, to keep on the football theme, there is \"perceived pressure\" from the AFL and its club presidents as stadium and team deadlines creep closer \u2014 and the Tasmanian government is feeling the heat.\n\nAnd remember, it's not just about the team, but the high performance centre, the jobs and those pesky top-up payments the state will be liable for if it misses the mark.\n\nStadium legislation, likely\n\nThe urgency, the government's lack of faith in the report, and Labor's pledge of support all point to bespoke stadium legislation.\n\nRockliff seeks advice on bypassing planning commission for stadium project Photo shows Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff in parliament. After the release of a scathing draft report on Hobart's proposed stadium from Tasmania's planning commission, Premier Jeremy Rockliff confirms he is seeking advice on bypassing the current assessment process.\n\nAt this stage, it appears not to be a matter of if the government goes down that route, but when.\n\nThere are rumours the legislation is more advanced than the government is publicly letting on, but parliament has just wrapped up and is on another one of its many breaks for the year.\n\nGiven the POSS process would've resulted in a September vote, it is pretty safe to assume that if the government is going to embrace the more controversial track, it'll be aiming for something much sooner.\n\nA strong case can certainly be made for May. If it's ready.\n\nThe lower house will sit again on Tuesday May 6. Being the institution of many rules that it is, legislation needs to \"sit\" for two days. Meaning the soonest it could possibly be debated would be Thursday May 8.\n\nThe next option is less appealing, landing the government right in budget week.\n\nThe parliament will be busy and reporters will be focused on the state's finances.\n\nBut stranger things have happened. The federal Labor government certainly didn't shy away from amending the nation's environment laws during the budget week just gone.\n\nIndependent review finds new Hobart stadium costs to 'exceed $1 billion' Photo shows A concept image of the proposed Hobart stadium at Macquarie Poi nt. A leading independent economist tasked with reviewing Tasmania's proposal to build an AFL stadium on Hobart's waterfront finds the project is \"already displaying the hallmarks of mismanagement\" and is likely to exceed $1 billion.\n\nA cynical argument could be made that this timing would suit the Tasmanian government, with the budget being the main story of the day, the legislation might just slip through.\n\nAlthough that seems unlikely.\n\nThe later in the year it gets, the more pointless bespoke legislation will be.\n\nBut with the legislation appearing imminent, there are still so many questions.\n\nLike what will it look like? Will there be conditions on it given the many issues flagged by the interim report? Who ensures those issues are dealt with once it's approved? How can the public's views be taken into account when the process is so rushed and pre-determined?\n\nAnd there's a key question the government is still likely asking itself.\n\nWill its plan even work?\n\nWhile Labor's unconditional support will mean it will soar through the Lower House, the Upper House might not prove to be such an easy goal \u2014 the government needs two independents on side to get through.\n\nAnd if Tuesday's late night debate was anything to go by, it seems that up there, process still matters to some.",

    "text": "Australian tennis royalty has made majestic progress on the Court des Princes with both Alex de Minaur and Alexei Popyrin taking big-name scalps on the way to reaching the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo Masters.\n\nFollowing each other on to the number two court at Monaco's Country Club on Thursday, Popyrin first saved two match points en route to outstaying world number seven Caper Ruud 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 before de Minaur raised eyebrows through the ease with which he demolished old foe Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 6-2.\n\nIt set up the rare treat for Australian tennis of having two players in the quarterfinals of a clay-court Masters 1000 event, with the tantalising prospect of further progress for the Sydneysider pals with de Minaur facing Grigor Dimitrov and Popyrin up against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in Friday's last-eight ties.\n\nAfter a horror start to his season, Popyrin feels like he is starting his tennis year all over again as he earned his best victory of 2025 over Ruud.\n\nA year after he knocked out the then world number six Andrey Rublev at Monaco's prestigious Country Club, the beanpole Australian this time accounted for another big name at his most successful European clay court venue in a draining, near three-hour tussle.\n\nTwice, Popyrin was a point away from bowing out when 5-3 down in the deciding set, before he rallied and went on the attack against Norway's three-time grand slam finalist, reeling off the final four games for one of the best clay court triumphs of his career.\n\nIt also put a dreadful start to his year behind Popyrin, who had only won two matches before turning up in the Principality for his first outing of the clay court season.\n\n\"No, I'm 3 and 0 this year \u2014 I'm forgetting about the start of the year for me,\" the 25-year-old said when asked about his dismal opening to 2025.\n\n\"It was a tough start of the year but this week is a new week, and the year is really, really long, and I just have to put in the work and forget about the last couple of months \u2014 and that's what I've done this week.\"\n\nThe two-hour 56-minute win over Ruud, sealed by a cross-court volley which was his 49th winner of the match, set up a clash with Davidovich Fokina, who also pulled off a shock by defeating British fifth seed Jack Draper 6-3, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4.\n\nEighth seed De Minaur said he was now really finding his feet on clay after trouncing an out-of-sorts world number 11 Medvedev by earning seven breaks of serve in a one-sided affair lasting only 72 minutes.\n\nHe said he had taken confidence from how he had beaten Russia's US Open champ at Roland Garros last year.\n\n\"I thought I executed really well, just had a slight lapse in concentration. But apart from that, I thought I was very smart and tactically played the right way,\" said de Minaur, who will play 15th seed Dimitrov, a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 victor over Novak Djokovic's Chilean conqueror Alejandro Tabilo.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the second seed, beat German qualifier Daniel Altmaier 6-3, 6-1 and will face rising French star Arthur Fils, while de Minaur's old nemesis Stefanos Tsitsipas looked in ominously good form with his 6-1, 6-1 win over Nuno Borges.\n\nThe Greek sixth seed will play Lorenzo Musetti, who won the all-Italian showdown with Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3, in the last-eight.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "\"Are you with me?\"\n\nThere's an unspoken pact made at the start of Circus Oz's latest show, Non Stop, on at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival after a sold-out 2023 season.\n\n\"We're all in it together from the start, sharing the same experience,\" director Nicci Wilks says.\n\nWhile most audiences are passive, Non Stop is devised as more of a two-way conversation.\n\nYou'll see plenty of trapeze performers but never animals at Circus Oz; the company was one of the first to celebrate the human form only. (Supplied: Ian Sutherland)\n\n\"You're aware of this feeling that's being given to you [by audiences], just as much you're giving it to them,\" says Leo Pentland, who performs in the show and has worked with Circus Oz for three years.\n\n\" You feel that tension instantly. You instantly have the audience on your side. \"\n\nWhen he reveals mid-performance, for example, that \u2014 while he's hanging from a considerable height \u2014 the only thing supporting his body is something he's holding between his teeth, he can feel the audience engaging \"that little bit further\".\n\nCircus Oz performer Leo Pentland in training. In the lead-up to a show, performers train for hours each day. (Supplied)\n\nOr when a performer does a handstand on top of 10 stacked chairs, he says it \"gets an almost visceral response\".\n\n\"That's the really powerful thing about circus.\"\n\nPentland calls it a \"beautiful feeling of absolute unease\" \u2014 and Circus Oz has been cultivating it for decades.\n\nAvoiding, not chasing, risk\n\nWilks grew up in the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, Australia's national youth circus \u2014 and our only full-time circus school \u2014 where Circus Oz performers would visit and open up their tent to students to have a taste of professional circus performing.\n\nWilks is a seasoned theatre-maker and performer, but says creating circus requires the process to be slowed right down. (Supplied)\n\nCircus Oz is a trailblazer in Australian physical theatre and, since it was founded in 1977, the company has been responsible for showcasing our circus to the world.\n\nWilks says, given its prominence in her life and its incredibly rich history, directing her own Circus Oz show evoked a mix of feelings.\n\n\"It's exhilarating. Wonderful. Scary,\" she says.\n\nThey feel like words that could equally be applied to the show she's now directing.\n\nIn Non Stop, one stunt is performed by 65-year-old renowned circus performer Debra Batton, who is bringing back an \"old-school special\", disconcertingly named \"dive of death\".\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"It's [an] incredible stunt,\" Wilks says.\n\nAnd though she assures that circus performers are \"the best risk-takers\" (or, as Pentland puts it, \"we respect risk\"), things can, and sometimes do, go wrong.\n\n\"We had someone snap their Achilles in WA,\" Wilks says. Though the performer told her it was an old injury.\n\nBoth Wilks and Pentland say there's a misconception that circus performers are adrenalin-chasing risk-lovers.\n\n\"What you see on stage is really just the final product of a lot of risk aversion, I would say,\" Pentland says.\n\n\"Circus people are probably the safest out there, because you understand the risks and you never take them for granted.\"\n\nDevising a performance that mitigates risk is a slow and precise art form.\n\nCircus Oz comedy can reach differently aged audience members, in different ways, at the same time. (Supplied: Ian Sutherland)\n\n\"Making circus is very different [from other performance],\" Wilks says.\n\n\"Because you've got all these bodies and brains working together that haven't necessarily worked together before, doing dangerous things with each other, trying to work out each other's idiosyncrasies and fears or determination or courage and what are they willing to try, or what are they not.\"\n\n\"People think that we get off on the whole adrenaline nature of it ... [but] I would say that circus people are probably some of the safest out there,\" Pentland says. (Supplied: Ian Sutherland)\n\nAmid all the rough and tumble moments, the slapstick, standing on top of each other and \"slapping each other around\", Pentland believes the care performers have for one another is clear to the audience.\n\n\"It's not just solo act after solo act. We all work together.\"\n\nCircus not going anywhere\n\nWhile that may be true on stage, it hasn't always been so true of the administration.\n\nCircus Oz hit trouble in the lead-up to 2021 when, after more than four decades of operation, disagreement peaked between circus members and funding partners.\n\nAt the time, Jo Caust, associate professor at the University of Melbourne's School of Culture and Communication, said the impact on the performing arts sector would be devastating.\n\n\"Circus Oz showed the world Australia was unique, Australians were capable of doing incredible things, and they had something special to offer on the world stage,\" she wrote.\n\nBut, at the final hour, Circus Oz announced that, thankfully, it had found a way to continue operating, albeit on a smaller scale.\n\nNonetheless, soon after, in 2023, when funding was threatened for the National Institute of Circus Arts (NICA) \u2014 a central part of the Australian circus ecosystem \u2014 circus veteran Anni Davey said, \"It feels like circus ... is under attack.\"\n\nTwo years on, both Circus Oz and NICA (after receiving 2024 funding) still stand \u2014 and Pentland is feeling confident about his sector.\n\nBoth Circus Oz, and circus in general, are making a comeback, he says.\n\n\"It's only getting better and better, and [there are] tours and consistency.\"\n\nCircus is a \"rapidly growing industry\" in Australia, Wilks says, pointing to a proliferation of small independent circus companies.\n\nA 'pinch-yourself moment'\n\nAnother persisting misconception is that circus is somehow a lesser art form \u2014 or not even an art form at all. Indeed, in Melbourne's performing arts awards, the Green Rooms, there is no category for circus performance.\n\nNon Stop, however, shakes off any stigma that might be attached to it. The show is \"relentless \u2026 It doesn't fade\", Pentland says.\n\n\"It's fierce, joyous fun.\"\n\nAnd Pentland is proud of the show's multi-generational cast, with members aged from their mid-20s to their mid-60s.\n\nAt 65, veteran performer Debra Batten is as bold a circus star as ever. (Supplied: Ian Sutherland)\n\n\"You aren't just seeing young bodies on stage [like] you'd expect. It's across a whole generation of performers \u2014 we have a member who used to teach me, so to share the stage with her now is an absolute privilege and delight,\" he says.\n\nBeing able to perform with Circus Oz \u2014 a company that he says \"has been such a pioneer, and given circus the credit it deserves\" \u2014 is also a huge privilege for Pentland.\n\n\"It's still sort of that pinch-yourself moment when you get into rehearsals and go, 'I get to be a part of this amazing space.'\"\n\nNon Stop is at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival from April 16\u201320, then tours regional Victoria (Karalyka, Shepparton and Bendigo) in July and New York City in December.",

    "text": "Anyone associated with Essendon should be disappointed. Frustrated. Angry. Essendon have talked the talk, sometimes even walked the walk, but all too briefly. Too often they have been flaky or flawed \u2013 not qualities we or they would associate with great Essendon teams of the past. Brad Scott was uncompromising as a player and is trying to get Essendon to play with a hard edge. Credit: AFL Photos The Bombers have lacked steel, strength, and conviction and that needs to change. Success is earned through hard work and commitment, through proper strategy and execution. Essendon does have a strategy; they have started a three-year plan. Brad Scott knows what success looks like \u2013 as a player at Brisbane he was part of one of the greatest teams in AFL history. His coach, Leigh Matthews, is one of game\u2019s most pre-eminent figures. Both are strong, both unyielding.\n\nBut the Bombers\u2019 three-year plan should be part of a six to eight-year plan that incorporates the arrival of Tasmania into the competition. A plan that builds upon their recent primary focus on the draft. Essendon have had 12 picks inside the first two rounds of the AFL National Draft since 2020. They have another four selections in the first two rounds this year. That position assumes even greater significance when considering the limited access to early draft\n\nselections caused by forthcoming concessions for the Tassie Devils. Like Richmond, Essendon have made the right decision to attack the draft now. Those who hesitate will suffer \u2013 like the clubs that didn\u2019t suitably plan for recruiting concessions granted to Gold Coast\n\nand GWS from 2009-2012. Such decisions were pivotal to Hawthorn assembling a player list to compete in four consecutive grand finals from 2012-2015.\n\nEssendon\u2019s strategy should be reviewed, analysed, executed then reviewed again. Its development isn\u2019t linear. It requires careful planning, periodical change and honest appraisal. No individual coach, staff member or executive can be allowed to hijack the process \u2013 some disagreement is expected, even encouraged, but it\u2019s critical that the coaching, player development, high performance and list management teams are aligned. The Bombers have young talent. With the fourth-youngest list in 2025, their age demographic is skewed towards the future. They are not starting another re-build, that undertaking was initiated\n\nmore than five years ago. Twenty list changes in the past two years have only accelerated the program. But it\u2019s essential they don\u2019t look at their players through a biased lens \u2013 coaches and recruiters often favour their preferred players when success demands the same standards apply to everyone.\n\nThey have the nucleus of a successful team \u2013 Andrew McGrath and Jordan Ridley in defence, Zach Merrett, Jye Caldwell and Sam Durham in the midfield plus Kyle Langford and Nate Caddy in attack provide a solid foundation for the future. But there are still too many players who show potential rather than consistent talent. Good one week, poor the next. Willing to follow rather than lead. Satisfied with playing at AFL level over being the best. Neither unflinching, uncompromising or unconditional. Zach Merrett leads Essendon onto the MCG. Credit: Getty Images More players need to become like their captain and coach \u2013 tough and relentless \u2013 strong leaders who view team success as their legacy. While 2025 is an important step along the way, Essendon must keep their focus on the bigger picture \u2013 they simply don\u2019t have the right personnel to win a premiership just yet.\n\nSo where to from here? Two statistics from 2025 clearly point to immediate needs. First, kicking efficiency \u2013 ranked 16th in the competition. Second, hard ball gets \u2013 also ranked 16th. Zak Butters will be a restricted free agent in 2026, and is the type of elite player Essendon should look to recruit. Credit: Getty Images Both statistics have been integral to premiership teams over the past 20 years, so ignore them at\n\nyour peril. The Bombers need players who can hurt the opposition by foot and/or win contested\n\npossession under pressure. And players who can break lines with their disposal. Essendon have high draft selections to work a trade for specific players in 2025 \u2013 they should firmly set their sights on Zak Butters (Port Adelaide) and Harley Reid (West Coast) if they can be convinced to return to Victoria.\n\nTheir early draft picks should only be expended to secure players of this calibre or to maximise their\n\ndraft position in 2025-26. Loading The draft is likely to be compromised by the Tassie Devils from 2027 so recruiting the best available young players now is of even more importance. While 2025 does not offer the same depth of talent as last year, the draft window is closing, so selection value is going to become greater over the next two years. Similarly, the Bombers should look to trade players who don\u2019t form part of their premiership model.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean releasing players at any cost but being prepared to take a step back to go forward\n\nin the longer term. These choices are sometimes contentious, but it is often the difficult decisions\n\nthat bring the biggest rewards. Players to consider:\n\nSam Draper As a free agent in 2025, Essendon should look to move him to improve their draft currency via AFL compensation or initiate a trade to a club offering the most favourable return. Essendon could be richly rewarded if they were willing to offload Sam Draper. Credit: AFL Photos Nik Cox v Harrison Jones Both players possess ability but have struggled with injury. With multiple \u201ctalls\u201d on the list, they will compete for a position in the same team. Retain one, move the other.\n\nDarcy Parish Loading Has been unlucky with injury but the development of Caldwell and Durham means he is better served at a club competing for a premiership in the short term. Peter Wright While he adds depth to their forward line, the Bombers should look to trade him while he still has limited currency. Not part of their premiership model.",

    "text": "The findings, while devastating, did not come as a shock to the Iskanders. \u201cWhen it is your first pregnancy, you leave your care in the hands of experts. You trust them,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cBut from day one we received very mixed and confusing messages from the hospital.\u201d The Iskanders and Mia in hospital after the delivery. The couple remember being told Danielle required an emergency cesarean, but rather than being rushed to the operating theatre, all they remember is waiting. \u201cWe weren\u2019t too stressed because we thought obviously if it was an emergency, they would rush me into surgery,\u201d Danielle said.\n\nThe first inclination that something was seriously wrong would come when Stephen was sitting outside the operating theatre waiting to be brought in to hold his newborn daughter, and he heard a message blare over the PA system. \u201cThey were calling a neonatal code blue,\u201d Stephen said, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cI\u2019m seeing people running in, but nobody is telling me what\u2019s going on.\u201d The hours that followed Mia\u2019s birth are a blur. They remember seeing Mia in a knitted beanie, wrapped in a blanket, with wires all over her tiny body, and taking photos of her to send to their family. The couple said they were not told the severity of the situation until an infant emergency team arrived to take the critically ill Mia to another hospital. \u201cWhen they told us to prepare for the worst and say goodbye to Mia, we were just completely blindsided,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cThere are no words to explain that moment.\u201d\n\nMia died less than eight hours after she was born. An independent expert, senior obstetric clinician Jeremy Chin, examined the case and found Mia\u2019s heart rate should have been treated as a red flag for \u201csignificant fetal compromise\u201d that required immediate management. However, Chin found that while a quicker delivery may have seen Mia delivered in a less severe state of oxygen deprivation, she was suffering from a perinatal infection that was \u201cultimately overwhelming\u201d. Danielle had been previously hospitalised and was receiving ongoing antibiotic treatment for a bacterial infection, which had progressed to an infection in the baby. The coroner found Danielle\u2019s treatment by the hospital before the day of Mia\u2019s delivery was reasonable and appropriate.\n\nThe official cause of Mia\u2019s death was found to be complications of a uterine infection in the setting of premature pre-labour rupture of membranes. Northern Health management declined to comment when contacted by The Age. \u201cAs this matter is currently before the courts, we are unable to comment at this time,\u201d a spokesperson said. The Iskanders said they were speaking out to prevent their tragedy from happening to another family. They also said a lack of mental health care and lack of support shown by the hospital after the ordeal further traumatised them.\n\nLoading \u201cWe were just left to deal with it all on our own,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cEvery time we called the hospital they were like \u2018why are you calling us? You\u2019ve already had your baby?\u2019 We would have to explain, yes, I had the baby, but the baby died.\u201d They called for reform in the healthcare system after several other deaths of babies and children in Victorian hospitals. On July 1, last year, they gave birth to another daughter, Maddison.\n\n\u201cIt was bittersweet,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cWe were so happy, but there is still so much grief about Mia.\u201d Mia\u2019s death is one of a number of hospital deaths of young children or babies being investigated by Victorian coroners. Last year, an inquest into the death of a 19-month-old Victorian toddler Noah Souvatzis in 2021 found his death was preventable. Noah died on December 30, 2021, from meningitis. The coroner found that the toddler was discharged after an inadequate review by an under-trained, junior locum doctor on his first shift. Latrobe Regional Hospital is also facing calls for an independent inquiry after it was revealed several patients, including infants, had died or experienced serious harm.",

Asked about the next steps for Guardian Australia, Taylor reaffirms a company policy not to discuss operational matters or anything related to the recent events in Canberra. Yet, in the 12 months since Murphy left, arguably, things in Canberra could not have gone worse. They included an independent HR investigation into claims and counterclaims within the team and a swift exodus of talent. (Four of its most senior reporters and its veteran photographer have left.)\n\nSix months after Middleton started as political editor, she filed an informal complaint against the company\u2019s long-standing chief political correspondent, Paul Karp, who responded with a counter-complaint of bullying.\n\nTaylor was kept at arm\u2019s length, considering she and Middleton were close friends of 35 years, having been cadets together at The Canberra Times and were former housemates. Former editor-in-chief of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger. Credit: Paul Morigi The investigation involved interviews with Karp, Middleton and other staff, and delivered its findings in December. All involved were bound by strict confidentiality agreements. The investigation found Middleton\u2019s bullying allegation against Karp could not be substantiated. Karp resigned soon after, and Middleton went on leave, where she remained until March when she and the organisation agreed on her exit. (In that tumultuous period, blogger and reporter Amy Remeikis joined the think tank, the Australia Institute, reporter Daniel Hurst moved to communications, and photographer Mike Bowers also departed.) It was a major decision to part ways with one of the most experienced press gallery journalists and biographer of the prime minister on the eve of a federal election, with incoming chief political correspondent Tom McIlroy to join only days before polling day.\n\nLoading Middleton and Karp did not respond to a series of questions. The situation punctuates a growing sentiment among journalists, many former and some current staff, that The Guardian has reached a point of maturity in Australia. It has succeeded where other international interlopers, such as BuzzFeed and HuffPost, have failed in breaking into Australia\u2019s media establishment, but now, it is no longer the punchy upstart it was 12 years ago, for better or worse. Part of the early success matched experienced editors from The Guardian\u2019s UK office with big-name local hires, says Rusbridger. It was a delicate balance between being the outsider and the disruptor, he says, but names such as Murphy and Taylor, alongside up-and-coming talent, helped, too. \u201cThat helped reassure readers it wasn\u2019t some external transplant; it wasn\u2019t outsiders parachuted in, it was people who had a local perspective.\u201d\n\nSome have argued the exit of major characters associated with the brand (Turnbull still refers to Murphy as \u201cMurpharoo\u201d, for example) over a sustained period has led to a loss of its once-renowned edge, a contention Taylor doesn\u2019t buy into. Loading \u201cI think we\u2019re growing a whole new generation of fantastic names for Australians,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI think it would be really arrogant for a senior journalist to say, \u2018no one will ever be a name like I was, or like my successor was\u2019. We\u2019ve got a whole new generation of fantastic journalists who are names already or who are going to be names.\u201d Taylor\u2019s confidence is backed up by several indicators of success. She is particularly pleased she proved former Fairfax boss Greg Hywood wrong when he told her on her departure there would only ever be two recognised news brands in Australia, alongside News Corp. Guardian Australia, which is published digitally in Australia, is one of the country\u2019s top-read outlets, with a monthly audience of between 7 million and 8 million Australians. Its audience grew 9 per cent over the past two years, according to the February figures from ratings agency Ipsos, but was outpaced by international publishers The New York Times (up 12 per cent) and the BBC (29 per cent) across the same period. Albeit, those had more room for growth.\n\nIn 2024, Guardian Australia made a modest $1.3 million in profit, yet this isn\u2019t a top priority for the not-for-profit trustee ownership. It remains free to access, urging its readers to pay on a voluntary basis, and has significantly grown its newsrooms and areas of coverage, Taylor says. \u201cIt is true, we\u2019re bigger and much more influential now, and I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cBeing a start-up is exciting, but there\u2019s not really anything romantic about trying to cover all the news in an ongoing way with a handful of reporters.\u201d Former Guardian Australia journalists Karen Middleton and Paul Karp. One criticism levelled by current and former staff is a legendarily low appetite for legally tricky stories which, they say, means it has lost some of its bite over the years. It\u2019s a contention Taylor, unsurprisingly, disagrees with. \u201cI think we are still breaking a lot of news. We still do hard-hitting analysis and opinion, and we\u2019ve added a lot of investigative clout to that as well,\u201d Taylor says.\n\n\u201cI think any publisher in Australia is aware of how our defamation laws work, so you need to be calculated and deliberate in the risks that you take, but we\u2019re not shy of taking risks if the story is in the public interest and worth it.\u201d Despite the commentary and exits, there is no need to reinvent the wheel or the mindset at Guardian Australia, says Taylor. Loading \u201cI think we are still distinctive in the same way that we were then, in that we are progressive. We look at the world through a progressive lens. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re partisan. We always follow the facts, but we look at things with the view that Australia and the world can change to be better and fairer. \u201cThe sort of essence of The Guardian is here as it\u2019s always been.\u201d\n\nOne senior News Corp editor, who requested anonymity to comment freely, affirms the outlet as a \u201cprofessional\u201d news outfit. \u201cBut the point to make is that all media organisations today define themselves and their business model according to a political slant.\u201d This applies to both The Guardian and The Australian, they say, which has led to an increasingly polarised electorate. \u201cMedia organisations don\u2019t want to admit that. It\u2019d be helpful if they did.\u201d Taylor\u2019s own role as editor has been the subject of speculation for some time, given she is now Australia\u2019s longest-serving editor after The Australian Financial Review\u2019s Michael Stutchbury stood down in mid-2024. Staff constantly speculate she is in line for a move to the UK head office or to take up an editorial role at the ABC, neither of which are happening, Taylor says.",

They\u2019re 14th in the Premier League with 16 defeats in 31 games so far, the most they\u2019ve suffered in a single campaign for more than two decades.\n\nAngeball is not dead. Not yet. Worst-case scenario, this project has exactly one week to live, assuming we believe the talk that Postecoglou\u2019s future in North London depends entirely upon winning the Europa League.\n\nThe English media might be openly speculating about Ange Postecoglou\u2019s replacement, and it might be that at least half of the Tottenham Hotspur fanbase is counting down the seconds until the club posts a generic social media graphic and the words \u2018Club Statement: Ange Postecoglou\u2019 on its official channels, and there might be a priest in the room, holding a bible, ready to go - but there is still a pulse.\n\nInjuries explain it - at one stage they were missing a dozen key first-team players, and had zero centre-backs available for weeks on end - but only to a point. All their big stars have returned over the past few weeks, but they have generally stunk it up. Patience has run out, and something resembling psychological warfare has broken out between the manager and the supporters.\n\nThere have been shades of 2017 about Postecoglou\u2019s prickly demeanour of late. That was his last year with the Socceroos, when he walked out on the Australian game just six months before the World Cup, having realised he alone couldn\u2019t \u2018fix\u2019 it. He admitted he had become worn down and didn\u2019t like who he\u2019d become.\n\nAnge Postecoglou - celebrating, not praying. Credit: Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s a bit similar now. He doesn\u2019t look happy. His contempt for certain journalists in the Spurs press pack is no longer concealed, and he can\u2019t help but snap back at the fans who taunt him during and after games. Last week, after the away fans at Chelsea chanted \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d when he took off Lucas Bergvall for Pape Matar Sarr, he cupped his ears in their general direction when Sarr scored shortly afterwards. The goal was then disallowed. He tried to explain later that he just wanted to hear the fans supporting the team, but nobody believed him.\n\nIt was, as they say, Spursy behaviour. He\u2019s supposed to be the antidote, but it\u2019s infecting him.",

Matt O\u2019Donohue Previous Slide Next Slide Good Food hat 15.5 / 20 How we score Mexican$$$$ Consider, for a moment, the evolution of the wine bar in Australia. Previously\n\navailable in just four flavours \u2013 French, Italian and Spanish, plus a broadly\n\n\u201cEuropean\u201d catch-all \u2013 wine bars have significantly broadened their horizons over the past decade. In Melbourne, there\u2019s Manze: a Mauritian wine bar that taps into the diverse island heritage of co-owner Nagesh Seethiah. The enduring popularity of Brisbane\u2019s Snack Man, meanwhile, is a reminder that lo-fi wines can do things for Asian food that tea can only dream of. (See also the Taiwanese-inspired cooking at Muni in McLaren Vale, South Australia: one of my standout meals of 2024.) Following the recent discovery of a maverick inner-city wine bar serving bold, brilliant Mexican cookery, Perth has entered the genre\u2019s DEI chat. Sort of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew-era Mexican cooking for the discerning (wine) drinker. Matt O\u2019Donohue I say sort-of because the food at Casa, the Mount Hawthorn wine bar in question,\n\ndoesn\u2019t just hang its hat on cocina Mexicana. Italy, for one, forms a healthy chunk of its playbook: think thick shoelaces of tonnarelli pasta and tiny mopheads of crab meat bound in a lurid jalapeno butter. Toast graffitied with fat squiggles of chicken liver parfait is typical of the bistro cooking that might appear while the menu occasionally dabbles in retro throwbacks (hello prawn cocktail lettuce cups). I also say sort-of because, according to Casa chef Paul Bentley, his cooking isn\u2019t\n\nwhat he\u2019d describe as Mexican food. Or at least Mexican food made by someone\n\nwith an intrinsic understanding of the cuisine and culture. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with an abuela [grandmother] cooking birria [a classic Mexican goat stew] on the weekends,\u201d says Bentley. What our man did do, though, was spend a decade working in Mexico where, among other things, he opened Magno Brasserie \u2013 a distillation of everything he learned under legendary Perth chef Alain Fabregues at The Loose Box and Daniel Boulud of New York\u2019s French powerhouse Daniel \u2013 operated ramen bars, plus ran a string of bakeries. (So that\u2019s why Casa\u2019s pillowy focaccia and the dough at its pizzeria spin-off are both so good! The peso drops.) The other thing Bentley did in Mexico was eat plenty of Mexican food, from the fancy to the street. So much so that when COVID lockdowns stranded our man in Perth, he brought his understanding of spice and acidity to the food he was cooking at Si Paradiso \u2013 the tepache (fermented pineapple juice) he\u2019d slip onto pizzas, say \u2013 as well as Scarborough\u2019s goodtime beachside cantina, El Grotto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when Bentley and fellow Casa partners Cale Mason and Sydney-based chef\n\nEnrico Tomelleri of Darlinghurst\u2019s magnetic Paski Sopra opened Casa in 2021, it felt inevitable that Mexican influences would seep into that menu too. That octopus would be cooked al pastor taco style and laid across toast. (No longer on the menu, alas.) That a herbal Mayan-influenced pumpkin seed dip would partner said focaccia, and that those pepitas would also be turned into a salsa for grilled cabbage, charry from the grill. Both, thankfully, are still on the menu, as are more recent creations a la skewers of juicy lamb rump brightened by a sauce bright with barbacoa spice. A new kind of wine bar. Matt O\u2019Donohue But for the new-new stuff, it\u2019s all about the $79 chef\u2019s menu. Once an outlet for\n\nBentley\u2019s classically minded French cooking, the set-course option is now a four-\n\nstage meal comprised largely of off-menu items sporting a strong Mexican flavour. Sometimes the influence is subtle: the zip of pickled cactus in the flank steak tartare, maybe, or casting crunchy tostadas as ideal vehicles for highlighting the silken pleasures of pristine cured bonito.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther times though, the accent comes through loud and clear. That would be the\n\nbrooding mole poblano \u2013 a rich, slow-cooked fantasy of dark chocolate, dried fruit and a supermarket aisle\u2019s worth of spice \u2013 pooled underfoot rosy, dry-aged Wagin duck breast. The bird\u2019s legs, meanwhile, form the filling for dainty flautas: rolled-up, fried tacos that are even more fun to eat than they sound. (The tortillas for the flautas and tostada, incidentally, are made locally by the nixtamalized corn whisperers at La Tortilla.) Good Food hat 15.5 / 20 Review This French bistro is a masterclass in knowing when to follow and when to flout the rules For anyone that\u2019s been stung by tasting menus that feel lazy, underdone or\n\noffer questionable bang-for-buck, Casa\u2019s offering may help restore your faith in the format. Not that committing to a (somewhat restaurant-y) menu is mandatory for enjoying yourself here. Like any self-respecting wine bar, Casa has a welcoming, third-place charm that makes it feel like an extension of home, even if those rendered walls, mid-century accents and finely tuned speakers make it feel like the living room of an especially well-designed holiday home in Milan. You can push the boat out, even on a weeknight, or drop in a bowl of chips with green Goddess sauce or a scoop of pistachio gelato: switched-on and engaged staff will make you feel welcome, regardless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Casa isn\u2019t the first place to have thought of serving tacos alongside vino. While not explicitly wine bars, establishments such as El Publico and La Cholita helped expose Perth eaters to Mexican food-and-drink matches beyond Coronas and bottles of tequila with worms in them. The joys of eating jarred salsa and packet corn chips on the couch are near universal, not least with bottles of juicy pinot noir, Yellowglen and the remote in easy reach. Thanks to the ubiquitousness of Old El Paso et al, you and I can enjoy such Tex-Mex pleasures without having to leave the house. But for Mexican-ish cooking of a higher calibre \u2013 and plenty more besides \u2013\n\nwe\u2019ll have to go to Casa.

    "text": "The Trump administration has announced a 90-day pause on its plan to impose so-called 'reciprocal' tariffs on nearly all US imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the pause does not extend to China, where import duties will rise to around 125 per cent, on top of an existing 20 per cent tariff that is already in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move signals a partial retreat from what had been shaping up as a broad and aggressive trade war.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most countries, the US will now apply a 10 per cent baseline tariff for the next three months.\n\n\n\nBut the White House made clear that its tariffs on Chinese imports will remain in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why did President Trump back away from the broader tariff push?\n\n\n\nThe answer is simple: the economic cost to the US was too high.\n\n\n\nModelling the fallout\n\nUsing a global economic model, we have been estimating the macroeconomic consequences of the Trump administration's tariff plans as they have developed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table shows two versions of the economic effects of the tariff plan:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. 'pre-pause' \u2013 as the plan stood immediately before Wednesday's 90-day pause, under a scenario in which all countries retaliate except Australia, Japan, and South Korea (which said they would not retaliate)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. 'post-pause' - after reciprocal tariffs were withdrawn.\n\n\n\nSource: The Conversation As is clear, the US would have faced steep and immediate losses in employment, investment, growth, and most importantly, real consumption, the best measure of household living standards.\n\n\n\nHeavy costs of the tariff war\n\nUnder the pre-pause scenario, the US would have seen real consumption fall by 2.4 per cent in 2025 alone. Real gross domestic product (GDP) would have declined by 2.6 per cent, while employment falls by 2.7 per cent and real investment (after inflation) plunges 6.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are not trivial adjustments. They represent significant contractions that would be felt in everyday life, from job losses to price increases to reduced household purchasing power. Since the current US unemployment rate is 4.2 per cent, these results suggest that for every three currently unemployed Americans, two more would join their ranks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur modelling shows the damage would not just be short-term. Across the 2025\u20132040 projection period, US real consumption losses would have averaged 1.2 per cent, with persistent investment weakness and a long-term decline in real GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is likely that internal economic advice reflected this kind of outlook. The decision to pause most of the tariff increases may well be an acknowledgement that the policy was economically unsustainable and would result in a permanent reduction in US global economic power. Financial markets were also rattled.\n\n\n\nThe scaled-back plan: still aggressive on China\n\nThe new arrangement announced on 9 April scales the higher tariff regime back to a flat 10 per cent for about 70 countries, but keeps the full weight of tariffs on Chinese goods at around 145 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nRates on Canadian and Mexican imports remain at 25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, China has announced an 84 per cent tariff on US goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table's 'post-pause' column summarises the results of the scaled-back plan if the pause becomes permanent. For consistency, we assume all countries except Australia, Japan and Korea retaliate with tariffs equal to those imposed by the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs is clear from the 'post-pause' results, lower US tariffs, together with lower retaliatory tariffs, equal less damage for the US economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTariffs applied uniformly are less distortionary, and significant retaliation from just one major partner (China) is easier to absorb than a broad global response.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the costs will still be high. The US is projected to experience a 1.9 per cent drop in real consumption in 2025, driven by lower employment and reduced efficiency in production. Real investment is projected to fall by 4.8 per cent, and employment by 2.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps we should not be surprised that the costs are still so high. In 2022, China, Canada and Mexico accounted for almost 45 per cent of all US goods imports, and many countries were already facing 10 per cent reciprocal tariffs in the 'pre-pause' scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's tariff pause has not changed duty rates for these countries.\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean for Australia?\n\nMuch of the domestic commentary in Australia has focused on the risk of collateral damage from a US-China trade war. Given Australia's economic ties to both countries, it is a reasonable concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut our modelling suggests that Australia may actually benefit modestly. Under both scenarios, Australia's real consumption rises slightly, driven by stronger investment, improved terms of trade (a measure of our export prices relative to import prices), and redirection of trade flows.\n\n\n\nOne mechanism is what economists call trade diversion: if Chinese or European exporters find the US market less attractive, they may redirect goods to Australia and other open markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, reduced global demand for capital, especially in the US and China, means lower interest rates globally. That stimulates investment elsewhere, including in Australia. In our model, Australian real investment rises under both scenarios, leading to small but sustained gains in GDP and household consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results suggest that, at least under current policy settings, Australia is unlikely to suffer significant direct effects from the tariff increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, rising investor uncertainty is a risk for both the global and Australian economies, and this is not factored into our modelling. In the space of a single week, the Trump administration has whipsawed global investor confidence through three major tariff announcements.\n\n\n\nA temporary reprieve\n\nTariffs appear to be central to the administration\u2019s economic program. So Trump\u2019s decision to pause his broader tariff agenda may not signal a shift in philosophy: just a tactical retreat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated strategy, high tariffs on China and lower ones elsewhere, might reflect an attempt to refocus on where the administration sees its main strategic concern, while avoiding unnecessary blowback from allies and neutral partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether this narrower approach proves durable remains to be seen. The sharpest economic pain has been deferred. Whether it returns depends on how the next 90 days play out.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Giesecke is a professor at the Centre of Policy Studies and the Impact Project, Victoria University.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Waschik is associate professor and deputy director at the Centre of Policy Studies, Victoria University.\n\n",

We're not doing this for fun. We are doing this because the planet depends on it and it's a massive economic opportunity for our country. And because some fundamental things don't change. The fundamentals that renewables are the cheapest form of energy, even with the cost of storage, even with the cost of transmission, renewables remain the cheapest form of energy. That's what the science tells me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition is planning to build seven nuclear power stations by the coming decades - and says its policy to incentivise energy producers to reserve more gas for domestic use will reduce household gas bills by 7 per cent and electricity bills by 3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Energy spokesperson Ted O'Brien says the government is failing to engage in big reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe the big problem we've seen over the last three years has been the treatment of regional Australia, in particular, who are carrying the burden of Labor's policies. They've been steamrolled here. And you can't expect communities, let alone the whole country, to come with you when you treat them with reckless indifference.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton has confirmed that any cut to overseas migration under a Coalition government would only be for two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is on track to reduce net overseas migration by 120,000 to 260,000 next financial year according to government figures in the May budget, following Labor's reforms to reduce the migration intake from record post-COVID highs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton has already promised to cut net overseas migration by 100,000 from whatever the current figure is if the Coalition wins office.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday he has clarified the cuts would only be temporary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are going to cut migration numbers so we can increase home ownership in this country. We do it for a two year period then we bring back the numbers but it allows us to create about 100,000 homes , or free up about 100,000 homes, in addition to the $5 billion plan that we've outlined which will create about 500,00 homes. That's a serious housing policy and it will help get Aussie kids into Australian homes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli aircraft have struck a residential block in northern Gaza killing at least 23 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hamas-run Health Ministry says eight children are among the dead after the strike hit a four-story building in the Shijaiyah neighbourhood of Gaza City.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military says it struck a senior Hamas militant who was behind attacks from the area but didn't name him or provide further details.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael has blamed the deaths of Palestinian civilians on the militant group, saying it embeds itself in dense urban areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nA key member of the Trump administration has denied the President's decision to pause sweeping new tariffs is motivated by falling global stockmarkets.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says the decision is designed to give other countries time to negotiate with the U-S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So how can you be respectful when a country says, 'I want to come and talk, I will do it'? How do you deal with that when you have so many countries that deserve our time and our respect? So he decided he would pause it, start at 10 per cent for everybody, right? And let's go negotiate with all of these great countries and let's see if we can do great deals for America, much better deals for America, but that's the model.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause on his so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on all countries except China who remains subject to a tariff of 125 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nA universal 10 per cent tariff will still apply to all other countries throughout the period.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout one-in-three Australian adults are collectors according to a report by eBay and Deloitte Access Economics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median Australian hobbyist has 50 collectables worth a total of $2200, based on a survey of 2000 collectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpanded to the entire population, the report estimates Australians own about 380 million collectables at a price tag of $16.8 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report says technological, economic and social change over the past 25 years have expanded people's access across the globe - with Australians spending a record of $69 billion on online shopping in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoins are the most popular collectable followed by toys, pre-loved fashion items, and antiques, while trading cards amount to some of the most expensive collectables on eBay.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport and in tennis,\n\n\n\n\n\n24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic has been knocked out of the Monte Carlo Masters with a 6-3, 6-4 loss to Chilean Alejandro Tabilo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defeat has ended the Serbian's quest for a 100th career title for the time being.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians Alex de Minaur and Alexei Popyrin fared better in the first major European clay-court event.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points when its board next meets, National Australia Bank (NAB) predicts, as it forecasts a cash rate of 2.6 per cent by February next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cash rate is currently at 4.10 per cent after the RBA's board made a 0.25 percentage point cut at its February meeting . It will next meet in May after leaving rates on hold in April .\n\n\n\n\n\nNAB's economics team also predicted standard 0.25 percentage point cuts in July, August, and November, stating that a restrictive policy stance from the RBA was \"no longer appropriate\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Auld, NAB chief economist, said: \"Headwinds from the global environment have intensified, but error bounds around our forecast are large given uncertainty remains exceptionally elevated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our call for a 50bps (0.5 percentage points) easing in May reflects the fact that with the real cash rate of 1.3 per cent and policy currently restrictive, the RBA needs to play catch up,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Once the cash rate reaches a level more consistent with a neutral policy setting, we then expect the RBA to pause for a few months before taking the cash rate into modestly accommodative territory.\"\n\n\n\nNAB is predicting a double rate cut in May, with estimations that rates will lower to 2.60 per cent by February 2026. Source: SBS News\n\nCould Trump's tariffs lead to more RBA cuts?\n\nEarlier this month, the RBA left the cash rate unchanged at 4.10 per cent, denying borrowers back-to-back mortgage relief after its first cut since 2020 in February .\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after United States President Donald Trump implemented sweeping global tariffs, markets around the world witnessed their worst trading day since 2020, with trillions wiped off the market .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe economic uncertainty had some experts predicting rate cuts, while Trump's last-minute reversal could reduce the chances of a cut when the RBA meets again in mid-May.\n\n\n\nRBA governor Michele Bullock is expected to speak on Thursday evening for the first time since the economic turmoil.\n\n\n\n\n\nBullock previously noted the central bank was concerned that uncertainty over Trump's tariffs could lead to slower economic growth.\n\n\n\nWhat are other big banks predicting?\n\nANZ : Predicts three more cuts, taking the cash rate to 3.35 per cent by August.\n\nCBA: Predicts a cut each quarter, taking the cash rate to 3.35 per cent by the end of the year.\n\nWestpac: Predicts a cut each quarter, taking the cash rate to 3.35 per cent by the end of the year.\n\nNAB: Predicts five cuts (including a double in May), taking the cash rate to 2.60 per cent by February 2026.\n\nThe rest of the 'big four' banks are predicting the cash rate to reach 3.35 per cent by next February. Source: SBS News\n\nHow much could it save you?\n\nAccording to financial comparison site Canstar, a 0.5 percentage point cut would mean the monthly repayments on a $600,000 mortgage drop by $181.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf NAB's forecast were to come true, with five more cuts through to the first quarter of next year, then the total drop in monthly repayments could be an estimated $526.\n\n\n\nIf NAB's predicted cash rate comes to fruition, some households could save over $300 a month. Source: SBS News\n\n'Difficult' to see a double rate cut\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at Canstar, said while a double rate cut couldn't be ruled out, it was unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A cash rate cut in May is a live option on the back of an evolving global trade war and a double cut, while unlikely, can't be ruled out,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"That said, it's difficult to see the data-driven RBA firing off a double cut when it next meets in May. The highly methodical central bank usually likes to take time to see how volatile events play out in the Australian economy,\" Tindall said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The RBA has previously said it would be hesitant to fire off rate cuts in quick succession; however, the reduction in the number of times the board meets could push it into making decisions earlier than it previously would.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall encouraged Australians to keep a \"calm and level head\" despite rising economic uncertainty.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been a week since Donald Trump upended the global trade system by announcing steep country-specific tariffs as high as 50 per cent for 57 nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut less than 24 hours after they came into effect, he used a post on social media to announce an abrupt reversal in policy: a 90-day pause on those tariffs, with a lower 10 per cent tariff to be applied as negotiations continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement caught people by surprise, including the US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who was in the middle of a hearing [[before the House Ways and Means Committee]], facing questions from Democratic Representative Steven Horsford on the country's trade strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreer: \"I understand it is 90 days. I haven't spoken to the President...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHorsford: \"So the trade representative hasn't spoken to the President of the United States about a global reordering of trade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreer: \"Yes, I have. I have just been in a meeting with you - \"\n\n\n\n\n\nHorsford: \"And yet he (Donald Trump) announced it on a tweet \u2013 WTF, who is in charge?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreer: \"The President of the United States is in charge.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHorsford: \"And what do you know about those details?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreer: \"As I mentioned...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHorsford: \"It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStock markets around the world rallied on the news of the tariff pause, with the S&P 500 posting its best day since October 2008. The Australian sharemarket soared as much as 6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt marks a turn for the better for investors, after the most intense period of financial market volatility in five years, since the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nClient portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, Brian Mulberry says it is a welcome correction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd the best way I can summarise it is just the difference between certainty and uncertainty. When we have maximum tariff pressure for a maximum period of time, the range of outcomes on individual businesses as well as consumers starts to become less certain. That uncertainty creates the wall of worry. Are we in a growth scare? Are we facing a recession? There's so many possible outcomes, the negative sentiment pulls the value of the market down. With a 90-day pause in tariffs, now we only have to deal with basically a 10% baseline tariff. That creates a much more certain outcome in terms of the cost of goods, what trade will look like, and obviously much less of an impact on consumers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter days of insisting he would not be backing down, President Trump admits what's called the market jitters - seen in the sustained volatility on financial markets - did play a big role in his decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople were jumping a little bit out of life. They were getting yippy, afraid. Look, nothing is over yet. But we have a tremendous amount of spirit from other countries including China. China wants to make a deal. They just don't know how quite to go about it. So there is one of those things - they're quite proud people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only country to be excluded from the pause on tariffs is China.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump says the tariff on imported Chinese goods will now be increased by a further 21 per cent - to 125 per cent, saying China has shown a \"lack of respect\" by responding to the US tariffs with a 84 per cent levy on US imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to be able to go under the wall, around the wall - or over the wall. So I think in financial markets - because they change. Look at how much it changed today. It went from pretty moderate today. But over the last few days it looked pretty glum, to I guess, I say it was the biggest day in financial history. That is a pretty big change. And I think the word would be flexible. You have to be flexible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether China will increase its tariffs even further - remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina has taken the toughest approach so far to the US tariffs, but a number of countries are evaluating their own responses and have promised more retaliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union has approved tariffs to hit about A$38 billion (21 billion euros) of US goods in retaliation for the 25 per cent duties imposed by the US last month on the bloc's steel and aluminium exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Trade Organization says trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, the US and China, could lead to a long-term reduction in global real GDP by nearly 7 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also says that could see the trade of goods between the two economies reduce by as much as 80 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says this is not economic warfare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I'm not calling it a trade war. But I am saying that China has escalated. And President Trump has responded very courageously to that. And we are going to work on a solution with our trading partners.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it was Mr Trump's strategy all along to not have the tariffs as announced to be permanent, but rather create the opportunity for new trade negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was driven by the President's strategy. He and I had a long talk on Sunday. And this was his strategy all along. You might even say that he goaded (provoked) China into a bad position. They have responded. They have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actor. And we are willing to co-operate with our allies and with our trading partners who did not retaliate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration says the 90-day pause does not impact tariffs already imposed, such as those on steel and aluminium - and Mr Trump indicated there will be come to come on sectors like pharmaceuticals and lumbar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US tariff situation for Australia remains unchanged by the pause.\n\n\n\n\n\nA so-called baseline 10 per cent tariff came into effect at the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Deputy Prime Minister, Richard Marles, says the federal government is continuing to make the case to be exempt from the tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

What you may not know about the stock market\n\nHowever, a 10 per cent blanket duty on almost all US imports will remain in effect. Australia has not received a lowered tariff thanks to the temporary pause, as it was already set to have a 10 per cent tariff applied.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U-turn is believed to be a response to dislocation in bond markets as yields surged and confidence in US treasuries began to falter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US excluded China from the break and instead increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 125 per cent, after China lifted its impost on US goods to 84 per cent from 34 per cent hours earlier.\n\n\n\nWhat are analysts saying about the rebound?\n\nJessica Amir, market analyst for trading firm Moomoo, said: \"Just like that, US President Donald Trump paused higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days and investors jumped back into stocks, gold and oil, selling out of bonds.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Sycamore, analyst for trading platform IG Markets, said while Trump appeared willing to look through equity market losses, the overnight backflip showed \"the bond market remains the ultimate master of markets and politicians alike by virtue of its role as the 'plumbing' of the financial system\".\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Anyone associated with Essendon should be disappointed. Frustrated. Angry. Essendon have talked the talk, sometimes even walked the walk, but all too briefly. Too often they have been flaky or flawed \u2013 not qualities we or they would associate with great Essendon teams of the past. Brad Scott was uncompromising as a player and is trying to get Essendon to play with a hard edge. Credit: AFL Photos The Bombers have lacked steel, strength, and conviction and that needs to change. Success is earned through hard work and commitment, through proper strategy and execution. Essendon does have a strategy; they have started a three-year plan. Brad Scott knows what success looks like \u2013 as a player at Brisbane he was part of one of the greatest teams in AFL history. His coach, Leigh Matthews, is one of game\u2019s most pre-eminent figures. Both are strong, both unyielding.\n\nBut the Bombers\u2019 three-year plan should be part of a six to eight-year plan that incorporates the arrival of Tasmania into the competition. A plan that builds upon their recent primary focus on the draft. Essendon have had 12 picks inside the first two rounds of the AFL National Draft since 2020. They have another four selections in the first two rounds this year. That position assumes even greater significance when considering the limited access to early draft\n\nselections caused by forthcoming concessions for the Tassie Devils. Like Richmond, Essendon have made the right decision to attack the draft now. Those who hesitate will suffer \u2013 like the clubs that didn\u2019t suitably plan for recruiting concessions granted to Gold Coast\n\nand GWS from 2009-2012. Such decisions were pivotal to Hawthorn assembling a player list to compete in four consecutive grand finals from 2012-2015.\n\nEssendon\u2019s strategy should be reviewed, analysed, executed then reviewed again. Its development isn\u2019t linear. It requires careful planning, periodical change and honest appraisal. No individual coach, staff member or executive can be allowed to hijack the process \u2013 some disagreement is expected, even encouraged, but it\u2019s critical that the coaching, player development, high performance and list management teams are aligned. The Bombers have young talent. With the fourth-youngest list in 2025, their age demographic is skewed towards the future. They are not starting another re-build, that undertaking was initiated\n\nmore than five years ago. Twenty list changes in the past two years have only accelerated the program. But it\u2019s essential they don\u2019t look at their players through a biased lens \u2013 coaches and recruiters often favour their preferred players when success demands the same standards apply to everyone.\n\nThey have the nucleus of a successful team \u2013 Andrew McGrath and Jordan Ridley in defence, Zach Merrett, Jye Caldwell and Sam Durham in the midfield plus Kyle Langford and Nate Caddy in attack provide a solid foundation for the future. But there are still too many players who show potential rather than consistent talent. Good one week, poor the next. Willing to follow rather than lead. Satisfied with playing at AFL level over being the best. Neither unflinching, uncompromising or unconditional. Zach Merrett leads Essendon onto the MCG. Credit: Getty Images More players need to become like their captain and coach \u2013 tough and relentless \u2013 strong leaders who view team success as their legacy. While 2025 is an important step along the way, Essendon must keep their focus on the bigger picture \u2013 they simply don\u2019t have the right personnel to win a premiership just yet.\n\nSo where to from here? Two statistics from 2025 clearly point to immediate needs. First, kicking efficiency \u2013 ranked 16th in the competition. Second, hard ball gets \u2013 also ranked 16th. Zak Butters will be a restricted free agent in 2026, and is the type of elite player Essendon should look to recruit. Credit: Getty Images Both statistics have been integral to premiership teams over the past 20 years, so ignore them at\n\nyour peril. The Bombers need players who can hurt the opposition by foot and/or win contested\n\npossession under pressure. And players who can break lines with their disposal. Essendon have high draft selections to work a trade for specific players in 2025 \u2013 they should firmly set their sights on Zak Butters (Port Adelaide) and Harley Reid (West Coast) if they can be convinced to return to Victoria.\n\nTheir early draft picks should only be expended to secure players of this calibre or to maximise their\n\ndraft position in 2025-26. Loading The draft is likely to be compromised by the Tassie Devils from 2027 so recruiting the best available young players now is of even more importance. While 2025 does not offer the same depth of talent as last year, the draft window is closing, so selection value is going to become greater over the next two years. Similarly, the Bombers should look to trade players who don\u2019t form part of their premiership model.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean releasing players at any cost but being prepared to take a step back to go forward\n\nin the longer term. These choices are sometimes contentious, but it is often the difficult decisions\n\nthat bring the biggest rewards. Players to consider:\n\nSam Draper As a free agent in 2025, Essendon should look to move him to improve their draft currency via AFL compensation or initiate a trade to a club offering the most favourable return. Essendon could be richly rewarded if they were willing to offload Sam Draper. Credit: AFL Photos Nik Cox v Harrison Jones Both players possess ability but have struggled with injury. With multiple \u201ctalls\u201d on the list, they will compete for a position in the same team. Retain one, move the other.\n\nDarcy Parish Loading Has been unlucky with injury but the development of Caldwell and Durham means he is better served at a club competing for a premiership in the short term. Peter Wright While he adds depth to their forward line, the Bombers should look to trade him while he still has limited currency. Not part of their premiership model.",

    "text": "The findings, while devastating, did not come as a shock to the Iskanders. \u201cWhen it is your first pregnancy, you leave your care in the hands of experts. You trust them,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cBut from day one we received very mixed and confusing messages from the hospital.\u201d The Iskanders and Mia in hospital after the delivery. The couple remember being told Danielle required an emergency cesarean, but rather than being rushed to the operating theatre, all they remember is waiting. \u201cWe weren\u2019t too stressed because we thought obviously if it was an emergency, they would rush me into surgery,\u201d Danielle said.\n\nThe first inclination that something was seriously wrong would come when Stephen was sitting outside the operating theatre waiting to be brought in to hold his newborn daughter, and he heard a message blare over the PA system. \u201cThey were calling a neonatal code blue,\u201d Stephen said, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cI\u2019m seeing people running in, but nobody is telling me what\u2019s going on.\u201d The hours that followed Mia\u2019s birth are a blur. They remember seeing Mia in a knitted beanie, wrapped in a blanket, with wires all over her tiny body, and taking photos of her to send to their family. The couple said they were not told the severity of the situation until an infant emergency team arrived to take the critically ill Mia to another hospital. \u201cWhen they told us to prepare for the worst and say goodbye to Mia, we were just completely blindsided,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cThere are no words to explain that moment.\u201d\n\nMia died less than eight hours after she was born. An independent expert, senior obstetric clinician Jeremy Chin, examined the case and found Mia\u2019s heart rate should have been treated as a red flag for \u201csignificant fetal compromise\u201d that required immediate management. However, Chin found that while a quicker delivery may have seen Mia delivered in a less severe state of oxygen deprivation, she was suffering from a perinatal infection that was \u201cultimately overwhelming\u201d. Danielle had been previously hospitalised and was receiving ongoing antibiotic treatment for a bacterial infection, which had progressed to an infection in the baby. The coroner found Danielle\u2019s treatment by the hospital before the day of Mia\u2019s delivery was reasonable and appropriate.\n\nThe official cause of Mia\u2019s death was found to be complications of a uterine infection in the setting of premature pre-labour rupture of membranes. Northern Health management declined to comment when contacted by The Age. \u201cAs this matter is currently before the courts, we are unable to comment at this time,\u201d a spokesperson said. The Iskanders said they were speaking out to prevent their tragedy from happening to another family. They also said a lack of mental health care and lack of support shown by the hospital after the ordeal further traumatised them.\n\nLoading \u201cWe were just left to deal with it all on our own,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cEvery time we called the hospital they were like \u2018why are you calling us? You\u2019ve already had your baby?\u2019 We would have to explain, yes, I had the baby, but the baby died.\u201d They called for reform in the healthcare system after several other deaths of babies and children in Victorian hospitals. On July 1, last year, they gave birth to another daughter, Maddison.\n\n\u201cIt was bittersweet,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cWe were so happy, but there is still so much grief about Mia.\u201d Mia\u2019s death is one of a number of hospital deaths of young children or babies being investigated by Victorian coroners. Last year, an inquest into the death of a 19-month-old Victorian toddler Noah Souvatzis in 2021 found his death was preventable. Noah died on December 30, 2021, from meningitis. The coroner found that the toddler was discharged after an inadequate review by an under-trained, junior locum doctor on his first shift. Latrobe Regional Hospital is also facing calls for an independent inquiry after it was revealed several patients, including infants, had died or experienced serious harm.",

I think they\u2019re doing a really good job,\u201d Taylor says. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Middleton replaced Katharine Murphy, who left her position as political editor last year to join the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Asked about the next steps for Guardian Australia, Taylor reaffirms a company policy not to discuss operational matters or anything related to the recent events in Canberra. Yet, in the 12 months since Murphy left, arguably, things in Canberra could not have gone worse. They included an independent HR investigation into claims and counterclaims within the team and a swift exodus of talent. (Four of its most senior reporters and its veteran photographer have left.)\n\nSix months after Middleton started as political editor, she filed an informal complaint against the company\u2019s long-standing chief political correspondent, Paul Karp, who responded with a counter-complaint of bullying.\n\nTaylor was kept at arm\u2019s length, considering she and Middleton were close friends of 35 years, having been cadets together at The Canberra Times and were former housemates. Former editor-in-chief of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger. Credit: Paul Morigi The investigation involved interviews with Karp, Middleton and other staff, and delivered its findings in December. All involved were bound by strict confidentiality agreements. The investigation found Middleton\u2019s bullying allegation against Karp could not be substantiated. Karp resigned soon after, and Middleton went on leave, where she remained until March when she and the organisation agreed on her exit. (In that tumultuous period, blogger and reporter Amy Remeikis joined the think tank, the Australia Institute, reporter Daniel Hurst moved to communications, and photographer Mike Bowers also departed.) It was a major decision to part ways with one of the most experienced press gallery journalists and biographer of the prime minister on the eve of a federal election, with incoming chief political correspondent Tom McIlroy to join only days before polling day.\n\nLoading Middleton and Karp did not respond to a series of questions. The situation punctuates a growing sentiment among journalists, many former and some current staff, that The Guardian has reached a point of maturity in Australia. It has succeeded where other international interlopers, such as BuzzFeed and HuffPost, have failed in breaking into Australia\u2019s media establishment, but now, it is no longer the punchy upstart it was 12 years ago, for better or worse. Part of the early success matched experienced editors from The Guardian\u2019s UK office with big-name local hires, says Rusbridger. It was a delicate balance between being the outsider and the disruptor, he says, but names such as Murphy and Taylor, alongside up-and-coming talent, helped, too. \u201cThat helped reassure readers it wasn\u2019t some external transplant; it wasn\u2019t outsiders parachuted in, it was people who had a local perspective.\u201d\n\nSome have argued the exit of major characters associated with the brand (Turnbull still refers to Murphy as \u201cMurpharoo\u201d, for example) over a sustained period has led to a loss of its once-renowned edge, a contention Taylor doesn\u2019t buy into. Loading \u201cI think we\u2019re growing a whole new generation of fantastic names for Australians,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI think it would be really arrogant for a senior journalist to say, \u2018no one will ever be a name like I was, or like my successor was\u2019. We\u2019ve got a whole new generation of fantastic journalists who are names already or who are going to be names.\u201d Taylor\u2019s confidence is backed up by several indicators of success. She is particularly pleased she proved former Fairfax boss Greg Hywood wrong when he told her on her departure there would only ever be two recognised news brands in Australia, alongside News Corp. Guardian Australia, which is published digitally in Australia, is one of the country\u2019s top-read outlets, with a monthly audience of between 7 million and 8 million Australians. Its audience grew 9 per cent over the past two years, according to the February figures from ratings agency Ipsos, but was outpaced by international publishers The New York Times (up 12 per cent) and the BBC (29 per cent) across the same period. Albeit, those had more room for growth.\n\nIn 2024, Guardian Australia made a modest $1.3 million in profit, yet this isn\u2019t a top priority for the not-for-profit trustee ownership. It remains free to access, urging its readers to pay on a voluntary basis, and has significantly grown its newsrooms and areas of coverage, Taylor says. \u201cIt is true, we\u2019re bigger and much more influential now, and I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cBeing a start-up is exciting, but there\u2019s not really anything romantic about trying to cover all the news in an ongoing way with a handful of reporters.\u201d Former Guardian Australia journalists Karen Middleton and Paul Karp. One criticism levelled by current and former staff is a legendarily low appetite for legally tricky stories which, they say, means it has lost some of its bite over the years. It\u2019s a contention Taylor, unsurprisingly, disagrees with. \u201cI think we are still breaking a lot of news. We still do hard-hitting analysis and opinion, and we\u2019ve added a lot of investigative clout to that as well,\u201d Taylor says.\n\n\u201cI think any publisher in Australia is aware of how our defamation laws work, so you need to be calculated and deliberate in the risks that you take, but we\u2019re not shy of taking risks if the story is in the public interest and worth it.\u201d Despite the commentary and exits, there is no need to reinvent the wheel or the mindset at Guardian Australia, says Taylor. Loading \u201cI think we are still distinctive in the same way that we were then, in that we are progressive. We look at the world through a progressive lens. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re partisan. We always follow the facts, but we look at things with the view that Australia and the world can change to be better and fairer. \u201cThe sort of essence of The Guardian is here as it\u2019s always been.\u201d\n\nOne senior News Corp editor, who requested anonymity to comment freely, affirms the outlet as a \u201cprofessional\u201d news outfit. \u201cBut the point to make is that all media organisations today define themselves and their business model according to a political slant.\u201d This applies to both The Guardian and The Australian, they say, which has led to an increasingly polarised electorate. \u201cMedia organisations don\u2019t want to admit that. It\u2019d be helpful if they did.\u201d Taylor\u2019s own role as editor has been the subject of speculation for some time, given she is now Australia\u2019s longest-serving editor after The Australian Financial Review\u2019s Michael Stutchbury stood down in mid-2024. Staff constantly speculate she is in line for a move to the UK head office or to take up an editorial role at the ABC, neither of which are happening, Taylor says.",

They\u2019re 14th in the Premier League with 16 defeats in 31 games so far, the most they\u2019ve suffered in a single campaign for more than two decades.\n\nAngeball is not dead. Not yet. Worst-case scenario, this project has exactly one week to live, assuming we believe the talk that Postecoglou\u2019s future in North London depends entirely upon winning the Europa League.\n\nThe English media might be openly speculating about Ange Postecoglou\u2019s replacement, and it might be that at least half of the Tottenham Hotspur fanbase is counting down the seconds until the club posts a generic social media graphic and the words \u2018Club Statement: Ange Postecoglou\u2019 on its official channels, and there might be a priest in the room, holding a bible, ready to go - but there is still a pulse.\n\nInjuries explain it - at one stage they were missing a dozen key first-team players, and had zero centre-backs available for weeks on end - but only to a point. All their big stars have returned over the past few weeks, but they have generally stunk it up. Patience has run out, and something resembling psychological warfare has broken out between the manager and the supporters.\n\nThere have been shades of 2017 about Postecoglou\u2019s prickly demeanour of late. That was his last year with the Socceroos, when he walked out on the Australian game just six months before the World Cup, having realised he alone couldn\u2019t \u2018fix\u2019 it. He admitted he had become worn down and didn\u2019t like who he\u2019d become.\n\nAnge Postecoglou - celebrating, not praying. Credit: Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s a bit similar now. He doesn\u2019t look happy. His contempt for certain journalists in the Spurs press pack is no longer concealed, and he can\u2019t help but snap back at the fans who taunt him during and after games. Last week, after the away fans at Chelsea chanted \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d when he took off Lucas Bergvall for Pape Matar Sarr, he cupped his ears in their general direction when Sarr scored shortly afterwards. The goal was then disallowed. He tried to explain later that he just wanted to hear the fans supporting the team, but nobody believed him.\n\nIt was, as they say, Spursy behaviour. He\u2019s supposed to be the antidote, but it\u2019s infecting him.",

Matt O\u2019Donohue Previous Slide Next Slide Good Food hat 15.5 / 20 How we score Mexican$$$$ Consider, for a moment, the evolution of the wine bar in Australia. Previously\n\navailable in just four flavours \u2013 French, Italian and Spanish, plus a broadly\n\n\u201cEuropean\u201d catch-all \u2013 wine bars have significantly broadened their horizons over the past decade. In Melbourne, there\u2019s Manze: a Mauritian wine bar that taps into the diverse island heritage of co-owner Nagesh Seethiah. The enduring popularity of Brisbane\u2019s Snack Man, meanwhile, is a reminder that lo-fi wines can do things for Asian food that tea can only dream of. (See also the Taiwanese-inspired cooking at Muni in McLaren Vale, South Australia: one of my standout meals of 2024.) Following the recent discovery of a maverick inner-city wine bar serving bold, brilliant Mexican cookery, Perth has entered the genre\u2019s DEI chat. Sort of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew-era Mexican cooking for the discerning (wine) drinker. Matt O\u2019Donohue I say sort-of because the food at Casa, the Mount Hawthorn wine bar in question,\n\ndoesn\u2019t just hang its hat on cocina Mexicana. Italy, for one, forms a healthy chunk of its playbook: think thick shoelaces of tonnarelli pasta and tiny mopheads of crab meat bound in a lurid jalapeno butter. Toast graffitied with fat squiggles of chicken liver parfait is typical of the bistro cooking that might appear while the menu occasionally dabbles in retro throwbacks (hello prawn cocktail lettuce cups). I also say sort-of because, according to Casa chef Paul Bentley, his cooking isn\u2019t\n\nwhat he\u2019d describe as Mexican food. Or at least Mexican food made by someone\n\nwith an intrinsic understanding of the cuisine and culture. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with an abuela [grandmother] cooking birria [a classic Mexican goat stew] on the weekends,\u201d says Bentley. What our man did do, though, was spend a decade working in Mexico where, among other things, he opened Magno Brasserie \u2013 a distillation of everything he learned under legendary Perth chef Alain Fabregues at The Loose Box and Daniel Boulud of New York\u2019s French powerhouse Daniel \u2013 operated ramen bars, plus ran a string of bakeries. (So that\u2019s why Casa\u2019s pillowy focaccia and the dough at its pizzeria spin-off are both so good! The peso drops.) The other thing Bentley did in Mexico was eat plenty of Mexican food, from the fancy to the street. So much so that when COVID lockdowns stranded our man in Perth, he brought his understanding of spice and acidity to the food he was cooking at Si Paradiso \u2013 the tepache (fermented pineapple juice) he\u2019d slip onto pizzas, say \u2013 as well as Scarborough\u2019s goodtime beachside cantina, El Grotto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when Bentley and fellow Casa partners Cale Mason and Sydney-based chef\n\nEnrico Tomelleri of Darlinghurst\u2019s magnetic Paski Sopra opened Casa in 2021, it felt inevitable that Mexican influences would seep into that menu too. That octopus would be cooked al pastor taco style and laid across toast. (No longer on the menu, alas.) That a herbal Mayan-influenced pumpkin seed dip would partner said focaccia, and that those pepitas would also be turned into a salsa for grilled cabbage, charry from the grill. Both, thankfully, are still on the menu, as are more recent creations a la skewers of juicy lamb rump brightened by a sauce bright with barbacoa spice. A new kind of wine bar. Matt O\u2019Donohue But for the new-new stuff, it\u2019s all about the $79 chef\u2019s menu. Once an outlet for\n\nBentley\u2019s classically minded French cooking, the set-course option is now a four-\n\nstage meal comprised largely of off-menu items sporting a strong Mexican flavour. Sometimes the influence is subtle: the zip of pickled cactus in the flank steak tartare, maybe, or casting crunchy tostadas as ideal vehicles for highlighting the silken pleasures of pristine cured bonito.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther times though, the accent comes through loud and clear. That would be the\n\nbrooding mole poblano \u2013 a rich, slow-cooked fantasy of dark chocolate, dried fruit and a supermarket aisle\u2019s worth of spice \u2013 pooled underfoot rosy, dry-aged Wagin duck breast. The bird\u2019s legs, meanwhile, form the filling for dainty flautas: rolled-up, fried tacos that are even more fun to eat than they sound. (The tortillas for the flautas and tostada, incidentally, are made locally by the nixtamalized corn whisperers at La Tortilla.) Good Food hat 15.5 / 20 Review This French bistro is a masterclass in knowing when to follow and when to flout the rules For anyone that\u2019s been stung by tasting menus that feel lazy, underdone or\n\noffer questionable bang-for-buck, Casa\u2019s offering may help restore your faith in the format. Not that committing to a (somewhat restaurant-y) menu is mandatory for enjoying yourself here. Like any self-respecting wine bar, Casa has a welcoming, third-place charm that makes it feel like an extension of home, even if those rendered walls, mid-century accents and finely tuned speakers make it feel like the living room of an especially well-designed holiday home in Milan. You can push the boat out, even on a weeknight, or drop in a bowl of chips with green Goddess sauce or a scoop of pistachio gelato: switched-on and engaged staff will make you feel welcome, regardless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Casa isn\u2019t the first place to have thought of serving tacos alongside vino. While not explicitly wine bars, establishments such as El Publico and La Cholita helped expose Perth eaters to Mexican food-and-drink matches beyond Coronas and bottles of tequila with worms in them. The joys of eating jarred salsa and packet corn chips on the couch are near universal, not least with bottles of juicy pinot noir, Yellowglen and the remote in easy reach. Thanks to the ubiquitousness of Old El Paso et al, you and I can enjoy such Tex-Mex pleasures without having to leave the house. But for Mexican-ish cooking of a higher calibre \u2013 and plenty more besides \u2013\n\nwe\u2019ll have to go to Casa.

As flocks of migratory tree martins \u201cplummet\u201d from high in the sky to roost in trees at dusk, dozens are missing their mark and instead faceplanting hard into the brightly lit shopfront.\n\nFor over a decade, around 10,000 migratory tree martins have flocked to Leigh Street, one of Adelaide\u2019s most popular cafe strips. While their presence has delighted bird lovers, the city council has been less than impressed, claiming droppings from the \u201cproblem\u201d birds are a \u201cserious risk to public hygiene\u201d, and so it netted their trees to drive them away.\n\nBut the decision created an entirely new \u201cproblem\u201d for the birds after they arrived from the tropical north this season.

The birds spend their days high in the sky, catching insects, then fly down to roost in large groups as fast as they can to avoid predators like peregrine falcons.\n\nLocal rescuer Rachel is one of a handful of volunteers who have begun standing in front of the Apple store to collect the dead and dying tree martins. She estimates 30 are dying every evening and morning as the birds disperse. As they started coming into care around the city a week ago, she fears hundreds have already collided with the windows around Rundle Mall.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of birds. They come down fast and don\u2019t see the windows. I feel traumatised, disgusted and really upset,\u201d she told Yahoo News.\n\nRelated: New York City map reveals horrifying bird strike statistic\n\nAnother rescuer named Alyia watched on as dozens of shoppers excitedly gathered on the street to watch the birds fly into the nearby trees, but the mood changed after they began to hit the glass.\n\n\"People were there filming in amazement at the sheer amount of birds, but they quickly dispersed after the birds started hitting the windows. They stopped filming and walked off because it was horrific,\" she told Yahoo News.\n\n\"I saw two birds nearly stepped on. I screamed at one guy to stop him, because he didn't realise what he was about to do. And he looked back in absolute shock.\"\n\nShoppers shocked by bird carnage in front of Apple store\n\nExtensive video shot on Wednesday night shows the store closing for the day as the birds strike the glass. Passing shoppers appear stunned, and some rush to help as the carnage unfolds. Rescuers do their best to collect the birds and assess them for damage. \"This is as horrible as I thought it would be,\" one says. \"This is actually breaking my heart,\" another later adds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome birds die immediately, others need to be euthanised, a handful go into care with trained rescuers, a lucky few fly away, but the fate of others is unknown. \u201cSome were hitting the windows and falling onto roofs and we couldn\u2019t get to them, others were able to fly off again,\u201d Rachel explained.\n\nUS-based Apple has dimmed storefront lights in its home country to lessen its impact on migratory birds. But Rachel claims her pleas to the company\u2019s management in the Adelaide store have fallen on deaf ears. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Yahoo, so it remains unclear what it will do to mitigate the problem tonight.\n\nThe situation in Adelaide is believed to have been occurring for at least five days, and rescuers estimate hundreds of birds may have been affected. On Thursday, Adelaide\u2019s City Council told Yahoo News it has been \u201cdiscussing\u201d ways to respond to the problem.\n\n\u201cThe City of Adelaide became aware of increasing bird strikes against windows within Rundle Mall in the past week. We have been discussing mitigation measures with retailers, including trialling new lighting,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe situation is being closely monitored by City of Adelaide staff and government environmental agencies.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome birds have died instantly, while others were taken into care. Source: SA Native Animal Rescue\n\nBird expert 'saddened' by Adelaide bird deaths\n\nBirdlife Australia\u2019s Sean Dooley told Yahoo News news of the carnage had left him \u201cquiet sad\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s so rare to have such good numbers of a native species using a dense urban setting as a roosting site. It\u2019s very unusual,\u201d he said.\n\nCollisions with windows are common in the United States, particularly in Chicago and New York City where large building have been built in the middle of migratory pathways birds have used for thousands of years. But in Australia, most native birds are territorial, and so window strikes are less of a problem.\n\nBright storefronts confuse birds, particularly when its reflective. \u201cThey don\u2019t see the windows as as a solid object, they just see sky, so they continue to fly,\u201d Dooley said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the evening, lights inside stores can disorientate birds, preventing them from understanding where they are spatially in relation to the moon.\n\n\u201cThe more buildings are lit up, the more likely birds are to blunder into them,\u201d Dooley added.\n\nThe birds were forced to relocate after the City of Adelaide placed nets on their traditional roosting trees.

We consider Adelaide\u2019s tree martins a shining case for how our city can be wild,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are actively engaged in discussions with the City of Adelaide and welcome collaborative opportunities to enhance welfare outcomes for these birds.\u201d\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
