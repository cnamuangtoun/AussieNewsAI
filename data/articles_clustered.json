    "text": "The use of \"Snicko\" as part of cricket's decision review system (DRS) has been called into question after an apparent error cost England a wicket on day one of the third Ashes Test.\n\nAlex Carey revealed after his crowning century on his home ground in Adelaide that he thought he had \"feathered\" a bottom edge through to the wicketkeeper while on 72.\n\nHe was given not out on the field, and umpire Ahsan Raza's decision was upheld after England's review as a clear spike on the snicko soundwave came two frames before the ball reached the bat.\n\n\"Looks like it's gone well under the bat there,\" third umpire Chris Gaffaney said.\n\n\"[The spike's] before the bat. There's a clear gap, no spike.\"\n\nAfter play, Carey said he \"thought there was a feather or some sort of noise when it passed the bat\", while adding he would have reviewed had he been given out, although not with much confidence.\n\nThe technology's operator, BBG Sports, said Carey \"admitted he had hit the ball\" (which is debatable) and therefore \"the only conclusion that can be drawn\" is that the person trying to sync up the audio and vision used the sound from the wrong stump microphone.\n\n\"In light of this, BBG Sports takes full responsibility for the error,\" it told the BBC.\n\nIn recognition of this, England got its review back on day two.\n\nThe Adelaide controversy came after two incidents in the opening Test in Perth, where a small \"murmur\" on snicko was enough to overturn an on-field not out decision, despite the disturbance on the soundwave arriving a frame after passing the bat.\n\nIt was made worse by the fact Marnus Labuschagne escaped the same fate in remarkably similar circumstances a day earlier, with former ICC umpire of the year Simon Taufel saying third umpires were instructed to allow for one frame of leeway either side of the bat.\n\nEngland baffled as DRS call rocks Ashes The first Ashes Test encounters its first umpiring controversy as England wicketkeeper Jamie Smith is given out in an incident similar to one which Australia's Marnus Labuschagne survived.\n\nEx-England captain Michael Atherton said on Sky Sports that he sympathised with the third umpire's decision because \"it was massively out of sync\", with co-host and fellow former skipper Nasser Hussain saying it was not fit for purpose.\n\n\"It brings into question the use of snicko, doesn't it?\" Hussain said.\n\n\"If you're one frame out, that's fine, that's just the error in the system, but then if it's two or three \u2026 it becomes a little bit confusing for a viewer [or] a person on the ground.\n\n\"The whole point of technology is to try and clear these things up.\"\n\nFormer Australian Test quick Jason Gillespie said the fact that there is a margin for human and technological error built into the process was evidence that the system was not working correctly.\n\nAlex Carey added 34 crucial runs after the DRS controversy. (Getty Images: Phillip Brown)\n\n\"They're allowing wiggle room with the technology, and that says to me the technology isn't spot on,\" he told ABC Sport.\n\nEngland bowling coach David Saker said in Adelaide, \"there's been concerns about [snicko] for the whole series\".\n\nThe tourists are more used to UltraEdge \u2014 an ostensibly similar product but one that uses 340 frames-per-second footage and HawkEye ball-tracking technology to detect edges, rather than having an operator trying to manually sync audio and vision.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board has paid for the technology in its series, while in Australia, host broadcaster Fox Sports has footed the bill for the cheaper alternative.\n\n\"This technology that we are using here is simply not as good as technology that's used in other countries,\" Australian legend Ricky Ponting said on Channel Seven.\n\n\"You talk to the umpires, they'll tell you the same thing: They can't trust it.\n\n\"They've got a third umpire sitting up there that's got to make decisions based on what he's seeing that the technology is providing, and sometimes they have a gut feel that it's not right.\n\n\"That can't happen. You've got to be able to trust the technology that's in place.\"\n\nFormer Australia fast bowler Stuart Clark questioned whether more responsibility should be placed on the on-field umpires to get the call right in the first place.\n\n\"What was the umpire doing? Has he got any fault in this?\" he said on ABC Sport.\n\n\"The umpires are out there, and if the umpire's not good enough to get decisions right, maybe the ICC should get rid of them.\"\n\nWhether it be DRS, the NRL's vaunted bunker, or VAR in football, in the quest for perfection, this is another instance of technology's inaccuracies creating more controversy and frustrations for players and fans.\n\n\"DRS can either be your friend or your foe,\" former England Test player and umpire David Lloyd said on Seven.\n\n\"Just say there's no DRS, the umpire decided in his mind he's not hit that, and we wouldn't be talking about it now if we didn't have DRS.\n\n\"DRS is supposed to improve everything; now we're talking about DRS's failure. It's not worked.\"",

It will also have to pay his lost earnings.\n\n\"It is very clear Mr Bandameeda values his work with Amazon,\" Commissioner Allison's findings said.\n\n\" \u2026 the incident on 4 April 2025 did not arise from Mr Bandameeda wilfully breaching a condition of the Terms of Service, but rather a situation where Mr Bandameeda was trying to perform his job well and had to negotiate a complex situation with competing requirements.\"\n\nThe competing requirements included that, according to Amazon's terms of service, he was unable to leave the package on the doorstep because it was visible from the road, and unable to leave it in the wind as drivers were told not to expose parcels to \"inclement weather\".\n\nHe was also required to contact the customer. Commissioner Allison found Mr Bandameeda had \"reasonably assumed\" that the man who invited him inside was the person who had ordered the package, and that he would have been perceived as \"difficult and rude\" had he ignored his instructions \u2014 breaching the requirement to behave \"respectfully and professionally\".\n\n\"I note that the circumstances facing Mr Bandameeda do not appear to be particularly unique and one can image many circumstances where delivery partners are put in a position where they have to choose between competing requirements,\" Commissioner Allison wrote.\n\n\" If Amazon wants the requirement not to enter a home under any circumstances to be prioritised above other requirements \u2014 this needs to be made clear. \"\n\nAsked about the findings, an Amazon spokesman said: \"We clearly state to delivery partners that they are not to enter customers' homes under any circumstances, and that doing so is a breach of the Amazon Flex terms of service.\n\n\"We will reiterate to delivery partners the important requirement that they should not enter a customer's residence.\"\n\nPleas ignored by e-commerce giant\n\nThe newly built Amazon fulfilment centre in Horsley Park. (ABC News: Liam Patrick)\n\nDigital labour platforms are required to have a human representative consider a contractor's response before deactivating their account.\n\n\"I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that a human representative considered Mr Bandameeda's response,\" Commissioner Allison wrote.\n\nIn follow-up emails after receiving notice of the breach, Mr Bandameeda repeatedly requested a chance to explain his perspective.\n\n\"Please I want to talk to the team and I'm getting auto reply for this issue please it's a big thing for me just give me a chance to talk to you,\" he wrote.\n\nLater that day, he wrote: \" \u2026 please give me a chance to explain everything.\"\n\nIn a third email, he requested a phone call \u2013 again without success.\n\nDrivers \u2014 known as delivery partners \u2014 are independent contractors who effectively compete for shifts on the app.",

    "text": "Two years on from the industry-shaking SAG-AFTRA/Writer's Guild strikes and Hollywood remains on unsteady ground.\n\nOut of the three highest-grossing films for the year, and the only movies to hit the fabled $US1 billion, two were animated sequels and one was a reboot. Many films were prescribed \"flops\" for not reaching the supposed monetary heights of a pre-pandemic industry.\n\nThe potential of legacy studio Warner Bros most likely being absorbed into streaming monolith Netflix flung up further worries of the future of the movie theatre.\n\nBut dig past the fear-mongering headlines and you'll find 2025 provided absorbing, effective and original stories in every genre from drama to comedy to horror.\n\nRyan Coogler's Sinners pulled off one of the most successful genre fusion projects in recent memory; first-time director Eva Victor delivered an grounded reflection on what it means to go through trauma; The Lonely Island's Akiva Shaffer proved reboots don't have to be pandering slop with The Naked Gun and, closer to home, YouTube exports Philippou Brothers and Michael Shanks kept the Australian horror industry pumping.\n\nHere are the films that had our critics seated at the cinema this year.\n\nBring Her Back\n\nJonah Wren Phillips turns in a chilling performance as Ollie in Bring Her Back.\n\nThe Oscars has beef with horror, often overlooking frightful gems, having happily feted the likes of The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby in the past.\n\nFast facts about Bring Her Back Starring: Sally Hawkins, Billy Barratt, Sora Wong, Jonah Wren Phillips Director: Danny and Michael Philippou Where: Streaming on Prime Video\n\nGuillermo del Toro's dark and fishy fairy tale, The Shape of Water, is a recent exception, winning four golden statuettes in 2018, including Best Picture and Best Director. Sally Hawkins, nominated for Best Actress, lost out to Frances McDormand for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\n\nIf there were any justice, Hawkins would bring one home for her infinitely superior turn in ace Adelaide filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou's devastating Bring Her Back.\n\nShe plays Laura, a foster carer in dire need of a background check, broken by the unimaginable grief of losing a child. Charged with recently orphaned Andy (Billy Barratt) and his younger, blind sister, Piper (Sora Wong), there's something not quite right about her hippie-dip persona.\n\nPlying them with alcohol after their dad's funeral may have cool aunt energy, but it's not exactly responsible adulting. Neither is her obsessive watching of an arcane ritual captured on scuzzy VHS tape.\n\nBring Her Back is a horror movie you'll only watch once The latest offering from Talk To Me's breakout directors supplies phenomenal performances and touching relationships\u2026 if you can stomach the gore.\n\nThen there's the other kid in her care, a magnificent wig-out performance from Jonah Wren Phillips as Oliver, a boy of no words who'd rather chew kitchen benches and blades than lollies. What horrible design connects him to Piper via Laura's tragedy?\n\nThe answers will wreck you in this brutal chiller that eschews Talk to Me's sassy teen spirit in favour of something much more fearsome, scarring your soul, as with the very best horror.\n\nStephen A Russell\n\nBugonia\n\nEmma Stone's character in Bugonia is a master manipulator in negotiating her release. (Image: Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features)\n\nHas cinema finally caught up to our current moment, or has the universe aligned itself with the off-kilter cruelty of Yorgos Lanthimos's films? Either way, the celebrated Greek director's latest feature \u2013 a remake of Jang Joon-hwan's Save the Green Planet! \u2013 was his most satisfying satire in years.\n\nFast facts about Bugonia Starring: Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Aidan Delbis Directed by: Yorgos Lanthimos Where: In select cinemas now\n\nA bald Emma Stone was pitted against a bedraggled Jesse Plemons in the film's tightly-wound narrative, in which a pharmaceutical CEO is locked up by conspiracy theorists who believe her to be an alien wreaking havoc on humanity.\n\nEmma Stone shaved her head for Bugonia, but that's just the beginning Yorgos Lanthimos continues his journey as the king of absurdist dark comedies with this latest offering, starring Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons.\n\nStone's gimlet-eyed girl-boss attempts to condescend her way out of her predicament; Plemons's aggrieved factory worker (with assistance from his loyal, suggestible cousin [Aidan Delbis]) favours more direct methods of coercion in his aim to contact extraterrestrial royalty.\n\nThe ensuing chaos is told like a sick cosmic joke, with a profound sadness bubbling beneath Lanthimos's deadpan wit. Extreme as Bugonia's goons are, their motives and beliefs are far from inscrutable.\n\nSo determined to wrestle control over their lives, they even subject themselves to chemical castration in a bid to clear their of head of \"psychic compulsions\". Riddled with brain worms and without a single thing \u2014 not even their balls \u2014 to lose, they're a disturbingly familiar threat.\n\nJamie Tram\n\nEddington\n\nPedro Pascal and Joaquin Pheonix square off in Eddington. (Universal)\n\nNot just the year's most exquisitely unhinged movie, Ari Aster's sinister pandemic satire might also be its sharpest.\n\nFast facts about Eddington Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone Directed by: Ari Aster Where: Available to rent or buy digitally\n\nNominally a darkly comic period piece about a small American town in the grip of COVID-19, the Midsommar and Hereditary director's latest (and scariest) horror movie dared to diagnose the world's current collective psychosis, unravelling a future historian's nightmare of dipshit political squabbling, virtue signalling madness, and wild, woolly conspiracy theories that just might turn out to be true.\n\nIt all begins with a gnarly vagrant marching upon town, like some spooky prehistoric doomsayer, and ends with the kind of illuminati checkmate that makes the far-right cretins of One Battle After Another look like the local chapter of the Rotary Club.\n\nIn between, we get Joaquin Phoenix's libertarian sheriff and Pedro Pascal's shifty progressive mayor squaring off like a pair of mythic gunfighters at high noon, Emma Stone communing with tchotchkes and conspiracy nuts, and Austin Butler swaggering into town as a swarthy cult leader connected \u2014 like the film itself \u2014 to something far wider and weirder than anyone could imagine.\n\nBecause it's Aster, it's also ghoulishly funny \u2014 the film's bleak kiss-off is one of the great cosmic punchlines in modern cinema \u2014 and rife with unforgettable imagery, even (and especially) when his button-pushing tendencies stray toward the discomfiting.\n\nContrary to the accusations of shit-posting misanthropy, this deeply empathetic, if unsettling movie proves \u2014 in what might turn out to be its most unexpected twist \u2014 that Aster is a humanist after all.\n\nLuke Goodsell\n\nKPop Demon Hunters\n\nKPop Demon Hunters was a global smash hit. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nBy now you're probably sick of hearing monolith hit single Golden blasting from every supermarket speaker and toddler mouth around you. But there was a time where Sony couldn't wait to offload the now mega-hit animated musical film, KPop Demon Hunters.\n\nFast facts about KPop Demon Hunters Starring: Arden Cho, Ahn Hyo-seop, May Hong, Ji-young Yoo Directed by: Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans Where: Netflix\n\nMade by Sony for $US100 million, the studio baulked at the possibility of a pandemic-era flop, leading them to sell the sugar rush flick to Netflix who quietly released it on-platform in June.\n\nThe story of Huntrix, a KPop trio who must defeat a demonic boy band with just their pitch-perfect vocals and killer choruses took a couple months to catch its audience.\n\nBut when it rained it poured.\n\nBy August, KPop Demon Hunters was Netflix's most-watched film, clocking 236 million viewings worldwide. It entered cinemas internationally (including Australia!) in October making a cool $US25 million at the box office.\n\nThe multi-hit soundtrack has sold more than 1 million copies, topped the Billboard 100 AND shone a well-deserved light on the storied career of South Korean musician Ejae who shaped KPDH's musical direction and provides the singing voice of Huntrix lead Rumi.\n\nPossibly the craziest part about this story is that all of this praise and attention is 100 per cent deserved.\n\nSwipe aside the under-10's fanaticism and you'll find an original, engaging and tight narrative which makes the 2D/3D animation mash up popularised by Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse look fresh. Co-writer and director Maggie Kang infuses the story with both Korean folklore and modern KPop culture to connect the past and the present nation (so it's basically educational).\n\nKPop Demon Hunters is a rollercoaster ride of a film and a cautionary tale for studios to believe in their art.\n\nVelvet Winter\n\nOne Battle After Another\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio has been praised for his work as a dressing gown-clad revolutionary in One Battle After Another. (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)\n\nIn a year where so many auteur-driven projects failed to connect with audiences, major studios recycled franchise IP to ever diminishing returns, and the creative industry barrelled toward the precipice of AI slop, Paul Thomas Anderson's rollicking action thriller \u2014 loosely derived from Thomas Pynchon's Vineland \u2014 reminded us of just how exhilarating cinema can be at its best.\n\nFast facts about One Battle After Another Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Chase Infiniti, Benicio del Toro, Teyana Taylor Directed by: Paul Thomas Anderson Where: Available to rent or buy digitally and showing in select cinema\n\nAs much a requiem for the revolutionary ideals of one generation as it is a rallying call for the potential of the next, One Battle After Another lit the fuse on a national powder keg, pitting an underground network of scrappy outsiders against a comically shady cabal of white supremacists.\n\nIt then sits back \u2014 a few small beers in hand \u2014 to watch the fireworks explode.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's latest movie already eyed for Best Picture One Battle After Another, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, uses the ever-turning wheel of political violence as a backdrop for a screwball adventure. Sean Penn's hapless army colonel explaining \u2014 in excruciating comic detail \u2014 just how his \"seed\" was extracted, his face twisted into a final expression of stupid, impotent rage. Take your pick of memorable moments: Teyana Taylor's heavily pregnant freedom fighter, blasting away with a machine gun resting on her exposed belly; Leonardo DiCaprio's stoner burnout, permanently attired in a crusty dressing gown and dollar-store shades, tumbling into the getaway car of Benicio del Toro's sensei to the sound of the Jackson 5's Ready Or Not;Sean Penn's hapless army colonel explaining \u2014 in excruciating comic detail \u2014 just how his \"seed\" was extracted, his face twisted into a final expression of stupid, impotent rage.\n\nStill, for all its charismatic performances and bravura sequences \u2014 including a vertiginous desert car chase that put every 2025 blockbuster set-piece to shame \u2014 the beating heart of Anderson's film is its story of an absent dad trying to connect with his daughter, and the anxiety over the passing of the torch (or the vape) from one generation to another.\n\nIn a career filled with highs, it felt like the writer-director's most personal \u2014 and most moving \u2014 work.\n\nLuke Goodsell\n\nSinners\n\nMichael B.

Not that the Black Panther director is in a hurry to tip his hat.\n\nBrothers Smoke and Stack, both played by Coogler's Creed star Michael B. Jordan, dallied with gangsters in Chicago. But they've ditched Al Capone's too-hot scene, returning to a Deep South rancid with Klansmen.\n\nFast facts about Sinners Starring: Michael B Jordan, Wunmi Mosaku, Hailee Steinfeld, Jack O'Connell, Li Jun Li, Yao Director: Ryan Coogler Where: Streaming on HBO Max\n\nThey'll be damned if they'll give up their patch to a white robe-wearing lynch mob. Opening a prohibition-style, whisky-soaked 'Juke' joint, they recruit blues singers, a band and immigrant Chinese grocers (Li Jun Li and Yao) to get the joint jumping.\n\nStack's snacking after True Grit actor Hailee Steinfeld's spiky Mary, while Smoke reignites his flame with left-behind love Annie (Loki star Wunmi Mosaku). The latter keeps the home fires burning, casting old spells to keep evil spirits at bay.\n\nIt's to no avail. Recalling, though far surpassing, Robert Rodriguez's delayed reveal in From Dusk Till Dawn, there's vamps in them thar no hills (actually, it's the Mississippi Delta).\n\n'71 star Jack O'Connell's undead Irish ghoul, Remmick, leads a hunt of baleful ancient bloodsuckers drawn out by the Juke's soulful sounds.\n\nWith muscle memory for Black brilliance across the ages, writer/director Coogler delivers the year's finest scene, abetted by gifted cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw and Swedish composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, as musical history once and future folds in on the dance floor.\n\nWhen the monsters bring mayhem to the merry-makers' door, Sinners proves it's a film with bite, leaving a mark forevermore.\n\nStephen A Russell\n\nSorry, Baby\n\nSorry, Baby is the debut feature film from writer, director and star Eva Victor. (Supplied: VVS Films)\n\nSorry, Baby shouldn't be as funny as it is, given the logline: A promising literature graduate is sexually assaulted by her professor and quietly moves forward in her life.\n\nFast facts about Sorry, Baby Starring: Eva Victor, Naomi Ackie, Lucas Hedges, John Carroll Lynch Director: Eva Victor Where: Available to rent or buy digitally\n\nBut this warm, tender film \u2014 the debut by writer-director Eva Victor, who also stars in the lead role \u2014 is a remarkable balance of light and dark. Pointedly understated, Sorry, Baby sidesteps the manipulative practices of many post-#MeToo films that tie their intrigue to revealing an assault.\n\nThe audience doesn't see the 'bad thing', as Agnes (Victor) often calls it, but instead a static shot of the house which contains Agnes and her professor as day turns to evening, then night.\n\nHow to make a film about sexual assault that doesn't make survivors freeze Writer, director and star Ava Victor's honest and hilarious portrayal of time before, during and after sexual assault has made Sorry, Baby one of the most talked about films of 2025.\n\nWhile the film's camera almost exclusively follows Agnes throughout, here the distance is dissociative. It both proves that you don't need to see something to believe it, and portrays just how abstracting violence can be.\n\nNone of this sounds funny. But Agnes is a funny person \u2014 an awkward, witty figure who remains so in trauma, itself a confusing experience. Her relationships \u2014 especially with her best friend (Naomi Ackie) and neighbour (Lucas Hedges) \u2014 are charming, quirky and lived-in.\n\nIt's an immensely impressive and gorgeous debut, making great use of New England's sparse, ominous beauty and has connected deeply with survivors. It leads by example, with a patience towards Agnes's pain that lets her breathe, ache and continue on.\n\nJared Richards\n\nThe Naked Gun\n\nTurning detective dramas on their head, the latest Naked Gun has reignited the spoof genre. (Paramount Pictures)\n\nWith more punchlines than minutes, The Naked Gun is a rare beast in 2025 \u2014 it's both a reboot that doesn't land like a cynical cash grab, and an unashamed comedy overflowing with pratfalls, puns, sight gags and delightfully silly jokes.\n\nFast facts about The Naked Gun Starring: Liam Neeson, Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser Director: Akiva Schaffer Where: Available to rent or buy digitally\n\nCreated by comedy trio ZAZ, the original Naked Gun trilogy of the '80s and '90s sent up the era's overblown action films, starring the late Leslie Nielsen as slightly daft Lieutenant Frank Drebin. Here, Liam Neeson plays Drebin Jr \u2014 a genius casting that plays off the actor's grizzled tough-guy persona, with Drebin Jr a resentful cop who longs for the good old days.\n\nBy treating The Naked Gun as if it was Taken 4, Neeson makes it all the more ridiculous.\n\nAfter failing to stop a bank heist where a villain captures a powerful device called 'P.L.O.T Device', Drebin Jr uncovers a huge, silly conspiracy. He teams up with the smoky-voiced Pamela Anderson, finally in a role that matches her cultural renaissance.\n\nThankfully, this spoof isn't laboured with current pop-culture references to appeal to new audiences, instead focusing on unapologetically stupid, absurd gags. No, not every joke will make you laugh. But they come so quick there's no space for a thud to echo out.\n\nJared Richards\n\nTogether\n\nReal-life husband and wife Dave Franco and Alison Brie star in Together from Australian writer/director Michael Shanks. (Supplied: Kismet)\n\nRelationships can be a horror show, and no other movie articulated this concept better than Australian filmmaker Michael Shanks.\n\nFast facts about Together Starring: Dave Franco, Alison Brie, Damon Herriman Directed by: Michael Shanks Where: Available to rent or buy digitally\n\nBorn from the YouTube set of the mid-20s, Shanks spent 10 years perfecting his script for this twisted feature, based partly on his own long-term relationship (don't worry, she's cool with it).\n\nAfter landing on The Black List (Hollywood's annual list of hottest unproduced screenplays), Shanks caught the eye of Hollywood power couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie, who lend their starpower as the film's two protagonists.\n\nThis Aus director went to the US to get noticed. Then his film sold for $26m Together, a new body horror starring Alison Brie and Dave Franco, sold for $26 million at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Now the world is finally being let in to Australian director Michael Shanks's sticky nightmare.\n\nTim (Franco) and Millie (Brie) have been together for more than a decade but their relationship is fragmenting. A move to the countryside to support Millie's teaching career (at the detriment of Tim's musical aspirations) pushes them closer to the edge \u2014 and this is before they both fall into a mysterious, throbbing hole in the forest.\n\nPost-hole-falling, things start to get weird for Tim and Millie as an invisible force sees them physically dragged together with horrific results. Together is as much an unflinching body horror as it is a rumination on the co-dependency of long term relationships, with Brie and Franco's real-life marriage adding extra validity to the on-screen performances.\n\nBut what really sets Together apart from the rest, in what was a very good year for horror, is the care that oozes out of every shot. Shanks wrote, directed and created many of the film's stunning special effects and the passion for his project is undeniable.\n\nVelvet Winter\n\nWeapons\n\nJulia Garner is a teacher haunted by her missing classic in Weapons. (Supplied: Warner Bros)\n\nNo matter who wins the bidding war over Warner Brothers, the outlook for one of Hollywood's oldest institutions feels undeniably bleak.\n\nNonetheless, 2025 will be remembered as a year where the studio set multiplexes alight with a slate of audacious original films.\n\nFast facts about Weapons Starring: Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich Directed by: Zach Cregger Where: Streaming on HBO Max\n\nWeapons was the kind of go-for-broke sophomore feature made by a director with something to prove.\n\nAgainst the odds, Zach Cregger exceeded the promise of his 2022 debut, Barbarian, with this bedevilling urban legend told through the eyes of a small Pennsylvanian community.\n\nTwo years on from the shocking exodus of seventeen third-graders from their bedrooms, suspicion still lingers around their young teacher Justine (Julia Garner).\n\nThere is a tangible malevolent force at play \u2014 mercifully, humankind is not revealed as the real monsters \u2014 but Weapons cannily exposes the ruptures of grief through a tight-knit town, as well as the obsessive paranoia that can follow in its wake. It's also a deeply funny film.\n\nCregger mines memorable visual gags from the pin prick of a used needle, a generous platter of hotdogs, and a gargantuan assault rifle towering over a house. After the previous decade of horror films leaning on trauma as a thematic crutch, it's satisfying to watch Weapons rip the bandaid off its festering wound.",

    "text": "In the heart of the country, surrounded by hundreds of kilometres of red dirt and countless termite mounds, growing barley is mostly unheard of.\n\nBut at Athelle Outback Hideaway, a 2,100-hectare property about 140 kilometres north of Alice Springs, that's exactly what Anthony and Danyelle Haigh have done.\n\nHaving already grown Rhodes grass, lucerne and oats for hay on 300 hectares of the property, the pair have just finished harvesting 34 hectares of barley.\n\nThe Haighs, known for their starring roles on Outback Truckers and Outback Farm, utilise groundwater for cropping, and supply local cattle producers and pastoralists with hay.\n\nThere are only a few cropping enterprises across Central Australia and they are spread out over hundreds of kilometres, relying on access to groundwater in an otherwise arid landscape.\n\nThe farm is thousands of kilometres from the typical barley growing regions, grown extensively across the east coast and south-west Western Australia, where rainfall is more reliable and where temperatures remain lower.\n\nBarley is the second-largest crop in Australia by volume and third in value, with the grain being widely used in the brewing industry as well as animal feed.\n\nAs he sat in his tractor, circling the centre-pivot irrigation at Athelle, Anthony said it was pretty extraordinary to see the crop amongst the red dirt.\n\n\"It's always good to see big green circles out here. It's not something you see in the middle of the desert anyway,\" Mr Haigh said.\n\nThe green crop of barley contrasted starkly to the desert's red dirt from the top of the Haigh's tractor. (ABC Rural: Charles Geary)\n\nDelays defining decision\n\nMr Haigh said barley's ability to deal with intense heat was behind the experiment, as temperatures in the region regularly exceeded 30 degrees Celsius when the crop was planted in the spring season.\n\n\"We wanted to put oats into it, but we were a little bit late,\" Mr Haigh said.\n\n\"So we've gone with the barley cause it will tolerate a bit more heat towards the end of winter.\"\n\nEventually, the mid-October heat brought on the harvest slightly sooner than expected, with an expected yield of four tonnes of hay, slightly short of their 5-tonne target.\n\n\"Performance-wise, I think it's done pretty good, but we didn't know what to expect from it cause it hasn't been grown out here before,\" he said.\n\n\"It's probably not the best crop of barley, but it's something we can do with.\"\n\nSold quicker than grown\n\nMr Haigh said there was no shortage of buyers looking to get their hands on some of the hay, with droughts in the southern parts of Australia making farmers look as far north as Katherine for fodder to help feed livestock in 2025.\n\nBarley being harvested at Athelle Outback Hideaway.

    "text": "Long-term residents of Tasmanian caravan parks would get protections similar to other renters, such as a ban on no-grounds evictions and unlimited rent increases, draft legislation has revealed.\n\nThe proposed legislation also enshrines into law the right of park residents to sell their homes \u2014 an issue which is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe state government committed to regulating the residential use of caravan parks following a series of issues at the Beauty Point Tourist Park in northern Tasmania.\n\nIn February last year, the local council said the park was not actually approved for residential use, despite people having lived there for decades.\n\nA residents' association was formed, and the park later handed its president John Lowe an eviction notice. He fought the matter in the Supreme Court and won, but the park is appealing against the verdict.\n\nJohn Lowe in his caravan at the Beauty Point Tourist Park in northern Tasmania. (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough)\n\nThe government has now released the draft legislation for consultation, which would apply to residents who own their own homes in caravan parks and live there for 90 days or more per year.\n\nMr Lowe said on first reading of the draft legislation, he believed it would afford \"vital rights\" to residents.\n\n\"It finally provides long overdue legal certainty and protection that long-term residents have historically lacked,\" he said.\n\n\"It finally puts into legislation you have to have mandatory written agreements, guaranteed essential access, protection for quiet enjoyment, things like bond and rental security.\n\n\"It just gives back basic living standards that address a power imbalance that was often felt by the residents in these parks.\"\n\nRight to sell park homes\n\nRoslyn Grima had lived at the Beauty Point Tourist Park since purchasing a home there in 2012. (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough)\n\nRoslyn Grima was fighting in the Supreme Court for the right to sell her home at the Beauty Point Tourist Park to fund cancer treatment.\n\nThe park has banned on-site sales since the council said it was not approved for future residential use, arguing in court that it had the right to approve or reject sales.\n\nThe court granted Ms Grima a trial, but she died before it could begin. Now her children are continuing the case.\n\nThe government's draft legislation addresses the issue, stating residents can sell their homes on-site and park owners cannot hinder sales.\n\nIf a resident dies, the estate would be obliged to initially offer to sell the home to the park owner at market value.\n\nNo-grounds evictions for long-term residents banned\n\nKathleen Philp, 82, was issued an eviction notice. (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough)\n\nA number of residents at the Beauty Point Tourist Park have been issued with eviction notices in recent years \u2014 including 82-year-old Kathleen Philp, who refused to move her car to allow the park to demolish her driveway to make way for a walkway.\n\nMs Philp engaged a lawyer and a few weeks after she was issued the eviction notice, the park said she could return home. It said her future place in the park would be determined following the result of the appeal of Mr Lowe's case.\n\nAttempted eviction of caravan park resident ruled 'invalid' John planned to live out his days at a caravan park but was issued an eviction notice after nearly two years. He took the case to the Supreme Court which has ruled the eviction attempt \"invalid and of no effect\".\n\nThe draft legislation outlines the reasons residents can be terminated, such as if the park owner hands them a breach notice and they do not fix the breach within a specified period. They could also be evicted for successive breaches.\n\nPark owners could also terminate a resident's agreement for serious violence or serious misconduct.\n\nThe draft legislation prohibits no-grounds evictions for those on long-term fixed agreements \u2014 defined as five or more years \u2014 but those on periodic tenancies can be terminated with notice given.\n\nLimits on rent increases\n\nPeople who own their own homes at caravan parks typically pay rent and electricity fees to the park.\n\nResidents at the Beauty Point Tourist Park have previously raised concerns about rules the park introduced which stated rent could be increased at any time.\n\nThe park is home to around 60 residents who pay fortnightly site fees. (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough)\n\nThe draft legislation states caravan parks would only be able to increase the rent every 12 months and must provide at least 60 days' notice \u2014 the same rights afforded to renters under the Residential Tenancy Act.\n\nResidents would also have the power to challenge rent increases with the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (TASCAT), which could determine if the increase was excessive.\n\nTASCAT could also hear disputes on other matters, including termination notices and applications from a majority of residents to declare a park rule unreasonable and have it changed.\n\nBill details rights and obligations, Tenants Union says\n\nThe Tenants' Union of Tasmania has been calling for legislation to protect caravan park residents.\n\n\"People in this situation essentially have no clear rights or obligations at the moment,\" acting principal solicitor Alex Bomford said.\n\nHe said it would take time to go through the bill in detail, but said it seemed \"more modern\" than the Residential Tenancy Act which covers renters in Tasmania.\n\n\"There's a lot of process for dispute resolution, for instance,\" he said.\n\n\"It seems, at a high level, relatively detailed as to rights and obligations.\"\n\nMr Bomford would like clarity on whether people who rent their place from the caravan park, as opposed to owning it, would be covered by the legislation.\n\n\"It might be the case that those people are better suited to be covered by this bill rather than the Tenancy Act, and I don't think it's necessarily that clear that they are covered by the Tenancy Act at the moment,\" he said.\n\nHe would also like no-grounds evictions prohibited for all residents, not just those on long-term agreements.\n\nThe Tenants' Union plans to make a submission on the draft legislation.\n\nSubmissions are open until end of day February 8, 2026.",

Here are five films we wish were honoured at the time.\n\nLast year, it was announced Best Casting would begin to be awarded from 2026 due to casting directors' essential role in shaping films that reach the big screen.\n\nIn April, after years of impassioned calls, the Academy announced it will introduce a Best Stunt Design category, to be in place by the event's 100th anniversary in 2028.\n\nThe Oscars' telecast has been slimmed down since 2023, with eight categories \u2014 such as editing, production design, sound and makeup and hair styling \u2014 presented off-air.\n\nThis week, the Oscars shortlist was announced for 12 categories, unveiling a competitive field led by Warner Bros' Sinners and Universal's Wicked: For Good, which each landed eight mentions.\n\nThe Academy Award nominations will be announced on January 22.\n\nComedian Conan O'Brien will return to host the 98th ceremony, taking place on March 15.\n\nAP/AFP",

(Supplied: Southern Cross Gold)\n\nAt Sunday Creek, east of Kilmore and 60km north of Melbourne, Southern Cross Gold has ambitions to build a mine at the start of the next decade.\n\nSouthern Cross Gold president and CEO Michael Hudson said Fosterville Gold Mine's discovery of a high-grade gold mineralisation zone 10 years ago had \"reshaped the understanding of Victorian geology\".\n\n\"It wasn't just a wonderful fluke, now they're predictable and there's so much more to be found with that knowledge,\" Mr Hudson said.\n\n\"It's a Victorian renaissance without a doubt.\"\n\nSouthern Cross Gold said a Sunday Creek mine would only go ahead if it was economically viable and with further approvals.\n\nSouthern Cross Gold drill samples at Sunday Creek. (Supplied: Southern Cross Gold)\n\nDeeper look at Sunday Creek\n\nThe Sunday Creek site owned by Southern Cross Gold was mined between 1880 and 1920, but modern techniques have allowed for deeper exploration.\n\nMr Hudson said 100km worth of drilling \u2014 each about the circumference of a person's forearm \u2014 had delivered \"world-class\", \"very high-grade\" results over the past three years.\n\nMichael Hudson says the gold sector is in a renaissance in Victoria.

(ABC News: Tim Lee)\n\n\"What the success of Fosterville and the gold price has done is brought a lot more money in to look beneath our feet in Victoria,\" Mr Sorahan said.\n\nFosterville Gold Mine, 20km east of Bendigo, received Commonwealth approval, with strict environmental conditions, to expand its operations in November.\n\nNearby residents have complained of living with earthquakes, noise and dust from their mine neighbour.\n\nA state planning panel examining the expansion's potential environmental impacts heard it would boost the region's economy by $1.3 billion over the coming decade.",

She hopes to pursue family or international law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked really, really hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI would just say even if you go to a rural or disadvantaged school where students don\u2019t typically do well in the HSC, you still can.\u201d",

The brilliance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Will Sharpe), the prodigious composer who was the Lennon and the McCartney of the late 18th century, is a wellspring of revelation and inspiration. But for Mozart\u2019s lesser peer, Antonio Salieri (Paul Bettany), the blow-in\u2019s gifts create only agony and uncertainty. As with Timothee Chalamet\u2019s Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, genius demands cruel, cold sacrifice.\n\nWill Sharpe as Wolfgang \u201cAmadeus\u201d Mozart in Amadeus.\n\nLike the previous Amadeus, the Milos Forman movie that won Best Picture at the 1984 Academy Awards, this limited series was adapted from Peter Shaffer\u2019s 1979 play. Shaffer invented the rivalry between the two composers, but its mix of jealousy and longing feels authentic and contemporary. The blithely arrogant Mozart is a source of private torment to the established Salieri, culminating in the former\u2019s controversial death.\n\nThe tone is saucy, not stuffy. Party-boy Wolfgang has \u201ca few sharpeners\u201d before his 1781 Vienna debut for Emperor Joseph II (Rory Kinnear), while Salieri references an opera he \u201creleased\u201d; the British cast use their natural tones, avoiding Central European accents. Creator Joe Barton, fresh from the bloody espionage follies of Netflix\u2019s Black Doves, mixes black comedy and high anguish. He also carves out Mozart\u2019s wife, Constanze (Gabrielle Creevy), as a necessary alternate voice.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers has announced the Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, showing a $5.4 billion improvement to this year\u2019s deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Chalmers began with a tribute to those lost in the Bondi attack, announcing a $104 million contingency for security at Jewish sites and crisis services.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the focus shifted, the Treasurer claimed a fiscal \"triple crown.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this is the first mid-year update since the 90s to deliver a better bottom line, lower debt, and positive policy decisions all at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are strengthening the budget, we\u2019re reducing debt, we\u2019re delivering on our commitments... In fact, this is the only mid-year update since they began in the mid-90s to have a combination of these three features: a better bottom line each year of the forwards, less debt every year of the forwards, and net policy decisions that improve the bottom line.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the few standouts in the document is a $233 million lifeline for the CSIRO, framed as a proud investment in the nation's scientific future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, spending pressures are shifting.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildcare has jumped ahead of aged care in the list of the budget's biggest financial burdens, joining a \"top five\" of debt interest, defence, health, and the NDIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are pressures that Finance Minister Katy Gallagher says are increasing, not decreasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe payment variations were a big part of a lot of the work we had to deal with in finalizing MYEFO. A lot of that, obviously, are those demand driven programs, but also the increases in indexation of payments. So the age pension, for example, a big chunk in disaster relief funding because of the frequency and intensity of disasters that we're seeing. Extra money into schools veterans and we're seeing an uptake of access to childcare because of some of the changes we've made to early education and care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEven as the Treasurer celebrates the numbers, he says he is acutely aware of how inflation is impacting Australian households.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the last budget inflation has risen from 3 per cent to 3.75 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Chalmers acknowledges that this threatens to outpace wage growth, potentially leading to a \"real wage cut\" for millions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo we acknowledge, obviously, even with strong wages growth, when the inflation forecast ticks up, as we have presented in these documents, then that has implications for real wages. But overwhelmingly, the story of real wages under this government has been a story of real wages growth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there is the issue of Net Overseas Migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile arrivals are easing, Dr Chalmers says they aren't falling as fast as Treasury hoped.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is also backing its housing agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Chalmers says they are funding the promised 100,000 homes for first-home buyers and providing $98 million to fast-track construction trades.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to the budget, Shadow Finance Minister James Patterson says the Labor government has missed the opportunity to stop the uptick of inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe criticises the government for keeping what he calls reckless spending, saying Dr Chalmers and finance minister Katy Gallagher needs to be held responsible if interest rates rise again next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Albanese government has been warned by economists, business leaders and the Opposition that their reckless spending is driving up inflation. And now the inflation gini is well and truly out of the bottle. It's above the target band in headline, and in underlying terms, and it's forecasted to stay that way for sometime, which is why markets and so many economists are predicting inflation will rise and interets rate will have to as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Patterson says the Mid-Year Budget update shows the Albanese government has given up on balancing the budget in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Treasurer wants to claim credit today for his paltry $2 billion dollars of budget improvement over the forwards. But these improvements are in the out years, in the next two years, when inflation is above net target, his decision actually worsens the budget bottom line and put more pressure of inflation.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

She hopes to pursue family or international law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked really, really hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI would just say even if you go to a rural or disadvantaged school where students don\u2019t typically do well in the HSC, you still can.\u201d",

The brilliance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Will Sharpe), the prodigious composer who was the Lennon and the McCartney of the late 18th century, is a wellspring of revelation and inspiration. But for Mozart\u2019s lesser peer, Antonio Salieri (Paul Bettany), the blow-in\u2019s gifts create only agony and uncertainty. As with Timothee Chalamet\u2019s Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, genius demands cruel, cold sacrifice.\n\nWill Sharpe as Wolfgang \u201cAmadeus\u201d Mozart in Amadeus.\n\nLike the previous Amadeus, the Milos Forman movie that won Best Picture at the 1984 Academy Awards, this limited series was adapted from Peter Shaffer\u2019s 1979 play. Shaffer invented the rivalry between the two composers, but its mix of jealousy and longing feels authentic and contemporary. The blithely arrogant Mozart is a source of private torment to the established Salieri, culminating in the former\u2019s controversial death.\n\nThe tone is saucy, not stuffy. Party-boy Wolfgang has \u201ca few sharpeners\u201d before his 1781 Vienna debut for Emperor Joseph II (Rory Kinnear), while Salieri references an opera he \u201creleased\u201d; the British cast use their natural tones, avoiding Central European accents. Creator Joe Barton, fresh from the bloody espionage follies of Netflix\u2019s Black Doves, mixes black comedy and high anguish. He also carves out Mozart\u2019s wife, Constanze (Gabrielle Creevy), as a necessary alternate voice.",

They were followed by girls\u2019 schools Abbotsleigh, Ascham and Sydney Girls.",
