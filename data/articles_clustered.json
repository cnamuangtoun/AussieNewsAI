(Supplied/Reddit)\n\n\"Even the eSafety commissioner said the law's approach is not what she preferred. Many leading organisations and many of our own users have raised similar concerns.\n\n\"As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, 'There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights'.\n\n\"Lastly, this law is applied to Reddit inaccurately, since we're a forum primarily for adults and we don't have the traditional social media features the government has taken issue with.\"\ufeff\n\nThe company, which says it is complying with the ban, also pointed to the fact it had a 17-plus age rating on the Apple App store before the new laws came into effect \u2013 although it still has a 12-plus rating on the Google Play store.\n\nREAD MORE: Idyllic tourist hotspot introduces the death penalty for a common offence\n\nReddit is one of ten social media companies forced to keep young children off its platform under the ban.

(Supplied Nine)\n\n\"We've named not just individuals but also groups, more women than our founders could have imagined (though still not enough), and, on rare occasions, a concept: the endangered Earth, in 1988, or the personal computer, in 1982,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, the editor-in-chief, in an explanation of the choice.\n\n\"The drama surrounding the selection of the PC over Apple's Steve Jobs later became the stuff of books and a movie.\"\n\nOne of the cover images resembling the \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper\" photograph from the 1930s shows eight tech leaders sitting on the beam: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, AMD CEO Lisa Su, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the CEO of Google's DeepMind division Demis Hassabis, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, who launched her own start up World Labs last year.\n\nAnother cover image shows scaffolding surrounding the giant letters \"AI\" made to look like computer componentry.\n\nFive of the eight people selected \u2014 Musk, Zuckerberg, Huang, Altman and Su \u2014 are already billionaires with a collective fortune of $US870 billion, based on the latest estimates compiled by Forbes magazine. Much of the wealth has been accumulated during the past three years of AI fever.\n\nTime magazine chief executive Jessica Sibley, centre, rung the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, on Thursday, December 11, 2025 as the publication announced its Person of the Year. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (AP)\n\nIt made sense for Time to anoint AI because 2025 was the year that it shifted from \"a novel technology explored by early adopters to one where a critical mass of consumers see it as part of their mainstream lives,\" Thomas Husson, principal analyst at research firm Forrester, said by email.\n\nThe magazine noted AI company CEOs' attendance at US President Donald Trump's inauguration this year in Washington DC as a herald for the prominence of the sector.\n\n\"This was the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" Jacobs wrote.\n\nAI was a leading contender for the top slot, according to prediction markets, along with Huang and Altman. Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope whose election this year followed the death of Pope Francis, was also considered a contender, with Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani topping lists as well.\n\nThe magazine's selection dates from 1927, when its editors have picked the person they say most shaped headlines over the previous 12 months.",

    "text": "A Hollywood director has been convicted on charges that he scammed Netflix out of $US11 million ($16.5 million) for a show that never materialised.\n\nCarl Erik Rinsch, best known for directing the film 47 Ronin, instead used the cash for lavish purchases that included several Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari and about $US1 million in mattresses and luxury bedding, prosecutors said.\n\nRinsch was convicted of wire fraud, money laundering and other charges on Thursday, local time, according to court records and a spokesperson for federal prosecutors in New York.\n\nIn a statement, Rinsch's attorney, Benjamin Zeman, said he thought the verdict was wrong and \"could set a dangerous precedent for artists who become embroiled in contractual and creative disputes with their benefactors, in this case one of the largest media companies in the world, finding themselves indicted by the federal government for fraud\".\n\nHollywood director arrested for allegedly swindling Netflix out of $17 million Plus White Lotus star Jason Isaacs wades into prosthetic penis discourse, protesters interrupt Gal Gadot's walk of fame ceremony and more.\n\nProsecutors said Netflix had initially paid Rinsch about $US44 million for an unfinished sci-fi show called White Horse, then sent over another $US11 million after he said he needed additional funding to wrap up the production.\n\nBut instead of putting the money toward the show, Rinsch steered the cash to a personal account where he made a series of failed investments, losing around half of the $US11 million in a couple of months, according to prosecutors.\n\nHe then put the remaining funds into the cryptocurrency market, netting some profit, though Rinsch then deposited the money into his own bank account.\n\nThen came the lavish purchases, prosecutors said, with Mr Rinsch buying five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, along with $US652,000 on watches and clothes.\n\nHe also bought two mattresses for about $US638,000 and spent another $US295,000 on luxury bedding and linens.\n\nIn addition, he used some of the money to pay off about $US1.8 million in credit card bills, prosecutors said.\n\nRinsch, 48, never finished the show. His sentencing date is set for April.\n\nNetflix declined to comment.\n\nUS attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement to the Associated Press that Rinsch \"took $US11 million meant for a TV show and gambled it on speculative stock options and crypto transactions\".\n\n\"Today's conviction shows that when someone steals from investors, we will follow the money and hold them accountable.\"\n\nAP",

    "text": "Almost 102 years after ABC radio first hit the airwaves, Perth listeners will experience a major improvement in audio quality when the network's three AM stations move to FM in 2026.\n\nThe long-awaited shift follows a decision by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to vary the Perth and Remote Western Australia radio licence area plans.\n\nABC managing director Hugh Marks said it was an exciting opportunity to improve the quality of services to Perth audiences.\n\n\" We have long been aware of the challenges of AM reception in Perth. With FM, audiences can enjoy richer sound and more reliable broadcasts, ensuring they stay connected to the programs they love. \"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese speaks at ABC Radio Perth in November. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nABC director of audio Ben Latimer said not only would the move to FM significantly improve sound quality, it would also lead to considerable savings.\n\n\"These new FM licences will deliver better quality audio and are significantly less expensive; providing better value to taxpayers as demand for AM declines in capital cities,\" Mr Latimer said.\n\n\"This change reinforces the ABC's ongoing commitment to our radio services and our ongoing desire to provide the best quality broadcasts for audiences across the country.\"\n\nThe switchover date and new frequencies for ABC Radio Perth, Radio National and News Radio will be announced in the new year.\n\nWhy is AM reception in Perth a problem?\n\nThe answer lies in how amplitude modulation (AM) frequencies are transmitted and the bane of all Perth gardeners \u2014 Perth's sandy soil.\n\nFederal Opposition Leader Sussan Ley at ABC Radio Perth Studios on Drive. (ABC News: Kenith Png)\n\nWhile we refer to radio being on the airwaves, AM transmission relies on ground waves.\n\n\"AM operates from what's called a site and each site is located somewhere where there's good propagation, where the signal will travel the best,\" Gavin Bowman, ABC's manager of transmission contracts explained.\n\n\"AM travels better along the ground, and so therefore you need a site with good sort of ground propagation aspects.\n\n\" AM really likes moist, wet soil to go further, and so often you'll have an AM tower in a swamp or next to a river or something like that, where the ground is wet. \"\n\nAM transmitters rely on good soil conductivity to carry signals along the ground. In areas like Perth, dry, sandy soil and electrical infrastructure weaken signals over distance. (ABC Transmission)\n\nPerth sits on the Swan coastal plain, which is notorious for its dry, sandy soil and going months without any rain.\n\nAM needs a paddock in the city\n\nSince 1939 the ABC Radio Perth AM transmitter has been located on a large bushland reserve in Hamersley, in Perth's northern suburbs, with an exclusion zone around the 180-metre-high mast.\n\nUnlike FM which needs a tower or mast on a hill line-of-sight propagation, AM requires a lot more land.\n\n\"The reason for that is because [with AM] the mast that you can see at the centre of the site is only one little part of the overall infrastructure that gets the signal out,\" Mr Bowman said.\n\n\"One of the main parts is that they plough extra wires into the dirt, which make the transmitter what they call electrically longer.\n\n\"You have these radial wires that lead out from the mast that direct the signal out along the ground in a much more efficient way than just a mast would on its own.\n\n\"Because of that requirement, you have to have a really large block of land, we're talking about acres and acres and acres.\"\n\nFM transmitters are mounted high on ridges or towers. They use line-of-sight propagation to deliver wider, clearer coverage with less power and little dependence on soil conditions and are ideal for high quality audio across concentrated metro areas. (ABC Transmission)\n\nNot only does AM use up a lot of land in capital cities, one AM mast can only deliver one or two services, so each radio station needs its own paddock.\n\n\"In the case of FM and TV, they can all share the same infrastructure, so one site on top of a hill can house a large number of services,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a large sharing capacity where you can defray those costs across multiple services, which you can't do in AM.\"\n\nFreeway drives a train through car listening\n\nAs if the sand and the land weren't enough, the 1990s expansion of the Perth railway network, to run north and south along the centre of the Mitchell and Kwinana freeways, created another headache for AM radio listeners.\n\nA Transperth train on the Joondalup line. The electrified lines have made listening to AM radio in the car on the freeway difficult. (ABC News: Eliza Laschon)\n\nThe electrified train lines cause interference that makes listening to AM radio in the car while driving on the freeway almost impossible.\n\n\"Whenever a train goes past and you've got your AM radio tuned in, that is significant impact to your quality of service,\" Mr Bowman said.\n\nFor many commuters, the interference has led to a permanent switch-off of AM stations when they are on the freeway.\n\n101 years on the AM band\n\nIt is the end of an era for ABC Radio Perth (first named 6WF, then later 720), which started broadcasting just over a century ago on June 4, 1924.\n\nIt was not founded by the ABC, but was a commercial station operated by Westralian Farmers Co-operative (now Wesfarmers) with the intention of lessening isolation for people in the bush.\n\nABC Radio Perth marks 100 years The state's first AM radio station was founded by what's now known as Wesfarmers to help ease isolation in the bush. A century later, it's still bringing the community together.\n\nAccording to Wesfarmers' official history, the station came about after John Thomson, head of the wheat department of the company, was travelling on a rough dirt track in the wheatbelt, on his way to Bruce Rock, when his car got two flat tyres and he was forced to wait four hours for a passer-by to come and help.\n\nIt was during those four lonely hours that he reflected on the isolation people in the country experienced and decided wireless telegraphy [radio], which was just emerging in Australia, was the perfect solution.\n\nOperating a radio station was far from the organisation's usual business, but Mr Thomson was able to persuade management that Wesfarmers should bid for the first radio license in Perth.\n\nAn ABC Radio Perth Mornings Spotlight forum. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nThe station was named 6WF, for Wesfarmers. Four years later, weary of running a radio station, Wesfarmers sold 6WF to the Commonwealth government, and eventually it became part the ABC local radio network.\n\nMr Latimer confirmed the move to FM in Perth would not have an impact on the ABC's regional radio services nor the ABC's commitment to emergency broadcasting.\n\n\"The ABC is in the fortunate position of having existing high-powered AM transmitters in areas adjacent to Perth to provide emergency broadcasting to all areas outside the metropolitan area currently covered by the Perth AM signal,\" he said.",

    "text": "Reddit has filed a High Court challenge alleging that Australia's social media restrictions are being applied to the company inaccurately.\n\nThe company is currently complying with the legislation but has said the new law \"has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors\".\n\nThe day the snap streaks ended \u2014 for some teens, at least After a year of waiting, Australia's world-leading laws to block kids from accessing social media are officially enacted. But the teens they're meant to impact say not much has actually changed.\n\nReddit added the law was \"creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't\".\n\nIn response to Reddit's legal challenge, the Albanese government said it was \"on the side of Australian parents and kids, not platforms\".\n\n\"We will stand firm to protect young Australians from experiencing harm on social media,\" a government spokesperson said.\n\n\"The matter is before the courts, so it is not appropriate to comment further.\"\n\nIn a statement, Reddit said the case was not an attempt to avoid compliance and it would continue to comply and engage with the government regulator.\n\n\"We believe there are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth, and the SMMA law carries some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet,\" Reddit said in the court filing.\n\n\" This law is applied to Reddit inaccurately, since we're a forum primarily for adults and we don't have the traditional social media features the government has taken issue with. \"\n\nReddit is one of 10 platforms included in Australia's world-first social media ban for children under 16.\n\nTo avoid Australia's new age limit laws, a platform must come under an exempt class, which includes messaging, email, voice or video calling, online games, health, education and professional development.\n\nReddit said \"this is also not an effort to retain young users for business reasons\".\n\nThe social media platform said it did not \"market or target advertising to children under 18\", saying that under-16s were \"not a substantial market segment for Reddit and we don't intend them to be\".\n\nBan is not 'reasonably appropriate and adapted'\n\nIn its filing, Reddit says the government's social media ban has not been well adapted to cater for all platforms affected.\n\nReddit say the social media ban is applied inaccurately. ( )\n\nThe company says the only obligation imposed on platforms relating to the restriction of access to under-16s is to \"take reasonable steps to prevent age-restricted users having accounts\".\n\nReddit argues the Amendment Act \"does not impose any obligation on providers to restrict access to content on the site that is accessible without an account\".\n\nIt says the memorandum provided by the government states the \"obligation would not affect user access to 'logged-out' versions of a social media platform\".\n\nReddit says it is one such platform where users can access content without an account.\n\nBanned: TikTok TikTok logo TikTok is used to create, share and discover short videos, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance. Before the ban, the eSafety Commission said there were about 200,000 Australian users aged 13 to 15, among a total of almost 10 million Australian accounts. While TikTok has its own minimum age of 13, the regulator has found it's one of the most popular platforms for users aged between eight and 12 as well. The platform's Australia policy lead, Ella Woods-Joyce, said TikTok would comply with the ban, but warned it could have unintended consequences.\n\n\n\n\"Experts believe a ban will push younger people into darker corners of the internet where protections don't exist,\" Ms Woods-Joyce said. Banned: Instagram Instagram logo Instagram was the most used app among Australian teenagers aged 13 to 17 with more than a million monthly active users in this age cohort, according to the eSafety Commission. The platform is owned by Meta, which also owns Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Messenger. Instagram said its \"teen accounts\" were automatically applied to users aged 13 to 17, which came with built-in limits on who can contact them and filters on \"sensitive content\". Users in this age cohort also received notifications prompting them to leave the app after 60 minutes of use in one day. Despite these measures, Instagram is under Australia's social media ban for under-16s. Banned: Snapchat Snapchat logo Snapchat was also among the most popular apps for young people, with more than a million of its 8.3 million Australian users aged 17 or under. Snapchat is a messaging app that allows users to send images, videos and texts that are only available for a short period once they're opened. Users can also choose to share their location with friends on Snap Map. Snapchat sought to allow underage users to download and archive their data before their accounts were disabled. Banned: YouTube YouTube logo YouTube has been one of the most popular online platforms for young Australians, with more than 643,000 users aged 17 and under. The regulator found it was the top platform for users aged between eight and 12, with more than two-thirds of those surveyed picking it as their platform of choice. The Australian government was planning to exempt YouTube from its social media ban, but later backflipped on this decision. Rachel Lord from YouTube Australia and New Zealand says there's substantial evidence that YouTube is widely used in classrooms and supported by parents. \"YouTube is not a social media platform; it is a video streaming platform with a library of free, high-quality content, and TV screens are increasingly the most popular place to watch,\" she said. YouTube Kids, a filtered version of the platform that allows parents to create accounts for children under 12, is still allowed. Banned: Facebook The Facebook logo. While Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube dominated for young social media users, Facebook still had an estimated 455,000 Australian users aged between 13 and 17. The platform is owned by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta and already has a minimum age of 13. Meta policy director Mia Garlick recently told a Senate hearing that the company would comply with the ban but was still solving \"numerous challenges\" to identify teenagers' accounts. Facebook's private messaging service Messenger is still allowed. Banned: Twitch Twitch logo. ( ) Streaming platform Twitch was added to the list of banned apps after the eSafety Commission found it has the sole or significant purpose of online social interaction. \"Twitch is a platform most commonly used for live streaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted,\" a statement posted to the eSafety website said. Twitch is mainly used by gaming and eSport players to broadcast their gameplay with audio commentary, but it's also used to share and broadcast music, live sports, and food programs, according to the regulator. Banned: X X logo Formerly known as Twitter and owned by billionaire Elon Musk, X falls under the list of banned platforms for under-16s. While it wasn't among the most popular apps for young users, the eSafety Commission has concerns about the prevalence of \"online hate\" on the platform. In June 2023, the regulator said it had received more complaints about online hate on X in the past 12 months than any other platform, saying X had \"dropped the ball on tackling hate\". Banned: Reddit Reddit logo Messaging board Reddit, the seventh-most visited site in the world, is on the list of age-restricted platforms. The platform bans mature content until a user declares they are 18 or over, however, there was no age verification system in place, according to the eSafety Commission. The platform has said it would comply with the ban, but disagreed with the \"scope, effectiveness and privacy implications\" of the law. Banned: Kick Kick logo Along with Reddit, Kick was a late addition to the government's list of age-restricted platforms. Kick is an Australian competitor to video live streaming platform Twitch, where users can watch live video streams covering games, music and gambling. The eSafety Commission recently suggested Twitch, along with gaming site Roblox, could also soon fall under the ban. Banned: Threads Threads logo Threads is a microblogging platform similar to X, which requires users to have an Instagram account for access. As Instagram is banned for under 16s, Threads also falls under the list of banned platforms.\n\nReddit not 'social'\n\nIn one part of the court filing, Reddit references the Oxford and Macquarie Dictionary's definition of the word social.\n\nReddit argues that the government's new ban focuses on the word social and online social interaction, which is not the \"sole or a significant\" purpose of the platform.\n\n\"Reddit enables online interactions about the content that users post on the site. It facilitates knowledge sharing from one user to other users,\" the filing states.\n\n\"It is not a significant purpose of the site to enable interactions engaged in because of a particular user's relationship with or interest in another user as a person; indeed, in most cases, the identity of a user on Reddit is not even known to other users.\"\n\nThe platform goes on to say it does not import contact lists, and its upvote/downvote function is to allow users to indicate how helpful information is, not as a way to be social.\n\n\"In this way, Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become 'friends' with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events,\" the company said.",

    "text": "Tony Popovic has unwittingly become public enemy number one for USA soccer great Landon Donovan, who labelled the Socceroos coach \"smug\" and predicted Australia to crash out of the World Cup.\n\nThe Socceroos will play co-hosts the USA, Paraguay and a European play-off qualifier in group D in next year's finals, after dodging big guns Argentina, Spain, France and England in the draw.\n\nSpeaking immediately after the draw, Popovic said he was \"satisfied\" with Australia's group.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThat comment seemingly drew the ire of former star striker Donovan.\n\n\"I watched the Aussie coach's interview after the draw and it was really interesting,\" Donovan said on Fox Sports.\n\n\"It was unique. Because most coaches say all the same stuff you're expecting like, 'Oh, it's a difficult draw, this is going to be so hard \u2014 and his first comment was: 'we're satisfied'.\n\n\"And I was like: 'Really? Are you?'\n\nLandon Donovan is arguably considered America's greatest ever men's player and played in three World Cups. (Getty Images: Victor Decolongon)\n\n\"And he just had this smugness about him and I'm like, 'Alright, I can't wait. I wish I was on the field \u2014 like, I wanna play these guys.'\n\n\"They're a solid team, they're hard to play against, this is not going to be some blowout, whatever, but it's a team I think we should beat.\"\n\nDonovan then doubled down in the segment, with fellow ex-USA players Cobi Jones and Brad Guzan.\n\nHe predicted the USA to top the group, yet-to-qualify Turkey to come second and Paraguay to finish third \u2014 with Australia fourth.\n\n\"Thanks for coming, Aussies and your smug coach \u2014 you can get back on the Qantas airplane and head back home, pal,\" he quipped.\n\nDonovan isn't the first US pundit to write off the Australians, or consider the group an easy one for the locals.\n\nOn the day of the draw, former US player Alexi Lalas said: \"If you believe in the soccer gods, you should be thanking them.\n\nSocceroos dodge a bullet in World Cup draw but it won't be easy to progress Nothing can be guaranteed in a World Cup, but the Socceroos' draw alongside the United States, Paraguay and a European qualifier gives a solid shot at advancing, with the Australians avoiding most of the big names.\n\n\"I don't want to say it's an easy group, but we also have to be realistic with what we got here.\"\n\nCBS pundit Mike Grellas described the Australia fixture as a \"lay-up\" while former international Charlie Davies called the group \"a dream scenario\".\n\nAt the time, Popovic was unsurprised by local pundits backing their team but made it clear the Socceroos believed they could get through the group stage and could head with a lot of optimism and confidence.\n\n\"Anyone that underestimates us, I think will get a rude shock when it comes to those group games,\" he said last Saturday.\n\nThe Socceroos suffered a 2-1 loss to the USA in a spiteful friendly in October.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "WA's peak planning body has approved a development application for a controversial ferry terminal and jetty at Matilda Bay in Perth's western suburbs, despite receiving hundreds of public submissions and mounting opposition.\n\nThe Western Australian Planning Commission (WAPC) approved the site, along with another terminal at Applecross in Perth's south, at a public meeting in Floreat lasting nearly five hours on Thursday afternoon and attended by about 100 interested parties.\n\nProtesters gathered outside the meeting in Floreat to voice their anger and concerns. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nThe Metronet project will connect services from Matilda Bay and Applecross to a floating pontoon at Elizabeth Quay, but criticism against the $29.9 million Matilda Bay site in particular has drawn mounting public backlash.\n\nThe decision comes after WA's environmental regulator last month decided not to conduct a formal assessment of the government's plan.\n\nAn artist's impression of the proposed Applecross ferry terminal. (Supplied: WA Planning Commission)\n\n'We have listened': premier\n\nThe Matilda Bay jetty will extend 140 metres into the bay to accommodate multiple electric ferries.\n\nIt forms part of the government's plans to expand ferry services on the Swan River in what's been dubbed \"an exciting new chapter in public transport for WA\".\n\nThe Matilda Bay jetty will extend 140 metres into the bay, as illustrated in this rendering. (Supplied: WA Planning Commission)\n\n\"We have listened to the community and significantly shifted the position of that particular landing platform [at Matilda Bay],\" Premier Roger Cook said on Thursday.\n\n\"But it's an important part of our network, and we understand that when you make these decisions \u2014 decisions that are in the interest of the broader community \u2014 sometimes some sectors of the community don't agree with it, but that's what government is about.\"\n\nThe proposal has been met with criticism from several sailing and recreation groups, including Royal Perth Yacht Club, Safety on Swan, and Sailability WA.\n\nCommunity divided over Perth ferry stop As the WA government attempts to create \"Metronet on the Swan\" using electric ferries, campaigners want the Matilda Bay terminal moved south.\n\nMany have raised safety concerns about the site's location in close proximity to a number of sailing, rowing, fishing and swimming activities.\n\nLocals worried about impact\n\nNedlands local Judi Wilson, who attended the meeting and a snap protest outside, said the Matilda Bay site posed environmental risks.\n\n\"I've investigated the wave wash, the sea grass beds, the whole environmental impact and the fact that in talking to people on the bay \u2026 they just love that space,\" she said.\n\nNedlands resident Judi Wilson is among those opposed to the Matilda Bay ferry terminal. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nNedlands Liberal MLA Jonathan Huston also joined protesters to call for the site to be moved to nearby Jojo's Jetty to mitigate impacts.\n\n\"Jojo's is 150 metres away from the Purple Cat bus, which does a turnaround in front of Steve's Hotel,\" he said.\n\n\"So if you're 150 metres away from the Purple Cat bus at Jojo's, you're connected to the bus network system.\"\n\nNedlands Liberal MLA Jonathan Huston says the proposed terminal should be moved. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nHis position was contrary to the premier's, who said the Jojo's site \"doesn't make sense from a public transport accessibility point of view\".\n\nThe WAPC received 1,884 submissions during recent public consultation about the Matilda Bay site, with a large portion completely against the proposal.\n\nSeveral members at the public meeting called out while Public Transport Authority (PTA) officials gave one of their addresses.\n\nDozens of people attended the WA Planning Commission meeting about the ferry terminals. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nOne woman was asked to leave after yelling, \"Will you arrest me?\" leading to the meeting being adjourned for 15 minutes.\n\nFacilitators told the group the WAPC held the meeting \"in good faith\" and mentioned several times \"it's not a public town hall meeting\".\n\nMatilda Bay 'best overall': PTA\n\nMany of the submissions read out raised concerns about the social and environmental impacts.\n\nFerries currently operate on the Swan River between Elizabeth Quay and South Perth. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nThe PTA told the meeting five sites were assessed along with Matilda Bay, including Jojo's Jetty, with Central Matilda Bay deemed \"the best overall\".\n\nA representative said ongoing engagement with local groups would continue but noted a risk assessment at Jojo's Jetty was deemed \"not acceptable\".\n\nCriticism of the planned $29.9 million Matilda Bay terminal has drawn mounting public backlash. (Supplied: WA Planning Commission)\n\nThey also pointed towards the EPA's non-referral but said environmental impacts would continue to be worked through.\n\nServices on stage one of the expanded ferry network plan, going to Matilda Bay and Applecross, are expected to begin by the end of 2027.\n\nThe terminal at Applecross has also been approved by the Western Australian Planning Commission.

Just about any chef will tell you it\u2019s the freshness of the bread. And as far as Tim Glasson is concerned, it doesn\u2019t get much fresher than pizza dough freshly baked from the oven. Olli Italiano\u2019s Panuozzo are huge, and therefore excellent value. Morgan Roberts \u201cWe stretch and bake the dough to order, so it literally can\u2019t be more fresh,\u201d Glasson says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of the appeal of what we do.\u201d But what does this have to do with sandwiches? Let us tell you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEver heard of panuozzo? Glasson is talking about panuozzo, a \u201cpizza sandwich\u201d that emerged in Naples in the 1980s. It takes pizza dough, bakes it and shapes it into a sandwich stuffed with fillings. Related Article These are the top 10 wine lists in south-east Queensland right now The traditional way (although we\u2019re talking the \u201980s here, so \u201ctradition\u201d is perhaps a relative term) to make panuozzo is to shape a typical Neapolitan pizza dough into an elongated roll, par-bake it, and then slice it open like a pita and stuff it full of ingredients, before giving it a second bake. The other way is more of a pizza wrap, where the cook stretches the dough, fills with hot ingredients, folds it for baking, and then reopens to add any cold ingredients before serving to the diner. This is what we\u2019re talking about here, in East Brisbane, at Olli Italiano.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlli Italiano\u2019s very Instagrammable lunch menu Olli Italiano is the product of Glasson and his partner, Anna Brobjer, who opened this cute as a button Italian restaurant in January. It sits on the corner of Lytton Road and Latrobe Street, an eye-catching bolthole presented in a smart white and scarlet paint job. Olli Italiano is a charming little restaurant in East Brisbane. Morgan Roberts Olli\u2019s usual fare is keenly priced, homey pasta and pizza fronted by a menu of smaller plates such as meatballs, deep-fried lasagne and burrata. But Glasson and Brobjer wanted a way to make lunch more approachable for locals, hence the February-March (Glasson can\u2019t remember exactly when) launch of a short menu of panuozzo. \u201cWe wanted something that people could come down and grab regularly, either in the restaurant or takeaway,\u201d Glasson says. \u201cAnd then we came across the idea off panuozzo and thought, \u2018This is just perfect\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlli Italiano\u2019s mortadella panuozzo There are six panuozzo on the menu. Glasson says the Diavola Dreams (tomato, fior di latte, rocket, nduja, hot salami, basil) and the Meatballs My Dear (pomodoro sauce, rocket, meatballs, shaved Parmesan, basil) are the bestsellers, but for us they play second (and third) fiddle to the first sanger on the list: the Mortadella Mi Bella. There\u2019s a bunch of panuozzo on the lunch menu, but this mortadella number is the pick. Morgan Roberts Like so many great sandwiches, its beauty is in its simplicity.

    "text": "The incident went viral, as these things tend to, and for the last week, Manson has been the subject of intense scrutiny from the media. Her subsequent attempts to explain herself have not been particularly well-received. In the court of public opinion, Shirley Manson has been found guilty of d---head behaviour.\n\nOn the scale of one to truly egregious festival behaviour, this does not rate especially high \u2013 but for whatever reason, on this particular day, Garbage frontwoman Shirley Manson was incensed by it. She singled the man out . She called his actions disrespectful. She insulted his hat (\u201cridiculous\u201d). She commented on the size of his penis (\u201csmall\u201d).\n\nTo begin with, some backstory. On December 5, Garbage appeared at Good Things, the alternative music festival held annually in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Sometime during Garbage\u2019s set, a festival-goer started tossing around an oversized, inflatable beach ball.\n\nAll of this is to say that the atmosphere going into the band\u2019s headline show was slightly tense. Was Manson\u2019s mood still sour? Would she \u2013 as Ryan Adams did a few months ago \u2013 write off her entire Australian fanbase? With the show at the Palais Theatre, one of the city\u2019s few coastal live music venues, would the mere proximity to the beach trigger a stress response? And most urgently: would anyone try to smuggle in a beach ball?\n\nNo one tried to smuggle in a beach ball at Garbage\u2019s Melbourne concert. Credit: Richard Clifford\n\nGarbage takes to the stage like a band that has something to prove. Manson performs with simmering, volatile energy, belting out songs from the recently released Let All That We Imagine Be the Light and hits from the band\u2019s extensive back-catalogue (#1 Crush, Stupid Girl, Only Happy When It Rains) with equal aplomb.\n\nShe briefly addresses the media storm \u2013 saying that everything has context, that she has nothing but love for the true fans, and that she stands by her stance on beach balls \u2013 then moves on. What matters tonight is the music.\n\nOf course, the fans who attend headline shows are a different breed than those drawn to the festival circuit. They are here for this band, this music. No one is here to undermine a singer who has had to endure sexism, ageism, gruelling tour conditions, dwindling remuneration, increasing competition from AI-generated music and crippling, performance-induced injuries. The mood is generously supportive. There\u2019s not a beach ball in sight.",

There are now over 3,000 Australians who are stuck in hospital waiting for federal aged care beds don't need to be in hospital. That's an absolute tragedy for those 3000 Australians that they're effectively homeless, stuck in our hospital system. It is also awful for other patients who need a hospital system for emergency care where there's both beds aren't available.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nA tanker seized by US forces off the coast of Venezuela will be taken to a United States port so its cargo of oil can be confiscated.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says a US investigative team is currently onboard questioning the crew, as the US follows its forfeiture procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the Justice Department obtained a warrant to take the tanker because they identified it as a vessel previously sanctioned for transporting Iranian oil on the black market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Trump administration is executing on the President's sanction policies and the sanction policies of the United States and we're not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narco-terrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nDozens of people have reportedly been killed in an airstrike on a hospital in Myanmar's western Rakhine state.\n\n\n\n\n\nRebel Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thu Kha says the hospital in the Mrauk U township was directly hit in the strike by Myanmar's ruling junta, completely destroying the facility and killing at least 30 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk has said in a statement that such attacks may amount to a war crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's calling for an investigation into what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales government and opposition have finally struck a deal on changes to the state's workers compensation scheme, ending a months-long impasse.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 3.6 million workers in New South Wales are covered by the state-owned insurer, which services both the public and private sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Daniel Mookhey had argued reform was necessary to keep the scheme sustainable, with psychological claims making up 12 per cent of workers' compensation claims and 38 per cent of the total cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the agreement means no-one will be worse off - and the government can do more to prevent injuries in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since this reform has begun we have passed the biggest shakeup to workplace health and safety laws in a generation. We've paired it with the biggest investment in workplace injury prevention for psychological injury in NSW history. And today we can confirm a compromise has been reached that will allow us to stabilise the workers compensation system as we get on with the job of making sure it remains fit for purpose.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour men have been accused of orchestrating a daring heist in the ACT that netted an estimated $10 million worth of items.\n\n\n\n\n\nACT Police allege the four French nationals meticulously planned the daring robbery of the South Canberra home after arriving in the country on October 7, with one allegedly hiring a rental car that was seen numerous times in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective Assistant Inspector Mark Battye says the group allegedly stole items that included precious jewellery, rare watches, and luxury handbags.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it was a targeted and highly unusual raid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been doing this job for a long time. I've never seen a burglary of this magnitude occur here in Canberra. And the manner in which it occurred with people flying over from the other side of the world to do this targeted burglary is something like a movie. It's certainly something we don't see too often.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport,\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African opener Quinton de Kock has helped his team restore some pride in a 51-run win over India in the second T20 international.\n\n\n\n",

Just about any chef will tell you it\u2019s the freshness of the bread. And as far as Tim Glasson is concerned, it doesn\u2019t get much fresher than pizza dough freshly baked from the oven. Olli Italiano\u2019s Panuozzo are huge, and therefore excellent value. Morgan Roberts \u201cWe stretch and bake the dough to order, so it literally can\u2019t be more fresh,\u201d Glasson says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of the appeal of what we do.\u201d But what does this have to do with sandwiches? Let us tell you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEver heard of panuozzo? Glasson is talking about panuozzo, a \u201cpizza sandwich\u201d that emerged in Naples in the 1980s. It takes pizza dough, bakes it and shapes it into a sandwich stuffed with fillings. Related Article These are the top 10 wine lists in south-east Queensland right now The traditional way (although we\u2019re talking the \u201980s here, so \u201ctradition\u201d is perhaps a relative term) to make panuozzo is to shape a typical Neapolitan pizza dough into an elongated roll, par-bake it, and then slice it open like a pita and stuff it full of ingredients, before giving it a second bake. The other way is more of a pizza wrap, where the cook stretches the dough, fills with hot ingredients, folds it for baking, and then reopens to add any cold ingredients before serving to the diner. This is what we\u2019re talking about here, in East Brisbane, at Olli Italiano.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlli Italiano\u2019s very Instagrammable lunch menu Olli Italiano is the product of Glasson and his partner, Anna Brobjer, who opened this cute as a button Italian restaurant in January. It sits on the corner of Lytton Road and Latrobe Street, an eye-catching bolthole presented in a smart white and scarlet paint job. Olli Italiano is a charming little restaurant in East Brisbane. Morgan Roberts Olli\u2019s usual fare is keenly priced, homey pasta and pizza fronted by a menu of smaller plates such as meatballs, deep-fried lasagne and burrata. But Glasson and Brobjer wanted a way to make lunch more approachable for locals, hence the February-March (Glasson can\u2019t remember exactly when) launch of a short menu of panuozzo. \u201cWe wanted something that people could come down and grab regularly, either in the restaurant or takeaway,\u201d Glasson says. \u201cAnd then we came across the idea off panuozzo and thought, \u2018This is just perfect\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlli Italiano\u2019s mortadella panuozzo There are six panuozzo on the menu. Glasson says the Diavola Dreams (tomato, fior di latte, rocket, nduja, hot salami, basil) and the Meatballs My Dear (pomodoro sauce, rocket, meatballs, shaved Parmesan, basil) are the bestsellers, but for us they play second (and third) fiddle to the first sanger on the list: the Mortadella Mi Bella. There\u2019s a bunch of panuozzo on the lunch menu, but this mortadella number is the pick. Morgan Roberts Like so many great sandwiches, its beauty is in its simplicity. There\u2019s mortadella supplied by Selecta Food Group that\u2019s made by an Italian family in Melbourne, a fistful of springy rocket, gooey stracciatella from Byron Bay Mozzarella, and then a liberal sprinkle of pistachio, as much for texture as it is flavour. Simple, except it\u2019s wrapped inside an almighty pizza base made with Italian 00 flour, filled with fior di latte and cooked fast at 350 degrees in the drop-door pizza oven out back, to produce a bubbly, crispy Neapolitan-ish crust. It\u2019s then finished with a generous sprinkle of pecorino for a bit of seasoning. And that\u2019s it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlli Italiano co-owner Anna Brobjer. Morgan Roberts It makes for a luscious, deeply satisfying sandwich that\u2019s as big as your face, yet easy to eat with one hand (after the chefs cut it in two, at least). I test this by demolishing it in the car on the way back to the office, rushing to address a deadline, conducting an interview on the way. There was hardly anything left for my coworkers upon my arrival. Sorry, gang. Where to get it The Mortadella Mi Bella is $17, making it crazy good value.

    "text": "The incident went viral, as these things tend to, and for the last week, Manson has been the subject of intense scrutiny from the media. Her subsequent attempts to explain herself have not been particularly well-received. In the court of public opinion, Shirley Manson has been found guilty of d---head behaviour.\n\nOn the scale of one to truly egregious festival behaviour, this does not rate especially high \u2013 but for whatever reason, on this particular day, Garbage frontwoman Shirley Manson was incensed by it. She singled the man out . She called his actions disrespectful. She insulted his hat (\u201cridiculous\u201d). She commented on the size of his penis (\u201csmall\u201d).\n\nTo begin with, some backstory. On December 5, Garbage appeared at Good Things, the alternative music festival held annually in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Sometime during Garbage\u2019s set, a festival-goer started tossing around an oversized, inflatable beach ball.\n\nAll of this is to say that the atmosphere going into the band\u2019s headline show was slightly tense. Was Manson\u2019s mood still sour? Would she \u2013 as Ryan Adams did a few months ago \u2013 write off her entire Australian fanbase? With the show at the Palais Theatre, one of the city\u2019s few coastal live music venues, would the mere proximity to the beach trigger a stress response? And most urgently: would anyone try to smuggle in a beach ball?\n\nNo one tried to smuggle in a beach ball at Garbage\u2019s Melbourne concert. Credit: Richard Clifford\n\nGarbage takes to the stage like a band that has something to prove. Manson performs with simmering, volatile energy, belting out songs from the recently released Let All That We Imagine Be the Light and hits from the band\u2019s extensive back-catalogue (#1 Crush, Stupid Girl, Only Happy When It Rains) with equal aplomb.\n\nShe briefly addresses the media storm \u2013 saying that everything has context, that she has nothing but love for the true fans, and that she stands by her stance on beach balls \u2013 then moves on. What matters tonight is the music.\n\nOf course, the fans who attend headline shows are a different breed than those drawn to the festival circuit. They are here for this band, this music. No one is here to undermine a singer who has had to endure sexism, ageism, gruelling tour conditions, dwindling remuneration, increasing competition from AI-generated music and crippling, performance-induced injuries. The mood is generously supportive. There\u2019s not a beach ball in sight.",

It's the test case for whether Australia is serious about having a manufacturing future.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after a flurry of deals struck by the federal government to keep smelters running across the nation as rising energy costs threatened their sustainability.\n\nIn October, the federal and Queensland governments agreed on a $600 million joint support package for a copper smelter in Mt Isa.\n\nA few months prior, the Commonwealth, South Australian and Tasmanian governments stumped up $135 million in taxpayer funds to keep Nyrstar lead and zinc smelters operating, with part of the funding going to expand production into critical minerals such as antimony.\n\nRio Tinto has been contacted for comment.",
