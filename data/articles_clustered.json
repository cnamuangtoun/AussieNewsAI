    "text": "Exclusive: Ren Pedersen's daughter, Amy, loved ballet and would run like the wind, with her strawberry-blonde hair flying behind her.\n\nNot long before she was diagnosed with a DIPG brain tumour - known as the deadliest childhood cancer - the seven-year-old won an interschool sprint race.\n\nThe first sign that something was wrong came when she started tripping over her feet, Pedersen said.\n\nAmy loved ballet and was an athletics champion. (Supplied)\n\n\"She said, 'Dad, it's these thongs', so I was chasing footwear,\" said the crane driver from Townsville.\n\n\"Then she started turning her head, and she was having little funny eye episodes,\" Pedersen said.\n\nPedersen took his daughter to an ophthalmologist, who told them to get to a doctor straight away.\n\n\"She didn't elaborate, but we found out soon after that Amy's ophthalmologist had lost both of her children to brain cancer,\" Pedersen said.\n\nWith no cure for the aggressive cancer, and limited treatment options, most children with DIPG die within a year.\n\nHaving caught the tumour relatively early, Amy managed to live for 16 more months, before she died, aged 9, in 2009.\n\nFor years after her death, Pedersen would find heartwrenchingly sweet handwritten notes Amy had left for him around the house.\n\nREAD MORE: Steve donated his kidney to a stranger and set an Australian record\n\nRen Pedersen's daughter Amy died in 2009, aged 9. Pictured at right is one of the many notes from Amy that Pedersen found after her death. (Supplied)\n\n\"They would say things like, 'Don't give up, Dad',\" he said.\n\n\"She'd hide them in between a pair of shorts or something like that.\"\n\nThe notes tracked the progression of Amy's illness as she lost the ability to write with her right hand and had to relearn the skill with her left.\n\n\"There were dozens of notes,\" he said.\n\n\"I get them out every now and again, but I can't lie to you, they're very hard to read.\"\n\nLosing Amy galvanised Pedersen into action, inspiring him to fight for a cure for DIPG.\n\nHaving no medical background proved to be somewhat of an advantage for Pedersen, who simply jumped right in, approaching Australia's leading oncologists and neurosurgeons he had come to know well during Amy's illness.\n\n\"I used these personal connections and I asked, once my daughter passed away, 'What would you do? What can I do as a father to empower you to save these kids in the future?'\" Pedersen said.\n\n\"The first thing we needed was autopsy samples. So I had parents approach me with children with terminal illness, and we created protocols that could debulk or remove the tumours from these deceased children.\"\n\nRen Pedersen, pictured with his daughter Amy, and (right) more of the notes she left for him in their home. (Supplied)\n\nWith the help of Pedersen's connections, the Children's Cancer Institute established Australia's first-ever tumour bank for DIPG in 2011, led by Associate Professor David Ziegler \u2013 a paediatric oncologist at Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, as well as a cancer researcher at the Institute.\n\nResearch into DIPG has come a long way in the past 15 years, with significant breakthroughs made by Australian researchers.\n\nIn 2021, research from Ziegler's team was published showing the tantalising potential of a revolutionary drug combination.\n\nPre-clinical testing in mouse models showed impressive results, with the promising drug combination leading to survival in two-thirds of the mice.\n\nIn March this year, another Australian-led study investigating incurable brain cancers, including DIPG, was published.\n\nThe study of 252 patients, 153 of whom had DIPG, revealed that 7.5 percent of the children had important changes in cancer predisposition genes, including the BRCA gene, best known for its association with breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nFor the first time, the research showed the tumours could develop because of underlying germline variants. The study may have major therapeutic implications and help researchers understand how the tumours begin and how they might be treated.\n\nHowever, the challenge remains to bridge the gap between groundbreaking research and accessible treatments.\n\n\"What we've got to do is get these treatments to the bedsides of the children,\" Pedersen said.\n\nWith this core aim in mind, Pedersen - who has received an Order of Australia medal for his work - launched \" Ren's Million Dollar Mission \" last November.\n\nThe mission aims to raise one million dollars for the Children's Cancer Institute , with Pedersen vowing to seek out 1000 individuals or companies who could each donate $1000.\n\n\"It's quite a daunting thing,\" Pedersen said.\n\n\"I'm in a town that's just been smashed by floods. It's had the toughest year. But I thought, surely there's got to be 1000 people across Australia with $1000 who can tap on a credit card.\n\nSo far, Pedersen has raised $110,000 in Townsville alone. He is now casting his net wider and taking his mission to the bigger cities, visiting Sydney next week.",

Sure, it helps that it has the strength of the Elder Scrolls IP \u2014 but often online games like these need so much more to lean on.\n\nThere's new content updates out now and plenty more on the way. So to get caught up, I sat down with Rich Lambert, the Game Director of The Elder Scrolls Online .\n\nEarly concept art for The Elder Scrolls Online. (Supplied)\n\nThe journey of The Elder Scrolls Online has been a long one, predating its 2014 launch.\n\nThe studio itself was founded in 2007, and work on the game's lore and setting began almost immediately.\n\nZeniMax Online Studios opened the vault for us to a few early concept pieces from the game.\n\nWith stunning landscapes, weapon design and architecture \u2014 it's clear how far the game has come.\n\nArchitecture concept art for The Elder Scrolls Online.

The players are exceedingly smart and resourceful and will always find a way to do something,\" Lambert said.\n\nUnderstanding how players actually play the game is crucial. For Lambert and his team, it shapes how they approach the game's design.\n\n\"When we first launched ESO, we were trying to find this kind of happy medium between MMO and Elder Scrolls, and we tried to walk that line in there and appeal to everybody. And we didn't really hit either side particularly well,\" he explained.\n\nEmperor Armour concept art.

    "text": "Five tunnels burrowing into a group of mountains, a large support structure and a wide security perimeter: that's all you can see of Iran's mysterious Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant from recent satellite imagery.\n\nThe secretive, heavily guarded complex built close to the holy city of Qom has been fuelling speculation about its true nature and size since it was first made public in 2009.\n\nA chunk of what we do know about it comes from a trove of Iranian documents stolen years ago by Israeli intelligence.\n\nA satellite image taken on June 14, 2025, shows no visible damage after Israel's strikes on Friday. (Maxar Technologies via CNN Newsource)\n\nIts main halls are an estimated 80 to 90 metres beneath the ground \u2013 safe from any aerial bomb known to be possessed by Israel, making destroying the facility from the air a near-impossible task.\n\nAs Iran's leadership reels from a series of devastating Israeli strikes, some analysts say that it is at Fordow that Iran may rush to convert enriched uranium stockpiles into a nuclear bomb.\n\nIsrael has targeted the facility in recent days but, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), so far it has either been unwilling \u2013 or unable \u2013 to damage it.\n\nTehran has long maintained the objectives of its nuclear program are peaceful, but Fordow has been at the heart of concern over Iran's ambitions.\n\n\"The size and configuration of this facility is inconsistent with a peaceful program,\" then US President Barack Obama said in 2009 as he, along with then French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown revealed the existence of Fordow to the world.\n\nJust days before the announcement, the Iranians, apparently knowing Western agencies had learned about the facility, told the IAEA of their desire to build a new fuel enrichment facility.\n\nBy that point construction at Fordow had been underway for years.\n\nTehran pushed back against the accusations, but condemnation even from ally Russia and concerns from China left it with little room to manoeuvre.\n\nConstruction started in the early 2000s\n\nThe US and its allies have not provided much detail on when the construction of Fordow started, but publicly available historical satellite imagery shows work at the site as far back as 2004, with photographs revealing two white square structures where the tunnel entrances are located today.\n\nThe IAEA says it has additional imagery showing construction as far back as 2002.\n\nA satellite image of Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant in Iran, as it was in 2004. (Maxar Technologies via CNN Newsource)\n\n\"Fordow is actually a project that started during what we call the crash nuclear weapons program of the early 2000s,\" David Albright, head of the Washington, DC-based Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a nonpartisan institution dedicated to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, said.\n\n\"The idea was they (the Iranians) would make weapon-grade uranium in that plant, and they would obtain low-enriched uranium from the civil nuclear program in Iran.\"\n\nIn 2009, a large outside support structure was already fully built and excavation was ongoing for what experts believe to be a ventilation shaft, crucial to allow air circulation into the facility.\n\nThat shaft was later concealed and camouflaged, more recent imagery also shows.\n\nTehran explained to the IAEA in a letter dated October 2009 that the decision to build the facility underground was a result of \"threats of military attacks against Iran,\" adding that Fordow would serve as a contingency for the nearby Natanz plant, which, it claimed, \"was among the targets threatened with military attacks\".\n\nIran told the IAEA the facility could house up to 3000 centrifuges.\n\nNuclear deal and Israeli accusations\n\nThe dangers posed by Fordow were largely tamed as a result of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) the so-called \"Iran nuclear deal,\" that required Iran to remove two-thirds of the centrifuges inside the facility, along with all nuclear material, after the facility was banned from any such work.\n\nThat process was slowly reversed when US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018.\n\nUS President Donald Trump gestures as he attends a family photo session during the G7 Summit, in Kananaskis, Alberta on Monday. (Suzanne Plunkett/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nFurther details about the facility were made public by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2018, after his country's intelligence services seized more than 55,000 documents from what Israel said was Iran's \"atomic archive.\"\n\nAmong the documents were detailed blueprints of Fordow and information on its objectives: to produce weapons-grade uranium, as part of Iran's nuclear weapons program, for at least one or two nuclear weapons per year.\n\n\"We never saw any, any inconsistency,\" Albright, who has combed through the documents, said of Iran's push to develop nuclear weapons.\n\n\"It's hundreds of thousands of pages. I mean you just can't make that amount of stuff up. I don't think anyone challenges it, and that's probably why there is an (IAEA) Board of Governors resolution against Iran.\"\n\nAt the time, then Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the revelations and Netanyahu's comments \"childish\" and \"laughable\".\n\nThen US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US had known about the material \"for a while\" and believed the documents were authentic.\n\nProtected from even the largest bombs\n\nRecent IAEA reports suggested Iran had ramped up production of enriched uranium to a level of 60 per cent at the Fordow facility, which, according to experts and the IAEA, now contains 2700 centrifuges.\n\n\"The significantly increased production and accumulation of highly enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,\" the IAEA said in a report on May 31.\n\n\"One of the things that elevated the tension, was they have no reason to do that, other than to be able to then go the next step and turn it into weapon-grade uranium,\" Albright said.\n\n\"It was interpreted as they're preparing themselves to be able to do it if they decide to. And if you're 60 per cent, you can turn it into weapon-grade uranium very quickly,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the ISIS think tank, \"Iran can convert its current stock of 60 per cent enriched uranium into 233 kg of weapon-grade uranium in three weeks at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant,\" enough for nine nuclear weapons.\n\nThat is why Fordow is a major focus of Israel's attempts to degrade and destroy Iran's nuclear program.\n\nBut is it even feasible?\n\nThe US is the only country that possesses the kind of bomb required to strike Iran's Fordow nuclear site, Israel's ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, said in an interview with Merit TV on Monday.\n\n\"For Fordow to be taken out by a bomb from the sky, the only country in the world that has that bomb is the United States. And that's a decision the United States has to take, whether or not it chooses to actually pursue that course,\" Leiter said.\n\nBut, he added, that wasn't the only option: \"There are other ways of dealing with Fordow.\"\n\nDestroying Fordow from the air would be almost impossible for Israel, according to a March report from the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank and would require significant firepower and assistance from the United States.\n\nIt would not even be reachable by the US' GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrator bombs, which only reach about 60 meters deep, according to the RUSI report.\n\nAnd the GBU-57 can only be delivered by US Air Force B-2 stealth bombers, something Israel doesn't have \u2013 even if the US would give it the bombs.\n\n\"Even the GBU-57/B would likely require multiple impacts at the same aiming point to have a good chance of penetrating the facility,\" said the report.\n\nOther analysts agree, saying, if the US were to try to hit Fordow, it probably couldn't be done with one bomb.\n\n\"I would bank on repeated strikes against Fordow,\" CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton, a former US Air Force colonel, said.\n\nAlbright says there could be other ways to disable Fordow.\n\n\"Israel could probably destroy the tunnel entrances pretty far back, and certainly destroy the ventilation system,\" he said.\n\n\"If you destroyed (the tunnels) and the electric electrical supply, it would be months before they could really operate.\"\n\nDespite its crucial role in Iran's nuclear program, Albright believes Fordow is just another piece of the puzzle.\n\n\"If you destroy it, it's not the end of the line, because you then go to the next threat, which is, how many centrifuges has Iran made that they didn't deploy at Fordow and Natanz? And where are they?\" he said.",

(juanmahache/Moment RF/Getty Images)\n\n\"This is one of the largest studies to date on the connection between marijuana and heart disease, and it raises serious questions about the assumption that cannabis imposes little cardiovascular risk,\" paediatrician Dr Lynn Silver, a clinical professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at University of California, San Francisco, said.\n\n\"Getting this right is critically important because cardiovascular disease is the top cause of death both in the United States and globally,\" Silver, who is also senior adviser at the Public Health Institute, a non-profit public health organisation that analyses marijuana policy and legalisation, said.\n\nSilver is the coauthor of an editorial published with the paper that calls for change in how cannabis is viewed by health professionals, regulatory bodies and the public at large.\n\n\"Clinicians need to screen people for cannabis use and educate them about its harms, the same way we do for tobacco, because in some population groups it's being used more widely than tobacco,\" she said.\n\n\"Our regulatory system, which has been almost entirely focused on creating legal infrastructure and licensing legal, for-profit (cannabis) businesses, needs to focus much more strongly on health warnings that educate people about the real risks.\"\n\nThe dangers of smoke (and maybe edibles)\n\nThe new systematic review and meta-analysis analysed medical information from large, observational studies conducted in Australia, Egypt, Canada, France, Sweden and the US between 2016 and 2023.\n\nThose studies did not ask people how they used cannabis \u2013 such as via smoking, vaping, dabbing, edibles, tinctures or topicals.\n\nDabbing involves vaporising concentrated cannabis and inhaling the vapour.\n\nHowever, \"based on epidemiological data, it is likely that cannabis was smoked in the vast majority of cases,\" Jouanjus said.\n\nSmoking tobacco is a well-known cause of heart disease \u2013 both the smoke and the chemicals in tobacco damage blood vessels and increase clotting, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nREAD MORE: English anger as Australia set to deport woman with MS\n\nTherefore, it is not surprising that smoking, vaping or dabbing cannabis could do the same, Silver said: \"Any of the many ways of inhaling cannabis are going to have risks to the user, and there's also secondhand smoke risks, which are similar to tobacco.\"\n\nThe notion that smoking cannabis is less harmful because it's \"natural\" is just wrong, Dr Beth Cohen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told CNN in a prior interview.\n\n\"When you burn something, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, it creates toxic compounds, carcinogens, and particulate matter that are harmful to health,\" Cohen said in an email.\n\nHowever, edibles may also play a role in heart disease, according to a May 2025 study.\n\nPeople who consumed edibles laced with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, showed signs of early cardiovascular disease similar to tobacco smokers.\n\n\"We found that vascular function was reduced by 42 per cent in marijuana smokers and by 56 per cent in THC-edible users compared to nonusers,\" Dr Leila Mohammadi, an assistant researcher in cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco, told CNN in a prior interview.\n\nThose studies did not ask people how they used cannabis \u2013 such as via smoking, vaping, dabbing, edibles, tinctures or topicals. (AP)\n\nThe danger of high potency cannabis\n\nNone of the studies included in the new meta-analysis asked users about the potency of THC in the products they consume.\n\nEven if they had, that information would be quickly outdated, Silver said.\n\n\"The cannabis market is a moving target. It is getting more potent every day,\" she said.\n\n\"What's being sold to people today in California is 510 times stronger than what it was in the 1970s. Concentrates can be 99 per cent pure THC. Vapes are over 80 per cent THC.\n\n\"A variety of chemically extracted cannabinoids can be almost pure THC, and all of these just have very different effects on people than smoking a joint in the 1970s.\"\n\nHigher potency weed is contributing to a host of problems, including an increase in addiction \u2013 a July 2022 study found consuming high-potency weed was linked to a fourfold increased risk of dependence.\n\nIn the United States, about three in 10 people who use marijuana have cannabis use disorder, the medical term for marijuana addiction, according to the CDC .\n\n\"We know that more potent cannabis makes people more likely to become addicted,\" Silver said.\n\n\"We know that more potent cannabis makes people more likely to develop psychosis, seeing and hearing things that aren't there, or schizophrenia. Habitual users may also suffer from uncontrollable vomiting.\"\n\nThe rise in potency is one reason that the current study may not have captured the full extent of the risk of marijuana for heart disease, Jouanjus said: \"We are afraid that the association might be even stronger than that reported.\"\n\nWhile science continues to study the risk, experts say it's time to think twice about the potential harms of cannabis use \u2013 especially if heart disease is a concern.\n\n\"If I was a 60-year-old person who had some heart disease risk, I would be very cautious about using cannabis,\" Silver said.\n\n\"I've seen older people who are using cannabis for pain or for sleep, some of whom have significant cardiovascular risk, or who have had strokes or had heart attacks or had angina, and they have no awareness that this may be putting them at greater risk.\"",

(Supplied)\n\nOverstimulation, also called sensory overload, is when the brain receives sensory input at an intensity or duration that exceeds an individual's capacity to effectively process it, says Sara Quinn.\n\nShe's a clinical psychologist and president of the Australian Psychological Society.\n\nIt's not a diagnosable condition, Dr Quinn says, but an experience that is \"very much dictated by a person's capacity\".\n\n\"What might be seemingly manageable for one person, or even positively stimulating for one person, may for another be an experience that is quite overwhelming or overloading and stressful.\"\n\nShe says overstimulation is likely on the rise in modern life.\n\n\"We're living in an increasingly technology driven world, with less time spent outdoors in environments that might be restorative.\"\n\nSigns you might be experiencing overwhelm Photo shows A woman sitting at a desk with her eyes closed rubbing her temples Experts say symptoms of overwhelm are important to address early on.\n\nOverstimulation triggers explained\n\nSensory overload reflects a mismatch between what the environment demands of somebody and their capacity to process it, says Dr Quinn.\n\nIt can be related to light, sound, taste, touch, and smell.\n\nDr Quinn says what causes overstimulation is highly subjective, but more typical triggers include loud sounds like music or fireworks, busy crowds, or strong smells.\n\n\"For others, especially in children, we see the sensation of a particular type of stimuli on skin like scratchy material.\n\n\" For some it might be unwanted or sudden physical contact. \"\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nFamily coach H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gatland says people may also experience overstimulation when there are too many demands at once, such as chores, work and \"kids asking questions\", or a cluttered or chaotic environment.\n\nDr Quinn says things may lead to feeling teary, distressed, stressed, anxious and confused.\n\n\"Other people might experience irritability, agitation and even anger.\"\n\nAs people attempt to escape or mitigate overstimulation, their emotional state may change.\n\n\"For children, it might manifest as a tantrum, meltdown, or withdrawal or anxiety in adults,\" Dr Quinn says.\n\nThere can be physical signs, too, such as headaches, muscle tension, or fatigue, says Ms Gatland.\n\nWho is susceptible?\n\nAnyone can experience sensory overload, and what we can tolerate may differ from time to time depending on a range of factors, explains Dr Quinn.\n\nFor example, when someone is fatigued or stressed.\n\nIt can also be associated with mental health conditions, and neurodivergence such as autism and ADHD, says Dr Quinn.\n\n\"Someone with anxiety might have heightened sensitivity \u2026 as we know for people with neurodivergence there can be difficulty filtering sensory input, which might lead to being more easily overstimulated.\n\n\"We know that individuals who are in throws of dementia, actually experience impaired sensory integration.\"\n\nPsychologists on the Let Them Theory Photo shows woman sitting on couch sipping cup of coffee The Let Them Theory from motivational speaker and author Mel Robbins is about letting go of the need to control others and instead focusing on your reactions. We asked three psychologists for their take.\n\nMeghan says sensitivity to overstimulation has increased with each child she's had.\n\nMs Gatland says parenting young children can be a really demanding, noisy time of life.\n\n\"You only stop when you sleep, if you can go to sleep.\n\n\"It's a 24-hour job \u2026 and if you don't have time to rest, it gets much harder.\"\n\nPeople in high-pressure jobs might find sensory overload common, she says.\n\n\"If you have to do lots of decision-making at the same time, or you have a meeting and someone is calling you and someone else is asking you a question \u2014 that can be very overstimulating.\"\n\nWays to cope\n\nMeghan says her strategy for dealing with sensory overload is locking herself in the bedroom.\n\n\"But it's just a band-aid,\" she says.\n\nMs Gatland says taking micro-breaks, even pockets of five minutes, can help people experiencing overstimulation.\n\n\"Step outside, sit in the car for a minute alone.\n\n\"If you can take five minutes just to tap into your nervous system, using techniques like breathing or massaging yourself, that will help calm you.\"\n\nNoise-cancelling headphones can also be helpful for people triggered by noise, she says. Earplugs may suffice.\n\n\"It's about lowering your sensory input \u2014 turning off the TV when no-one is watching and it's not helping the household.\"\n\nTidying up cluttered spaces, whether at work or in the home, may also help, as well as dimming lighting, and creating \"nice\" spaces to be in.\n\nDr Quinn says creating visual \"quiet\" can be as important as adjusting sound.\n\n\" Simplifying our surroundings, reducing any unnecessary stimuli. \"\n\nShe recommends reducing our digital exposure, by putting our phone on do not disturb and turning off app notifications when suitable.\n\nAnd spending time in nature will help improve intentional restoration, Dr Quinn says.\n\n\"Taking off your shoes, walking barefoot on the grass. Taking a walk around your back garden. Even small things, like having plants around your workspace.\"\n\nFor parents who can't be alone in that moment, take the kids outside with you, she suggests.\n\nMs Gatland encourages people to communicate what they need to those around them, whether it's their kid, partner, or colleagues, for example.\n\nShe says it's helpful to remember overstimulation is a normal human response.\n\n\"It's not a failure, it's your body telling you to pause and recharge, not push through.\"\n\nThose who need more support should talk to their GP or reach out to a psychologist, says Dr Quinn.\n\n\"Primarily we want to shift them from a sense of loss of control towards greater psychological flexibility \u2026 and give them strategies to manage stress.\"",

(ABC News: Xavier Martin)\n\nAlex Vaughan, policy officer at ALEC, said the Singleton water licence posed a \"catastrophic\" risk to the region.\n\n\"Singleton is simply too big to be sustainable,\" he said.\n\nHe said it was \"outrageous\" one of Australia's largest groundwater licences for agriculture had been granted in a region where temperatures regularly reach over 40 degrees.\n\n\"This is a terrible project that resoundingly fails the pub test,\" he said.",

The Laura Quinkan Dance Festival won't go ahead this year as organisers grapple with \"excessive\" costs and management delays.\n\nThe corporation is accused of two counts of failing to lodge annual reports with the registrar, and one count of failing to lodge a general report.\n\nSolicitor Caitlin Miller, representing the corporation, on Wednesday told the Cairns Magistrates Court: \"Steps are being taken to \u2026 appoint a liquidator.\"\n\nAdam Knight, a collector and dealer of Indigenous art, said Lockhart River became iconic for its \"distinct style, completely different to Indigenous art produced in other parts of Australia\".\n\nHe said the 30-year-old art centre's \"nationally and internationally recognised artists of significance \u2026 were very, very important in the growth of Queensland Indigenous art.\"\n\nAdam Knight (left) with artists at the Lockhart River Art Centre. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\n\"There are dealers in this industry already that I know have been trying to help and buying paintings for probably more than they're worth and taking on things just to try and keep it going as long as they can,\" Mr Knight said.\n\n\" If it does go completely pear-shaped, it'll be a very sad day for Indigenous art in Australia but also Queensland specifically. \"\n\nDeaths, departures mark hard times\n\nMs Miller told the court the decision to enter liquidation was made \"in the last week or so\", although directors were yet to make a formal resolution.\n\n\"I'm unable to provide the court with any certainty around the timing \u2026 but I understand those involved, the defendant and other professional advisers, are working quickly to make this happen,\" she said.\n\nThe corporation has yet to enter a plea to the regulatory breaches.\n\nMagistrate Leanne Scoines adjourned the case until next month.\n\nDorothy Hobson, a renowned local artist and local councillor on the board of the corporation, declined to comment.\n\nMr Knight said Lockhart River Art Centre had struggled in recent years, following the deaths of some artists and the relocation of others away from the remote community.\n\nThe Indigenous township of Lockhart River is 800km from Cairns. (Facebook: Qld Fire and Emergency Services)\n\n\"A lot of other art centres probably have the benefit of a larger Indigenous population that comes through and fills those artistic gaps, where probably Lockhart hasn't had the luxury of that,\" he said.\n\nHe said while global Aboriginal art sales were strong, the domestic market had lagged in the past two years in a \"pretty tough economic environment\".\n\nGovernments called to act\n\nMr Knight said the art centre was worth \"millions\" to the community economically and for its health benefits.\n\n\"In my opinion, there's no question Aboriginal art is the number one self-determined Indigenous industry in this country,\" he said.\n\nThe art centre has drawn people to Lockhart River, a remote place on Cape York.

(ABC News: Geoff Kemp)\n\nThe work, published today in the journal Sports Medicine \u2014 Open, found changes in the brains of players who participated in a heading study by researchers at the University of Sydney and Griffith University.\n\n\"Overall, I'd say we found that soccer heading has a subtle effect on the brain even when there's no concussion and cognitive impairment detected,\" said researcher Dr Danielle McCartney, a research fellow at the Lambert Institute of Cannabinoid Therapeutics at Sydney University.\n\nThe study recruited 15 male amateur soccer players between the ages of 18 and 35 to head a ball launched 20 times in 20 minutes from a machine at a fixed distance and speed.\n\nThe players then underwent MRI scans and gave blood samples.\n\nDr McCartney's study employed a machine that projected balls at a fixed speed and distance. (ABC News: Geoff Kemp)\n\nDr McCartney said the results showed the players' brain chemistry had changed immediately after doing the headers.\n\n\"We found altered electrical conductive and altered chemistry in certain regions of the brain,\" she said.\n\nThe changes included altered chemistry in a part of the brain involved in motor control and decreased electrical conductivity across several areas.\n\n\"We also found that two blood biomarkers, which have previously been associated with head trauma and dementia, were elevated following the heading task,\" Dr McCartney said.\n\nDr. McCartney said the study monitored changes in the area of the brain involved in motor control. (ABC News: Geoff Kemp)\n\nThe blood samples showed elevated levels of two proteins, GFAP and NFL.\n\nElevated levels of these two proteins are also seen in cases of concussion and dementia, albeit at much higher levels than were seen in the study's participants.\n\nThese proteins are currently considered some of the best available blood biomarkers of brain injury and future dementia risk.\n\nBut Dr McCartney was quick to point out that the players in the study didn't suffer any cognitive effects.\n\n\"It tells us that they (the effects) are subtle,\" she said.\n\n\"It tells us that we need to do further work to really understand the clinical and long-term significance of these effects.\"\n\nDr. McCartney said more work needs to be done to understand the long-term impacts of heading. (ABC News: Geoff Kemp)\n\nDr Nathan Delang, who led the research as a PhD candidate and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Queensland, said more studies were being done to understand the patterns.\n\n\"Elevated levels of these biomarkers indicate brain cells have been disturbed at a microstructural level,\" Dr Delang said.\n\n\"The clinical and long-term significance of such small elevations is still being studied, particularly in relation to how much, and what pattern, of exposure might lead to effects on brain structure and function.\"\n\nBut Dr McCartney said determining the long-term impact of soccer heading was difficult because it was virtually impossible to sort out the effects of sub-concussive knocks \u2014 like heading a soccer ball \u2014 from more severe head knocks.\n\n\"Often people who are experiencing a lot of non-concussive impacts are also experiencing concussive impacts, and so, it makes it hard to do these observational studies,\" she said.\n\n\"Our research shows that heading has acute effects on the brain.\n\n\"Certainly, we need more studies to determine whether or not these effects persist, whether they not they accumulate over time.\n\n\"Those kinds of things will help us better understand the effects of heading on long-term health.\"\n\nMore studies are needed to determine whether the effects of heading accumulate over time. (Getty Images: Robert Niedring)\n\nThe research will add to the debate in Australia about whether children should be allowed to head the ball.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, young children are banned from heading until they're in their early teens.\n\nCertain clubs in Australia have also initiated a ban, but it hasn't been adopted across the country.\n\nIn a statement, Football Australia said it released updated guidelines on concussion for junior and community sport last month.\n\n\"Junior football is played on smaller fields, with a reduced number of players and small goals,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Modifications to the laws of the game, including no throw-ins and the requirement for goalkeepers to release the ball by rolling or throwing, help reduce the incidence of heading at a junior level.\n\n\"Football Australia has approved an expert project team to consider a Football Australia Expert Working Group's suggestions on strategies to reduce the incidence, magnitude and burden of heading in youth football, commencing with a comprehensive literature review.\"\n\nLee-Young said the research might make players reconsider how much they head the ball. (ABC News: Geoff Kemp)\n\nLee-Young said the University of Sydney research might make people consider the potential dangers of heading, but he didn't believe it would ever be banned from the game.\n\n\"It's like saying you can't bowl a bouncer in cricket \u2014 it's part of the sport. It wouldn't really be soccer with heading,\" he said.\n\n\"But for kids, it might be a different story.\"\n\nDr McCartney said there needed to be caution.\n\n\"As a starting point, I think we need to be exercising caution in and around heading,\" Dr McCartney said.\n\n\"Making an effort to limit exposure as appropriate.\n\n\"Undertaking intense training sessions involving a lot of heading might not be the best plan based on our results.\"",

(ABC Gold Coast: Glen Mullane)\n\nThe Scenic Rim Council has a public landslide hazard map, but the couple was unaware at the time of purchasing the property that the document existed.\n\nThe home owners said they did \"the normal checks\" before the sale and believed the seller should have disclosed the landslide risk.\n\nThey made that discovery nearly two decades later in 2022 when heavy rainfall triggered a series of landslides, damaging their million-dollar home.\n\n\"The back deck pulled off, the front side of the slab has moved and slipped,\" Mr Radunz said.\n\n\"The floor has dropped, the driveway is all cracked, doors don't close very well, windows don't close, and it has substantially damaged the pipe system underneath.\"\n\nThe driveway is cracked and slipping away.

(ABC Gold Coast: Glen Mullane)\n\nSellers obliged to reveal information \u2014 if asked\n\nIn Queensland, there is no legal requirement for sellers to disclose if a property is affected by natural hazards such as landslides or flooding.\n\nThe state government passed the Property Law Act in 2023, which requires owners to disclose important information about a property to prospective buyers.\n\nThe new seller disclosure statement comes into effect from August 1.\n\nReal Estate Institute of Queensland chief executive Antonia Mercorella said the law would not have made a difference to the couple's \"tragic\" situation as sellers would not be required to disclose information about a property's natural hazard history.\n\n\"There are just certain disclosures that the law doesn't consider that a vendor needs to make,\" Ms Mercorella said.\n\nAntonia Mercorella says the new seller disclosure laws do not cover natural hazards. (ABC News: Alexander Papp)\n\nShe said vendors would not also be required to disclose the structural soundness of the building, pest infestations, the presence of asbestos within buildings, or improvements on the property.\n\nInstead, sellers were obliged to provide a range of information, including any encumbrances affecting the property, zoning information, building compliance certificates, and rates and water charges.\n\nUnder consumer law, however, sellers would be obliged to reveal relevant information if asked.\n\n\"For instance, if a buyer were to ask the question: has this property previously flooded? Then clearly consumer laws exist that make it clear that one cannot lie about that or mislead the buyer,\" Ms Mercorella said.\n\nShe urged buyers to carry out their own investigations on a property, either through speaking with the real estate agent or lawyer, or by referring to the flood or landslide hazard mapping provided by the local council.\n\nScheme falls short\n\nQueensland councils have been advocating for years for the natural disaster disclosure to be included in the legislation and some remain disappointed it has been omitted.\n\n\"This could have been an easy fix that could have helped create fewer headaches for people,\" Moreton Bay Council Mayor Peter Flannery said.\n\nMoreton Bay Mayor Peter Flannery says his council wants compulsory disaster disclosures to protect buyers. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nCr Flannery said that although council information about natural hazard risks was freely available online, it was often overlooked by potential buyers.\n\n\"A lot of people aren't aware that information is available,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not put up front to them that this is something that you should be made aware of before you continue on with this contract.\"\n\nMr Radunz said he hoped other prospective buyers could learn from their experience and avoid the same costly mistake.\n\n\"Do all the searches you can, whatever you think might go wrong, go and check it out,\" he said.",

It's been coming for a while (check out my article from 2019!), but we haven't really unlocked the power of it.\n\nIdeally you'd be able to shift banks and all of your direct debits would move, your transaction list would be there ... you'd just shift providers.\n\nThis happens with mobile phones \u2014 where numbers are \"ported\" when you find a better deal \u2014 but not with banks.\n\nOr as the ACCC puts it: \"The CDR is an economy-wide data sharing program that empowers Australians to leverage the data businesses hold about them for their own benefit.\"\n\nHere's ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe: \u201cPoor data quality prevents consumers from experiencing the full benefits of the CDR.

    "text": "Loading Fed chair Jerome Powell referred to that uncertainty when he said the effects of the tariffs would depend on their final level, while also saying that the increase in tariffs was likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity. \u201cThe pass-through of tariffs to consumer price inflation is a whole process that\u2019s very uncertain,\u201d he said. But someone, he said, has to pay for the tariffs. \u201cAs you know, there are many parties in that chain. There\u2019s the manufacturer, exporter, importer, retailer and consumer, and each one of those is going to be trying not to be the one to pay for the tariff. But together, they will all pay. Or maybe one party will pay it all. But that process is very hard to predict,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, in the meantime, the Fed will sit on its hands until the fog around the direction of the economy has lifted. \u201cWith uncertainty as elevated as it is, no one holds these rate paths with conviction,\u201d Powell said, acknowledging the diversity of views within the committee. He also cautioned that the Fed might find itself in the \u201cchallenging scenario\u201d in which its dual mandate of maintaining stable prices and maximising employment will be \u201cin tension.\u201d Spectre of stagflation Without using the word, what he was referring to there was the threat of stagflation, the combination of slowing growth and rising inflation. That is a scenario that tariff-induced inflation could produce, with consumers facing material price rises that would reduce their retail spending and companies experiencing lower margins and coming under pressure to cut their expenses, including labour costs.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that the tariffs will produce a one-time spike in the inflation rate, as what is effectively a new tax on consumption is absorbed by US importers and consumers before prices - and the inflation rate - stabilise at their new level. In this scenario, the impact on the inflation rate would be transitory. The Fed was burned the last time it thought a surge in inflation was transitory, when the impact of the pandemic on global supply chains generated a massive increase in inflation that proved persistent. It was a very damaging episode for the Fed and its peers in other markets, and one that will ensure the US central bank will approach any new outbreak of inflation less complacently than it did then. While a slight majority of the committee members have continued to pencil in two rate cuts this year, as the majority did in March, the way Trump\u2019s tariffs are being rolled out and the lags between their introduction and their impact on prices and economic activity probably mean the level of uncertainty over their impact on inflation won\u2019t be dispelled until much later this year. Indeed, those effects might not show up fully until sometime next year. Financial markets are pricing in a more than 70 per cent chance of a cut in September, but the Fed may continue to watch and wait through most of the second half of the year \u2013 which would further infuriate the US president, who made another of his verbal assaults on Powell ahead of the Fed meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe probably won\u2019t cut today. Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed?\u201d Trump called for a 2.5-percentage-point cut to the federal funds rate (which is the equivalent to the Reserve Bank\u2019s cash rate), saying that would enable the US Treasury to issue cheaper long-term debt. Big Beautiful Bill pressure That\u2019s not going to happen, but it highlighted another potential source of inflationary pressure: Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the federal budget bill that the congressional Republicans are trying to finalise.\n\nThe latest assessment of that bill by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), issued this week, estimates that it will increase US budget deficits by $US2.8 trillion over the next decade and add $US3.3 trillion to the country\u2019s government debt in public hands. Loading The CBO said the bill would push up inflation and interest rates and add $US441 billion to the government\u2019s interest costs. No wonder Trump wants the central bank to slash interest rates. The other wild card in the inflation conundrum is the new outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East and how it might impact oil and therefore US petrol prices. The oil price has jumped this month, from just above $US60 a barrel to $US75 a barrel, but would soar if the conflict either damaged Iran\u2019s oil exporting infrastructure or Iran took action to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only marine entry point to the Persian Gulf. Nearly a third of the world\u2019s oil supplies pass through the strait.",

The sunscreens were decanted into amber glass jars (which block UV light and prevent ingredient breakdown), sealed, labelled, and transported by a Sydney-based accredited lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After Ultra Violette's product returned an SPF of 4 when tested at the Sydney lab, we sent a different batch to an accredited, specialised laboratory in Germany, the Normec Schrader Institute, for a validation test,\" de Silva said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe validation test returned an SPF of 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer Council Australia \u2014 whose three products missed the mark, according to Choice's test results \u2014 said while it is concerned about the findings, separate testing by its product sponsor has shown \"compliance with their labelled SPF rating\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also acknowledged SPF testing, conducted on human skin, \"can produce variable results between laboratories, even when the same standards are followed\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TGA last week said it was investigating the Choice findings.\n\n\n\nThe medicines watchdog said there could be variability in SPF testing results across laboratories, due to the reliance on human subject testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said a number of the Choice-tested products returned results in the range of SPF 30, which provide \"high protection\" and are effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Given Australia's high incidence of skin cancer, the TGA reiterates that using sunscreen is an important measure to prevent harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, in addition to seeking shade, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, wearing protective clothing and using sunglasses,\" the TGA said.\n\n\n\nLightweight sunscreens are 'less robust'\n\nMakeup-compatible sunscreens are desirable for their non-greasy, non-chalky and zero-white cast finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile suitable sometimes, including for indoor or shady activity, Wong said \"cosmetically elegant sunscreens\" are ultimately \"less robust\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\" The protection you get from a sunscreen depends a lot on how intact that sunscreen layer is. To make a sunscreen stay on your skin in an intact layer, a lot of the time you have to sacrifice texture,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are getting lots of exposure, generally water resistance is a good thing to look for because that means it's been tested in quite extreme conditions, which means it should last through a lot of activity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also urged other sun safety practices, including wearing layered clothing.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Gay and bisexual men, as well as transgender women, will soon be able to donate blood and plasma after rule changes to make the service more inclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\nLifeblood, Australia's national blood, milk, and microbiota donation and manufacturing service, has announced changes to sexual activity rules for blood and plasma donation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 14 July, the service will remove most sexual activity wait times for plasma donations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, the rules stopped gay and bisexual men and transgender women from donating plasma if they had had sex with men in the previous three months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was designed to stop people who were at a higher risk of exposure to HIV from donating, and also included sex workers and women who had sex with bisexual men.\n\n\n\nWorld-leading 'plasma pathway'\n\nThe announcement is a world-leading \"plasma pathway\" which will allow most people \u2014 including gay and bisexual men and anyone who takes the HIV-preventative medication PrEP \u2014 to donate plasma without a wait period if they meet all other eligibility criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma is the donation type most needed by Australian patients, Lifeblood chief medical officer Jo Pink said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With more than 600,0000 people estimated to be covered by the previous wait times, we now anticipate an extra 24,000 donors and 95,000 extra donations of plasma to be made each year,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service is also working on changes to eligibility for blood and platelet donations after the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved a submission to remove gender-based sexual activity rules.\n\n\n\nUnder those changes, all donors will be asked the same questions about their sexual activity, regardless of their gender or sexuality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, most people with new or multiple partners will also be able to donate blood if they have not had anal sex in the last three months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will bring an end to male donors being asked if they've had sex with another man.\n\n\n\nCurrent donation rules 'very difficult' for LGBTQIA+ community\n\n\"This is a significant milestone in being able to safely reduce wait times and make it easier for more people in the LGBTQIA+ community to donate,\" Pink said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Blood safety is and always will be our top priority, but we know the current donation rules have been very difficult for many people in the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While they were put in place to ensure a safe blood supply in the past, we know that they've contributed to the stigma faced by the community.\"\n\n\n\nThe changes mean Australia's regulations are world-leading and would unlock thousands of life-saving donations, Health Equity Matters chief executive Dash Heath-Paynter said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Loading Fed chair Jerome Powell referred to that uncertainty when he said the effects of the tariffs would depend on their final level, while also saying that the increase in tariffs was likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity. \u201cThe pass-through of tariffs to consumer price inflation is a whole process that\u2019s very uncertain,\u201d he said. But someone, he said, has to pay for the tariffs. \u201cAs you know, there are many parties in that chain. There\u2019s the manufacturer, exporter, importer, retailer and consumer, and each one of those is going to be trying not to be the one to pay for the tariff. But together, they will all pay. Or maybe one party will pay it all. But that process is very hard to predict,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, in the meantime, the Fed will sit on its hands until the fog around the direction of the economy has lifted. \u201cWith uncertainty as elevated as it is, no one holds these rate paths with conviction,\u201d Powell said, acknowledging the diversity of views within the committee. He also cautioned that the Fed might find itself in the \u201cchallenging scenario\u201d in which its dual mandate of maintaining stable prices and maximising employment will be \u201cin tension.\u201d Spectre of stagflation Without using the word, what he was referring to there was the threat of stagflation, the combination of slowing growth and rising inflation. That is a scenario that tariff-induced inflation could produce, with consumers facing material price rises that would reduce their retail spending and companies experiencing lower margins and coming under pressure to cut their expenses, including labour costs.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that the tariffs will produce a one-time spike in the inflation rate, as what is effectively a new tax on consumption is absorbed by US importers and consumers before prices - and the inflation rate - stabilise at their new level. In this scenario, the impact on the inflation rate would be transitory. The Fed was burned the last time it thought a surge in inflation was transitory, when the impact of the pandemic on global supply chains generated a massive increase in inflation that proved persistent. It was a very damaging episode for the Fed and its peers in other markets, and one that will ensure the US central bank will approach any new outbreak of inflation less complacently than it did then. While a slight majority of the committee members have continued to pencil in two rate cuts this year, as the majority did in March, the way Trump\u2019s tariffs are being rolled out and the lags between their introduction and their impact on prices and economic activity probably mean the level of uncertainty over their impact on inflation won\u2019t be dispelled until much later this year. Indeed, those effects might not show up fully until sometime next year. Financial markets are pricing in a more than 70 per cent chance of a cut in September, but the Fed may continue to watch and wait through most of the second half of the year \u2013 which would further infuriate the US president, who made another of his verbal assaults on Powell ahead of the Fed meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe probably won\u2019t cut today. Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed?\u201d Trump called for a 2.5-percentage-point cut to the federal funds rate (which is the equivalent to the Reserve Bank\u2019s cash rate), saying that would enable the US Treasury to issue cheaper long-term debt. Big Beautiful Bill pressure That\u2019s not going to happen, but it highlighted another potential source of inflationary pressure: Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the federal budget bill that the congressional Republicans are trying to finalise.\n\nThe latest assessment of that bill by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), issued this week, estimates that it will increase US budget deficits by $US2.8 trillion over the next decade and add $US3.3 trillion to the country\u2019s government debt in public hands. Loading The CBO said the bill would push up inflation and interest rates and add $US441 billion to the government\u2019s interest costs. No wonder Trump wants the central bank to slash interest rates. The other wild card in the inflation conundrum is the new outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East and how it might impact oil and therefore US petrol prices. The oil price has jumped this month, from just above $US60 a barrel to $US75 a barrel, but would soar if the conflict either damaged Iran\u2019s oil exporting infrastructure or Iran took action to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only marine entry point to the Persian Gulf. Nearly a third of the world\u2019s oil supplies pass through the strait.",

    "text": "By expanding green waste collection, the council anticipates saving up to $32 million over the next five years.\n\nAll Brisbane Council households will now be charged for a green bin after the service was previously optional. Source: Google/Brisbane City Council\n\nTens of thousands of residents on the east coast are set to see a $50 increase in their annual waste charges, as Brisbane City Council launches its long-anticipated universal green waste bin program.\n\nStarting in August, all Brisbane households will be charged a flat annual waste fee of $512.96 \u2014 regardless of whether they use a green bin. This replaces the city\u2019s previous opt-in system, where only those who requested a green bin paid an extra fee of $49.62 per year, the Brisbane Times reported.\n\nUnder the new scheme, green waste bins will be automatically provided to around 170,000 stand-alone homes, unless residents actively choose to opt-out. Apartment residents will still need to opt-in to receive one.\n\nThe move eliminates individual green bin surcharges and replaces them with a flat levy applied to all households. For those who were already paying for a green waste bin under the old opt-in model, their total waste charge will stay about the same. However, for residents who didn\u2019t previously have a green bin, the change means an increase in their annual waste costs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe council said just 30 per cent of eligible households took up the former opt-in offer.\n\nWhile the rollout won\u2019t include FOGO (food organics and garden organics) bins, the council will continue its compost rebate scheme. Supplied/TikTok\n\nWhat's happening in Brisbane with green bins?\n\nLord Mayor Adrian Schrinner described the initiative as a \"large-scale tax-avoidance scheme\", aimed at helping the council sidestep what he referred to as the state government\u2019s \"bin tax\".\n\nHe said that it will reduce the city's landfill costs. By expanding green waste collection, the council anticipates saving up to $32 million over the next five years. \"Every house will get a green bin, and that will be part of the business as usual service,\" he said, the Brisbane Times reported.\n\n\"The reason we\u2019re doing that is because of the state government\u2019s bin tax\u2026 that effectively forces ever-increasing costs onto councils.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLess landfill reduces council's state tax bill\n\nCurrently, the council\u2019s green bin program is helping to divert 43,000 tonnes of green waste from landfill, a move estimated to have saved ratepayers $1.6 million in waste levy fees imposed by the Queensland Government. With plans to expand the program, the council anticipates annual savings of between $2 and $3 million in the first year, with the potential to reach up to $32 million over five years.\n\nThe state government introduced a bin levy in 2019, charging councils roughly $115 for every tonne of general waste sent to landfill. This fee is set to rise by $10 each year until 2028.\n\nFor people interested in recycling food scraps and kitchen waste, Schrinner said the council will continue its compost rebate program, which provides grants of up to $100 for composting gear and $200 for food waste recycling systems.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOpposition leader Jared Cassidy acknowledged the importance of the program but pointed to broader funding issues. \"The unfortunate reality is, we do have to have a charge for waste services when the state is increasing the tax,\" he said.\n\n\"We support the rollout of green bins because we know that we need to divert more waste from landfill, and we know that we need to address climate change at every level \u2014 that\u2019s the biggest thing.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "The issue isn't expected to resolve itself until 2026, and consumers may soon have to pay more.\n\nFor now, you can still find pepper at any supermarket for less than $5. Source: Michael Dahlstrom\n\nStep into any supermarket and you can buy a grinder full of black pepper for less than $5. But the household staple is set to become more scarce over the next 18 months, and while Aussies won\u2019t have any problem finding it on shelves, prices are already increasing for wholesalers.\n\nIan Hemphill, the founder of the iconic Aussie brand Herbie\u2019s Spices, is paying 20 per cent more for pepper than he was five months ago. But it\u2019s a problem he expects to see with the various spices he purchases because they are agricultural commodities that can be impacted by the weather.\n\nA key reason for the price increase is a lack of rain where the crop is primarily harvested \u2014 India, Vietnam and Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cThe main thing that will affect pepper is when you get a poor monsoon,\u201d Hemphill told Yahoo News. \u201cWhen you get a good monsoon, you\u2019ll have a spike of green pepper corns that look like a luscious bunch of grapes, but when it\u2019s poor, you have fewer berries forming.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRelated: Pepper grinders sold at supermarkets have major problem\n\nThere have always been fluctuations in the spice trade, which merchants lovingly refer to as the \u201cworld\u2019s second oldest profession\u201d. In the late 1990s, vanilla plantations in Madagascar were hit with severe storms, and the farm-gate price jumped by 1,300 per cent over two years.\n\nPepper remains relatively affordable in supermarkets. Source: Michael Dahlstrom\n\nWhy Aussies can expect to pay more for their groceries\n\nExperts at the independent think tank, the Climate Council, expect consumers in Australia to face more fluctuations in grocery prices as the climate continues to warm and traditional weather patterns destabilise.\n\nIts economist Nicki Hutley predicts significant and permanent increases in costs as weather patterns change. This could mean growing more crops in hothouses, embracing lab-grown meat, or raising animals in sheds rather than paddocks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get smarter around farming. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean groceries will be cheaper, in fact it will be the opposite,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll still get a lot of volatility. You can\u2019t grow everything in a greenhouse at the scale we need.\u201d\n\nExtreme weather events are a constant around the world. After the March floods, Queensland alone is believed to have lost more than 100,000 head of livestock. At the same time, parts of Victoria, NSW, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are experiencing record-breaking drought, forcing farmers to hand-feed their animals with hay and grains, which are surging in price.\n\nSadly, the problem is set to get worse. Countries like Australia and the United States are continuing to extract fossil fuels from the ground. Australia just approved an extension of its second-largest fossil fuel project in history, the North-West Shelf, which is set to release billions of tonnes of carbon-like emissions into the atmosphere over its lifetime.\n\nThe world could reach 2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels in just 15 years, making droughts, floods and cyclones more severe and frequent than they are today.\n\nThree other factors could be impacting pepper price\n\nBut there are other factors also expected to contribute to price fluctuations. Pepper continues to be the world\u2019s most traded and consumed spice, and demand remains constant.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDespite technology advances in other farming sectors like viticulture and wheat, pepper continues to be mostly picked by hand. And in the long-term, Hemphill believes its price will be impacted by increasing labour costs.\n\nOther price influences will be harder to predict. For instance, Hemphill has seen a surge of interest in pepper because it\u2019s a key ingredient in turmeric, a power that\u2019s been embraced as a popular health drink in Australia.\n\nAnother factor that doesn\u2019t affect the farm-gate price but increases the cost to merchants is shipping. Due to recent conflict in the Middle East, the price of importing a container to Australia has more than doubled.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
