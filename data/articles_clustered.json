    "text": "When jolted awake by the blare of an alarm clock, it's tempting to reach for the snooze button to catch a bit more shut-eye. For many people, \"just five more minutes\" is practically a morning mantra. And what's the harm?\n\nThere's increasing debate about your snoozing habit, and whether or not it's silently sabotaging your morning.\n\nOn the \"stop snoozing\" side of the research, American sleep scientist Dr Rebecca Robbins suggests the snooze alarm may actually cost us sleep.\n\nThere is debate about the benefits of hitting the snooze button on your alarm when you wake in the morning. (Getty)\n\n\"That first alarm may interrupt vital stages of sleep, and anything that you might be able to get after hitting the snooze alarm is probably going to be low quality and fragmented sleep,\" said Robbins, an associate scientist for the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital, in the north-east US.\n\nThe average snoozer takes an extra 11 minutes after their first alarm, according to a new study coauthored by Robbins that used data from the sleep-tracking app SleepCycle. That adds up to about one night's worth of sleep per month spent snoozing.\n\nAs we sleep, the brain cycles through different stages of neurological activity and the second half of the night is dominated by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when most of our dreaming is thought to take place. It's an important sleep stage for our cognitive function and memory consolidation, said Robbins, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"When you press the snooze button, especially for just a few minutes at a time, you're not likely to return to that REM stage,\" Robbins said.\n\nBut for a different take, there are sleep experts such as Dr Justin Fiala, a pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine physician at Northwestern Medicine Canning Thoracic Institute in Chicago.\n\nGaining an uninterrupted night's sleep has major health benefits. (iStock)\n\nThere isn't consensus on whether this lighter sleep achieved during a snooze session always does more harm than good, said Fiala, who is also an assistant professor at Northwestern Medicine.\n\nOn one hand, losing out on quality sleep instead of just waking up later may increase the risk of cognitive impairment and lower one's mood.\n\n\"Certainly, if you're feeling worse off (and) more tired from the snooze alarm, I would recommend going back to waking up cold turkey without it,\" said Fiala, who also runs the CommunityHealth Chicago sleep clinic.\n\nOn the other hand, those with a certain chronotype \u2014 a natural disposition determined by factors such as age and genetics \u2014 may benefit from the habit, Fiala said, referencing a 2023 study which found night owls tend to rely on their snooze button more.\n\n\"If your chronotype is nocturnal, you're a night owl, but your work schedule requires you to be up at 5am, that increases the dissonance between what your body is naturally inclined to do,\" Fiala said.\n\nFor these night owls, the brief period of light sleep induced by the snooze button may actually help them transition from deeper stages of sleep interrupted by the first alarm into wakefulness, he said, adding that more research should be done to fully understand this effect and its limitations.\n\nRegardless of one's chronotype, this distinction of who gets the most out of snoozing can also help inform how to get the most out of snoozing.\n\nParamedics and other shift workers have to adapt to changing sleep patterns.. (Nine)\n\nConsistency is key\n\nMost sleep experts emphasise adults get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep per night for good health and emotional well-being. Sleeping enough can also reduce feelings of tiredness upon waking, but the consistency of your sleep timing is just as important as duration, said Kimberly Honn, an associate professor of psychology at Washington State University Spokane, in the north-western US.\n\nAt deep stages of sleep, electric pulses of the brain reach a highly rhythmic pattern different from our more erratic, awakened state, she explained. Trying to wake up during these stages cuts important brain maintenance processes short and can lead one to experience the foggy effects of sleep inertia, which can last for several minutes or even hours after waking up.\n\nWhen the body is accustomed to a regular sleep schedule, it may reduce the experience of sleep inertia upon waking, Honn said. The body can grow accustomed to moving through each sleep stage at similar times, ensuring sleep cycles are completed before waking and eventually allowing you to fall asleep faster.\n\n\"In the perfect world, we would not be relying on an alarm clock at all,\" Robbins said. \"We would be able to fall asleep and wake up naturally and have energy throughout the day.\"\n\nFiala said he generally recommends varying bedtimes by no more than 30 minutes per night, even on weekends. If you have to switch schedules, he says you should change it incrementally over time.\n\nThe healthiest places to live in Australia revealed View Gallery\n\nOptimising your morning routine\n\nIt's possible people who use the snooze button less simply don't have the luxury to sleep past their alarm, Robbins suggested.\n\nInflexible work schedules could require first responders to start their shift promptly, or parents may have to rally their children out the door and toward the school bus.\n\nFor this reason, Robbins recommends those trying to ditch a snoozing habit introduce more time constraints into their morning routine by setting the first alarm as late as possible.\n\n\"Ask yourself: Is there anything in that morning routine that you could maybe do without? Or maybe you could find a way to do it faster?\" Robbins said.\n\nSnoozing could also mean you're losing out on time that could be used for adding wakefulness-promoting habits into your morning routine.\n\nThe heaviest snoozers tracked in Robbins' study used around 22 to 27 minutes resting after the first alarm \u2014 time that could be used for stretching, journaling or cooking a nutritious breakfast, Robbins suggested.\n\n\"We talk a lot about wind down routines and bedtime rituals. I think morning rituals are also really lovely to help you get excited about your day,\" Robbins said.\n\n\"It's important to find something to look forward to, whether that's a meeting in the morning, making yourself a cup of coffee, whatever helps motivate you (and) gets you out of bed.\"",

(ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nThe Blue Mountains is a hub for adventure tourism, with 4.4 million visitors each year, according to Destination NSW.\n\nMore than 47,000 of those visitors take part in activities requiring trained guides, according to figures from Outdoors NSW & ACT.\n\nSector concerns over training\n\nWhile ropes training is no longer available through TAFE NSW, students can choose to complete individual units \u2014 or the entire outdoor leadership course \u2014 at private institutions across Australia, with domestic course fees ranging up to $18,600 for the Certificate IV.\n\nBut the site of private training providers can make this complicated, with the closest available to the Blue Mountains located 165 kilometres away in Lake Macquarie.\n\nHugh Ward is an owner and director at the Blue Mountains Climbing School, which relies on part-time and casual staff to run recreational climbing and canyoning courses, as well as guided experiences for school and corporate groups.\n\nMr Ward says he has declined bookings because he can't find enough staff. (Supplied: Sammy Zammit/Thin Air Productions)\n\nHe said the decision to stop ropes training was complicated but was \"choking off the supply line\" of people equipped to handle complex outdoor situations.\n\n\"My sense is that adventure tourism is growing in the mountains, [but] the [training course] places are becoming harder to get,\" he said.\n\n\" [Guides] need exposure to remote places, decision making, risk management, in ways that you can't get in a classroom. \"\n\nHe noted the lack of any fee-free training at TAFE NSW as a primary driver of missing qualifications.\n\nLack of guides an issue\n\nMr Ward described TAFE NSW's consultation with the sector as having \"no straight answers\" and said the characterisation of student demand was not a \"true and accurate representation\".\n\n\"Our day-to-day is OK. Where it gets complicated is when we have a few trips out \u2026 we have to say no to things,\" he said.\n\nTAFE NSW said it had consulted with the adventure tourism industry on the changes as recently as last month.\n\nBlue Mountains Adventure Company manager Andy Mein echoed the concerns and said \"all available guides\" were needed for school programs, with the business \"struggling\" to meet demand for skilled guides with any further growth.\n\nMr Mein said as previous TAFE graduates naturally moved to other areas or jobs, no rope trained guides would fill the void and businesses would be forced to restrict what they could offer.\n\nThough the flow-on effects of restricting visitor numbers were the main economic concern for the sector, Mr Ward said the mental health, risk management and communication skills developed in the outdoors benefited everyone.\n\n\"There's a lot more going on than just the finances of the Blue Mountains adventure sector,\" he said.",

Canterbury boss Phil Gould says the ladder-leading Bulldogs have just about locked up teen star Lachlan Galvin as the teen Tiger appears set for an early release.\n\nFor Galvin's arrival to be secured, both the Bulldogs and Tigers will need to agree on a six-figure transfer fee given the teenager is contracted until the end of next year.\n\nIt is also believed that Galvin will need to address legal claims that he was bullied while at the Tigers, after social media backlash following his decision not to re-sign.\n\nQuestions remain over where Galvin will fit into the table-topping Dogs' team if the move comes to fruition after the club's best start to a season in 23 years.\n\nRegardless, Gould insisted that Galvin's arrival would not cause animosity from other players if he was to take their spot.\n\n\"No. None at all. That's the least of my worries,\" Gould said on the Nine Network's 100% Footy.\n\n\"I don't think anyone denies he is a talent. And you win premierships with talented players. It's my responsibility to get talented players into the club.\n\n\"I think it will create great competition, that's what it'll create if he turns up.\n\n\"He's got talent. Why wouldn't you want a talented player at your football club? And why wouldn't the other players want talent at their football club? They do.\"\n\nIf Galvin does land at Canterbury before next Tuesday, he would be available to face Parramatta, the club he met with, in the King's Birthday public holiday clash.\n\nGould indicated one option for Galvin could still be the back row, with the Bulldogs facing a forwards shortage through a spate of suspensions and injuries.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThere is the potential he could replace Sexton in the halves, or potentially pair up with the off-contract halfback if Matt Burton was moved elsewhere.\n\nBurton has previously won a premiership at left centre for Penrith, while it has also been suggested the playmaker could be a weapon at fullback.\n\nEither of those moves could leave centre Bronson Xerri or fullback Connor Tracey out of the team, depending on how the backline reshuffle would take place.\n\n\"(Where he plays) will be up to the coaching staff. How he comes in and how he trains. How he gets along with the group team-wise,\" Gould said.\n\n\"The more depth you've got in the club, the more talented players you've got, the better.\"\n\nAAP",

A company that manages at least 140 disability homes in Queensland is being accused of making misleading claims to property investors.\n\nThe company argued that dissatisfied investors represented four or five homes out of 150. It maintained the vast majority of investors were happy and the risks were fully disclosed, rejecting any suggestion of misconduct.\n\nThe ABC can reveal Wel.co, a Melbourne-based property development group run by former Essendon midfielder and current club vice-president Andrew Welsh has built specialist disability accommodation managed by NDISP, as has Asia-based finance group OCP Asia.\n\nOther investors came via Australia-based funds.\n\nFamily voices accommodation concerns\n\nFormer soldier Gavin Boggitt has also encountered difficulty with NDISP, whose Townsville-based son Braydon is in a wheelchair with limited speech.\n\nBraydon, 25, was placed in an NDISP administered home in 2023. Since then, Mr Boggitt said he experienced a frustrating lack of communication with the company \u2014 he said they were difficult to contact and multiple people would deal with issues.\n\n\"You didn't know who to talk to from one moment to the next,\" Mr Boggitt told the ABC.\n\nThe problems, he said, included a lack of grab rails in areas including showers.\n\nGavin Boggitt said while the NDIS system was great, problems included things being slow including getting repairs on his son Braydon\u2019s wheelchair. (ABC News: Jonathon Poulson)\n\nAt one stage Mr Boggitt said he told NDISP in writing that Braydon would be leaving, but then the decision was made for Braydon to stay. He said when they contacted NDISP to rescind the departure decision, the company staffer was not even aware that Braydon had planned to be leaving.\n\nWhile Braydon is now in a new home with a new manager, Mr Boggitt said problems still occurred.\n\nMr Boggitt said the government NDIS was a great system overall, but many things ran slowly, including getting repairs for Braydon's wheelchair after 18 months.\n\nThe National Disability Insurance Agency, which oversees the NDIS, said it was boosting the experience for participants via improved processes and increased frontline resources.\n\nUnpaid contractors and software failures add to woes\n\nA lawn mowing contractor working on NDISP properties also told the ABC of struggles in getting paid for invoices to NDISP and a related maintenance company.\n\nIn email correspondence, company staff promised to ensure payments would be made \u2014 sometimes a Christmas backlog was blamed, or new employees were involved in training.\n\nAt one stage, the contractor said the bill from a related company for outstanding work grew to more than $13,000 late last year. While that was mostly repaid, he said, billing recently shifted to NDISP and he estimated a $6,000 payment has become past due.\n\nWhile he does have other work, he said the lack of payment stings.\n\n\"I've got a family to feed \u2026 I've got mortgages to pay,\" he said.\n\nNDISP director Darryl Richards blames issues including an entity the company hired having botched the implementation of a software program. (Supplied)\n\nAsked about client and contractor complaints, NDISP director Darryl Richards blamed issues including an entity the company hired having botched the implementation of a $150,000 enterprise software program for his organisation.\n\nHe also lashed out at the introduction of a sector-wide NDIS billing system, which has attracted complaints across the sector in the past couple of years as a \"disaster\".\n\nHe added his organisation \"always had multiple qualified accountants running the finance department internally\", and payments of subcontractors were handled without NDISP directors being directly involved.\n\nRelationship managers and senior regional staff would have been easily contactable, he maintained.\n\n\"They would have organised someone to install rails etc if they were needed,\" he said.\n\nAmong institutional fund backers of specialist disability accommodation was OCP Asia, which in 2022 announced plans to put up to $200 million, potentially as debt, into the sector, eyeing up to 40 homes in a deal involving NDISP.\n\nIt ultimately contracted NDISP to run an undisclosed number of homes but has declined to answer questions from the ABC about what happened with its investment.\n\nWel.Co Group founder Andrew Welsh. (Facebook)\n\nNDISP also leased multiple properties from Mr Welsh's Wel.co. Mr Welsh declined to comment.\n\nAn unknown number of other investors bought homes run by NDIS through funds run by James Brooker's Social Impact Funds Management and Kevin Nolan's DHI Fund Management.\n\nQueensland land title records show nine properties in the state are owned by Sydney-based Boutique Capital, which is the trustee of the funds.\n\nBoutique Capital, which is run by Tim Baker, the husband of TV star Georgie Gardner, did not respond to the ABC's questions.\n\nAttempts to obtain comment from Mr Brooker were unsuccessful.\n\nMr Nolan said the DHI funds had \"two operational SDA buildings now managed by Sigma with seven out of our 10 apartments occupied\".\n\n\"Please note that DHI Fund Management has not raised capital since 2022 and has no intention to do so,\" he said.",

(Supplied: Citrus Australia)\n\nExport success\n\nHe said production across Australia would be strong in 2025, as well as demand from international markets.\n\nExport demand has been strong enough to potentially break the record tonnage sent out of Australia, which was set in 2019 at 304,000 tonnes and had an export value of $541 million.\n\nChinese markets took the majority of exported fruit, importing 83,000 tonnes.\n\nLast year over 280,000 tonnes of citrus were exported, with a value of $590 million.\n\nMost international markets for citrus sit in Asia, with large volumes going to Japan, China and Thailand as well as the United States, Canada and United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"The fruit size is looking good as well. We need fruit to be of a certain size for it to be in that profitable market range because cost of production in Australia is very, very high,\" Mr Hancock said.\n\nThere's hope this season will produce a bumper crop. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Lucinda Jose)\n\nOngoing challenges\n\nOne of the biggest costs facing growers is wages.\n\n\"Our wage costs have just continued to climb and it's not really aligned with the returns we get,\" Mr Kay said.\n\n\"So that's causing some challenges; we're trying to find ways of increasing production and improving efficiencies.\"\n\nIn his Moora orchard, Mr Kay is implementing a three-hectare trial block of protective netting.\n\nIt has so far proven successful, helping to decrease wind impact and water use.\n\n\"We're doing a cost-benefit analysis of that right now, because it's not cheap,\" Mr Kay said.\n\n\"But there are some really good water savings which is important.\"",

(ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\n'Never say never': Public forum on Hobart stadium a mixed bag Photo shows wide shots of a forum of people speaking. There's continued calls for the Tasmanian government to try to re-negotiate the state's AFL licence deal, amid a public forum over the proposed Macquarie Point stadium development.\n\nBusiness, Industry and Resources Minister Eric Abetz said the government was confident the legislation \"provides the necessary details for the parliament to provide their support\".\n\n\"The government has reviewed and acknowledged the concerns and challenges raised within the draft Integrated Assessment Report by the Tasmanian Planning Commission,\" Minister Abetz said.\n\n\"This draft bill and subsequent planning conditions addresses these points and demonstrate the efforts by the government to ensure the legislation is comprehensive.\n\n\" The enabling legislation and supporting materials are hundreds of pages long, carefully addressing concerns, permits and conditions. \"\n\nAbetz: 'I won't be rubber stamping anything'\n\nPoll reveals support levels for proposed Hobart stadium across Tasmania Photo shows Concept art showing interior of sports stadium with cricket match underway. If it wasn't already official, it is now: The proposed Hobart stadium is massively on the nose among many Tasmanians.\n\nMr Abetz said the permit included conditions requiring \"subject and site-specific expert management plans to be finalised and submitted to the relevant regulator for approval before construction or operations\" can start.\n\nHe said that was standard practice for commercial development approval.\n\nMacquarie Point Development Corporation chief executive Anne Beach said conditions were developed with input from agencies and regulators, Hobart City Council, TasNetworks and TasWater.\n\nMr Abetz said as Minister, he would be issuing the permit for the stadium if the legislation passes.\n\n\"Be absolutely assured I won't be rubber stamping anything, but, as Minister, I will be provided with the capacity to issue the relevant permits, but the legislation will require me to consult with the relevant authorities prior to making a permit,\" he said.\n\n\"From the government''s point of view, transparency's key; we want to ensure that people fully understand what we're doing, why we're doing it.\n\n\" So they can be confident and proud that the stadium that's delivered here will be something that they'll be able to look back on, and scratch their heads and say, 'why was there all this opposition 40 years ago'. \"\n\nThe stadium is a condition of Tasmania's AFL licence, the government says. (Supplied: Macquarie Point Development Corporation)\n\nIn parliament, Greens leader Rosalie Woodruff described the bill as \"draconian\", arguing it would give Mr Abetz \"unprecedented power to unilaterally amend the stadium permit\".\n\n\"You've given him free range to instruct the planning commission to change the planning scheme to facilitate any permit conditions,\" Dr Woodruff said.\n\n\"This legislation is draconian and bringing it to parliament is an utter farce.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if the parliament approves the stadium bill as written, because you've given Minister Abetz full power change it as he sits fit.\"\n\nFunding for concert hall sound proofing\n\nThe government has also agreed to a request from the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO) to soundproof the Federation Concert Hall. The TSO asked for $4.45 million.\n\nMr Abetz said the total cost of the stadium was now estimated to be $945 million.\n\nHe said the figure incorporated \"improvements that will enhance the stadium user experience to better cater for a wide range of planned uses, including helping facilitate cricket at the venue\".\n\n\" It also accounts for detailed items such as audio-visual, communications, kitchen, and food and beverage fit-outs. \"\n\nIt is not clear whether the $4.45 million for the TSO is included in the $945 million figure.\n\nQuestions over cost\n\nDid the premier break his 'not a red cent more' promise? Photo shows Jeremy Rockliff with a football. The definition of a \"red cent\" and a qualification of the $375 million in taxpayer money for the planned Hobart stadium matter when determining if the premier has broken his word.\n\nIndependent MP Rebekah Pentland took aim at the growing cost of the project, asking in parliament how Tasmanians could have faith the latest cost estimate was \"even in the ballpark\".\n\n\"The stadium was originally costed at $715 million with your government promising to cap its contribution at $375 million not a red cent more now \u2026 we learnt the price tag has blown out to $945 million,\" Ms Pentland said.\n\n\"That still doesn't include the cost of critical infrastructure like road access and sewerage works.\n\n\"Why should Tasmanians believe you can build a new stadium at Macquarie Point for less than a billion dollars?\n\n\"The new berth for the Spirits at Devonport was originally going to cost $90 million now the estimate is a massive $493 million.\"\n\nJacqui Lambie Network MP Andrew Jenner asked the government what kind of precedent it was setting.\n\n\"In just two years your government has introduced, and is planning to introduce again, special legislation to fast track major projects involving massive amounts of public money,\" he said.\n\n\"These laws bypass Tasmania's normal planning processes and in at least one case was brought forward after the original proposal was rejected through the proper channels.\n\n\" It would seem that it isn't about cutting red tape, it's just a simple way of making it easier for this government and developers to get their own way. \"\n\nConversations with cricket bodies continuing\n\nCricket Tasmania and Cricket Australia have raised concerns about the stadium roof, saying daytime games could not be played at the stadium in its current form.\n\nMr Abetz said the government was \"confident we can sort these issues out with cricket\".\n\nAnne Beach says the Macquarie Point Development Corporation is working working with cricket bodies. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nMs Beach said the Macquarie Point Development Corporation was continuing to work with Cricket Tasmania and Cricket Australia.\n\n\"The last thing we need to work through is the roof, and we know that there are a few challenges around the shadows,\" Ms Beach said.\n\n\" We've gone and looked at other venues and looked at how they've managed those, and found that the dispersed nature of the shadow is quite minor when you experience it on the field. \"\n\nShe said decisions about the materials to be used were still being made.\n\n\"We're looking at building a test rig on site so that cricket can have confidence in what we'll build and they'll know we can manage this issue.\"",

    "text": "Terence Crawford has never been to Australia before.\n\nThat might seem a little strange.\n\nThis is a man, after all, who was in tentative talks to fight Australian Tim Tszyu at one stage.\n\nHe is also the man who comprehensively out-fought Jeff Horn and took his WBO welterweight belt in 2018.\n\nWhen Horn won that particular belt in a boilover victory against Manny Pacquiao at Lang Park, Crawford was keen to be in attendance as a future opponent for the winner.\n\nAt that stage of his career, Crawford was already a world title winner at lightweight and unified champion at light welterweight.\n\nSo what gives?\n\n\"Well, I always wanted to visit Australia,\" Crawford tells ABC Sport, a smile lighting up his face.\n\n\"Australia has been on my bucket list for a long time now.\n\n\"I remember when Jeff Horn fought Manny Pacquiao I was supposed to come here and witness, but Top Rank said that my visa didn't get granted because of parking tickets.\"\n\nSeemingly, that's no longer an issue.\n\nTerence Crawford is making the most of his trip to Australia. (Supplied: Press Run/Ian Reyno)\n\nCrawford was speaking to ABC Sport on the Gold Coast, the first leg of his whistlestop tour of Australia with events in Sydney and Melbourne to come.\n\nJust hours after touching down in the country for the first time, Crawford was amenable and relaxed as he settled down on a couch ahead of our interview, displaying no signs of jet lag.\n\nIn fact, the 37-year-old's relaxed, friendly demeanour is almost incongruous with what the world knows he is capable of in the ominous squared circle where he has made his name one to both admire and fear.\n\nThis is a man who has a perfect 41-0 record in the unforgiving glare of the boxing ring over a 17-year professional career. But, in so many ways, Crawford is a multi-faceted athlete, both in the ring and out.\n\nCrawford's home town of Omaha, Nebraska, was not an easy place to grow up.\n\nCrime, poverty and violence were daily issues young people had to face.\n\nMany people still have to face them.\n\nTerence Crawford was relaxed during his interview with ABC Sport. (Supplied: Press Run/Ian Reyno)\n\nSo, much in the same way he was saved from a troubled life by the peculiar sanctuary found within a boxing ring, he has provided a space for others in his home town to do the same.\n\n\"What I'm doing with B&B Sports Academy is definitely trying to save one life at a time,\" Crawford says, leaning forward such is the earnestness with which he tells his tale.\n\n\"You know, if I could save one [person], then I did my job.\n\n\"Now, you're not going to be able to save all of them. Once some individuals get to a certain age, they're going to find their way in life and do whatever they want to do.\n\n\"You, as a mentor, you can do it all, you can do everything that you can to help them stay on course and just give them talks and the guidance so that they would remember everything that you taught them along the way and do the right thing.\n\n\"But another thing is giving them the opportunity to experience things that they normally wouldn't be able to experience because of financial reasons and other things.\n\n\"So this thing that me and Brian McIntyre has been doing with B&B Boxing and B&B Sports Academy has been wonderful for the youth in the community as well.\"\n\nTerence Crawford has walked the same walk so many of the kids he is now trying to help are doing. (Supplied: Press Run/Ian Reyno)\n\nBoxing's capacity to assist wayward youths is well documented, wresting lives from the brink of the abyss and pushing them into untold glory.\n\nThere are far more instances where boxers have not reached the heights of a world championship or an Olympic Games \u2014 and the issues fighters face after their career can be unspeakably devastating.\n\nYet, it is a journey that has brought such incredible success for Crawford and established him as one of the all-time greats.\n\nWhen he stunningly took Errol Spence Junior apart across nine phenomenal rounds in 2023, Crawford became an undisputed world champion in a second-weight division.\n\nTerence Crawford is undisputed at welterweight. (Getty Images: Al Bello)\n\nHe had, earlier in his career, beaten unified light welterweight champion Julius Indoingo in 2017 to claim all four straps at light welterweight too.\n\nBeing undisputed is not normal. In the four-belt era since 2008, just 11 men and 11 women have been so heralded.\n\nBeing undisputed across two weights is virtually unheard of.\n\nOnly Japanese sensation Naoya Inoue (bantamweight and super bantamweight) and Ukrainian talisman Oleksandr Usyk (cruiserweight and heavyweight) \u2014 aside from Crawford \u2014 have achieved it in men's boxing.\n\nLegendary Irishwoman Katie Taylor (lightweight and light welterweight) and Claressa Shields (middleweight, light middleweight and heavyweight) of the USA have done so in the women's ring.\n\nFew fighters in boxing history have been more skilled, more adaptable, in a ring than the man from Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nEver since he won his first world title, the WBO lightweight crown, in a tinderbox atmosphere in Glasgow in 2014 against Ricky Burns, right through to his light middleweight victory against Israil Madrimov last year, Crawford has transferred his power, his speed and his trickery through the weight classes.\n\nTerence Crawford will be the smaller man against Canelo, but has carried his power through the divisions. (Getty Images: Al Bello)\n\nBut up next is Canelo \u00c1lvarez in a fight that could be one of the highest-earning pay-per-view fights in history and one of the most eagerly anticipated contests ever.\n\nLike Crawford, Canelo is a four-weight world champion and is currently undisputed at super middleweight.\n\nCrawford has made it his business to out-think and out-match all of his previous opponents, but Canelo poses an entirely different challenge. He has already beaten one of the 11 undisputed champions in his career, former light middleweight champ Jermell Charlo in 2023.\n\n\"It's important to me because it's a challenge, in two ways,\" Crawford says.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"It's a challenge because I'm fighting arguably one of the best Mexican fighters of all time and then it's a challenge because I'm moving up potentially three weight classes.\n\n\"I say three because I was only at 154 [pounds, light middleweight] for one fight.\"\n\n\"It's the opportunity to do something that no other men's fighter has done before and \u2026 to become a three-weight undisputed world champion.\"\n\n\"I want him at his best,\" Crawford says, confirming there's no rehydration clause in the contract, meaning Canelo may well be several kilos heavier when they meet in the ring.\n\n\"Because I don't want no excuses when I win.\n\n\"[If] I get him at his best and there's no stipulations or guidelines, then I get more credit than, you know, having all these rehydration clauses and all this stuff.\n\n\"He's the champion. I'm moving up to fight him in his division, so long as he makes weight, that's what it is.\"\n\nAnd what would victory mean?\n\n\" I would say I'm in the conversation with the greatest. \"",

(ABC Alice Springs: Emma Haskin)\n\n\"We don't have a grave or anything,\" Mr Shaw said.\n\n\"So this is the closest thing we have to it.\"\n\n\"We filled it with decorations.\n\n\"The base was covered in flowers and filled with valuable mementos and photos.\n\n\"A lot of the stuff were personal items of his that we took from his house and left it for him.\"\n\nHe said he was shocked by the removal.\n\n\"I felt disrespected and it feels that Alex's memory had been disrespected and insulted,\" he said.\n\n\"The whole year has been trying to keep the [memorial] alive, trying to keep it going especially for his mother.\"\n\n'We've let them down'\n\nCouncil director of technical services, Joel Andrew, said the council had provided an apology to Ms Marchant and to her son's friends.\n\n\"We've let them down \u2026 by not contacting them and trying to work through and find a solution to the concerns,\" he said.\n\nFriends lay flowers at the roadside memorial for their friend Alex Marchant-Powell. (ABC Alice Springs: Emma Haskin)\n\nMr Andrew said there was a roadside memorial policy which dictated the size, shape and makeup of memorials.\n\n\"[Staff] said it was outside of the policy and removed it,\" Mr Andrew said.\n\n\" Part of that policy is to contact the family members and try and find a mitigation to concerns of residents and in this case that wasn't done. \"\n\nHe said at least two complaints had been received for Mr Marchant-Powell's memorial.\n\n\"I think it was an effect on the nearby residents and also the distraction towards drivers [as it] was quite lit up at night with fairy lights and it's causing concern for residents,\" Mr Andrew said.\n\nMr Andrew said the council would work with Mr Marchant-Powell's family and friends to ensure the memorial was reinstated.\n\n\"We've offered to try and mitigate the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"I understand her son's friends have some things they'd like to put in place for the one-year anniversary and we're trying to assist with that and make recompense as much as we possibly can.\"",

    "text": "Nadine Ensor always suspected she would delay sending her daughter, born in June, to school.\n\n\"She was very advanced with language and the standard things they check off, like being able to count and recite the alphabet, so I had no doubts academically she could have gone [when first eligible],\" says 36-year-old Nadine, based in Brisbane/Meanjin.\n\n\"For me, [the motivation to delay] was definitely more the emotional side of things.\"\n\nRegulations around the age children start school vary across Australia, and between public, Catholic and independent schools.\n\nTypically, however, children born in the first part of the year can be sent to school in either the year they turn five or the year they turn six.\n\nIf Nadine's daughter started school when she was first eligible, she would have been four and a half, and one of the youngest in her class.\n\n\"I also worried about the social aspects, and also fatigue,\" Nadine says.\n\n\"If she was starting school when [she was] four and a half, she would just be too burnt-out.\"\n\nPreparing if you have a child with disability starting school Photo shows A child wearing a navy backpack and uniform holding her mum's hand as they walk into school. For parents of children with disability, worries about how their child will transition into school can be heightened. But there are ways to help manage it.\n\nTwo-thirds of parents delaying if they have the option\n\nNew research from Macquarie University found that of Australian parents who could choose when to send their children to school, 66 per cent planned for them to start later.\n\nThe study surveyed 226 parents.\n\nCo-author Penny Van Bergen, an associate professor of psychology in education at the university, said one of the most interesting findings was that academic concerns didn't typically play a role in parents' decision-making.\n\n\"A lot of international research says academic competitiveness is why you might hold a child back, but there wasn't a sense [parents in Australia] were making those choices for competitive reasons,\" Dr Van Bergen says.\n\nSocial and emotional readiness\n\nLike Nadine, many parents are concerned about their children's social, emotional and behavioural readiness for school, Dr Van Bergen says.\n\n\"Whether a child would make friends, be able to sit still \u2014 parents were seeing that as a sign they are probably not ready and won't enjoy themselves if they are still developing those skills.\"\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nRebecca English, a senior education lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, says parents may also be concerned about their child needing a nap or rest time, and other factors such as whether the child has toileting accidents.\n\nFamily time and milestones\n\nAnother motivation for Nadine delaying her daughter's schooling was the family dynamic.\n\n\"I had a newborn that year, so I didn't want the whole commitment of school alongside a newborn as well,\" she says.\n\nShe also wanted to spend more time with her daughter, a desire shared by some parents surveyed in the Macquarie University study.\n\nWanting to spend more time together is one motivation for parents delaying their child's schooling. (Pexels)\n\nDr Van Bergen says there is a philosophy of \"they are really little, let them enjoy life, there's plenty of time for school\".\n\n\"They recognised they were privileged to make that choice, but talked about wanting that extra 'gift of time'.\"\n\nParents were also considering milestones ahead, such as when their children would reach the ages they could drive and drink.\n\n\"We don't want them to be the last to get their drivers licence,\" Dr Van Bergen gives as an example.\n\nFinancial pressures\n\nBecause early childhood education and child care are more expensive than public schooling, some parents felt they had to send their child \"on time\", Dr Van Bergen says.\n\nWork demands also played a role.\n\nCan you challenge a school's uniform policy? Photo shows three school kids running through grounds From hair length to skirt length, school uniform policies, or dress codes, dictate many aspects of a student's appearance. But how enforceable are they?\n\nGender\n\nBoys are more likely to be \"held back\", Dr Van Bergen explains, due to \"beliefs about boys not being social and emotionally ready\".\n\nParents she surveyed were almost four times as likely to report they intended to start boys later than girls.\n\n\"There is a narrative that boys are less mature, or less developed, than girls that floats around, and that drives parents' decision-making,\" Dr Van Bergen says.\n\nShe says while at a group level there are school-readiness trends that favour girls, on an individual level there is a \"huge overlap\" between genders, so readiness really needs to be considered case by case.\n\nPhysical size\n\nParents reported concerns about physical size, usually more with boys than girls.\n\nThis is particularly in the context of bullying and \"sporting prowess\", Dr Van Bergen says.\n\nFeeling unsure?\n\nSome parents are concerned their children will be smaller than their classmates. (Adobe Stock)\n\nFive per cent of the parents surveyed by Macquarie University said they were still unsure about when to send their child to school.\n\nDr English says it can be hard for parents to know what to expect from school because things will have changed a lot since their years of education.\n\n\"Talk to the school. Talk to your peers. If you have a psychologist or occupational therapist or speech therapist, talk to them as well,\" she says.\n\n\"If you are on the NDIS, talk to your providers.\"\n\nShe says it can also be helpful to ask relatives and friends with older children about their experience, as well as instructors of the child's extra-curricular activities, such as swimming.\n\nDr Van Bergen says parents should follow their instincts.\n\n\"School teachers do an amazing job to support children and bring them into a different educational context, but it's still a big transition,\" she says.\n\n\" Trusting your gut is important. \"\n\nShe recommends parents avoid being \"fatalistic\" about their decision.\n\n\"If there are any education gaps between younger and older children to start with, [research shows] it closes over time.\"\n\nNadine says she \"100 per cent\" made the right decision by delaying her daughter's schooling.\n\n\"There is so much pressure on prep and so many commitments \u2026 it's full on.\"\n\nThis is general information only.

    "text": "Most women in 19th-century Europe were encouraged to learn the piano as a way to attract husbands, but it was never intended that they would pursue a career in music.\n\nDespite these constraints, Clara Wieck Schumann became a concert pianist and composer.\n\nClara Schumann gave her debut concert when she was nine years old.\n\n\"She was really a pioneer with so many things,\" says Australian pianist Andrea Lam, one of the judges in the new ABC iview series The Piano.\n\nMany are still inspired by Schumann\u2019s life story and music today.\n\nBorn in Leipzig, Germany in 1819, Schumann made her debut when she was nine years old.\n\nShe later married fellow pianist and composer Robert Schumann, becoming his musical partner and staunchest advocate.\n\nAfter her husband\u2019s death, Schumann supported her family by touring as a concert pianist, teaching students and mentoring younger composers. Some became lifelong friends.\n\nHer father\u2019s prodigy\n\nWhat's your favourite music for the piano?

Tell us your favourites and we'll count down Australia's top 100 choices across June 7 and 8 on ABC Classic and the ABC listen app.\n\nClara Schumann\u2019s father, Friedrich Wieck, was a self-taught musician who sold pianos and ran a music-lending library. Her mother was a well-known singer and pianist as well as Schumann\u2019s first teacher.\n\nWhen the couple separated, Schumann remained under her father\u2019s custody.\n\nWieck devised his own methods to teach the piano, and Schumann was his model student, who he used to shore up his reputation.\n\nHer daily routine was planned to the minute.\n\nWieck would give his daughter a one-hour lesson on the piano as well as violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. On top of this, Schumann was expected to do an extra two-hours practise on her own.\n\nIn later life, Schumann wrote: \"[My father] was exceedingly strict, that he reprimanded me when I deserved it and in so doing, prevented me from becoming arrogant from the praise the world showered on me.\"\n\nHer future husband Robert Schumann was impressed with Schumann's talent after seeing her perform as a nine-year-old. He took lessons from her father, living in their house for a year.\n\nBy her mid-teens, Schumann had toured all over Europe to perform piano recitals under her father\u2019s management.\n\n\"Recitals, where people bought tickets to hear a pianist or [other instrumentalists] perform in a public auditorium, were a new concept in the 19th century,\" says Andrew Ford,host of The Music Show.\n\nSchumann was admired for her musical interpretations, which she played from memory, unlike most of her fellow performers. One Austrian poet even wrote a poem called \"Clara Wieck and Beethoven\" after hearing her play the Appassionata Piano Sonata.\n\nSchumann\u2019s relationship with her father broke down when he refused to give her permission to marry Robert Schumann, resulting in months-long legal battles.\n\nThe young couple won their case in court and married a day before Schumann's 21st birthday in 1840.\n\nMusical partner and champion\n\nSchumann premiered her first piano concerto at the age of 16 under the baton of renowned composer Felix Mendelssohn.\n\nRobert and Clara Schumann often composed together in the early years of their marriage (Getty: Hulton Archive)\n\nAfter their marriage, Robert and Clara collaborated musically for many years. But Robert\u2019s physical and mental health deteriorated soon after.\n\nTouring to Russia in 1844 exhausted him.\n\nAs Robert continued to decline, Clara began to take the role of the family\u2019s breadwinner through performing and teaching.\n\nRobert committed himself to a mental asylum in 1854 and died two years later, leaving Clara a single mother of seven children.\n\nSchumann reforged her earlier career as a concert pianist, giving public performances at home and overseas.\n\nFord says: \"The idea that you can buy a ticket to sit in a large auditorium listening to a great pianist play Bach or Beethoven owes a lot to Clara Schumann.\"\n\nSchumann was the first performer for many of her husband\u2019s compositions. In later life, she premiered many piano pieces by Johannes Brahms, who became a close friend of the family.\n\nThere are over 1,300 preserved concert programs which detail the music she performed in recitals between 1831\u20131889.\n\nChampioning Clara Schumann\n\nAlthough Schumann did much to champion other composer\u2019s music, even making them staples of classical music concerts, her own compositions were rarely performed after her death.\n\nBut Schumann is far from being forgotten.\n\nIn Germany, there are streets named after her in Berlin, Leipzig and other cities. Before the introduction of the Euro in 2002, Schumann was featured in one of Germany\u2019s notes for the 100 Deutsche Mark.\n\n\"She\u2019s not lost, but I think she needed to be rediscovered,\" says British pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason.\n\nGet ready to stream the Classic 100: Piano in Concert Photo shows A conductor getstures on stage. Stream the Classic 100 in Concert on Saturday 21 June from 7.30 pm on ABC TV and ABC iview.\n\nTo mark Schumann's 200 birthday in 2019, Kanneh-Mason recorded an album of her music, including the piano concerto Schumann premiered as a young woman.\n\nThat same year, her birth town in Leipzig organised a festival to honour her life and music.\n\nThe town had a memorial plaque to mark the place where she was born, and her marital home is now a museum and music school dedicated to both Clara and Robert Schumann.\n\nKanneh-Mason was inspired by Schumann\u2019s life story when she chose to record her music.\n\n\"Not only did she manage to sustain a long and demanding concert career, she also raised a large family and dealt with inconceivable tragedies,\" Kanneh-Mason says.\n\nSchumann also has a young torch-bearer in ABC iview's The Piano.\n\nJust like Schumann, \"I practise everyday,\" says 12-year-old Stefania, one of the younger performers in the series.\n\n\"I think of the piano as an extension of my soul and body,\" Stefania says.\n\nAfter wowing judges Harry Connick Jr and Andrea Lam with her flawless performance of Bach's English Suite No. 2, Stefania was invited to perform for the Finale concert.\n\nStefania performs music by Clara Schumann in The Piano's finale, mentored by Lam, who herself was a prodigy, debuting with the Sydney Symphony aged just 13.\n\n\"It's really important to be able to identify with your idols and with people that you respect,\" Lam says.\n\n\" To have Clara Schumann as a beacon for us is phenomenal. \"\n\nStream The Piano free on ABC iview or watch Sundays at 7:30pm on ABC TV.\n\nVote for your favourite piano music in the Classic 100: Piano and hear what made the top 100 across June 7 and 8 on ABC Classic and the ABC listen app.\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

    "text": "Farmland has increased in value more than any other Australian property type over the last two decades, a report has found.\n\nThe Australian Property Institute's (API) inaugural valuation report shows the value of agricultural land has increased by 256 per cent since 2005, compared to 154 per cent for housing over the same period.\n\nThe strongest growth was recorded in western Victoria's Wimmera region, where land values have skyrocketed by more than 800 per cent amid demand from the renewable energy, grain and grazing sectors, according to the report.\n\nAmelia Hodge says the results of the study might not be expected by some. (Supplied: Amelia Hodge)\n\nAPI chief executive Amelia Hodge said it was surprising to some that farmland had outperformed metropolitan property categories.\n\n\"It's really interesting that the Wimmera region has come out the winner over 20 years,\" she said.\n\n\"Agricultural land has come out nationally as the best performing category.\"\n\nThe API says the Wimmera topped the table for the highest percentage increase in farmland value. (Supplied: Australian Property Institute)\n\nAdelaide tops housing growth\n\nAustralia's smaller capital cities outpaced Sydney and Melbourne in housing value growth over the last two decades.\n\nIn Adelaide prices rose by 175 per cent since 2005 and by 172 per cent in Hobart.\n\nSydney residential property prices grew by an average of 171 per cent during that time.\n\nPrices in Brisbane and Melbourne increased by 169 per cent.\n\nAdelaide house prices increased by 175 per cent in 20 years, according to the API report. (ABC News: Viki Ntafillis)\n\nInflation rose by 67 per cent over the same period.\n\nThe API report drew its comparisons using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Suburbtrends and Colliers Edge.\n\nThe Gold Coast was the top performing regional residential market and six other Queensland regional cities were in the top 10.\n\nThe Gold Coast had the biggest increases in property values of all regional cities. (ABC Gold Coast: Cathy Border)\n\nFrom despair to prosperity\n\nWimmera-based real estate agent Nick McIntyre said it used to be hard to sell farmland in the region.\n\n\"You look back 20 years and we were in the middle of the Millennium Drought and prices were going nowhere,\" he said.\n\nElders real estate agent Nick McIntyre has 40 years' experience in the business. (Supplied: Nick McIntyre)\n\nMr McIntyre said a \"perfect storm\" of low interest rates, strong commodity prices and favourable seasons had driven prices up.\n\n\"We saw property prices double and double again \u2014 and in some instances double again \u2014 from about $1,000 to $2,000 to $4,000 to even $8,000 an acre,\" he said.\n\nThe API report noted the rise in the value of farmland in the Wimmera was also driven by the conversion of land into solar farms.\n\nBut Mr McIntyre disagreed with that assessment and attributed the growth to production capacity.\n\n\"Seasons are very reliable and even in the driest of years they can almost always get some sort of crop, whereas that's not always the case in other areas,\" he said.\n\nHigh prices bring challenges\n\nMinyip farmer Ryan Milgate said the swing towards grain growing and away from livestock production had boosted prices.\n\n\"The change in our farming systems and our ability to successfully grow crops like lentils, I think, has underpinned why the Wimmera is such a sought-after cropping area,\" he said.\n\nRyan Milgate says land value is just \"a number on a piece of paper\" for intergenerational farmers who don't plan to sell. (ABC News: Sean Warren)\n\nBut Mr Milgate said high land values had put a lot of pressure on those who had expanded and he expected prices to flatten out.\n\n\"The capital value of the land doesn't reflect the capacity of the land to produce, so one of the real issues is there has been a real squeeze in return on investment,\" he said.\n\n\"It's important to note the vast majority of farmers are here for the long-term and the capital value of our land is just a number on a piece of paper.",

    "text": "Millions of dollars belonging to retirees who have prepaid funerals through a charity could be in jeopardy amid an investigation from WA's consumer watchdog.\n\nRetirees WA (RWA) has thousands of mostly senior members and operates retirement villages and aged care facilities across Western Australia, social programs for seniors, and a scheme for discounted funerals.\n\nBut money from the charity's prepaid funeral fund has been tied up in a maze of loans and investments into companies linked to Frank Pinner, the husband of RWA's former chief executive officer Margaret Thomas.\n\nThe charity is now pursuing legal action against Mr Pinner and his companies to try to recoup millions of dollars. Mr Pinner has filed a defence denying that any monies are owed.\n\nMillions flow from funeral fund\n\nMargaret Thomas is the Mayor of Kalamunda, and ran unsuccessfully for the Liberals in the 2005 state election.\n\nMs Thomas led Retirees WA for almost two decades. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nA few months after the election loss, she became Retirees WA's chief financial officer, and was also appointed its chief executive officer in 2007.\n\nMillions of dollars started flowing from the charity into loans and investments, with the approval of the boards at the time.\n\nMs Thomas's husband, Frank Pinner, was a director of the company which received the investments, ASIC records show.\n\nFrank Pinner has been paid to build Retirees WA's retirement villages and aged care facilities. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nThe money for all the investments and loans came from Retirees WA's funeral fund, where millions of dollars are held in trust on behalf of members who have prepaid their funerals.\n\nAs of the last financial year, the charity had $6.6 million worth of prepaid funerals. Its most expensive funeral package is $4,279 \u2014 or about 1,500 prepaid funerals.\n\nA web of money\n\nThe charity's financial reports show it invested $1.6 million in 2005 into Mr Pinner's building company, Over 55 Lifestyle Villages Pty Ltd, and another $2.8 million the following year.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe charity also loaned $1.8 million to Mr Pinner's company in 2006, which the company used to buy a property.\n\nRetirees WA then paid $4,315 per month, growing to $9,200 per month by 2015, to lease part of the property back as office space.\n\nMr Pinner's company sold the property for $3 million in 2016, and paid the $1.8 million loan back to the charity.\n\nRWA's financial reports do not state the charity received the $1.2 million profit from the sale of the property.\n\nCharity sues\n\nMs Thomas stepped away from her dual roles at Retirees WA early last year.\n\nShe and Mr Pinner both declined requests for interviews and did not answer written questions about Mr Pinner's financial links to the charity.\n\n\"Those questions are based on numerous factual inaccuracies, and imply a number of imputations which are false,\" a letter from their lawyer said.\n\nMargaret Thomas was re-elected Mayor of Kalamunda in 2023. (Supplied)\n\nBut the lawyer refused to clarify the \"inaccuracies\" and said it would be inappropriate to respond to questions relating to ongoing legal proceedings.\n\nNone of the transactions detailed above are part of ongoing legal proceedings and the ABC is not suggesting any wrongdoing by Ms Thomas or Mr Pinner in relation to any of them.\n\nRetirees WA was founded in 1933 as the Invalid and Old Age Pensioners' Association. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nRetirees WA is suing Mr Pinner and his companies over what it claims is a default on a $1.5 million loan made to his company in May 2017, and another $1.5 million loan made in November 2020.\n\nMr Pinner denies the allegations.\n\nThroughout Margaret Thomas's tenure at RWA, building contracts for the charity's retirement villages and aged care facilities were approved by the boards to be given to companies operated by Mr Pinner.\n\nLinks to former auditor\n\nThe charity's financial web stretches beyond husband and wife.\n\nPast financial reports show Graeme Wovodich was RWA's external auditor in charge of scrutinising the charity's finances for a decade during Ms Thomas's tenure, when he worked as a director with Armada Accountants & Advisors.\n\nGraeme Wovodich has been an auditor for more than three decades. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nThe ABC understands Mr Wovodich left his firm in 2018, which resulted in him losing Retirees WA as a client.\n\nA year later, a $4.8 million investment from the funeral fund in one of Mr Pinner's companies was transferred to Retirement Village Developments Pty Ltd, a company directed by Mr Wovodich.\n\nHowever, the investment in Mr Wovodich's company has been \"fully impaired\" in the charity's latest financial report, which means the $4.8 million has been deemed irrecoverable and the investment revalued at $0.\n\nGraeme Wovodich also declined a request for an interview, and did not respond to written questions.\n\nRed flags\n\nMembers of Retirees WA have been raising questions about the charity's financial management for years.\n\n\"What absolutely amazes me, I find it utterly bewildering \u2026 they were allowed to do this for years,\" member Susan Burns said.\n\nSusan Burns and other RWA members have scoured through the charity's financial documents. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\n\" How can you run a charity like that? \"\n\n\"There was a resident in here who unfortunately has since died ... he was really concerned about the funeral fund. A lot of people got told, 'don't leave your money in the funeral fund'.\"\n\nLetters from Ms Burns show she alerted WA's consumer watchdog about the charity's financial management as early as 2016 and also complained to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission.\n\nMs Burns says she's concerned about the charity's ability to stay solvent. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\n\"We were just ignored,\" she said.\n\nIn mid-2021, Consumer Protection formally started investigating the governance of Retirees WA.\n\nRetirees WA changes\n\nThe consumer watchdog says its ongoing investigation is \"highly complex\", and it will provide information to families once it is finished.\n\nConsumer Protection says it's focused on protecting the interests of RWA's members and retirement village residents. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nRetirees WA's new CEO Henrietta de Sa was the charity's funeral fund manager when some of the loans and investments were approved using money from the fund, but said she was not involved in the decisions.\n\nShe said changes had been made in the organisation's management structure since Ms Thomas left to ensure the board \"has more insight over all our financial decisions and over the organisation as a whole.\"\n\nHenrietta de Sa stepped in as interim-CEO after Margaret Thomas's departure, and was officially appointed CEO this year.

(ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\n\"When you're talking about red flags, yes we would worry a bit about for-profits and non-profits entering into related party transactions,\" Professor Murray said.\n\nHe said it could be difficult for the federal regulator \u2014 the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) \u2014 to have a clear picture of whether a related party transaction might be a cause for concern.\n\n\"The reporting is all about 'have you got related parties?' \u2026 but in a charity setting, that's not the worry. It's a secondary question about 'have we got private benefit flowing to someone?',\" he said.\n\nProfessor Murray says there are gaps in charity regulation which should be addressed. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nProfessor Murray said a recent Productivity Commission inquiry into regulation of the charity sector recommended giving more enforcement powers to the federal regulator, including against individuals.\n\n\"Charities exist for the public benefit,\" Professor Murray said.\n\n\"It's going to be people in need, or others who charities are meant to be serving, who are the ones that suffer when we have governance failures in the charity sector.\"",

    "text": "How can F1 make the Monaco Grand Prix an exciting race?\n\nIt is a simple question, seemingly without an answer.\n\nMonte Carlo's narrow streets and slow and tight corners, combined with the long and wide cars of modern F1 make overtaking near impossible.\n\nFor decades, it has led to races that more resemble processions. A parade of race cars, rather than cars racing.\n\nMonaco Grand Prix soured by 'silly' deliberately slow driving Photo shows Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Williams FW-47 on track during Lando Norris has survived an early scare and a tense finish to win his first Monaco Grand Prix, a race that threatens to be remembered for slow, negative driving.\n\nBut this year's race went from dull to borderline comical, and it may have taught F1's front office an important lesson \u2014 F1 is best when it is organic.\n\nThe Monaco Grand Prix is the jewel in the crown for F1.\n\nIt is the race every driver wants to win and every fan wants to attend.\n\nBut the race itself is arguably the worst of the year and F1 wanted to change that.\n\nEvery driver was mandated to pit twice on Sunday. The hope was for teams to come up with varied pit strategies and add excitement and unpredictability to the race.\n\nWhat fans got was the exact opposite.\n\nThe combination of needing to stop twice, and overtaking being impossible around Monaco, led to drivers deliberately driving slow to help their teammates.\n\nDespite a new pit stop mandate, the usual gridlock of cars during the Monaco Grand Prix continued in 2025. (Getty Images: NurPhoto/Alessio Morgese)\n\nTeams instructed drivers to go slow, holding up rivals, while their teammates could race clear, complete their stops, and then emerge on track still in front of the gaggle who were slaving behind a deliberately slow car.\n\nIt was confusing, dull and the exact opposite of what a race is.\n\nA mandate that was hoped to produce one of the best races in recent years, actually led to one of F1's worst races.\n\nAnd there is a lesson for organisers in this.\n\nIn the wild world of F1, simplicity is great and organic excitement is better than manufactured fun.\n\nDespite years of boring races, hundreds of thousands still attended and tens of millions still watched at home.\n\nF1 fans knew what they were getting into, because they love the product for what it is.\n\nAt its core F1 is simple; build a fast car, employ a quick driver, and complete the race as soon as possible.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThat is how F1 has always been, and that is what has made it so popular.\n\nThe series had an enormous following around the world for decades, and the simplicity of the sport allowed everyone to enjoy it.\n\nNetflix got involved and gave F1 a popularity surge that it still enjoys now.\n\nBut even Netflix knew audiences would enjoy the simplicity of F1.\n\nThe early seasons focused heavily on the plight of backmarker teams, desperately trying to score just one, crucial and all-important championship point.\n\nThey were driving, to survive. Simple.\n\nIt was this simplicity that was sorely lacking in Monaco on Sunday and all it achieved was confusing the audience.\n\nThe intention from F1 was commendable. There is little doubt F1 was thinking of its fans when it introduced the pit stop mandate.\n\nBut when excitement and fun are forced, it is never as good as when it comes naturally.\n\nSomething race winner Lando Norris summarised well on Sunday.\n\n\"I think Formula 1 should not turn into just a show to entertain people. It's a sport. It's who can race the best, who can qualify the best,\" he said.\n\n\"The last thing I want is manufactured racing, and I think we definitely need to stay away from that and do a better job with cars, with tyres.\n\n\"Then you might start to see more racing, but not by just introducing so many pit stops.\"\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris celebrates with a trophy on the podium after winning the Monaco Grand Prix alongside third-placed Oscar Piastri and McLaren chief executive Zak Brown. (Reuters: Stephanie Lecocq)\n\nF1 has new technical regulations from 2026, meaning next year's cars will be vastly different to 2025.\n\nThe next generation of cars is hoped to allow for better wheel-to-wheel racing.\n\nWill this translate to on-track battles in Monaco? More than likely not.\n\nBut fans have proven over the decades that they enjoy the product as it is.\n\nFans don't need pit stop mandates or funky rules.\n\nFans want fast cars, great drivers and a compelling story that plays out without interference.\n\nAnd when F1 gets that right, it is a beautiful sport to watch.",

People living with both can feel misunderstood\n\nExpensive to diagnose the distinct conditions\n\nAccording to Australia's government-funded service Healthdirect, autism spectrum disorder, or autism, is a developmental condition that affects a person's interaction with the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile ADHD \u2014 also a developmental condition \u2014 includes symptoms of being easily distracted, impulsive and overactive.\n\n\n\n\n\nErin, who has both conditions, said she had to go through a long process to confirm her diagnoses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In my early 30s, I got the autism diagnosis first, and had found out other family members had ADHD, and I noticed that both of those conditions apply to me, so when I started seeing a psychiatrist, I asked her if I could be assessed for ADHD,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding her diagnosis has helped Erin create strategies to navigate life better. Source: SBS News / Cameron Carr For Erin, the process of receiving both diagnoses involved separate and expensive evaluations, with some overlap but largely distinct assessments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The tests are pretty separate, and it's expensive. It was somewhere about 12.5 per cent of my entire yearly salary,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tamara May, a clinical psychologist specialising in autism and ADHD, told SBS News \u2014 getting an autism or ADHD diagnosis in Australia is challenging \u2014 let alone receiving both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For ADHD, most people will see a psychiatrist who wants to access the most evidence-based treatment, which is stimulant medication, and that's very restrictive. You have to go privately,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To do an autism diagnosis, usually it's going through a psychologist who has expertise in the developmental conditions and diagnosing autism, and that can also, if it's done privately, can cost a lot, and for adults, it's generally just done privately.\"\n\n\n\nMay said it could be around $1,000 for a single appointment.\n\n\n\nConditions can come with a 'significant amount of disability'\n\nNicole Rogerson, CEO of Autism Awareness Australia, a not-for-profit autism education and awareness organisation, said people need to be careful about what they've read on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A wider amount of people now self-identify as being on the autism spectrum and potentially having ADHD,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whilst we want to embrace that idea that neurodiversity has got a positive message behind it, it's crucial to understand that these conditions are very serious, and for a decent proportion of the community, it will come with a significant amount of disability.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Social media reshaping the lines between Autism and ADHD SBS News 26/05/2025 07:53 Play\n\nRogerson said the key is to ensure quality services are provided, whether it's for people with only one or both conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is really important is that we have good quality diagnostic services across the country and that people are getting quality assessments. It's not merely ticking a box by seeing somebody you know online for telehealth,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If somebody has a legitimate diagnosis of ADHD, their life may be vastly improved with the help of medication. So it's important that we get the diagnosis right so we can get the right support for those people.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's the government doing?\n\nEarlier this year, the government launched its first national autism strategy with the aim to improve the lives of autistic people and dismantle harmful attitudes barring their participation in society.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strategy, which will inform the federal government's policy approach, will run until 2031 and aims to bring Australia in line with countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Federal government unveils Australia's first national autism strategy\n\nSome states are also looking at making ADHD diagnosis cheaper and more accessible for people.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2017, the Queensland government has allowed GPs to diagnose and prescribe ADHD medication to children.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the NSW government also announced that the state's GPs would be able to diagnose ADHD and prescribe medication for both children and adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to 1,000 GPs would first receive training before taking on the new responsibility, but the details of the training and the rollout are yet to be confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Rebekah Hoffman, the NSW and ACT chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, said the reform makes it easier for existing ADHD patients to access prescriptions, while reducing stigma around mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What it also means is hopefully there's a reduced wait list for getting into paediatricians and psychiatrists if we're able to go on and manage some of their complex but stable patients that don't need to see them as regularly.\"\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / Lukas Coch \"The legislation will cut 20 per cent off your student debt and backdate it to 1 June, before indexation was applied,\" Clare said in a statement to SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a game-changer for the more than three million Australians with a student loan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means the indexation that is applied on 1 June will be re-calculated by the Australian Taxation Office after the measure comes into effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese changes apply to several student support loans including HELP, VET Student Loan and the Australian Apprenticeship Support Loan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legislation should be passed quickly, breezing through the lower house where Labor holds 94 seats, and the upper house, where Labor and the Greens hold a majority.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Labor floats plan targeting Morrison-era policy that hiked university course fees\n\nThe Greens are expected to vote for the changes as they supported wiping all student debt during their election campaign.\n\n\n\nHow much will the average Australian save?\n\nUniversity students and graduates will have roughly $5,500 cut from their student debts as a result of the changes,\n\n\n\n\n\nHECS-HELP debt, which grew to roughly $80 billion in 2023-24, is considered a debt recovery measure instead of a revenue stream for the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a graduate with $50,000 in student loans, their debt will be wiped by $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reduction is on debts as of 1 June, so Australians who voluntarily decide to pay off their debts before this date will not be reimbursed.\n\n\n\nWhat's next in Labor's student repayment reforms?\n\nThe minimum repayment threshold for student loans will also be raised on 1 July, offering cost-of-living relief for younger Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose with student debt will start repaying their loans once their income is above $67,000, instead of the current $54,000 threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount you pay will no longer be a percentage of your income but instead will be a marginal repayment, as recommended by the Australian University Accord.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor someone earning $70,000, the compulsory repayment will be reduced by $1,300 annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measures are a recognition that course fees have increased \u2014 spiking under the Morrison government's Jobs-ready Graduates package \u2014 and younger Australians are paying high fees at a time when they are also looking to buy their first homes and start a family.\n\n\n\n",

For all the families that are reconnecting to their own motherlands, I want you to know that I see you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's the voice of Jie Pittman, speaking at the event in Parramatta, an area where the first school for Aboriginal children was built in 1814.\n\n\n\n\n\nDharug knowledge holder Julie Jones Webb says the trauma of the Stolen Generations is embedded in this institution's history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What they didn\u2019t tell us is when we put our children in the Parra Native Institution that on those documents that we couldn\u2019t read is that our ancestors marked an X on was a notation that we would never, ever, be able to take our children back home again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry Day marks 28 years since the landmark Bringing Them Home report was tabled in federal parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report detailed how thousands of First Nations children were forcibly removed from their families under what was government policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Pittman says Sorry Day is a chance for all Australians to confront this history and the harm caused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Acknowledgement is our economy and the knowledge of what we know. To have so many more Australians in acknowledging helps with the next steps of healing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are around 17,000 stolen generations survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendants at the Parramatta event were encouraged to join dance and weaving workshops, to celebrate the strength and survival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people and culture, and keep culture alive for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Brisbane, song and dance were part of Sorry Day events, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharron Mirii Bell, founder of Aboriginal organisation Indigenous Insights attended the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the removal of children has caused immeasurable damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have no idea how anyone in their right mind would ever think that it would be a possibility, or an idea, to take babies away from their families, their homelands, from their language, their food source, their connection to country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bringing them Home report handed down 54 recommendations to support reconciliation for our Stolen Generations, and 28 years on - only 6 per cent of them have been implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Nations children still make up around 45 per cent of those in out-of-home care, despite making up 7 per cent of the children's population.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Australia marks National Sorry Day it also marks the beginning of reconciliation week, which runs until the 4th of June.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt says it's a chance for politicians to recognise that concrete action is needed to address ongoing disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't matter which government is in, I've seen over my lifetime, governments talk about the issues of need, the gaps, the levels of disparity, the incarceration rates, and when they're in opposition they're very strong on some of that language. But what I;m also seeing in that period, is when in government, Aboriginal affairs is not the priority.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAboriginal elder Tom Calma says reconciliation is facing a battle for support from politicians and public alike, especially after last year's failed Voice to parliament referendum.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says the movement for reconciliation is growing stronger, and needs continued support.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "General practitioners in NSW will soon be able to diagnose and treat people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) under reforms announced by the state government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) and ADHD advocates have backed the reforms, unveiled on Monday, making NSW the third state to move on implementing changes to improve treatment access.\n\n\n\n\n\nADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that can affect both children and adults. Over one million, or an estimated one in 20, Australians live with ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent Senate inquiry found factors such as where people live, cost, stigma, gender and cultural and linguistic background, along with different prescribing regulations across states and territories, was impacting access to assessment and support.\n\n\n\nCurrently, most people seeking a diagnosis, management and ongoing prescription for ADHD must see a specialist \u2014 a psychiatrist for adults and a paediatrician for children.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is often extremely expensive and many patients wait months or years for a diagnosis, or can't access treatment at all, the NSW government said.\n\n\n\n'Hoping to break the cycle'\n\nUnder the reforms, up to 1,000 GPs will be able to provide ongoing ADHD prescriptions for children and adults who are on stable doses of medication.\n\n\n\n\n\nA smaller number of GPs will be able to diagnose and initiate medication where appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder both scenarios, GPs will need to undertake accredited training and will receive support, the government said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns said the government is \"hoping to break the cycle of people having to wait years for, what can be, a life-altering diagnosis\".\n\n\n\nMental Health Minister Rose Jackson said the reforms are the \"much-needed relief\" families have been hoping for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is about fairness \u2014 saving families hundreds of dollars and giving them quicker access to the help they need, without the long, expensive wait for a specialist,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToo many families are stuck waiting, paying, and struggling to access basic ADHD support \u2014 especially in the regions. That\u2019s not just frustrating, it\u2019s fundamentally unfair.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor children and families managing ADHD, she said the difference between getting help now and waiting years \"can be life-changing\".\n\n\n\nNSW follows Queensland, Western Australia\n\nUnder Queensland legislation, GPs can prescribe certain medications for children under the age of 18 to treat ADHD without approval.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of the WA state election in March, the government reportedly proposed reforms allowing specialist GPs to diagnose and treat patients, along with additional training in ADHD diagnosis and management.\n\n\n\nLast December, the federal government adopted one of the Senate inquiry report's recommendations, to expedite the development of uniform prescribing rules to ensure consistency across state and territory jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was one of 15 recommendations made by the committee. The government gave \"in principle\" support to nine others.\n\n\n\n'Life-changing impacts'\n\nRACGP NSW & ACT chair Dr Rebekah Hoffman said she has heard about families in rural areas travelling more than seven hours to see a paediatrician, and families in Sydney spending more than $5,000 on assessments and diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis announcement will have life-changing impacts when it comes to accessing timely and affordable ADHD care for families across the state,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said early intervention is vital, and enabling GPs with specific skills to start prescriptions for ADHD medications \"will stop many children from languishing on outpatient waiting lists\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGPs in many parts of Australia, and around the world, are already diagnosing ADHD and prescribing medications. Our colleagues in Queensland, for example, have been safely prescribing ADHD medications since 2017.\"\n\n\n\nThe Australasian ADHD Professionals Association (AADPA) welcomed NSW's reforms, which it says will improve access to care, cut waiting times and bring down costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it stressed that education and accuracy must remain central to the rollout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe expansion of GP roles in ADHD care is a positive and necessary step \u2014 but it\u2019s essential that we keep accurate diagnosis at the heart of this process. Getting it right matters for every child, every adult, and every family involved,\u201d said AADPA president, professor David Coghill.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NSW government will seek expressions of interest from GPs to undertake education and training, funded by NSW Health, in the coming months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reforms will be introduced in stages, with GPs expected to be able to provide ongoing prescriptions for children early next year.\n\n\n\n",

The producers of the movie Conclave must have been counting their blessings, as viewers were drawn to their fictionalised version just as the real event was unfolding.\n\nIt made me think that many families go through their own kind of conclave after the death of a parent. There might be a will appointing an executor \u2013 hopefully \u2013 but what if that person is no longer suitable, perhaps due to ill health, estrangement, or simply being overwhelmed?\n\nThe papal conclave lasted just two days and involved 133 experienced cardinals. A family conclave may be far less public, but it can be just as fraught. Credit: AP\n\nThe papal conclave lasted just two days and involved 133 highly educated and experienced cardinals. Throngs packed St Peter\u2019s Square and millions watched online.\n\nA family conclave may be far less public, but it can be just as fraught. Someone has to arrange the funeral, draft the death notice, and write the eulogy \u2013 often amid simmering tensions. These decisions can be especially sensitive in blended or second families, where loyalties and histories collide.",
