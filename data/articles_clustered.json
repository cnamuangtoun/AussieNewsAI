    "text": "For five years, Aidan McManus has been suffering from a mystery illness, which has come to dominate his life.\n\nIt began when the 22-year-old from North Melbourne was just 17 and in his final year of high school, his mother Angela McManus told 9news.com.au.\n\nThe first sign of the condition came when Aidan began to lose some of the feeling in his feet.\n\n\"He came to me and said his feet were feeling tingly and numbish,\" his mother said.\n\nAidan McManus and his mother Angela, pictured on the day of his high school graduation. (Supplied: Angela McManus)\n\nAidan's feet then began to swell, and his worried mother took him to the GP.\n\n\"The doctors said it was fluid retention and put him on some tablets, but they didn't work,\" Angela said.\n\nAidan soon began to find the simple act of walking painful, his mother said, adding it was \"like he was walking on little tacks\".\n\nAt the same time, Aidan had also been diagnosed with post-viral irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which made his health needs even more complex.\n\nDespite only managing to attend around five weeks of year 12, Aidan persevered and managed to complete his high school certificate, Angela said.\n\nThe strange numbness in Aidan's feet slowly became worse and he was referred to a neurologist who ran a battery of tests in a bid to find out what was happening.\n\nOver the past three years, Aidan's neurologist had exhausted every possible avenue, his mother said.\n\n\"They must have done 20-odd blood tests. They cut a piece of nerve out of his leg to do a biopsy on it. They did a lumbar puncture and genetic testing - none of these tests showed up any answers.\"\n\nWhat was clear was that Aidan's nerves were being affected. He was ultimately diagnosed with a generalised nerve disorder - axonal peripheral neuropathy - which disrupts how nerve cells transmit signals throughout the body.\n\nBut with no clear cause able to be identified, Aidan's family were told his condition was likely to get worse, and he would possibly end up in a wheelchair.\n\nAngela McManus, pictured with her son Aidan, who has a mystery illness affecting the nerves in his feet, legs and hands. (Supplied: Angela McManus)\n\nUnfortunately, this has proved to be true, and over the past few years, the lack of feeling had moved up his legs and into his hands, his mother said.\n\n\"We were told it will eventually go to Aidan's hands. We were thinking that might happen 10-15 years down the track, but one night, Aidan came to me and said, 'Mum, I picked up my can of Coke and my hands felt like they were on fire'.\"\n\n\"If he holds something cold, it feels like his hands are burning. And if he picks up something hot, it's like it's freezing.\"\n\nThe baffling condition had affected all aspects of Aidan's life, she said.\n\n\"For those obvious reasons, he can't cook. He's got to be very careful. When I do give him meals I've got to say, 'It's really hot, or it's really cold.\n\nHis ability to walk, as well as his balance and co-ordination had all been affected, she added.\n\n\"He can walk, but not very far, and because of it all, he's put on quite a bit of weight.\"\n\nThings had been made harder after Aidan's application for NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) support had been rejected last November, Angela said.\n\nIn a letter seen by 9news.com.au the NDIA (National Disabilty Insurance Agency) said Aidan did not meet the requirements for funding under the scheme because had had not \"examined all possible treatment options\".\n\nHowever, in a letter provided by his neurologist to the NDIA as part of his application, also seen by 9news.com.au, the specialist specified that there were no treatments available.\n\nAidan's condition was progressive and very unlikely to resolve, the neurologist said.\n\n\"He has a diagnosis of axonal peripheral neuropathy, which is progressive in nature and at this stage, after extensive investigation, no cause has been identified. He has had no treatment for this apart from pain relief because there is no treatment available,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"I would strongly support him being eligible for inclusion in the NDIS as I believe that he has an incurable disability and will continue to worsen.\"\n\nAidan McManus has undergone years of tests, but he and his family are still waiting for answers about what is causing his debilitating condition. (Supplied: Angela McManus)\n\nAngela said the NDIS decision did not make sense.\n\n\"We have tried everything and its upsetting and frustrating. NDIS just tick boxes to say 'yes' or 'no'. I'm sure they don't have a neurologist to give a correct answer,\" she said.\n\nAn NDIS spokesperson said: \"To meet access for the NDIS, a person must meet all the eligibility criteria, including permanency.\n\n\"A review of all evidence provided to the NDIA regarding Aidan's conditions and support contained inconsistent medical advice as to treatment options and so the permanency requirements could not be satisfied.\"",

(ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nFor the average Australian, which ABS figures show use about half a tank of fuel per week, the saving would be closer to $7 per week.\n\nThe 12-month policy comes at a cost of $6 billion to government coffers.\n\nWhile the Coalition's offering the 12-month discount on fuel, it's also vowed to reverse legislated tax cuts passed by Labor on the eve of the election.\n\nThose two \"modest but meaningful\" tax cuts by Labor would hand about $5 a week back to taxpayers from July 2026 and a total $10 a week back from July 2027.\n\nIt'll mean the average worker gets just over $268 dollars extra in their pocket in the first year and $536 each year after that, costing the federal budget $17.1 billion in the first four years.\n\nWhich major party's tax policy leaves you better off? Photo shows A graphic showing Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton with bowser pumps, in front of a background of hundred dollar bills. A policy fight over cost-of-living relief has emerged with a federal election looming.\n\nDespite scrapping those cuts, the Coalition's pledging up to $1,200 of your \"own money back\" as a tax rebate to everyone earning less than $144,000.\n\nBilled as the Cost of Living Tax Offset, the Coalition says it will provide \"temporary and targeted\" cost-of-living relief.\n\nIt'd be paid in a one-off lump sum at tax time in July 2026, with anybody with taxable income between $48,000 and $104,000 getting the full amount, and those earning below $48,000 or between $104,00 and $144,000 getting a smaller offset.\n\nLabor's also promising a $1,000 instant tax deduction, which it says will provide cost-of-living relief and make tax time easier.\n\nIt means people can instantly claim that $1,000 deduction on their taxes for work expenses like uniform or equipment, without providing receipts or getting professional tax advice.\n\nA similar measure is already in place up to $300.\n\nBut that sum won't land in your bank account \u2014 the $1,000 will be deducted from your taxable income, and Labor's estimating the average amount of annual tax relief will be about $205.\n\nAnd you can try our tax calculator for a rough idea of how these measures might impact you.\n\nMaking GP visits cheaper\n\nBoth parties have policies to make healthcare cheaper.\n\nThe centrepiece of Labor's healthcare re-election pitch is to tip $8.5 billion over four years in Medicare and expand the bulk-billing incentive, in an ambitious effort to make nine out of every 10 GP visits free for patients by the end of the decade.\n\nLabor says that will be the single largest investment in Medicare since its inception more than 40 years ago, and the Prime Minister has gone to great lengths to flash his green Medicare card as many times as possible during the campaign.\n\n\"No Australian should have to check their bank balance to see if they can afford to see a doctor,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said when announcing the policy.\n\n\"That is not who we are. That is not the future we want for Australia.\"\n\nAnthony Albanese has frequently pulled out a Medicare card during the campaign. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nThe bulk-billing incentive is a payment aimed at encouraging doctors to bill Medicare directly, when patients have no out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe 'secret weapon' for Labor MPs this campaign Photo shows a graphic of a female doctor wearing glasses in front of an emergency department sign Just like Oprah's iconic \"you get a car\" moment, Labor is throwing urgent care clinics to punters like confetti.\n\nThe government's tripling of the incentive currently only applies to a smaller cohort of the population like children and concession card holders.\n\nThe Coalition has promised to match Labor's bulk-billing promise \"dollar-for-dollar\", in an effort to lift bulk-billing rates, although it's refrained from committing to the 90 per cent bulk-billing target.\n\nThere's deep scepticism within the sector about whether the government's plans to make 9 out of 10 GP visits free will come to fruition.\n\nThe Coalition will also match Labor's $690 million promise to slash the price of medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from $31.60 to $25, a saving that is set to save Australians $200 million a year.\n\nMany GPs say they won't be able to move to full bulk-billing under the proposed changes. (Flickr: Alex Proimos)\n\nThose who access mental health services could also see a savings, with the Coalition planning to reinstate the number of Medicare-funded mental health sessions from 10 to 20 per year, if elected.\n\nThat's part of the Coalition's $400 million pledge for youth mental health services.\n\nLabor's promising to offer free and immediate mental health as well through a $225 million pledge to build or upgrade 31 walk-in Medicare mental health centres, which is part of a $1 billion promised investment into mental health services.\n\nYou can read a full breakdown of the health promises here.\n\nThe price of energy\n\nA key component of the Coalition's cost-of-living plan is its gas reservation policy, which would force exporters to divert supply to the domestic market.\n\nMr Dutton is promising that households would see a reduction in their gas and electricity bills.\n\nThe Coalition says it will work to bring down gas prices. (ABC News: Natasha Johnson )\n\nThe Coalition's modelling by Frontier Economics says residential gas bills could be cut by 7 per cent in 2026, while household electricity bills may go down by around 3 per cent.\n\nMr Dutton insists that policy would also make items like groceries cheaper, by driving down the cost of energy for business.\n\nIt's the energy election everywhere, but nowhere quite like the Hunter Photo shows Fingal Bay The Liberals and the Nationals are both eyeing off working class seats that were once unquestionably Labor territory, but has the Coalition's nuclear policy blown wind farms out of the water as an issue for voters?\n\nLabor hasn't articulated a plan to permanently bring down power prices for all households during the campaign, but ahead of the election, extended its energy rebates until the end of 2025, providing another $150 in energy bill relief.\n\nThe Coalition supported the extension, so that rebate will stay no matter which party gets elected.\n\nBut for those with solar panels or considering rooftop solar, Labor is offering a 30 per cent discount on installation of a home battery.\n\nIt argues the subsidy will cut $4,000 from the cost of a typical battery, and up to $1,100 on the average annual power bill.\n\nTAFE fees, HECS and more\n\nFor those Australians paying off their HECS loans, Labor has committed to wiping 20 per cent off everyone's student debt, and lowering repayment rates to help with the hip pocket for more than 3 million current and former university students.\n\nThe average university graduate with a debt of $27,600 would see about $5,520 wiped from their outstanding loan next year.\n\nLabor also wants to make free TAFE permanent: around 100,000 fee-free TAFE places a year would be offered from 2027 if the legislation passes under a re-elected Labor government.\n\nLabor has committed to wiping 20 per cent off everyone's student debt.\n\nBefore the election, Labor also passed legislation to provide parents a guaranteed minimum three days of subsidised childcare, abolishing the 'activity test' that requires parents to be working or looking for work to access subsidies.\n\nIt says families earning between $50,000 and $100,000, are expected to save $1,460 a year on average.\n\nMr Dutton's suggested the Coalition would cut fee-free TAFE if elected, arguing the program isn't a good use of taxpayers' money.\n\nGraduates in 'debt vortex' as HECS loans front and centre in election Photo shows A young white man with short brown hair and glasses sitting with a middle aged white woman with long blonde hair New research shows a sharp rise in HECS debts, despite graduate earning power declining, as student loans become a potent election issue for the first time.\n\nThe Liberal party also confirmed it would not proceed with Labor's 20 per cent student debt-reduction plan \u2014 Coalition education spokeswoman Sarah Henderson told the ABC the policy was \"elitist and unfair\".\n\nThe three-day guarantee of subsidised childcare could also be wound back by the Coalition, with Mr Dutton saying the activity test for parents would be reinstated.\n\nAs for savings at the supermarket check-out, both Labor and the Liberals are pointing to the now-mandatory Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, which regulates conduct between groceries and suppliers, and contains penalties for supermarket giants.\n\nBut fairer prices for suppliers might not mean much for the hip pocket of consumers.\n\nLabor's committing to make it illegal for supermarkets to price-gouge customers if re-elected.\n\nCoalition campaign spokesman James Paterson said his party would be \"happy to make [price gouging] illegal\", but the Coalition had a better plan to create divestiture powers that could be used to break up the supermarket giants if they were behaving anti-competitively.\n\nLoading\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

    "text": "Every possession in football is important, but some are more important than others.\n\nMost of the focus goes to the last possession \u2014 the one that ends in a goal, behind, turnover or stoppage. But often it's the first \u2014 or first clear possession \u2014 from stoppage that can separate the good from the bad across the league.\n\nAFL teams throw tremendous resources around how to transition the ball from the inside to the outside and up the field effectively.\n\nLast week the Western Bulldogs delivered a lesson on how important this is. The Dogs pounded GWS into submission through scoring from stoppages.\n\nThe Dogs won 22 more clearances than GWS, despite both teams winning about the same number of first possessions.\n\nThe Dogs have been the most damaging team from stoppage this year, winning plenty of the ball and scoring at will.\n\nSo what's really important to teams in the stoppage, and what can be hidden by the noise around the ball?\n\nManuka nights\n\nIn the aftermath, GWS coach Adam Kingsley was quick to identify the biggest gap between the two sides.\n\n\"In its simplest form \u2026 stoppage tonight was quite disappointing. They're an outstanding stoppage team, with a lot of really great stoppage players. We failed to cope with that at all, which was incredibly disappointing,\" Kingsley said.\n\nDigging a bit deeper beyond raw numbers can tell us why. While much of football commentary is focused on who has the ball, the importance of the other 35 players often gets ignored.\n\nWhere those other players stand, how they move and how they interact with each other can separate great teams from merely good.\n\n\"They were able to win that ball and then use their shape \u2014 which they are fantastic at \u2014 and we failed to compete with them on the inside,\" Kingsley said.\n\n\"They have really great balance around the stoppage or the contest to maximise their time and space they created.\"\n\n\"Using shape\" is a phrase often used in footy circles but often skimmed over in explanations to the broader audience.\n\nRyley Sanders has been a big improver in the Bulldogs's midfield this season. (Getty: Mark Metcalfe/AFL Photos)\n\nIn this sense, Kingsley refers to the placement of the Dogs midfielders in the clutches of the contest. Rather than having multiple players chasing themselves out of position to try to win the ball, the Dogs showed patience to hold spots as second or third receivers from the scrum.\n\nJames Ives knows the ins and outs of stoppages better than most. The Queensland-based football analyst was a mainstay in the VFL and NEAFL for almost a decade, and captained Queensland at under-18 level. During his time playing and observing footy, Ives understood what worked in the middle and what was superfluous.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"If your team doesn't win the ball immediately, you've got to hold shape. Holding shape to maintain balance around the contest is critical,\" Ives said.\n\n\"Not every stoppage ends with clear possession, so that if the ball is loose, you can win the ball or neutralise the spill. If they do get the ball, you can start to apply pressure to make the exit hard.\"\n\n\"It's really important to manipulate the body position of an opponent. For example, owning their back, driving them under the contest or even turning them 360 (degrees) so they lose sight of the contest.\n\n\"This further increases the odds that you'd win or at least neutralise the contest, as well as feeding into the next layer which is the secondary contest, post-clearance. If you maintain a healthy shape and dominant body position, your odds of winning the race to the post clearance contest increases.\"\n\nThe opposite to holding shape is \"collapsing in\". That is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 getting sucked in by the loose ball rolling on the ground or in opposition hands. Holding shape can take time to practice and a lot of patience to master.\n\nThere's also little to no data collected or available about the importance of shape. It's hard to collect information about the lack of interaction with the ball, or the player with it.\n\nInstead, it's something that needs to be seen in action to be believed.\n\nWinning the ball\n\nWinning the ball first is one thing, but turning first possessions into something meaningful is something else altogether.\n\n\"Ideally, your team's first possession should try and engage contact to release your teammates or you should burst away into space. Those players and teams who do neither struggle to impact scoring.\" Ives said.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nThat decision, and the ability to create doubt in opposition players, is critical to making the most of winning the ball. Some players like to change up between modes, while others try to make the most of just one tool.\n\nSome players, such as Clayton Oliver and Tom Green, absorb a lot of early contact and use their large frames to fight through opposition bodies to get clean handballs out. Other players, such as Chad Warner and Max Holmes, like to use their foot speed to burst away from opposition to create space for their teammates.\n\nDifferent teams tend to have different preferences when it comes to how they exit as well. The two most successful teams from clearance \u2014 the Dogs and Suns \u2014 have different approaches when looking to draw opposition sides in. The Dogs like to use the ball early, with the Suns often try to burst through that first wave.\n\nBoth approaches have been successful so far this year.\n\nMore important than picking one tool or another is being in sync with what your teammates are doing \u2014 especially those newer to the midfield mix.\n\nLearning on the job\n\nMost AFL players entering the system do so as superstars of the junior game who often have the game revolve around them, winning the ball at will. The jump to learn a more defensive or team oriented part of the game can take some young players years to master.\n\nBulldogs coach Luke Beveridge said the importance of teaching his young players the value of being balanced post-game.\n\n\"Yeah it's ultra-important. You know the kids who come in go on this really steep learning adventure.\"\n\nMost players coming into the league start in auxiliary positions as they get the pace and feel for the game at the top level.\n\nJoel Freijah has been another find for the Dogs in the middle. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\n\"From junior to senior football there's two themes that stand the test of time \u2014 an increase in speed and an increase in force,\" Ives said.\n\n\"This means that the tricks or weapons that work at one level suddenly don't work at the next.\"\n\nThe journey for them to learn the importance of space, structure and balance can take time.\n\n\"So Ryley Sanders last year, his first experience at playing senior footy. (He was a) high possession winner in his age group \u2026 highly talented, very capable. He's learned some things and now the balance in his game is getting better and better \u2014 and I'm talking about a second-year player there.\" Beveridge adds.\n\nThe Bulldogs, through the necessity of early season injuries, have been forced to insert youth into the contest. With the all-conquering Marcus Bontempelli and talismanic Adam Treloar missing time early, young players such as Sanders, Joel Freijah and Rhylee West have increasingly been inserted to critical roles in the middle.\n\nIt's been a trial by fire, but a successful one, as the stars of the junior ranks have learned to play a more measured role at the top level.\n\nHow to adjust\n\nSo if the Dogs were dominating the contests so much, why didn't GWS adjust?\n\nWell, that's easier said than done most of the time.\n\n\"So you have different plans around 'OK, they are getting on top.' You know we can try and square them up, we can send more numbers in, we can take more numbers out to try and change the look of it. But the reality was they were dominant and we didn't hold up.\" Kingsley said.\n\nFrom the outside it often looks like teams and coaches set their methods early, but the little tweaks to instruction can often be hard to observe. Sometimes \u2014 like last week in Canberra \u2014 that's because they don't work.\n\nBut the important thing to remember is that it's not just when you are struggling that you need to think about adjusting, but also when you are doing well.\n\nThe Bulldogs have also significantly improved their clearance game as the season has progressed. Their coach puts it down to that ability to create uncertainty in the opposition.\n\n\"I think you're always making alterations on the run. You know the thing about stoppage work and the uncertainty in there is you got to turn it into certainty for yourself,\" Beveridge said.\n\n\"The art of good stoppage play is being good at being proactive. So you've got to keep changing it up because the opposition see what you do.\"\n\nThe emphasis on variety \u2014 in both personnel and movement \u2014 alongside the importance of patience might just be the critical component to effectively winning the hardest of hard ball in the AFL in 2025.",

We need to allow more building. \"\n\nInvestors consider selling amid tax break talk Photo shows Sold With negative gearing and capital gains tax back on the national agenda, experts say such reforms would be unlikely to lead to a major fall in property prices.\n\nDr Tulip also criticises demand-side measures like first home buyer incentives, arguing they could raise prices.\n\n\"The lucky recipients will go to auctions and bid up prices \u2014 so they may benefit, but everybody else will face more expensive housing,\" he said.\n\nDr Tulip says both major parties' policies are mixed, with some supply-side measures like infrastructure investments outweighing smaller demand-side initiatives.\n\nThe Grattan Institute also wants to see planning restrictions eased, noting in its paper that \"Australia's land-use planning rules are highly prescriptive and complex\".\n\nIt points out that Australia has among the least housing per person of any OECD country and is one of only four OECD countries where the amount of housing per person went backwards over the past two decades.\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

(ABC News: Michael Coggan)\n\nTim Harcourt, an economist at the University of Technology Sydney, agreed the wealth disparity between generations was becoming increasingly acute.\n\n\"It's really starting to bite now as the Baby Boomers retire into their defined benefits superannuation schemes and extra properties,\" he said.\n\n\"I think housing is a red button issue \u2026 and that's where the youth reaction will be really important.\"\n\nYoung voters 'a ticking time bomb'\n\nDr Strangio said voters typically became more conservative as they grew older, but now they're skewing further to the left and feeling increasingly dissatisfied with the major parties.\n\n\"Young voters are a ticking time bomb,\" he said.\n\n\"They're facing real wage declines, high costs for education, difficulty in getting into the housing market and yet so far I think they've been quite tolerant.\"\n\nYoung voters slam housing policies Photo shows A smiling, dark-haired young woman in flared jeans stands in bare feet on a house veranda.

Australian Venue Co operates venues including Melbourne\u2019s Beer DeLuxe at Fed Square, St Kilda\u2019s revitalised Hotel Esplanade and Brisbane spots The Boundary Hotel and Lefty\u2019s Music Hall. The partnership may raise some eyebrows in bartending circles, at least privately. The group is more associated with sprawling pubs than singular cocktail bars. While the bar locations in Melbourne and Brisbane are under wraps, comments from Australian Venue Co suggest they\u2019ll be slotted inside existing venues. Hehir said the focus was on delivering craft cocktails and a New York-inspired bar experience \u201cwith the same welcoming atmosphere our pubs are known for\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Flying high or calling last drinks: What\u2019s happening with your favourite Melbourne bars? Rob Libecans of Caretaker\u2019s Cottage, ranked No. 21 on the latest World\u2019s 50 Best Bars list, thinks the Australian venture is a great sign of things to come. \u201cA rising tide lifts all ships,\u201d he said. \u201cProven operators [coming in] with a history of success, a deep level of experience and training opportunities for Australian hospitality workers can only be a benefit to Melbourne.\u201d Matthew Linklater, a former manager at Black Pearl in Fitzroy who now works in hospitality consulting, agrees. \u201cDeath & Co entering our market is a huge vote of confidence in the Australian cocktail scene, which has historically been among the world\u2019s best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also great news for classic cocktail drinkers after a tough couple of years of bar closures. Their no-nonsense approach to modern American classics ... is reminiscent of The Everleigh or Romeo Lane, two venues which, once gone, left large dry martini-shaped holes in Melbourne\u2019s \u2013 and my \u2013 heart.\u201d Related Article Three Australian bars named in the World\u2019s 50 Best Bars for 2024 Meanwhile, Death & Co has a new bar set to open in Seattle, too.

Then came a record unbeaten run for a new coach \u2013 for those who saw the first Australian to manage a Premier League side as their sign to follow the club, there was only joy.\n\nNext came a scratchy, mixed period: a respectable, Europa League-qualifying finish in the first season. As the second progressed, occasional highs - thumping away wins against both Manchester teams - gave way to consistent lows, including home defeats to Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nFinally, came the real suffering: a second half of the season afflicted by injury and painful losses (don\u2019t mention north London rivals Arsenal), capped by a 5-1 defeat to title-winners Liverpool \u2013 a team meant also meant to be in a rebuild \u2013 equalling a club record for the most losses in a campaign.\n\nFor many of the new Australian Tottenham fans Postecoglou brought in, it\u2019s too late - they say they\u2019re hooked.

    "text": "However, Jones cuts a different figure to the combative coach I\u2019ve come to know while covering rugby for the best part of a decade, including a Rugby World Cup final in 2019.\n\nHerald reporter Tom Decent interviews former Wallabies coach Eddie Jones, who is now in charge of Japan. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nThat we\u2019re sitting opposite each other in Sydney on the morning of Anzac Day would surprise many.\n\nIt is our first proper interaction since December 2023, when I flew to Tokyo to grill Jones as he was unveiled as Japan\u2019s new rugby coach at a packed press conference, after months of repeated denials.\n\nWe are in the final moments of a 45-minute interview at an ocean pool cafe in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nThese are words I never expected to hear from Eddie Jones.\n\nI apologise, mate. Serious. I didn\u2019t try to piss you off mate, but you know, I probably did treat you unprofessionally, so I apologise mate.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nDoing a straight news story from an interview with Jones didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nI have had a rocky history with Jones, particularly given that story. Jones repeatedly and publicly questioned my integrity, prompting plenty of online trolling.\n\nJones is now Japan\u2019s head coach, having denied links to the job more than a dozen times.\n\nJones eventually resigned with four years left on his contract after a disappointing Wallabies performance saw them knocked out in the pool stages of a World Cup for the first time in their history.\n\nIn 2023, during the World Cup in France, the Herald broke the story that Jones, who was then the Wallabies coach, had taken part in a Zoom interview for the Japan job just before the start of the tournament.\n\nSo, how did we get here?\n\nGiven that background, I was initially reluctant when asked by my sports editor to approach Jones for this interview.\n\nI asked Jones why he\u2019d sent the message and never heard back. He blocked my number.\n\nJones felt the line of questioning was too negative. The team had lost all four matches that year as they headed off for the World Cup.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever contact me again,\u201d he texted me out of the blue, minutes after a press conference at Sydney airport during which he told journalists to \u201cgive yourselves uppercuts\u201d.\n\nA WhatsApp message Jones sent to me on August 17, before the World Cup, sums up our fractious relationship at rugby\u2019s showpiece event.\n\nI will probably always be associated with Jones. There was a time when it was all anyone wanted to talk to me about.\n\nEarlier this month, Jones coached Japan\u2019s under-23s rugby side against Randwick, the club he grew up playing for.\n\nWas this his way of opening the door?\n\nOne day, I opened up WhatsApp and noticed I could see Jones\u2019 profile again (a picture of his dog). He had unblocked me.\n\nMaybe for an interview. Perhaps a quiet drink. But I was still blocked.\n\nOccasionally, I had contemplated reaching out to the coach I used to be on a text-message basis with.\n\nTo be honest, I thought it was more likely that I would replace Joe Schmidt as Wallabies coach than Jones agree to meet up for a chat.\n\n\u201cOk, yes, can do mate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know you [are] doing your job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know we spoke briefly yesterday. My editors wanted to see if you would be up for a sit-down interview and some photos if you are still in town.\u201d\n\n\u201cG\u2019day Eddie, it\u2019s Tom Decent,\u201d read my text message to Jones a few days later on April 16.\n\nAt full-time, a group of rugby journalists huddled around Jones to grab some quotes. I joined in, but was in no mood for a fight, so asked only one question.\n\nWallabies great Simon Poidevin joked to onlookers that the half-time entertainment would be Jones and me with boxing gloves on.\n\nBefore the match at Coogee Oval, we shook hands near the grandstand, but didn\u2019t exchange words.\n\nAlthough it was my day off, and I had an early morning half-marathon planned, we agreed to meet at 9am at Wylie\u2019s Baths; a beautiful ocean pool that looks over Coogee Beach.\n\n\u2018Did you bring your swimmers?\u2019\n\nI arrive before Jones. I don\u2019t know what to expect and can\u2019t say I\u2019m looking forward to it.\n\nThere\u2019s a temptation to go in all guns blazing, but what would that really achieve?\n\nI texted Jones before he arrives: \u201cWould you like a coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cLong black, mate.\u201d\n\nWithin moments, he arrives, offering a limp handshake.\n\n\u201cHey Tom. How are you going mate? Did you bring your swimmers?\u201d he asks.\n\nHe\u2019s casually dressed in a grey, long-sleeve top, track pants and blue joggers, with an Omega watch and brown reading glasses hanging from his collar.\n\nWe make our way to a large wooden table in a quiet corner of Wylie\u2019s, along with Herald photographer Dominic Lorrimer.\n\nHerald reporter Tom Decent sits down with Eddie Jones. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nWe have decided not to record the interview on camera.\n\nJones normally loves the cameras. He has publicly eviscerated countless reporters, including myself, at press conferences over the years. He toys with journalists like a shark and its prey.\n\nAn interview Jones did with The Times rugby reporter Owen Slot has always stuck with me. Having agreed to meet Slot, a fierce critic of his coaching methods, at a Parisian bar in May last year, Jones finished the interview by telling Slot: \u201cI find you very negative. You\u2019re a spiteful person. I feel sad for you.\u201d\n\nI am not here for a headline. Jones gave enough of those during his whirlwind nine months as Wallabies coach - the second time around - to last a career.\n\nThis is about understanding the man behind the facade and why he didn\u2019t just admit to the Australian rugby public that his heart was set on returning to Japan, who he had previously coached between 2012 and 2015.\n\nI am hoping Jones will open up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested that you\u2019ve agreed to chat,\u201d I say as I hit record on my phone.\n\n\u201cMate, you\u2019re just doing your job,\u201d Jones says. \u201cSo I\u2019m happy to chat mate. Let\u2019s see how we go.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones at Wylie\u2019s Baths. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nIt\u2019s a positive \u2013 and unexpected \u2013 start.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like being back here in a place that means so much to you?\u201d an easy question to start things off.\n\nJones\u2019 eyes dart over my left shoulder to the beach, which is getting busier by the minute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to come home,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling this is where you were raised, and a lot of the values and behaviours you have come from what happened in this area.\n\n\u201cIt changes so much, though. You\u2019re walking down Coogee now and it\u2019s completely different to what it was. It\u2019s hard to find people that are from Coogee. The great thing about Australia is the beauty of nature and you see that here with the beautiful Wylie\u2019s Baths.\u201d\n\nWe will get onto the Zoom interview, but timing is everything with Jones.\n\nHe is as punctual as they come. He has already made it clear he has to leave at 9.45am sharp for a 10am meeting.\n\nWhat are Jones\u2019 fondest memories of the area, as a kid growing up down the road in La Perouse?\n\n\u201cEither playing cricket or rugby for Randwick on Coogee Oval,\u201d Jones says. \u201c[Former Wallaby] Glen Ella was at the game on Saturday. I remember one day we were warming up for a cricket game and [former Randwick coach] Jeff Sayle said, \u2018Where else would you want to be today? Sun shining on your back and you\u2019re playing for Randwick\u2019. Those memories never leave you.\u201d\n\nSayle died when Jones was coaching England at the 2019 World Cup in Japan.\n\nHe told me at the time, via text message, he wanted to fly back to Australia to be at Sayle\u2019s funeral.\n\nIn 2022, Eddie Jones was presented with his old Randwick jersey, found at the home of the late Jeffrey Sayle.\n\nUltimately, it proved to be too hard, but Jones began a press conference the next day by paying tribute to one of his greatest coaching influences.\n\nIt was the first time I\u2019d seen Jones get emotional. The only other time was when Jones was unveiled as Wallabies coach in early 2023 at his former school, Matraville High.\n\nIt is why Jones, who first became an international coach when he took over the Wallabies in 2001, says he has unfinished business at Randwick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019m 65 now. I\u2019ve made a life out of coaching, and it all came from what I experienced at Randwick. At some stage, I want to come and give back to Randwick.\u201d\n\n\u2018That was a bit of theatre, mate\u2019\n\nThis is Jones\u2019 first visit back to Australia since his last Wallabies stint ended in disaster.\n\nJones has also been busy observing his former England assistants Anthony Siebold (Manly Sea Eagles) and Jason Ryles (Parramatta Eels) as they coach in the NRL.\n\nHe was spotted in both coaches\u2019 boxes at NRL games, which did not go down well with some.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked, ropeable, flabbergasted, disappointed, dismayed and taken aback by the sight of a traitor in the Manly box,\u201d said Eddy Simpson, one half of the hugely popular Hello Sport Podcast.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, Eddie Jones is and remains a traitor given what he did to the nation.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones was announced as Japan\u2019s new head coach in December 2023. Jones repeatedly said he was not interested in the role. Credit: Viola Kam\n\nSimpson would not be alone in his view.\n\nDoes Jones care about his reputation, or think Wallabies fans will get stuck into him?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t really care mate,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re entitled to have their opinion. If they want to do that, fair enough. If they don\u2019t want to do that, good as gold.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Jones has been accused of being a turncoat. In 2022, when Jones was coaching England against the Wallabies in a game at the SCG, an Australian fan labelled him a traitor. A furious Jones had to be held back by security guards as he confronted the fan.\n\n\u201cThat was a bit of theatre, mate,\u201d Jones says as he leans in. \u201cI gave it back. You\u2019re always looking for ways to create better situations for your team. For an English team with an Australian coach, to make a deal of that just reinforces the bond between you and the team.\n\n\u201cHe was out of order. But I could have walked past. That happens a lot.\u201d\n\nIs Jones expecting more of the same from Wallabies fans when Australia hosts the Rugby World Cup in 2027? Does he have a message for any fans wanting to heckle him?\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that I came back with the best intentions,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a plan of what we needed to do. Rugby Australia agreed on the plan.\n\n\u201cMy intention was to go back and coach at [Japanese club side] Suntory [after being sacked by England]. Then Australia presented this case to me. I was very, very strong about the fact that I was only going to come back and make big changes. Australian rugby needs a revolution. I still believe that to get back to one or two or three in the world ...\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve heard this spiel before.\n\nEddie Jones at his press conference after Australia\u2019s 40-6 loss to Wales. Credit: Getty\n\nOur photographer is ready for some portraits, so we pause the interview.\n\nI tell Jones I\u2019ll grab our coffees, which are now nine minutes colder.\n\nThe conversation is flowing easier than expected.\n\nJones is now down at sea level posing for some portraits as the tide comes in. The symbolism is striking, as the salt water drenches his shoes.\n\n\u201cThe salt water won\u2019t hurt,\u201d Jones says with his feet completely underwater.\n\n\u201c2023 was such a rush, mate,\u201d he says. \u201cApart from being at it all the time, I just felt I was rushing the whole time. There was a wave coming in, and I was behind the wave the whole time.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nAs I hold our photographer\u2019s light, Jones and I chat rugby league. It\u2019s the game we both grew up on.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got Lachlan Galvin,\u201d says Jones of the Eels\u2019 bid to swoop on the teenage five-eighth when he leaves the Wests Tigers.\n\nAs we walk to another area, I\u2019ve somehow ended up with Jones\u2019 blue Canterbury hat in my hand. It\u2019s very different to the Akubra he wore while berating me and others at Sydney Airport on the eve of the World Cup when we asked questions about him leaving Michael Hooper and Quade Cooper out of the squad.\n\nA few locals are now watching Jones, but this is a much quieter spot than a bustling cafe.\n\nAs Jones poses for more photos, I tell him that he\u2019s standing on the very spot where I met my now wife in December 2020.\n\n\u201cDo you live around here mate? What does your wife do for work?\u201d he asks.\n\nEddie Jones poses for a portrait in Coogee. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nHis warmth is slightly disarming. He asks about my (failed) cricket career and why I got into journalism. Not topics I expected him to care about. Maybe he doesn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019re now sitting at the same table and back on the record again. Jones picks up his lukewarm long black and takes a sip.\n\nI still want answers.\n\n\u2018I wanted to start a rugby revolution\u2019\n\n\u201cDo you feel sorry for [former Wallabies coach] Dave Rennie,\u201d I ask. \u201cHe wanted to stay on and wasn\u2019t afforded that chance after being sacked in 2022.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always feel for a coach who gets sacked,\u201d Jones says. \u201cCoaching is a great thing to do but there are times when the results don\u2019t match the amount of work you put in. I feel for Dave.\u201d\n\nWhen Jones was appointed Wallabies coach, he invited some journalists for a drink at the Captain Cook Hotel in Paddington. By the end of the session, Jones, who didn\u2019t touch any alcohol, had criticised all of us for going too easy on the Wallabies. We all agreed he mustn\u2019t have really read our stories.\n\nWhy did he do it?\n\n\u201cI just think we needed to change the standards in Australian rugby,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019m still of that opinion, mate.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at where we want to get to\u2026\u201d\n\nJones stops himself. He realises he\u2019s used the word \u2018we\u2019. In an alternate universe, Jones is still in charge of Australia, talking up the Wallabies\u2019 chances of beating the British and Irish Lions in a blockbuster series on home soil.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying \u2018we\u2019. It\u2019s not \u2018we\u2019 now,\u201d Jones says quietly.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about it walking down here. There were two things I tried to address. One: the training intensity. Two: the behaviours of the players on and off the field. I wanted to start a rugby revolution.\u201d\n\nHamish McLennan with Eddie Jones and Andy Marinos after Jones\u2019 appointment in January 2023. Credit: Getty Images\n\nYou sold a big dream to the public, I tell him.\n\n\u201cWell, I still think that is the dream,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to back yourself to do it, and so I failed. I don\u2019t feel like I shouldn\u2019t have sold the dream because that\u2019s the dream we should have in Australian rugby.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough to play down here with guys like the Ellas. There\u2019s players in Australia who can be even better than the Ellas. But we let them go to rugby league and other sports. We\u2019ve got to make sure we keep them.\n\n\u201cYou could argue [Joseph-Aukuso] Suaalii\u2019s form has been worth every cent.\u201d\n\nThen a headline arrives. Jones says he is confident Dolphins halfback Isaiya Katoa and Canberra Raiders winger Xavier Savage would be playing for the Wallabies if he was still in charge.\n\n\u201cNo one knew that we had that plan in place,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThey were both going to be off contract.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a moot point. The Wallabies lost their first four matches under Jones, but he maintains Australia should have beaten New Zealand in Dunedin after leading at half-time.\n\nEddie Jones before a 2023 Bledisloe Cup match in Dunedin. Credit: Getty\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that people are disappointed in the way it ended,\u201d Jones says. \u201cYou never like to upset people like that. Even yourself, mate. I can sit here comfortably and say I committed myself 100 per cent to make it work, and it just didn\u2019t end up in the end.\u201c\n\nIt feels like the door is being opened to broach the Japan subject. Deep breath.\n\nMy mother would say, \u2018Is what Tom is saying right\u2019?\n\nI ask Jones what his version of events are when it comes to the Zoom interview he took with JRFU officials while in camp with the Wallabies in France.\n\nJones\u2019 response is unsurprising.\n\n\u201cStill the same as I said before, mate,\u201d Jones says with a piercing gaze. \u201cWe are not going to agree on this. You\u2019ve got what you think is right.\n\n\u201cI gave them some advice on who they should pick to be the next head coach. The next discussion I had with them [Japan] was after leaving Australia.\u201d\n\nAs in telling Japan who they should select?\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\nThere is no point flogging a dead horse. The Herald stands by the story 100 per cent. We obtained screenshots that show the Zoom call Jones logged onto, with a personal email address, had a title that read: \u201cJRFU 1st Round Interviews with M15 HC Candidates.\u201d\n\nScreenshots show the JRFU\u2019s Zoom meeting room titled \u2018First round interview, Eddie Jones\u2019, and the personal email address from which Jones accepted the invitation. Credit: Illustration: Aresna Villanueva\n\nJones can\u2019t explain this.\n\nThe nature of the discussions on the call made it clear it was an interview.\n\nMeanwhile, applications for the role closed on August 18, according to a confidential candidate briefing document published at the time by this masthead.\n\nJones had claimed there was only a recruitment company on the call, but has now conceded JRFU officials were there too. The Herald knows who those officials were.\n\nFor weeks, Jones denied a call of any kind had even existed. The Herald has other proof.\n\nThe story broke on the morning of the Wales game, which Australia effectively needed to win to guarantee their place in the quarter-finals.\n\nA few days earlier, the Herald went to Rugby Australia for a comment. I would have messaged Jones directly, but my number was blocked. He\u2019d also made it clear he never wanted to hear from me again.\n\nInstead of telling us the story was wrong, Jones declined to comment. It was telling.\n\nEddie Jones at Wylie\u2019s Baths. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nI ask Jones whether the story was a distraction.\n\n\u201cI can honestly say, mate, it didn\u2019t really worry me because I was so worried about the Wales game,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI knew without [Taniela] Tupou and [Will Skelton] we were under the pump, and it was going to be a difficult game to beat Wales.\u201d\n\nDid he sense Australia were about to be thrashed 40-6 by Wales?\n\n\u201cI always thought it was going to be a difficult game.\u201d\n\nWhen Australia were knocked out of the World Cup, did Jones know then his Wallabies days were numbered?\n\n\u201cEven at that stage - and I know you\u2019ll debate this - [Wallabies general manager] Chris Webb and I were driving the fact we were going to restructure Australian rugby,\u201d Jones says. \u201cWe had the agreement of the Rugby Committee [Phil Waugh and Dan Herbert].\u201d\n\nWe agree to disagree and move on.\n\nEddie Jones ahead of Australia\u2019s Test against Wales at the World Cup. Credit: Getty\n\n\u201cDid you think my reporting at the time was unfair?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cIn essence, mate, I only heard bits and pieces,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI don\u2019t read anything. When I became England coach, I made a pact that I\u2019d never read anything any more. I only hear things.\n\n\u201cThough my mother would say, \u2018Is what Tom is saying right?\u2019 My sister would ask am I alright. You hear all these sort of things. But I never really read it.\u201d\n\n\u2018You want to be at a place where someone loves you\u2019\n\nThis is my last crack at the Japan issue.\n\nTD: But Eddie, you must have had people hammering you, asking if you were going to Japan?\n\nEJ: Post the World Cup, private equity was off and the states were starting to beat the drum. I was told when I joined that the states had agreed to this new restructuring of Australian rugby. Then by the middle of the World Cup, we\u2019re hearing that Queensland and the Brumbies are not in. It\u2019s unravelling. I went in with the intention of a five-year plan but by that meeting in Paris with the Rugby Committee, I knew it was going to be difficult. Even then, I was still committed.\n\nTD: Really?\n\nEJ: Things are starting to look a bit shaky. You met your wife down there, right?\n\nA confused look must have come across my face as Jones points down to the pool.\n\nEJ: You\u2019re both committed to each other. But if the other half\u2019s not committed \u2026 you want to be at a place where someone loves you, right? And when they\u2019re not loving you, then you\u2019re starting to think this is a bit shaky. I can\u2019t say that at a press conference mate. How can I say that? I still wanted to make it happen.\n\nEddie Jones fronts the media at Coogee Oval in October 2023. Credit: Steven Siewert\n\nTD: So you pretended like it was all OK?\n\nEJ: There\u2019s always a backstory. Sometimes you can tell that, and sometimes you can\u2019t. I could tell you stuff about players or how the team operated, but it doesn\u2019t help anyone now. I got criticised a lot for selection. I could say things about the players.\n\nTD: As in players not being up to scratch?\n\nEJ: Yep.\n\nTD: The comment about Michael Hooper and some other senior figures not being the right role models for the team spring to mind. Do you stand by that?\n\nEJ: I don\u2019t want to criticise any players. I just felt we needed a new set of standards. I don\u2019t know whether I could have got them from those boys. It\u2019s always difficult, particularly players who have been really good. In the circumstances, what could I have done better? I probably should have planned their exits better.\n\nTD: When it all ended with Australia, how were you feeling?\n\nEJ: Really disappointed. There\u2019s probably no one more Australian than me. I wanted to come back and I wanted to do a great job for Australia. I failed. So you carry the personal failure. You don\u2019t like to make fans feel terrible.\n\nThe Wallabies had a World Cup to forget in France. Credit: Getty\n\nTD: What happened next?\n\nEJ: We stayed here. I was living out of a suitcase a whole year. My wife (Hiroko) was in between England and Japan and here. We also lost our dog (Annie), which was like our daughter. Personally, it wasn\u2019t a great year behind the scenes. But again, that\u2019s no excuse.\n\nTD: After that airport press conference you texted me: \u201cDon\u2019t ever contact me again.\u201d Why did you do it? I later learned about your dog. I\u2019m sorry to hear about that.\n\nEJ: I probably didn\u2019t recognise it at the time, but it [the dog passing away] probably had an effect on me. You try to put those things away, mate. I\u2019m not making this as an excuse at all, but yeah, that disruption to the family probably did affect me in some way.\n\nTD: Were you aware that if you ended up as Japan\u2019s head coach you\u2019d look like you were being loose with the truth?\n\nEJ: Yeah. You can\u2019t help that.\n\nTD: Your presentation in your final interview in Tokyo must have been excellent. (Jones maintains this was his only interview with the JRFU, six days before he was announced as Japan\u2019s head coach. However, applications for the role had closed 110 days earlier).\n\nEJ: [Pauses]. I don\u2019t know. Obviously, I got the job. The funny thing was post Australia I\u2019m thinking, \u2018shit, this is not good\u2019, right? I wanted to prove I can coach. You\u2019re only as good as your last game.\n\nHerald reporter Tom Decent at a press conference in Tokyo where Eddie Jones was unveiled as Japan\u2019s rugby coach. Credit: Viola Kam\n\nTD: How have you found the Japan job? Last year they had a review into the program and your position. (Japan won just four of 11 Tests in 2024, with those victories coming against Canada, USA, Samoa and Uruguay).\n\nEJ: They haven\u2019t beaten a top 10 country since 2019, but there is a perception they are doing well. It\u2019s just going to be hard work. I think we\u2019ll have one more year of pain, and then I reckon we\u2019ll be in a position where we can compete for longer periods. By 2027, I\u2019ve got no doubt we can have a team that can win [matches] at the World Cup.\n\nTD: Some of the criticism must have hurt. What about [Wallabies great] Phil Kearns effectively saying you were a liar and had deceived the Australian rugby public?\n\nEJ: I never worry about what people say, unless they say it to your face. I can be criticised for a lot of things, mate. If I criticise myself, the biggest criticism I have for myself was that I thought I could do it quickly. Maybe I got a bit carried away. I couldn\u2019t make the dream a reality. Most good things don\u2019t happen quickly, but I probably thought I could do it, which was an overestimation of my ability.\n\nEddie Jones. Credit: Illustration: Stephen Kiprillis\n\n\u2018I probably did treat you unprofessionally\u2019\n\nTime has crept up on us both. I have some two-up to play, while Jones has that 10am meeting before he heads to the Roosters-Dragons match at Allianz Stadium.\n\nAny regrets, Eddie?\n\n\u201cI do regret the airport press conference. I lost control there. You never want to lose control.\u201d\n\nAs I lean in to grab my phone, I tell Jones that I appreciate him giving up his time.\n\n\u201cI apologise, mate. Serious,\u201d he says before a short pause. This is the sincerest I\u2019ve ever seen Jones.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t try to piss you off mate, but you know, I probably did treat you unprofessionally, so I apologise mate.\u201d\n\nJones thanks me for the coffee, offers a slightly firmer handshake, before leaving Wylie\u2019s.\n\nEddie Jones after a 45-minute interview with the Herald. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nJones doesn\u2019t know it, but he outfoxed me twice during the end of 2023.\n\nWe got a tip that Jones was flying from Sydney to Tokyo once he\u2019d quit as Wallabies coach. I spent three hours circling the international terminal on a Saturday night, only to later learn he had caught a morning flight instead.\n\nA few weeks later, I found out the Tokyo hotel where Jones was going to have his second interview with the JRFU.\n\nThe Herald had a photographer waiting, but he never caught a glimpse of him arriving. We had the story but no killer photo.\n\nAs I walk away, I spot Jones waiting for a taxi. He\u2019s about a pitching wedge away from his old mate Poidevin\u2019s place.\n\n\u201cYou heading to Poido\u2019s house?\u201d\n\nJones laughs as we part ways.\n\nA few minutes later, my phone pings. It\u2019s a text from Jones. Drama?\n\n\u201cThanks for coffee,\u201d he writes. He\u2019d already said thank you.\n\nLoading\n\nI reply: \u201cNo prob. Really appreciate you doing that. Think it was good for both of us. Wish you all the best mate. Enjoy the league.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, probably right mate!\u201d Jones writes. \u201cI really don\u2019t like bad blood, so you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nThe next time we see each other could be in October when the Wallabies face Japan in Tokyo.\n\nExpect fireworks. Just maybe not between us.\n\nWatch all the action from the 2025 Super Rugby Pacific season on Stan Sport, the only place to watch every match, live and on demand.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Unlike Pinocchio, the real-life Tiger Woods and tennis\u2019s Williams sisters, Craig Fitzgibbon was not turned on the lathe of his father\u2019s ambition. Fitzgibbon, the 47-year-old coach of the Sharks since 2022, is a premiership player, as is his father Allan, who also coached Cronulla between 1988-91. Despite their football club backgrounds being almost as parallel as the uprights through which Craig kicked goals to become the highest points-scoring forward in premiership history, Allan never sought to shape his son\u2019s career or reap its rewards. (After all, any generational family coaching Sydney\u2019s poorest club, such as the earlier example of John and Aaron Raper, knows you don\u2019t coach the Sharks for money). Craig Fitzgibbon with his father Allan and mother Michelle in 2003. Credit: Greg Totman Allan says, \u201cCraig was a ballboy with me at Cronulla, but once he started getting into junior rep teams, I stepped aside.\u201d Craig agrees, saying, \u201cMy father let me make my own decisions. He gave advice, but he always left it to me to make the end call. \u201cMum and dad still live in Dapto,\u201d he adds with the unassuming normalcy both families live their lives. \u201cHe goes to the odd game, but doesn\u2019t come to Shark Park home games,\u201d before adding in joking reference to Allan\u2019s role, as a centre, in one of rugby league\u2019s greatest upsets - Balmain beating Souths in the 1969 grand final - \u201cHe goes to about 15 Balmain 1969 reunions a year.\u201d Allan Fitzgibbon playing for Balmain. Credit: Fairfax Media\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig is as closed as an oyster about his own life and is resistant to publicity. He opens up only about his childhood years, saying, \u201cI do remember the joy of coming to the game. I\u2019ve been in and around first-grade dressing sheds since the age of 7. I didn\u2019t realise how fortunate I\u2019ve been until I started bringing my own kids to the football. They love it.\u201d He agrees the pull of the game is akin to a great ocean tide; it churns on relentlessly, with its hold over you greater beneath the surface than above. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around the game most of our lives. I don\u2019t know if we know anything different.\u201d Surely, it is to rugby league\u2019s credit that so many play/coach their father\u2019s game with their father\u2019s name. Craig Fitzgibbon actually took the point-scoring record from Canberra\u2019s David Furner who later coached the club, as did his father, Don. \u2018He goes to about 15 Balmain 1969 reunions a year.\u2019 Craig Fitzgibbon\u2019s cheeky description of his famous father Allan Other NRL combinations are the Clearys at Penrith; the Flanagans at the Dragons, the Fultons at Manly and the Arthurs at Parramatta. The NRLW has Steph Hancock, daughter of early Queensland Origin player, Rohan, as well as Millie Boyle (now Elliott), daughter of Raider, David. The Bulldogs Max King is a fourth-generation player, with father David (Titans), grandfather John (St George) and great-grandfather Cec (South Sydney). The Fitzgibbons are about to become a three-generational rugby league family with Craig\u2019s son Aaymon - a promising five-eighth with the Illawarra Steelers SG Ball team - in demand from a number of NRL clubs. Consistent with Allan\u2019s \u201cadvice only\u201d involvement in Craig\u2019s career, Craig will ensure the Fitzgibbon name will neither be a burden nor a blessing. \u201cAaymon has just starting to talk to a number of clubs,\u201d he said, hinting his son will not be at Cronulla. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to his manager, Dave Riolo. He did eight weeks pre-season training with St George Illawarra before going back to SG Ball. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s best at his age to jump to another club.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig Fitzgibbon playing for the Dragons in 1999. Credit: NRL Imagery While the father of Wests Tigers Lachlan Galvin might take a different view on the future of his 19-year-old son, longstanding St George Illawarra supporters will be heartened by Craig\u2019s preference that his son remains a Dragon. After all, Craig left the club the year after starring in the losing 1999 grand final team. He won\u2019t talk about it, but his ex-teammates still do, sad they lost a player who, had he started the game and St George Illawarra won, would probably have been awarded the Churchill Medal for best on ground. It is a tale of lost opportunity, fuelled by the administrative inertia of the early years of the joint venture. Fitzgibbon waited for days for a contract before the Sydney Roosters made him feel wanted, saying: \u201cHere\u2019s a three-year deal; good money; we want you to play for us and be our goal kicker.\u201d As it transpired, Fitzgibbon won his Churchill Medal in the Roosters\u2019 2002 premiership team. Yet, it is the only grand final he won in five attempts, also losing in 2000, 2003 and 2004. His critics as a coach point to his results with the Sharks, finishing second in 2022 but losing successive finals; sixth in 2023 but fourth in 2024 before a loss to the Storm, a win over the Cowboys, followed by a 26-6 loss to the premiers. Allan, similarly, won the Sharks\u2019 inaugural minor premiership in 1988 followed by successive losses in the finals, while the 1989 and 1990 years were also disappointing. But to blame these results on Fitzgibbon genes is ludicrous. An earlier Cronulla coach, Jack Gibson, was mystified by the Sharks\u2019 finals paralysis. Apart from his quip about waiting for the Sharks to win a premiership being akin to leaving the porch light on for Harold Holt, the ARL Coach of the Century also lamented of Cronulla: \u201cThere is something in the woodwork of the joint.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig Fitzgibbon hugs Sydney Roosters captain Brad Fittler after they won the 2002 title Credit: REUTERS But if rich clubs think the most important factor in winning is spirit, poor clubs know it is money. Another Cronulla coach, John Lang, highlighted this when he said, before Shane Flanagan\u2019s 2016 breakthrough premiership: \u201cPeople ridicule the Sharks for not winning a premiership. It\u2019s a success for the club just to survive a season.\u201d The financial situation at Shark Park is better now, with the NRL funding the salary cap, as well as a $5m administrative grant. Allan Fitzgibbon agrees, saying, \u201cThey\u2019ve had some dramas over the years, but from what I hear, things are pretty stable now.\u201d However, clubs like the Broncos, Panthers and Bulldogs, have resources to provide benefits the Sharks can only envy. Still, it\u2019s a mental barrier, rather than a monetary one the Sharks must break through in 2025 if their end of season is not to resemble a vain man\u2019s 39th birthday - an annual event. Fitzgibbon\u2019s No.7, Nicho Hynes, must learn to take control of games. Asked whether his own future is inextricably linked to the performance in big games of Hynes and to a lesser extent, No.6 Braydon Trindall, Fitzgibbon says, \u201cyep\u201d, before launching into a spirited, off-the-record, defence of them. Nicho Hynes and Craig Fitzgibbon. Credit: NRL Photos After winning the 2022 Dally M medal, Hynes faced helium-filled expectations, but then came two poor State of Origin matches. He\u2019d developed a reputation for either magic or meltdown. At times on the field, Nicho looks like a bank robber surrounded by cops, but lately, with the Sharks 4-4, he usually resembles a traffic cop comfortably in control. Fitzgibbon refuses to elaborate, except to say all top halves have early \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d and it takes time to develop an all-around game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRL\u2019s best player, Penrith\u2019s Nathan Cleary, is yet to dominate Origin. Melbourne\u2019s Jahrome Hughes took six years to progress from a utility who did not play a game on New Zealand\u2019s tour of England to winning the 2024 Dally M Medal for being the game\u2019s best player. \u2018When you tell a player a lie, you shoot yourself in the foot. They will come in droves for you after that.\u2019 Allan Fitzgibbon Cronulla is white-bread territory, suggesting it would embrace the tribal nature of Anglo-Saxon families, despite its insularity. However, the Sharks season launch featured on stage Indigenous Australian, Maori, Samoan and Tongan dance routines from players across the NRL and NRLW, including pathway teams. A cultural banner, incorporating 46 different heritages was unveiled. Fitzgibbon defers all credit to the club\u2019s welfare department for celebrating the increasing diversity in the game. Loading Fitzgibbon is a fundamentally decent man in a profession which breeds paranoia and surliness. His friends say there are only a small number of better people in the world, such as a few mothers and the recently departed Pope. His critics wonder if he lacks the ruthlessness sometimes needed. Yet, above all, players demand honesty, although increasingly, it would seem to be criticism followed by a cuddle.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size To most, they\u2019re pancakes \u2013 but to Torrey Peters, they\u2019re monkey blankets. Eggs are cackleberries, chewing tobacco is Scandihoovian dynamite, and women are skooches and strumpets. Peters immersed herself so deeply in woodcutter slang while writing her remarkable new novella Stag Dance, set in a 19th-century illegal logging camp, that after a day of writing, she\u2019d amuse (and/or annoy) her family and friends by slipping into her lumberjack voice. And she doesn\u2019t just talk the talk. Peters can walk the walk, or in this case, fell the trees. The story was inspired by the time she spent living in her off-grid, 12-by-12, log cabin in rugged Vermont, in the New England region. There\u2019s no running water, just a stream for bathing. There\u2019s an outdoor kitchen and outhouse; a wood stove heats a sauna. Novelist Torrey Peters. Credit: Leonardo Cendamo \u201cI was learning to use a chainsaw because I had to cut the trees for firewood and build a bridge on the logs. Nothing super impressive, but I had to be like This is a spruce, this is a balsam fir. We have beech and maple. I learnt all the different trees and what they do,\u201d Peters says, now safely ensconced in her Brooklyn apartment, flashing mint green nails as she talks. \u201cIt\u2019s a real 1880s lifestyle out there, which means that I\u2019ll go there for a week at a time, but I think some part of my mind would break if I were there super long.\u201d As she worked, Peters wondered about the people who lived such hard and isolated lives, and the experience of the self while alone in the woods, with only the trees to affirm, challenge or question you. \u201cI\u2019m from the Midwest, and I was raised a boy. If you told my 17-year-old self that when you turn 40, you\u2019re going to be in the woods with a chainsaw struggling to build something but feeling grimly pleased with your proficiency, I would have been like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019,\u201d Peters says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never would have thought I\u2019d have transitioned, but I would have been like, that\u2019s a masculine model of being. Well, what does it mean that I did transition and I ended up exactly where my 17-year-old self expected?\u201d She had no answer, but those questions laid the first axe-blow for a novel set in a logging camp. During her research, Peters discovered a historical tradition in American frontier camps where dances were held, and some loggers would attend as women. To signify their role, they would attach an inverted brown triangle of fabric over their crotch \u2013 a practice that becomes a central motif in Stag Dance. Vermont, in the United States, where Torrey Peters owns a tiny cabin. The story follows Babe Bunyan, a large, rugged lumberjack who decides to attend the camp\u2019s stag dance as a woman, placing him in a rivalry with the younger, more feminine Lisen. Set against the grit and grime of an illegal logging camp, the story evokes the poetic sensibilities of authors like Cormac McCarthy and Herman Melville. Loading The lumberjack vernacular \u2014 for which Peters drew on a dictionary of logger slang \u2014 allowed her to approach questions of trans identity through the \u201cside door\u201d. Phrases like gender dysphoria, she says, have had the life sucked out of them through academic, medical, and online discourse. A lumberjack, however, would never have used that phrase in the first place. This forced Peters to think, and write, about how gender dysphoria feels rather than relying on familiar terms. For Babe, it\u2019s summed up in the description: \u201cNo mirror has ever befriended me.\u201d \u201cI had to reinvent a lot of the trans language that, to me, feels ossified,\u201d Peters says. \u201cIt ended up being quite magical for me that I had this new language to find out these things. They became defamilarised and new for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStag Dance gives its name to Peter\u2019s new collection of four stories, each of which deliciously twists familiar genres into unexpected shapes; full of surprises without sacrificing any emotional intensity. The collection also includes Infect Your Friends and Loved Ones, a post-apocalyptic tale where a pandemic renders humans unable to produce sex hormones; the boarding school romance The Chaser; and The Masker, a body horror story set at a cross-dressing convention. Only a few characters are explicitly trans, with Peters more interested in breaking down the binary between trans and cis people, revealing the categories as porous and complex. Peters says the gap between how a person feels in themselves or wants to be seen, and how the world sees them, isn\u2019t an experience unique to trans people. \u201cFor me, coming at it with emotions was the point. Coming at it without identity, without heuristics, or this is how we break it down, is how I am interested in writing these days,\u201d Peters says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I am demanding empathy for trans people. It\u2019s actually more than I\u2019m demanding that readers have empathy for themselves, and I think in having empathy for themselves \u2013 \u201cOh yes, I\u2019ve felt that way before\u201d \u2013 they can maybe then start to make maps of what other people are doing, they can make intellectual maps based on those emotions.\u201d Torrey Peters\u2019 new collection is Stag Dance. Stag Dance is the final story in Torrey Peters\u2019 collection and the only one written after her debut novel, Detransition, Baby, became a bestseller in 2021. That novel \u2013 a comedy of manners about a trio who plan to raise a baby together \u2013 was described by one critic as \u201cthe first great trans realist novel.\u201d Its longlisting for the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction made Peters the first openly trans woman nominated for the award. However, the nomination drew scrutiny, including an open letter condemning Torrey\u2019s eligibility by a group called the Wild Woman Writing Club. Peters wrote at the time that she had received an \u201coutpouring of hate\u201d and expressed hope that the next trans woman to be on the list could at least enjoy the experience more. Peters knows some readers will be disappointed she didn\u2019t write another \u201ctrans Sex in the City\u201d in the style of Detransition, Baby \u2013 and she started work on a financial thriller set in contemporary Brooklyn. But the weight of the expectation felt restrictive, she found liberation a world away from the contemporary in the minds and language of lumberjacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just unexpected for other people. It\u2019s very unexpected for myself. But I think that\u2019s like a really good place to write from, when you\u2019re surprising yourself,\u201d Peters says. \u201cNobody was waiting for this. Nobody was like, \u2018What we want is a lumberjack novel.\u2019 In a lot of ways, that freed me to do whatever I wanted. \u201d Trans people have increasingly found themselves at the centre of public debate and policymaking in the United States with the Trump administration targeting trans people with executive orders. Loading These include an order that the United States will recognise only a person\u2019s sex assigned at birth, and new restrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts, targeting efforts to promote diversity and so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d. In a recent essay for New York Magazine, Peters described how under the Trump administration, her passport would be changed from \u201cF\u201d to \u201cM\u201d and the consequences that would have when she travelled to Colombia, where she owns an apartment. These policies, Peters says, are designed to intimidate and silence. Initially, she felt overwhelmed by the hostility, but over time, she has become more resolute. \u201cI\u2019m meant to be scared. I\u2019m meant to say home. I am meant not to go anywhere, and the M is meant to stop me from doing that sort of stuff,\u201d Peters says.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "If you are living in an area that has become a corflute battleground, with images of local candidates of various colours on every second corner, then it's likely you are living in a marginal seat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese seats are often the target of political activity because changing the minds of just a few hundred or thousand residents could swing the results in favour of the opposite party.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in Bennelong in Sydney's north-west, just 1,954 votes in the two-candidate preferred count resulted in Labor claiming victory in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to a redistribution, Shaun Ratcliff, a political scientist from research firm Accent Research, said the seat is now notionally Liberal \u2014 on a 0.04 per cent margin \u2014 which will make it a challenge for Labor to retain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Certainly the seat could go either way,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's not just the slim margin that makes the electorate interesting.\n\n\n\nRatcliff also points to Bennelong's diverse population. It includes reasonably affluent areas such as Hunters Hill \u2014 the waterfront suburb actor Cate Blanchett once called home \u2014 but also many students who attend the local Macquarie University.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the electorate has a large multicultural population, with around one in five voters reporting Chinese ancestry.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimon Welsh, director of research and reputation at pollster Redbridge Group, said if Labor retains Bennelong \u2014 along with other marginal Sydney seats such as Reid and even Parramatta \u2014 it will be because of younger, more educated and diverse voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelsh will also be watching Melbourne seats like Menzies and Deakin, where a similar demographic may result in votes shifting from Liberal to Labor.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The face of Australia is changing \u2014 and so are voter loyalties\n\nWelsh said other seats to watch where Labor's vote could be in trouble are those in more economically stressed areas of Victoria, such as Hawke, Gorton and McEwen.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Hawke and Gorton are safe Labor seats, but the retirement of Brendan O'Connor in Gorton, combined with rising cost of living pressures, may bring these factors into play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Regional NSW also looks like it could be a problem for Labor, including seats such as Hunter and down the coast to Gilmore,\" Welsh said.\n\n\n\nWhat is a marginal seat?\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission categorises marginal seats as electorates held with a margin of less than 6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether your seat is considered marginal by searching for your electorate or entering your address in the interactive map below.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut experts generally identify specific key seats using analysis of polling and other factors.\n\n\n\nKey seats to watch on election night\n\nRedbridge has identified 20 key seats that could prove to be interesting contests between Labor and the Coalition, as well as other seats where independents and Greens candidates will be strong contenders.\n\n\n\nKey contests between Labor and the Coalition that experts will be watching on election night. Source: SBS News Other seats where independents or Greens could be elected include:\n\n\n\nCoalition facing off against independents in Kooyong, Goldstein, Curtin, Mackellar, Calare, Cowper, Monash and Wannon.\n\nLabor is facing an independent in Fowler.\n\nLabor is facing a Greens candidate in Wills.\n\nThree-cornered contest between Labor, Coalition and the Greens in Brisbane, Ryan and Macnamara.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

Who do you trust to manage the economy? Who do you trust to keep our country safe in uncertain times?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBANDT: \"A once in a generation chance, by voting Greens, to keep Peter Dutton out and get Labor to act.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe election was called on the 28th of March.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the following day, both major party leaders were in Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the next five weeks, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton travelled to every state, and both leaders visited the Northern Territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister made it to the A-C-T, the Opposition Leader did not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition's pitch: to get Australia back on track.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs living standards fall across the country, with high inflation and stagnant growth plaguing the economy, Peter Dutton has promised better economic management, and cutting waste.... including in the public service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will reverse Labor\u2019s increase of 41,000 Canberra public servants, because it will save about $7 billion a year .\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe initial plan was also to force public servants back into the office - but that was later abandoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've apologised for the decision that we took in relation to work from home. It only applied to Canberra. Labor's run this scare campaign and I think we bring an end to that today and we strongly support flexible workplace arrangements.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCutting the fuel excise in half for 12 months is the basis of the Coalition's cost of living relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition leader notched up more than a dozen trips to service stations across the country during the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tax is worth about 50c per litre on fuel, with the proposal to come into effect from July 1st this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's 25 cents. That's 50 cents. Let's keep going. 25 cents every litre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's something that has the greatest benefits in the outer suburbs, which is where the Coalition believes it can win the most seats.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther cost of living relief includes a one-off low- and middle-income tax offset worth up to $1,200 to be delivered at the end of the next financial year, and cuts to migration, which the Coalition says will help reduce financial pressure on households.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton has also vowed to bring down energy prices by adding nuclear to the grid in the long term, and a gas reservation plan in the short term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With our gas plan, we'll bring down the price of gas by 15 per cent. Gas is a key ingredient in the production of electricity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foundation of Labor's campaign has been Medicare ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake. We know one of the big distinctions in Australian politics is Labor, which created Medicare and will strengthen Medicare.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n... with visits to hospitals across the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior party figures, including Treasurer Jim Chalmers, have been repeatedly claiming that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Peter Dutton will come after Medicare like he did last time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor is promising around $9 billion towards Medicare for additional incentives for doctors to bulk bill more patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party is also promising to open more Urgent Care Clinics, establish a '1800MEDICARE\u2019 service for free after-hours telehealth consultations, cap the cost of PBS prescriptions to $25, and to expand access to free mental health services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has tried to take the sting out of the healthcare blitz, matching the $9 billion for Medicare, the $25 prescription promise, and announcing its own plan to double the number of Medicare subsidised psychologist vista a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor's campaign slogan of...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Building Australia's Future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n... tries to evoke a sense of ambition that many feel has been lacking from Anthony Albanese's prime ministership so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt promises cost-of-living relief in the short term through a tax cut that's already passed parliament - that the Coalition says it will axe - and promised energy bill relief for the rest of the year, as well as a $1000 instant deduction on future tax returns.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the longer term, there's a focus on housing with a plan to allow all first home buyers to purchase a place with a 5 per cent deposit, and funding to help reach the target of 1.2 million new homes built within five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor's also guaranteeing access to affordable childcare three days a week, getting rid of the activity test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A core part of that future is preparing for the generations to come by getting childcare right, by getting schooling right, and of course by giving the best options for the beginning of life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition also has a plan for housing, allowing people to access super for a house deposit and claim some of the interest of their first home mortgage against tax for five years when buying a new home.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the Greens have been clear - if a minority government is to happen, they won't support Peter Dutton.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, they want to force Labor to do more on issues like housing and healthcare.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Adam Bandt is putting forward a plan to get rid of negative gearing, except for people with just one investment property, and scrap the capital gains tax concession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a huge numbers of people who are using this scheme to look after their retirement, people who have made plans for their future based on the levers available to them. These people aren\u2019t billionaires or wealthy property investors, it\u2019s not their fault the system is so broken and they make up more than two thirds of people who use negative gearing. We will protect these existing Mum and Dad investors by grandfathering negative gearing and capital gains tax for people with one investment property. That remains for them forever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're also pushing for dental to be added into Medicare.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese has consistently ruled out working with the minor party, who went from one seat to four seats at the last election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three seats in South-East Queensland are all in play this election.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the start of the election, former Labor Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan had this to say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a myriad of challenges. There's been no no government in the last couple of years that's been re-elected internationally in this cost of living crisis, which is largely internationally induced. So it's, it's a tough environment to go to the people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that was true - across Europe in 2024, incumbent governments had largely been voted out, including in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States it was the same, with a change in government through the election of Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the election campaign, people were anticipating a similar response in Australia with people upset about falling living conditions turning to a conservative government for change.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Trump effect has played out differently than expected as seen in the Canadian election this week, with Mark Carney's Liberal Party holding on to power.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's tariffs have wreaked havoc on global markets, with widespread global concerns about the way the administration has acted in its first 100 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has navigated the storm on the global stage, whilst leaning into the comparison between Peter Dutton and Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He implements his policies directly from the United States. He wants the Americanisation of health, public service and education.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton has tried to position himself as the person who can stand up for Australia, saying Anthony Albanese isn't doing enough on tariffs, or national security, as Chinese military vessels spent time in international waters around Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's pitching that a Coalition government would keep Australia safe, promising an increase to the defence budget to 3 per cent of G-D-P within a decade, if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will be an important expenditure, because we need to keep our country safe, and if we're to preserve peace and stability in our region, if we're to be a good ally with our partners, then Australia needs to invest in defence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the leaders' diplomatic reflexes were tested after a report claiming that Russia had asked Indonesia to base long-range aircraft at an air force base off the Indonesian province of Papua was published.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton was quick to call the Prime Minister out, saying it was a failure of the government that it was not informed about this before the information was made public, and telling the ABC...\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"There's commentary that I have seen reported from the Indonesian spokesperson. And that's obviously come from the administration. There are reports of negotiations or discussions that have taken place between Russia and Indonesia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"My question is where have you seen the Indonesian president confirm this? Aren't you verballing the Indonesian President?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"There's comment that's come out of the administration, out of the Prabowo administration.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there was no public comment from the Indonesian President, as pointed out by Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mr Dutton saw a headline, and he didn't wait for the facts. He didn't wait for the facts. That's not the sort of man you want to be the Prime Minister of the country. He's simply, as I said this morning, too aggro (aggressive) and too reckless.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has also struggled with lack of detail throughout the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were few policies announced ahead of March 28th, with a plan to make the election pitch during the five-week period.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst announcements have slowly been made, there has been criticism that they have lacked detail - as on overseas migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Coalition has said it would reduce net overseas migration by 100,000 people a year, it hasn't exactly said how.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's promising that details on migration will come if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We said that we'll take advice from the Department of Treasury and finance and central agencies about the settings within the economy and what we need to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's making the same promise about where 41,000 public service jobs will be cut.\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"We will look across government, in Canberra, to to identify where the additional places are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJOURNO: \"Is it fair that out of a public service of 200,000 people you're not gonna say which 41,000 of them might not have a job in six weeks?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"I just think you want to get back to reality, and reality is here in the suburbs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Labor, Anthony Albanese has failed to garner the trust of some Australians - a feeling captured in comments made about falling off the stage at an event early in the campaign - and then later denying that he fell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"REPORTER: \"The worst moment of this campaign so far?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"Oh, probably falling off the stage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"You said this morning at the breakfast event that falling off the stage had been the worst moment of the campaign for you, when you were in the Hunter Valley.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"It was a joke. It was a joke. Chill out. Next.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"But at the time you said you hadn't fallen off the stage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"Well, I didn't fall. I did not - \"\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \".. you would like to clarify...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it stands, heading into the election, the Labor Party will lose its majority if it loses just two seats, whilst the Coalition needs to win 23 seats to get a majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere could be some movement on the record-sized crossbench - with three Greens seats at risk, one independent retiring and a couple of Teal seats up in the air, and new community independents in the contest across the country.\n\n\n\n",

So I'm up for legislation that has broad support, but we do not need further issues created.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the signing of a minerals deal with the United States was a result of negotiation that has led to what he calls a truly equal agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter months of tense negotiations, the U-S and Ukraine signed a deal that is expected to give Washington access to the country\u2019s critical minerals and other natural resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nKyiv hopes to secure long-term support for its defence against Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Zelenskyy says the agreement is now a fair one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The agreement has changed significantly. Now it is truly an equal agreement that creates an opportunity for investments in Ukraine. The agreement does not create debt. It establishes a recovery fund, which will invest in Ukraine and generate profits here. It's a joint effort with America built on fair terms.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agreement \u2014 which the Ukrainian parliament must ratify \u2014 would establish a reconstruction fund for Ukraine that Ukrainian officials hope will ensure future American military assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump has replaced his national security adviser Mike Waltz, naming Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting adviser and nominating Mr Waltz for UN ambassador.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Waltz and his deputy Alex Wong resigned following revelations Mr Waltz had added a journalist to a Signal group where officials discussed sensitive military plans, including precise airstrike timings shared by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Waltz claimed he didn\u2019t know how the journalist got in.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Hegseth is now under Pentagon investigation for bypassing security protocols and using an unsecured computer near classified terminals, fuelling concerns over information security.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite bipartisan criticism, Mr Trump continues to back Mr Hegseth as pressure mounts on the administration\u2019s national security leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer US Vice President Kamala Harris has described Donald Trump's actions over the past 100 days as a high velocity event that has been decades in the making.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defeated Democratic presidential candidate has told supporters the last three months were part of a plan by conservatives to change the face of government in America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"An agenda to slash public education. An agenda to shrink government and then privatise its services. All while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Harris' speech to the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America has come the day after Mr Trump reached 100 days in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials have confirmed there is currently a shortage of some medications used to treat ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Therapeutic Goods Administration has identified several brands as being impacted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regulator has approved a supply of overseas-registered Concerta tablets to reduce the impact of shortages.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it says the shortage could last until the end of the year, forcing more than a million Australians to pay more for substitutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn basketball, Australian Dyson Daniels has won this season's Most Improved Player award in the NBA in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe award is voted on by 100 basketball writers and broadcasters from around the world.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "This article contains references to suicide/self-harm.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayden Delbridge lost his father to suicide at the age of eight.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 14, he became a mental health advocate.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow 20, he is the founder of UrVoice Australia, a not-for-profit that provides mental health and wellbeing support to school students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Conversation about] mental health doesn\u2019t start in the hospital. It starts in cafes; it starts in speaking with friends in informal settings,\" Delbridge said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report based on two online polls covering nearly 1,400 respondents in various age groups (gen Z, millennials, 18+) by the Social Health Foundation highlights how loneliness, social isolation and disconnection are fuelling a mental health crisis amongst Australia's youth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also shines a light on the \"hidden first responders\" to mental health problems.\n\n\n\nSocial connection in Australia breaking down\n\nThe report highlights areas where social connection is breaking down amongst Australia's gen Z and millennials.\n\n\n\n\n\nGen Z is generally defined as encompassing those aged between 13 and 28 (born between 1997 and 2012), with millennials aged between 29 and 44 (born between 1981 and 1996).\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative impact of smartphones and social media: 56 per cent of participants said social media left them feeling distressed, distracted and significantly impacted their mental health. Almost all participants (91 per cent) aged 18-39 believed \"social media adversely affected the strength of their real-life interactions\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline dating apps lead to loneliness: 46 per cent shared that online dating apps \"increased how lonely they felt\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMany workplaces are not mentally healthy: 67 per cent of gen Z and millennial respondents support a shorter work week to reduce loneliness and improve their mental health. \"Workplace bullying is at an epidemic level, with one-third of women having reported being bullied\", the report added.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of living crisis is a mental health crisis: It stopped 86 per cent of gen Z and millennial respondents from pursuing their dreams and ambitions.\n\n\n\nAustralia's mental health data\n\nThe National Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing for 2020-2022, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), surveyed Australians in the 16-85 age group, which totalled 19.8 million people.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Of these, 42.9 per cent or 8.5 million Australians had experienced a mental disorder at some time in their life.\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of these 19.8 million Australians, only 17.4 per cent or 3.4 million, sought help from a health professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey also found that one in five Australians has experienced a 12-month mental disorder, with 38.8 per cent of people aged 16-24 experiencing a 12-month mental disorder.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most prevalent conditions include anxiety, affective disorders (including depression) and substance abuse.\n\n\n\nHidden mental health workers\n\nLike Delbridge, the Foundation for Social Health also believes that mental health conversations don't just start at the hospital. Those suffering disclose trauma, stress and isolation to people who aren\u2019t part of the formal mental health system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report states: \"These informal, unrecognised interactions are the quiet frontlines of our mental health system. And yet, public policy barely acknowledges them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom hairdressers to hospitality staff, gym trainers and childcare educators \u2014 all are part of this \"hidden workforce.\" Their clients confide in them very often \"because those are the places they actually go\".\n\n\n\nBut for some, like salon owner Nicole Serafin, this can present challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We get told about everything from affairs, to drug and alcohol abuse, to physical and mental abuse from partners, family and friends, and you can\u2019t do anything about it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said while trained psychiatrists have a buddy system: \"hairdressers are not qualified to handle what we take on\".\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Pramudie Gunaratne is chair of the NSW branch of the Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\n\nIn January, around 200 psychiatrists in NSW's public health system submitted their resignations amid an ongoing pay dispute with the state government. Source: AAP / Dan Himbrechts \"As psychiatrists, we are trained in caring for mental illness, but mental health is much wider than that \u2026 When we see people in emergency departments and clinic rooms, they are overwhelmed, at crisis point,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Social connection is required all the time. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s prevention or early intervention, having that glue that holds people together is essential.\"\n\n\n\nAddressing the loneliness epidemic\n\nThis is why Glenys Reid established the first Chatty Cafe at Eclair Boulangerie, a French patisserie in the Melbourne suburb of Hampton in 2019. She recalls visiting cafes and restaurants, seeing many people dining alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferring to loneliness, she says: \"It's an invisible and silent epidemic in Australia that we need to take action on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only way that it\u2019s going to be successful is if it is community-led.\"\n\n\n\nWhile hundreds of places across Australia host 'Have a Chat' venues, Reid says several hospitality venues have shut down in recent years due to cost-of-living pressures. Credit: The Chatty Cafe Scheme More than five years later, The Chatty Cafe Scheme has expanded to over 250 venues mainly across the east coast of Australia, including community centres, op shops, art galleries and even croquet and bowling clubs where patrons can have a chat with other patrons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know seven out of 10 people know we\u2019ve got a problem with loneliness across Australia, we want those seven out of 10 people to play a role and reach out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2023 Social Connection in Australia report, from the Ending Loneliness Together organisation, one in four Australians feel persistent loneliness, and one in three people experience loneliness at any given time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation for Social Health CEO Melanie Wilde is calling for a Commissioner for Social Connection to be established within government.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Experts divided on whether social media ban will be realistic or effective\n\n\"This isn\u2019t a problem you can solve with 7,500 psychiatrists and 30,000 psychologists,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhat we need is a national strategy that funds the places, people, and platforms that keep communities strong \u2014 from pubs to libraries, sports clubs to cafes, gyms to grassroots arts organisations. Melanie Wilde, Foundation for Social Health CEO.\n\nAccording to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, there were 4,300 psychiatrists and 33,000 psychologists in Australia as of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparate inquiries into loneliness in Queensland and the ACT have called for a Minister for Loneliness. A similar inquiry is underway in NSW.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilde welcomes the recommendations from these inquiries, but believes a more permanent position that goes beyond \"cyclical portfolios\" needs to be established.\n\n\n\n'We need a complete reform'\n\nSocial media influencer Milly Rose Bannister, who has 137,000 followers on Instagram, is also the CEO of youth mental health charity ALLKND. Bannister believes the issue is hard to fight with existing resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have inherited a bit of a bin fire and been given a water pistol,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"We've got structures in place that have been in place for decades, and they're simply not matching up to what young people today are requiring for their well-being in general and particularly their mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need a complete reform.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders seeking support with mental health can contact Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636.

When I tried to focus on my task, they broke my focus and I had to jump to another task, even if it was just reading the first sentence of the notifications,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Being distracted is not a good reason to give to your manager ... So I always try my best to finish my work, even if that sometimes means staying [on] after hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is why the IT engineer has chosen to disable notifications on his work device.\n\n\n\n'Constantly bombarded'\n\nFarid is among many Australian workers who have similar experiences every day, according to Microsoft's annual Work Trend Index.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found, during a typical 9-to-5 workday, employees are interrupted every two minutes by \"meetings, emails, or pings\", averaging 275 interruptions a day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent report is based on data from 31,000 workers across 31 countries, including 1,000 from Australia.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Report finds Australians want more flexible work arrangements SBS News 09/09/2024 05:25 Play\n\nHerman Tse, professor of Leadership and Organisational Behaviour at Monash University, said: \"constant emails, instant messengers, meetings, and live streams\" are the main sources of distraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're constantly bombarded by these kinds of instant demands from different sources: boss, peers, subordinates, requests and everything,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Constant disruptions or distractions [will] reduce our cognitive attention ... The more these kinds of situations happen, the less likely we are to concentrate deeply on our work.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The tool that could be giving Millennials and Gen Z an edge when job hunting\n\nThe Microsoft report shows that in Australia, nearly half (47 per cent) of bosses are asking employees to do more, while almost 80 per cent of employees say they lack \"the time or energy to keep up\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what Microsoft's head of modern work, Lucy Debono, describes as a \"capacity gap\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Essentially, we're not running out of work to do, but potentially we're running out of human capacity to do it,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nHow to maintain your focus\n\nThere are several traditional solutions to help workers stay focused and deal with the 'capacity gap'.\n\n\n\n\n\nTse suggests that office workers \"don't attend redundant meetings\" all the time, and could shift from \"time management to attention management\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Try to block 90 minutes every morning, maybe from 9am to 10.30am \u2014 this is what we call the focus time. During this window, turn off the notifications of any digital devices and delegate the routine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without a clear structure of what I call a compass, an internal compass to focus on attention rather than only on time management, people will feel more fatigued.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the modern-day workplace has access to new techniques to handle work distractions and improve efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Maria is struggling to get ahead at work. She wonders if her accent is to blame\n\nThe AI 'thought partner'\n\nThese methods are used in \"frontier firms,\" companies that work based on human and AI teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AI can help to bridge this capacity gap,\" Debono said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Turning to AI as that thought partner, like you would talk to a colleague, a friend, a teammate, that's where you start to get the real sort of value and return from an interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Asking an AI [agent] to help organise your day, to summarise your emails, to prioritise your tasks, really helps you to stay much more focused on what you need to deliver and not to get distracted.\"\n\n\n\nRise of the 'agent boss'\n\nThe Microsoft research shows that 40 per cent of employees in Australia use AI as a thought partner, which is 12 per cent less than the average in Asia-Pacific countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Microsoft, AI agents are an AI-powered system that can reason, plan and act to complete tasks or entire workflows autonomously, with human oversight at key moments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Work Trend Index report predicts that in future, we will \"see the rise of the agent boss \u2014 someone who builds, delegates to, and manages [AI] agents to amplify their impact\".\n\n\n\nDebono said: \"The research tells us that many leaders today see agents as a means to address the issue and help reduce the level of distraction in various ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we see from this research is where human and agent teams come together, that's where we're going to have the most impact, the highest efficiency and human skills.\"\n\n\n\n'Replaced by AI sooner rather than later'\n\nThe Microsoft report also shows that 40 per cent of business leaders report they are already using AI agents to fully automate their workstreams. Seventy-five per cent say they will use these agents in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a significant number of people say they don't trust using AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 study by the University of Queensland found that only 34 per cent of Australians are willing to trust AI.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The $3.8 billion reason Australian workers would leave their jobs\n\n\"[Australian companies] are not [at] that forefront right now ... They're still concerned about whether they should trust AI [and] whether [it] will expose their information and will put them into danger,\" Tse said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They still have a strong, what we call, psychosocial risk. That means wherever they rely more on AI, they show their employees that the human value of a job becomes less important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They'd be afraid that they were more likely to be replaced by AI sooner rather than later.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "As Australia heads into the final days before the 2025 federal election , political advertisements have disappeared from TV and radio.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's due to a long-standing media blackout law designed to give voters space to make up their minds before polling day.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the age of social media, it's unlikely you'll actually feel like you're in a blackout \u2014 something that's prompting questions about just how effective it really is.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what the election blackout laws cover, why they were introduced, and why some are now calling them a \"relic\" of the past.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE These Australian influencers are trying to sway your vote. So we got them to debate each other\n\nWhat are the media blackout laws?\n\nJust before every federal election, there's a short window of peace and quiet before Australians head to the polls. Well, at least on our TVs and radios.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's because from 12am Thursday 1 May until polls close at 6pm on Saturday, broadcasters are banned from airing election ads.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is called the media blackout period, and it applies to:\n\n\n\nCommercial TV and radio broadcasters\n\nSubscription television broadcasters\n\nAnd class-licensed services, like community TV or narrowcast radio.\n\nAccording to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), the blackout provides a \"cooling off period\" so voters can make up their minds without last-minute media blitzes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you still feel like you're seeing ads everywhere, you're not alone.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The voters who could see more misinformation this election\n\nWhy you'll still be bombarded with political ads\n\nThe blackout period only applies to broadcast media, which means there are many platforms that are not restricted by it, including print media and online media.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exemption includes:\n\n\n\nSocial media (like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok)\n\nStreaming services (like YouTube or Spotify)\n\nNews websites or newspapers\n\nText messages and emails\n\n'A relic of the 1980s'\n\nFree TV Australia, the industry body representing free-to-air TV, has labelled the election blackout a \"relic of the 1980s\".\n\n\n\n\n\nFree TV Australia CEO Bridget Fair told SBS News: \"It's completely out of step with today's media landscape.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's absurd that broadcasters are banned from airing political ads in the final days before an election, while unregulated digital platforms are free to flood voters with content right up to \u2014 and including \u2014 polling day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFair argued the rules are outdated given how many people now vote early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By election day, the majority of Australians will have already voted \u2014 many after seeing political ads on TV, online and everywhere in between. Yet somehow, traditional broadcasters are the only ones silenced,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAEC estimated more than 4.03 million people have already voted in this election, a 26 per cent jump since 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFair has called for reform on the blackout, saying it \"serves no purpose in a digital world and only penalises regulated, responsible media\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the system creates a regulatory loophole that \"undermines transparency\" and shifts influence and ad dollars to \"unregulated tech giants\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Regulation must evolve with the times ... especially during election periods when access to clear, trustworthy information is most vital to voters,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked for comment about their stance on the election blackout period, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) said: \"Any changes to the rules would be a matter for parliament to consider.\"\n\n\n\nSo, does H Fong have to stop texting me?\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final stretch of this campaign has been defined by one guest in our phones: H Fong from the Trumpet of Patriots party.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians across the country have reported a deluge of texts from the party \u2014 even after blocking numbers and despite never signing up for any correspondence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AEC has confirmed these messages don't breach election advertising rules and the blackout period doesn't apply to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, while the TV ads might be quieting down, your scroll \u2014 and your phone \u2014 probably won't be.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

We weren't able to receive that,\" Albanese said in Perth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the last time \u2026 that you would want to have a divisive debate about religion.\n\n\n\n\"I'm up for legislation that has broad support, but we do not need further issues created. I've been about turning the temperature down on those issues, which is what social cohesion requires.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor promised at the 2022 election to introduce legislation outlawing discrimination against LGBTIQ+ students and staff at religious schools, as well discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs or lack thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the laws were withdrawn last year, Opposition legal affairs spokesperson Michaelia Cash described cross-party negotations as \"one of the most bizarre processes I have seen in my time in parliament\".\n\n\n\nFaith groups first called for the legislation after the 2017 legalisation of marriage equality, concerned about the impacts of the new laws on their expression of religious belief, but successive attempts to pass legislation have fallen short.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Turnbull government commissioned a review chaired by former attorney-general Philip Ruddock, with former prime minister Scott Morrison proposing and then withdrawing Coalition legislation in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nLGBTIQ+ groups have also expressed dismay at the lack of progress on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted the Opposition for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\nCelebrated US cocktail group Death & Co is set to open bars in Melbourne and Brisbane this spring. The new locations will be the group\u2019s first permanent bars outside North America. Australian Venue Co, which operates more than 200 pubs and bars across the country, is partnering with Death & Co to run the Australian outposts. The original Death & Co opened in New York\u2019s East Village in 2006 and has expanded to Los Angeles, Denver and Washington. Death & Co started in New York but has since expanded to four North American cities. The New York bar was a key player in the global craft cocktail renaissance of the late 2000s, popularising modern classics such as the Naked & Famous (mezcal, Aperol, Chartreuse and lime). \u201cWe\u2019ve admired Death & Co\u2019s work for some time now and have teamed up with them on a number of pop-up events at our venues in the past, so this has felt like a natural extension of our shared vision,\u201d said Ben Hehir, Australian Venue Co\u2019s head of training and development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHiring for venue managers has already begun, which will include three weeks of training experience at Death & Co sites in North America. Death & Co\u2019s Washington location (pictured) is one of four in North America, with a fifth on the way. Australian Venue Co operates venues including Melbourne\u2019s Beer DeLuxe at Fed Square, St Kilda\u2019s revitalised Hotel Esplanade and Brisbane spots The Boundary Hotel and Lefty\u2019s Music Hall. The partnership may raise some eyebrows in bartending circles, at least privately. The group is more associated with sprawling pubs than singular cocktail bars. While the bar locations in Melbourne and Brisbane are under wraps, comments from Australian Venue Co suggest they\u2019ll be slotted inside existing venues. Hehir said the focus was on delivering craft cocktails and a New York-inspired bar experience \u201cwith the same welcoming atmosphere our pubs are known for\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Flying high or calling last drinks: What\u2019s happening with your favourite Melbourne bars? Rob Libecans of Caretaker\u2019s Cottage, ranked No. 21 on the latest World\u2019s 50 Best Bars list, thinks the Australian venture is a great sign of things to come. \u201cA rising tide lifts all ships,\u201d he said. \u201cProven operators [coming in] with a history of success, a deep level of experience and training opportunities for Australian hospitality workers can only be a benefit to Melbourne.\u201d Matthew Linklater, a former manager at Black Pearl in Fitzroy who now works in hospitality consulting, agrees. \u201cDeath & Co entering our market is a huge vote of confidence in the Australian cocktail scene, which has historically been among the world\u2019s best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also great news for classic cocktail drinkers after a tough couple of years of bar closures.

    "text": "However, Jones cuts a different figure to the combative coach I\u2019ve come to know while covering rugby for the best part of a decade, including a Rugby World Cup final in 2019.\n\nHerald reporter Tom Decent interviews former Wallabies coach Eddie Jones, who is now in charge of Japan. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nThat we\u2019re sitting opposite each other in Sydney on the morning of Anzac Day would surprise many.\n\nIt is our first proper interaction since December 2023, when I flew to Tokyo to grill Jones as he was unveiled as Japan\u2019s new rugby coach at a packed press conference, after months of repeated denials.\n\nWe are in the final moments of a 45-minute interview at an ocean pool cafe in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nThese are words I never expected to hear from Eddie Jones.\n\nI apologise, mate. Serious. I didn\u2019t try to piss you off mate, but you know, I probably did treat you unprofessionally, so I apologise mate.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nDoing a straight news story from an interview with Jones didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nI have had a rocky history with Jones, particularly given that story. Jones repeatedly and publicly questioned my integrity, prompting plenty of online trolling.\n\nJones is now Japan\u2019s head coach, having denied links to the job more than a dozen times.\n\nJones eventually resigned with four years left on his contract after a disappointing Wallabies performance saw them knocked out in the pool stages of a World Cup for the first time in their history.\n\nIn 2023, during the World Cup in France, the Herald broke the story that Jones, who was then the Wallabies coach, had taken part in a Zoom interview for the Japan job just before the start of the tournament.\n\nSo, how did we get here?\n\nGiven that background, I was initially reluctant when asked by my sports editor to approach Jones for this interview.\n\nI asked Jones why he\u2019d sent the message and never heard back. He blocked my number.\n\nJones felt the line of questioning was too negative. The team had lost all four matches that year as they headed off for the World Cup.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever contact me again,\u201d he texted me out of the blue, minutes after a press conference at Sydney airport during which he told journalists to \u201cgive yourselves uppercuts\u201d.\n\nA WhatsApp message Jones sent to me on August 17, before the World Cup, sums up our fractious relationship at rugby\u2019s showpiece event.\n\nI will probably always be associated with Jones. There was a time when it was all anyone wanted to talk to me about.\n\nEarlier this month, Jones coached Japan\u2019s under-23s rugby side against Randwick, the club he grew up playing for.\n\nWas this his way of opening the door?\n\nOne day, I opened up WhatsApp and noticed I could see Jones\u2019 profile again (a picture of his dog). He had unblocked me.\n\nMaybe for an interview. Perhaps a quiet drink. But I was still blocked.\n\nOccasionally, I had contemplated reaching out to the coach I used to be on a text-message basis with.\n\nTo be honest, I thought it was more likely that I would replace Joe Schmidt as Wallabies coach than Jones agree to meet up for a chat.\n\n\u201cOk, yes, can do mate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know you [are] doing your job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know we spoke briefly yesterday. My editors wanted to see if you would be up for a sit-down interview and some photos if you are still in town.\u201d\n\n\u201cG\u2019day Eddie, it\u2019s Tom Decent,\u201d read my text message to Jones a few days later on April 16.\n\nAt full-time, a group of rugby journalists huddled around Jones to grab some quotes. I joined in, but was in no mood for a fight, so asked only one question.\n\nWallabies great Simon Poidevin joked to onlookers that the half-time entertainment would be Jones and me with boxing gloves on.\n\nBefore the match at Coogee Oval, we shook hands near the grandstand, but didn\u2019t exchange words.\n\nAlthough it was my day off, and I had an early morning half-marathon planned, we agreed to meet at 9am at Wylie\u2019s Baths; a beautiful ocean pool that looks over Coogee Beach.\n\n\u2018Did you bring your swimmers?\u2019\n\nI arrive before Jones. I don\u2019t know what to expect and can\u2019t say I\u2019m looking forward to it.\n\nThere\u2019s a temptation to go in all guns blazing, but what would that really achieve?\n\nI texted Jones before he arrives: \u201cWould you like a coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cLong black, mate.\u201d\n\nWithin moments, he arrives, offering a limp handshake.\n\n\u201cHey Tom. How are you going mate? Did you bring your swimmers?\u201d he asks.\n\nHe\u2019s casually dressed in a grey, long-sleeve top, track pants and blue joggers, with an Omega watch and brown reading glasses hanging from his collar.\n\nWe make our way to a large wooden table in a quiet corner of Wylie\u2019s, along with Herald photographer Dominic Lorrimer.\n\nHerald reporter Tom Decent sits down with Eddie Jones. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nWe have decided not to record the interview on camera.\n\nJones normally loves the cameras. He has publicly eviscerated countless reporters, including myself, at press conferences over the years. He toys with journalists like a shark and its prey.\n\nAn interview Jones did with The Times rugby reporter Owen Slot has always stuck with me. Having agreed to meet Slot, a fierce critic of his coaching methods, at a Parisian bar in May last year, Jones finished the interview by telling Slot: \u201cI find you very negative. You\u2019re a spiteful person. I feel sad for you.\u201d\n\nI am not here for a headline. Jones gave enough of those during his whirlwind nine months as Wallabies coach - the second time around - to last a career.\n\nThis is about understanding the man behind the facade and why he didn\u2019t just admit to the Australian rugby public that his heart was set on returning to Japan, who he had previously coached between 2012 and 2015.\n\nI am hoping Jones will open up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested that you\u2019ve agreed to chat,\u201d I say as I hit record on my phone.\n\n\u201cMate, you\u2019re just doing your job,\u201d Jones says. \u201cSo I\u2019m happy to chat mate. Let\u2019s see how we go.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones at Wylie\u2019s Baths. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nIt\u2019s a positive \u2013 and unexpected \u2013 start.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like being back here in a place that means so much to you?\u201d an easy question to start things off.\n\nJones\u2019 eyes dart over my left shoulder to the beach, which is getting busier by the minute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to come home,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling this is where you were raised, and a lot of the values and behaviours you have come from what happened in this area.\n\n\u201cIt changes so much, though. You\u2019re walking down Coogee now and it\u2019s completely different to what it was. It\u2019s hard to find people that are from Coogee. The great thing about Australia is the beauty of nature and you see that here with the beautiful Wylie\u2019s Baths.\u201d\n\nWe will get onto the Zoom interview, but timing is everything with Jones.\n\nHe is as punctual as they come. He has already made it clear he has to leave at 9.45am sharp for a 10am meeting.\n\nWhat are Jones\u2019 fondest memories of the area, as a kid growing up down the road in La Perouse?\n\n\u201cEither playing cricket or rugby for Randwick on Coogee Oval,\u201d Jones says. \u201c[Former Wallaby] Glen Ella was at the game on Saturday. I remember one day we were warming up for a cricket game and [former Randwick coach] Jeff Sayle said, \u2018Where else would you want to be today? Sun shining on your back and you\u2019re playing for Randwick\u2019. Those memories never leave you.\u201d\n\nSayle died when Jones was coaching England at the 2019 World Cup in Japan.\n\nHe told me at the time, via text message, he wanted to fly back to Australia to be at Sayle\u2019s funeral.\n\nIn 2022, Eddie Jones was presented with his old Randwick jersey, found at the home of the late Jeffrey Sayle.\n\nUltimately, it proved to be too hard, but Jones began a press conference the next day by paying tribute to one of his greatest coaching influences.\n\nIt was the first time I\u2019d seen Jones get emotional. The only other time was when Jones was unveiled as Wallabies coach in early 2023 at his former school, Matraville High.\n\nIt is why Jones, who first became an international coach when he took over the Wallabies in 2001, says he has unfinished business at Randwick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019m 65 now. I\u2019ve made a life out of coaching, and it all came from what I experienced at Randwick. At some stage, I want to come and give back to Randwick.\u201d\n\n\u2018That was a bit of theatre, mate\u2019\n\nThis is Jones\u2019 first visit back to Australia since his last Wallabies stint ended in disaster.\n\nJones has also been busy observing his former England assistants Anthony Siebold (Manly Sea Eagles) and Jason Ryles (Parramatta Eels) as they coach in the NRL.\n\nHe was spotted in both coaches\u2019 boxes at NRL games, which did not go down well with some.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked, ropeable, flabbergasted, disappointed, dismayed and taken aback by the sight of a traitor in the Manly box,\u201d said Eddy Simpson, one half of the hugely popular Hello Sport Podcast.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, Eddie Jones is and remains a traitor given what he did to the nation.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones was announced as Japan\u2019s new head coach in December 2023. Jones repeatedly said he was not interested in the role. Credit: Viola Kam\n\nSimpson would not be alone in his view.\n\nDoes Jones care about his reputation, or think Wallabies fans will get stuck into him?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t really care mate,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re entitled to have their opinion. If they want to do that, fair enough. If they don\u2019t want to do that, good as gold.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Jones has been accused of being a turncoat. In 2022, when Jones was coaching England against the Wallabies in a game at the SCG, an Australian fan labelled him a traitor. A furious Jones had to be held back by security guards as he confronted the fan.\n\n\u201cThat was a bit of theatre, mate,\u201d Jones says as he leans in. \u201cI gave it back. You\u2019re always looking for ways to create better situations for your team. For an English team with an Australian coach, to make a deal of that just reinforces the bond between you and the team.\n\n\u201cHe was out of order. But I could have walked past. That happens a lot.\u201d\n\nIs Jones expecting more of the same from Wallabies fans when Australia hosts the Rugby World Cup in 2027? Does he have a message for any fans wanting to heckle him?\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that I came back with the best intentions,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a plan of what we needed to do. Rugby Australia agreed on the plan.\n\n\u201cMy intention was to go back and coach at [Japanese club side] Suntory [after being sacked by England]. Then Australia presented this case to me. I was very, very strong about the fact that I was only going to come back and make big changes. Australian rugby needs a revolution. I still believe that to get back to one or two or three in the world ...\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve heard this spiel before.\n\nEddie Jones at his press conference after Australia\u2019s 40-6 loss to Wales. Credit: Getty\n\nOur photographer is ready for some portraits, so we pause the interview.\n\nI tell Jones I\u2019ll grab our coffees, which are now nine minutes colder.\n\nThe conversation is flowing easier than expected.\n\nJones is now down at sea level posing for some portraits as the tide comes in. The symbolism is striking, as the salt water drenches his shoes.\n\n\u201cThe salt water won\u2019t hurt,\u201d Jones says with his feet completely underwater.\n\n\u201c2023 was such a rush, mate,\u201d he says. \u201cApart from being at it all the time, I just felt I was rushing the whole time. There was a wave coming in, and I was behind the wave the whole time.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nAs I hold our photographer\u2019s light, Jones and I chat rugby league. It\u2019s the game we both grew up on.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got Lachlan Galvin,\u201d says Jones of the Eels\u2019 bid to swoop on the teenage five-eighth when he leaves the Wests Tigers.\n\nAs we walk to another area, I\u2019ve somehow ended up with Jones\u2019 blue Canterbury hat in my hand. It\u2019s very different to the Akubra he wore while berating me and others at Sydney Airport on the eve of the World Cup when we asked questions about him leaving Michael Hooper and Quade Cooper out of the squad.\n\nA few locals are now watching Jones, but this is a much quieter spot than a bustling cafe.\n\nAs Jones poses for more photos, I tell him that he\u2019s standing on the very spot where I met my now wife in December 2020.\n\n\u201cDo you live around here mate? What does your wife do for work?\u201d he asks.\n\nEddie Jones poses for a portrait in Coogee. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nHis warmth is slightly disarming. He asks about my (failed) cricket career and why I got into journalism. Not topics I expected him to care about. Maybe he doesn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019re now sitting at the same table and back on the record again. Jones picks up his lukewarm long black and takes a sip.\n\nI still want answers.\n\n\u2018I wanted to start a rugby revolution\u2019\n\n\u201cDo you feel sorry for [former Wallabies coach] Dave Rennie,\u201d I ask. \u201cHe wanted to stay on and wasn\u2019t afforded that chance after being sacked in 2022.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always feel for a coach who gets sacked,\u201d Jones says. \u201cCoaching is a great thing to do but there are times when the results don\u2019t match the amount of work you put in. I feel for Dave.\u201d\n\nWhen Jones was appointed Wallabies coach, he invited some journalists for a drink at the Captain Cook Hotel in Paddington. By the end of the session, Jones, who didn\u2019t touch any alcohol, had criticised all of us for going too easy on the Wallabies. We all agreed he mustn\u2019t have really read our stories.\n\nWhy did he do it?\n\n\u201cI just think we needed to change the standards in Australian rugby,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019m still of that opinion, mate.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at where we want to get to\u2026\u201d\n\nJones stops himself. He realises he\u2019s used the word \u2018we\u2019. In an alternate universe, Jones is still in charge of Australia, talking up the Wallabies\u2019 chances of beating the British and Irish Lions in a blockbuster series on home soil.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying \u2018we\u2019. It\u2019s not \u2018we\u2019 now,\u201d Jones says quietly.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about it walking down here. There were two things I tried to address. One: the training intensity. Two: the behaviours of the players on and off the field. I wanted to start a rugby revolution.\u201d\n\nHamish McLennan with Eddie Jones and Andy Marinos after Jones\u2019 appointment in January 2023. Credit: Getty Images\n\nYou sold a big dream to the public, I tell him.\n\n\u201cWell, I still think that is the dream,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to back yourself to do it, and so I failed. I don\u2019t feel like I shouldn\u2019t have sold the dream because that\u2019s the dream we should have in Australian rugby.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough to play down here with guys like the Ellas. There\u2019s players in Australia who can be even better than the Ellas. But we let them go to rugby league and other sports. We\u2019ve got to make sure we keep them.\n\n\u201cYou could argue [Joseph-Aukuso] Suaalii\u2019s form has been worth every cent.\u201d\n\nThen a headline arrives. Jones says he is confident Dolphins halfback Isaiya Katoa and Canberra Raiders winger Xavier Savage would be playing for the Wallabies if he was still in charge.\n\n\u201cNo one knew that we had that plan in place,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThey were both going to be off contract.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a moot point. The Wallabies lost their first four matches under Jones, but he maintains Australia should have beaten New Zealand in Dunedin after leading at half-time.\n\nEddie Jones before a 2023 Bledisloe Cup match in Dunedin. Credit: Getty\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that people are disappointed in the way it ended,\u201d Jones says. \u201cYou never like to upset people like that. Even yourself, mate. I can sit here comfortably and say I committed myself 100 per cent to make it work, and it just didn\u2019t end up in the end.\u201c\n\nIt feels like the door is being opened to broach the Japan subject. Deep breath.\n\nMy mother would say, \u2018Is what Tom is saying right\u2019?\n\nI ask Jones what his version of events are when it comes to the Zoom interview he took with JRFU officials while in camp with the Wallabies in France.\n\nJones\u2019 response is unsurprising.\n\n\u201cStill the same as I said before, mate,\u201d Jones says with a piercing gaze. \u201cWe are not going to agree on this. You\u2019ve got what you think is right.\n\n\u201cI gave them some advice on who they should pick to be the next head coach. The next discussion I had with them [Japan] was after leaving Australia.\u201d\n\nAs in telling Japan who they should select?\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\nThere is no point flogging a dead horse. The Herald stands by the story 100 per cent. We obtained screenshots that show the Zoom call Jones logged onto, with a personal email address, had a title that read: \u201cJRFU 1st Round Interviews with M15 HC Candidates.\u201d\n\nScreenshots show the JRFU\u2019s Zoom meeting room titled \u2018First round interview, Eddie Jones\u2019, and the personal email address from which Jones accepted the invitation. Credit: Illustration: Aresna Villanueva\n\nJones can\u2019t explain this.\n\nThe nature of the discussions on the call made it clear it was an interview.\n\nMeanwhile, applications for the role closed on August 18, according to a confidential candidate briefing document published at the time by this masthead.\n\nJones had claimed there was only a recruitment company on the call, but has now conceded JRFU officials were there too. The Herald knows who those officials were.\n\nFor weeks, Jones denied a call of any kind had even existed. The Herald has other proof.\n\nThe story broke on the morning of the Wales game, which Australia effectively needed to win to guarantee their place in the quarter-finals.\n\nA few days earlier, the Herald went to Rugby Australia for a comment. I would have messaged Jones directly, but my number was blocked. He\u2019d also made it clear he never wanted to hear from me again.\n\nInstead of telling us the story was wrong, Jones declined to comment. It was telling.\n\nEddie Jones at Wylie\u2019s Baths. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nI ask Jones whether the story was a distraction.\n\n\u201cI can honestly say, mate, it didn\u2019t really worry me because I was so worried about the Wales game,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI knew without [Taniela] Tupou and [Will Skelton] we were under the pump, and it was going to be a difficult game to beat Wales.\u201d\n\nDid he sense Australia were about to be thrashed 40-6 by Wales?\n\n\u201cI always thought it was going to be a difficult game.\u201d\n\nWhen Australia were knocked out of the World Cup, did Jones know then his Wallabies days were numbered?\n\n\u201cEven at that stage - and I know you\u2019ll debate this - [Wallabies general manager] Chris Webb and I were driving the fact we were going to restructure Australian rugby,\u201d Jones says. \u201cWe had the agreement of the Rugby Committee [Phil Waugh and Dan Herbert].\u201d\n\nWe agree to disagree and move on.\n\nEddie Jones ahead of Australia\u2019s Test against Wales at the World Cup. Credit: Getty\n\n\u201cDid you think my reporting at the time was unfair?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cIn essence, mate, I only heard bits and pieces,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI don\u2019t read anything. When I became England coach, I made a pact that I\u2019d never read anything any more. I only hear things.\n\n\u201cThough my mother would say, \u2018Is what Tom is saying right?\u2019 My sister would ask am I alright. You hear all these sort of things. But I never really read it.\u201d\n\n\u2018You want to be at a place where someone loves you\u2019\n\nThis is my last crack at the Japan issue.\n\nTD: But Eddie, you must have had people hammering you, asking if you were going to Japan?\n\nEJ: Post the World Cup, private equity was off and the states were starting to beat the drum. I was told when I joined that the states had agreed to this new restructuring of Australian rugby. Then by the middle of the World Cup, we\u2019re hearing that Queensland and the Brumbies are not in. It\u2019s unravelling. I went in with the intention of a five-year plan but by that meeting in Paris with the Rugby Committee, I knew it was going to be difficult. Even then, I was still committed.\n\nTD: Really?\n\nEJ: Things are starting to look a bit shaky. You met your wife down there, right?\n\nA confused look must have come across my face as Jones points down to the pool.\n\nEJ: You\u2019re both committed to each other. But if the other half\u2019s not committed \u2026 you want to be at a place where someone loves you, right? And when they\u2019re not loving you, then you\u2019re starting to think this is a bit shaky. I can\u2019t say that at a press conference mate. How can I say that? I still wanted to make it happen.\n\nEddie Jones fronts the media at Coogee Oval in October 2023. Credit: Steven Siewert\n\nTD: So you pretended like it was all OK?\n\nEJ: There\u2019s always a backstory. Sometimes you can tell that, and sometimes you can\u2019t. I could tell you stuff about players or how the team operated, but it doesn\u2019t help anyone now. I got criticised a lot for selection. I could say things about the players.\n\nTD: As in players not being up to scratch?\n\nEJ: Yep.\n\nTD: The comment about Michael Hooper and some other senior figures not being the right role models for the team spring to mind. Do you stand by that?\n\nEJ: I don\u2019t want to criticise any players. I just felt we needed a new set of standards. I don\u2019t know whether I could have got them from those boys. It\u2019s always difficult, particularly players who have been really good. In the circumstances, what could I have done better? I probably should have planned their exits better.\n\nTD: When it all ended with Australia, how were you feeling?\n\nEJ: Really disappointed. There\u2019s probably no one more Australian than me. I wanted to come back and I wanted to do a great job for Australia. I failed. So you carry the personal failure. You don\u2019t like to make fans feel terrible.\n\nThe Wallabies had a World Cup to forget in France. Credit: Getty\n\nTD: What happened next?\n\nEJ: We stayed here. I was living out of a suitcase a whole year. My wife (Hiroko) was in between England and Japan and here. We also lost our dog (Annie), which was like our daughter. Personally, it wasn\u2019t a great year behind the scenes. But again, that\u2019s no excuse.\n\nTD: After that airport press conference you texted me: \u201cDon\u2019t ever contact me again.\u201d Why did you do it? I later learned about your dog. I\u2019m sorry to hear about that.\n\nEJ: I probably didn\u2019t recognise it at the time, but it [the dog passing away] probably had an effect on me. You try to put those things away, mate. I\u2019m not making this as an excuse at all, but yeah, that disruption to the family probably did affect me in some way.\n\nTD: Were you aware that if you ended up as Japan\u2019s head coach you\u2019d look like you were being loose with the truth?\n\nEJ: Yeah. You can\u2019t help that.\n\nTD: Your presentation in your final interview in Tokyo must have been excellent. (Jones maintains this was his only interview with the JRFU, six days before he was announced as Japan\u2019s head coach. However, applications for the role had closed 110 days earlier).\n\nEJ: [Pauses]. I don\u2019t know. Obviously, I got the job. The funny thing was post Australia I\u2019m thinking, \u2018shit, this is not good\u2019, right? I wanted to prove I can coach. You\u2019re only as good as your last game.\n\nHerald reporter Tom Decent at a press conference in Tokyo where Eddie Jones was unveiled as Japan\u2019s rugby coach. Credit: Viola Kam\n\nTD: How have you found the Japan job? Last year they had a review into the program and your position. (Japan won just four of 11 Tests in 2024, with those victories coming against Canada, USA, Samoa and Uruguay).\n\nEJ: They haven\u2019t beaten a top 10 country since 2019, but there is a perception they are doing well. It\u2019s just going to be hard work. I think we\u2019ll have one more year of pain, and then I reckon we\u2019ll be in a position where we can compete for longer periods. By 2027, I\u2019ve got no doubt we can have a team that can win [matches] at the World Cup.\n\nTD: Some of the criticism must have hurt. What about [Wallabies great] Phil Kearns effectively saying you were a liar and had deceived the Australian rugby public?\n\nEJ: I never worry about what people say, unless they say it to your face. I can be criticised for a lot of things, mate. If I criticise myself, the biggest criticism I have for myself was that I thought I could do it quickly. Maybe I got a bit carried away. I couldn\u2019t make the dream a reality. Most good things don\u2019t happen quickly, but I probably thought I could do it, which was an overestimation of my ability.\n\nEddie Jones. Credit: Illustration: Stephen Kiprillis\n\n\u2018I probably did treat you unprofessionally\u2019\n\nTime has crept up on us both. I have some two-up to play, while Jones has that 10am meeting before he heads to the Roosters-Dragons match at Allianz Stadium.\n\nAny regrets, Eddie?\n\n\u201cI do regret the airport press conference. I lost control there. You never want to lose control.\u201d\n\nAs I lean in to grab my phone, I tell Jones that I appreciate him giving up his time.\n\n\u201cI apologise, mate. Serious,\u201d he says before a short pause. This is the sincerest I\u2019ve ever seen Jones.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t try to piss you off mate, but you know, I probably did treat you unprofessionally, so I apologise mate.\u201d\n\nJones thanks me for the coffee, offers a slightly firmer handshake, before leaving Wylie\u2019s.\n\nEddie Jones after a 45-minute interview with the Herald. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nJones doesn\u2019t know it, but he outfoxed me twice during the end of 2023.\n\nWe got a tip that Jones was flying from Sydney to Tokyo once he\u2019d quit as Wallabies coach. I spent three hours circling the international terminal on a Saturday night, only to later learn he had caught a morning flight instead.\n\nA few weeks later, I found out the Tokyo hotel where Jones was going to have his second interview with the JRFU.\n\nThe Herald had a photographer waiting, but he never caught a glimpse of him arriving. We had the story but no killer photo.\n\nAs I walk away, I spot Jones waiting for a taxi. He\u2019s about a pitching wedge away from his old mate Poidevin\u2019s place.\n\n\u201cYou heading to Poido\u2019s house?\u201d\n\nJones laughs as we part ways.\n\nA few minutes later, my phone pings. It\u2019s a text from Jones. Drama?\n\n\u201cThanks for coffee,\u201d he writes. He\u2019d already said thank you.\n\nLoading\n\nI reply: \u201cNo prob. Really appreciate you doing that. Think it was good for both of us. Wish you all the best mate. Enjoy the league.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, probably right mate!\u201d Jones writes. \u201cI really don\u2019t like bad blood, so you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nThe next time we see each other could be in October when the Wallabies face Japan in Tokyo.\n\nExpect fireworks. Just maybe not between us.\n\nWatch all the action from the 2025 Super Rugby Pacific season on Stan Sport, the only place to watch every match, live and on demand.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Unlike Pinocchio, the real-life Tiger Woods and tennis\u2019s Williams sisters, Craig Fitzgibbon was not turned on the lathe of his father\u2019s ambition. Fitzgibbon, the 47-year-old coach of the Sharks since 2022, is a premiership player, as is his father Allan, who also coached Cronulla between 1988-91. Despite their football club backgrounds being almost as parallel as the uprights through which Craig kicked goals to become the highest points-scoring forward in premiership history, Allan never sought to shape his son\u2019s career or reap its rewards. (After all, any generational family coaching Sydney\u2019s poorest club, such as the earlier example of John and Aaron Raper, knows you don\u2019t coach the Sharks for money). Craig Fitzgibbon with his father Allan and mother Michelle in 2003. Credit: Greg Totman Allan says, \u201cCraig was a ballboy with me at Cronulla, but once he started getting into junior rep teams, I stepped aside.\u201d Craig agrees, saying, \u201cMy father let me make my own decisions. He gave advice, but he always left it to me to make the end call. \u201cMum and dad still live in Dapto,\u201d he adds with the unassuming normalcy both families live their lives. \u201cHe goes to the odd game, but doesn\u2019t come to Shark Park home games,\u201d before adding in joking reference to Allan\u2019s role, as a centre, in one of rugby league\u2019s greatest upsets - Balmain beating Souths in the 1969 grand final - \u201cHe goes to about 15 Balmain 1969 reunions a year.\u201d Allan Fitzgibbon playing for Balmain. Credit: Fairfax Media\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig is as closed as an oyster about his own life and is resistant to publicity. He opens up only about his childhood years, saying, \u201cI do remember the joy of coming to the game. I\u2019ve been in and around first-grade dressing sheds since the age of 7. I didn\u2019t realise how fortunate I\u2019ve been until I started bringing my own kids to the football. They love it.\u201d He agrees the pull of the game is akin to a great ocean tide; it churns on relentlessly, with its hold over you greater beneath the surface than above. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around the game most of our lives. I don\u2019t know if we know anything different.\u201d Surely, it is to rugby league\u2019s credit that so many play/coach their father\u2019s game with their father\u2019s name. Craig Fitzgibbon actually took the point-scoring record from Canberra\u2019s David Furner who later coached the club, as did his father, Don. \u2018He goes to about 15 Balmain 1969 reunions a year.\u2019 Craig Fitzgibbon\u2019s cheeky description of his famous father Allan Other NRL combinations are the Clearys at Penrith; the Flanagans at the Dragons, the Fultons at Manly and the Arthurs at Parramatta. The NRLW has Steph Hancock, daughter of early Queensland Origin player, Rohan, as well as Millie Boyle (now Elliott), daughter of Raider, David. The Bulldogs Max King is a fourth-generation player, with father David (Titans), grandfather John (St George) and great-grandfather Cec (South Sydney). The Fitzgibbons are about to become a three-generational rugby league family with Craig\u2019s son Aaymon - a promising five-eighth with the Illawarra Steelers SG Ball team - in demand from a number of NRL clubs. Consistent with Allan\u2019s \u201cadvice only\u201d involvement in Craig\u2019s career, Craig will ensure the Fitzgibbon name will neither be a burden nor a blessing. \u201cAaymon has just starting to talk to a number of clubs,\u201d he said, hinting his son will not be at Cronulla. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to his manager, Dave Riolo. He did eight weeks pre-season training with St George Illawarra before going back to SG Ball. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s best at his age to jump to another club.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig Fitzgibbon playing for the Dragons in 1999. Credit: NRL Imagery While the father of Wests Tigers Lachlan Galvin might take a different view on the future of his 19-year-old son, longstanding St George Illawarra supporters will be heartened by Craig\u2019s preference that his son remains a Dragon. After all, Craig left the club the year after starring in the losing 1999 grand final team. He won\u2019t talk about it, but his ex-teammates still do, sad they lost a player who, had he started the game and St George Illawarra won, would probably have been awarded the Churchill Medal for best on ground. It is a tale of lost opportunity, fuelled by the administrative inertia of the early years of the joint venture. Fitzgibbon waited for days for a contract before the Sydney Roosters made him feel wanted, saying: \u201cHere\u2019s a three-year deal; good money; we want you to play for us and be our goal kicker.\u201d As it transpired, Fitzgibbon won his Churchill Medal in the Roosters\u2019 2002 premiership team. Yet, it is the only grand final he won in five attempts, also losing in 2000, 2003 and 2004. His critics as a coach point to his results with the Sharks, finishing second in 2022 but losing successive finals; sixth in 2023 but fourth in 2024 before a loss to the Storm, a win over the Cowboys, followed by a 26-6 loss to the premiers. Allan, similarly, won the Sharks\u2019 inaugural minor premiership in 1988 followed by successive losses in the finals, while the 1989 and 1990 years were also disappointing. But to blame these results on Fitzgibbon genes is ludicrous. An earlier Cronulla coach, Jack Gibson, was mystified by the Sharks\u2019 finals paralysis. Apart from his quip about waiting for the Sharks to win a premiership being akin to leaving the porch light on for Harold Holt, the ARL Coach of the Century also lamented of Cronulla: \u201cThere is something in the woodwork of the joint.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig Fitzgibbon hugs Sydney Roosters captain Brad Fittler after they won the 2002 title Credit: REUTERS But if rich clubs think the most important factor in winning is spirit, poor clubs know it is money. Another Cronulla coach, John Lang, highlighted this when he said, before Shane Flanagan\u2019s 2016 breakthrough premiership: \u201cPeople ridicule the Sharks for not winning a premiership. It\u2019s a success for the club just to survive a season.\u201d The financial situation at Shark Park is better now, with the NRL funding the salary cap, as well as a $5m administrative grant. Allan Fitzgibbon agrees, saying, \u201cThey\u2019ve had some dramas over the years, but from what I hear, things are pretty stable now.\u201d However, clubs like the Broncos, Panthers and Bulldogs, have resources to provide benefits the Sharks can only envy. Still, it\u2019s a mental barrier, rather than a monetary one the Sharks must break through in 2025 if their end of season is not to resemble a vain man\u2019s 39th birthday - an annual event. Fitzgibbon\u2019s No.7, Nicho Hynes, must learn to take control of games. Asked whether his own future is inextricably linked to the performance in big games of Hynes and to a lesser extent, No.6 Braydon Trindall, Fitzgibbon says, \u201cyep\u201d, before launching into a spirited, off-the-record, defence of them. Nicho Hynes and Craig Fitzgibbon. Credit: NRL Photos After winning the 2022 Dally M medal, Hynes faced helium-filled expectations, but then came two poor State of Origin matches. He\u2019d developed a reputation for either magic or meltdown. At times on the field, Nicho looks like a bank robber surrounded by cops, but lately, with the Sharks 4-4, he usually resembles a traffic cop comfortably in control. Fitzgibbon refuses to elaborate, except to say all top halves have early \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d and it takes time to develop an all-around game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRL\u2019s best player, Penrith\u2019s Nathan Cleary, is yet to dominate Origin. Melbourne\u2019s Jahrome Hughes took six years to progress from a utility who did not play a game on New Zealand\u2019s tour of England to winning the 2024 Dally M Medal for being the game\u2019s best player. \u2018When you tell a player a lie, you shoot yourself in the foot. They will come in droves for you after that.\u2019 Allan Fitzgibbon Cronulla is white-bread territory, suggesting it would embrace the tribal nature of Anglo-Saxon families, despite its insularity. However, the Sharks season launch featured on stage Indigenous Australian, Maori, Samoan and Tongan dance routines from players across the NRL and NRLW, including pathway teams. A cultural banner, incorporating 46 different heritages was unveiled. Fitzgibbon defers all credit to the club\u2019s welfare department for celebrating the increasing diversity in the game. Loading Fitzgibbon is a fundamentally decent man in a profession which breeds paranoia and surliness. His friends say there are only a small number of better people in the world, such as a few mothers and the recently departed Pope. His critics wonder if he lacks the ruthlessness sometimes needed. Yet, above all, players demand honesty, although increasingly, it would seem to be criticism followed by a cuddle.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size To most, they\u2019re pancakes \u2013 but to Torrey Peters, they\u2019re monkey blankets. Eggs are cackleberries, chewing tobacco is Scandihoovian dynamite, and women are skooches and strumpets. Peters immersed herself so deeply in woodcutter slang while writing her remarkable new novella Stag Dance, set in a 19th-century illegal logging camp, that after a day of writing, she\u2019d amuse (and/or annoy) her family and friends by slipping into her lumberjack voice. And she doesn\u2019t just talk the talk. Peters can walk the walk, or in this case, fell the trees. The story was inspired by the time she spent living in her off-grid, 12-by-12, log cabin in rugged Vermont, in the New England region. There\u2019s no running water, just a stream for bathing. There\u2019s an outdoor kitchen and outhouse; a wood stove heats a sauna. Novelist Torrey Peters. Credit: Leonardo Cendamo \u201cI was learning to use a chainsaw because I had to cut the trees for firewood and build a bridge on the logs. Nothing super impressive, but I had to be like This is a spruce, this is a balsam fir. We have beech and maple. I learnt all the different trees and what they do,\u201d Peters says, now safely ensconced in her Brooklyn apartment, flashing mint green nails as she talks. \u201cIt\u2019s a real 1880s lifestyle out there, which means that I\u2019ll go there for a week at a time, but I think some part of my mind would break if I were there super long.\u201d As she worked, Peters wondered about the people who lived such hard and isolated lives, and the experience of the self while alone in the woods, with only the trees to affirm, challenge or question you. \u201cI\u2019m from the Midwest, and I was raised a boy. If you told my 17-year-old self that when you turn 40, you\u2019re going to be in the woods with a chainsaw struggling to build something but feeling grimly pleased with your proficiency, I would have been like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019,\u201d Peters says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never would have thought I\u2019d have transitioned, but I would have been like, that\u2019s a masculine model of being. Well, what does it mean that I did transition and I ended up exactly where my 17-year-old self expected?\u201d She had no answer, but those questions laid the first axe-blow for a novel set in a logging camp. During her research, Peters discovered a historical tradition in American frontier camps where dances were held, and some loggers would attend as women. To signify their role, they would attach an inverted brown triangle of fabric over their crotch \u2013 a practice that becomes a central motif in Stag Dance. Vermont, in the United States, where Torrey Peters owns a tiny cabin. The story follows Babe Bunyan, a large, rugged lumberjack who decides to attend the camp\u2019s stag dance as a woman, placing him in a rivalry with the younger, more feminine Lisen. Set against the grit and grime of an illegal logging camp, the story evokes the poetic sensibilities of authors like Cormac McCarthy and Herman Melville. Loading The lumberjack vernacular \u2014 for which Peters drew on a dictionary of logger slang \u2014 allowed her to approach questions of trans identity through the \u201cside door\u201d. Phrases like gender dysphoria, she says, have had the life sucked out of them through academic, medical, and online discourse. A lumberjack, however, would never have used that phrase in the first place. This forced Peters to think, and write, about how gender dysphoria feels rather than relying on familiar terms. For Babe, it\u2019s summed up in the description: \u201cNo mirror has ever befriended me.\u201d \u201cI had to reinvent a lot of the trans language that, to me, feels ossified,\u201d Peters says. \u201cIt ended up being quite magical for me that I had this new language to find out these things. They became defamilarised and new for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStag Dance gives its name to Peter\u2019s new collection of four stories, each of which deliciously twists familiar genres into unexpected shapes; full of surprises without sacrificing any emotional intensity. The collection also includes Infect Your Friends and Loved Ones, a post-apocalyptic tale where a pandemic renders humans unable to produce sex hormones; the boarding school romance The Chaser; and The Masker, a body horror story set at a cross-dressing convention. Only a few characters are explicitly trans, with Peters more interested in breaking down the binary between trans and cis people, revealing the categories as porous and complex. Peters says the gap between how a person feels in themselves or wants to be seen, and how the world sees them, isn\u2019t an experience unique to trans people. \u201cFor me, coming at it with emotions was the point. Coming at it without identity, without heuristics, or this is how we break it down, is how I am interested in writing these days,\u201d Peters says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I am demanding empathy for trans people. It\u2019s actually more than I\u2019m demanding that readers have empathy for themselves, and I think in having empathy for themselves \u2013 \u201cOh yes, I\u2019ve felt that way before\u201d \u2013 they can maybe then start to make maps of what other people are doing, they can make intellectual maps based on those emotions.\u201d Torrey Peters\u2019 new collection is Stag Dance. Stag Dance is the final story in Torrey Peters\u2019 collection and the only one written after her debut novel, Detransition, Baby, became a bestseller in 2021. That novel \u2013 a comedy of manners about a trio who plan to raise a baby together \u2013 was described by one critic as \u201cthe first great trans realist novel.\u201d Its longlisting for the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction made Peters the first openly trans woman nominated for the award. However, the nomination drew scrutiny, including an open letter condemning Torrey\u2019s eligibility by a group called the Wild Woman Writing Club. Peters wrote at the time that she had received an \u201coutpouring of hate\u201d and expressed hope that the next trans woman to be on the list could at least enjoy the experience more. Peters knows some readers will be disappointed she didn\u2019t write another \u201ctrans Sex in the City\u201d in the style of Detransition, Baby \u2013 and she started work on a financial thriller set in contemporary Brooklyn. But the weight of the expectation felt restrictive, she found liberation a world away from the contemporary in the minds and language of lumberjacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just unexpected for other people. It\u2019s very unexpected for myself. But I think that\u2019s like a really good place to write from, when you\u2019re surprising yourself,\u201d Peters says. \u201cNobody was waiting for this. Nobody was like, \u2018What we want is a lumberjack novel.\u2019 In a lot of ways, that freed me to do whatever I wanted. \u201d Trans people have increasingly found themselves at the centre of public debate and policymaking in the United States with the Trump administration targeting trans people with executive orders. Loading These include an order that the United States will recognise only a person\u2019s sex assigned at birth, and new restrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts, targeting efforts to promote diversity and so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d. In a recent essay for New York Magazine, Peters described how under the Trump administration, her passport would be changed from \u201cF\u201d to \u201cM\u201d and the consequences that would have when she travelled to Colombia, where she owns an apartment. These policies, Peters says, are designed to intimidate and silence. Initially, she felt overwhelmed by the hostility, but over time, she has become more resolute. \u201cI\u2019m meant to be scared. I\u2019m meant to say home. I am meant not to go anywhere, and the M is meant to stop me from doing that sort of stuff,\u201d Peters says.\n\nAdvertisement",

I\u2019d like to not do that again\n\nSimon responded: \u201cYou\u2019re as far off the mark as you possibly could be on this, you already have the facts, however, of course, you\u2019re free to choose to think whatever you want to despite them.\u2033\u2063\n\nSeveral hours after that initial message exchange, Simon said he understood why Erin was \u201cmad\u201d at him but asked her to consider Gail\u2019s feelings. \u201cI know they would love you to be there because they\u2019ve been talking about this and losing sleep over this,\u201d Simon said.\n\nAbout an hour later, Erin messaged Simon again to apologise for lashing out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I lashed out. I was feeling very hurt and lashed out. It\u2019s no excuse. I\u2019d like to not do that again,\u201d she said.\n\nSimon responded by apologising for raising his voice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for that. I\u2019m sorry I raised my voice and my tone, too. I wouldn\u2019t call what either of us did shouting, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re referring to the same thing, no matter what you call it,\u201d he texted.\n\nSimon told the jury the issue had caused a lot of stress for his parents.\n\n\u201cMum and Dad were really stressed about it. They had genuinely believed that they\u2019d invited Erin to the lunch. I think they thought Dad had invited her to the lunch. That\u2019s what happened,\u201d Simon said.\n\nHe said the conversation had occurred around the time he and Erin were discussing child support arrangements following the changes to his tax return status.\n\nThe jury heard that at the time, there was a lot of tension between Simon and Erin, and between Erin and Simon\u2019s parents, Don and Gail.",

Source: Getty\n\nMillions of Aussies are in with a chance of winning $10,000 by simply recycling their household waste through the container deposit scheme in one state.\n\nIt will only take 50 drink containers and proof of transaction for Victorians to be entered into the 'Win a millions cents' competition, an incentive introduced by authorities to boost recycling efforts. From Monday, May 5, anyone who heads to a deposit site and returns 50 containers will be eligible to go in a draw to win one of the five $10,000 cash prizes, with one lucky winner even getting the chance to donate a further $10,000 to a charity of their choice.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nReturn at least 50 eligible containers in a single transaction. Keep the proof of transaction. Head to the website and complete the online entry form.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"All you need to do is go collect your containers and take them back to your local refund point. And then take a photo of your receipt or a screenshot if you use the app,\" Vic Return CEO Jim Round told 7News.\n\nEvery group of 50 containers equates to one entry into the prize draw, meaning Aussies can increase their chance of winning by recycling as many containers as possible in one transaction.\n\nThe competition ends June 15.\n\nVictoria's Environment Minister Steve Dimopoulos said the residents will be able to turn trash into cash and win \"a million cents\".\n\n\"Not only does it help the environment, it also helps the supply chain of raw materials,\" he said about the state's unique recycling campaign.\n\nPlastic containers can be deposited at any site in Victoria. Source: TOMRA\n\nAussie states grapple with recycling incentives\n\nThe chance to win $10,000 is one way that state governments are encouraging Aussies to do the right thing when it comes to their recycling. Container deposit schemes have been introduced across the country in recent years, allowing Aussies to collect 10 cents for every eligible plastic container they return. While the schemes have encouraged some to rummage through bins in search of eligible items, there are some advocates who have questioned whether the amount for a single plastic container is still enough of an incentive to enact real change in recycling behaviour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHeidi Taylor is the CEO of Tangaroa Blue, which has spent more than 20 years cataloguing plastic pollution that's washed up on Australian shores, and believes governments should consider increasing the financial return per bottle.\n\n\"We have seen a reduction in beverage containers [in the environment] due to these schemes,\u201d she told Yahoo News recently. \"You see it reduce a lot at the beginning of a campaign or scheme like this and then it dwindles a little bit.\n\n\"There's a lot of conversations going on right now about whether 10 cents is enough, and the answer to that is probably no. If you want people to see it as an incentive, you need to make it an incentive and 10 cents is not really that much in this day and age.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "It's proposed the national park could have many benefits for the state.\n\nA major Aussie city could soon get a new national park on its doorstep. Source: Google Maps & Victorian National Parks Association\n\nThere are renewed calls for authorities to open a new national park near a major Aussie city as the state's population booms and iconic wildlife continue to creep closer to extinction.\n\nAdvocates are pushing the Victorian state government to formally recognise the 350,000 acres of green space in the Central Highlands as the Great Forest National Park (GFNP), saying Melburnians are in desperate need of protected outdoor space where they can enjoy nature as the city continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country.\n\n\"We haven't had a new national park since the late 1990s in Melbourne, yet the city has increased in size equivalent to the size of Adelaide since then. We've had huge population growth and we've had advances in our hospitals and our schools and roads but had no investment in our green spaces,\" Sarah Rees, Project Manager of GFNP, told Yahoo News.\n\nAs the cost of living continues to bite and many Aussie families opt for holidays and experiences closer to home, having protected green space easily accessible by public transport is imperative for public health, she argued.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It's about an investment into Melbourne and into creating more green spaces for Victorians, particularly under a cost of living crisis where people can't afford their annual holidays and so forth,\" she said. \"The point is, everyone goes to these places to refuel, to spend that quiet time, to get away from the hustle and bustle. And the power of this place is you can reach it by public transport.\"\n\nMelbourne in need of more green space\n\nMelbourne is falling pitifully behind Sydney when it comes to the amount of green space available for residents to explore, Sarah said. Greater Sydney has 1.1 million hectares of green space, whereas Great Melbourne only has 165,000 hectares \u2014 meaning Sydney has seven times the amount.\n\nThe proposed national park covers 350,000 hectares. Source: Sarah Rees\n\n350,000 acres home to some of Australia's most endangered species\n\nSome of the country's most critically endangered species reside in the land where many hope the new national park will be and recognising it as a national park will help give the species a fighting chance at survival.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"This is an area that houses some of the most iconic yet critically endangered wildlife left in the state, and the mountain ash ecosystem itself is also critically endangered.\n\n\"So it's about a conservation investment,\" Sarah explained. An official national park declaration would protect the natural environment and its vast inhabitants.\n\nSpecies such as the baw baw frog, galaxias fish and leadbeater's possum \u2014 an emblem of Victoria \u2014 reside where the GFNP would be.\n\nThere were previously high volumes of logging activity in the area is and there are concerns the practice will be reintroduced if there is a change in political power in the state, so formally recognising the land as a national park will give assurance that is won't be logged.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "Experts fear the poor creature had been dangling for days before anyone noticed.\n\nThis corella is believed to have been entangled in fishing line for days above a lake in Bundoora. Source: Susane Teese\n\nWalkers strolling along a popular track were delighted to spot a corella, quietly perched on a branch above a lake. A day later, they were surprised to see the native bird in the same place, so they took a closer look and discovered something horrible \u2013 it was strung up on the branch with fishing line.\n\nWhile incidents like this are shocking to the public, they\u2019re an occurrence that wildlife rescuers see daily. Now, one Victorian-based animal rehabilitator is calling on the state government to help educate the next generation of anglers so they understand that when they cut snagged fishing line, there\u2019s a high chance it will entangle native birds and animals.\n\nBack in 2022, the government announced it would spend $1.5 million over four years to buy thousands of fishing rods for the state\u2019s children. To stop them making the same mistakes as previous generations, Boobook Wildlife Shelter founder Nelini Scarfe is calling for a further $1.5 million to be spent on education.\n\n\u201cFishing line is just a horror story for wildlife. It cuts into their legs and causes the most horrendous injuries. Sadly, nine times out of 10, when we have birds with fishing line entanglement, we have to euthanise them because it just does so much damage,\u201d Scarfe told Yahoo News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRelated: Anglers urged to clean up their lines and lures after horror find\n\nThe Metropolitan Fire Brigade were called out to assist with the rescue. Source: Susane Teese\n\nWhat happened to the entangled corella?\n\nOn average, Scarfe responds to one case of fishing line entanglement every week. But look on social media and you\u2019ll see other shelters around the country responding to the problem on a daily basis. Fishing lures and hooks attached to line are also a problem, as they\u2019re often swallowed by endangered sea turtles and pelicans.\n\nThe entangled corella was rescued on the weekend from above a lake at RMIT\u2019s Bundoora campus, 17km from Melbourne. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade assisted because rescuers were unable to reach it from a branch high above the lake.\n\nVolunteer rescuer Susane Teese was the first to assess the bird, and its grisly, emaciated condition has led her to believe it had been entangled in the fishing line for a long time. Tragically, the bird did not survive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen the corella was handed to me it was struggling and trying to bite me, which was a good sign because it\u2019s normal behaviour. But I must say it couldn\u2019t bite very hard,\u201d she told Yahoo.\n\n\u201cIt went down quickly after that. I think it died from organ failure because the poor bird had been struggling for days.\u201d\n\nA tawny frogmouth was discovered hanging from fishing line. Source: Susane Teese\n\nTawny frogmouths caught on fishing line\n\nLike Nelini, Susane frequently attends to wildlife entanglements. She's shared heartbreaking images of a tawny frogmouth that was discovered hanging from a tree branch by its wing.\n\n\"That one fortunately was called in quite quickly by a member of the public, we were able to get it down and it's actually been released,\" she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The interesting thing about the tawny frogmouth case was that when I was sitting in the car about to leave, a woman came up to me and said another one had been caught in the same spot, 12 months previously. It was from the same piece of fishing line.\n\n\"It's a dreadful pollutant. It's just saw awful for wildlife.\"\n\nAfter spending weeks in care, the tawny frogmouth was released. Source: Susane Teese\n\nFisheries authority encourages anglers to be responsible\n\nWhen fishing rods were handed out to children through the Little Angler Kits program, educational information about fishing was also supplied. This included a flyer for Fishcare Victoria, a not-for-profit funded by the government that promotes responsible fishing and care for aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThe Victorian Fisheries Authority told Yahoo News feedback about the program has been positive, and that it works to ensure kids know how to dispose of fishing line responsibly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Victorian Fisheries Authority provides information at fishing clinics, community events and through funding to organisations like Fishcare Victoria, to ensure young fishers are educated on how to do the right thing when disposing of fishing line,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe encourage all fishers to do the right thing and dispose of their line and any gear responsibly.\u201d\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
