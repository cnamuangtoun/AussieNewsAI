(AAP Image/Joel Carrett)\n\nIn a letter, the FSU warns that employers could be breaching workplace law if they continue to reject flexible work requests without proper consideration, consultation or justification.\n\nThe Fair Work Commission ruled Karlene Chandler had the right to work from home full time after Westpac failed in its obligations under the Fair Work Act.\n\nShe sought to work remotely from her home south of Sydney to enable her to carry out school drop-offs and pick-ups for her two young children.\ufeff\n\nThe bank's failures included not responding within 21 days, not engaging genuinely with Chandler's request and not providing her specific reasons for refusing it, the commission found.\n\nThe FSU says the ruling sets a precedent that will have far-reaching consequences across the finance sector.\n\nWorking from home has become increasingly popular since the pandemic. (Getty)\n\nIt claims many employers have sought to impose blanket return-to-office mandates without consideration for workers' personal circumstances.\n\nThe FSU has identified other examples of work-from-home arrangement by finance workers that have \ufeffbeen rejected by managers.\n\n\"Our members have proven they can deliver from home,\" said National Assistant Secretary Nicole McPherson.\n\n\"Flexibility is not a perk, it's a legal right and we'll keep fighting to make sure every worker in finance can exercise it.\"\n\nWestpac has been contacted for comment by 9news.com.au.\n\nHighest-paying jobs in Australia that don't need a degree View Gallery\n\nAustralian Bankers Association Simon Birmingham said working from home arrangements were best left to individual banks and their staff.\n\n\"Australian banks employ around 180,000 people in a wide variety of roles.\n\n\"Work from home has become a valued part of employment arrangements for banks and many of their employees but isn't possible in all circumstances all of the time.\n\n\"Flexible workplace arrangements are ideally matters for individual banks and their employees, who are best placed to together achieve outcomes that deliver the best for all parties.\"",

    "text": "When theatre-maker and artist Lamine Sonko moved to Australia 20 years ago, he carried more than a suitcase \u2014 he carried a rite.\n\nBorn into a lineage where the guewel is a custodian of sacred knowledge, Sonko's initiation into the role became the starting point for his latest work, which invites audiences to witness how culture is kept, shared and felt.\n\nGuewel is not just a show; it's a living transmission of West African cosmology, anchored in rhythm, song and ritual, now unfolding on the Australian stage.\n\n\"I hold on to the parts of my culture that I said goodbye to in West Africa; that's what I brought here with me,\" Sonko tells ABC Arts.\n\nLamine Sonko says his form of artwork was not understood in Australia when he arrived. (Supplied: Damien Vincenzi)\n\nThis highly anticipated offering, which took seven years to develop, holds the audience's hand while walking them through a theatrical experience that demonstrates why African storytelling invites an embodied audience experience.\n\n\"Sacred knowledge is embedded in rhythm, songs we sing and movements we untie to activate interconnectedness between each other and the nature we inhabit\" Sonko says.\n\nA cultural convergence\n\nGuewel is Sonko's directorial debut.\n\nAt just 19, he was already a seasoned theatre practitioner having toured France and Switzerland for five years with the National Theatre of Senegal.\n\n\"When I arrived in Australia 20 years ago, I quickly learned that there were virtually no opportunities for African theatre-makers,\" he says.\n\nLoading...\n\nDespite his experience, Sonko says his types of artistic skills were not broadly recognised by the Australian creative industry.\n\n\" I had to make sad adjustments. \"\n\nAt one point he says he was forced to make a temporary shift to teaching drumming to sustain himself financially.\n\nSonko says he faced the challenge of navigating a new cultural landscape while remaining true to his roots, with Guewel creating connections between the traditional arts of Senegal and contemporary practices in Australia.\n\nFrom backstage to on stage\n\nSonko grew up wandering the National Theatre of Senegal's corridors and stages.\n\nThere, his mother, Oumy Sene, was a celebrated dancer and cultural leader, while his father, Bouly Sonko, directed the theatre for more than two decades.\n\nChildhood memories are inseparable from significant works within the theatre's lineage; for example, his father's Pangols \u2014 lauded by The New York Times as an exploration of \"the spiritual nature of all living things\" \u2014 left an imprint that would echo in Sonko's own explorations of cosmology and ritual form.\n\nLamine Sonko's family is theatre royalty in Senegal. (Supplied: Olive Moynihan)\n\nBefore Sonko's artistic interest was sparked by his involvement with the National Ballet of Senegal, where he learned the intricate dance forms and storytelling techniques that characterise Senegalese culture, he was ushered into this space at the tender age of seven as a guewel.\n\nHe underwent a cultural initiation to become a custodian of sacred knowledge who is responsible for preserving and sharing the narratives of his people through songs, dance and stories.\n\nHe says they will forever inform his work and the way he reads the world.\n\n\"Those songs, dances and stories become a narrative that follows me until the end of my time in this universe,\" he says.\n\nEverything is connected\n\nIn Guewel, Sonko activates the audience's curiosity by asking them to relearn their place among trees, stars,and deities through rhythm, performance and ancestral dialogue.\n\nSonko reframes cosmology \u2014 a branch of physics and metaphysics dealing with the nature of the universe, the cosmos \u2014 as Senegalese cosmovision: a holistic system teaching the interconnectedness of everything from the soil to the stars.\n\nIn Guewel, this cosmology materialises as a multi-sensory encounter: masks invoke the unseen world, rhythms carry sacred patterns and choreography dramatises the interdependence of humans, nature and ancestors.\n\nAwa Coulibaly brings Senegalese cosmology to life in Guewel. (Supplied: Olive Moynihan)\n\nThe show presents Africa's story beyond entertainment spanning music, drumming and dancing.\n\nIt invites audiences to witness a culture that threads the cosmos through daily life and performance, expanding the Australian stage with a future-forward vision that is at once rooted, communal and star-bound.\n\nThe show features ceremonial costumes and masks of intricate shapes paired with both traditional and contemporary music, dance, projection and animation.\n\nLive musicians weave ancestral rhythms with progressive elements, while dancers move through ritual gestures and contemporary steps.\n\nProjections and animation enhance the stage, creating shifting landscapes that interact with the performers and amplify the storytelling.\n\nThe result is an immersive, embodied experience where breath, weight and momentum are visible, inviting spectators to feel the narrative as it unfolds.\n\nGuewel performs at the Arts House in Melbourne from November 12-16.",

I'll have a really good bowl in Perth, and by then I'll know where I'm at.\"\n\nWhat will not be so easy, Cummins concedes, is playing every remaining Test this summer once he does return.\n\nThere is an eight-day gap built in between the second and third Tests, but only four-day gaps between the third, fourth and fifth Tests.\n\nAustralian officials have already identified that as a pressure point of the summer for bowlers, particularly if Tests go the distance and the hosts spend long periods in the field.\n\n\"I'm pretty keen to play as much as I can,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"But realistically, if we have a big game and bowl 40 or 50 overs and then there's a game that starts a few days later, it might be a bridge too far.\n\n\"I'm trying to get right, and if I get right, then hopefully I'll try to play most of it as I can.\"\n\nCummins said he did not feel he would need a warm-up match during a tour game or grade-cricket fixture to have his body right for Test cricket.\n\nInstead, Australia's pace leader will fly to Perth with the rest of the team next week and spend the Test with coaching staff.\n\n\"Before the 2023 ODI World Cup, I flew over to South Africa and watched the last couple of ODIs there,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"It was actually a really different view from the coach's box. It's a different perspective.\n\n\"So hopefully I gather some information from being in that position through the Test that later on in the series I can use.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"Or maybe Steve Smith needs something and I have seen something differently from up there.\n\n\"But being close to the game and the conversations, I think I will need that going into the second or third Test.\"\n\nMitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood will lead the pace attack in Cummins's absence, with Scott Boland to keep his spot after taking a hat-trick in Australia's previous Test in the West Indies.\n\nAustralia is hoping all-rounder Cameron Green can bowl up to 20 overs in his next Sheffield Shield match, with Beau Webster a chance to stay on as a second all-rounder.\n\nAAP",

I was with my masseuse and physio last night and something really has changed with my knee.\n\n\"Like it's not swelling. It's not feeling bad after a session.\"\n\nNick Kyrgios has struggled with knee and wrist injuries in the past three years. (Getty Images: TPN/Frey)\n\nBuilding momentum\n\nRestricted to just six matches in the past three years after four rounds of knee and wrist surgery, Kyrgios is ranked number 652 in the world having spiralled outside the top 1,000 at one point.\n\nBut the one-time world number 13 will play a series of exhibition matches next month against Ben Shelton in Atlanta, Tommy Paul at Madison Square Garden, the World Team Tennis in India and Sabalenka in Dubai on December 28 to gauge his fitness.\n\n\"Then if I get through all of that, I'm ready to go,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"I don't know whether to call it a miracle or anything, but my knee feels like it's gotten younger by a couple of years.\"\n\nKyrgios had no idea why his knee had suddenly come good, but said he was finally free in his movement again.\n\n\"I felt like something was almost like stuck or something was just a bit odd and then now, especially the last week and a half or two weeks, I'm back moving and sliding the way I was moving in 2022,\" he said.\n\n\"So something in my knee is just, you know I don't want to to jinx it, but something in it has gone, kind of allowed me to put three, four days of training together on court for an hour and a half, two hours and be able to actually recover and then build on that.\n\n\"So that's it's been really exciting and I haven't really told anyone. I have a new lease on life on court.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm in a really good space at the moment and, physically, I've been putting in the work.\"\n\nNick Kyrgios will be hoping for a smooth run of results. (Getty Images: Anychance/Simon Bruty)\n\nAustralian Open ambition\n\nThe 30-year-old would require a wildcard from Tennis Australia to gain entry to his home grand slam, but that would seem a given.\n\n\"Look, it's all very raw at the moment, but I literally told my agents yesterday there's a chance that I would love to play Brisbane again in singles [too],\" he said.\n\nIf he did return, Kyrgios would do so with modest expectations.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\n\"There's no f***ing like, 'Oh, I'm gonna win this tournament'. Because after the last couple of months, I lost complete hope,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought my tennis career was literally coming to doubles, whatever, but I thought that that chapter was closing, where now I'm just optimistic again.\"\n\nAlso reporting that his serving \"wrist is amazing now\" too, Kyrgios said it was too early to say if he would ever go deep at another grand slam.\n\n\"I mean, I'm optimistic with the way the way I'm feeling,\" he said.\n\n\"I genuinely feel like I could at least give myself the chance to get there because of the training.\n\n\"That was the issue. I wasn't even able to train and build and even stack days together.\n\n\"It was like knee swelling, ice, rest, let's get back on court, let's do the basics.\n\n\"Where now it's like, 'OK, I can work on my forehand, I can work on match play, I can work on my returns'.\n\n\"I'm actually working on my game rather than my body.

    "text": "Microsoft has apologised to customers and said it will refund them, after the consumer watchdog alleged the tech giant misled about 2.7 million Australians over subscription costs so they would remain on more expensive plans.\n\nThe company wrote to customers on Thursday to apologise to those affected, saying it \"fell short of our standards\" and could have \"communicated more clearly when we changed our pricing in October 2024\".\n\nLast week, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sued the tech giant for allegedly misleading Australians over its Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\n\n\"In response to the demand for advanced AI tools, we introduced AI capabilities into the Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions that we offer in Australia,\" the company said on Thursday.\n\n\"In hindsight, we could have been clearer about the availability of a non-AI enabled offering with subscribers, not just to those who opted to cancel their subscription.\n\n\"In our email to subscribers, we expressed our regret for not being clearer about our subscription options, shared details about lower-priced alternatives that come without AI and offered a refund to eligible subscribers who wish to switch.\"\n\nAnnouncing the court action last week, the consumer watchdog slammed Microsoft for the conduct, alleging it \"deliberately hid\" a subscription option from Australian customers and said it would be seeking a penalty that would deter similar behaviour from other firms.\n\nThe tech giant faced backlash from customers who did not want to pay for Copilot. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic/Illustration)\n\nCustomers have two options: to stay on the Microsoft plan with Copilot features at the increased price, or to switch back to the \"Classic\" plan, which the company says \"does not include our AI assistant Copilot and may not receive new feature updates\".\n\nMicrosoft said subscribers who opted to switch back to the cheaper plans before the end of 2025 would, within 30 days, receive refunds dating back to payments made after November 30, 2024.\n\nLoading...\n\nHow the ACCC alleges Microsoft misled customers\n\nFollowing the integration of Microsoft's AI feature, Copilot, the company increased the annual subscription price of its Microsoft 365 personal plan by 45 per cent from $109 to $159.\n\nThe annual subscription price for the Microsoft 365 family plan increased by 29 per cent from $139 to $179.\n\nThe ACCC alleged that since October 31, 2024, Microsoft had told these subscribers with auto-renewal enabled that to maintain their subscription, they \"must accept the integration of Copilot and pay higher prices for their plan, or, alternatively, cancel their subscription\".\n\nThis information was false or misleading, the ACCC alleges, because there was \"an undisclosed third option\" \u2014 the Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Classic plans \u2014 which allowed subscribers to retain the features of their existing plan, without Copilot, at the previous lower price.\n\nMicrosoft has come under fire for hiking its subscription prices. (AP)\n\nMicrosoft sent two emails and published a blog post to inform auto-renewing subscribers \u2014 as of October 31, 2024 \u2014 about the Copilot integration and the impending price increase that would apply at their next renewal.\n\nThe ACCC's case against Microsoft centres around those three pieces of communication the company had with its customers.\n\n\"We allege that Microsoft's two emails to existing subscribers and the blog post were false or misleading as they conveyed that consumers had to accept the more expensive Copilot-integrated plans, and that the only other option was to cancel,\" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said when announcing the legal action on October 27.\n\n\"All businesses need to provide accurate information about their services and prices. Failure to do so risks breaching the Australian consumer law.\"\n\nIn its message to customers on Thursday, Microsoft said it did not act in a trustworthy and transparent manner.\n\n\"We have been present in Australia for more than 40 years, operating on the principles of trust and transparency. We fell short of our standards here, and we apologise. We will learn from this and improve,\" the company said.\n\nThe US-based tech giant could face multi-million-dollar penalties if the court finds in the ACCC's favour.",

    "text": "For the first time in 16 Formula 1 weekends, Oscar Piastri enters an F1 round not as the drivers' championship leader.\n\nThe Australian enters this weekend's racing in Brazil one point behind his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris.\n\nMeanwhile, Red Bull's Max Verstappen continues to lurk, 36 points behind Norris in a comeback that has been worthy of any champion.\n\nThere are four rounds left of this epic championship season, with a genuine three-way battle for the drivers' championship.\n\nHere is how to follow this weekend's F1 action through ABC Sport, including the Formula 1 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix live blog on Monday, November 9.\n\n'Proud' Piastri is now the hunter as Norris leads the championship\n\nPiastri was the leader of the drivers' championship from the end of round five in Saudi Arabia until round 20's grand prix in Mexico.\n\nBut now, the Australian is second in the championship, one point behind his McLaren teammate Norris.\n\nNorris has 357 points, Piastri has 356, and Verstappen remains in the hunt with 321 points.\n\nPiastri's loses lead, but there is hope in his title bid Oscar Piastri has lost his lead in the Formula 1 drivers' championship. Despite momentum working against the Australian, there are still plenty of reasons to believe he can win the world title.\n\nPiastri won seven of the first 15 grands prix this season, but has not been on the top step in the previous five rounds.\n\nThe Australian finished on the podium in 14 of the opening 16 grands prix, but has failed to place in the top three in the next four.\n\nThe dip in form has eradicated what was a 34-point lead to Norris after round 15 in the Netherlands, Piastri's last win.\n\nHowever, Piastri's fifth-place effort at the Mexican Grand Prix was arguably one of his better drives this season.\n\nPiastri had not looked comfortable in his McLaren that weekend, compared to Norris, who was a class above the field and took victory.\n\nBut the Australian improved throughout the race, and on a track that can be difficult to overtake on, climbed from ninth after the first lap to finish in the top five.\n\nCircuits with low grip, like in Mexico, appear not to suit Piastri's style of driving. But McLaren's team principal Andrea Stella said after the race two weeks ago that Piastri was able to adapt in those conditions and improve as the weekend went on.\n\nF1 driver says he 'could have killed' marshals after shocking near miss A camera captures the terrifying moment two track marshals run in front of Liam Lawson's car during Formula 1's Mexico City Grand Prix.\n\nWhile acknowledging it was a tough weekend for the Australian, Stella said it was an important learning experience as Piastri enters the final four rounds of the championship.\n\n\"It's important for Oscar that we go through this kind of experience in which we learn new tools to add to the toolbox, because that's how you become the most complete version of a Formula 1 driver,\" Stella said after the Mexico City Grand Prix.\n\n\"And this is also important for the next four races in which we're going to find, again, different conditions.\n\n\"So, we need to be ready for all of them. But I think Oscar should be very proud and happy with this race.\"\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo track is traditionally high-grip, requiring a car to have plenty of downforce. In theory, this should be better for Piastri, who won in the Netherlands on a track that also requires high downforce.\n\nWhen does the F1 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix begin?\n\nIn Australia, the Formula 1 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix will be held on Monday, November 10.\n\nHere is when the race will begin in each of Australia's states and territories:\n\n4am AEDT: NSW, ACT, Vic, Tas\n\n3:30am ACDT: South Australia\n\n3am AEST: Queensland\n\n2:30am ACST: Northern Territory\n\n1am AWST: Western Australia\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

    "text": "Kangaroos coach Kevin Walters has resisted the temptation to blood his unused squad members by naming a strong side for the third and final Ashes Test in Leeds.\n\nSkipper Isaah Yeo returns to lead the side as Australia looks to complete a clean sweep over England.\n\nAfter Australia opened up their unassailable 2-0 lead with the 14-4 win at Everton last weekend, Walters had mused aloud about the prospect of giving a \"reward\" to fringe members of the squad by throwing them into the final Test at Headingley on Saturday (Sunday AEDT).\n\nAustralia team for third Ashes Test 1.

Bradman Best.\n\nInstead, despite plenty of calls for him to use the \"dead rubber\" as a chance to field new Kangaroos with an eye on next year's World Cup, he has put out what he considers Australia's best 17 to go and finish the job ruthlessly.\n\n\"We've had to work exceptionally hard in challenging conditions to win the opening two Tests, and while we'd like to reward the extended squad for their outstanding efforts on tour, we just feel that the players who have got the job done deserve to play in Leeds,\" Walters said.\n\n\"The playing group has had a few days off to freshen up and now it's back to work \u2014 we've trained well today and we've still got the captain's run to get ourselves where we need to be for what is a very important Test match for both sides.\"\n\nHarry Grant led Australia in the second Test in the absence of Isaah Yeo. (Getty Images: Michael Steele)\n\nPanthers lock Yeo is the only change to the second-Test team that had to slog hard to overcome England in Liverpool.\n\nThe 30-year-old Panthers star got just a few minutes of action in the first-Test 26-6 win at Wembley before a head-knock with Dom Young sidelined him.\n\nBut Yeo has been welcomed back to lead the side after undergoing all the necessary NRL concussion protocols, with second-Test stand-in Harry Grant handing back the armband.\n\nYeo comes in for his clubmate Lindsay Smith, who will now move back to the extended squad for the final Test.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\nWalters's choice may not have gone down too well with those pundits who felt this would have been the perfect chance to experiment with the Ashes wrapped up for the 14th consecutive time.\n\nInstead, the tour stands to be completed without six of the 24-strong touring squad seeing a minute's action \u2014 Bradman, Ethan Strange, Blayke Brailey and Jacob Preston, who remain uncapped, as well as the more experienced Dylan Edwards and Mitch Moses.\n\nGehamat Shibasaki, who had not had the most impactful series, had seemed vulnerable to being replaced by Best, but the Newcastle centre remains as 18th man.\n\nAnother inaugural accolade to be settled on Saturday will be the player-of-the-series award, which has been re-named the Fulton-Reilly award, after two Ashes icons, the Kangaroos' Bob Fulton and England's Malcolm Reilly.\n\nFavourites for the honour include Reece Walsh and Cameron Munster, who won the man-of-the-match awards in the first two Tests, as well as the exceptional Angus Crichton and Harry Grant.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "US oil production has increased, from the record average of 13.3 million barrels a day last year under the Biden administration to what the International Energy Agency predicts will be an average of 13.5 million barrels a day this year, but the slump in oil prices is likely to result in a sharp fall in drilling activity next year. Is the US experiencing \u201cthe most successful economy in the history of our country,\u201d as Trump claimed? If the sharemarket were any guide, the answer would be an unequivocal \u201cyes\u201d. It\u2019s up 17.5 per cent since last year\u2019s election, albeit that it is being driven by the boom in artificial intelligence rather than the economy\u2019s wider settings. Those with an exposure to the market, which tends to be the wealthier households, certainly see the Trump presidency as a success. They were also the major beneficiaries of the big tax cuts in Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d that has since been rebranded, for obvious political reasons, as the \u201cWorking Families Tax Cut Bill\u201d.\n\nThe wealthy (the Trump family in particular) have also benefited from the massive surge in the value of crypto assets that has occurred since Trump embraced an asset class he once derided and which the Biden administration viewed with suspicion and cynicism. In the real economy, and for the less wealthy and poor US households, things aren\u2019t quite as buoyant. The US economy grew at 2.4 per cent last year. Trump\u2019s \u201cgreatest economy\u201d, one he repeatedly claims is the envy of the world, and which he said on Wednesday is seeing \u201cthe American Dream surging back to life\u201d, will grow, according to the International Monetary Fund, 2 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2026. US consumers don\u2019t appear to believe that Trump is making America affordable again, with his approval rating dropping from 47 per cent early this year to 37 per cent in recent polling. Credit: Getty Images The now-record government shutdown will shave up to a percentage point off the December quarter GDP, although much of that should be recovered once the government re-opens and its furloughed employees are paid again.\n\nUS government debt was $US36.1 trillion at the end of last year. It\u2019s now above $US38 trillion and rising. Despite Elon Musk and DOGE taking a chainsaw to the US bureaucracy and more than 100,000 federal government employees sacked, the budget deficit forecast by the Congressional Budget Office of $US1.8 trillion this year will only be marginally smaller than last year\u2019s $US1.83 trillion, despite Trump hacking into the massive spending Biden was making in green energy and advanced manufacturing. Loading There\u2019s been a lot of talk this year about the \u201cdebasement trade\u201d, or investors selling US dollar-denominated assets because they are worried that, to escape its debt trap, the US will allow inflation and money-printing or more extreme measures that will erode the value of the dollar and the real value of their investments. The US dollar, while it has bounced back from its September lows, has fallen about 5 per cent against the basket of America\u2019s major trading partners\u2019 currencies. It had fallen more than 10 per cent before the US Federal Reserve Board\u2019s first rate cut this year in September.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s campaign, Trump said that, if he were elected, the dollar would be \u201cso secure\u201d. \u201cYour reserve currency will be the strongest it\u2019ll ever be,\u201d he said. Hmm. US interest rates have, of course, fallen, with the yield on the 10-year bond rate down from 4.27 per cent at the end of last year to about 4.15 per cent and the yields on shorter-duration Treasuries by even more. He\u2019s now got less than a year to turn his claims of overseeing the greatest economy ever into something real. That\u2019s a function, however, of the weakening of economic growth, reflected in an unemployment rate that has begun edging up from 4.1 per cent in the December quarter last year to 4.3 per cent in the most recent available data.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s beloved tariff regime holds up against legal challenges \u2013 the arguments before the Supreme Court justices who\u2019ve previously been very supportive of Trump\u2019s agenda on Wednesday don\u2019t appear to have gone well for the administration \u2013 it will continue to undermine growth and fuel inflation. According to Goldman Sachs, about 55 per cent of the costs of the tariffs will, by the end of the year, be borne by US consumers and 22 per cent by US companies, with foreign exports absorbing 18 per cent. Goldman expects consumers could pay up to 70 per cent of their cost by the end of next year, underscoring that \u2013 contrary to what Trump and his advisers constantly claim \u2013 it is US consumers, and US companies, that pay the overwhelming majority of the tariffs\u2019 cost. Trump promised to \u201ctariff the hell out of countries that have been taking advantage of us\u201d. He\u2019s kept that promise, but he failed to tell voters (or perhaps he didn\u2019t understand) that it meant introducing a big new and highly regressive domestic tax on consumption. In those trade deals, and from some arm-twisting of US companies, Trump has obtained promises of massive investments in the US. The White House claims they total $US8.9 trillion, although that would include previously planned expenditures and probably some that will never be made once (if?) Trump departs the White House.\n\nEven a decent slice of those commitments would, however, help build manufacturing investment and jobs in the US, which, given that the US manufacturing sector has, according to the ISM Manufacturing PMI, been shrinking for eight months straight, is much needed. Manufacturing investment and jobs grew strongly during Biden\u2019s term. Loading Trump has over-delivered on his promises to deal with illegal immigration, even if the brutal measures taken by ICE to execute the policies appear increasingly unpopular. He\u2019s also had some foreign policy wins. However, it\u2019s the domestic economy and policies that impact Americans\u2019 costs-of-living that produced the election outcomes this week and that will decide the shape of Congress \u2013 and the effectiveness of the last two years of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 at next year\u2019s mid-terms. He\u2019s now got less than a year to turn his claims of overseeing the greatest economy ever into something real.",

    "text": "Key Points Zohran Mamdani's victory to become the next mayor of New York City could invigorate the national Democratic movement, experts say.\n\nThe Democrats also saw victories in other elections this week in left-leaning states.\n\nThe winning streak could be the momentum the Democrats need as they prepare for next November's midterm election.\n\nZohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old mayor-elect of New York City, has received a groundswell of support in the United States and overseas for his socialist-democratic platform and energising personality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMamdani has made history as the first Muslim and person of South Asian descent to be elected as the city's mayor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis victory follows a series of political wins for the Democratic Party, with key elections in the United States just one year away.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut experts have told SBS News that while his popularity could help boost the polls in the Democrats' favour, they have work to do to repair their image on a national level.\n\n\n\nWhy is Zohran Mamdani so popular?\n\nMark Rolfe, a lecturer in the school of social sciences at the University of NSW, told SBS News that Mamdani's election has been unusually popular around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think the election of the mayor of Sydney would evoke such international interest,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But looking around America, Australia and Britain, you've got this constant theme of what is going to happen to our young generations, and we've got all these old farts in charge who seem out of touch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's understandable that Mamdani's youth and focus on affordability evoke such interest.\"\n\n\n\nRolfe said that Mamdani's policies, such as freezing rents on certain properties and free childcare, would put him as a mainstream left candidate in other political spectrums, including Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmeisha Cross, a Democratic Party strategist and former adviser to Barack Obama, told ABC Radio National that Mamdani's focus on affordability won him his landslide victory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now York has one of the largest economies in the world, and it's also a city where people have been crying out about affordability, not being able to pay rent, not being able to afford groceries,\" she said on Thursday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He spoke to those issues and made that the central point of his campaign.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe likened his campaign to that of US President Donald Trump's run to victory in 2016, saying that despite being on different sides of the political spectrum, they appealed to voters for similar reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They wanted somebody who was seen as an outsider, somebody who didn't have any elongated political past. They wanted somebody who spoke about change and brought about something different,\" she said.\n\n\n\nDemocrats win in other states\n\nBesides Mamdani's win, in Virginia and New Jersey, moderate Democrats Abigail Spanberger, and Mikie Sherrill, won the elections for governor with commanding leads.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth candidates had sought to tie their opponents to Trump in an effort to harness frustration among Democratic and independent voters over his chaotic tenure.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Can Zohran Mamdani deliver on his election promises? SBS News 05:14 English\n\nMore than one-third of voters in those states said opposing Trump was a factor in their vote, according to exit polls conducted for a consortium of US networks and the Associated Press. Those voters overwhelmingly cast ballots for the Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest practical boost to Democrats on Tuesday came out of California, where voters gave Democratic politicians the power to redraw the state's congressional map, expanding a national battle over redistricting that will shape the race for the US House of Representatives.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump reacts to Mamdani win\n\nTrump said that Mamdani's victory was expected and he did not think it was good for Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not sure it was good for anybody, but we had an interesting evening, and we learned a lot,\" he told officials in the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social network, he cited anonymous \"pollsters\" suggesting the Republican defeats were due to the government shutdown and the fact that his own name wasn't on the ballots.\n\n\n\nUS vice president JD Vance said on Wednesday it was \"idiotic to overreact to a couple of elections\" in states that lean Democratic. He nonetheless suggested Republicans laser in on the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to focus on the home front,\" he wrote on X. \"We're going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that's the metric by which we'll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.\"\n\n\n\nDemocrats seen as 'out of touch'\n\nRolfe said these victories were to be expected, and that the Democrats have to \"sort out what they stand for\" if they want to keep the momentum going ahead of next year's midterm elections, and the 2028 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2026 midterm election will primarily take place next November, when all the seats in the US House of Representatives will be contested.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the parties of the current president tend to lose seats at these elections, Rolfe said an \"anti-Trump\" protest vote is not a sure thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe flagged that opinion polling in the US shows that people see the Democrats as more \"out of touch\" than Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got the problem for the Democrats as a whole of trying to knit together a message for the midterms next year, where they have to appeal to constituencies across America,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe said the Democrats have \"compounded their problems of what they stand for\" during and since Trump's first presidency, saying they will need a unifying platform if they want to keep winning elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Democrats have a real problem if they're just relying on next year as an anti-Trump protest,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross said that the Democratic Party needs to listen to voter concerns about affordability and the cost of living and prioritise elevating people to the middle class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't have to have multimillion-dollar consultants to tell you what the people are saying,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Right now, far too many Americans are feeling as though this country has left them behind.\"\n\n\n\nCross said that both the Democrats and Republicans have to focus on appealing to their core supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican strategist John Feehery said Trump needs to be more concerned with his domestic presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The problem with Trump is he's trying to save the world, but he's forgetting about the people who brought him here, and they're not doing that great\", Reuters reported on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He needs less running around and more focus on what the political problems are at home.\"\n\n\n\n",

The report recommended Australia should establish a permanent CDC as a priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Australia fared better than other countries in terms of mortality rate from COVID-19 and its economic recovery, the pandemic response took a severe toll on the nation.\n\n\n\n\"People worked beyond normal limits, and many of the public health professionals, frontline community service and health staff, political leaders, health experts and public servants we relied on to get through the pandemic are no longer in their positions,\" the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This poses risks to our resilience to face another crisis.\"\n\n\n\nWhat will the CDC do?\n\nThe Australian CDC said it is growing in a \"phased approach\" and has been initially focusing on preparing for public health emergencies, improving the national public health surveillance system, as well as building capability across health security and the links between the health of human health, animal health and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first priorities for the agency from January will be \"communicable diseases, pandemic preparedness and capabilities in environmental health and occupational health and respiratory diseases\", McAllister said. However, she said the centre could expand into areas such as chronic diseases following an independent review in 2028.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Infant peanut feeding prevented thousands of children from developing allergies\n\nWhile she said the agency is essential, independent MP Dr Monique Ryan has criticised the bill establishing the centre for failing to immediately address chronic illnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nine out of 10 deaths in Australia are related to chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease but the CDC that we're proposing to set up right now won't deal with those until after 2028 at best,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffin said that while the agency is in its earliest days, it is reasonable that chronic illnesses may not be included from the outset but said they will need to be incorporated into the agency's operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think integrating the management of chronic disease given its role in risk for infectious diseases and its impact on the population more broadly would be really important.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Recently-tightened sanctions on Russian oil could drive prices up and continue to shake global markets, experts say, which could lead to Australian drivers paying more for fuel and have a flow-on effect of increasing goods prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's inflation has risen again , up 1.3 per cent in the September quarter and 3.2 per cent over the year \u2014 the first increase in underlying inflation since late 2022, when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent global fuel prices soaring.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, three-and-a-half years later, a new round of US and EU-led sanctions aims to further limit Russia's ability to finance its war in Ukraine, which has killed over 14,000 Ukrainian civilians and injured more than 37,000, according to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince February 2022, at least 621 Russian civilians, including 38 children, have been killed and 3,217 wounded in Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, according to Russia's Investigative Committee chief Alexander Bastrykin, as quoted in a May 2025 Moscow Times report.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO New US, EU sanctions aim to pressure Russia towards ceasefire SBS News 05:04 English\n\nDespite diplomatic efforts to forge a ceasefire, the war continues . In response, the EU, UK and US have progressively expanded sanctions since 2022, tightening controls on Russian transport, insurance and refinery products.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent sanctions specifically target Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, which together account for more than 5 per cent of global oil output.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to UK government estimates, global sanctions have cost the Russian state at least $687.8 billion since February 2022 \u2014 roughly a quarter of Russia's annual GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, given Russia's position in the global oil market, such measures may also come at a cost to the West.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Vladimir Putin says Russia will not bow to the pressure of US sanctions on oil giants\n\nAlthough sanctions on Russia are only one factor shaping global oil prices, higher power and transport costs remain key drivers of inflation in Australia, and rising oil prices can amplify both.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach new round of sanctions influences supply dynamics and trade flows, often in a disruptive way.\n\n\n\n\n\nOil market analysts differ on how these measures could ripple through to Australia \u2014 some argue the impact will be minimal, while others caution it could be more pronounced. The design and scope of any future Australian sanctions policies may also add another layer of influence.\n\n\n\nRipple effects travel fast\n\nAustralia doesn't buy oil directly from Russia, and has imposed sanctions on the import of Russian crude since February 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the Australian government also moved to sanction a fleet of 150 Russian oil tankers \u2014 dubbed the 'shadow fleet' \u2014 which had been enabling the import of oil products refined from Russian crude to Australia via third countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SBS News investigation last month revealed how these sanctioned tankers are still infiltrating the supply chains of Australian companies.\n\n\n\nHowever, given Russia's position as the world's second-largest oil exporter, sanctions can also affect quick-moving global benchmarks \u2014 and those shifts often reach local pumps within weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia, says the new sanctions have already started reshaping trade flows in Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China's state oil companies have reportedly suspended seaborne purchases of Russian oil, and Indian refiners are reassessing their imports,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We may now be at a turning point, where higher oil prices could begin to flow through to Australian motorists over the next few weeks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark that sets the price for most fuel imported into the Asia-Pacific, rose from about US $55 a barrel in September to around US $65.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Generally, a $1 change in crude translates to about a 1-cent change at the pump,\" Sycamore says.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS Russian, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) confirmed that retail fuel prices are \"largely determined by movements in international benchmark refined-fuel prices (which are driven by international crude-oil prices) and the AUD-USD exchange rate\".\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in these benchmarks, the ACCC adds, usually take about two weeks to filter through to major cities, and longer in regional areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nOil prices often rise and fall in response to geopolitical flare-ups, and Sycamore says recent events have shown how quickly those swings can reverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Back in June, there were concerns that the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran would push oil above US$100. It peaked around $78, then dropped again once that conflict ended.\"\n\n\n\nSome observers expect any price increases of recently tightened sanctions to be short-lived.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking with reporters on the sidelines of Singapore International Energy Week, International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol said that while sanctions could temporarily lift oil prices, the effect would likely be limited due to surplus capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The oil and gas markets will enter a very distinct period, which is in the absence of major geopolitical tensions, we are going to see lower oil and gas prices,\" Birol told Reuters.\n\n\n\nPotential impacts on diesel\n\nHowever, not all shocks fade as fast.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Institute of Petroleum, average retail diesel prices in Australia hit record highs after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2014 surging to $2.34 a litre in June 2022, up from lows of around $1.20 in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrices have remained elevated since, hovering between $1.80 and $2 a litre through 2023 to 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiesel powers Australia's trucks, farms and freight \u2014 forming the backbone of transport, mining and agriculture.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen its price rises, it pushes up the cost of moving goods, growing food and running equipment, meaning consumers often feel impacts far beyond the pump.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also where global oil shocks are most sharply felt in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith recent sanctions and attacks targeting Russian oil refining infrastructure \u2014 and which have prompted retaliatory attacks on Ukrainian energy production sites and distribution facilities \u2014 analysts warn that market volatility could intensify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The scope for Ukraine to ratchet up its attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, or stricter sanctions on Russian crude exports, could lead to a more significant market disruption and higher prices at the pump,\" says Saul Kavonic, Head of Energy Research at MST Marquee.\n\n\n\nSanctions models matter\n\nAlthough Australia's direct exposure to Russian oil is limited, some experts say the new sanctions model could impact supply and push prices slightly higher if it follows the EU's policy of banning imports from countries that are 'net importers' of crude oil.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaibhav Raghunandan is an EU-Russia analyst with the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and says: \"If Australia's policy follows this route, it will probably lead to a rise in prices mainly because it will constrict imports from many 'net importer' countries sourcing Russian crude in Asia \u2014 and which supply Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our analysis is based on Australia's relatively low reliance on refineries processing Russian crude \u2014 around 12 per cent of diesel imports in 2024,\" he says, adding that the impact of sanctions will depend largely on policy design.\n\n\n\nRaghunandan says if Australian sanctions were to focus on refineries in third countries, instead of targeting net importers as the EU has done, that may be a more effective strategy and is likely to have \"little to no inflationary effect\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even within net importer countries, there remain refineries which do not process Russian crude and supply to Australia,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Australia has so far made no announcements signalling an intention to adopt an EU-style ban on imports of products refined from Russian crude via third countries.\n\n\n\nHow global prices flow to Australian pumps\n\nAccording to the Australia Institute, about 91 per cent of Australia's fuel consumption is met by imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat reliance is compounded by limited domestic storage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs The Australian Financial Review reported this month, referring to the government data, the country had oil stores equivalent to 49 days' worth of net imports, which is far below the 90-day requirement under the International Energy Agency treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) reported that in July, Australia held just 20 days of jet fuel, 24 days of diesel and 28 days of petrol.\n\n\n\nMost of Australia's refined fuel imports come from Singapore, South Korea and Japan, with smaller volumes from India and Malaysia, according to DCCEEW statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, Australian fuel prices are largely driven by the Singapore benchmark \u2014 a daily regional price guide published by S&P Global Commodity Insights, also known as Platts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen oil prices, refinery costs, or shipping rates rise in Singapore, those increases flow directly through to Australian wholesalers and, within about two weeks, to drivers at the pump.\n\n\n\n\n\nS&P Global's head of oil markets and downstream research Premasish Das says sanctions on Russian oil usually redirect trade rather than reduce it, but notes that rerouting drives up freight and insurance costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The EU sanctions on fuels produced from Russian oil could potentially displace more than 300,000 barrels a day of diesel shipments to the EU from India and T\u00fcrkiye,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This shift could fragment the diesel trade and clean-tanker markets, making them more expensive \u2026 Given Australia's reliance on imports, this will likely lead to increased fuel prices as well.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Trump touts Asia triumph - and a third term, Russia's oil sanctions & 'et tu' Queensland? SBS News 32:14 English\n\nRefiners and traders also use similar data from Argus Media to monitor price trends across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nCara Wong, Asia-Pacific associate editor at Argus Media, says those shifts are already visible in Russia's export data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing more damage to Russian refining infrastructure, and loading data is already showing a drop in diesel exports,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although Australia doesn't buy directly from Russia, it affects the entire diesel market because it tightens supplies a little bit more \u2026 Further restrictions on fuels made from Russian crude would have an outsized impact on Singapore benchmarks.\"\n\n\n\nDisruptions to Russian oil refining\n\nBeyond sanctions, Russia's own refining sector has come under sustained attack. Ukrainian drone strikes have disabled a significant share of its capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy late September, up to 38 per cent of refining infrastructure was temporarily offline, according to analysts cited by Reuters and Lenta. Tatiana Mitrova, Global Fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told SBS Russian that the cumulative impact of these strikes is proving difficult to reverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Equipment shortages, sanctions on repairs and a new wave of attacks are prolonging Russia's recovery,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a result, export volumes are shrinking just as demand rises into the Northern Hemisphere winter.\"\n\n\n\nAnalysts say these disruptions add to the broader mix of geopolitical and market pressures already shaping global prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nSycamore says that, as well as sanctions on Russia, other global shifts are also feeding volatility; namely, trade tensions affecting global demand for crude oil.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent signs of progress in US\u2013China trade talks have lifted market confidence and pushed the Australian dollar higher against the US dollar, with some analysts predicting it could trade as high as 70 US cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nA stronger dollar can take some pressure off local fuel prices, Sycamore says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And, importantly, OPEC has been increasing production \u2014 partly to offset the impact of Russian embargoes, but also to regain market share.\"\n\n\n\nMitrova adds that the global market has so far proven resilient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When the EU restricted imports, it narrowed Russia's export niche, mainly for diesel. But the global oil products market is highly flexible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says these measures create logistical difficulties rather than a genuine shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Finding new buyers, rearranging shipments, and processing transactions under sanctions takes time and money, but the trade continues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a similar pattern was seen in 2022 \u2014 when sanctions disrupted trade routes and drove up freight and refining costs, pushing Australian fuel prices above $2.30 a litre \u2014 this time the market appears more adaptive.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Institute of Petroleum, the national average retail diesel price currently sits around $1.85 a litre.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Russian. It has been updated to include various perspectives on the impact of sanctions.\n\n\n\n",

A few important points I want to make about this list. Technology is fast changing and ever evolving, which means this will never be a static list.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Grant has reiterated this distinction when asked why platforms like twitch or steam weren't included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We assessed steam and steam chat separately... We assessed steam as having four current purposes... They did fall more into the online gaming platform, and they fell within the class of service specifies in the rules as exempted because their primary purpose is enabling users to play online games with other users, even though there's still online social interaction as part of their features. So it's - Twitch is still being evaluated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA disturbing global phenomenon where Australian girls are being targeted by sadistic men is happening on platforms like Roblox.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Grant has been asked why Roblox wasn't therefore included in the legislation even if was technically a gaming platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister Wells and Ms Grant say that financial and sexual extortion are of a great concern to them, and in negotiations with Roblox they have ensured age assurance technologies will be implemented to stop adults from using the service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commissioner says the government has put an extensive onus back on the platforms themselves to prevent circumvention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are so many signals that they can and are picking up now device IDs.

    "text": "One in three Australian households went whole days without eating or compromised on meal choices in the last 12 months, according to a report released on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from food relief charity Foodbank suggests that food insecurity has worsened when compared to 2024, leaving 3.5 million families facing hardship that \"is not getting better\".\n\n\n\n\n\nFoodbank Australia CEO Kylea Tink said that the \"reality for families\" is worsening, despite targeted government assistance such as one-off energy rebates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Families are skipping meals, or they're only feeding certain members of the family at certain meals, or in the worst-case scenario, they're going whole days without eating at all,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The real concern for us here is that with this data cumulatively now what we're seeing is this is a systemic endemic issue that is not getting better, and it's why we're really calling on the federal government to come to the table and work with us to help fix it.\"\n\n\n\nMore renters skipping meals\n\nOne of the most likely groups to experience food insecurity is renters, according to the report, with one in two renting households affected in the past year.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Foodbank Australia CEO Kylea Tink SBS News 08:27 English\n\nJessica Menace has been a renter for five years, and told SBS News that \"costs are getting worse\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I left home at 17 when I ran away from home due to safety issues. Part of me wishes now that I could go back and stay at home as long as possible,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would tell my past self 'stick around, it's going to be really expensive. We're going to have a rental crisis'. The rental system is just not working properly\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 22-year-old is a full-time student in Canberra and is on Youth Allowance, a government scheme supporting full-time students aged 18 to 24. She receives just under $900 a fortnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe pays $1,000 per fortnight in rent and works to make up the gap.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News When she can't meet the difference, she does her shopping at Foodbank, but even its heavily subsidised food can be out of reach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just a normal thing now to be cutting meals,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I usually have maybe two meals a day if I'm lucky or one.\"\n\n\n\nJessica Menace says \"costs are getting worse\". Source: SBS News / Supplied In a good week, Jessica said she goes to a discount supermarket to buy beef mince and make meals for the week. But often she cannot afford meat or fresh fruit and groceries, opting for cheap microwave meals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You need variety in your diet and I'm not getting that,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I don't really see that happening any time in the near future unless they drastically increase youth allowance and all the other payments as well. I just can't afford that sort of food.\"\n\n\n\nHarms of poor nutrition\n\nEmeritus professor Amanda Lee from the University of Queensland's School of Public Health told SBS News that poor nutrition has detrimental health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe explained that junk food is typically more affordable than groceries, leaving financially stressed households to buy more processed and unhealthy food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Often in households that are struggling to make ends meet, you've got mothers in particular who go without food to try and improve the diet of their children, and that means that their future children can be compromised in terms of their nutrient intakes during pregnancy,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really a very insidious and surprisingly common problem in a country like Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee said that lower socio-economic households and single-parent households tend to experience some of the poorest health outcomes.\n\n\n\nThis decline in nutrition quality can lead to or exacerbate chronic illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People that can't afford basic healthy foods then often rely on the cheaper options that are very dense in energy so that obesity becomes a problem,\" Lee said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it's a really horrible form of malnutrition because there's a double whammy of the chronic diseases associated with excess weight gain and poor health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said that advertising also plays a role in the overconsumption of unhealthy food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In our society, the foods that are most available and advertised and affordable tend to be those that have got very limited nutrient gain,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really encourages people to spend more on the least healthy items as well.\"\n\n\n\nOther vulnerable groups\n\nThe report from Foodbank also identified other groups that are vulnerable to food insecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found 67 per cent of households that include someone living with a disability or health issue experienced food insecurity in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, 68 per cent of single-parent households are now food insecure.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Overall, one in five households earning $91,000 or more experiences food insecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\nTink said that there can be intersections between these more at-risk groups, which can further put households at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, an estimated 7.6 million tonnes of food is wasted each year, according to Foodbank, costing the economy over $36.6 billion annually.\n\n\n\nIs a new tax the solution?\n\nFoodbank is supporting a National Food Donation Tax Incentive, which would change tax laws to incentivise small and medium-sized food producers to donate surplus food.\n\n\n\n\n\nTink explained that the proposed tax incentive would provide a cashback or tax credit for businesses, such as farmers or growers, based on the costs incurred in donating food.\n\n\n\nSimilar models are in place in the United States, Canada and France.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For many food producers, it is cheaper to bury the excess or send it to the tip than to ship it to charities and donate,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're asking the government to provide those sorts of businesses with a tax incentive that would let them claim a small tax deduction at the end of the year to help offset that additional expense.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Food and Grocery Council CEO Colm Maguire told SBS News the incentive is a practical step to increase food donations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" Food and grocery manufacturers are committed to addressing food insecurity, but the associated costs can be a barrier. A targeted tax incentive would help offset these costs, making it easier for companies of all sizes to participate in food relief efforts,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This reform has the potential to transform the food relief sector to increase reliable supply chains that deliver real social and environmental benefits.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "US oil production has increased, from the record average of 13.3 million barrels a day last year under the Biden administration to what the International Energy Agency predicts will be an average of 13.5 million barrels a day this year, but the slump in oil prices is likely to result in a sharp fall in drilling activity next year. Is the US experiencing \u201cthe most successful economy in the history of our country,\u201d as Trump claimed? If the sharemarket were any guide, the answer would be an unequivocal \u201cyes\u201d. It\u2019s up 17.5 per cent since last year\u2019s election, albeit that it is being driven by the boom in artificial intelligence rather than the economy\u2019s wider settings. Those with an exposure to the market, which tends to be the wealthier households, certainly see the Trump presidency as a success. They were also the major beneficiaries of the big tax cuts in Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d that has since been rebranded, for obvious political reasons, as the \u201cWorking Families Tax Cut Bill\u201d.\n\nThe wealthy (the Trump family in particular) have also benefited from the massive surge in the value of crypto assets that has occurred since Trump embraced an asset class he once derided and which the Biden administration viewed with suspicion and cynicism. In the real economy, and for the less wealthy and poor US households, things aren\u2019t quite as buoyant. The US economy grew at 2.4 per cent last year. Trump\u2019s \u201cgreatest economy\u201d, one he repeatedly claims is the envy of the world, and which he said on Wednesday is seeing \u201cthe American Dream surging back to life\u201d, will grow, according to the International Monetary Fund, 2 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2026. US consumers don\u2019t appear to believe that Trump is making America affordable again, with his approval rating dropping from 47 per cent early this year to 37 per cent in recent polling. Credit: Getty Images The now-record government shutdown will shave up to a percentage point off the December quarter GDP, although much of that should be recovered once the government re-opens and its furloughed employees are paid again.\n\nUS government debt was $US36.1 trillion at the end of last year. It\u2019s now above $US38 trillion and rising. Despite Elon Musk and DOGE taking a chainsaw to the US bureaucracy and more than 100,000 federal government employees sacked, the budget deficit forecast by the Congressional Budget Office of $US1.8 trillion this year will only be marginally smaller than last year\u2019s $US1.83 trillion, despite Trump hacking into the massive spending Biden was making in green energy and advanced manufacturing. Loading There\u2019s been a lot of talk this year about the \u201cdebasement trade\u201d, or investors selling US dollar-denominated assets because they are worried that, to escape its debt trap, the US will allow inflation and money-printing or more extreme measures that will erode the value of the dollar and the real value of their investments. The US dollar, while it has bounced back from its September lows, has fallen about 5 per cent against the basket of America\u2019s major trading partners\u2019 currencies. It had fallen more than 10 per cent before the US Federal Reserve Board\u2019s first rate cut this year in September.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s campaign, Trump said that, if he were elected, the dollar would be \u201cso secure\u201d. \u201cYour reserve currency will be the strongest it\u2019ll ever be,\u201d he said. Hmm. US interest rates have, of course, fallen, with the yield on the 10-year bond rate down from 4.27 per cent at the end of last year to about 4.15 per cent and the yields on shorter-duration Treasuries by even more. He\u2019s now got less than a year to turn his claims of overseeing the greatest economy ever into something real. That\u2019s a function, however, of the weakening of economic growth, reflected in an unemployment rate that has begun edging up from 4.1 per cent in the December quarter last year to 4.3 per cent in the most recent available data.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s beloved tariff regime holds up against legal challenges \u2013 the arguments before the Supreme Court justices who\u2019ve previously been very supportive of Trump\u2019s agenda on Wednesday don\u2019t appear to have gone well for the administration \u2013 it will continue to undermine growth and fuel inflation. According to Goldman Sachs, about 55 per cent of the costs of the tariffs will, by the end of the year, be borne by US consumers and 22 per cent by US companies, with foreign exports absorbing 18 per cent. Goldman expects consumers could pay up to 70 per cent of their cost by the end of next year, underscoring that \u2013 contrary to what Trump and his advisers constantly claim \u2013 it is US consumers, and US companies, that pay the overwhelming majority of the tariffs\u2019 cost. Trump promised to \u201ctariff the hell out of countries that have been taking advantage of us\u201d. He\u2019s kept that promise, but he failed to tell voters (or perhaps he didn\u2019t understand) that it meant introducing a big new and highly regressive domestic tax on consumption. In those trade deals, and from some arm-twisting of US companies, Trump has obtained promises of massive investments in the US. The White House claims they total $US8.9 trillion, although that would include previously planned expenditures and probably some that will never be made once (if?) Trump departs the White House.\n\nEven a decent slice of those commitments would, however, help build manufacturing investment and jobs in the US, which, given that the US manufacturing sector has, according to the ISM Manufacturing PMI, been shrinking for eight months straight, is much needed. Manufacturing investment and jobs grew strongly during Biden\u2019s term. Loading Trump has over-delivered on his promises to deal with illegal immigration, even if the brutal measures taken by ICE to execute the policies appear increasingly unpopular. He\u2019s also had some foreign policy wins. However, it\u2019s the domestic economy and policies that impact Americans\u2019 costs-of-living that produced the election outcomes this week and that will decide the shape of Congress \u2013 and the effectiveness of the last two years of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 at next year\u2019s mid-terms. He\u2019s now got less than a year to turn his claims of overseeing the greatest economy ever into something real.",
