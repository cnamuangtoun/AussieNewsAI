    "text": "Two days after sending the economy reeling by announcing widespread tariffs , US President Donald Trump insisted his trade policies will never change as he remained ensconced in a bubble of wealth and power in Florida.\n\nHe woke up on Friday morning at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, and headed to his nearby golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.\"\n\nSeveral supporters stood on the sidewalk as Trump, wearing his signature red \"Make America Great Again\" hat and white polo shirt, glided down a street lined with palm trees.\n\nUS President Donald Trump waves as he arrives at the Trump International Golf Club, Friday, April 4, 2025, in West Palm Beach, Florida (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThey waved to him and he waved back, part of a ritual that plays out every weekend that he's in town.\n\n\ufeffThe Republican president was not expected to appear publicly, although he's scheduled to attend a candlelit dinner for MAGA Inc., an allied political organisation, on Friday evening.\n\nHe spent Thursday in Miami at a different one of his golf courses, where he attended a Saudi-funded tournament. He landed in Marine One and was picked up in a golf cart driven by his son Eric.\n\nTrump has often proved impervious to the kind of scandals or gaffes that would damage another politician, but his decision to spend the weekend at his gilded properties could test Americans' patience at a time when their retirement savings are evaporating along with the stock market.\n\nUS President Donald Trump arrives at the Trump International Golf Club, Friday, April 4, 2025, in West Palm Beach, Florida (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThe tariffs are expected to increase prices by thousands of dollars per year and slow economic growth, and there are fears about a potential recession.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday that the tariffs were \"significantly larger than expected\" and are \"highly likely\" to cause more inflation \u2014 at least in the short term but possibly in the long term as well.\n\nHowever, Trump has described his policies as a painful yet necessary step to encourage companies to relocate their operations to the United States, and he spent the morning defending himself on Truth Social, his social media platform, vowing he is sticking with his policies.\n\nAlthough experts have harshly criticised Trump's tariffs, he's found some support on TikTok. He shared a video that said \"Trump is crashing the stock market\" and \"he's doing it on purpose\" as part of a \"secret game he's playing, and it could make you rich.\"\n\nThe full list of Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs View Gallery\n\nThe goal, the video said, is to push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, something that Trump explicitly called for later in the morning.\n\n\"This would be a PERFECT time\" for Powell to cut interest rates, he wrote. \"CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!\"\n\nWith foreign leaders scrambling in response to Trump's announcement this week, the president lashed out and looked to cut deals.\n\nHe said he spoke with Vietnamese leader To Lam and claimed Vietnam wants to eliminate its tariffs on US goods if it can make a deal with the US.\n\nHe also criticised China for announcing its own tariffs on US imports.\n\n\"CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!\" he wrote.\n\nRepublicans suggested that Trump's policies would be the start of a parley with foreign countries.\n\nSpecialist Anthony Matesic works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, April 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\n\"The president is a dealmaker if nothing else, and he's going to continue to deal country by country with each of them,\" said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming.\n\nHe added that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told Senate Republicans this week that the tariffs would be a \"high level mark with the ultimate goal of getting them reduced\" unless other countries retaliate.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Trump's tariffs \"a brutal pincer move with American families trapped in the middle.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump also celebrated a new report showing the US added 228,000 jobs in March, beating expectations.\n\nAlthough the numbers were a snapshot of the economy before the tariff announcement, Trump claimed vindication, saying they already show his moves are working.\n\n\"HANG TOUGH,\" he wrote. \"WE CAN'T LOSE!!!\"",

    "text": "President Donald Trump said he is signing an executive order to keep TikTok running in the US for another 75 days to give his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.\n\nCongress had mandated that the platform be divested from China by January 19 or barred in the US on national security grounds, but Trump moved unilaterally to extend the deadline to this weekend, as he sought to negotiate an agreement to keep it running.\n\nTrump has recently entertained an array of offers from US businesses seeking to buy a share of the popular social media site, but China's ByteDance, which owns TikTok and its closely held algorithm, has insisted the platform is not for sale.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\n\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress,\" Trump posted on his social media platform.\n\n\"The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.\"\n\nTrump added: \"We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"\n\nA spokesperson for ByteDance confirmed in a statement that the company has been discussing a \"potential solution\" with the US government but noted that an \"agreement has not been executed.\"\n\n\"There are key matters to be resolved,\" the spokesperson said. \"Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.\"\n\nTikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritizes user safety, and China's Foreign Ministry has said China's government has never and will not ask companies to \"collect or provide data, information or intelligence\" held in foreign countries.\n\nTrump's delay of the ban marks the second time that he has temporarily blocked the 2024 law that banned the popular social video app after the deadline passed for ByteDance to divest.\n\nTrump's delay of the ban marks the second time that he has temporarily blocked the 2024 law that banned the popular social video app (AP Photo/Richard Vogel)\n\nThat law was passed with bipartisan support in Congress and upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, which said the ban was necessary for national security.\n\nIf the extension keeps control of TikTok's algorithm under ByteDance's authority, those national security concerns persist.\n\nChris Pierson, CEO of the cybersecurity and privacy protection platform BlackCloak, said that if the algorithm is still controlled by ByteDance, then it is still \"controlled by a company that is in a foreign, adversarial nation-state that actually could use that data for other means.\"\n\n\"The main reason for all this is the control of data and the control of the algorithm,\" said Pierson, who served on the Department of Homeland Security's Privacy Committee and Cybersecurity Subcommittee for more than a decade.\n\n\"If neither of those two things change, then it has not changed the underlying purpose, and it has not changed the underlying risks that are presented.\"\n\nThe Republican president's executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits in the little more than two months he has been in office, but his order delaying a ban on TikTok has barely generated a peep.\n\nNone of those suits challenges his temporary block of the law banning TikTok.\n\nThe law allows for one 90-day reprieve, but only if there's a deal on the table and a formal notification to Congress.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Russell Brand charged with rape and sexual assault\n\nIf the extension keeps control of TikTok's algorithm under ByteDance's authority, those national security concerns persist. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel)\n\nTrump's actions so far violate the law, said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota.\n\nRozenshtein pushed back on Trump's claim that delaying the ban is an \"extension.\"\n\n\"He's not extending anything. This continues to simply be a unilateral non enforcement declaration,\" he said.\n\n\"All he's doing is saying that he will not enforce the law for 75 more days. The law is still in effect. The companies are still violating it by providing services to Tiktok.\n\n\"The national security risks posed by TikTok persist under this extension, he said.\n\nVitus Spehar, who runs the TikTok account @UndertheDeskNews, said that although they benefit from the extension, they are \"concerned about the precedent Trump has set for directing his Department of Justice to not enforce laws passed by Congress.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see a bill passed to repeal the ban, and an end to this back and forth once and for all,\" they said.\n\nThe extension comes at a time when Americans are even more closely divided on what to do about TikTok than they were two years ago.\n\nRoughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren't sure. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50 per cent in March 2023.\n\nRoughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren't sure.\n\nAmong those who said they supported banning the social media platform, about 8 in 10 cited concerns over users' data security being at risk as a major factor in their decision, according to the report.\n\nTerrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire, has been trying to grow his presence on other platforms since a ban was threatened in January.\n\n\"I'm glad there's an extension, but to be honest, going through this process again feels a bit exhausting,\" he said.\n\n\"Every time a new deadline pops up, it starts to feel less like a real threat and more like background noise. That doesn't mean I'm ignoring it, but it's hard to keep reacting with the same urgency each time.\"\n\nHe is keeping up his profile on Instagram, YouTube and Facebook in addition to TikTok.",

From potential interest rate cuts to the likelihood of a global economic downturn, this is what you need to know.\n\nDonald Trump singled out the Australian beef industry while unveiling new tariffs. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nWill Australians be hit with price rises due to the tariffs?\n\nNot directly.\n\nTariffs are paid \ufeffby the importer, not the exporter, so the consumers who are likely to face higher prices are Trump's own constituents: the American people.\n\n\"The US will, of course, bear the brunt of the inflation uplift,\" Wilsons Advisory head of investment strategy David Cassidy said.\n\nMeat and Livestock Australia (MLA)\ufeff, which is particularly impacted by the tariffs given Trump singled out Australia's beef exports and ban on American beef, said local shoppers needn't worry about new price rises.\n\n\"US tariffs will impact the prices paid by American families and may have flow-on impacts on the supply chain,\" MLA managing director Michael Crowley said.\n\n\"It is unlikely these changes will make a difference to retail prices here in Australia.\"\ufeff\n\nMeat prices are unlikely to rise in Australia due to the tariffs. (Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)\n\nSo what will the impact on Australia's economy be?\n\nIt's worth noting from the outset that the exact impact of the tariffs is up in the air, and will be dictated by a range of factors, including other nations' responses (particularly China's) and whether there are more taxes to be announced.\n\nThat said, similarly to the steel and aluminium tariffs , the direct impacts on the Australian economy will likely be limited.\n\nOnly about 4 per cent of exported Australian goods go to the US, leaving the vast majority unimpacted.\n\nThe full list of Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs View Gallery\n\n\ufeffGold and pharmaceuticals, which are two of the top five exports to the United States, also appear to have been exempted from the tariffs, providing further reprieve for the local economy.\n\nThe biggest direct impact will be felt by the beef industry. Worth billions of dollars each year (the Red Meat Advisory Council puts the figure for 2024 at $4.16 billion), it is Australia's biggest export to the US, and simultaneously the US is the Australian beef industry's biggest market.\n\nWhile exports will continue despite the tariffs, it's likely to lead to less demand for Australian meat.\n\n\"Our beef industry will need to look for alternative markets to stay viable,\" Professor Robert Brooks from Monash Business School said.\n\nAustralian beef exporters will need to find new markets for their produce. (9News)\n\nWhat about indirect impacts on the Australian economy?\n\nThis is where things start to get a bit more worrisome.\n\nThe Australian stock exchange \u2013 \ufeffas with plenty of other share markets \u2013 has already spent a day swimming in the red following the tariff announcement.\n\nIt closed the trading day down a little more than 1.07 down on Thursday, roughly a $33 billion loss, which was actually an improvement on the more than $50 billion shed in the hours after Trump made the new taxes official.\n\nLocal industries are also worried about the potential for other nations \u2013 many of whom have been hit far more severely by the new tariffs \u2013 to \ufefflook to Australia as a new or increased market for their goods now the US is a less viable option.\n\nThat could lead to them dumping a high volume of cheap produce here, undercutting local businesses.\n\nShare markets have been swimming in the red following Trump's tariff announcement. (Peter Braig)\n\nThe federal government announced some financial support to encourage shoppers to buy Australian during last week's federal budget, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese yesterday said anti-dumping measures will be strengthened.\n\nThen there's the risk of a global economic downturn if Trump's tariffs are met with retaliation and a widespread trade war breaks out.\n\n\"While Australia's direct trade exposure to the US is minimal, the knock-on effects via China and broader Asian nations that have seen hefty tariffs could weigh on our export-heavy economy, especially if global demand slows and commodity prices retreat,\" eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert said.\n\n\"For a small, open economy like Australia, any slowdown in global growth would have an impact locally.\"\n\nTrump's 'Liberation Day' announcement in the Rose Garden View Gallery\n\nOne particularly important economy is China, where, as our largest trading partner, a reduction in demand would hurt Australian exporters.\n\n\"What happens to growth in China will be critical,\" Brooks said.\n\n\"Any slowdown there, particularly as a result of escalating trade tensions, could have ripple effects for the Australian economy.\"\n\nSome economists are\ufeff worried the tariffs could go as far as to spark recessions in the next nine months.\n\n\"These policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and global economy into recession this year,\" JPMorgan analysts said in a note to investors.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump places tariffs on uninhabited islands off coast of Antarctica \ufeff\n\nThe prosperity of Australia's econnomy is closely tied to China.

(ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nAfter Mr Galli died at the age of 92 in 2021, his daughters Elizabeth Galli and Elena Zadow decided to contribute $10,000 to the project to make what was then called \"Alberto's Dream\" come true.\n\nMaking women stand proud\n\nSouthend Progress Association member Ruth Vander Hoek has been coordinating the construction of the monument that will be officially opened on Sunday.\n\nShe said women were finally being recognised for their important role in making Southend what it is today: a pleasant, if windy, place to live and holiday.\n\nRuth Vander Hoek has spent many hours volunteering on the project. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\n\"It's really important for the status of the women to know that, yes, they were really important because often life just goes on and it's not acknowledged,\" Ms Vander Hoek said.\n\n\"It's like 'get the next meal, do this, do that, go out to work'.\n\n\" I know that, especially with the older women in town, it's just been lovely to see how it's made their chests puff up, really. \"\n\nAbout 300 people live in Southend, which is popular for its beach and access to Canunda National Park. (ABC South East SA: Sam Bradbrook)\n\nThe monument ended up costing $50,000, with other funding coming from Country Arts SA, Arts South Australia, donations from individuals and the Beachport and Millicent Lions, along with in-kind support from the Wattle Range Council.\n\nIndigenous design\n\nThe 2.4-metre-high monument's shape mimics the design of the local Boandik people's wooden houses called \"wurla\".\n\nThe idea came from mosaic artist Mike Tye, from Goolwa, who has also created similar artworks in the South East and on the south coast, some of them with Indigenous and maritime motifs.\n\nOn one side of the arch is an Aboriginal woman wearing a traditional possum-fur cloak with a baby on her back, while the other side features a woman wearing a dress in the Italian colours of red, white and green standing beside a child.\n\nMike Tye travelled from Goolwa to install and tidy up the monument before its official opening.

    "text": "Audiences are increasingly spending their entertainment hours on social platforms rather than traditional film and television, Deloitte's 2025 Digital Media Trends report has found.\n\nConsumers are shifting away from pay TV to streaming services, and time spent on short-form video and social platforms is climbing.\n\nThe shift is causing stress in the traditional media market, as companies scramble to adjust their business models to fight off stagnation.\n\nHow are audiences getting their content?\n\nDeloitte surveyed more than 3,500 consumers in the United States and found that media companies and advertisers were competing to fill an average of 6 hours of daily media consumption per person \u2014 a number Deloitte said did not seem to be growing.\n\nIn those 6 hours, most people will have a mix of streaming, live television, user-generated content (UGC) on social media, podcasts and more.\n\nProfessor Carah says traditional media companies are trying to work out how to exploit short-form video platforms. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\nProfessor Nicholas Carah at the University of Queensland said the mash-up of platforms and formats had led traditional media producers to alter their approach.\n\n\"They're basically trying to work out how to create content that works on both streaming platforms and short video platforms,\" Professor Carah said.\n\n\"You see how many streaming shows on Netflix often have these kind of dance sequences, for example, that show up on TikTok as a viral trend first \u2026 that's not an accident.\"\n\n\"They're kind of thinking about how they craft moments in shows that translate really well on short video.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nThe twilight of pay TV\n\nDeloitte's research suggests that the television itself is here to stay, with 66 per cent of people watching TV shows or movies doing so on a smart TV, compared with only 12 per cent of the audience who prefer to watch on a smaller screen, such as a phone or tablet.\n\nAcross almost all demographics, consumers seem to be drifting away from pay TV and towards streaming video on demand (SVOD).\n\nThe survey found 49 per cent of US consumers had either a cable or satellite television subscription, a steep drop from 63 per cent of respondents in Deloitte's 2022 report.\n\nDo we still need free-to-air TV? Photo shows A colourful graphic featuring a TV icon, a teen girl, a remote, and ABC, SBS, Nine, Seven, Netflix, Disney+ and other logos. Ratings data shows young people are turning away from traditional television in droves in favour of online streaming platforms and social media. But an expert says free-to-air television still has a role.\n\nMost use it for live news (43 per cent) and sports broadcasts (41 per cent), although this has become a less attractive option for audiences as SVOD services have gained ground in news and sports broadcast rights.\n\nWith news and sports more often available on SVOD platforms, consumers are beginning to baulk at the cost of television subscriptions.\n\nThe report found US subscribers spent an average of US$125 ($205) every month on their TV subscriptions, almost double the US$69 subscribers said they paid on average each month on a suite of streaming services.\n\nThe creator economy\n\nYounger people are engaging with entertainment media in a different way to their older counterparts, the report found, with 56 per cent of gen Zs and 43 per cent of millennials reporting that they find social media content more relevant to their interests than film and television.\n\nAbout half of gen Z and millennials surveyed also said they felt a stronger connection with content creators on social media than they did with traditional celebrities.\n\nYounger generations view social media content as more relevant to their interests. (ABC News: Sean Tarek Goodwin)\n\nProfessor Carah said creator culture had shifted more towards accessibility and away from the \"stylised\" and aesthetically focused ways of early influencers.\n\n\"So they're much more \u2014 I hesitate to say authentic \u2014 but they're much more kind of relatable,\" he said.\n\n\"And in a way, the medium affords that because of the phone and the way they produce it, and the shortness of the videos, and that kind of relatability, the unscriptedness of it, the sometimes messiness, it just doesn't translate well into the medium of scripted television.\"\n\nAussie creators appealing to the masses Photo shows Danny and Michael sitting down looking down at a screen Australian creators are reaching tens of millions of people around the world by tapping into audiences who have an appetite for content not being picked up on mainstream channels.\n\nThe fact that younger generations were moving away from traditional narrative formats did not mean they were necessarily losing value, Professor Carah said.\n\n\"If you're spending more time on short video, you're not encountering those long, reflective narratives, and I think that does change our minds and the way we speak and the way we feel,\" he said.\n\nBut he said audiences were more likely to encounter real cultural diversity on short-form media than they were on mainstream television.\n\n\"We should kind of try and think about where young audiences are at and what they've lost that we used to have, but maybe also what they've gained in terms of the relatability, the diversity of voices,\" he said.",

    "text": "At a time of historic global uncertainty, Rita Saffioti has lots of reasons to love her job as WA treasurer.\n\n\"I'd be a lot more nervous if I was a treasurer of another state,\" the veteran economic boffin told Stateline.\n\nThere's good reason for her upbeat mood, given she presides over the healthiest set of budget books in the nation.\n\nAs other states rely on debt to fund their major projects, Saffioti is preparing to finish the last of Labor's flagship 'Metronet' projects which, despite its $12 billion-plus price tag, have been delivered at the same time as record surpluses.\n\nRita Saffioti enjoyed a bumper surplus in her first state budget, but how long can the good times roll? (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\nThose good times are drifting into the rear-view mirror though as the iron ore price returns to more normal levels \u2014 a decline which could be accelerated by Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs.\n\nWhile WA's direct exposure to Trump's tariffs is small \u2014 the US is WA's 10th-largest export market \u2014 it's the flow-on effects which matter most.\n\nThat's because nearly two-thirds of Western Australia's exports go to China, Japan or South Korea \u2014 three countries hit with the biggest tariffs.\n\nBecause WA is so reliant on the trio, any hit to their economies could quickly flow through to ours.\n\n\"Yeah, [I'm] definitely concerned about the indirect impact,\" Saffioti said.\n\n\"We wanted to see a very strong economic growth across our trading nations, across the world, and these tariffs, \u2026 [have had] probably one of the most significant or seismic impacts across the world.\n\nRita Saffioti says the government is keeping a close eye on the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs around the region and the globe. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\n\"We've already seen the fallout on the share market and on other commodity prices, so we are very much monitoring the impact.\"\n\nConfidence remains\n\nBut that concern isn't enough to diminish Saffioti's confidence in her budget.\n\n\"We've budgeted conservatively and that means that you can withstand shocks, and shocks like these new tariffs that Donald Trump is introducing,\" she said.\n\n\"We've got a whole range of different commodities that feed into our budget, of course iron ore being the key, but we've always budgeted conservatively for iron ore.\n\nRita Saffioti says WA is well-placed to absorb the seismic economic shock created by Donald Trump's tariffs. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\n\"There will always be challenges, there will always be more demand, in particular in key areas like health, but we'll continue to make sure we can deliver the services without those cuts.\"\n\nIt's a bold statement given the uncertainty ahead.\n\nCommittee for Economic Development of Australia chief economist Cassandra Winzar said while probably true, there were steps the government should be taking to firm up its fortunes.\n\n\"We've got pretty strong private sector spending, particularly in the resources sector, and we do also have a lot of government spending, so there's a lot of money going around the economy,\" she said.\n\n\"So what we really need to think about is around timing.\n\nCassandra Winzar says the WA government should plan some infrastructure projects for lean times ahead. (ABC News: James Carmody)\n\n\"Maybe in the future, if we're seeing softer private market spending, softer business investment, that might be the time that we want government to have something, some projects, ready to go to stimulate the economy.\n\n\"It's not huge cuts that we should be making, but we should be thinking really carefully about every dollar that's spent and whether it needs to be spent now, or whether there are some things that we can hold off for future times.\"\n\nMining reliance\n\nWestern Australia's vulnerability to needing that kind of stimulus stems from its growing reliance on one industry. No prizes for guessing which one.\n\nPressing play on this chart shows how the state's leaders have struggled to diversify the economy away from its most lucrative honeypot, which would reduce the risk of global shocks flowing through.\n\nBut Saffioti defended the government's efforts.\n\nRita Saffioti became WA treasurer in June 2023, and her job could be about to get more difficult. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\n\"We have embarked on a strong diversification through supporting new value-adding and new industries, such as in the north-west and of course new markets,\" she said.\n\n\"We've had a series of expansion of our international trade commitments in particular through South-East Asia as well as other parts of Asia.\"\n\nIs it too little too late, given the lopsidedness of that pie?\n\nRita Saffioti defended the government's record on diversifying the economy. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Saffioti said.\n\n\"We've made some major efforts already in diversifying \u2026 and of course, it's going to be the main focus of our government going into the future.\"\n\nWA Treasurer Rita Saffioti walks with Premier Roger Cook as he prepares to attend the first meeting of his new cabinet. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nMajor focus or not, turning around WA's reliance on what's beneath its surface won't come quickly or easily.\n\nNo 'serious attempt'\n\nAnd while some are optimistic it can be done, independent economist Conrad Liveris is less convinced.\n\n\"It's hard to see that there's been any serious attempt at that,\" he said.\n\n\"So I think we do need to take a step back and get some proper independent analysis to really outline what are the opportunities for Western Australia in the next five years, in the next 10 years, in the next 20 years and beyond.\"\n\nConrad Liveris says the WA government has not done enough to reduce reliance on the resources sector. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nLiveris said those efforts needed to embrace mining and use its strengths to build other industries, not try and compete with the \"elephant that is in every room\".\n\n\"We've got this massive industry that dwarfs all others, and actually we've got to use that to our advantage, to diversify the economy, not to pretend that it's not there,\" he said.\n\nThat's something the government has spoken about with the 'Made in WA' pledge it took to the election.\n\nThe WA government is restructuring its departments, but what actually changes? Photo shows WA Premier Roger Cook wearing a suit and tie smiling at a lectern. WA Premier Roger Cook is making changes that will impact a third of government departments.\n\nBut a glossy brochure is much easier to produce than real economic change, especially when so much money is flowing in one direction.\n\nBumpy road ahead\n\nAfter years of high iron ore prices and a boosted share of the GST making the job of managing WA's budget easy, in the eyes of critics, factors outside of the state government's control could force its senior members to earn their keep.\n\nHave they, and their predecessors, really built the budget into a stable set of books capable of weathering even a Trump-sized storm? Or will difficult decisions have to be made when push comes to shove?\n\nWestern Australians have become accustomed to big surpluses, huge spending on infrastructure and a healthy helping of cost-of-living handouts in recent years.\n\nA larger-than-expected economic shock could bring all of that to a sharp end, and take some of the shine off Saffioti's enthusiasm for one of the state's most important jobs.",

    "text": "What do you get when two strongmen become mates?\n\nFor US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the answer so far has been chemistry, an aligning of ideas and a shared vision for \"MEGA prosperity\" that will make both their countries great again.\n\nBut when those political strongmen are nationalist \u2014 as they so often are \u2014 and prioritise domestic interests above all else, in a global economy, at some point, something's gotta give.\n\nA seemingly equal partnership will eventually tilt in favour of one party, who will emerge with more power \u2014 perhaps military, economic or, in this case, negotiating.\n\nAnd the other might be left wondering, like a kid in the playground whose friend has just turned on them: \"How could they do that to me?\"\n\nThat is certainly one way of looking at Mr Trump's doling out of 26 per cent tariffs to India as part of his \"Liberation Day\" sweep.\n\nDonald Trump announced his new tariff regime in the Rose Garden at the White House. (Reuters: Carlos Barria)\n\nDuring his announcement, he again described Mr Modi as a \"great friend\" before adding he told the Indian PM: \"You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right. They charge us 52 per cent, and we have charged them almost nothing for years and years.\"\n\nThat was despite days of trade negotiations between the two countries last week, working towards a bilateral trade agreement slated to start around September, which will likely see India shave huge numbers off the high tariffs it currently applies to US imports in exchange for concessions.\n\nModi snubbed on tariffs as Trump pushes 'reciprocal' trade Photo shows Two men speak at a press conference at the White House. Modi left Washington without a tariff exemption as Trump reinforced reciprocal duties, amid talks on trade, defence, and immigration \u2014 plus an awkward Trump moment with an Indian reporter.\n\nThe Indian government has already reduced tariffs on Harley-Davidson bikes and Bourbon whiskey and has rolled back the \"Google tax\", a 6 per cent levy on online advertisements placed with foreign tech companies like Google.\n\nGovernment sources told Reuters last week that India would be open to cutting tariffs on more than half of US imports worth $23 billion in the trade deal's first phase.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC after Mr Trump's announcement, South Asia Practice head for the Eurasia Group Pramit Pal Chaudhuri said India had put forward a \"reasonably radical tariff proposal\" of zero tariffs for zero tariffs on 70 per cent of goods traded between the two countries.\n\nSome had hoped that proposal for the bilateral trade agreement, plus the goodwill from the longstanding friendship between the two countries' leaders, may have won India a complete exemption from this week's tariffs.\n\nNow that it hasn't, it has some asking the question \u2014 is the bromance over?\n\nUnsurprisingly, opposition politicians in India have cried foul that Mr Modi has bowed down to Mr Trump.\n\nBut others say this is exactly what Mr Modi knew would happen \u2014 and he's got a plan that, ultimately, will wind up benefiting India.\n\n'The optics are bad'\n\nLeader of the opposition Congress party Rahul Gandhi told parliament on Thursday that the 26 per cent tariff would \"completely devastate\" India's economy, and accused Mr Modi's BJP party of long-time deference to other nations.\n\n\"When asked, do you lean left or do you lean right? They say, 'No, no, no, we bow our head right in front of every foreigner that comes in front of us,'\" he said.\n\nThe party's president, Mallikarjun Kharge, said the tariffs showed Mr Trump was a \"businessman\" whose \"customer\", Mr Modi, was \"trapped\", despite a surface friendship of \"hugging, talking, laughing\".\n\nIndia's opposition says the government needs to stand up to Trump. (AP: Ben Curtis)\n\nSenior Congress MP Manish Tewari described it as \"an abject failure of the negotiations that were taking place between the US and the government of India\".\n\n\"The government needs to develop a spine and stand up to the US,\" he said.\n\nThe tariffs are the latest in a series of recent incidents that some \u2014 especially, unsurprisingly, opposition politicians \u2014 have branded as the US bullying India.\n\nOutrage flared most notably over the way the US handled and deported illegal immigrants from India, shackled and chained, in the same week a video was shared on the White House's Instagram page titled \"ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight\", designed to have viewers find comfort in the sounds of handcuffs and chains being put on immigrants.\n\nOne Indian journalist said the images of deportees landed so badly with Indians not because they thought the illegal immigrants should not have been deported, \"but because Modi's India can't imagine any country meting out such a humiliating treatment to Indians when he is at the helm\".\n\nBut, when it came to the tariff announcement, it appears it's only the political opposition who is really concerned.\n\nWhat is a tariff? A tariff is a tax on a product imported from another country\n\nfrom another country It's paid to the government by the company that imports the product\n\nthat imports the product The tariff is generally calculated as a percentage of the price paid by the importer to the foreign seller\n\npaid by the importer to the foreign seller Historically, tariffs have pushed up prices as higher product costs are often passed on to consumers\n\nPolitical analyst Pramit Pal Chaudhuri from the Eurasia Group and Ananta Aspen Centre of India conceded that, for Mr Modi, \"the optics are bad\".\n\nBut he doesn't think it will damage his reputation, nor impact how the Indian government deals with Mr Trump going forward.\n\n\"Modi's politically in a very strong position,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, among his right-wing backing \u2014 which is about 40 per cent of his vote share and about maybe 10 to 15 per cent would be his ideological supports \u2014 for them, the idea that he's conceding to the United States or to any other country on sovereignty grounds would be damaging.\n\n\"[But], I don't think he's that concerned.\n\n\"My sense is there's a 'keep calm and carry on' position in India.\n\n\"[Mr Trump] comes out violently against everybody, and he is much more critical of other countries and governments.\n\n\"So there's a sense in India of, OK, this guy is what he is. Let's just focus on the overall policies of the government, or what Trump does, as opposed to what he says.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nAll eyes on bilateral trade agreement\n\nIn initial comments to media after the announcement, a commerce ministry official said the Indian government was \"analysing\" the impacts of the tariffs.\n\n\"It is a mixed bag and not a setback for India,\" the official said.\n\nJunior finance minister Pankaj Chaudhary reiterated that a few hours later.\n\n\"For Donald Trump, it's America first, and for PM Modi, it's India first,\" he said.\n\n\"We will analyse it first, then assess its impact and see how to deal with it.\"\n\nHow Trump's tariffs will hit Asia Photo shows US President Trump holds up a board showing the reciprocal tariffs on other countries at the White House rose garden. The new tariffs are a blow for nations that have powered economic growth by opening large markets in the US for manufactured goods.\n\nThe seemingly business-as-usual approach is a stark contrast to countries that have vowed a stiff response to the tariffs.\n\nIndustry groups, on the whole, also do not appear particularly rattled by the announcement or by the likelihood of India scrapping its own tariffs significantly in any eventual bilateral trade agreement.\n\nOn the contrary, some are saying the comparatively low tariffs on Indian goods compared to many of its Asian neighbours mean India could swoop in and take over their markets.\n\nThere appears to be consensus among commentators and some industry groups that the focus should now be on nailing the bilateral trade agreement and that the tariffs are merely a bump in the road.\n\n\"Trump sees this as a leverage issue,\" Mr Pal Chaudhuri said.\n\n\"I've hit you with tariffs and now, therefore, I have leverage on you.\"\n\nHe argued that Mr Modi and his team understood this about the president \u2014 after all, his negotiation tactics were spelled out in his book, The Art of the Deal \u2014 and saw a few months of tariffs before a bilateral trade agreement kicked in as just the price of doing business.\n\nIn any event, the US's local manufacturing capacity \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 means there was likely never a chance the two countries would ever let this get in the way of their relationship.\n\nThe market share India enjoys, and stands to widen, means they are willing to be \"more flexible than any other country in the world\", according to economics professor Dr Ashwini Mahajan.\n\nHe is the national co-convenor of the right-wing Swadeshi Jagaran Manch organisation, which is affiliated with the far-right, Hindu-nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, which has huge influence over Mr Modi's government.\n\n\"We know that the US is a high-cost economy,\" he said.\n\n\"They do not have much production capacity for many goods.\n\n\"India is not going to get any harm. There are certain commodities which are essential for the US population that they will have to import from us.\"\n\nMr Pal Chaudhuri said, despite the outcries from Congress, the relationship between India and the US was unlikely to be destabilised at all.\n\nHe said that now the Indian government was working with the US to stop, and deport, illegal immigrants, all that was left to smooth over was Mr Trump's issue with India's historically high tariffs.\n\n\"If we sign a bilateral trade agreement by the end of this year, you effectively [will] have removed the two biggest irritants in the relationship,\" Mr Pal Chaudhuri said.\n\n\"For India, this is not even a question. America is simply too important for us to consider anything else.",

    "text": "The Moreton Bay islands of North Stradbroke (Minjerribah) and Moreton (Mulgumpin) played a crucial role in weakening Tropical Cyclone Alfred as it hurtled towards the south-east Queensland coast last month.\n\nAs the cyclone moved inland, the islands helped weaken its force from a category two system to a category one.\n\nTucked between the islands and the mainland, an oyster lease in the marine park of Moreton Bay also weathered the storm.\n\nIt was shielded not just by geography, but by an innovative wave suppression structure designed to protect the oyster baskets.\n\nOyster farmer Colin Wren is the architect behind the floating barrier \"wall\".\n\nThe Moreton Bay oyster lease spans 6 hectares, with 30,000 baskets producing millions of oysters each year. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"The Queensland oyster industry has been struggling for a bit. There's been no innovation \u2026 we've come here, we've looked at the area and just went, 'I think we can make this work,'\" Mr Wren said.\n\nQueensland has very few open-water oyster farms, but Mr Wren is defying the odds with his wave suppression wall, which allows him to operate a successful and sustainable oyster lease.\n\nHe built the floating structure using 300-millimetre pipes, some filled with foam allowing them to stay buoyant, and others flooded with water to anchor to the sea floor.\n\nAlthough the design currently falls outside government regulations, the Queensland government is actively reviewing its viability.\n\nInnovative solution\n\nMr Wren's 6-hectare farm houses 30,000 oyster baskets growing 4 million oysters. When Tropical Cyclone Alfred hit, the structure kept everything safe and secure.\n\n\"What that does is, when a wave comes along and hits it at the top, it keeps a bit of heaviness about the pipe so it can calm down the roll,\" he said.\n\nColin Wren from Gold Coast Oysters helped pioneer Queensland's first flip farm system. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nHis engineering skills ensured none of the oyster bag lines broke away, preventing contamination of the marine park and saving the business from catastrophe.\n\nAndrew Robson, president of the Queensland Oyster Growers Association, also owns an oyster farm in Moreton Bay and believes Mr Wren's wave suppression system is the future of the industry.\n\nCalm green water and oyster baskets separated from the open sea by a line of wave suppression pipes. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\n\"[It's] structurally sound and sets a new standard for the industry \u2026 people aren't tying styrofoam boxes together that are floating around the bay,\" Mr Robson said.\n\n\" It looks amazing. It looks safe, it looks clean. But then on top of that, the productivity is so much better. \"\n\nOpen-water farming game changer\n\nWith his wave suppression invention Mr Wren has been able to introduce the flip farming method, which is used in estuaries and can be found in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\n\"We are the first people in Queensland to be doing the flip farm system. And so far it's been really, really good for the business,\" Mr Wren said.\n\n\"The flip farm, it's got rid of all of the manual handling \u2026 we're not tipping baskets. It's a very, very efficient system.\"\n\nWithout barriers to buffer the wind and waves, farming in exposed waters like Moreton Bay wouldn't be possible. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nAccording to Mr Wren, the flip basket system has proven effective in controlling over-catch and barnacle settlement during spawning, resulting in significantly cleaner oysters.\n\nThe mechanised design also reduces manual labour by making it easier to flip the basket, lightening the overall workload.\n\nThe black piping in front isn't waste; it's a custom-built wave wall protecting thousands of oyster baskets. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nMr Robson said the local industry had remained small for years, with an annual turnover of about half a million dollars \u2014 a stark contrast to other states where oyster industries generate tens to hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\n\n\"This floating system will revolutionise the Queensland industry. [Mr Wren is] demonstrating this, [through] the speed in which he's producing oysters, [and] the quality of oysters that he produces,\" Mr Robson said.\n\n\"What he's done is basically establish or demonstrate the potential of the Queensland industry \u2026 we haven't had a major change in the way oysters are farmed in Queensland for decades.\"\n\nCollaborative future\n\nMr Wren has no plans to patent the design of his wave suppression wall as he wants it to be available to the oyster industry.\n\n\"When we first started farming in Queensland, we always knew that we had to protect our farm somehow \u2026 we had our fleet farm baskets exposed to the wind for four months and our oysters weren't doing anything at all,\" Mr Wren said.\n\nThe Queensland government is funding an engineering and design report for the structure.\n\nNurtured in open bay conditions, these oysters are built to thrive. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nMr Robson is hopeful with the state's approval, it will be easier for new growers to introduce the same floating system.\n\nWhile he admits some back and forth with regulators is taking time, he's confident the payoff will be worth it.\n\n\"I hate the word, but it's a game changer for the industry. I think as a result of this, the industry will boom over the next decade,\" Mr Robson said.\n\nAndrew Robson, left, believes innovations like Mr Wren's could help revitalise the state's oyster industry. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)\n\nAfter several years of design development and four different prototypes, Mr Wren believes his latest structure is the one for the future.\n\nIf the government approvals are granted, he will provide the intellectual property to any oyster farmer who wants it.\n\n\"We have created something pretty special here,\" he said.\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm on Sunday or on ABC iview.",

    "text": "At first glance, it\u2019s an aging freight yard on the edge of Darwin\u2019s industrial area.\n\nBut for the past decade, the Port of Darwin has been at the centre of a geopolitical argument, after the NT government leased it to a Chinese-owned company in 2015.\n\nThe 99-year lease deal to Landbridge Group by the former Country Liberal Party (CLP) government created plenty of national security awkwardness both at home and abroad.\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama said he would've liked to have had a \"heads up\" over the deal \u2014 and successive Australian prime ministers have said it should never have gone ahead.\n\nBut now, after 10 years of reviews, national debate and scrutiny, both Labor and the Coalition have made federal election promises to get the lease back into Australian hands.\n\nThe former Country Liberal Party NT government sold the port in 2015. (Supplied: NT Government)\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with the port?\n\nOn the backdrop of increased tensions with China, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton have been racing to drop duelling pledges regarding the Port of Darwin.\n\nIn a statement, the Coalition pledged it would \"act in the national interest to immediately secure the Port of Darwin\" and return it to an \"Australian government-approved operator\" if it won the election.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton said that if a new operator could not be found within six months, the Coalition would compulsorily acquire the port and compensate Landbridge.\n\nPeter Dutton says a Coalition government would aquire the port if a buyer isn't found within six months. (AAP: Bianca Di Marchi)\n\nThe Coalition was in power when the port was leased, and for two more ensuing terms.\n\nBut this is the first time Mr Dutton has so clearly spelled out that the Coalition believes Landbridge's time with the port is up.\n\nWhile the Albanese government is yet to provide the exact details of its plans to end Landbridge's Darwin port lease deal, it has also given a commitment to do so.\n\nIn an impromptu call to ABC Radio Darwin late on Friday afternoon, the prime minister claimed his government had been working on a plan to deal with the port for months.\n\n\"We will enter into negotiations to do that, that is what we have been doing informally through potential buyers up to this point already,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\nAnthony Albanese called into ABC Radio Darwin on Friday afternoon. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nEarlier this year, long-term port lease critic and Northern Territory Labor MP Luke Gosling started making cryptic statements about federal support of a possible sale of the Port of Darwin lease.\n\nBut nothing was made clear, and the NT government responded with anger, accusing Mr Gosling of creating \"mass uncertainty\" and stirring up a political hornet's nest over the port.\n\nWhy is it happening now?\n\nThe Coalition says it\u2019s acting in the face of an increasingly uncertain geopolitical climate.\n\nIt said taking back the port from Landbridge, a company with noted connections to China\u2019s ruling communist party, would bring greater security to the Australian Defence Force.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that this piece of critical infrastructure, which is directly opposite to the Larrakeyah Defence Precinct, is operated by a trusted, Commonwealth-approved entity,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nWhy did we lease Darwin Port to a Chinese company? Photo shows Darwin Port sign behind barbed wire. The controversial lease Darwin Port remains in the spotlight amid China\u2019s new security pact with Solomon Islands. So, how and why did it happen?\n\nThe promise comes after three Chinese warships entered Australia\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone in February and conducted live fire exercises in the Tasman Sea.\n\nIt also follows the recent arrival of a US nuclear submarine into Darwin Harbour, which docked just a short distance away from the Landbridge-leased port.\n\nOn Landbridge\u2019s side, their hold on the port lease has also been under a recent cloud.\n\nLate last year, a PwC audit revealed significant financial concerns within the company and found there was \"material uncertainty\" over its ability to keep the port for the long haul.",

(Supplied: HealthShare NSW)\n\nZdenka Fuller, assistant director of food supply and nutrition services at HealthShare NSW, which provides meals for hospitals, says as a business model, honing the menu made sense.\n\n\"It was always part of the plan; however, it's such a complex operation that the timing for that process to happen was now,\" Ms Fuller said.\n\n\"It makes it easier for us as a business to manage the whole food supply chain across NSW and ensure supply across distribution when we want to make changes.\n\n\"Because we had many different menus across NSW, more than 100, we decided to standardise those, so we're in the process of rolling out a standardised menu across public hospitals.\n\n\"We've rolled it out to most of NSW, we've just got the Hunter, New England, Mid North Coast and northern NSW to go.\n\n\"It means that we offer a lot more of the same product so rather than having a pantry of many different items across NSW, it means they are using the same types of items.\"\n\nHospital food is made both on and off-site.\n\nIt's a combination of commercially purchased food, products made by NSW Health food production units, and items made freshly on-site in hospital kitchens, such as salads and sandwiches.\n\nFor dessert, patients can choose from a menu of 10 cafe-style cakes. (ABC Illawarra: Sarah Moss)\n\nThousands of cakes\n\nTo keep up with demand, hospital dessert supplier Homebush Bay Cakes, a bakery in Sydney's inner west, operates from 4am till midnight every weekday.\n\n\"We produce 6 tonnes of product a day, but a tonne of product at 45 grams is thousands and thousands of units per day,\" baker Jamie Bishop said.\n\n\"We batch them and provide a frozen use-by date to NSW Health; some products are three days, some products are five days, but generally they're going to NSW Health frozen.\"\n\nJamie Bishop says the bakery operates from 4am to midnight five days a week. (Supplied: Homebush Cakes)\n\nSuppliers now produce a larger volume of the item required, and their product is distributed by contractors across NSW.\n\n\"For example, a company like Homebush Bay Cakes would deliver their product to a distributor and then that distributor distributes that product across NSW,\" Ms Fuller said.\n\nNutritionally dense desserts\n\nWorkers apply icing to a batch of chocolate lava cafe-style cakes. (Supplied: Homebush Cakes)\n\nThe bakery's cafe-style cakes offer patients a choice from 10 nutritionally dense desserts.\n\n\"A band one dessert can go onto every menu and generally has to have 5 grams of protein and be classed as high in calcium,\" Mr Bishop said.\n\n\"Gone are the days where people thought let's give people low-fat, low-energy, no-sugar products in hospital, the thinking has changed.\n\n\"That's why our cakes are sweet, high energy and high [in] calories because people need calories to get better.\"\n\nDessert is part of the standarised menu in public hospitals in NSW. (ABC Illawarra: Sarah Moss)\n\nAs much as possible basic raw ingredients are sourced from local producers and on average 80 to 90 per cent of the ingredients they use are Australian made.\n\n\"Our flours are all based in NSW, our eggs are all local, we do try to support NSW producers but unfortunately some ingredients we don't make in Australia,\" Mr Bishop said.\n\nStatewide menu Examples of some of the options Breakfast Cold and hot cereal including porridge and semolina Bread with spreads Protein such as baked beans, scrambled eggs and chicken congee soup Lunch and dinner Soup Pre-packaged mains such as beef meatball, roast chicken, halal lamb kofta and omelette Plated mains such as macaroni cheese, chicken panang curry, and sweet potato and spinach dahl Salads Egg and cheese Roast beef Sandwiches Roast pork and apple sauce Avocado and salad Desserts Carrot cake Apple crumble Sticky date pudding Patients on special diets are offered a modified menu.

He\u2019s proud,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cHe\u2019s like everyone. He wants to really start to get some positive results. He\u2019s a proud leader of our footy club. All our leaders are like that. Of course he\u2019s going to be disappointed.\u201d Disappointment is becoming commonplace at Melbourne. That they have been a contender as recently as late 2023 fuels hope the first month of this season is a blip, but the reality is they are no longer a good team. Since they beat Geelong on the first weekend of May last year, the Dees have won just five of 19 games \u2013 the win-loss record of a bottom-four side.\n\nThe problems which cruelled their premiership bids of 2022-23 remain. Their forward line and delivery inside 50 is still a mess, only now they no longer have a dominant midfield or a miserly defence living their mantra of contest and defence. They lost the contested ball again. When you take that out of Melbourne\u2019s game they have little else to threaten opponents. Jack Bowes of the Cats is tackled by Caleb Windsor of the Demons. Credit: Getty Images The vaunted trio of Petracca, Clayton Oliver and Jack Viney were rarely at the centre bounce together, if at all. Max Gawn won his duel with Rhys Stanley on points but in previous years it was one of the defining match-ups of the game.\n\nBayley Fritsch is a shell of the player that booted 50-plus goals in 2021-22. Kysaiah Pickett was the Dees\u2019 most dangerous midfielder, but his spark was needed inside 50. They are robbing Peter to pay Paul, but both Peter and Paul remain poor. \u201cFirst game back, I thought he contributed really strongly,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a helluva lot of work to get involved in that midfield group and he\u2019s going to be a huge player as the year goes on.\u201d Geelong\u2019s total of 165 marks, and the differential of 83, is the most the Dees have conceded under Goodwin. The lopsided count was not necessarily reflected on the scoreboard but defending saps energy, and by retaining the ball it prevented the Dees from entering their preferred contest mode. Goodwin was more concerned with what Melbourne did with the ball than without it, but his counterpart Chris Scott spoke with the satisfaction of a man who had seen a plan bear fruit, even if the final number surprised him.\n\n\u201cIf you kick it to [Steven] May all night, you\u2019ll have a difficult night, that\u2019s probably the crux of it,\u201d Scott said. Loading \u201cAs the game went on we felt it got better for us. We thought we were playing pretty well early on, just didn\u2019t get the gap on the scoreboard that we thought we should have \u2013 that always makes you a bit nervous. \u201cThe players\u2019 willingness to really commit to the style we were after, we were impressed by.\u201d Seventeenth with a percentage that betters only Richmond and West Coast, the Dees are giving their rivals a big start.

At the same time, other car manufacturers began to cut. Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, said it was pausing production at assembly plants in Mexico and Canada and temporarily laying off 900 workers at five US facilities following the tariff announcement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the jobs figures showed \u201cthe economy is starting to roar\u201d and \u201cthe president\u2019s push to onshore jobs here in the United States is working\u201d.

Vietnam had offered to cut its tariffs to zero, Trump said, following what he called a productive phone call with Communist Party General Secretary To Lam. But following China\u2019s retaliation, Trump wrote in an all-caps post on Truth Social: \u201cChina played it wrong, they panicked \u2013 the one thing they cannot afford to do!\u201d China is the US\u2019s third-largest export market led by oilseeds, grain, semiconductors, oil and gas.\n\nTrump\u2019s son Eric Trump posted: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with [Donald Trump].

Loading \u201cWe\u2019re the largest consumer market in the world, and yet the only thing we export is services, and we need to stop that,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe need to get back to a time where we are a country that can make things, and to do that, we have to reset the global order of trade. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say economies are crashing. Markets are crashing because markets are based on the stock value of companies who today are embedded in modes of production that are bad for the United States.\u201d\n\nFrench Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Europe would enact a \u201cproportionate response\u201d aimed at bringing the US to the negotiating table. He said the EU should not \u201creply with the same weapons\u201d, as retaliatory tariffs on US imports to Europe could hit European consumers. Instead, Lombard said Europe was working on a response that could go beyond tariffs to include taxes or regulations to target businesses but not whole sectors. A Downing Street spokesman said the UK would be guided by the national interest and Starmer would calmly continue with preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate. \u201cWhile the global economic landscape has shifted this week, it has been clear for a long time that like-minded countries must maintain strong relationships and dialogue to ensure our mutual security and maintain economic stability,\u201d he said. In the US, early signs of a backlash to the market rout were evident in Congress, where four more Republican senators joined as co-sponsors of a bill introduced by Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democrat Maria Cantwell of Washington. The bill would terminate new tariffs within 60 days unless the US Congress explicitly approves them.\n\nThat followed an earlier bill passing the Senate that would unwind the emergency declaration Trump used to justify tariffs on Canada. However, it was unlikely to pass the House of Representatives. A sustained trade war \u201cwould be a terrible outcome\u201d, says Republican senator and Trump supporter Ted Cruz. Credit: Bloomberg Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas and Trump supporter, said there were \u201cenormous risks\u201d to the president\u2019s tariff strategy. \u201cThe good scenario is other countries freak out \u2026 and in response, other countries come rushing to the White House and say: we want to negotiate a deal and we\u2019re going to dramatically lower our tariffs to US goods,\u201d Cruz said on his Verdict podcast. \u201cIf we\u2019re in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive American tariffs and massive tariffs on American goods and every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome.\u201d",

First and most important is we've got to get our greenhouse gas emissions down as fast as possible by moving beyond fossil fuels. That's coal, oil and gas to renewable energy. That's essential to limiting future harms. We're already seeing a real acceleration in the impacts of climate change and worsening fire seasons, more destructive storms and downpours. Now, the second thing we have to do at the same time is adapt and build our resilience and learn to cope with these various impacts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, in 2008, the federal government initiated the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility to develop the knowledge decision-makers needed to effectively adapt Australia to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut its findings are yet to be translated into action.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat lag is reflected in a new report by researchers at Monash University.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found local action on climate adaptation remains insufficient across tiers of government, with little change over the decade between 2012 to 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-author and Adjunct Senior Research Fellow at Green Lab in the Monash Business School, Dr Michael Spencer, says that's despite willingness from vulnerable communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says those who have experienced bushfires, coastal erosion, flooding and drought want to help create adaptation measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The governance structures weren't there, the finance wasn't there, the means of implementation wasn't there. So, in order to actually act on that information, you need to have the capacity to act, you need to have the governance regime at a local level to act, and you need to have access to the funds to actually implement that action.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA second study, by researchers at the University of New South Wales, has found disaster recovery is being delayed by a lack of strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLead researcher and inaugural Judith Neilson Chair in Architecture at the University of New South Wales, Professor David Sanderson, says top-down bureaucracy has stifled any meaningful effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a global evidence truth that the best recovery is as localised as possible. But we have in Australia and elsewhere systems which are largely top down and the sweet spot is supporting recovery of communities rather than, if you like, directing from afar. That's a quick summary of a complex story, but what we've noticed in our research \u2013 and again in pretty much every country \u2013 local governments are tasked with a lot of the picking up the pieces, if you like, but yet are woefully under-resourced.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also says short-term solutions are wasteful and rob vulnerable communities of the chance to build resilience in the face of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A kneejerk political reaction \u2013 it often is to think quick, we need to build temporary housing after a disaster and that's all over the place. But the problem with temporary housing is it's slow, it's expensive, and there's really a plan for what to do afterwards. So, we're arguing that temporary housing, if you build it, is an absolute last resort. There may be arguably a case for it, but a last resort and there must be a plan for its investment in continuation afterwards. There must be a plan for its investment in continuation afterwards so it's a valuable asset to the community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shortfall in strategy has also accelerated cost-of-living pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Treasury's Intergenerational Report pointed to the escalating costs of natural disasters borne by taxpayers, which reached $7 billion in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Spencer says those higher costs are reflected in insurance policies and in other ways that are less immediately detectable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Natural disasters, which have a very dramatic impacts and you're seeing the impact of that in your insurance policies. In the last quarterly CPI, insurance was one of the biggest areas of increase in terms of cost of living. But the slow burn is in things like health and mental health, and we tend to not take as much notice of those areas because they're very slow, but cumulatively they can be just as severe if not more severe than the natural disaster impact.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 Climate Trauma study by the Climate Council found 80 per cent of Australians experienced some form of disaster at least once since 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason for that, Dr Bradshaw says, is houses are being zoned and built in high-risk areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's fair to say that updates to planning regulations have just not kept up with the increasing impacts of climate change, be that flood risk or be that fire risk. Now, we have seen some improvements here, some re-zoning, some restrictions on building in particularly flood prone areas. But we do still have new developments being built on flood plains and we still have an enormous number of our houses built in places where people are inevitably going to face real difficulty in future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile stressing urgency, Dr Spencer says the way adaption efforts are approached needs to be more holistic, pointing to what he calls \"district modelling\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Climate impacts don't respect jurisdiction. They will cross jurisdictions of local government, they'll involve the catchment management authority, they'll involve the chamber of commerce. So, the challenge is to cross jurisdictional boundaries, but also institutional silos. In Australia and in many other parts of the world, we tend to put responsibility for adaptation into our silos but we need to see it as an integrated whole. So the first thing is how we bring all those different players together in order to deal with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Bradshaw says the only way forward is to listen to those on the front lines of the climate crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These impacts aren't felt equally, and we need to have a mind to those who were particularly exposed and vulnerable in our community. It was a few years ago on Masig Island and the Torres Strait Islands where we saw that communities there were working with almost no external support to hold back the coastal erosion using old tires and pallets, anything at their disposal and have been trying so hard to get additional resources to protect their islands and their millennia-old connection to place there. We need to be really listening to and looking out for those on the front lines of this crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Government will deliver its now-overdue new National Climate Risk Assessment and National Adaptation Plan after the election.\n\n\n\n",

And sometimes they would get exceeding, and that's why I potentially left the other learning consultant role. I was so despondent with it because I thought, are you not seeing what I see?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what has gone wrong with Australia's early childhood education and care system?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problems within the sector rest on multiple fronts and make for a complicated web of policy, workforce education and regulation issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand it, we need to look at how early childhood education and care is provided and funded in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEarly Childhood Education and Care in Australia hasn't always been a for-profit enterprise or been available to for-profit providers. So, in the seventies when childcare was originally introduced and funded by the Commonwealth, the system was built around direct subsidies provided to not-for-profit services. And they were able to regulate the qualification levels of staff. The Commonwealth used its funding to position childcare as a public good.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was University of Sydney Department of Political Economy Professor Elizabeth Hill explaining the impact government childcare subsidies have had on the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subsidies support the cost of early childhood education and care - the subsidy is given to families to purchase a service they want to use and is then paid to that service when the child enrols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut then there was, we've had increased participation of women in, paid work and by the 1990s, there was real pressure on the federal government to expand the provision. And so at that point, federal government subsidies started to be extended to for profit providers, and that really changed the landscape in terms of who owns and who provides those services.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gave private investors incentive to open childcare centres to be provided by a mix of for-profit and not-for-profit suppliers.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildcare has become increasingly popular amongst commercial property investors, who can open centres with supportive government funding without being regulated by the government in terms of how they run, staff or locate their centres.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Childhood Australia CEO Samantha Page highlights the problems that occur when childcare services are opened as profit-making ventures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have what we call childcare deserts, which is where we have no services available to families because the numbers of children are too small or because providers simply have chosen not to go into that community. Particulary in regional and remote areas. We also have a problem with oversupply. So, If you've got too many services in one community, they're all competing for the same pool of staff, for the same children. And half empty services are not good, they're not viable and they're not high quality generally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guidelines for childcare quality regulation are written under the National Quality Framework and enforced by state and territory regulators working under The Australian Children\u2019s Education & Care Quality Authority ((ACECQA)).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Authority responded to the recent investigations into unsafe for-profit services by taking action against the operators, and trying to ensure that 91 per cent of Australia's services are meeting or exceeding the National Quality Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government's 2024 Productivity Commission found that these regulators, like most areas of the early childhood education and care sector, are under-resourced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe early childhood education and care profession is amongst the lowest paid in Australia and has been historically undervalued.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Hill says this is because it's a hyper-feminised workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that early childhood education and care has been normalised as women's work has meant that it's been historically undervalued. There's been a lot of change in the attitude of the public, but workers are still waiting for that attitude and that revaluation of their work to be reflected in their professional wages.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poor treatment of these educators means students don't choose to study early childhood education past entry level qualifications.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly childhood specialist Victoria Mack says the profession is viewed as an option of last resort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know even when I was working at TAFE, and we'd have some of the students that they would start their cert three coming through tafe and they would say to us, oh, you're good with children or you're not very good at all maths and science, you're not going to get into uni, so you can just go and do childcare. I think sometimes these young girls go into early childhood and night-long daycare centres, and they don't see another option for them. I mean, I was an early childhood teacher and I had an opportunity to do lots of different things. I've worked overseas in international schools as an early childhood teacher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a federal election looms, calls have been heard across the sector to address the problems in Australia's early childhood education and care system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government has responded by saying it intends to take action against dodgy providers and improve childcare policy in consultation with state government regulatory bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Childhood Australia CEO Samantha Page says it's also time to value early childhood education and care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The profession itself is really, very strong. We have a code of ethics, we have teaching standards we have the national quality standards. I think theres a strong and positive identity for early childhood educators and teachers. We need the rest of the country to see that. And we wanna recognise that the people who work in those services are educators and teachers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "To wrap up a whirlwind first week of election campaigning, both major parties are vowing to buy back the Port of Darwin, with competing announcements made within minutes of one another.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe port was leased for more than $500 million to Beijing-controlled company Landbridge Group in 2015 by the former Northern Territory Country Liberal government, something Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said \"he had always opposed\".\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling in to ABC Radio Darwin's talkback line, Albanese said a re-elected Labor government would begin negotiations immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been talking with superannuation funds about getting it back into Australian hands.\"\n\n\n\nThe news came while Opposition leader Peter Dutton was mid-air on a flight to Darwin to make his own announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Dutton said a Coalition government would not permit the lease of the Port to \"any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by a foreign government\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the current geopolitical environment, it is vital that this piece of critical infrastructure, which is directly opposite to the Larrakeyah Defence Precinct, is operated by a trusted, Commonwealth approved entity,\" Dutton said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Albanese Labor government has continued to create uncertainty regarding this important national asset, tip-toeing around the issue while refusing to take concrete action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only a Coalition government will end the uncertainty regarding the Port of Darwin once and for all.\"\n\n\n\nBoth Dutton and Albanese indicated they would be prepared to use taxpayer funds if a private buyer could not be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We prefer that it be through superannuation funds or some other vehicle that doesn't mean direct taxpayers, but we're prepared to go down the road of taxpayer direct involvement as well,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\nNational security concerns\n\nThe port has been a point of concern for almost a decade. The concerns have mainly focused on national security threats, but Albanese said economic reasons were also a factor in the plan for it to be brought back into Australian hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Landbridge have not had the investment into the port that's required to bring it up to scratch,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe promised details ahead of the May 3 poll and insisted it was not an election stunt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's something that we have had a consistent view on ... we opposed it at the time (it was leased),\" he told ABC Radio.\n\n\n\nQuestioned in 2022, then prime minister Scott Morrison \u2014 who was treasurer at the time the port was leased \u2014 said the federal government had \"no authority ... to reject, approve anything in relation to the leasing of that asset\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMorrison also said in 2022 that the federal government would only act in relation to the port lease \"if there is advice from the Defence Department or our security agencies that change their view about the national security implications of any piece of critical infrastructure\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, the Department of Defence and ASIO gave their approval to the lease of the port \u2014 a view that hasn't publicly changed since.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese launched a review into the circumstances of the lease of the Port of Darwin following the 2022 election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found \"it was not necessary to vary or cancel the lease\" as \"there is a robust regulatory system in place to manage risks to critical infrastructure\" and \"existing monitoring mechanisms are sufficient and will be ongoing\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The billion-dollar problem that neither Albanese nor Dutton wants to become a big issue\n\nThe Albanese government accepted that advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians can have confidence that their safety will not be compromised, while ensuring that Australia remains a competitive destination for foreign investment,\" the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said in a statement in October 2023.\n\n\n\nLandbridge says 'port is not for sale'\n\nOn Friday night, Landbridge said it had not been consulted before the announcements were made.\n\n\n\n\n\nLandbridge's non-executive Australian director Terry O\u2019Connor said: \"Landbridge and Darwin Port have not been involved in any discussions with the federal government concerning our lease arrangements .\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As previously stated, and confirmed by our owner, the port is not for sale,\" a statement provided to SBS News read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Landbridge considers the port a long-term investment that has reported record operational performance this year. We expect this growth to continue in the future.\"\n\n\n\nLabor member for Solomon Luke Gosling raised the prospect of a public-private partnership involving federal funding for the Port of Darwin earlier this year. Credit: MICK TSIKAS/AAPIMAGE The potential for the port to be brought into Australian hands was raised by federal Labor MP for Solomon Luke Gosling earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, Northern Territory Minister for Logistics and Infrastructure Bill Yan also called for the federal government to \"end the uncertainty they have created on the future of Darwin Port\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Finocchiaro CLP government has been engaging with the federal government since November 2024 looking at options for Darwin Port,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Northern Territory government will continue engaging in good faith with the federal government, and our priority is to ensure the best deal for the Territory in the national interest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYan said the NT government would \"take all steps necessary to secure\" the port's future.\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi Mousina described the 4.8 per cent fall as \"a really deep fall for one day\u2019s trading\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the US, the tech sector was hit the worst, followed by communication and consumer discretionary,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the stock market movements had been especially dramatic because they exceeded market expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The market responds to whether things are better or worse than expected, it is always relative based on expectation,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The tariffs announced were a bit higher \u2014 I think there was some expectation that it might not be as bad as that.\"\n\n\n\nStock market alternatives\n\nMousina said investors may respond differently depending on the timeline for their stock investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those investing long term may say, 'Yes my portfolio is going to take a hit in the short term', but there are offsets potentially through things such as cash, exposures, or commodities,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For short-term investors, people who rely on their superannuation, it is obviously difficult,\" she said, but added that savvy investors could put money in other assets such as bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the offsets to the decline in shares is the increase in the value of bond portfolios,\" Mousina said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonagh said this was already happening, with investors turning away from volatile stock markets and reallocating funds to US government bonds (Treasuries).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Treasuries have reduced significantly, their interest rate has dropped now over the past couple of days, very significantly... so that's one sign that tells you, investors are pulling money out of stock market and they put it into treasuries.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, commodities such as gold reached a record high overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gold is just seen as a sort of a hedge to inflation, a hard commodity, it is highly tradeable and has an intrinsic value,\" Mousina said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said some investors may see the falls as an opportunity to invest in more reliable and reputable stocks but pointed out that Trump\u2019s tariffs may have an even greater impact on the markets into the future and there may be further losses to be seen.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect next\n\nMcDonagh said until the full extent of how other countries respond to the tariffs , it was difficult to predict what would happen in global stock markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone needs to kind of hold off a little bit and just see what happens with the negotiations over the coming weeks and months,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said there was potential for Australia's mining industry to be affected in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Stocks that are dependent on the Chinese economy will probably be most at risk of going down over the next few weeks and months,\" McDonagh said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australian stocks that are heavily dependent on China will face a lot of headwinds.\"\n\n\n\nHe said many of those included companies with investments in Vietnam, where 46 per cent tariffs were in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In trade, tit-for-tat is normally the rule,\" McDonagh said .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And the US has said, if countries respond, they will further respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nMousina said there were indicators that the market may not shift too much more in the next few days, at least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you look at futures markets, futures markets is basically futures trading, so what trade is saying share market might do tomorrow, so not just tomorrow but over the next day of trading after it closes today, that\u2019s actually pointing up for Australia, which is good news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will continue to happen, but the US futures market program at the moment is still a very slight negative.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice; you should consult with a licensed professional to make the decisions that are right for you.\n\n\n\n",

But unfortunately plastic pollution is still decimating our environment. It's harming our marine life and there's estimated to be over 250 kilograms a minute of plastics leaking into Australia's environment. That's a huge amount and demonstrates that there's a lot more work that needs to be done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers hope the study will be used as a benchmark for evaluating future policies and practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates like Shannon Mead agree, saying the problems need to be addressed with targeted policy measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's because other initiatives like container deposit schemes are proving to be an effective way of reducing plastic pollution, decreasing the number of drink containers in the environment by 40 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Hardesty says community action is making a difference too.\n\n\n\n",

And it's going to be, it's going to be a booming country, a very booming country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe penalties have also drawn condemnation from other world leaders reckoning with the end of a decades-long era of trade liberalisation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer says they are not going to panic, and will instead act in their national interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And the national interest is to continue our negotiations for a deal with the US, which we've made progress on, and to ensure that we work with the sectors of the industries most impacted. And that's why, amongst other things, I had a roundtable for some of those businesses this morning. But we must act in the national interest. A trade war is in nobody's interest, in my view. But of course we have to protect ourselves and that's why we're keeping all options on the table.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is a ten percent minimum tariff on most goods imported to the U-S, the European Union has a higher rate - 20 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump says he is open to negotiations with the UK and other countries if they offered what he has described as something phenomenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Europe is already considering retaliatory action.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron says European companies have called for the suspension of investment in the U-S, a proposal French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot says has some merit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Solidarity, as I said, is unfailingly required today from all members of the Alliance. Solidarity, which is nevertheless tested by the decisions that were taken and announced yesterday (April 2) by (U.S.) President Trump with the application of reciprocal tariffs which will have negative consequences on the American economy as well as on the economies of all the members of the Alliance. This is also the case for the European economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrederic Zeimett is the C-E-O at a champagne house in France's Champagne region of Epernay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U-S is the largest market for French wine and spirits, with shipments to the country rising five per cent in 2024 to 6.63 billion dollars [[$3.8 billion euros]].\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Zeimett says the US is his company's primary export market - and it would be hard for champagne producers to shift to other trading partners.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has called the move a tragedy for global trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has announced a limited set of counter measures against U-S tariffs, and says the Canadian government will follow the U-S approach by imposing a 25 per cent tariff on all vehicles imported from the United States that are not compliant with the U-S-Mexico trade agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says Canada won't stop there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will fight to bring each of these tariffs to an end. We're fighting in courts, challenging that these tariffs have been illegally imposed under US law. We have filed disputes underscoring that they are in violation of our free trade agreement, CUSFTA. We have gone to the World Trade Organisation because these actions are against international trade law. We are responding today with, and we have responded throughout, with carefully calibrated and targeted counter tariffs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Asia, China has accused the U-S of bullying them through the new measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese imports into the US will now attract a 34 per cent levy, on top of an earlier 20 per cent tariff, while Japan faces a 24 percent tariff, and South Korea, 25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Bangladesh, the U-S is the largest market for the country's thriving $ 50 billion ready made garment industry, accounting for nearly $16 billion in exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nClothing factory owner Nasiruddin Chowdhury says everyone is in shock they will be required to pay a 37 percent tax on export items from Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s bad news for us if double tax is imposed. As a Bangladeshi clothesmaker and exporter, this is shocking news for us. If you look at the socio-economic situation in Bangladesh, you\u2019ll see that less privileged females are mostly making a living from this industry. They will face the brunt if American buyers leave Bangladesh due to this tariff imposed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does all of this mean for the US economy?\n\n\n\n\n\nSeung Min Kim is a journalist with the Associated Press in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tariff rates as high as 34 per cent on China, 20 per cent from goods from the European Union and almost you know no country was spared here and President Trump has been calling this 'Liberation Day.' Liberation from US consumers having to pay for foreign goods. He wants to bring manufacturing back domestically and he thinks this is the right way to do it even though almost every economy says this could really hurt US consumers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Kahn is the Managing Director with Global Macro at Eurasia Group, a firm that aids investors and business decision-makers to understand the impact of politics on the risks and opportunities in foreign markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says new tariffs will bring tremendous uncertainty globally.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "He booted the Dees\u2019 first two goals of the game. From thereon, he was a mere cast member than the leading act. \u201cHe\u2019s a winner. He\u2019s determined. He\u2019s proud,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cHe\u2019s like everyone. He wants to really start to get some positive results. He\u2019s a proud leader of our footy club. All our leaders are like that. Of course he\u2019s going to be disappointed.\u201d Disappointment is becoming commonplace at Melbourne. That they have been a contender as recently as late 2023 fuels hope the first month of this season is a blip, but the reality is they are no longer a good team. Since they beat Geelong on the first weekend of May last year, the Dees have won just five of 19 games \u2013 the win-loss record of a bottom-four side.\n\nThe problems which cruelled their premiership bids of 2022-23 remain. Their forward line and delivery inside 50 is still a mess, only now they no longer have a dominant midfield or a miserly defence living their mantra of contest and defence. They lost the contested ball again. When you take that out of Melbourne\u2019s game they have little else to threaten opponents. Jack Bowes of the Cats is tackled by Caleb Windsor of the Demons. Credit: Getty Images The vaunted trio of Petracca, Clayton Oliver and Jack Viney were rarely at the centre bounce together, if at all. Max Gawn won his duel with Rhys Stanley on points but in previous years it was one of the defining match-ups of the game.\n\nBayley Fritsch is a shell of the player that booted 50-plus goals in 2021-22. Kysaiah Pickett was the Dees\u2019 most dangerous midfielder, but his spark was needed inside 50. They are robbing Peter to pay Paul, but both Peter and Paul remain poor. \u201cFirst game back, I thought he contributed really strongly,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a helluva lot of work to get involved in that midfield group and he\u2019s going to be a huge player as the year goes on.\u201d Geelong\u2019s total of 165 marks, and the differential of 83, is the most the Dees have conceded under Goodwin. The lopsided count was not necessarily reflected on the scoreboard but defending saps energy, and by retaining the ball it prevented the Dees from entering their preferred contest mode. Goodwin was more concerned with what Melbourne did with the ball than without it, but his counterpart Chris Scott spoke with the satisfaction of a man who had seen a plan bear fruit, even if the final number surprised him.\n\n\u201cIf you kick it to [Steven] May all night, you\u2019ll have a difficult night, that\u2019s probably the crux of it,\u201d Scott said. Loading \u201cAs the game went on we felt it got better for us. We thought we were playing pretty well early on, just didn\u2019t get the gap on the scoreboard that we thought we should have \u2013 that always makes you a bit nervous. \u201cThe players\u2019 willingness to really commit to the style we were after, we were impressed by.\u201d Seventeenth with a percentage that betters only Richmond and West Coast, the Dees are giving their rivals a big start. Hawthorn and Brisbane recovered last year, but Melbourne\u2019s game is not in good order.",

    "text": "\u201cWhile uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d Powell told the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing in Arlington, Virginia. US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the larger than expected tariffs increased the inflation risk, potentially for longer. Credit: AP \u201cThe size and duration of these effects remains uncertain \u2026 Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\u201d White House advisers trumpeted the strong employment data, as well as an announcement by Nissan, reported by The Wall Street Journal, that it would pause plans to cut jobs at a factory in Tennessee. At the same time, other car manufacturers began to cut. Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, said it was pausing production at assembly plants in Mexico and Canada and temporarily laying off 900 workers at five US facilities following the tariff announcement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the jobs figures showed \u201cthe economy is starting to roar\u201d and \u201cthe president\u2019s push to onshore jobs here in the United States is working\u201d. Trump continued to project confidence, likening his tariffs and other economic reforms to complex surgery on a sick patient. He indicated there was room for countries to negotiate on the tariffs, saying \u201cthe rest of the world wants to see if there\u2019s any way they can make a deal\u201d. Vietnam had offered to cut its tariffs to zero, Trump said, following what he called a productive phone call with Communist Party General Secretary To Lam. But following China\u2019s retaliation, Trump wrote in an all-caps post on Truth Social: \u201cChina played it wrong, they panicked \u2013 the one thing they cannot afford to do!\u201d China is the US\u2019s third-largest export market led by oilseeds, grain, semiconductors, oil and gas.\n\nTrump\u2019s son Eric Trump posted: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with [Donald Trump]. The first to negotiate will win \u2013 the last will absolutely lose.\u201d In Brussels, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended Trump\u2019s actions despite having been warned by his NATO counterparts that any economic downturn from a trade war could directly affect US allies\u2019 ability to increase defence spending. Loading \u201cWe\u2019re the largest consumer market in the world, and yet the only thing we export is services, and we need to stop that,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe need to get back to a time where we are a country that can make things, and to do that, we have to reset the global order of trade. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say economies are crashing. Markets are crashing because markets are based on the stock value of companies who today are embedded in modes of production that are bad for the United States.\u201d\n\nFrench Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Europe would enact a \u201cproportionate response\u201d aimed at bringing the US to the negotiating table. He said the EU should not \u201creply with the same weapons\u201d, as retaliatory tariffs on US imports to Europe could hit European consumers. Instead, Lombard said Europe was working on a response that could go beyond tariffs to include taxes or regulations to target businesses but not whole sectors. A Downing Street spokesman said the UK would be guided by the national interest and Starmer would calmly continue with preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate. \u201cWhile the global economic landscape has shifted this week, it has been clear for a long time that like-minded countries must maintain strong relationships and dialogue to ensure our mutual security and maintain economic stability,\u201d he said. In the US, early signs of a backlash to the market rout were evident in Congress, where four more Republican senators joined as co-sponsors of a bill introduced by Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democrat Maria Cantwell of Washington. The bill would terminate new tariffs within 60 days unless the US Congress explicitly approves them.\n\nThat followed an earlier bill passing the Senate that would unwind the emergency declaration Trump used to justify tariffs on Canada. However, it was unlikely to pass the House of Representatives. A sustained trade war \u201cwould be a terrible outcome\u201d, says Republican senator and Trump supporter Ted Cruz. Credit: Bloomberg Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas and Trump supporter, said there were \u201cenormous risks\u201d to the president\u2019s tariff strategy. \u201cThe good scenario is other countries freak out \u2026 and in response, other countries come rushing to the White House and say: we want to negotiate a deal and we\u2019re going to dramatically lower our tariffs to US goods,\u201d Cruz said on his Verdict podcast. \u201cIf we\u2019re in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive American tariffs and massive tariffs on American goods and every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome.\u201d",
