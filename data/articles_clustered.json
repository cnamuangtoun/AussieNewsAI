    "text": "King Charles III offered a rare update on his cancer journey in a video message on Friday evening, revealing that he has responded well to treatment and it will be reduced in the new year.\n\nCharles, 77, described the milestone in his recovery process as \"a personal blessing\" before hailing \"the remarkable advances that have been made in cancer care in recent years.\"\n\n\"Today I am able to share with you the good news that thanks to early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to 'doctor's orders,' my own schedule of cancer treatment can be reduced in the new year,\" the British monarch said in a pre-filmed clip for Channel 4's Stand Up To Cancer broadcast, which partners on its annual campaign with the charity Cancer Research UK.\n\nREAD MORE: Apple issues urgent iPhone update after Triple Zero emergency call testing raises concerns \ufeff\n\nKing Charles gives video message update about his cancer journey (Youtube/The Royal Family)\n\nCharles announced he had been diagnosed with cancer in February 2024 after undergoing a prostate procedure.\n\nWhile his treatment is not over, a spokesperson for the King told CNN that \"His Majesty has responded exceptionally well to treatment and his doctors advise that ongoing measures will now move into a precautionary phase.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"This position will be continuously monitored and reviewed to protect and prioritise his continued recovery.\"\n\nIn his video message, which was filmed at his London residence of Clarence House in late November, Charles reflected on learning about his diagnosis.\n\nHe said that he knows it \"can feel overwhelming\" but that he also knows \"early detection is the key that can transform treatment journeys, giving invaluable time to medical teams \u2013 and, to their patients, the precious gift of hope.\"\n\nHe stressed the importance of cancer screening programs and encouraged people to make use of them to catch the disease quickly because \"early diagnosis quite simply saves lives.\"\n\n\"Too often, I am told, people avoid screening because they imagine it may be frightening, embarrassing or uncomfortable. If and when they do finally take up their invitation, they are glad they took part,\" he explained, before highlighting a new national Screening Checker , available online in the UK.\n\nKing Charles III and Queen Camilla meet patients during a visit at the University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre on April 30, 2024 in London. (Getty)\n\n\"This simple tool allows you to check whether you are eligible for breast, bowel or cervical cancer screening. It demystifies the process, answers your questions, and guides you towards taking that crucial step.\"\n\nCharles also said that during his own cancer journey he has been \"profoundly moved\" by what he called \"the community of care\" that surrounds every patient.\n\nHe ended his message with his \"most heartfelt thanks to the doctors, nurses, researchers and charity workers involved in diagnosis and treatment programs, together with my particular good wishes to those for whom they care so selflessly.\"\n\nFriday's message is the latest example of how the British sovereign has made cancer awareness a fundamental part of his public facing work.\n\nHis first official engagement following his diagnosis was in April last year when he visited University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in London, where he met patients and clinicians.\n\nThe King's outing came as he was announced as the new patron of Cancer Research UK. He has also been patron of Macmillan Cancer Support for almost three decades.\n\nHe also sent a deeply personal message to a Buckingham Palace reception in April honoring the work of cancer charities, saying despite the fears that cancer can bring, it can illuminate the best of humanity.\n\nKing Charles III during the 2025 National Service Of Remembrance (Getty)\n\nCharles has been praised for his openness around his diagnosis and raising awareness around it. Caroline Geraghty, senior information nurse at Cancer Research UK, commended both Charles and his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, for sharing their experiences with the disease.\n\n\"He's visited hospitals, he's seen patients, he's visited support centers. He really has kept in touch with people,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"I think he feels, and as do other people, that he's got something in common with them. I think them telling us this also highlights the fact that anyone can get cancer. It doesn't matter who you are.\"\n\nRoyals mark Remembrance Sunday View Gallery\n\nKing Charles has not publicly disclosed the type of cancer he has been receiving outpatient treatment for.\n\nA royal source told CNN last year that the form of cancer detected was not prostate cancer, but did not specify further.\n\nThe spokesperson for the King told CNN on Friday that was because \"the advice from cancer experts is that, in his determination to support the whole cancer community, it is preferable that His Majesty does not address his own specific condition but rather speaks to those affected by all forms of the disease.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear how much longer Charles will require treatment; that would be a matter for his medical team to determine.\n\nFollowing his diagnosis last year, the King briefly stepped away from public facing duties, though he continued to carry out state business.\n\nHe has since returned to a busy diary of engagements and foreign trips.\n\n\"The King has taken great comfort and encouragement from being able to continue leading a full and active life throughout his treatment, while always heeding the advice of his medical team,\" his spokesperson told CNN.",

    "text": "Strata bodies are forcing Australians into bankruptcy almost as much as the tax office, and private schools are also increasingly turning to the debilitating measure to recover unpaid debts.\n\nThat's according to a report by Financial Counselling Australia (FCA) released today, which found the number of people forced into bankruptcy is climbing, and the proportion of creditor petitions that end in bankruptcy has tripled over the last six years, up to 40 per cent.\n\nIt outlined that, while the measure should be used as a final step, many Australians have been declared bankrupt over debts as small as $10,000 \u2013 which can be largely composed of legal and interest fees.\n\nREAD MORE: Major bank hikes fixed rates despite saying more RBA cuts on the way \ufeff\n\nThe rate of Australians being forced into bankruptcy is rising. (Lousie Kennerly)\n\n\"Forced bankruptcy is one of the most serious tools available to creditors and should only be used as a genuine last resort,\" FCA chief executive Dr Domenique Meyrick said.\n\n\"Our report shows that without stronger safeguards and modernised laws, Australians risk losing their homes and livelihoods unnecessarily over relatively modest debts.\"\n\nWhile debt collectors and big banks have largely stopped pursuing bankruptcy over the past six years, other creditors are taking their place.\n\nStrata bodies made up 12 per cent of all cases in 2024-25 \u2013 the same as non-bank business lenders and only marginally less than the Australian Tax Office at 13 per cent.\n\nIn 2020-21, they made up just 2 per cent of cases.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman raped by Tom Silvagni says he violated her body and trust \ufeff\n\nThe number of bankruptcy actions taken by strata corporations has soared in recent years. (Lousie Kennerly)\n\nIn one example, a woman who was unable to work due to the PTSD, anxiety and depression caused by a violent relationship was pursued by her strata for $10,400 \u2013 much of which was legal fees and interest \u2013 although she was able to borrow from friends and eventually avoided bankruptcy.\n\nThe FCA has called for strata bodies to be forced to provide hardship assistance and limit the legal action they take against residents in their buildings.\n\n\"Forced bankruptcy is appearing most in sectors that lack strong consumer protections, including rights to hardship support or fair dispute resolution,\" Meyrick said.\n\n\"Put simply, it's happening where safeguards are minimal.\n\n\"Practical reforms are urgently needed to ensure fairness and consistency in the system.\"\n\nREAD MORE: David Jones hints at return of Christmas tradition next year \ufeff\n\nThe number of private schools pursuing bankruptcy has also escalated, up to 2 per cent of all cases last financial year \u2013 the same proportion as strata bodies in 2020-21.\n\nAlmost half of those matters were from five schools in Victoria: Sirius College, Oakleigh Grammar, Overnewton Anglican Community College, Trinity Grammar School in Kew, and Wesley College Melbourne.\n\nAs with stratas, FCA said hardship assistance should be enshrined in all sectors where the protections don't currently apply.\n\nIt also made seven other recommendations for governments, including that the bankruptcy threshold to be raised from $10,000 to $20,000.\n\n\"These are practical, achievable reforms,\" Meyrick said.\n\n\"They would make the system fairer and more consistent, helping to ensure bankruptcy is used only as a genuine last resort.\"",

(Getty)\n\nWhile the grid used to be under the most pressure on winter nights, things have changed, according to the Grattan Institute's Alison Reeve.\n\n\"The winter evening peak in the old days was just everyone coming home and putting the heating on at the same time,\" she said.\n\n\"Now what it's shifting to is everyone putting the air conditioning on at the same time.\"\n\nAdding more pressure on the grid is an ironic issue with coal generation.\n\nIf it gets too hot, coal plants start to struggle.\n\nAluminium smelters are asked to shut down temporarily rather than cause blackouts elsewhere. (Nine Archives)\n\n\"Coal generators are more likely to break down because they don't cope very well with high heat,\" Reeve said.\n\n\"So when that happens, that can also cause a blackout or a brownout, because you've got such high demand at the same time.\"\n\nWhat is saving most Australians from blackouts is an arrangement with some of the country's biggest users of electricity .\n\nWhen the grid is under too much strain, the major users are asked to switch off.\n\nThe biggest offenders are aluminium smelters.\n\nAustralia has four aluminium smelters that account for 10 per cent of the electricity used in the country.\n\nAluminium smelters are the biggest user of electricity in Australia. (Nine Archives)\n\nThe Tomago smelter on the NSW Central Coast uses as much power as a city of a million people.\n\nAnd high power bills has meant the smelter is now turning to the federal government to keep them open.\ufeff\n\nBut switching them off is an expensive endeavour.\n\nThe smelters run 24 hours a day, and any shutdown is problematic.\n\n\"It doesn't happen that often,\" Reeve said.\n\n\"It's there if we need it.\"\n\nAluminium smelters like this one in Portland use a massive amount of electricity. (Nine Archives)\n\nAnd while rooftop solar panels are helpful for the grid on hot days, it is taking the edge off rather than carrying the load.\n\nSolar panels generate the most electricity around 1pm, but the usual peak time for power usage is about 5pm. By then, the sun has started to set and less electricity is being generated.\n\nSo how can the average punter reduce the risk of blackouts on a hot summer's day?\n\nThe best options are to add a few degrees to the air conditioner, and, obliquely enough, make sure your aluminium cans are getting recycled.\n\nREAD MORE: How each Australian state is doing when it comes to renewable energy",

(AAP)\n\nIt paints a grim picture of life inside the prison's Metropolitan Special Programs Centre, dating back to about 1900.\n\nRafter highlighted how she found a dangerous and dirty environment with hanging points across all areas of the complex.\n\nShe described the cells as \"rundown and small\" and noted they offered little natural light.\n\nTheir size meant they were unable to house wheelchairs and other mobility aids for prisoners with special needs.\n\nRafter was also scathing about the state of the showers in the centre, which had no privacy barriers and poor drainage.\n\nCracked walls and cramped cells were found at Long Bay jail in Sydney by the prison watchdog. (Photo: Inspector of Custodial Services) (Supplied)\n\n\"The damaged and broken tiles in 7-wing were particularly concerning as these showers are used by inmates at-risk of self-harm.\"\n\n\ufeffThe condition and age of the centre meant authorities could not provide a safe environment for prisoners who have mental illness, disability, age and frailty, she said.\ufeff\n\nRafter also brought to attention the poor conditions in two \"mothballed\" parts of the prison.\n\nThe wings were temporarily closed but were supposed to be left in a state that enabled them to be reopened at short notice.\n\nBut the report found after only three months they were \"filthy\", with fur and faeces pointing to stray cats living in them.\n\nPoor ventilation and run-down ceilings were found by inspectors at Long Bay jail in Sydney. (Photo: Inspector of Custodial Services) (Supplied)\n\nInspectors also scrutinised Long Bay's two hospital \ufefffacilities.\n\nThey described one as \"modern, secure, fit for purpose\", but the other housed remand prisoners and \"bore no resemblance to a hospital\".\n\nIn September, the NSW Opposition called for Long Bay jail to be sold off to make room for thousands of new homes\ufeff.\n\nUnder the plan, the site would be bulldozed to build up to 12,000 homes if the Coalition is elected in 2027.\n\nNSW Corrections Minister Anoulack Chanthivong said the government was considering the recommendations of the report and would issue a formal response at a later date.\n\n\"The government has invested $16 million into its anti-ligature program and is prioritising cells that house inmates most at risk,\" he said.\n\n\"The government has also commissioned a Rapid Review into Unnatural Deaths in Custody to systemic issues and recommend reforms to improve safety and wellbeing in custody.\n\n\"We are actively working to reduce all preventable deaths in custody including by improving design and safety across correctional centres.\"",

    "text": "Founded in 1975, when homosexuality was still illegal in Western Australia, Perth's Connections nightclub has seen waves of social change and kept the party going amid recessions and a pandemic.\n\nCo-owner Tim Brown, who has worked at Connections for almost 35 years, said when the club first opened in Northbridge in 1975, it was an \"incredible thing\" for the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\n\"It wasn't the first place that people could go in Perth,\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\"There had been several others along the way, but they were even more underground and incredibly coded in how you got into them, how you had access into them, what you could do in them.\n\n\" Connections was always \u2026 flamboyant in its approach. It really was a chance for people to show out. \"\n\nHuge social change\n\nIn 1975 in Western Australia, homosexuality was not only illegal for men, but it was also an enormous social taboo.\n\nThe front door of Connections in 1975, the year the club opened. (Supplied: Connections)\n\n\"You could lose your job, lose your family, lose a hell of a lot for even being out, let alone being seen in a gay venue,\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\"I started [working here] in '91, there was still a 'no cameras' policy in here, because people couldn't afford to have their photograph taken in Connections Nightclub, even if they weren't gay, because of what that might mean.\"\n\nHomosexuality was decriminalised in WA in 1990, although the age of consent was set at 21. Equalisation of consent ages occurred in 2002.\n\nIn that setting, Connections became a place for people to escape and be themselves.\n\nAn undated photo of people dancing inside the club. (Supplied: Connections)\n\n\"Remember, 1975 was the peak of disco, a time when nightclubs really came into their own,\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\"People going out, getting dressed up, enjoying themselves in that sort of environment with a very hedonistic, free sort of vibe.\n\n\" If you then overlay that over a group of people who are oppressed day-to-day and you let them have a space where they can let loose and be free and be themselves, it's going to be pretty loose. \"\n\nPeople dancing under disco balls. (Supplied: Connections)\n\nCelebrating all kinds of difference\n\nMr Brown said Connections was not only a space that celebrated the queer community, but also a place that accommodated difference within the community, including age, gender and class.\n\n\"In Perth, being a small town, what happened was that the gays, the lesbians, the young, the old, all ended up in the same space together, which didn't really happen in larger cities,\" he said.\n\n\"[In bigger cities] the women would have their own nightclub, there would be a club for young people, there would be a club for all the subcultures that fit within our community.\n\n\"I think that's what marks Connections out as different from many nightclubs and many other places \u2014 it's rooted in that idea that everybody was together, that it celebrates difference, all sorts of difference.\n\n\"Over the years, the goths were here and the punks and all of that. It was a safe harbour for anybody who felt different.\n\n\"I think that's kind of baked into our DNA and something that was born out of necessity in the early days has actually ended up serving us very well into the present day.\"\n\nAn undated photo of Connections at Perth Pride. (Supplied: Connections)\n\nPeople 'got the memo' in the 90s\n\nOver time, Connections changed from a place that people feared being spotted at to one that attracted people from outside the queer community.\n\nA lot of that happened in the 1990s in the wake of the AIDS crisis.\n\n\"The AIDS crisis galvanised us politically, but it also made us visible. We had to stand up and be counted because we were dying,\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\"It was a very dramatic change in our world, but I think the good that came out of that was us standing up and being counted and the general population taking note and then actually realising these guys are really good fun and their venues are really good fun.\n\nA DJ at Connections. (Supplied: Connections/Tobey Black)\n\n\"Furthermore, [the club] always had such a great reputation for music and a great reputation for being really good fun in a 'loose, let your hair down' sort of way.\n\n\"I think there was always an element of the non-gay community that recognised that about Connections and they were always welcome, I just think more people got the memo somewhere in the 90s.\"\n\nLasting 50 years\n\nConnections has survived the ups and downs of Northbridge's popularity, the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple cost-of-living crises, and a tough environment for the hospitality sector.\n\nIt is hard to verify with absolute certainty, but Tim Brown suspects Connections is the longest-running queer club in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe dancefloor at Connections Nightclub. (Supplied: Connections)\n\nFor any hospitality venue, 50 years is an extraordinary achievement.\n\n\"For any business to last 50 years is impressive, for a hospitality business it's amazing, but for a gay nightclub at the end of the earth it's quite incredible,\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\"If you read international media, gay venues all over the world are closing down.\"\n\nAnd in true Connections style, its 50th birthday party has been going on for months, culminating in a big finale on December 13, involving nine DJs and a cabaret throughout the night.\n\n\"We've done a whole series of different events. My favourite was a staff party for the 50 years of Connections staff, and nearly 300 people turned up,\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\"We had a glassie that had worked here on opening night and a manager that had been here in the 80s, it was quite marvellous to see all those layers of people together that was also a way in which we could actually have some conversation.\n\n\"Without doubt, the birthday party itself will probably be pretty manic \u2026 and I don't think we're going to get that much conversation.\"\n\nAn undated photo of a Pride celebration at Connections. (Supplied: Connections)\n\nMr Brown is not sure what the next 50 years will bring.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure why people keep asking me this question: it's like, can I go now?\"\n\nBut he is optimistic that the spirit of Connections, or Connies as it is known to the locals, will go on.\n\n\"I think, particularly in this day and age where people are feeling so disconnected, there is something really tribal about being with a group of people and dancing together, having a night out and having a few drinks and laughing and meeting strangers \u2026 then we're doing something good,\" he said.\n\n\"If we can keep doing that, there's a good chance that this can keep going for another 50 years or more.\"",

(ABC Pilbara: Kelsey Reid)\n\nAs of October 31, the average waiting time for public housing in Roebourne was 117 weeks. Those on the priority list waited 57 weeks.\n\nThe Department of Communities said all housing built in the north-west after 1990 included ceiling fans, air conditioning apertures and insulation, but many homes in Roebourne pre-dated that.\n\nThe department said residents in older homes, such as Ms Forbs-Price, could purchase air conditioning at their own cost with approval.\n\nThose living with a disability or medical condition could apply for air conditioning.\n\nOliver keeps cool in the midday Roebourne heat.

    "text": "The European Union wants to enter uncharted legal territory using billions in Russian assets to fund the Ukrainian economy.\n\nIts proposed \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine would see frozen Russian assets used to prop up Kyiv's ailing economy amid Moscow's invasion.\n\nThe commission argues that the war has imposed heavy costs by hiking energy prices and stunting economic growth in the EU, which has already provided nearly 200 billion euros ($353 billion) in support to Ukraine.\n\nBut it has not been done before, making the outcome of any legal claims difficult to predict, according to experts.\n\nHere's what we know about the proposal, when it will be discussed, and the positions of the key players.\n\nWhat is the EU's plan?\n\nWestern powers immobilised Russia's sovereign assets soon after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nOf the 300 billion euros ($350 billion) in Russian assets, about 210 billion euros are in Europe, mostly in Belgium, where they are held by central securities depository Euroclear.\n\nEU leaders met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in London on December 8.\n\nThese sanctions previously had to be renewed every six months with the approval of all 27 member countries, but on Friday the EU voted to indefinitely freeze Russia\u2019s assets in Europe.\n\nThis ensures Moscow-friendly governments, such as Hungary and Slovakia can't block the sanctions rollover and allow Russia to use the assets.\n\nEU Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa said European leaders had committed in October \"to keep Russian assets immobilised until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused\".\n\nEU Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa says the next step is \"securing Ukraine's financial needs for 2026\u201327\".\n\nThe EU now plans to use the frozen Russian cash to extend a loan of up to 165 billion euros to Ukraine to cover its military and civilian budget needs in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\"Next step: securing Ukraine's financial needs for 2026\u201327,\" added Mr Costa.\n\nThe loan would be paid back by Ukraine only when Russia pays Kyiv war damages, making the loan effectively a grant that advances future Russian reparations payments.\n\nWhen will the loan be voted on?\n\nA vote on the proposal was expected at the EU on Friday afternoon in Brussels, but Belgium, Italy, Malta and Bulgaria argued the decision should be made at next week's EU summit.\n\nEU leaders are now set to meet on December 18 to finalise the details of the reparations loan.\n\nEU proposes using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine Belgium is pushing back on a European proposal to use frozen Russian assets to help financially support Ukraine.\n\nThey plan to resolve remaining problems, which include guarantees from all EU governments for Belgium that it would not be left alone to foot the bill should a potential Moscow lawsuit prove successful.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis said solid guarantees were being put together for Belgium.\n\nBefore that, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Monday, with further European, EU and NATO leaders joining them later, the German government said.\n\nHow has Russia reacted?\n\nRussia has said any plan to freeze its assets would be illegal, and it would fight any plan.\n\nRussia's central bank has already launched legal action against Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial institution, which holds a large amount of Moscow's assets.\n\nThey are arguing in a Moscow court that Euroclear undertook damaging actions, which had affected its ability to dispose of its funds and securities.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin led a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. (Reuters: Sergei Ilnitsky)\n\nEuroclear has been subject to Russian lawsuits in Moscow courts since the EU froze the assets in 2022.\n\nIn a statement, the central bank described wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine as \"illegal, contrary to international law,\" arguing that they violated \"the principles of sovereign immunity of assets\".\n\nBut economy commissioner Dombrovskis brushed off the suit, saying that the decision is \"legally robust,\" and that he expects Russia \"to continue to launch speculative legal proceedings to prevent the EU from upholding international law\".\n\nWho else might challenge a 'reparation loan'?\n\nHungary, Slovakia and Belgium could also challenge such a loan.\n\nHungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine, but Friday's decision prevents them from blocking the sanctions rollover and makes it easier to use the assets.\n\nLoading...\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said on social media that it meant that \"the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe's leaders are placing themselves above the rules\".\n\n\"The European Commission is systematically raping European law. It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn't winnable,\" he wrote.\n\nHe said that Hungary \"will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order\".\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe (AP: Alexander Nemenov)\n\nIn a letter to Mr Costa, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that he would refuse to back any move that \"would include covering Ukraine's military expenses for the coming years\".\n\nHe warned \"that the use of frozen Russian assets could directly jeopardise US peace efforts, which directly count on the use of these resources for the reconstruction of Ukraine\".\n\nBelgium, where Euroclear is based, is also opposed to the \"reparations loan\" plan.\n\nIt says that the plan \"entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,\" and has called on other EU countries to share the risk.\n\nBelgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico, will discuss the reparations plan next week. (AP: Geert Vanden Wijngaert)\n\nBelgium's Prime Minister Bart de Wever says he fears being \"buried in litigation\".\n\nHe has repeatedly expressed concern that Brussels may be left on the hook to repay Russia in the event of a successful claim and wants all EU countries to participate.\n\nTo spread the risk of Russian retaliation, Belgium also wants other G7 countries holding Russian sovereign assets, such as Britain, Canada and Japan, to replicate the EU scheme.\n\nReuters/AP",

    "text": "Mick Shorter first came to Australia's gold mining capital of Kalgoorlie-Boulder as a teenager looking for a job.\n\nThe week before his 18th birthday, he started labouring as a driller's offsider.\n\nDecades later, puffing on a cigarette while working the controls of a drill rig, he is at the coalface of a modern-day gold rush.\n\n\"I like it because you're out in the bush, you're playing in the mud,\" he said.\n\n\"It's like you're a little kid. I never grew up.\"\n\nMick Shorter behind the controls of a drill rig. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nJust 25 kilometres east of Kalgoorlie's Super Pit gold mine, Mr Shorter and two young offsiders are drilling for riches that have made WA's Goldfields region famous around the globe since the 1890s gold rush.\n\nWith the metal trading near record highs, surpassing $6,000 an ounce in Aussie dollar terms for the first time in October, it is no surprise that gold exploration has surged 45 per cent in the past year.\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), $431 million was spent on gold exploration in the September quarter, up from $297 million a year ago.\n\nA drill rig tests for gold beneath the surface. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nAs more capital flows to junior exploration companies in the hunt for gold, Mr Shorter said the drilling industry was facing labour shortages, especially for experienced drillers.\n\n\"It's exciting times for Kalgoorlie \u2026 it's been pretty busy, and it's getting busier,\" he said.\n\n\"Because there's so much work on at the moment, there's a shortage of workers, but there's also a shortage of drillers because there haven't been so many come through the ranks over the years.\"\n\nRoadside signs point to the location of working drilling rigs. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nFinding the golden goose\n\nWhile Mr Shorter has spent the past 30 years drilling for gold and other minerals, he has never actually seen the yellow metal.\n\n\"Thirty years I've been doing this, and I've never seen any gold,\" he said.\n\n\"It's obviously there, but I've never seen it in any samples.\n\n\"You can tell what sort of rocks are good, that might host them [gold deposits], so when you find quartz and stuff, yeah, you're pretty happy.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nIn most cases, gold is not visible to the human eye and requires scientific analysis in an assay laboratory.\n\nEdward Mead, a veteran geologist and director of ASX-listed gold explorer Riversgold, said the results were crucial for planning the next phases of exploration, or more simply \"where we put the next drill hole\".\n\n\"Six months ago, getting assays through the local laboratory would take 10 to 14 days. Now that's out to five to six weeks,\" he said.\n\n\"So if assay labs are an indication of how the industry is going, then absolutely, there has been an uptick in activity.\"\n\nEdward Mead and David Lenigas from Riversgold at the company's Northern Zone project. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nCash flows to gold\n\nIt has been a remarkable year for gold. The London-based World Gold Council tracks the metal's trade and says there have been more than 50 all-time price highs set.\n\nThe rapid rise helped drive investment in Australia's mineral exploration sector overall in the September quarter, with $3.49 billion representing the strongest quarter since tracking began in 2013.\n\nDrilling samples are sent off to laboratories for testing. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nBDO Australia's global leader for natural resources, Sherif Andrawes, said gold attracted the lion's share, with 21 ASX-listed gold exploration companies raising a combined $552 million.\n\n\"The gold price is strong and has been for a while now, and I think most people believe it will remain strong for some time,\" he said.\n\n\"Mines of the future take a long time to develop, we're talking 10 to 15 years, so when money isn't coming into the exploration sector, that just puts those mines further away.\n\n\"The more money spent on exploration, the more likely they are to find something, so it's a healthy sign for the industry.\"\n\nGold from the Devon mine is poured at Coolgardie's Greenfields Mill. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nRecord gold prices have resulted in increased profitability for existing producers and old mines have suddenly become viable again.\n\nIn the case of the Devon mine, near Laverton in WA's northern Goldfields, trucking ore 283km from the mine to Coolgardie's Greenfields Mill for processing has become an economic proposition.\n\nMatsa Resources executive chairman Paul Poli said this year's price surge was \"beyond anyone's wildest dreams\".\n\n\"The increase in the gold price has brought the Goldfields alive,\" he said.\n\nPaul Poli holds the first gold bar produced at the company's Devon mine. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\n\"When we first contemplated putting Devon into production, we were working on a gold price of $3,500 an ounce.\n\n\"It doesn't get any better than this ... people are predicting $10,000 an ounce in the future. Are we going to see that? God knows.\n\n\"But where we are today has meant an abundant amount of employment opportunities, a huge amount of new gold production, and Devon is just a classic example of that.\"",

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe 31-year-old had undergone an intense two-month camp in Miami training under Diaz.\n\nBermudez also had a dig at Diaz, who is expected to arrive a day before Tszyu's career make-or-break showdown.\n\n\"Pedro Diaz is probably a really, really good amateur coach,\" Bermudez said.\n\n\"He has a lot of knowledge about boxing. He always gets hired and then gets fired. That's his career.\n\n\"Switching trainers is probably a detriment to his [Tszyu] career right now.\n\n\"No way you can develop chemistry that quick with someone.

It's going alright.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Innisfail men said they gained their commercial fishing licence about five years ago.\n\n\"I rang [Adam] and said, 'We've got a licence, let's do it,' and he said, 'Alright, sounds fun,'\" Josh said.\n\n\"It's taken five years to build it up to where it is now that it's feasible.\"\n\nNow they supply line-caught fish to local markets and a retail outlet on the Gold Coast.\n\nThe brothers go fishing whenever they can get spare time.

    "text": "It would be easy to be dismissive of the events that took place at Brisbane's Valley Pool on Friday night.\n\nIn fact, so much of it will have been completely alien to anyone who has watched competitive swimming before \u2014 not least the music blaring out from a DJ set up on pool deck.\n\nMystery medleys. Fans voting for start orders in relays. Powerplays.\n\nGimmicky? Yeah, maybe.\n\nHugely entertaining? Absolutely.\n\nBilled as swimming's foray into the T20 sporting entertainment world, fans were treated to a spectacle of epic proportions in Brisbane, as some of swimming's biggest names danced and laughed their way through an innovative program of events.\n\nThe format was designed to thrust the sport into the entertainment space as much as to sharpen the swimmers' competitive instincts.\n\nNot many swim meets have a DJ on pool deck pumping out tunes all night. (Supplied: Swimming Australia/Delly Carr)\n\nTaking the competition out of one of the traditional pools no doubt helped too.\n\nThe Valley Pool's more intimate setting amongst the palm trees and high-rises added an enthusiasm that not even the squalls of rain that swept across the pool could dispel.\n\nAnd as much as the athletes enjoyed themselves on pool deck, any notion that this was just a meaningless kick about was quashed in the very first event.\n\nA fans' choice mixed 4x50m relay, that saw teams named and then supporters decide whether it was to be a straight 4x50m freestyle relay or in medley order \u2014 the vote was for a medley \u2014 saw Cam McEvoy mowing down Dutch world champion Marrit Steenbergen, making up at least a 10-metre deficit, to get the 1,000-plus supporters up on their feet from the outset.\n\nThe swimmers were enjoying the festival atmosphere as much as the punters. (Supplied: Swimming Australia/Delly Carr)\n\n\"Trust me, these athletes are nervous \u2014 they want to perform,\" Dolphins head coach Rohan Taylor told ABC Sport on pool deck, almost shouting over the pumping music and air horn that signified the taking of a power play.\n\n\"By having the novelty events you're taking away the certainty of their normal structure.\n\n\"You're putting the athlete in an unfamiliar space. They're usually process-driven, really methodical. This is just tearing it away from them.\n\n\"You don't know what's going to happen. Look at that first relay. Who'd have thought Cam would go 20.2 and swim over the top. And all of a sudden it lifted the crowd up.\"\n\nCam McEvoy's superb final leg in the mixed 4x50 relay opened the competition with a bang. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nThis is not a new idea.\n\nSkins races have long been a part of training events, ever since the Qantas Skins event in Sydney in 1996, with the short-lived International Swimming League also playing around with the format as a way to shake up the perceived monotony and staleness of traditional swimming competitions.\n\n\"It's always been in my head,\" Taylor said of the format.\n\n\"I just looked at the past and said, what sort of things worked really well and how do I pull them all together, ultimately with the aim of getting the fans to feel like they're a part of it, bringing them in close, letting them vote on things.\"\n\nTaylor said they presented the format to Channel Nine last year to show that it could work and, with a couple of tweaks, the Australia vs The World format was born.\n\nAnd yes, there is a degree of gimmick about it.\n\nBut as Taylor said, the swimmers were fully into the competition aspect of the events.\n\nAnd the coaches were fully invested too. Dean Boxall hit the Australian team's powerplay button with all the theatricality and enthusiasm of one of his beloved mid-90s wrestlers.\n\nEffusive showman Dean Boxall was in his element. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nIt was sporting entertainment at its very best.\n\n\"It's awesome,\" sprint king Cam McEvoy said.\n\n\"I think it's definitely somewhere the sport is trending.\n\n\"As someone who's been around for a long time now, seeing freshness within the competition landscape is really exciting. It's cool that Australia is taking the first step forward with this.\"\n\nCam McEvoy is a staunch advocate for the format. (Supplied: Swimming Australia/Delly Carr)\n\nMcEvoy, no stranger to innovation with his training methods, said that Swimming Australia should not stop at this, adding more competitions around the country to make a series out of the format.\n\nAnd he said that there was clearly an appetite for it among swimmers.\n\n\"Getting the team that they have for the world team to come out this way for this time of year is impressive, and I think the calibre of who have come out for it shows that the format is needed, people are looking for this within the sport,\" McEvoy said.\n\n\"You could make a full series out of it, you could have teams \u2026 I think the world would get around it.\n\n\"For Australia to be the ground zero for unearthing that and putting that out in the world of swimming is really exciting.\"\n\nSwimmers watch the mystery medley, where every swimmer swam the four strokes in a different order, with interest. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\nGetting competitors to come to Australia was not a problem.\n\nSwimmers from 11 countries made up the 24-strong international team: from New Zealanders like world champion Erika Fairweather, Brits like Olympic champions Duncan Scott and Tom Dean, Dutch world champion Marrit Steenbergen and Egyptian star Abdelrahman Elaraby.\n\nNone needed second invitations.\n\n\"Not a lot, in all honesty,\" Elaraby told ABC Sport when asked how much incentive he needed to fly out for the event.\n\n\"It's really good for the sport.\n\n\"It's the newest thing we have right now \u2014 it's great fun to watch. I really hope it does its job around the world.\"\n\nA packed crowd enjoyed the competition immensely. (Supplied: Swimming Australia/Delly Carr)\n\nAnd the Aussie athletes loved it too.\n\n\"It's fun doing it in a different format,\" Lani Pallister, who swam in a 400m event where the leader after each 100 earned points, as well as for the overall win, told ABC Sport.\n\n\"I think this is more about racing and getting points for the team. For me, it's more fun cheering for the rest of Australia and getting the win as a group.\n\n\"It's been so much fun. Everyone is staying in the same hotel and hanging out for the past few days, it's been really cool.\n\n\"I think it gives us an opportunity to race for the sake of racing, it's almost like a training event for us.\"\n\nPallister who, when time allows, also competes in surf-lifesaving events, said it was great to see swimming take some of those lessons on board.\n\nThe crowd of over 1,000 people were into it at poolside. (Supplied: Swimming Australia/Delly Carr)\n\n\"I think surf lifesaving does an incredible job of making it a show and making it a broadcast,\" Pallister said.\n\n\"It's cool that swimming has taken this concept on board, where there are more variables involved too.\"\n\nNew Zealand's former 400m world champion Fairweather, who underlined her commitment to competing by essentially flying in and out for the event, said she would never miss the chance to compete and was enthused by the format.\n\n\"I think it's an exciting meet for spectators, but it's also exciting for us,\" she said.\n\n\"I love any high-quality racing I can get close to home \u2026 anything I can get close to New Zealand is good for me.\"\n\nMeg Harris and Sam Short celebrate as Australia beat The World 131-105, but swimming was the real winner.\n\nThe day before the event, Kaylee McKeown told ABC Sport that although swimmers are hugely popular in Australia, staying in the public eye would allow their sizeable achievements to be recognised even more.\n\n\"We're trying to take it in a new avenue,\" she said.\n\n\"There's not really anything like this that's going on in the world at the moment.\n\n\"I'm excited to see what this has in store for the swimmers \u2026 especially leading into Brisbane 2032, it's so important to get a home crowd invested in the sport of swimming.\n\n\"I think we go really unrecognised, seeing as we bring in the most amount of medals.\n\n\"I think with more investing in these types of things and just being in the public eye is going to be really good for us across the board.\"\n\nKaylee McKeown embraced the competitive side of the event. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nThe packed stands and fully invested crowd suggests that swimming is not going to lose its popularity any time soon \u2014 especially with such an impressive group of athletes leading from the front.\n\nBut Taylor noted that it was better to be striking from a position of strength rather than being left chasing the eight ball.\n\n\"I think we're in a good place [as a sport],\" Taylor said.\n\n\"We've got some really high-profile athletes at the moment, the sport has been going really well.

(Wikimedia: Irvan Ary Maulana)\n\nMatcha's popularity has surged over the past couple of years, and Japanese farmers have struggled to meet growing demand.\n\nQuickly bolstering supply is not an option.\n\nGreen tea plants take about five years to grow and the process to make the powder is painstaking, requiring farmers to shade the plants about three weeks before harvest, to boost chlorophyll and amino acids.\n\nAfter harvesting, the leaves are steamed for 10 seconds, air-dried, then ground using traditional stone mills, which produce just 40 grams an hour.\n\nMatcha labelling is almost completely unregulated, and some Japanese producers are worried that unscrupulous producers in China are exploiting the growing demand by offloading inferior tea products mislabelled as Japanese matcha.\n\nWhile anyone can make matcha, these producers claim some of the labelling or packaging they are seeing overseas copy famous Japanese brand names or falsely claim to be from Japanese tea-growing regions.\n\nMatcha is made from the same plant as most tea, Camellia sinensis, but the leaves undergo a unique process. (ABC News: James Oaten)\n\n\"Manufacturers work tirelessly to supply consumers with premium products,\" Mr Nonomura said.\n\n\"Yet these efforts are now being undermined by counterfeit issues.\"\n\nMatcha popularity 'gratifying to see'\n\nMatcha is a highly specialised green tea, with its origins in Japan dating back at least 400 years.\n\nIt recently exploded in popularity on social media, as consumers praised its health benefits, rich umami flavour, and gentler caffeine hit when compared to coffee.\n\nMatcha is a highly specialised green tea with its origins in Japan dating back at least 400 years. (ABC News: James Oaten)\n\nIt's now common in lattes, cakes, and ice creams across cafes worldwide, but it's not the first time demand has boomed.\n\nThe first matcha shortage took place in the 1990s, when ice-cream maker Haagen-Dazs launched its green tea flavour in Japan.\n\nThe industry was hit again when Starbucks started serving matcha lattes in the 2000s.\n\nThe renewed popularity has been a boon for farmers like Jintaro Yamamoto.\n\n\"It's incredibly gratifying to see that Japanese culture, or these enduring historical traditions, are being recognised by people around the world,\" he said.\n\nUji is one of Japan's most prestigious tea growing regions.

(ABC News: James Oaten)\n\nMany farmers are also unsure if matcha's popularity will be permanent or short-lived.\n\nOne worry is that producing more matcha will hurt supplies of other green tea, which Japanese consumers still love.\n\nProspect of counterfeits spreading\n\nIn Uji, one of Japan's most prestigious tea-growing regions, long queues of tourists form outside matcha outlets, with shelves cleared within hours of opening.\n\nBuying from the source continues to be reliable, but Mr Nonomura has been tracking the rise of misleading distributors online.\n\nMatsatsugu Nonomura handles Isuzu's international sales. (ABC News: James Oaten)\n\nSome Chinese packets of matcha available for purchase copy famous Japanese product names and packaging, while others falsely claim to be from Japanese tea-growing regions like Uji.\n\n\"If consumers buy something believing it to be Uji matcha and find it not nearly as delicious as expected, there is a risk they will stop buying it,\" he said.\n\n\"The prospect of such counterfeits spreading not just in China but worldwide would be extremely damaging to the market.\"\n\nJapan's agriculture department said the rise of counterfeit products had increased with the rise of matcha's popularity, but it was impossible to provide a specific number.\n\nTackling the problem is also difficult.\n\nThe word \"matcha\" cannot be trademarked, but phrases like \"Uji matcha\" can be.\n\nJapan's Ministry of Agriculture pushed to have such trademarks registered overseas and believed it had some success lobbying China to crackdown on misleading products.\n\nMatcha is made from dried and de-veined green tea leaves that are ground into a fine powder. (ABC News: James Oaten)\n\n\"We understand there have been instances, for example, where a Chinese company unrelated to Uji applied to register the trademark 'Uji Matcha' in China,\" said Tomoyuki Kawai, from the ministry's tea division.\n\n\"But the Chinese authorities rejected it.\"\n\nBut he accepted, even if one misleading product is caught, more will appear later.\n\n\"It is true that we can only deal with each case as it arises,\" he said.\n\nMatcha's surging popularity has led to worldwide shortages of the fine powdered tea. (ABC News: James Oaten)\n\nThe relationship between China and Japan is in a downward spiral, after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi implied Japan would get involved in a conflict over Taiwan.\n\nChina has its own rich history of producing green tea, but matcha originates from Japan.\n\nMr Nonomura said if Chinese producers wanted to make matcha, they must be honest about its branding.\n\n\"China should compete with its own brand names if it claims to have quality products,\" he said.\n\nThe ABC reached out to the China National Intellectual Property Administration and did not get a response.",

    "text": "On day one of Australia's social media ban, my 13-year-old son said the most unexpected thing.\n\n\"It's a good start \u2014 but it doesn't go far enough.\"\n\nThis from the kid who, like so many of his peers, had been rolling his eyes at the \"lame\" attempts by the federal government to restrict what has become open access by predators to kids on almost every social media and messaging site.\n\nWe are three days in now from Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and TikTok being required to remove accounts held by users under 16 years of age in Australia and prevent those teens from registering new accounts.\n\nPlatforms that do not comply risk fines of up to $49.5m.\n\nLoading...\n\nA relief to any parent\n\nThe kids are not restricted from viewing content on sites like YouTube, but they can't sign up for their own accounts until they are 16.\n\nHighly criticised online gaming platforms like Roblox are also required to implement facial age assurance tests, and my son noted that this was in place and was smartly executed. Chat restrictions were immediately obvious.\n\nThis can only be a relief to any parent, even to the ones whose younger teens are anguished at being locked out of their preferred messaging platforms.\n\nThe day the snap streaks ended \u2014 for some teens, at least After a year of waiting, Australia's world-leading laws to block kids from accessing social media are officially enacted. But the teens they're meant to impact say not much has actually changed.\n\nBut parental responses have been as varied as their kids are furious. Some parents have gone on the record saying they will help out their kids with VPNs and fake accounts, so their kids aren't \"left out\". Lesser-known messaging services are being downloaded by kids, and possibly parents, to link them in with a hyper-connected world they can no longer imagine doing without.\n\nI understand the impulse. Teens are impressive advocates for their causes.\n\nBut, despite my own scepticism over the effectiveness of this law, it's been heartening to see young teens respond warmly to what is a positive statement of protection and care \u2014 and I think we underestimate the force of that.\n\nThe power of the loving boundary\n\nFrom infancy, parents are told about the importance of attachment and presence: of ensuring that a child knows its needs are seen and will be met, and that being around their parents is safe.\n\nBecause our teens are mouthy, critical and opinionated young souls yearning to be free of our boundaries, I think we can underestimate the central nervous system calming that comes with knowing that boundaries, even resented ones, are being placed with care and safety around the kids we love.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads in your inbox Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.\n\nGrace Tame gets it. The steely former Australian of the Year, author and child sex abuse victim advocate posted to Instagram when the law came into place, noting that the internet gave direct access to children and that \"child sex offenders are usually the earliest adopters of new technologies, which they repurpose for harm\".\n\nAnything we can do to restrict access is important, she says.\n\nThis is where we parents should remind ourselves of the power of the loving boundary: not to bind and constrain, but to properly demonstrate that we hold our kids and their safety in our mind, and that they do not slip out of our mind.\n\nAnd that's what this might just turn out to be. Not a watertight seal of safety against predators. Nor an onerous restriction of business of the tech giants. But a good first step.\n\nKeep an eye on the shortcuts\n\nJonathan Haidt, the author of the book The Anxious Generation, and a powerful critic of young people having access to phones, is a huge fan of the change. He calls it \"the most vital law on the planet\" and says it doesn't matter if the rollout is messy and imperfect \u2014 \"the alternative is far worse. Without action, we leave yet another generation to grow up under the rule of a handful of tech companies whose business models depend on capturing as much of children's time and attention as possible.\"\n\nIn this household, we will try to keep an eye on the shortcuts, contain the resentments and, probably most important of all, try to lead by example by putting our phones away, turning off the messages and reconnecting in the most essential and powerful way: in person.\n\nThis weekend, we're joining post-natal mums to the ban, too \u2014 have a look at the research on what screens postpartum can do to an under-slept mum.\n\nHave a safe and happy weekend, and given this is my last column before Christmas, I should share really the only Christmas song that truly gets me \u2014 and of course it's sung by one of the great rock and roll voices. Have a wonderful celebration if you celebrate, and a great break if that's on your list, too. I'll catch up with you for some best reads of 2026 before we hit the new year.

(ABC News: Bill Ormonde)\n\nWhile the support was a great boost for the family, services were largely delivered through telehealth or required long commutes.\n\n\"[Alice] was more of a face-to-face person \u2026 so I think she did suffer a little bit from that,\" Mr Wilkinson said.\n\n\"I used to take her to see her therapist on the coast and think, 'Having to travel 600 kilometres to help your kids out is just wrong.'\"\n\nTrevor Wilkinson says he will always miss his daughter.

We tried, and it [wasn't] helping,\" Ms Wilkinson said.\n\nIn an attempt to secure further support for Alice, Ms Wilkinson started investigating a possible ADHD diagnosis for her daughter.\n\nAlice Wilkinson was very close with her mum Edie-Lee Wilkinson. (Supplied: Edie-Lee Wilkinson)\n\nAlice's mental health declined and the family secured a mental health plan through a GP, before being referred to a psychologist and paediatrician to obtain an assessment and for increased medication.\n\n\"That was in hope of looking into ADHD, but we didn\u2019t get her there,\" Ms Wilkinson said.\n\n\"I think it wouldn't have made any difference because she'd already come to the conclusion that nobody could help her.\"\n\nBanding together for Alice\n\nRoyal Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatrists youth psychiatry chair Daniel Pellen said access to psychiatry in remote communities was an ongoing issue.\n\nDaniel Pellen says neurodiverse people in rural areas face an uphill battle to access care.

    "text": "Sensor Dynamics founder Nick Parker said the technology, which had been trialled for the past 18 months, is further advanced from that used on regional highways in NSW or around Sydney\u2019s Port Botany. He said that during the trial of the cameras in Melbourne\u2019s inner west, he was shocked at the size and frequency of heavy vehicles using suburban streets. \u201cYou have got lovely residential streets with semi-trailers coming down them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really no good at all.\u201d Information about trucks detected by the AI-powered cameras will be accessed by the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. Images captured by the cameras will be analysed by roadside AI and transmitted to an Equinix data centre in Melbourne which the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator, the agency responsible for regulating and licensing all vehicles with a mass exceeding 4.5 tonnes, will access through a secure portal. Parker said information from the cameras would not be uploaded to the cloud or shared with offshore databases.\n\nLoading While the $10.2 billion tunnel project is the headline-grabbing change to Melbourne\u2019s freight industry and roads in the western suburbs, Horne said the government\u2019s decision to lease 29 hectares of the old Melbourne Markets site on Footscray Road for a truck marshalling and container storage facility would also reduce the amount of driving time trucks spend returning empty containers to the port. Most of the container trucks which currently rattle through the inner west are loaded with empties. Horne said the proliferation of 26-metre high-performance freight vehicles (HPFVs) on Melbourne roads and disruption to global freight and logistics caused by the pandemic, as well as how goods are warehoused, had significantly changed the logistics of Melbourne\u2019s freight task from what was envisioned when the tunnel project was first proposed. In 2014, there was just one HPFV registered in Victoria compared to more than 5700 today. The HPFVs, which weigh more than 68.5 tonnes, are too heavy to use the West Gate Bridge.\n\nHorne said Melbourne\u2019s population growth was adding pressure on to the city\u2019s warehousing capacity, as there was an estimated 4.5 square metres of additional warehousing space required for every new resident. \u201cYou can see that through the volumes coming through the port,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had their biggest year last year with 3.2 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) and that trajectory is continuing to grow. Victorian Ports and Freight Minister Melissa Horne. Credit: Joe Armao \u201cThat is symptomatic not only of our growing city but that disruption that happened in the supply chain. That hasn\u2019t been a Victorian phenomenon. It\u2019s a global phenomenon.\u201d The idea of a second major road crossing over the Maribyrnong River and dedicated truck routes to the port was first proposed in 2008 by the East-West Link Needs Assessment group chaired by Sir Rod Eddington. In the proposal, daily truck movements in and out of the port were forecast to either double or more than triple from 9000 to between 18,500 and 29,500 by 2035.\n\nThe changing nature of Melbourne\u2019s truck fleet to much bigger vehicles capable of taking more containers has meant that, even though the amount of freight coming into the city has steadily grown, the number of daily truck movements is largely unchanged. The Port of Melbourne, in its soon-to-be published Port Development Strategy for the next 30 years, forecasts truck traffic to and from its docks will grow at between 2 and 3 per cent a year. The government\u2019s most recently published Victorian Freight Plan predicts the freight task to grow faster than the city\u2019s population and more than double between 2020-21 and 2050-51. Sir Rod Eddington in 2020. He says the top recommendations to Melbourne\u2019s transport system he made in 2008 have been realised. Credit: Jason South Eddington said the West Gate Tunnel, despite years of political disagreement about the project, had delivered both the east-west road crossing and key elements of the truck action plan recommended in his report. When added to the Metro Tunnel, which opened this month, the Regional Rail Link built a decade ago and electrification of the Sunbury rail line, the opening of the West Gate Tunnel means the top five recommendations from the seminal Investing in Transport report have been realised.\n\nEddington said that eventually, the final piece of the east-west road project \u2013 a tunnel connecting City Link and the Eastern Freeway \u2013 would need to be built to take pressure of the Domain and Burnley tunnels. Loading \u201cIf you take the Burnley and Domain tunnels out of Melbourne\u2019s infrastructure tomorrow, the city would be gridlocked,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is, you have got to do north of the city what we have done south. It will improve liveability substantially because it takes traffic away from key parts of metropolitan Melbourne and gives much greater certainty to travel times.\u201d Horne, when asked whether she agreed, said the picture would become clearer over the next five years once the North-East Link road project was completed, the Beveridge Intermodal Freight Terminal built north of Melbourne and greater rail capacity to the port established. \u201cGovernments into the future will be able to say, \u2018What else do we need to do in moving thing around the network?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cUnless we are doing it efficiently and driving productivity, the city grinds to a halt.",

    "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s bells everywhere from the goats and the cows, and they made that as their trophy, and we happened to sign it \u2013 and we\u2019re happy that we did.\u201d Welcome to the weird, wonderful world of curling \u2013 which, for the uninitiated, is essentially lawn bowls on ice, with brooms, infused with intricate chess-level tactical nuance. Dean Hewitt and Tahli Gill in action at Beijing 2022. Credit: Getty Images Signing a goat was an experience Hewitt and Gill won\u2019t forget. But they are keen to create further memories, in pursuit of a far more orthodox sporting prize: an Olympic medal. Hewitt, 31, and Gill, 26, have been on a roll. Last season, they finished top five in every event they competed in bar one. This season, the Australian duo claimed gold at another competition in Bern, won silver medals at both the Colorado Cup and Stirling International, while in May, they collected bronze at the world championships in Canada \u2013 the first by any Australian curler in history at that level, although they did fall agonisingly short of direct Olympic qualification.\n\nTheir run of results was enough to boost them to the world No.1 ranking in mixed doubles curling last month; they\u2019ve since slid to No.9, but should they clinch an Olympic berth at the final qualification event in Kelowna, Canada, which runs between December 13-18, they are expected to be in the mix for a medal at Milano-Cortina 2026. That\u2019s some feat, given their chosen sport \u2013 the origins of which can be traced to a frozen pond in Scotland in 1511 \u2013 barely exists where they\u2019re from. They estimate there are under 200 regular curlers in Australia, whereas a single club in North America or Europe can boast over 1000. Tahli Gill and Dean Hewitt. Credit: AP Modest as their community is back home, they are the faces of it. There are no curling facilities in Australia. It is played on hockey ice, which would be like asking Olympic swimmers to practice in a backyard pool.\n\n\u201cThe ice is bumpy,\u201d Hewitt explained. \u201cIt\u2019s got hills and valleys and things like that \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look like it, it looks very flat, but for curling, it has to be so, so, so flat. And for us to get those conditions, we have to be overseas.\u201d So they spend up to eight months every year abroad, pursuing their dreams, racking up expenses that Hewitt reckons would comfortably sit in the six-figure zone. They\u2019re fortunate they have flexible employment situations: he\u2019s an exercise physiologist who can pick up work in Australia and in Canada, where he is a dual citizen, while Gill is a teacher who does relief work at a school which is very accommodating and understanding of her schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s just what you\u2019ve got to do to be at the top,\u201d Hewitt said. Milano-Cortina wouldn\u2019t be their first Olympic appearance, should they make it. Hewitt and Gill also qualified for Beijing 2022, becoming the first curlers to represent Australia on that stage, but their experience was coloured by the pandemic; they couldn\u2019t mingle with other athletes like at a typical Games, while their efforts to stay COVID-free were so mentally exhausting they say it affected their preparations.\n\nPlus, whatever they tried didn\u2019t work: Gill tested positive while in Beijing, and was only able to compete thanks to a late reprieve from Chinese health officials, which allowed her mere minutes to grab her things and get to the curling venue. Loading Since, and partly thanks to the friendly timezone and television exposure in Australia from the last Olympics, they say general interest in curling has skyrocketed \u2013 and will grow, should hopes for a dedicated rink come to pass. \u201cInstead of people saying, \u2018I don\u2019t really know what that is,\u2019 it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, yeah! I saw that on TV, we had a team,\u2019\u201d Gill said. \u201cWe always see a massive influx of people coming and trying curling and wanting to get into [it]. But the biggest challenge that we have is that \u2026 we don\u2019t have capacity.\u201d",

When you hand a child a wheelchair, it just takes my breath away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former cabinet maker first devised the plan to make and donate wheelchairs, after a trip to Fiji in 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I couldn't believe what the children there were going through without a wheelchair. And one of them that really sticks to my mind is a 14-year-old girl walking around on her hands. We've said, what are you going to do now? And she said, I'm going to town. I've never been to town.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 30 years later Mr La Rance\u2019s project still mass produces robust wheelchairs from dumped and unwanted bicycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The bicycles come in, they get cut up and machined to what we want and then they're all passed down through the line with spray painting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there\u2019s no shortage of raw materials - with estimates up to half-a-million bicycles are discarded every year. Most end up in landfill. At the Surfers Sunrise Wheelchair Trust, skilled volunteers have turned out almost 12,000 wheelchairs, so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've delivered them to 31 different countries all over Asia, Africa, you name it, we've been there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest shipment is bound for Sri Lanka, where catastrophic flooding creates extra hardship for people with limited mobility. Valluvan Thillairajah is a medical student and volunteer with Australian-based charity Vanni Hope, and currently delivering aid to flood victims there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With people who don't have mobility, they're literally unable to get away from it. And a lot of them unfortunately dying and being caught in the destruction, which is yeah really tough.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith many roads and paths destroyed in Sri Lanka, Mr Thillairajah says the generous gift of 121 wide-tyre wheelchairs is most welcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're rough terrain wheelchairs, which are really useful for us because especially in regions like the upcountry, you have to go uphill to get places.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Trust chairman and Gold Coast local Geoff Croad it\u2019s also about keeping unwanted bikes out of landfill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was one building in Surfers [Paradise] that had like 40 to 50 bikes sitting in the basement. So, we're able to pick up 30 this morning, bring them back to the depot. We've probably put through the facility probably 40,000 bikes over the years. We use the back frame of the bike.

    "text": "While some people were building puzzles or baking sourdough to get through COVID-19 lockdowns, Mike Honey started tracking case numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS News he wanted to have a good answer when his grandchildren asked him: \"So, what did you do [during the pandemic]?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFour years later, the data analyst still translates global COVID-19 data into charts that help the public understand the risks of the disease \u2014 from national case numbers to the rise of variant strains worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis work has popped up in everything from news reports to academic research.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd although case numbers are the lowest we've seen , epidemiologists told SBS News they still rely on Honey's work to fill an information void where state departments no longer have the time or resources to share data.\n\n\n\nFor the last four years, Mike Honey has spent several hours a week gathering and publishing vital information about COVID-19. Source: Supplied Paul Griffin, an infectious disease physician and clinical microbiologist from the University of Queensland, said: \"I think it's an incredibly valuable service he's provided.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more, Honey does it all for free in his spare time.\n\n\n\nLooking at the big picture\n\nSoft-spoken and polite, Honey sat down with SBS News to talk about how he became scientists' go-to for COVID-19 information.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explained that being from Melbourne's north-west suburbs meant he lived in one of the first places in Australia to be hit by lockdowns.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an IT specialist stuck at home, he realised it was hard to get information about national case numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the states have a decent report that comes out ... but they are just for that state. There's nothing at the federal level,\" Honey said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo he built a spreadsheet that brought all the case numbers from across the country together in one spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, he posted it online \u2014 first on GitHub, an open-source code-sharing platform, and then \"pretty much everywhere\".\n\n\n\nThe graph shows estimated current COVID-19 case numbers across the country based on cases among aged care staff. Source: Supplied National case numbers aren't the only ones he keeps track of. He also monitors variants , vaccine uptake, and aged care case numbers, and posts case charts for New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't long before epidemiologists started to take notice.\n\n\n\nAn 'incredibly valuable service'\n\nAdrian Esterman, professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, said during the pandemic he was asked to give talks to concerned community groups about variants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe struggled to find enough detail from state health departments to satisfy his audience's questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then I came across a Tweet from Mike that led to his GitHub site, which provided exactly the information I was looking for,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHoney's variant tracker takes publicly available information on cases of people infected with COVID-19 mutations and brings it all together on a world map.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat way, it's much easier to see which variants are growing and where, compared to pages of text on sites like the World Health Organization's COVID-19 variants dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I still give talks on COVID-19, and Mike's is still the go-to website,\" Esterman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffin agrees, and said he still refers to Honey's work \"a few times a week, to be honest\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said that while case numbers are low, the data Honey shares still helps to answer important questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like how we manage our hospitals and healthcare systems, and counsel our individual patients so they have an understanding of the risk,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA legacy in medicine\n\nHoney said his uncle's legacy has inspired him to help out where he can.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis late uncle, Dr Norman Honey, dedicated his life to treating leprosy patients and fighting the disease's stigma. He worked in West Africa before moving to Hong Kong, where he served as chief medical officer.\n\n\n\nNorman Honey (centre-right) after receiving a Member of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth in 1994 for his work treating leprosy patients. Source: Supplied / Mike Honey Though much of the data is now gathered automatically, Honey said he still spends a few hours each week tracking COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while he's taken a few nasty comments on social media here and there, he's been surprised by the public's overall response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of people that say they're glad to see it, and they're hanging on it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after four years, he admits he's looking forward to the day he doesn't have to post an update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a little bit of a weight on my shoulders,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoney is hopeful the new Australian Centre for Disease Control, set to open on 1 January 2026, will take over his work.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the government should pay him for his efforts, Honey laughed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That'd be nice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThen he quickly changed his mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd probably prefer to keep it as my hobby.\"\n\n\n\n",

It has been rejected because it does not meet the promise of the commitment that was given almost two years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Victoria's Minister for Health, Mary-Anne Thomas, speaking after state and territory health ministers rejected the Prime Minister's $20 billion health deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comes after reports 3,050 aged Care patients have been stranded in public hospitals, according to new figures unveiled by states and territories.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis presents a sharp, 25% increase in just three months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bottleneck is collateral damage from a long funding standoff between the Commonwealth and the States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that we are dealing with a aging and growing population. We are dealing with greater acuity and complexity with our patients. It's why we need the promise of the original NHRA delivered that is an increase in the Commonwealth contribution rate, an increase in the growth cap. We need to see these delivered in order for the states and territories to consider a health reform funding agreement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe self-imposed deadline for a new five-year hospital agreement now stands only weeks away.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates and territories say, the federally-funded aged care sector is failing to provide suitable exit points from hospitals, placing an immense and costly burden on state-run health services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Health Minister Mark Butler told ABC Radio National Breakfast that the Federal government wouldn't be giving the states or territories any more money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, I think health ministers know I'm not bringing more money today. I don't have the authority to do that. We caught up last night, including Tim Nicholls here in Brisbane, for an informal dinner where we canvassed a whole range of these issues. They know that our job as health ministers is to narrow the points of difference as far as we possibly can and then recognise that this deal, which is not just about hospitals, it's also covering some very important disability issues around the future of the NDIS. The deal ultimately is going to be landed by First Ministers, by the Prime Minister and the premiers and the chief ministers, particularly that big question of dollars going into hospitals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTasmanian Health Minister Bridget Archer says it's an enormous burden on health systems that are already under intense demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is the responsibility of the Federal government -and whilst they might say, Oh, look, we've got a budget under pressure - States also have budgets that are under pressure, and we are stepping in to continue to provide that support.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Minister for health, Ryan Park shares a similar sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm deeply, deeply furious with what is happening because it's not fair on those patients.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth has been embroiled in a funding clash with the states and territories for months as it tries to secure a new five year public hospital agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese sought to ease those tensions, adding an extra $1 billion to an existing offer of $20 billion over five years, and $2 billion over four years to deal with aged care patients stuck in public hospital beds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dispute stems back to a national cabinet agreement in 2023 when the federal government promised it would increase its share of public hospital funding to 45% by 2035.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut two years later, a deal is yet to be made.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland Minister for Health Tim Nicholls says the chance of a deal this year is unlikely without a largely improved offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is not the Christmas present that Australians are looking for from their Federal government. When it comes to health care reform, we wake up hopeful, but I'm not sure that we'll get there on Friday. That really requires the Prime Minister to come to the table.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Butler says the major cost driver results from state-level decisions, such as wage deals, which the federal government does not control.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Sensor Dynamics founder Nick Parker said the technology, which had been trialled for the past 18 months, is further advanced from that used on regional highways in NSW or around Sydney\u2019s Port Botany. He said that during the trial of the cameras in Melbourne\u2019s inner west, he was shocked at the size and frequency of heavy vehicles using suburban streets. \u201cYou have got lovely residential streets with semi-trailers coming down them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really no good at all.\u201d Information about trucks detected by the AI-powered cameras will be accessed by the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. Images captured by the cameras will be analysed by roadside AI and transmitted to an Equinix data centre in Melbourne which the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator, the agency responsible for regulating and licensing all vehicles with a mass exceeding 4.5 tonnes, will access through a secure portal. Parker said information from the cameras would not be uploaded to the cloud or shared with offshore databases.\n\nLoading While the $10.2 billion tunnel project is the headline-grabbing change to Melbourne\u2019s freight industry and roads in the western suburbs, Horne said the government\u2019s decision to lease 29 hectares of the old Melbourne Markets site on Footscray Road for a truck marshalling and container storage facility would also reduce the amount of driving time trucks spend returning empty containers to the port. Most of the container trucks which currently rattle through the inner west are loaded with empties. Horne said the proliferation of 26-metre high-performance freight vehicles (HPFVs) on Melbourne roads and disruption to global freight and logistics caused by the pandemic, as well as how goods are warehoused, had significantly changed the logistics of Melbourne\u2019s freight task from what was envisioned when the tunnel project was first proposed. In 2014, there was just one HPFV registered in Victoria compared to more than 5700 today. The HPFVs, which weigh more than 68.5 tonnes, are too heavy to use the West Gate Bridge.\n\nHorne said Melbourne\u2019s population growth was adding pressure on to the city\u2019s warehousing capacity, as there was an estimated 4.5 square metres of additional warehousing space required for every new resident. \u201cYou can see that through the volumes coming through the port,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had their biggest year last year with 3.2 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) and that trajectory is continuing to grow. Victorian Ports and Freight Minister Melissa Horne. Credit: Joe Armao \u201cThat is symptomatic not only of our growing city but that disruption that happened in the supply chain. That hasn\u2019t been a Victorian phenomenon. It\u2019s a global phenomenon.\u201d The idea of a second major road crossing over the Maribyrnong River and dedicated truck routes to the port was first proposed in 2008 by the East-West Link Needs Assessment group chaired by Sir Rod Eddington. In the proposal, daily truck movements in and out of the port were forecast to either double or more than triple from 9000 to between 18,500 and 29,500 by 2035.\n\nThe changing nature of Melbourne\u2019s truck fleet to much bigger vehicles capable of taking more containers has meant that, even though the amount of freight coming into the city has steadily grown, the number of daily truck movements is largely unchanged. The Port of Melbourne, in its soon-to-be published Port Development Strategy for the next 30 years, forecasts truck traffic to and from its docks will grow at between 2 and 3 per cent a year. The government\u2019s most recently published Victorian Freight Plan predicts the freight task to grow faster than the city\u2019s population and more than double between 2020-21 and 2050-51. Sir Rod Eddington in 2020. He says the top recommendations to Melbourne\u2019s transport system he made in 2008 have been realised. Credit: Jason South Eddington said the West Gate Tunnel, despite years of political disagreement about the project, had delivered both the east-west road crossing and key elements of the truck action plan recommended in his report. When added to the Metro Tunnel, which opened this month, the Regional Rail Link built a decade ago and electrification of the Sunbury rail line, the opening of the West Gate Tunnel means the top five recommendations from the seminal Investing in Transport report have been realised.\n\nEddington said that eventually, the final piece of the east-west road project \u2013 a tunnel connecting City Link and the Eastern Freeway \u2013 would need to be built to take pressure of the Domain and Burnley tunnels. Loading \u201cIf you take the Burnley and Domain tunnels out of Melbourne\u2019s infrastructure tomorrow, the city would be gridlocked,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is, you have got to do north of the city what we have done south. It will improve liveability substantially because it takes traffic away from key parts of metropolitan Melbourne and gives much greater certainty to travel times.\u201d Horne, when asked whether she agreed, said the picture would become clearer over the next five years once the North-East Link road project was completed, the Beveridge Intermodal Freight Terminal built north of Melbourne and greater rail capacity to the port established. \u201cGovernments into the future will be able to say, \u2018What else do we need to do in moving thing around the network?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cUnless we are doing it efficiently and driving productivity, the city grinds to a halt.",

    "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s bells everywhere from the goats and the cows, and they made that as their trophy, and we happened to sign it \u2013 and we\u2019re happy that we did.\u201d Welcome to the weird, wonderful world of curling \u2013 which, for the uninitiated, is essentially lawn bowls on ice, with brooms, infused with intricate chess-level tactical nuance. Dean Hewitt and Tahli Gill in action at Beijing 2022. Credit: Getty Images Signing a goat was an experience Hewitt and Gill won\u2019t forget. But they are keen to create further memories, in pursuit of a far more orthodox sporting prize: an Olympic medal. Hewitt, 31, and Gill, 26, have been on a roll. Last season, they finished top five in every event they competed in bar one. This season, the Australian duo claimed gold at another competition in Bern, won silver medals at both the Colorado Cup and Stirling International, while in May, they collected bronze at the world championships in Canada \u2013 the first by any Australian curler in history at that level, although they did fall agonisingly short of direct Olympic qualification.\n\nTheir run of results was enough to boost them to the world No.1 ranking in mixed doubles curling last month; they\u2019ve since slid to No.9, but should they clinch an Olympic berth at the final qualification event in Kelowna, Canada, which runs between December 13-18, they are expected to be in the mix for a medal at Milano-Cortina 2026. That\u2019s some feat, given their chosen sport \u2013 the origins of which can be traced to a frozen pond in Scotland in 1511 \u2013 barely exists where they\u2019re from. They estimate there are under 200 regular curlers in Australia, whereas a single club in North America or Europe can boast over 1000. Tahli Gill and Dean Hewitt. Credit: AP Modest as their community is back home, they are the faces of it. There are no curling facilities in Australia. It is played on hockey ice, which would be like asking Olympic swimmers to practice in a backyard pool.\n\n\u201cThe ice is bumpy,\u201d Hewitt explained. \u201cIt\u2019s got hills and valleys and things like that \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look like it, it looks very flat, but for curling, it has to be so, so, so flat. And for us to get those conditions, we have to be overseas.\u201d So they spend up to eight months every year abroad, pursuing their dreams, racking up expenses that Hewitt reckons would comfortably sit in the six-figure zone. They\u2019re fortunate they have flexible employment situations: he\u2019s an exercise physiologist who can pick up work in Australia and in Canada, where he is a dual citizen, while Gill is a teacher who does relief work at a school which is very accommodating and understanding of her schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s just what you\u2019ve got to do to be at the top,\u201d Hewitt said. Milano-Cortina wouldn\u2019t be their first Olympic appearance, should they make it. Hewitt and Gill also qualified for Beijing 2022, becoming the first curlers to represent Australia on that stage, but their experience was coloured by the pandemic; they couldn\u2019t mingle with other athletes like at a typical Games, while their efforts to stay COVID-free were so mentally exhausting they say it affected their preparations.\n\nPlus, whatever they tried didn\u2019t work: Gill tested positive while in Beijing, and was only able to compete thanks to a late reprieve from Chinese health officials, which allowed her mere minutes to grab her things and get to the curling venue. Loading Since, and partly thanks to the friendly timezone and television exposure in Australia from the last Olympics, they say general interest in curling has skyrocketed \u2013 and will grow, should hopes for a dedicated rink come to pass. \u201cInstead of people saying, \u2018I don\u2019t really know what that is,\u2019 it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, yeah! I saw that on TV, we had a team,\u2019\u201d Gill said. \u201cWe always see a massive influx of people coming and trying curling and wanting to get into [it]. But the biggest challenge that we have is that \u2026 we don\u2019t have capacity.\u201d",
