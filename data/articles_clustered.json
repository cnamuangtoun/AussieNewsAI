(Getty)\n\nIn 2024, the number had surged to more than \ufeff29,800.\n\nResearchers also found the \ufeffaverage number of vasectomies performed per month has increased by about 45 per cent, though the figure was much higher in some states.\n\nFor example, in NSW about 25 vasectomies were performed on men aged 18 to 44 per 100,000 male population per month in April 2016.\ufeff\n\nIn December 2024, that figure had jumped to 39 \u2013 an increase of 56 per cent.\n\nIn Tasmania, the number of \ufeffvasectomies were performed on men aged 18 to 44 per 100,000 male population per month rose from 41 in 2016 to 66 in 2024.\n\nThat's an increase of 61 per cent.\ufeff\n\nDr Jack Janetzki, lecturer in Pharmacy and Pharmacology at Adelaide University and co-author of the study, suspects the cost-of-living crisis played a role in the spike in vasectomy rates across the country.\n\n\"Rising housing costs, cost-of-living pressures and delayed partnership formation could all be associated with decisions to limit or forgo childbearing,\" he told nine.com.au.\n\n\"Vasectomy provides a definitive solution to limiting family size amid these pressures and people may now be making concrete decisions on family size at a greater rate.\"\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nIncreasing awareness and normalisation of vasectomy as a safe, effective and relatively simple form of contraception may be another factor.\n\nThere's also greater \ufeffvisibility of male reproductive responsibility now than there was 10 years ago, prompting some men to take on more contraceptive responsibility.\n\nNot to mention that vasectomy is much less invasive \ufeffthan permanent methods of female contraception like tubal ligation.\n\nThe rise in vasectomy rates across the country coincides with a steady decline in Australia's birth rate.\n\nThe nation's total fertility rate (TFR)\ufeff dipped to a record-breaking low of 1.48 in 2024 and is predicted to slip even lower to 1.42 this year, according to The Centre for Population.\n\n\"Vasectomy alone cannot explain Australia's falling birth rate but it likely acts as both a marker and mechanism of fertility decline,\" Janetzki said.\n\nData shows a marked rise in vasectomies in younger men, particularly those aged 18 to 24.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of young women aged 18 to 24 \ufeffgiving birth is declining.\n\nThis suggests young Australians are making decisions to limit fertility and are increasingly open to permanent contraception at younger ages \ufeff.\n\n\"Our findings likely reflect the changing intentions around family size and permanence of reproductive decisions, reinforcing trends towards delayed child bearing, fewer children overall or not choosing to have children at all,\" Janetzki said.",

    "text": "The NRL's reported landmark move to host a State of Origin match in New Zealand has been hailed as \"sensational\" by Kiwi legend Gary Freeman.\n\nIt is understood negotiations between the league and the New Zealand government have culminated in Auckland's Eden Park earning hosting rights for one game of the 2027 series.\n\nThe match at the 50,000-seat stadium will be the first Origin fixture in New Zealand, and the first overseas since an exhibition match in Long Beach, California, in 1987.\n\nNew Zealand did host one match of a Super League Tri-Series that featured the Kiwis, Queensland and NSW in 1997, but Queensland's win over the hosts that day is not considered an official Origin fixture.\n\nFreeman, who played an incredible 46 Tests, said Origin in New Zealand was a \"sensational\" shot in the arm for rugby league, which has boomed across the ditch in recent years.\n\n\"New Zealand needs State of Origin and I am all for it. It will grow the game so much bigger from when us old blokes were playing,\" the former halfback told AAP.\n\n\"It will be a sell-out. I just wish we had a stadium that held 70,000 people because that's what we could get.\n\n\"I don't know that the Aussies will be able to get a ticket. Quote me on that.\"\n\nSince 2018, each Origin series has featured one match in neither NSW nor Queensland, bar the COVID-19-affected 2021 series held across Queensland.\n\nIn 2023, the league allotted neutral Origin games to Melbourne and Perth for each series through 2028, but had left the 2027 slot blank.\n\nChange to rugby league kick-off rule delayed until end of season A proposed rule change to the rugby league kick-off will not be enforced at the start of the 2026 NRL season and will instead be trialled during matches later in the year.\n\nFreeman said it was high time for New Zealand to be included.\n\nRugby league has boomed in New Zealand since the Warriors' return from Australia, where they had been forced to relocate during the pandemic.\n\nThe Warriors had an average crowd of 25,382 at their home games last season, selling out nine of the 11 they played in Auckland.\n\n\"If you look back to what the Warriors did for the game during COVID, this [Origin in New Zealand] should have happened earlier,\" said Freeman, the first Kiwi player to win the Dally M Medal.\n\n\"I took clients to games last year and the atmosphere was unbelievable. It has a State of Origin atmosphere already, so I can't wait for the Kiwis to fill the stadium.\"\n\nThe landmark Origin match comes following pushes for New Zealand to host the NRL's potential 20th team in coming years.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe NRL received three separate bids representing New Zealand's South Island when it last accepted expansion applications in 2024, with none successful.\n\nKiwi players Jamayne Isaako and Jordan Riki have been among the NRL stars to have previously backed the creation of a second NZ team.\n\nFreeman believed the benefits of playing Origin in New Zealand would trickle down to the game's grassroots.\n\n\"Origin is a key to get more kids to play footy over there and they get to see it live and don't have to stay up until midnight to watch it,\" he said.\n\n\"The Warriors and Kiwis have given it another boost, and Origin will take it next level.\"\n\nMelbourne's MCG will be the neutral venue for the 2026 Origin series, followed by Perth Stadium in 2028.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Australians working in Japan's snowfields have been shaken by a spate of recent tragic deaths, but say the industry is safe.\n\nThree young Australians have died in skiing-related incidents in Japan since the start of this year, including two in the past week.\n\nAustralian Matt Guy has lived in Japan for about 10 years and runs ski tours for foreigners.\n\nHe also worked as a safety ski patroller rescuing injured visitors and said Japan's ski slopes could be unpredictable.\n\nMatt Guy says conditions on snowfields are changeable. (Instagram: Matt Guy)\n\n\"Conditions do change on the same day and it doesn't matter how much you're prepared with all the best equipment and technology, nature is pretty powerful and anything can happen,\" he said.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Australian-Indonesian citizen Rylan Henry Pribadi died while skiing at the Niseko Ski Resort in Kutchan Town, Hokkaido on January 9.\n\nHe came into contact with a rope marking the course boundary while on the snow and the cause of death was asphyxiation.\n\nOn Monday this week, 27-year-old Melbourne man Michael \"Micky\" Hurst died after he had a medical episode while skiing with friends in the Hokkaido region.\n\nMichael Hurst (right) was at the rear of a group of skiers in Japan's Hokkaido region when he had a medical episode. (ABC: Supplied)\n\nA day earlier, Sunshine Coast woman Brooke Day, 22, died after riding a ski lift at the Tsugaike Mountain Resort in central Japan when her backpack became caught and she suffered critical injuries.\n\nJapanese media also report another Australian, a 29-year-old man, was seriously injured in late January while back-country skiing in the Hokkaido region.\n\nForeigners in 'significant proportion' of ski accidents\n\nAustralian Ben Kerr is on the tourism board for the town of Niseko \u2014 where two of the Australians died \u2014 and said the community was in shock, but hoped it would not affect visits to the area.\n\n\"Obviously with these kind of tragedies, the tourist boards work very hard to put out information to all of the guests, just telling people to really be careful, to make sure they're skiing together with their friends, they know where they are and that they're carrying the right items if they're going back country or if they're inexperienced, to get a guide,\" he said.\n\n\"Previously we've had Australian guests here who've hurt themselves when they've gone off a big jump and haven't landed very well.\n\nTsugaike Kogen Mountain Resort is a popular ski spot in Japan. (ABC: Kellie Lazzaro)\n\n\"So with skiing, unfortunately comes accidents. We do our best to try to reduce those numbers, but ultimately skiing is a little bit of a dangerous sport, I guess.\"\n\nAustralia makes up the largest cohort of visitors to Japan's snowfields each year, with visits usually peaking each January.\n\nThe head of Japan's National Ski Safety Measures Council Makoto Takayanagi said accidents involving foreigners seemed to be on the rise.\n\n\"Within Hokkaido alone, there were 58 ski-related accidents [in the back country] between November 1, 2025 and February 2, 2026. Of these, 48 involved foreign nationals,\" he said.\n\nAustralian woman Brooke Day died on a ski lift at Tsugaike Kogen Mountain Resort. (Supplied)\n\n\"The current situation is that foreigners make up a significant proportion.\n\n\"When foreign visitors come to Japan to ski, we ask that they consult the ski resort brochures and aerial maps, and carefully confirm that they remain within the designated managed areas of the resort.\"\n\nMr Guy said while skiing in Japan had unpredictable risks, there were ways to be prepared.\n\n\"Just see where you are and gather the information to know that this place is pretty powerful,\" he said.\n\n\"There's signage there to talk about how much snow there is.\n\n\"And then on top of that, I think it makes a lot of sense to go out with guides, to go with people who know the way around.\"",

    "text": "Australian punter Michael Dickson is so good his coach doesn't bother coaching him.\n\n\"I will defer to what he feels best about,\" Seattle's special teams coordinator, Jay Harbaugh, said this week.\n\n\"You don't want to go and say, 'Hey, do this, Mike.'\n\n\"He's so experienced. He's really polished. He knows the situation.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nSydney-born Dickson could become just the second Australian to play in a Super Bowl victory, after offensive tackle Jordan Mailata's triumph with Philadelphia last year.\n\nThe 30-year-old would be the first Australian punter to win the Super Bowl if the Seahawks defeat the New England Patriots in the NFL's showcase game on Monday (AEDT).\n\nDickson is acclaimed as the NFL's best punter. He's certainly the best paid. In June, he signed a $23.25 million, four-year contract extension.\n\nHe's the longest-serving player on the Seahawks' current roster, after being drafted in 2018, and has an unrivalled list of NFL honours for an Aussie.\n\nLoading...\n\nHe was twice an All-Pro (2018 and last year) and made the All-Rookie team (2018).\n\nHe was twice an All-American in college ranks (2016, 2017).\n\nHe won the coveted Ray Guy award for the best college punter (2017).\n\nHe was twice a college special teams player of the year (2016, 2017) and was voted among the Seahawks' top 50 players \u2014 ever.\n\nNone of the accolades for the former Australian rules football player surprise Nathan Chapman.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Chapman told AAP.\n\nHe knew Dickson was something special the moment he joined Prokick Australia, the training academy Chapman formed in 2007, which is now a wildly successful breeding ground for Australian kickers and punters.\n\nMichael Dickson has been with the Seattle Seahawks for eight seasons. (Reuters: Imagn Images/Mark J. Rebilas)\n\nDickson's Prokick try-out was in 2015.\n\nA year earlier, the then 18-year-old was a member of the Sydney Swans' academy but was overlooked at the AFL draft.\n\n\"He was at the Sydney Swans academy so he could play,\" Chapman, who played 76 AFL games for Brisbane and Hawthorn from 1993 to 2000, said.\n\n\"He was thereabouts the mark in the AFL world.\n\n\"So his ability to read the play, feel pressure \u2014 it has been evidently shown that he was actually really good at it.\n\n\"He just might not have come through at the right time to have that AFL career back then.\"\n\nSo Dickson took a gap year from Australian rules football and went to Melbourne to try out for Chapman's Prokick Australia.\n\nSeattle to face New England in Super Bowl LX New England survived a Denver blizzard and Seattle outlasted Los Angeles in an offensive shootout to set up a bumper clash for Super Bowl LX.\n\nDickson's physical traits and kicking ability were evident. But there was something else.\n\n\"His professionalism, dedication and relentless work ethic \u2014 he just didn't stop,\" Chapman said.\n\n\"We knew he could kick a football.\n\n\"And there were some things to learn. His ability to pick it up and then put his own touch on it was really cool to watch.\n\n\"It didn't take long for us to work out that he could play.\n\n\"Hence why we gave him the opportunity at Texas. You don't just walk in there unless you can compete at that level.\n\nChapman said Dickson's 2016 campaign \"was like a whirlwind\".\n\n\"And then, after that, he just dominated,\" he said.\n\nAfter a stand-out 2017 college season, the Seahawks used pick number 149 in the NFL draft on the Australian.\n\nMailata's Super Bowl win one of Australia's great sporting triumphs Jordan Mailata's first experience with the Super Bowl was in 2017 watching Beyonc\u00e9's half-time show. Now he is a champion and completes one of the greatest sporting triumphs by anyone born on Australia's shores.\n\nIn his first NFL season, Dickson appeared in the Pro Bowl \u2014 the annual all-star game \u2014 and collected the first of many gongs.\n\nThe Aussie earned rave reviews not just for his punting, but for an innate tactical nous.\n\n\"That is what has been so impressive about him,\" Chapman said.\n\n\"His ability to see the game and be able to produce so many different kicks under the pressure that he has been under, and deliver at such a high level.\n\n\"They have all got their own craft attached to it, the different kinds of kicks.\n\n\"His ability to see something, in what seems like slow motion, and make the right choice is really impressive.\n\n\"Drop punt kicks, banana kicks, long kicks, short kicks, cross-field \u2014 you name it.\n\n\"It's like a game to him and he loves playing it; it's like a game of 'what are we going to do now to disrupt the opposition'.\"\n\nCan that uncanny ability be taught, or is it inherent?\n\n\"It's a bit of both,\" Chapman said.\n\n\"Confidence comes into that.\n\n\"If you've got a coach who lets you do your thing and you can deliver for him, you build off that.\n\n\"Some coaches walk up and say, 'If you get this wrong, then you're off the team'.\n\n\"There's a real coach-player connection that is needed. You have got to be on the same page.\n\n\"The special teams coaches are in control of the long snap of the kicker, the linemen, the gunners \u2014 there's 11 people all running around.\n\n\"And often the special teams coach has never kicked a ball before in their life.\n\n\"So they look after the structural system to protect you so you can do your job.\n\n\"There's certain nuances that you know as an athlete or a footballer kicking the ball \u2014 what works for distance and hang time and location.\n\n\"They have trusted him. They have never doubted him. And he has paid them back in spades.\"\n\nDickson is now a poster boy for Prokick Australia.\n\nThe academy has six Australian alumni playing in the NFL and between about 80 and 85 in the US college ranks.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nOverall, Prokick Australia was \"in the 400s\" when it came to numbers of alumni granted US college scholarships, Chapman said.\n\n\"When I wrote out a business plan, the business plan that was written was probably where it is now,\" he said.\n\n\"I really thought that we would get 30 to 50 guys scholarships every year.\n\n\"I didn't realise it was going to take 12, 13 years for that to eventuate; I didn't realise how hard it was going to be at the start.\n\n\"So in one sense, yeah, I thought this can be done. It just took 12 years of hard work to be where it is.\"\n\nDickson is the fourth Australian punter to feature in a Super Bowl. The others \u2014 Ben Graham (Arizona, 2009), Mitch Wishnowsky (San Francisco, 2020) and Arryn Siposs (Philadelphia, 2023) \u2014 all played in losses.\n\nThe Eagles' Bankstown-born Mailata is the sole Aussie to play in a triumph in the grandest game in American sport.\n\nOnly one other Australian, Jesse Williams, has a coveted Super Bowl ring. He was on Seattle's roster in 2014 but didn't play that season due to a knee injury.\n\nAAP",

That pushed me away from cricket a bit, but in hindsight I am grateful for the pressure he put on me.\n\n\"That has instilled good ethics in me in the rugby league space and the work ethic to get where I want to get to.\"\n\nMurphy played 13 Tests, which included a career-best 5-73 against Pakistan in 1993, and 12 ODIs.\n\n\"It is definitely a good challenge for me to get to the international level he represented,\" Sebastian said.\n\n\"That is a goal of mine. Having him as my father and knowing he has gone through the professional sporting area, he can guide me along the way.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nSebastian, 22, secured a release from the Knights a year early after conversations with coach Kristian Woolf and senior forwards Tom Gilbert and Saifiti. The culture appealed to him, with Saifiti's words striking a chord.\n\n\"I was with Daniel at Newcastle and I was really close with him and his brother Jacob. They took me under their wing,\" Sebastian said.\n\n\"Daniel is somebody I really trusted and when he told me about how it was up here I really trusted his word. It all felt right and somewhere I could fit in.\n\n\"He is really good with the younger boys who aspire to get to that level in the NRL. He is a great mentor for me.\"\n\nHe arrived at the Dolphins in March 2025, only to suffer an injury blow.\n\nSebastian almost became the forgotten man of the classy forward rotation due to his absence from the field until late-season Queensland Cup games for Norths Devils.\n\n\"It was my first training session when I tore my meniscus. That was pretty disappointing because I was excited,\" he said.\n\n\"I was in rehab for the whole year but managed to get a couple of games in for Norths Devils.\n\n\"I have had a full pre-season and am looking forward to the season ahead.\n\n\"All the boys here got around me and helped me get through that rehab period.\n\n\"Now that I am out the other side I know it was all worth it. I have only played one NRL game and am aspiring to get to that next level.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "US President Donald Trump's Liberation Day, the administration's reciprocal tariffs, and global trade policy chaos have had the new financial year begin with a bang.\n\nBut, at the halfway mark, analysts say corporate Australia has found its mojo.\n\n\"About six months ago, we were expecting that for the financial year 2026 earnings for the overall ASX 200 would grow only by about 3 per cent,\" UBS equity strategist Richard Schellbach said.\n\n\" Now, six months later, the expectations for that full year 2026 earnings growth sits above 10 per cent. \"\n\nLeading the earnings charge is Australia's mining sector, boosted by signs of a stabilisation in the Chinese economy, and a turbo-charged commodities market.\n\n\"We're seeing copper and gold near record highs and that is going to have a really big boost to these companies' margins,\" fund manager Roger Montgomery said.\n\nRoger Montgomery is more pessimistic about Australia's retail sector. (Supplied)\n\nBut it's not just the mining sector shifting up a gear.\n\nSpending on data centres is up, but may be cooling\n\nOfficial data has shown big business spending \u2014 outside the resources sector \u2014 rose 8.6 per cent in the three months to September.\n\nMuch of that has been on cloud computing infrastructure and AI data centres, but NAB director of self-managed super funds and investor behaviour, Gemma Dale, warns the hot money might be cooling.\n\n\"It's an interesting play,\" she said.\n\n\"There is certainly extraordinary growth built into forecasts.\n\n\"But they have perhaps run a bit hard.\"\n\nUBS is expecting companies attached to cloud computing and data centres to underperform in terms of their earnings growth.\n\n\"Look, in terms of the earnings downgrades that we've seen over the last three to six months, tech would be the biggest decelerator in terms of earnings growth,\" Mr Schellbach from UBS said.\n\nShoppers took advantage of the Black Friday sales season late last year as businesses' spending rose. (ABC News: Yiying Li)\n\nWhat about the retail sector?\n\nIt is not just businesses spending up; shoppers hit the high streets to take advantage of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales season late last year.\n\nAnd a UBS consumer report found Australian consumers' spending intentions held at near record levels right up to the end of the calendar year.\n\nHouseholds also told the investment bank they felt their incomes had risen, and they expected further gains to come, which UBS said would help the broader retail sector, including Coles and Woolworths, achieve earnings margins of between 2 and 3 per cent.\n\nWhy it's worth paying attention to reporting season If you've only recently taken the plunge into the share market, this could be your first reporting season. So just what exactly is it and why should you care?\n\n\"Our work indicates that the wealthier households have increased their ability to spend by so much over the last few years that it overall masks the negative impacts which the renting households are facing,\" Mr Schellbach said.\n\nBut the spending has also reignited inflation and led to a Reserve Bank interest rate hike \u2026 with the potential for more to come.\n\nMs Dale said retail stocks like JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman and Wesfarmers could beat half-year earnings expectations but may disappoint investors on their outlooks.\n\n\"What they're looking for potentially is some weakness in consumer discretionary,\" she said.\n\n\"You can look at one of the big ones like Wesfarmers, for example, and go, 'What's happening at the lower end?' the less expensive retailers like Kmart, and so on.\n\nGemma Dale has warned that the hot money might be cooling. (Supplied)\n\n\"Are we starting to see a shift into less expensive items, that sort of thing.\n\n\"So I think there'll be a fair bit of interest in that.\"\n\nMr Montgomery is more pessimistic about Australia's retail sector.\n\n\"And that's because that cost-of-living crisis hasn't gone away,\" he said.\n\n\"And the rate increase has really just heaped burning coals on the heads of that cost-of-living crisis for those people who are suffering.\"\n\nWhile interest rate hikes pinch shoppers' hip pocket nerves, they are expected to deliver Australia's biggest bank, the CBA, an earnings upgrade for the second half of the year.\n\n\"We know that in terms of net interest margins, higher interest rates are favourable for the Australian banks,\" Ms Dale said.\n\n\"So it has meant that the Australian banks' earnings upgrade cycle has been able to play out commensurate with the mining upgrade cycle.\"\n\nThe healthcare sector is the wild card this earnings reporting season, according to analysts. (Unsplash: TabTrader.com)\n\nMarket darling CSL may falter\n\nThe wild card this earnings reporting season, analysts say, is the healthcare sector, especially CSL.\n\n\"Investors do love that stock if they've held it for a long time, but it's so weak and they're looking for some turnaround,\" Ms Dale said.\n\n\"Earnings growth is still there, but it needs to be strong.\n\n\"They need to see the sales growth; they need to see management nail the story about how they're getting back on track.\n\n\"That's what [investors] really want to see.\"\n\nDonald Trump, US trade policy and geopolitics will influence the bottom lines of Australia's major corporations, analysts say. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nWorld events make it hard for Australian companies\n\nAll analysts the ABC spoke to about the upcoming reporting season said Donald Trump, US trade policy and geopolitics would influence the bottom lines of Australia's major corporations.\n\n\"Well, it makes it very hard for companies to budget,\" Mr Montgomery said.\n\n\"It makes it very difficult for them to forecast.\n\n\"So we might see CEOs and CFOs reluctant to provide guidance.\n\n\"And the other thing we know is that Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, while it might be great for economic growth and that's a positive for companies that are earning money in the United States or expanding to the United States, it also keeps inflation sticky and that could put a lid on valuations.\"",

(ABC Tropical North: Bryn Wakefield)\n\n\"That's been a bit of a reality, to wake up and realise that you've got nothing, you've got no home, no clothes, no belongings.\"\n\nTropical Cyclone Koji made landfall between Ayr and Bowen on January 11, bringing heavy rain and wind to the Whitsundays and nearby towns.\n\nThe wild weather destroyed 25 boats, and according to Maritime Safety Queensland (MSQ) up to half were part-time or permanent liveaboard homes.\n\nMore than a boat\n\nEmbellish had been Mr Stafford's home for five years since leaving his home town of Melbourne after losing his best friend to suicide.\n\nHe sailed up the east coast, having little contact with the outside world.\n\nThe Monaco Princess was moved to a storage space in an Airlie Beach boat yard after it was damaged during Tropical Cyclone Koji.

(ABC News: Jasmine Hines)\n\n\"That wind just built and built and built \u2026 the seas were in 4 metres,\" he said.\n\nObserving from a nearby hotel room, Mr Stafford watched as Embellish initially survived the storm.\n\nBut that short-lived relief turned to horror when before his eyes, a larger vessel came loose, knocking her off the mooring.\n\nAs the waves sent Embellish careering into a rock wall, a devastated Mr Stafford said he could not watch.\n\nSome recovery funding available\n\nFor nearly four weeks, Mr Stafford has been assessing his options while living in hotel rooms and tinkering on an old, smaller boat donated to him.\n\nHe estimated his loss to be about $200,000.\n\nLiving on a boat offered a cheap, healthy lifestyle for Mr Stafford. (ABC Tropical North: Bryn Wakefield)\n\nHe had not purchased cyclone insurance cover as it was \"hard to come by\" and cost up to $8,000 per year.\n\nAccording to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority (QRA), liveaboard boat owners in the Whitsundays have been eligible for disaster recovery funding since January 22.\n\nMeans-tested packages of up to $80,000 for destroyed homes, including boats, are available for those without insurance if it was the owner's sole residence.\n\nOther QRA grants covering lost household items also included boaties.\n\nSome boats remain half-sunk in the water. (ABC Tropical North: Bryn Wakefield)\n\nMr Stafford said while he had been in contact with the local council and state government, he had not yet received information on financial support.\n\nThe Whitsunday Regional Council told the ABC there had been a \"silent activation\" of the QRA funding and it was working with residents to assess damages.\n\nIn a statement, the Queensland Department of Housing said it was unable to comment on individual matters but said it had assisted \"several people\" who lost boats with \"temporary motel accommodation, offers of housing and referrals to RentConnect\".\n\nPermanent solution 'years' away\n\nBoatie Luke Jewson is another who lost his home, Wide Load, in the storm when the 11-metre racing cruiser came off its mooring during the wild weather, hitting a rock wall.\n\n\"I lost everything, everything I own,\" he said.\n\nLuke Jewson's owned his boat, Wide Load, for just three months before it was destroyed during Tropical Cyclone Koji. (Supplied: Luke Jewson)\n\n\"There's still bits and pieces there that obviously I can't pay for to be removed, so we'll wait and see how that turns out.\"\n\nHe plans to sleep in a swag at a mate's house near Airlie Beach while waiting for his recovery funding to be approved.\n\nMr Jewson said the Department of Housing deemed his case a \"priority\" but long-term public housing was in short supply in the Whitsundays.\n\n\"It could be a few years [before I move in],\" he said.\n\nClean-up underway\n\nOver the last month, MSQ has removed and salvaged 25 vessels damaged by the cyclone.\n\nGeneral manager Kell Dillon said the full process may take another month.\n\n\"Some of [the boats] can be submerged just below the surface, a little bit hard to see, so if you are out on the water, navigate with extreme caution,\" he warned.\n\nVolunteers cleaned the remains of Embellish from a rock wall after the system passed. (Supplied: Eco Barge Clean Seas)\n\nEco Barge Clean Seas, a not-for-profit environmental organisation at Airlie Beach, said its volunteers removed more than 9 tonnes of rubbish from the beach after the cyclone.\n\nOrganiser Libby Edge said volunteers acted quickly to clean around the wreckages before debris was pushed out onto the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\"It was like \u2026 if we don't get this now, I know chasing that marine debris out on Whitsunday islands is so much harder,\" Ms Edge said.\n\n\"Our sea life, they're going to be entangled or impacted by this debris.\"",

    "text": "The ACT's mid-year budget papers have shown the deficit has been reduced by more than $600 million.\n\nIn 2025, the government revealed the forecast $971.7 million deficit had blown out to $1.1 billion.\n\nACT Treasurer Chris Steel said today's numbers showed the government was on track to reduce that to a deficit of $499.1 million in 2025-26, amounting to a $632 million turnaround.\n\nWhile it shows an improvement in the overall fiscal position, the figure is $72.6 million short of the government's previous projection.\n\nHealth funding deal with federal government\n\nIn a statement, Mr Steel said the ACT's economy was \"strong\" and had experienced \"29 years of continuous economic growth\".\n\n\"The Barr Labor government's strong financial management has ensured we can continue to support the delivery of high-quality services for the entire community and deliver on our progressive agenda to support community wellbeing,\" he said.\n\nMr Steel said they had struck a deal with federal Labor for \"a five-year health funding deal worth $4.1 billion to the ACT over the next five years\".\n\nHe described it as a \"fairer contribution\" from the Commonwealth government, which was only announced on Friday and was therefore not reflected in the budget papers being released today.\n\nMr Steel said that funding deal would improve the budget bottom line even further.\n\n\"The ACT will also receive additional funding to address the challenges that smaller jurisdictions face in delivering health services compared to larger jurisdictions while more permanent arrangements to address this issue are implemented,\" he said.\n\nIn announcing its budget last year, the government said it would be introducing a $250 health levy to try to address the deficit.\n\nAmid public outcry, the levy was then slashed to $100 for residential and rural property owners and remained at $250 for commercial properties.\n\nMr Steel said the health levy would remain in place for now.\n\n\"We said that we would consider that in the next budget process, awaiting the outcome of the national health reform agreement negotiations, which has gone on for two years now and finally been concluded,\" he said.\n\n\"But we'll be looking right across the budget to make sure we balance both financing the needs of our community, particularly in healthcare, which is our largest area of expenditure in the budget, whilst also making sure that we chart a path back to budget sustainability, which we are showing in the budget review today.\"\n\nMore teachers, learning assistants\n\nAmong the funding announcements in the budget update, is $43 million for education.\n\n\"We've also increased significantly the number of people who are working as learning assistants,\" Mr Steel said.\n\nHe pointed to the fact the government last year had exempted health and schools from their budget cuts.\n\nSavings made in 'restraining growth' of public service\n\nMr Steel said while the government had not met its forecast deficit, what had been reached was a variance of less than one per cent.\n\nThe turnaround had been reached due to a \"combination of difficult decisions\" made \"on the expenditure side of the budget in restraining the growth of the public service\", Mr Steel said.\n\n\"We've put in place new budget control measures and we've been working with agencies to very tightly manage cash particularly this financial year, which means that we don't need a supplementary appropriation bill to be passed by the Assembly to have a top up in funding,\" he said.\n\n\"This is going to be a multi-year effort.\"\n\nHe said the ACT public service had grown \"substantially\" over the last five years \"and so we did need to look at constraining that\".\n\n\"It will still grow in the future but the level of growth just won't be as high,\" he said.\n\nMr Steel said there was no hiring freeze in place.\n\n\"But we need to make sure we're looking at recruitment ... and that agencies are working within their budgets\", he said.\n\nMr Steel will deliver the mid-year budget to the Assembly later today.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nFor Billie Marten, music is as natural as breathing. At 26 the British singer-songwriter already boasts a decade-long career. It\u2019s a journey that began when her father taught her guitar at age seven and she has been writing songs ever since. Currently touring Australia and New Zealand \u2013 a run that kicked off in Brisbane on Wednesday \u2013 Marten is leaning into the intimate, \u201cnon-judgmental\u201d atmosphere she first discovered during a standout Sydney show last year. \u201cIt was the first show that I\u2019ve sat down at, actually,\u201d Marten recalls. \u201cAnd I just sat down and just started playing tunes and it was just so warm and so lovely and kind of non-judgmental. I found it to be a very accepting group of people.\u201d British singer-songwriter Billie Marten has kicked off her second Australian tour. Morse Code Marten\u2019s latest album, 2025\u2019s Dog Eared, captures this intimacy. A breezy blend of soft rock and folk, the record traverses an inner world of airy vocals and jazzy keys. The title, she explains, reflects her view of her work as an ongoing, unfinished project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure to make a \u2018definitive\u2019 record, and that is how people identify you,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it was the idea that you would dog-ear the page and come back to whatever is left. At the time it was: here\u2019s a small chapter of whatever just happened to me in the summer, and there will be more.\u201d The album flows from upbeat tracks like Feeling to slower, stripped-back numbers like Leap Year. The album also draws heavily on canine imagery as a tool for emotional sensitivity. In No Sudden Changes Marten invokes the image of a resting dog to describe a moment of peace: \u201cOutside its turning I am standing still/Like a dog whose chin is resting upon your windowsill\u201d. \u201cI had this strong connection to them and realised that they were the perfect subject to use as strong writing tools on an emotional sensitivity level.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer style is deeply rooted in the classics. Her namesake is the late British guitarist John Martyn. \u201cI grew up with John Martyn, who\u2019s a family favourite of ours, so much so that I took his name and changed a letter.\u201d Folk legends Joni Mitchell and Nick Drake, and American alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, are influences. \u201cThey appear incredibly independent, no matter what time they\u2019re in,\u201d Marten says. \u201cThey\u2019re just timeless people. So I kind of follow them to the ends of the Earth.\u201d Marten was signed by Chess Club Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music, at 15 years old, and her discography now spans five studio albums. The musician struggles with being labelled prolific. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honour that people think so. But you know, technically, if I\u2019d started when I was 25, that would have been a normal, I suppose, progression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarten was signed by a major label at 15. Morse Code \u201cI think because I got signed \u2013 this was around 2014, 2015, which seems miles away from where we are now in the industry \u2013 it was just beginning to tip from records and vinyl into streaming. So I think I was very kind of protective about wanting to make, you know, records that counted, and wanted to make music that was everlasting, rather than the time we\u2019re in now, which is that you have to make an immediate imprint. \u201cBut I\u2019d say, regardless of the \u2018prolificness\u2019\u201d \u2013 she signals the air quotes around the word \u2013 \u201cI certainly took my time and wanted to write things, you know, in real time.\u201d Now she is enjoying \u201cpissing off her bandmates\u201d trying to learn the piano and the fiddle, laughing as she describes playing \u201cplinky-plonky songs made for a five-year-old\u201d. Asked what\u2019s next, Marten pauses, thinks, then says: \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019ve worked in a two-year cycle for so long that I can anticipate what\u2019s coming to me next, and I feel that that is not the right headspace to be, in order to make something new. At the moment I\u2019m just trying to surprise my brain a little bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBillie Marten plays at Sydney\u2019s Metro Theatre on February 6 and Melbourne\u2019s Croxton Bandroom on February 7.

    "text": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has announced major job cuts, saying that \"painful\" restructuring was needed at the storied newspaper.\n\nThe newspaper \u2014 which gained legendary status when its reporting helped bring down former US president Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal \u2014 will see \"substantial\" reductions in its newsroom, executive editor Matt Murray said.\n\nAbout a third of The Washington Post's staff will be laid off, including more than 300 of the roughly 800 journalists in the newsroom, The New York Times reported. The Post did not disclose how many people it would lay off.\n\nThe shrinking of the Post comes as major traditional media outlets in the US face intense pressure from President Donald Trump, who routinely denigrates journalists as \"fake news\" and has launched multiple lawsuits over coverage of his presidency.\n\nBezos, one of the world's richest people, became close to Trump in the Republican's second term. His Amazon behemoth controversially paid Trump's wife, Melania Trump, a reported $40 million for a documentary this year, along with another $35 million for marketing.\n\nMurray said the shifts at the Post reflect the radically changing economy for news media.\n\nThis \"will help to secure our future...and provide us stability moving forward,\" Murray said in a note to employees.\n\nHe cited changes to the news ecosystem, from individuals who \"generate impact at low cost\" to AI-generated content, as well as financial challenges that have already produced rounds of cost-cutting and buyouts at the Post.\n\n\"The company's structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product,\" he said.\n\n\"And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often wrote from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\"\n\nOn Facebook, Marty Baron, the publication's executive editor until 2021, wrote: \"This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organizations.\"\n\nSports reporters, international correspondents let go\n\nMost of the paper's journalists overseas were let go, including its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.\n\nSports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back, and the paper's daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported.\n\nMurray said the Post would now focus on politics, national security, technology, investigations, and business, among other topics.\n\nBut a reporter who covered Amazon \u2014 currently valued at $3.7 trillion \u2014 was let go.\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable. A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future,\" the labour union representing many Post journalists said in a statement.\n\nIt called for supporters of the paper, acquired by Bezos in 2013, to rally outside its Washington D.C. headquarters at noon on Thursday.\n\nOne Post reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity to Reuters, called the newly announced layoffs a \"bloodbath\".\n\nThe White House's communications director, Stephen Cheung, reacted to the news with ridicule.\n\n\"Just a reminder that printing fake news is not a profitable business model,\" he posted on X.\n\nAudience loss over 2024 election campaign decision\n\nBaron said that Post owner Bezos had resisted \"brutal pressure\" from Trump in the past, but it was battered by \"ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top\".\n\nBezos blocked an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election \u2014 breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence, and a move seen as bending the knee to Trump.\n\nIn response, loyal readers \"fled the Post. In truth, they were driven away,\" Baron said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Harris, and the paper lost around US$100 million ($142.7 million) in 2024 as advertising and subscription revenues fell.\n\nIn May 2024, Post publisher Will Lewis told staffers the paper lost US$77 million ($110 million) over the preceding year and lost half of its audience since 2020.\n\nIn stark contrast, The New York Times announced Wednesday that it gained more than one million digital subscribers in 2025, bringing its total to nearly 13 million and confirming its dominant position in the US media market.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\"The only way to describe it is just - it's a dry heat. It's not really humid. It's a dry heat. You stand out in it, it's just hot.\"\n\nMeet Emily Dalton.\n\nShe runs a pub with her family at Ouyen, a small town roughly an hour south of Mildura, in far north-western Victoria.\n\nOuyen falls under the purview of the Mildura Rural City Council, a local government area comprising almost ten per cent of the state and which lately, according to Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Weibusch, has been one of the hottest around.\n\n\"We're obviously expecting extremely hot conditions right across the state, both in the north and the south today, with Melbourne expecting a forecast temp of 45 degrees, and in the northwest of the state, 49 degrees at both Ouyen and Mildura.\"\n\nThat was the day after Australia Day, and for Mildura it became the hottest day on record.\n\nThe nearby towns of Walpeup and Hopetoun also broke records, posting Victoria's all-time hottest temperatures.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of the story.\n\nMildura then had a heatwave, hitting temperatures above 40 degrees for the rest of the week, which Mildura Mayor Ali Cupper says is on another level.\n\n\u201cThe official temperature recorded - as in the high point - temperature recorded was 48.9. And temperature is of course recorded in the shade. So people's cars were showing 50 degrees. And that's hot - even for us.\"\n\nIn Ouyen, Emily Dalton says the locals coped the best they could.\n\n\"There's a few people at the pub. I think a lot of people are at home under their air cons though, and there's a fair few people down at the lake.\"\n\nThat's also how residents in Mildura itself approached the heat, many bunkering down in air-conditioned homes during the warmest part of the day.\n\nThe Council says it did its part by providing designated cooling spaces, extending opening hours in some publicly run facilities, and highlighting its heat awareness campaigns.\n\nMayor Ali Cupper says that they have long made a point of including messaging on heat stress to reach the estimated 79 diverse nationalities that live in Mildura.\n\n\"When it gets really hot the river can be a magnet almost to go and get some respite from the heat. But unless you've lived here for a while, the river can be quite deceptive. It looks a lot safer than it is... We've had very tragically over time some drownings of people who are new arrivals and who are recent immigrants or refugees. And so we've really made a point of providing that education.\"\n\nShe says for many locals, hot temperatures like this - and these kinds of adjustments - are par for the course.\n\n\"Well, what's the alternative?... I mean yeah, that's right. Yeah, we adapt. And of course... there's been human inhabitants of this region for many tens of thousands of years. And then even since colonisation, for generations there was no air conditioning. And it's always been hot.\"\n\nBut experts are in broad agreement that these heatwaves are intensifying, with multiple reports and studies blaming a worsening climate change situation for the trend.\n\nThat includes a report from the Australian Climate Service in December 2025 that Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said offered an idea of what the future might look like, without urgent action to drastically lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"Cascading, it will get worse over time. Compounding, each impact of climate change will make another impact worse. And concurrent, communities will suffer the impacts of climate change in different ways at the same time - and we'll have a lot to manage.\"\n\nThat means essentially it's not the last heatwave Mildura or other regional communities can expect to see - and that there could be impacts to be felt far and wide.\n\nTo begin with, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Caroline McElnay says it's not just a matter of people simply being uncomfortable.\n\nShe says heatwaves can literally be a matter of life and death, with extreme heat responsible for more mortalities in Australia than bushfires, cyclones, and floods combined.\n\n\"We know that prolonged heat can affect anyone, and when high heat continues for a number of days it can affect your health and make some people seriously unwell. Those most at risk are those over the age of 65, those with underlying health conditions, pregnant women, babies and children.\"\n\nThere are other concerns too.\n\nMildura is at the heart of the Lower Murray River region, an ecosystem that supports a range of wildlife and livelihoods, and which Environment Minister Murray Watt has just listed as critically endangered.\n\n\"The listing provides important recognition that despite the efforts of governments and communities, the Lower Murray remains under great stress, and that we need to do more to restore it and protect it.\"\n\nA study published in January in the Urban Sustainability journal** analysed large-scale bank card transaction data and daily temperature records in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide.\n\nIt found extreme heat events are driving substantial time-of-day shifts in consumer spending behaviour - and there's evidence of a similar trend in Mildura.\n\nSome businesses posted on social media that they would be closing early in the heat, while other shops in the town centre put signs on their doors.\n\nThere was almost no-one on the streets after the morning peak.\n\nFor those businesses that did stay open, Matt, from the Boathouse cafe on the banks of the Murray River, says it was unusually quiet.\n\n\"Not good. This time of year we're usually thriving. Plenty of staff on and plenty of work and plenty of customers enjoying the view. But yeah, this heatwave... I don't blame anyone. With it over 40 degrees it's a bit too hot to go out.\"\n\nThose providing essential services have had no choice however but to keep going.\n\nPublic libraries are traditionally valued and important places of social connection, offering not just books but access to technology and community programs.\n\nThe libraries that operate across Mildura are no exception.\n\nThey stayed open as the temperature rose outside, though their rural outreach service had to be cancelled during the heatwave because of safety concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, the Clinical Practice Manager for the Mallee District Aboriginal Service in Mildura, Steven Bowden, told NITV they got through by changing their standard operating procedures.\n\n\"All the mums and bubs that are coming in to see our KMS team and our maternal child health nurses, (we) rang them and said you know, we'll change those appointments to the morning or we'll come and see them to save mum and bub coming out in the heat... Then with our chronic disease team, our ICT program, they're doing all the medication runs first thing in the morning.\"\n\nAgriculture is a big part of Mildura.\n\nAround $1.1 billion is generated in gross agricultural production revenue every year - the most for any Australian local government area.\n\nThe Grewal family, originally from the Punjab in India, run a farming operation near Mildura, producing around 10,000 tonnes of wheat a year at Golden Grain Mills to supply Indian grocery stores and restaurants across Australia.\n\nAman Grewal told SBS Punjabi that climate change is an ever-present concern for them.\n\n\"Water availability and climate issues affect farming. Overall, farming is a bit of a challenge, especially in Australia when there is a lot of drought.\"\n\nThe Mayor says part of their planning is thinking about how the local economy might be impacted if there are significant changes in the current climate.\n\n\"Certainly with wheat the heat doesn't matter because the harvest has already happened. In terms of grapes, heat is good - like dry heat is okay, I mean, especially if you're drying fruit. Humidity is a problem - if we've got sort of humid type heat - because that can create outbreaks of disease... And so we're in the eye of the storm in many ways. They talk about climate moving south, which means that if we increasingly kind of have the climate of Wilcannia - that western NSW desert - it's going to much harder to grow what we grow, and our economy is fundamentally based on primary production and horticulture.\"\n\nAli Cupper says it's not just about protecting the economy though.\n\nShe says the Council is well aware of the science on climate change, and accepts it.\n\nOfficials have been devoting extra energy to figuring out what kind of emissions the Council is responsible for, and working out ways to mitigate them at a local level.\n\nAnd in February 2020, Mildura Rural City Council declared a climate emergency - despite the scepticism the Mayor says others have expressed.\n\n\"You know, you talk to people who have been farming the land for a very long time and they will say it's different to what it was when they were kids. There can be a reluctance in some quarters to accept climate science and to accept the realities. You know, I've always said we need to be really need to be honest with ourselves about those realities and those risks.\"\n\nIn the meantime, life goes on.\n\nEmily Dalton's daughter Violet has returned to school, albeit reluctantly.\n\n\"Like, I'm excited to see my friends again, but I'm also like - I don't want to learn in this hot, sticky weather.\"\n\nAnd Kamaljit Grewal says the family intends to keep overcoming the challenges they face.\n\n\"We grew up doing farm work alongside our parents and cousins while studying. I feel proud to say that now our next generation - our children - are also following the same path. We are carrying forward the work of our ancestors.\"",

    "text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) this week lifted interest rates for the first time in two years, and one key factor was behind the decision: inflation.\n\nIn an attempt to slow spending and curb inflation, the central bank's monetary policy board voted unanimously voted to lift the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.85 per cent.\n\nFor borrowers, the news is an unfortunate sign that some belt-tightening time may be on the horizon.\n\nAcknowledging this, RBA governor Michelle Bullock said: \"I know this is not the news that Australians with mortgages want to hear, but it is the right thing for the economy.\"\n\nSo \u2014 what's the cash rate, what's inflation, what drives an increase, and what can be done about it?\n\nWhat is inflation?\n\nThe inflation rate is the rate at which the price of consumer goods is increasing.\n\nIt's tracked using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The CPI is reported monthly, with an additional quarterly release.\n\nThe RBA aims to keep inflation within its target band of 2-3 per cent. Over recent months it has been creeping higher, with headline CPI inflation rising to 3.8 per cent in the year to December 2025, up from 3.4 per cent in the year to November. Measures of underlying inflation \u2014 which strip out volatile price swings like petrol \u2014 have also lifted, with trimmed mean inflation at 3.3 per cent, up from 3.2 per cent a month earlier.\n\nThe RBA's monetary policy board meets eight times a year to decide whether to raise, cut or hold the cash rate \u2014 using it to cool down spending when prices are rising too fast, or to support the economy when growth is weak.\n\nWith \"underlying momentum of inflation ... too strong\" as it convened for its first meeting of the year, the board voted unanimously to raise rates.\n\nLISTEN TO What is really driving inflation? & software shares smashed SBS News 19:09 English\n\nJack Thrower, senior economist at progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said interest rate hikes worked by curbing the spending of those with large debts.\n\n\"If interest rates go up, then people with lots of debt, usually mortgage holders, will have to pay more in interest, which means they have less money to spend on other things,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\"If they start spending less money, then businesses will see demand for their goods and services go down, and they won't be able to put up their prices because fewer people want to buy their stuff.\"\n\nHe said this way, businesses could even be incentivised to lower prices to attract more customers.\n\nWhat is the cash rate?\n\nThe cash rate is the key interest rate set by the RBA. It affects how much it costs banks to borrow money, and that flows through to the interest rates many of us pay \u2014 and earn \u2014 on things like home loans and savings accounts.\n\nWhen the cash rate goes up, repayments on loans can rise, especially for people on variable-rate mortgages. People with savings may get higher interest on their bank accounts.\n\nWhat's driving high inflation?\n\nOn Tuesday, the RBA gave several key reasons for higher inflation, including: growing private demand, capacity pressures greater than previously assessed, and a tight labour market.\n\nAMP chief economist Shane Oliver said a rise in private demand referred to spending by Australian consumers on homes, construction, and investment.\n\n\"Capacity pressures\" relate to the intersection of demand and supply in the economy. These can drive inflation when demand for resources is high, but output is constrained by fewer resources.\n\nSource: SBS News\n\n\"If more demand appeared in the economy, then the economy doesn't have the capacity to expand production because it's running out of those resources, whether they're capital, like offices and machinery equipment, or whether they're people,\" Thrower said.\n\n\"If the business can't expand more, bring in more resources and increase its output when it sees more people wanting its goods, what it'll do instead is it'll put up its prices. And so when we reach these capacity constraints, we find that businesses start putting up their prices to earn bigger profits.\n\n\"That's what the RBA is worried businesses will start doing.\"\n\nTo counteract capacity constraints, Thrower and Oliver both stressed the importance of productivity.\n\n\"Productivity is basically the way we combine all those resources to make stuff. If we work more efficiently, then we can produce more with what we have,\" Thrower said.\n\n\"We could also increase it by building more factories and making more tools and equipment, or we could expand our workforce. We could bring in more migrants, for example. And if we did that, then we would have more workers and therefore we could produce more stuff.\"\n\nOliver warned that while a tight labour market was good news for workers, it could lead to upward pressure on inflation.\n\n\"Because workers, understandably, demand higher wages when there is greater demand for their services,\" he said.\n\nOther 'one-off' pressures\n\nThrower said the RBA had acknowledged a handful of \"one-off\" and \"unusual\" events that weren't of serious concern, including expenditure on overseas holidays, and the withdrawal of federal and state electricity price subsidies across Australia.\n\nMeg Elkins, associate professor of economics at RMIT University, said the December inflation rate was \"unsurprising\".\n\n\"Food and accommodation, you've got travel in there, you've got cultural activities. And if you think about the last couple of months, we've had lots of artists coming out, and we're paying more for our tickets than ever,\" Elkins told SBS News.\n\nShe pointed to \"rational expectations\" to explain consumer behaviours throughout 2025, amid three rate cuts.\n\n\"We base our behaviour on what we expect to happen next. Because there was an idea that rates would continue to come down, we factored that in, loosened the purse strings and spent a little bit more.\n\n\"And the reverse of that is now that we're being told to tighten our belts, I think people will also factor that in and spend less. So businesses that might expect demand to rise will increase their prices, and we don't want that spiral happening.\"\n\nWhat can I do about it?\n\nNot much, according to Thrower.\n\n\"It's a macroeconomic problem. It concerns the entire economy. And so it's difficult for individuals to do very much about it at all.\"\n\nHe said in the end, inflation was about whether businesses could increase their prices.\n\n\"We assume in a market economy like Australia's that firms are going to try and maximise their profits, and to do that, they'll often try and get as high a price as they can for their goods.\"\n\nThrower said a lot of the inflation we were facing could be driven by a lack of market competition across the biggest consumer goods firms, like groceries, insurance and airlines.\n\n\"In Australia, there's not a lot of competition and a lot of industries are dominated by a few large firms. Because there's only a few firms, they don't face a lot of stiff competition, and so consequently they have a lot of market power, and they're simply able to increase their prices easily.\n\n\"And every time there's this sort of increase in demand, that's what they choose to do.\"\n\nElkins says there are a few things Australians can do. Foremost was shopping around and exercising your right to purchase with the right companies.\n\n\"If you are a borrower, the onus is to put money aside and spend less and be strategic, shop around, don't pay the highest prices. And I think that sends a signal back to businesses,\" she said.\n\n\"And that's what we can do. The rest is now up to businesses and government to raise productivity.\"\n\nBut she warned the interest rate hike doesn't affect everyone equally, describing the gulf between self-funded retirees and those who rent or have a mortgage as \"almost like a two-tier economy\".\n\n\"If businesses sense that there's an excess demand out there, they will increase their prices,\" she said.\n\nShe added that this week's rate hike is signalling to the market that \"consumers need to slow down\".\n\nIt's why Michelle Bullock called the rate hike a \"blunt instrument\" to curb inflation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Bullock ackowledged the impact on households.\n\n\"For mortgage holders, this isn't a great outcome,\" she said. \"But what's also not great for them, or for anyone else, is if inflation remains elevated.\n\n\"Ultimately, it is best if we get inflation under control, and our instrument is the interest rate.\"\n\nElkins says it's fairly obvious what the RBA expects average Australians to do: \"Spend less, save more, and stop asking for big wage increases.\"\n\n\"But they'll never phrase that last one in that way,\" she said.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

He has won several medals in halfpipe events, making him a strong contender.\n\nSnowboard cross star and three-time Olympian Adam Lambert \u2014 from Jindabyne in the Snowy Mountains region of NSW \u2014 comes into these games as world number one following a win at the Snowboard World Cup round in China last month.\n\nOlympic medallists Jakara Anthony, Scotty James, Jarryd Hughes, Matthew Graham and Tess Coady will be aiming for more glory.\n\nAnthony, a freestyle skier from Cairns, is the only gold medallist in the team, taking out the top spot in Beijing in 2022. The 27-year-old comes into Milan and Cortina as world number one and will be aiming for back-to-back gold.\n\nFellow freestyle skier Graham holds a silver medal from the PyeongChang Games in 2018, and Milan will likely be his last chance at winning gold.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers responding to questions on potential changes to concessions around the Capital Gains Tax:\n\n\"Well, the news about the capital gains tax comes from a committee that the greens and the Liberals set up in the Senate. We've made it very clear that we consider there to be inter-generational issues in housing, but our focus there is on building more homes, on supply, and our focus on tax is about cutting income taxes and introducing a standard deduction and legislating better targeted super concessions and lifting the low income super tax offset, and doing the work that we've commissioned on multinational taxes. And so we haven't changed our policy on capital gains, that committee work is ongoing.\"\n\nThis follows the 0.25 per cent interest rate hike announced yesterday by the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nThe government is facing a renewed wave of pressure to reform the tax, with Australian Council of Trade Union's President Michele O\u2019Neil leading a growing chorus of voices who argue that capital gains concessions must be addressed to provide cost-of-living relief for Australian workers.\n\n\"Too many workers can no longer afford to live near where they work, and a growing number of workers will never be able to save enough for a deposit. At the same time, accelerating rents and house prices are outpacing the money people can save each week. The way the capital gains tax operates has become a tax avoidance scheme, with most of the benefit going to the richest 1% of Australians. To make things worse, the discount is effectively paid for by working people who pay much higher rates of tax in line with their personal income. Our tax system shouldn't reward wealth more than work.\"\n\nSo what is the capital gains tax discount and and why is it back in the public conversation?\n\nWith 2.2 million Australians owning at least one investment property, senior economist Matt Grundoff from the Australia institute explains how it works.\n\n\"The capital gains tax discount is a fifty percent discount, or half of any capital gain is only taxed. that means, if you earn, say, three hundred thousand dollars by selling a house for more than you bought it, only half of that capital gain, $150,000, would be subject to tax, the other half would be tax free.\"\n\nIt isn't a separate tax you pay the moment you sell something; rather, the profit is usually added to your total income for the year and taxed at your standard income tax rate.\n\nDr Tim Thornton from the school of Political Economy says that capital gains tax reform is essential.\n\nHe says that if interest rate hikes are forcing a closer look at government budgets, then any resulting spending cuts must be distributed more equitably.\n\n\"An obvious way to do this would be to restrict tax concessions on capital gains and negative gearing. This would reduce the income of investors rather than mortgage holders. Such tax concessions should really only be permitted in instances where investors are constructing new housing stock rather than just bidding up the price of old bricks and mortar. Now, if that idea sounds a bit too pie in the sky for anybody, it's worth recalling that this idea was ALP policy up until July 2021, and was really only abandoned because they lost their nerve, rather than because they thought it was in any way bad policy.\"\n\nHowever, leading Australian Economist Chris Richardson says the mismatch between high demand and low supply is always the primary driver of inflation.\n\nHe suggests that while reforming capital gains concessions is a noble pursuit, the core of the housing and inflation crisis remains a fundamental shortage of housing supply.\n\nAccording to his modelling, changing concessions to the CGT would only reduce housing prices by between 1 and 4 per cent.\n\n\"Economists around the world are talking about abundance that you know, we need to get better at producing stuff, and housing in Australia is a beautiful example of that. For some decades now, housing policies in Australia could be summarised as the word no, no, you can't do that. No, you can't build here. No, you can't build like that, and even where it is, a Yes, all right, you can build it. But it's with all these rules and restrictions that means what gets built is a stunningly expensive thing, and that, of course, gets you gets passed on to people.\"\n\nEconomist Chris Richardson says orthodox, or neoclassic, economic theory argues that capital gains concessions are necessary to prevent investors from being taxed on phantom gains.\n\nThey are gains caused purely by inflation over several decades.\n\nHowever, he says there's a foundational assumption in economics: the idea that the rich save and the poor spend.\n\nUsing this logic, the wealthy serve as the primary engine for national savings.\n\n\"Governments should be Robin Hood. They should tax the rich to spend on the poor, but the rich save and the poor don't save. You know, in relative terms, it's easier for the rich to save, it's hard for the poor to save. And so when governments do what they should do, tax the rich, spend on the poor, you lower the amount of saving in in the economy, and that means we don't set enough aside for the future.\"\n\nHowever Dr Tim Thornton says given the numbers surrounding the latest rate increase, this argument is not convincing.\n\n\"Some have argued changing the capital gains tax would not be effective in reducing overall spending because the wealthy, who are the main beneficiaries of the currently unreformed capital gains tax and negative gears don't spend a very high proportion of their income anyway. I don't find this argument persuasive for several reasons, most obviously because these tax concessions result in $20 billion a year in foregone government revenue. So by removing these concessions, the government could remove up to $20 billion of spending from the economy. Now this is no small thing, particularly if one recalls Chris Richardson's estimate that a $7 billion change in government spending is equivalent to a 25 basis point interest rate movement.\"\n\nEconomist Matt Grundoff says the capital gains tax concessions encourage speculators into the market which pushes up the price of housing, making it harder for first home buyers to get into the market.\n\nHe says the only time in which the capital gains tax concessions should be used is to invest in new builds.\n\n\"To be clear, at the moment, more than 80% of all houses that are sold as investment properties are second hand houses, houses that already exist, so only a minority are new houses. But if those new houses are encouraging new buildings to be built, then perhaps we could restrict the capital gains tax discount to just new builds.\"",

Got it Share A A A\n\nFor Billie Marten, music is as natural as breathing. At 26 the British singer-songwriter already boasts a decade-long career. It\u2019s a journey that began when her father taught her guitar at age seven and she has been writing songs ever since. Currently touring Australia and New Zealand \u2013 a run that kicked off in Brisbane on Wednesday \u2013 Marten is leaning into the intimate, \u201cnon-judgmental\u201d atmosphere she first discovered during a standout Sydney show last year. \u201cIt was the first show that I\u2019ve sat down at, actually,\u201d Marten recalls. \u201cAnd I just sat down and just started playing tunes and it was just so warm and so lovely and kind of non-judgmental. I found it to be a very accepting group of people.\u201d British singer-songwriter Billie Marten has kicked off her second Australian tour. Morse Code Marten\u2019s latest album, 2025\u2019s Dog Eared, captures this intimacy. A breezy blend of soft rock and folk, the record traverses an inner world of airy vocals and jazzy keys. The title, she explains, reflects her view of her work as an ongoing, unfinished project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure to make a \u2018definitive\u2019 record, and that is how people identify you,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it was the idea that you would dog-ear the page and come back to whatever is left. At the time it was: here\u2019s a small chapter of whatever just happened to me in the summer, and there will be more.\u201d The album flows from upbeat tracks like Feeling to slower, stripped-back numbers like Leap Year. The album also draws heavily on canine imagery as a tool for emotional sensitivity. In No Sudden Changes Marten invokes the image of a resting dog to describe a moment of peace: \u201cOutside its turning I am standing still/Like a dog whose chin is resting upon your windowsill\u201d. \u201cI had this strong connection to them and realised that they were the perfect subject to use as strong writing tools on an emotional sensitivity level.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer style is deeply rooted in the classics. Her namesake is the late British guitarist John Martyn. \u201cI grew up with John Martyn, who\u2019s a family favourite of ours, so much so that I took his name and changed a letter.\u201d Folk legends Joni Mitchell and Nick Drake, and American alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, are influences. \u201cThey appear incredibly independent, no matter what time they\u2019re in,\u201d Marten says. \u201cThey\u2019re just timeless people. So I kind of follow them to the ends of the Earth.\u201d Marten was signed by Chess Club Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music, at 15 years old, and her discography now spans five studio albums. The musician struggles with being labelled prolific. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honour that people think so. But you know, technically, if I\u2019d started when I was 25, that would have been a normal, I suppose, progression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarten was signed by a major label at 15. Morse Code \u201cI think because I got signed \u2013 this was around 2014, 2015, which seems miles away from where we are now in the industry \u2013 it was just beginning to tip from records and vinyl into streaming. So I think I was very kind of protective about wanting to make, you know, records that counted, and wanted to make music that was everlasting, rather than the time we\u2019re in now, which is that you have to make an immediate imprint. \u201cBut I\u2019d say, regardless of the \u2018prolificness\u2019\u201d \u2013 she signals the air quotes around the word \u2013 \u201cI certainly took my time and wanted to write things, you know, in real time.\u201d Now she is enjoying \u201cpissing off her bandmates\u201d trying to learn the piano and the fiddle, laughing as she describes playing \u201cplinky-plonky songs made for a five-year-old\u201d. Asked what\u2019s next, Marten pauses, thinks, then says: \u201cThe thing is, I\u2019ve worked in a two-year cycle for so long that I can anticipate what\u2019s coming to me next, and I feel that that is not the right headspace to be, in order to make something new. At the moment I\u2019m just trying to surprise my brain a little bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBillie Marten plays at Sydney\u2019s Metro Theatre on February 6 and Melbourne\u2019s Croxton Bandroom on February 7.

Advanced Micro Devices dropped 17.3 per cent even though the chip company reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecast for revenue for the start of 2026 that topped analysts\u2019 expectations, but that may not have been enough for investors after its stock had doubled over the last 12 months. Tech stocks are broadly feeling pressure, even when they deliver stronger-than-expected profits. Big Tech stocks are facing criticism that their prices shot too high following their years-long dominance of the market.
