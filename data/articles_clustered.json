    "text": "A new report from the Productivity Commission has knocked down the theory that working from home is behind the nationally drooping production levels.\n\nThe new report looked at the \"productivity bubble\" in which labour productivity rose \ufeffduring the COVID-19 pandemic between January 2020 and March 2022, and the reasons for its subsequent decline.\n\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic was a rollercoaster for productivity, but we are now back to the stagnant status quo,\" commission deputy chair Dr Alex Robson said.\n\nThe COVID-19 lockdowns have led to a lasting change in Australia's workforce. (Getty)\n\nThe report found productivity grew in that time bec\ufeffause those industries hardest hit, such as accommodation and food services, were those with the lowest labour productivity.\n\nThis meant the workforce by default shifted to have an emphasis on more productive sectors.\ufeff\n\nProductivity experienced more genuine growth from December 2020 to March 2022\ufeff, as worker output improved and the labour market began to recover.\n\nWorking from home is not deemed threatening to productivity, a new report has found. (Getty)\n\nBut it's the phase after that - the \"productivity loss\" phase between June 2022 and June 2023 - which the report was built around.\n\nIt found that the investment in equipment, tools and resources needed to get the most out of work didn't keep pace with the increase in hours worked post-lockdowns.\n\nPeople were working longer hours, but with less support to help their productivity.\n\nAlso, many younger and less experienced people joined the workforce after years in and out of lockdown and shrinking employment.\n\nREAD MORE: The top ten richest people in Australia\n\nBut working from home was not among the report's culprits for lost productivity.\n\nWhile it found research suggested fully remote working with no in-person interaction could make people less productive, the report also found hybrid models helped boost job satisfaction, worker retention, and potentially productivity.\n\nWorking from home \"all or most days\" of the week has also tripled around the country from the start of the pandemic (12 per cent) to August 2024 (36 per cent).\n\nThe report did note that less experienced and younger workers may benefit from more in-person work.\n\nThe five qualifications in hot demand for Australia's future jobs View Gallery\n\n\"However, given most studies find hybrid work to be either neutral or positive for labour productivity, there is no evidence to suggests that the trend towards hybrid working has contributed to the productivity loss phase of the productivity bubble,\" the report said.\n\nRobson said the \"big lesson\" of the burst productivity bubble was that there were \"no shortcuts\" to growing productivity.\n\n'Tackling our productivity problem will require dedicated effort and reform from business and government,\" he said.\n\nThe commission will pass the results of five inquiries into the issue to the government this year.",

(Getty Images: Dom Emmert/AFP)\n\nSworn in as PM in 2017 aged 37, Jacinda Ardern became a phenomenon as Jacindamania swept New Zealand then the world, partly in response to her youth but also the highly unusual circumstances of her giving birth while in office (Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto was the only other modern politician to do so, in 1990).\n\nMs Ardern's political achievements were only possible after overcoming deep personal uncertainty about her abilities.\n\n\"My whole short life,\" she writes in her memoir, \"I'd grappled with the idea that I was never quite good enough, that at any moment I would be caught short.\"\n\nJacinda Ardern on the political campaign trail. (Supplied: Jacinda Ardern)\n\n\"There are plenty of people who have this experience,\" Ms Ardern told 7.30. \"There just happens to be very few who then share it or talk about it out loud.\n\n\"I think one of the reasons that we don't discuss, for instance, imposter syndrome, we don't discuss confidence gap, is because people have something to lose in doing so. I don't.\n\n\"You know, I've had a significant career in politics. I made the decision to leave. There was something very freeing in there and now I feel absolutely able to have this kind of open conversation.\n\nJacindamania swept New Zealand when she became prime minister in 2017. (Twitter: Jacinda Ardern)\n\n\"Over time I've seen the strength that comes from what we perceive to be weakness. A confidence gap often leads to humility, a willingness to bring in experts and advisors, and I think ultimately makes you a better decision maker.\"\n\nHaving worked in a junior position for former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clarke, Ms Ardern initially regarded herself as too sensitive, too thin-skinned to survive in politics.\n\n\"Most people would look at politics and say, 'Have I got the armour required to be in that space?' And it was actually when I was in parliament itself that I really made the decision that I wasn't willing to change who I was in order to survive what we might call the bear pit.\"\n\nJacinda Ardern speaks to representatives of the Muslim community after the Christchurch mosque attacks in March 2019. (AP: New Zealand Prime Minister Office)\n\nMs Ardern said the purpose of writing the book, rather than producing a typical politician's memoir, was to encourage more people to consider entering public life.\n\n\"I was convinced that if I was going to write anything, it should really be a story about how it feels to lead because you know, who knows who's out there, considering whether or not they have what it takes, considering whether or not they can succeed if they lead with empathy,\" she said.\n\nThe prime minister and the porcelain\n\nJacinda Ardern and her partner Clarke Gayford with their baby daughter Neve in June, 2018. (AAP: David Rowland)\n\nHow it feels to lead included experiencing acute morning sickness just as Ms Ardern was about to be sworn in as prime minister.\n\n\"I was slumped on the floor thinking, 'what if during this very formal ceremony I can't hold it in?' It's not the kind of thought process you want to go through when you're about to have the speech from the throne, from the then Queen's representative, all the heads of judiciary, the defence force and every single member of parliament sitting in one space facing you.\"\n\nFortunately for Ms Ardern she got through it.\n\n\"No one was the wiser. Except my porcelain toilet,\" the former prime minister said.\n\nMs Ardern told 7.30 the reasons why she did not initially make the news of her pregnancy public.\n\nJacinda Ardern with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, 2018. (Reuters: Charles Platiau/Pool)\n\n\"I was in negotiation to become prime minister. That's a particularly delicate time,\" she said.\n\n\"Equally ... I knew having just been elected, my priority somehow may have appeared to be misplaced. And I didn't believe that to be true but I felt I needed to demonstrate that was the case before revealing the happy news that I was also going to have a baby.\"\n\nIn her meteoric rise to the top of New Zealand politics, Ms Ardern was subjected to plenty of critiques aimed at her gender.\n\nWhile in opposition she was often depicted as a show pony in cartoons and analysis. One female MP described Ms Ardern's appointment as Labor leader a \"cosmetic facelift\".\n\nJacinda Ardern and Clarke Gayford at Buckingham Palace in 2018. (Getty Images: Daniel Leal-Olivas/WPA Pool)\n\nShe pushed back hard on morning radio when a host suggested that as a young woman she was obliged to reveal her reproductive plans.\n\n\"That is not acceptable!\" she thundered at the presenter, repeating the line three times.\n\n\"It was the idea that any woman should be required to answer that question, and that was certainly what was implied there. I felt very strongly that that was not OK,\" Ms Ardern said.\n\nAlong with her descriptions of juggling the demands of national leadership and a baby, the need for nappy bags and breast pumps at international events, Ms Ardern also reveals the importance of the position she held did not make her immune from parental guilt.\n\nJacinda Ardern says Queen Elizabeth gave her advice about raising children as a public figure. (Reuters: Dominic Lipinski/Pool)\n\n\"Some might think that that's an example of where maybe your guilt should be a little bit lessened because you've got a pretty reasonable excuse to be busy and to not always be there, but my learning was actually it never goes away,\" she said.\n\nThe best advice she received was from Buckingham Palace.\n\nA pregnant Ms Ardern asked Queen Elizabeth II how she had raised her children as a public figure. The Queen's response was simple: \"You just get on with it.\"\n\nAnd, so, Ms Ardern did.\n\n\"It turned out, you know, the Queen was absolutely right with that advice,\" she said.\n\nLeaving politics\n\nJacinda Ardern announces her resignation as prime minister in January 2023. (AP: Warren Buckland/New Zealand Herald)\n\nAfter serving two terms as prime minister, steering New Zealand through the immense demands of COVID, in the economic downturn that followed Ms Ardern's popularity dropped sharply.\n\nIn January 2023, after nearly six years in office, she made the decision she was spent and wanted to step down.\n\nNow on a fellowship at Harvard University in the US, she is focused on the potential for empathetic leadership in politics.\n\nThe memoir, she says, is part of that.\n\n\"To share a little bit more about what it looks like behind the scenes in the hope that a few more people who might identify as criers, huggers and worriers might take up the mantle of leadership, because I'd say we need them,\" she said.\n\nWatch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV",

    "text": "A \"carbon tariff\" on dirty cement or steel made elsewhere could be considered in the Albanese government's second term, as Energy Minister Chris Bowen concedes Australia must \"do more\" to achieve its climate targets.\n\nMr Bowen said Australia was \"by and large on track\" to meet its legislated target of reducing emissions by 43 per cent by 2030, despite new figures this week showing flatlining progress in 2024.\n\n\"We've never suggested it's a linear line \u2026 But with the right approach from government, yes, we can continue to be on track [despite] facing headwinds and challenges from time to time,\" he told the ABC's Insiders.\n\nLabor approved a 40-year expanded licence to Australia's largest oil and gas project, Western Australia's North West Shelf, in a move criticised by environmental groups.\n\nMr Bowen said the decision by Environment Minister Murray Watt was made according to the \"very strict criteria of the environmental approvals legislation\", which does not allow consideration of emissions impacts and which Labor has so far failed to reform.\n\nWoodside gas project approved to 2070 Photo shows Close up of a collection of jagged red rocks. In the background, two towers spitting flames. The life of Australia's largest oil and gas project will be extended to 2070, with Environment Minister Murray Watt giving the long-awaited environmental approval for Woodside's North West Shelf project.\n\nBut he insisted the move would not jeopardise Australia's emissions efforts because the North West Shelf would be governed by Labor's safeguard mechanism, which forces large emitters to reach net zero emissions, including by purchasing offsets if they cannot avoid emissions \"onsite\".\n\n\"It's already obliged to be reducing emissions today and it is,\" he said.\n\n\"The whole idea of the safeguard mechanism is to send the message to the boards to say, 'Hey, you know, you should start investing in onsite emissions abatement here, because we're going to require you to buy offsets if you don't.'\"\n\nThe government will this year be required to set a 2035 emissions target, which it will consider pending advice from the independent Climate Change Authority.\n\nMr Bowen said he was willing to consider new policies if required, including the use of tariffs to ensure that companies do not shift emitting activities offshore to evade the intent of Australia's targets.\n\nThat practice, known as carbon \"leakage\", is already subject to a government review led by ANU Professor Frank Jotzo, whose preliminary papers identified clinker, cement and lime as particularly high leakage risks, and ammonia, steel and glass as moderate risk.\n\nMr Bowen said he would be guided by the Jotzo review, which was contemplating a \"carbon border adjustment mechanism\" that would impose an extra cost on imports made in countries without carbon prices.\n\nLiberal dysfunction allows Labor to get away scot-free on emissions Photo shows Murray Watt walking in front of a building. The government continues to whistle past the graveyard on national emissions.\n\n\"We have been clear that we want to ensure Australian industry is best placed to compete in a decarbonising world,\" he said.\n\n\"What could be the case is \u2026 we look at particular sectors first around cement and lime, [which] are places that we looked at in particular, but I'm not going to get in front of the process \u2026 We'll have more to say during the course of this term.\"\n\nThe US this week increased its global tariffs on steel, drawing fresh criticism from the Australian government.\n\nMr Bowen said he did not believe the Trump administration's abandonment of climate goals would derail Australian or global action.\n\n\"The United States is around 12 per cent of emissions globally. That's a lot, but it doesn't mean that the rest of the 88 per cent of us stop doing things.\"\n\nHe reiterated Australia's enthusiasm to host the next global climate conference in Adelaide.\n\n\"A conference that knocks it out of the park is our intention for Australia to showcase ourselves, to highlight the jobs opportunity for a traditional fossil fuel country like ours, that we can and will embrace the transition.\"",

(ABC News: Gavin McGrath)\n\nFederation University associate professor of history David Waldron said Jubilee had succumbed to the boom-bust cycle typical of many mining communities.\n\n\"What tends to happen is the economy that drove the town disappeared, the reason for the town to be there disappears and people gradually move on,\" Dr Waldron said.\n\n\"That becomes self-perpetuating as people leave. The shops have fewer people to sell to. There's less reason to be there, facilities disappear, and eventually so does the town for all intents and purposes.\"\n\nDavid Waldron says once the economic driver behind a town ceases to exist, people eventually move on. (ABC Central Victoria: Beth Gibson)\n\nAs is the way, Jubilee had a relatively short life.\n\nGold was found in the 1850s and, after a gold-bearing reef was uncovered in 1887, it become a boom town.\n\nHowever, the gold soon dried up and by 1912 Jubilee was completely abandoned.\n\nThe remains of Jubilee's cyanide plant are one of the few reminders of the once bustling mining town.

(ABC News: Allison Jess)\n\nIt's not the only ghost town on Australian maps.\n\nCook, in far western South Australia, was a railway town that serviced the Trans-Australian Railway and once boasted a hospital and school.\n\nBut the introduction of more reliable trains and railway lines meant Cook's role was eventually rendered redundant.\n\nIts population dwindled to next to nothing and it is now little more than a stopover point for passengers on the Indian Pacific train.\n\nCook in South Australia was once a thriving railway town. Now it is a stopover for tourists. (Wikimedia Commons: Mike Young, CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\nIt's now widely regarded as a ghost town, despite an official population of 71, according to the 2021 census.\n\nDr Waldron said any town that once boasted a large population but had declined to the point where practically all businesses and services had been wound up could be classified as ghost towns.\n\nThe remains of the Royal Hotel, which used to be the heart of the gold-rush town of Linda. (ABC Radio Hobart: Catherine Zengerer)\n\n\"If you look at the famous ghost town of Linda in western Tasmania, there are still some people who live there, who are hanging on,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes they try and set up tourism, which is the case [in] \u2026 Linda, being quite a strange gothic spectacle of a place.\"\n\nDr Waldron said other locations like Steiglitz in Victoria had become heritage sites.\n\n\"It's no longer about the industry that once led to the town being significant,\" he said.\n\nThe remains of St Cecilia's Catholic Church in Big Bell, Western Australia.

(Facebook: Greg Davis, Explored Visions)\n\nNew ghost towns\n\nChanges in agriculture continues to impact rural townships to this day.\n\nDr Waldron said some farming towns risked following old mining and railway settlements into ghost-town status.\n\n\"Farming is now a high-tech agricultural industry. The number of people employed has declined and the kind of employment is declined,\" he said.\n\n\"Those regional centres that accommodated those labourers now face economic decline and, in those cases, face a slow death as that industry transforms.\"\n\nSilverton, near Broken Hill, has a permanent population but is regarded by some as a ghost town. (Facebook: Greg Davis, Explored Visions)\n\nDr Waldron said there was hope for some of these ghost towns, mainly though tourism.\n\n\"Ghost towns are gaining in popularity and a lot of people are coming out from Melbourne as well as internationally to explore them,\" he said.\n\n\"With the tourists, and of course the tourists' money, comes new industries, new development and new opportunities.\n\n\"That's certainly happened in old gold mining towns in central Victoria such as Maldon and Castlemaine, which have redeveloped as cultural tourism centres.\"",

(ABC News: Rachel Pupazzoni)\n\nGlobal gold rush\n\nAustralia is the third-highest producer of gold in the world, behind China and Russia, and ties with Russia as the top country for gold mine reserves.\n\nUniversity of Queensland Sustainable Minerals Institute director Rick Valenta said the last time gold prices were close to 2025's numbers was in the 1980s, at $3,400 per troy ounce.\n\n\"It's the highest it's ever been in history. That's probably a pretty good definition of a gold boom,\" he said.\n\nHe said global political uncertainty caused gold prices to skyrocket in the past five years, driving the increase in fossicking, and reopening of historical mines across the country.\n\nRick Valenta says gold prices are at the highest point in history. (Supplied: Rick Valenta)\n\n\"A really common thing to do is to go back and re-look at mines, particularly if the production happened 50 to 100 years ago,\" he said.\n\n\"Methods for extracting [minerals] weren't as good as they are now, so people left a lot of gold behind.\n\n\"In many cases you can go back and retreat the tailings and waste from those mines to extract [even more gold].\"\n\nCloncurry gold\n\nNorth West Queensland's historic mining history puts it at the top of the global resources stage, Professor Valenta said.\n\n\"[North West Queensland] is just one of the special places on the planet that has an enormous amount of mineral endowment, and there's always that potential to take advantage of price cycles on deposits, where that can be done in a relatively short time,\" he said.\n\nThe Cloncurry Gold Project incorporates multiple mines across more than 400 square kilometres.

(ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nIn 2019, mining company Tombola Gold sought to revive production at Mount Freda, setting up production for AuKing and Orion.\n\nAuKing managing director Paul Williams said the project, which covers more than 400 square kilometres, aimed to be producing gold within the next 12 months.\n\n\"With the gold price where it is and projecting to still be strong, that's probably opened up areas that historically were not available for the earlier mining companies, like Tombola,\" he said.\n\nThe companies signed a preliminary agreement late last year and are set to finalise it at the end of July.\n\n\"We're operating in a great gold price environment at the moment with access to a huge amount of data from the good work that previous groups have done,\" Mr Williams said.\n\nThe historic Mount Freda gold mine is set to be acquired under the new Cloncurry Gold Project. (Supplied: Paul Williams)\n\n\"The previous companies who owned the mines beforehand didn't have the gold price environment that we do now.\n\n\"But we're looking to get moving with drilling initially and then hopefully probably around the Mount Freda area to start mining.\"\n\nThe project is not the only one in the North West and Cloncurry regions vying to capitalise on the boom.\n\nQgold's Woolgar Gold odyssey, 130 kilometres north of Richmond, is awaiting statutory approvals.\n\nMayfield Mt Isa Copper-Gold Project is also mining in the mineral-rich Mary Kathleen region, alongside the recently opened Greater Duchess Copper Gold Project.\n\nA Mount Freda gold pour in 1988 at the height of production in the area.

    "text": "Novak Djokovic has reached the fourth round of the French Open for the 16th consecutive year with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory over qualifier Filip Misolic in a match marked by noise from Paris Saint-Germain fans cheering as they watched the Champions League final on their phones.\n\nThere were also frequent sounds of fireworks popping from PSG's stadium, which is just a few blocks from Court Philippe-Chatrier. The French club won its first championship in the top soccer competition for European clubs, beating Italy's Inter Milan 5-0 in Munich, Germany.\n\nDjokovic originally was hoping to avoid playing at the same time as the match so he could watch it on TV.\n\n\"It was interesting. The crowd was really following the game. And I could hear when they scored. It was way too many times that they were celebrating,\" Djokovic said about the spectators in the Chatrier stands.\n\n\"I was like, 'wow, this is a lot of goals from Paris! What's going on?' Now I heard it's 5-0. Quite a result, to be honest.\"\n\nDuring one lengthy tennis point in the third set, some shouts accompanied PSG's fourth goal, and afterward, the chair umpire asked spectators to keep it down, drawing boos and whistles in response.\n\n\"Night sessions are always different. They're always louder. The people are always more excited. Everything is always loud and different from a day session,\" said Djokovic, who has won all nine sets he has played so far in this year's tournament.\n\n\"I knew I was going to have to be scheduled once to play at night. And it's OK. It's fine. I mean, I would be watching football, for sure. \u2026 [PSG] won it for the first time, so I don't know how we're all going to go back to our hotels.\n\n\"It's going to be quite a journey. Quite an adventure. But I think we are in for a long celebration and probably not much sleep tonight. It's a fun night to be in Paris, I guess.\"\n\nDjokovic has never lost to anyone ranked as low as No.153 Misolic at a grand slam tournament, and this one was never really in doubt. There was just a slight delay for him to take control.\n\nIn the second game, with Misolic serving, Djokovic held seven break points \u2014 and failed to convert any.\n\nThat made it 1-all. But Djokovic kept accumulating break chances and, eventually, cashed in on his 10th, to lead 4-2. That was essentially that.\n\nAgainst a man 15 years his junior, who was appearing in only his second grand slam tournament, the 38-year-old Djokovic made only 14 unforced errors \u2014 compared to 33 winners \u2014 and saved the only break point he faced.\n\n\"Solid when I needed to be,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"There's always something to improve. Something to get better at. But overall, I have to be pleased with the level of tennis so far.\"\n\nHe improved his career record at the French Open to 99-16, equalling his number of match wins at the Australian Open.\n\nHe has won three of his 24 major championships in Paris. A year ago in a fourth-round victory, Djokovic tore his the meniscus in his right knee and needed to withdraw from the tournament before his next match.\n\nThis time, Djokovic will try to reach the quarterfinals by beating Cam Norrie on Monday.\n\nDjokovic is 5-0 against Norrie, including a win at the Geneva Open the week before the French Open en route to the Serb's 100th career trophy.\n\n\"He's a big fighter. He's a grinder,\" said Djokovic, who beat Norrie in the 2022 Wimbledon semifinals.\n\n\"Cameron is known for that on the tour.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "Paris Saint-Germain, Champions League winner.\n\nAt long last the club that was transformed by Qatari billions and bought and sold a succession of the world's greatest players in an extravagant bid to get to the top has its hands on the big one.\n\nEuropean club soccer's grandest prize has a new home after PSG thrashed Inter Milan 5-0 in the final in Munich.\n\nThe trophy that not even Lionel Messi, Neymar or Kylian Mbappe could deliver to the French club was finally claimed by Luis Enrique, the Spanish coach who has overseen PSG's shift from the era of galactico signings to one of genuine team-building.\n\nFitting then that D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9, the 19-year-old French forward emblematic of the club's new generation, was the chief inspiration on a balmy night. He became the third teenager to score in a Champions League final, following Patrick Kluivert and Carlos Alberto.\n\nD\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9 drops to his knees as PSG claims the Champions League. (Getty Images: Michael Regan)\n\nDou\u00e9 scored twice and set up another goal in little over an hour on the field before being substituted in the second half.\n\nAchraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and substitute Senny Mayulu, the fourth teenager to ever score in a final added to Doue's double as PSG recorded the biggest win in a final in the Champions League's 69-year history.\n\nNow PSG can truly sit alongside the royalty of European soccer. Not by virtue of turnover or merchandising, but on the merits of its achievements on the field.\n\nThe Champions League is the ultimate barometer of the continent's elite clubs and up until now PSG has been a flashy contender that always came up short.\n\nThat all changed at Allianz Arena, the home of Bayern Munich, one of the titans of Europe, and a fitting stage for PSG's crowning moment. Not least because it was against Bayern that it lost its only other Champions League final in 2020, leaving Neymar in tears in an empty stadium in Lisbon where fans were locked out because of the pandemic.\n\nOn this occasion, thousands of PSG supporters were there to revel in the moment, waving flags, lighting flares and drowning out their rivals from Inter, many of whose supporters left the stadium long before the final whistle.\n\nThey had been partying in the streets of Munich throughout the day, but that was nothing compared to the scenes of joy when Marquinhos held the trophy aloft in front of teammates, with fireworks and golden confetti exploding behind them. Celebrations, however, threatened to get out of hand as what looked like thousands of PSG fans had to be stopped from rushing the field by a line of police.\n\nPSG truly delivered when it mattered after so many setbacks in this competition. If there were any nerves from Luis Enrique's players it did not show as they dominated Inter from the start.\n\nIt took just 12 minutes for the French champion to go ahead with a move of speed and precision when Vitinha's threaded pass into the box found the feet of Dou\u00e9. The forward could have shot, but instead slid in Hakimi to tap into an open net.\n\nFormer Inter player Hakimi's celebrations were muted but PSG's fans erupted.\n\nEight minutes later and the lead was doubled \u2014 though this time it relied more on luck than precision as Dou\u00e9's shot from the right of the box deflected off Federico Dimarco and past Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer.\n\nHe got his second in the 63rd, sliding the ball into the bottom corner when through on goal.\n\nKvaratskhelia added a fourth 10 minutes later and Mayulu then found the back of the net in the 86th, just two minutes after coming on to add his name to the list of teenage scorers in a final.\n\nLuis Enrique, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, has become the seventh coach to win the competition with two different teams and follows in the footsteps of greats like Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho.\n\nHe is the 21st coach to win multiple European Cups. In a treble of trophies with PSG this season \u2014 with the Champions League being added to Ligue 1 and the French Cup \u2014 he matched his same achievement with Barcelona 10 years ago.\n\nFor PSG, this moment has been 14 years in the making since it was bought by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 and, awash with newfound riches, started targeting marquee signings to speed up its route to the top.\n\nIn came superstars Zlatan Ibrahimovic, David Beckham and Edinson Cavani. The ante was further upped with the arrivals of Neymar for a world record $262 million, Mbappe and finally Messi, allowing PSG to field possibly the richest array of forwards ever assembled, but still no Champions League trophy to show for it.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nIt was the departure of that last stellar trio over the past two years that appears to have been the turning point, with a greater focus on the team rather than a collection of stars.\n\nNot that PSG's transformation hasn't come at a cost.\n\nIt may make for a nice narrative that PSG has eschewed the big spending approach of before to organically assemble a team to beat all-comers from across Europe. The opposite is true. While it may be without the marquee players of the past, this is still one of the most expensive squads in world soccer.\n\nThe win will also raise more questions about nation state involvement in soccer and so-called sportswashing, given Qatar's lavish backing of PSG in enabling it to conquer Europe. It's victory comes just two years after Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City won the trophy, again against Inter.\n\nSaudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund owns Newcastle, which will return to the Champions League next season with ambitions of its own.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "Sprinter Lachlan Kennedy has become the first Australian in 22 years to legally break the 10-second barrier in the men's 100 metres.\n\nCompeting at the World Athletics Continental Tour Gold meet in Nairobi, Kenya, Kennedy stormed to victory in 9.98 seconds.\n\nThe 21-year-old is the first to achieve the feat since Patrick Johnson's 9.93 Australian record in 2003.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nThere was a false start delay to the race, but that did not phase Kennedy as he refocused to deliver his best performance.\n\n\"It's so good. I can finally say I run 9! I haven't wanted to rush it or put the pressure on myself,\" he said after the race.\n\n\"I take every race as it comes and I knew it would come eventually.\n\n\"I was there to win today and bring it home, and I am super stoked to get the win and the time.\"\n\nKennedy added that he \"didn't think a 9 was realistic until a couple of years ago\" but says he is \"getting better with every race\".\n\n\"I'm looking forward to seeing what I can achieve later in the year as we get closer to the World Championships,\" he added.\n\nKennedy says he is getting better every race. (Getty Images: Gerald Anderson/Anadolu)\n\nOn the track, Kennedy gave a big thanks to his coaching team and training partners.\n\n\"I've got a good coach [Andrew Iselin], good training partners \u2014 shout out to Calab Law, and a good S&C and team around me. It's been about trusting the process.\"\n\nUp next for Kennedy is the Ostrava Golden Spike meet in the Czech Republic on June 24 where he will be joined by fellow Aussie sprint sensation Gout Gout in the 200m.\n\nABC",

    "text": "Max Verstappen has his work cut out to keep his Spanish Grand Prix streak going after Oscar Piastri claimed pole position ahead of McLaren teammate Lando Norris.\n\nThe McLaren lockout of the front row gives the team's drivers a big advantage over Verstappen, whose Red Bull will start tonight's race at 11pm (AEST) from third on the grid in Barcelona.\n\nNew rules for stiffer front wings in the race appeared to have zero impact on McLaren's speed over a single lap. Verstappen was never at the top of the time charts in the final session of qualifying, which turned into another duel between the McLarens.\n\nPoints leader Piastri was behind Norris until he peeled off a blistering final effort and grabbed the edge on the starting grid.\n\nThe race promises to be an equally scintillating fight between the teammates who have won six of the first eight races of the season and put Verstappen's grip on F1 in jeopardy.\n\nPiastri leads Norris by three points in the standings through the first third of the season.\n\n\"It is going to be tough tomorrow,\" Verstappen said.\n\n\"That doesn't mean we are not going to try.\"\n\nIt was the Australian's fourth pole of the season. Piastri leads the field with four race victories, although Verstappen and Norris have topped the last two grands prix.\n\nPiastri won from pole position in China and Bahrain, while he also pipped a pole-sitting Verstappen to win in Saudi Arabia and Miami. His only blemish was losing to Verstappen after taking pole in Imola two rounds ago.\n\nThe sensation of the F1 season blazed to a pace-setting lap in Spain that was two-tenths faster than Norris. Now he must make good on that by protecting his advantage on the long run from the starting grid to the first right-hand corner.\n\n\"It has been a good weekend so far. The car has been mega, and glad to put in some good laps as well,\" Piastri said.\n\n\"It is a long way to turn one so I've got to make sure I make a good start.\"\n\nNorris knows how difficult that can be. He took the pole last year, only for Verstappen to sweep past him at the start and hold on to win the race for a fourth time overall.\n\n\"It is normally interesting, and we have a lot of quick guys behind us,\" Norris said.\n\nRight behind Verstappen, Mercedes's George Russell and Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton start from fourth and fifth.\n\n'Squeezing everything out of the car'\n\nVerstappen, who is 25 points off Piastri's lead, has won at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for the past three years.\n\nBut when asked if he hoped to be closer to his McLaren rivals during qualifying, Verstappen responded with a terse \"no.\"\n\n\"We were lacking all weekend compared to them,\" Verstappen said.\n\n\"I'm here, squeezing everything out of the car. We had a decent Friday, made some final changes to the car but it wasn't enough to challenge for the pole.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nVerstappen had pointed to Barcelona as another race in which he hoped to challenge the McLarens following his win in Italy two rounds ago, and Red Bull boss Christian Horner said his team needed to stay close to the front-runners to have a chance to make gains later in the season.\n\nThe four-time world champion now has to get by both McLarens and hold them off if he wants to cut into their leads.\n\nYuki Tsunoda bottomed out for Red Bull and had the slowest time in the opening segment of qualifying. The Japanese driver will start from last place in a big blow for Verstappen's new teammate.\n\nCarlos Sainz also got culled early and will start from 18th in his Williams. That was the Spaniard's worst qualifying result of the season.\n\nMercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli clocked the sixth-best time, followed by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Alpine's Pierre Gasly, and Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar.\n\nHome favourite Fernando Alonso closed out the top 10 for Aston Martin.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC News: Adam Kennedy)\n\nStudy co-author and associate professor of psychology Amanda George said their report found 64 per cent of share e-scooter users did not wear a helmet \u2014 which she said was linked to a perception that legal consequences and physical injury were unlikely.\n\nPrivate e-scooter riders were observed without a helmet a third of the time.\n\n\"It's not the done thing,\" she said.\n\n\" It's not typical to wear a helmet while riding an e-scooter in Canberra. \"\n\nShe said some users viewed wearing a helmet as \"not cool\".\n\nThe University of Canberra research found e-scooter users also said they chose not to wear helmets because of concerns about hygiene and the helmets sometimes not being available.\n\nThe report made recommendations to the government, including that it should prioritise helmet use by collaborating with e-scooter companies to enforce the rules.\n\n\"A key recommendation we made was to engage in some further research, particularly in those late at night and early morning periods,\" Professor George said.\n\nAmanda George ran focus groups as part of the research. (ABC News: Emily Anderson)\n\nThe ACT government confirmed it was considering the report recommendations, but indicated late-night use was not a focus because e-scooter usage peaks between 4pm and 9pm.\n\n\"Whilst late-night riding may attract some inappropriate use, e-scooters provide an important affordable, flexible and safe service for people who need to travel late at night,\" a government spokesperson said.\n\nBeam or bikes\n\nNeuron Mobility is the sole shared e-scooter operator in the ACT, and the company has 1,075 of its orange scooters scattered throughout the territory.\n\nThe company pays a daily permit fee of $1.04 per vehicle to the ACT government, but the permit expires in August.\n\nAfter an application process in June, the government will consider up to two providers to operate in the territory.\n\nOrange Neuron e-scooters, like these in the CBD, have become commonplace around Canberra.

    "text": "Tomato producers in South Australia impacted by a fruit virus hope to \"rebuild their lives\" as officials concede eradication is no longer possible.\n\nThis week, the National Management Group (NMG) of biosecurity experts and industry representatives decided it was not \"technically feasible\" to eradicate the tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) from Australia after it crossed state boundaries.\n\nPerfection Fresh in the northern Adelaide Plains food bowl region was the first site to detect the highly contagious virus in August.\n\nThe Perfection Fresh farm at Two Wells was impacted by restrictions. (ABC News: Briana Fiore)\n\nAlmost a year on, CEO Michael Simonetta still remembers \"one of the worst days\" of his career when he told nearly 500 employees he had no job available for them.\n\n\"We pulled out 1.2 million healthy plants from our glasshouse and dumped hundred of tonnes of perfectly good, safe, edible fruit,\" he said.\n\n\"It reached the point I couldn't watch it any longer.\n\n\"I feel more for our staff at our site at Two Wells. It was heartbreaking, it was devastating, words failed me.\"\n\nDespite infected tomatoes being safe to eat, Perfection Fresh is one of three South Australian sites that face export restrictions to some states.\n\nVictorian farm Katunga Fresh laid off workers in January when a tomato virus was detected. (ABC Shepparton: Callum Marshall )\n\nThe virus spread to a Victorian tomato glasshouse in January and infested seedlings were in May detected at the same site \u2014 but this time they came from a commercial nursery in New South Wales, a state with no previous links to the virus.\n\nLast week, Victorian authorities said tracing was underway to find out where the infection came from.\n\nIn those two states, hundreds of jobs have been lost and growers have had to destroy thousands of affected plants.\n\nManagement not eradication\n\nThe NMG has focused on eradication but on Thursday agreed it will move to management \u2014 a strategy Mr Simonetta and other growers have long called for.\n\n\"We advocated from day one that this virus needed to be managed and eradication was impossible, we thought, based on what's happening around the world,\" Mr Simonetta said.\n\n\"The reality is growers manage viruses every day of their lives and this is no different.\n\n\"The move now to management will allow all of those businesses to \u2026 get back to business and to rebuild their lives because this decimated a lot of growers.\"\n\nEven so, Mr Simonetta said it would be January or February before his business returned to full production.\n\nClare Scriven says the tomato virus has had a devastating impact on three SA businesses. (ABC News: Justin Hewitson)\n\nSA Primary Industries Minister Clare Scriven on Friday said if the state took a management approach when the virus was first detected, it was \"almost certain\" other local growers would have been blocked from exporting tomatoes interstate.\n\n\"We've been very focused on ensuring that we've had market access for over 200 growers that we have here in South Australia,\" she said.\n\n\"That would continue to be our focus as we move to what's called the management phase.\"\n\nThe tomato virus cuts crop yield by 70 per cent. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\nMs Scriven said the national strategy change was prompted by additional detections interstate but in South Australia, the virus has been contained to three businesses.\n\n\"We've been able to manage access to a number of other jurisdictions for one of those businesses, the other two have not been able to to a large extent,\" she said.\n\n\" For the three businesses it's been incredibly difficult. \"\n\nThe NMG said current strategies to contain the spread remained in place until \"an agreed national strategy for management can be developed in consultation with impacted industries\".",

(Supplied)\n\nShe was one of the vocal supporters cheering the Australian senior and junior teams at the challenge in April.\n\n\"The teams have three and a half hours to create as many beautiful, value-added, retail-ready products as they can, so it's quite incredible to see what the other nations come up with,\" Ms Bouchier said.\n\nThe world's best butchers transform sides of meat into fine dishes. (Supplied)\n\nTeams provided their own seasonings, spices, marinades and garnishes to finish products which had to be eye-catching, easily cooked, and suitable for retail.\n\nMelbourne gourmet butcher Troy Wheeler said his role in the team was to add value.\n\n\"So I get given some different proteins, whether it be chicken, pork, beef, and lamb,\" he said.\n\nTroy Wheeler specialises in value-added meat cuts.

(Supplied)\n\nThird-generation butcher and challenge fan, Ashley Haynes, watched a live stream of the event from Finley in southern New South Wales, where he ran a retail butcher shop.\n\n\"For our Aussie boys to go across there and finish third is just an amazing effort, to play away, an away game on their terms, using their equipment and their produce, yeah, just phenomenal,\" Mr Haynes said.\n\n\"And what that does for the whole industry is reinvigorates all of us along the chain, I think it gives us all a little aspiration to maybe be a part of something like that and that should inspire everybody.\"\n\nAustralia\u2019s full display table at the World Butchers\u2019 Challenge in Paris featured dozens of products meticulously crafted for presentation, flavour and retail appeal.

Uncle Lai\u2019s Tom Piccirillo, Leen Lai and Kian Lai. Markus Ravik \u201cBack then, a lot of Aussies only knew of pad Thai,\u201d Leen says. \u201cI think it\u2019s only in recent years \u2013 maybe the last decade \u2013 when a lot more Australians have travelled to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, that they\u2019ve really come to appreciate char kway teow.\u201d It\u2019s true. These days, Australians definitely know char kway teow, or \u201cCKT\u201d as it\u2019s often abbreviated, and food-focused Brisbane locals will readily debate who does the best. Ya Hoo Dining in Upper Mount Gravatt often gets a shout, and a Malaysian-born former Brisbane Times staffer used to enjoy the CKT at Lemak, which has a few locations dotted around the city. This writer has heard good things about Little Nyonya Kitchen in Ferny Grove, and not a week goes by where I don\u2019t miss the char kway teow from the now-closed Noodle World in Sherwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Star chef Shannon Kellam proves there\u2019s life after Montrachet Still, in 2025, one venue tends to come up more and more when talking about Brisbane char kway teow: Uncle Lai\u2019s. It\u2019s perhaps surprising for a restaurant that opened in 2017, which, with those weird lost years of the pandemic, feels very recent. But Uncle Lai\u2019s story goes back to Malaysia, where Kian\u2019s father, Anthony, worked as a wok cook (the traditional way, over charcoal), and then New Zealand, where the family migrated in 1990 (and Kian and Leen subsequently met). People have travelled from Canada to try Uncle Lai\u2019s char kway teow. Markus Ravik Anthony later opened a restaurant, Malaysian Noodles and Rice House, in Avondale, south-west of the Auckland CBD; over the ensuing years it developed a reputation for cooking some of the best Malaysian food in that city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKian and Leen moved to Brisbane in 2011 after it was decided at a family meeting to introduce their char kway teow into Australia. Still, it took another six years to settle on a location. \u201cIt was a new country so we weren\u2019t sure about investing $300,000 in a shop,\u201d Leen says. Kian Lai working the wok at Uncle Lai\u2019s. Markus Ravik \u201cWe wanted to settle. Also, we travelled to Melbourne and Sydney just to get a bit more of an understanding of the market, and after that we decided on Brisbane,\u201d Kian adds. The original Uncle Lai\u2019s was situated in a poky shopfront on Logan Road in Mt Gravatt. And, true to Leen\u2019s pad Thai story, it took a little while for word of mouth to spread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then a local food blog wrote about Uncle Lai\u2019s. And then the pandemic happened, turning locked down locals towards neighbourhood operators like Kian and Leen. Perhaps the game changer, though, was when the South China Morning Post covered the restaurant via its Goldthread YouTube channel. The Lais are careful to keep secret the specifics of their char kway teow recipe. Markus Ravik \u201cWe did notice that,\u201d Leen says. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously aimed more at a Chinese market, but I think they get a lot American Chinese and Canadian Chinese viewers. We actually had someone from Canada fly in to eat our char kway teow, which amazes us \u2026 they\u2019ve said, \u2018We\u2019re going to fly there and eat this dish.\u2019\u201d So what makes Uncle Lai\u2019s char kway teow so good? You suspect Kian\u2019s years of growing up in New Zealand have lended him the wry, laconic brevity with which he bats away your investigations. The sauce? It\u2019s a secret. The noodles. Secret. The lap cheong? Secret.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe actually had someone from Canada fly in to eat our char kway teow, which amazes us \u2026 they\u2019ve said, \u2018We\u2019re going to fly there and eat this dish.\u2019\u201d Leen Lai \u201cOur rice noodles are direct from the supplier \u2013 his nephew is one of our good friends and customers,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they\u2019re made and the next day they\u2019re on the truck and in our kitchen \u2026 It\u2019s a brand you can get from an Asian grocery, [but] they\u2019ll tend to be two weeks old when you buy theme in the store. If the noodles aren\u2019t fresh you don\u2019t get the same smoothness and bounciness.\u201d \u201cThe lap cheong sausage is locally made in Northern NSW,\u201d Leen adds. \u201cIt\u2019s premium grade. People wonder why we do that but it makes a difference.\u201d It does. There\u2019s no denying Uncle Lai\u2019s Kuala Lumpur-style char kway teow (so, fatter noodles and a darker sauce than, say, a Penang-style CKT) is one of the best in town, and perhaps one of the best noodle dishes, full stop. It\u2019s luscious without being oily, the prawns and chives popping with colour. And you can smell the wok hei as soon as it hits the table. Uncle Lai\u2019s recently moved to new premises in Greenslopes. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s just so much attention to detail, from Kian\u2019s insistence on cooking each CKT individually, to the flecks of fried pork fat that come scattered throughout the dish, adding pops of flavour and texture. In the years following the pandemic, Uncle Lai\u2019s char kway teow became so popular, you often had to order ahead to avoid missing out. But a move last year to larger premises in Greenslopes has helped take the pressure off the kitchen (which, by the way, also punches out a fine laksa and Chinese fried rice. \u201cThe move has been great for us,\u201d Leen says. \u201cWe\u2019ve a few plans for the shop, such as add a shade out front, but otherwise we\u2019re very happy here.\u201d\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

    "text": "There is little doubt things did change due in no small part to the impact of this book. McCaughey referred to this dimension of its influence in his introductory essay for the catalogue of the Field to Figuration: Australian Art 1960-1986 exhibition curated by Robert Lindsay at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1986, observing that \u201cone other aspect of the 1980s has contributed substantial and influential \u2018background noise\u2019 to the changed conditions of Australian art \u2013 namely the rediscovery and revival of the 1940s in Australian art. Part of the stimulus for this revival would include the publication of Richard Haese\u2019s Rebels and Precursors in 1981.\u201d\n\nThe late Robert Hughes, when inscribing a complimentary copy of his book American Visions for Haese, confided: \u201cTell Richard that his book was absolutely pivotal to my own work.\u201d Such cultural impacts had already been anticipated by Brian Johns, the publishing director of Penguin Books (later to become chairman of the ABC). In a letter to La Trobe University (July 16, 1981), Johns wrote: \u201cWe are extremely confident that as a result of Richard Haese\u2019s approach Rebels and Precursors will reach across disciplines and be accepted as a central work by those involved in exploring Australia\u2019s cultural traditions.\u201d\n\nThere are distinct signs that Haese\u2019s second major publication Permanent Revolution: Mike Brown and the Australian Avant-Garde 1953-1997 of 2011 attracted comparable levels of response. The content of the book goes well beyond any biographical coverage and places the reclusive Brown and his work within a nexus of ideas that examine the rise of the radical Imitation Realist movement and explains its connections with postmodernism. When talking casually over dinner about the still unfinished book Brown admitted he felt that \u201cuntil now no one had got me right; I feel finally understood\u201d.\n\nSydney artist Imants Tillers also responded positively to the book in the national art journal Art and Australia (November 2012): \u201cThe genius of Haese\u2019s book is that it traces the development of Mike Brown\u2019s art in relation to the evolving cultural and artistic contexts in which he lived and worked, particularly its portrayal of the counter-culture and the social and political upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 one of the most vital, disputatious and creative periods in Australian art.\u201d I can attest personally to this.\n\nThe effect of these reviews reflected both the breadth and depth of Haese\u2019s observations. Such effects had practical responses. The Heide Museum of Modern Art held a major exhibition of the works of Mike Brown (The Sometimes Chaotic World of Mike Brown, (May-October 2013) where Haese\u2019s pioneering study underpinned both its content and curatorial rationale. Furthermore, what amounted to a Mike Brown festival flourished in a selection of Melbourne\u2019s art galleries: Linden Centre for Contemporary Art, Neon Parc, Utopian Slumps, Charles Nodrum Gallery, Sarah Scout Gallery and Tarrawarra Museum of Art \u2013 all either showed Brown\u2019s works or those of his time {See: Dan Rule, Etched in Shades of Brown, The Age, May 11, 2013.})",

    "text": "The gist of it was querying whether Canberra had overspent by signing a young forward from Newcastle who had made just one starting appearance in the NRL. My argument was that recruiting unproven rookies on big dollars was risky business, and to reinforce the point I referred to a couple of players Stuart had signed at Cronulla, who for whatever reason had not measured up. I wasn\u2019t intending to belittle Stuart, but on reflection I understood why he interpreted it that way. He felt I was having a crack at him, and perhaps more pertinently at the young player they had signed \u2013 a kid by the name of Joseph Tapine. Ricky Stuart with his 2019 Canberra Raiders team, who narrowly lost the grand final to the Roosters. Credit: Getty Suffice to say, nine years down the track, I got that one wrong. Whatever Tapine has cost the Raiders, he has repaid them tenfold. The champion forward has proven to be one of their best signings. I decided the only option was to man up and admit my mistake. I could have texted or emailed Stuart, but I figured the offence I had caused him was in a public forum, so the only fair outcome was to do something I\u2019d never done before \u2013 I wrote a column to apologise.\n\nHe texted a few days later. All was forgiven, and we laugh about it now. I recount the anecdote to give you an insight into the Ricky Stuart I\u2019ve come to know. He\u2019s a man of principle, and he doesn\u2019t tolerate fools. He\u2019s fiercely loyal, and he expects the same in return. He wears his heart on his sleeve, especially after a loss. And he has a remarkable eye for a footballer, which largely explains why the Raiders are second on the NRL ladder at the halfway point in their season. A quick scan of Canberra\u2019s roster reveals the most experienced player they have recruited has been Jamal Fogarty, who had played 39 top-grade games before he was willingly released by Gold Coast, despite having two years to run on his contract. The rest would appear, on paper at least, an eclectic crew of rookies, discards, Pommies and Kiwis, mixed in with local talent. Yet somehow Stuart has this unfashionable Green Machine humming like a Rolls Royce.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the Raiders don\u2019t court established stars. But if a recruitment target thinks the national capital is too cold and boring, then they can go and play somewhere else. Canberra would rather invest in youngsters they can develop. As Raiders CEO Don Furner put it: \u201cThe only big name we\u2019ve ever signed is Mal Meninga [in 1986]. \u201cYou go through all our history, nobody knew who Gary Belcher was, or Gary Coyne, or the Walters brothers when we signed them. Nobody knew who Ruben Wiki was when we signed him from New Zealand.\u201d The same can be said of their latter-day counterparts, such as Kaeo Weekes, Ethan Strange, Matt Timoko, Savelio Tamale, Xavier Savage, Tom Starling, Matty Nicholson \u2026 indeed almost every player in their squad.\n\nFurner said Canberra rely on a \u201cMoneyball\u201d approach, a good scouting network, and Stuart\u2019s ability to take a rough diamond and turn him into a polished gem. The result is a tough, unified, unrelenting and rapidly improving team, built and rebuilt in Stuart\u2019s own image. And that brings me, in roundabout fashion, to a question I\u2019ve been pondering all season: is it now time to acknowledge that Stuart has become a better coach than he was a player? Ricky Stuart was arguably the best playmaker of his era. Credit: Fairfax One of rugby league\u2019s most widely accepted adages is that great players don\u2019t necessarily make great coaches. The likes of Wally Lewis, Mal Meninga, Brad Fittler, Terry Lamb and Wayne Pearce all struggled with the week-to-week grind of running a club. The late Bob Fulton was a notable exception, winning premierships as a player and coach. There\u2019s no doubt Stuart was one of the champion halfbacks of his era. He played in four grand finals with the Raiders, winning three. He steered NSW to four State of Origin series triumphs and, despite the presence of Allan Langer, he wore the green and gold in nine Tests. He would have undoubtedly played more rep football, if not for the Super League war that fractured the game.\n\nAt the peak of his powers, between 1989 and 1994, there was no more dominant force. As former Newtown, Canterbury, Balmain, Western Suburbs and Newcastle coach Warren Ryan put it: \u201cRicky commanded the whole footy field, with those long spirals [passes] \u2026 he put something on everyone, from fullback to front row. If there was an opportunity beckoning a mile away, Ricky would spot it and, bang, he\u2019d put the ball there.\u201d Ryan changed the game with his feared up-and-in \u201cumbrella\u201d defensive system. Stuart\u2019s skill allowed Canberra to overcome it and beat Balmain in the 1989 grand final. Ricky Stuart celebrates with Brad Fittler after winning a title in his first season as a coach with the Rooster in 2002. Credit: Craig Golding After a second knee reconstruction in 2000 forced his retirement as a player, within two years Stuart was a head coach in the NRL, handed the reins of Sydney Roosters at the age of 35.\n\nHe struck premiership gold in his debut season, and could easily have guided the Roosters to a hat-trick of titles. They suffered grand final heartache in 2003 and 2004, losing narrowly to Penrith and Canterbury respectively, but during those seasons Stuart\u2019s team won 59 of the 82 games they contested. At the time, they were as formidable as Penrith and Melbourne have been in recent years. In quick succession, Stuart was coaching NSW and then Australia. Raiders coach Tim Sheens celebrates with Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley after the 1989 grand final. Credit: Craig Golding He left the Roosters after five seasons and joined Cronulla for a four-year stint, guiding them to a preliminary final in 2008. Then followed a season at Parramatta, who were wooden-spooners when he arrived and wooden-spooners when he left a year later. That unhappy tenure was cut short so that Stuart could return home to Canberra, where he has spent the past 12 seasons, in the process becoming only the fifth coach in rugby league history to pass the 500-game milestone.\n\nHe\u2019s the perfect fit, but it hasn\u2019t been an easy gig. Stuart has never coached a Canberra team as strong as the one he played in. Nor do the Raiders have the financial clout he once enjoyed at the Roosters. Yet he took his home-town team agonisingly close to premiership glory in 2019, and this season is shaping as his best opportunity to go all the way. The 58-year-old has zero interest in personal accolades. For starters, he knows that every week in the NRL is fraught with danger, and he doesn\u2019t want to tempt fate. And he insists that any success the Raiders enjoy is because of collective effort, not just from his players, but also the staff. \u201cWe can\u2019t be getting ahead of ourselves, because there\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cIf you lose two or three games in a row, the narrative changes and nobody is interested in you. So that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important to stay very humble.\u201d But he is clearly proud of what his team have delivered this season, declaring after last week\u2019s gutsy win in Auckland: \u201cI\u2019ve got a tough team there, mate. Never once I doubted their toughness or resilience. I know what\u2019s deep under the jumper.\u201d\n\nThe people who know Stuart well, such as his original coach Tim Sheens, are more inclined to give credit where it\u2019s due. \u201cHe\u2019s as good a coach as anyone that\u2019s coaching at the moment, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Sheens said. \u201cHe was obviously a very intelligent player, and you often see that those guys who play in the spine move into coaching. They understand the game, because they run it. And Ricky was certainly one of those players. \u201cHe would call the plays, play by play almost. If the boys got off track, he\u2019d be into them on the field. He was basically coaching as a player.\u201d Ryan, who still calls Stuart from time to time to talk footy, said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anybody other than Ricky doing that job. \u201cHe is Canberra. He\u2019s the heart and soul of the whole thing. How could anybody else possibly coach them? He embodies what Canberra is all about. And the players and people in the national capital who follow league obviously recognise that.\u201d\n\nLoading As for whether Stuart was a better player or coach, Ryan says he has proven himself in both roles. \u201cHe\u2019s a terrific coach, and he was a terrific player,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHow you compare the two, I don\u2019t know. When you\u2019re a player, you\u2019re the beneficiary, or the victim, of your own performance. But when you\u2019re a coach, you\u2019ve got to factor in that you\u2019re the beneficiary or the victim of a lot of other people\u2019s performances, as well. Different beasts altogether. Different beasts.\u201d On that point, Stuart agrees. \u201cI never lose sight of the fact that the success a coach has hinges on the talent of the players he coaches,\u201d he said. During my time in Canberra, I once visited Stuart\u2019s former home in stately Red Hill, in among the embassies and mansions, literally next door to his teammate Bradley Clyde. The treasure trove of mementoes in his snooker room were a reminder of what a player he was: framed Test, Origin and grand final jerseys, as well as the Dally M, Rothmans and Clive Churchill medals.",

    "text": "\u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Webster said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only the start and I\u2019m looking to build on what I\u2019ve started in the Baggy Green. \u201cIt was a bit of a whirlwind. It all went so quickly and I do wish I had soaked it up a little bit more. To be out in the middle with Travis [Head] \u2026 was something I will never forget. To this day, [hitting the winning runs] was my favourite cricketing moment, without a doubt. \u201cI was also very proud to be able to jag a new CA deal. It\u2019s something I probably never thought would happen for a lot of my career. It obviously puts a bit of confidence in me that I\u2019m still in their plans going forward. I\u2019ll be looking to try and repay the faith of selectors and play some more Test cricket for Australia.\u201d As it stands, there is a strong chance Webster will be included in Australia\u2019s XI to face South Africa at Lord\u2019s on June 11. He\u2019s had a steady stint in the UK, with 172 runs at an average of 28.7 to go with 10 wickets at 27.8.\n\nWith Cameron Green not expected to resume bowling duties until the Australian summer, Webster\u2019s all-round credentials play into his favour at the selection table. Green has been in magnificent touch, plundering three centuries in five county championship matches for Gloucester to remind selectors of his value at the top of the order. There is a scenario where Green and Webster slot into the same XI. The latter is certainly hoping so. \u201cHe\u2019s a generational talent and a phenomenal cricketer. He\u2019s only going to get better,\u201d Webster said of Green. \u201cHe\u2019s only 25, so he\u2019s got a lot of cricket ahead of him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what the make-up of the top six is going to look like or which way they\u2019re going to go with in terms of all-rounders, but I\u2019m certainly hoping we can both be in there. \u201cI like testing myself with the Dukes ball in different conditions. Hopefully, I can keep putting my name in front of selectors and become hard to drop out of that XI. That\u2019s probably my main purpose coming over, to keep my game ticking over.\u201d Cameron Green celebrates his 150 in the first Test against New Zealand last year. Credit: Getty If selectors go for the double-pronged option of Green and Webster, either Sam Konstas or Marnus Labuschagne are likely to miss out. Labuschagne\u2019s form for Glamorgan has been patchy, with scores of 0, 4 and 23.\n\nSelectors have flagged that opening with Labuschagne is a live option. \u201cWhen he\u2019s at his best, he\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Webster said of Labuschagne. \u201cHis record speaks for itself. He\u2019s a 100 maker and a game winner. I\u2019m sure going to the top wouldn\u2019t phase him too much. Whoever gets the nod for that final is going to be raring to go.\u201d Over the past few weeks, Webster has had time to reflect on the summer that was. He says he was more nervous joining Australia\u2019s Test squad in Adelaide late last year than actually getting the nod for a debut in Sydney. A solid first-class cricketer for Tasmania, Webster wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever get a look-in for Australia.\n\nA Mitch Marsh form slump ultimately opened the door for the man affectionately known as \u2018Slug\u2019 to be brought in for an SCG decider. Loading \u201cIn my mid-20s, I was pretty happy and resigned to the fact I could just be a really good cricketer for Tasmania. If the top level eluded me, I was pretty content with where I was at,\u201d Webster said. \u201cWe all dream of playing Test cricket. I thought the Australian Test cap was well and truly done. To my surprise I managed to spring a few good seasons together. When the stars do align, you\u2019re not that far from the top level.\u201d All things going well, Webster also could be an important figure for Australia in their three-Test tour of the West Indies, which takes place after the WTC.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAt seven years old, Max was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, a lifelong neurological condition that can cause rapid, involuntary movements and sounds known as tics.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's suffered from bullying at school, leading him to drop out before the end of Year 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ongoing stigma surrounding the condition means Max isn't able to work or volunteer at animal shelters, because employers think his tics might frighten the animals.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Melissa Licari, a senior Research Fellow at The Kids Research Institute Australia, says those experiences are severely affecting Max's mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tourette's took more than just the control of Max's body. It has profoundly impacted mental health. At now 18, Max's mum has lost count of the number of suicide attempts. Max's mother told us Max doesn't want to die, but also cannot live like this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, one in every 100 school-aged children lives with Tourette Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says Max's story reflects the ongoing challenges that young Australians living with the condition have been facing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, Max's story reflects the harsh reality based by meaning living with Tourette's and other tic conditions in this country: long waits for diagnosis, limited access to effective treatment, turned away by the NDIS, stigma, discrimination, not being believed, limited understanding and support in schools and workplaces, and this sadly results in severe mental health issues. These challenges aren't new and they've been ignored for far too long.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ari is a co-author of Impact for Tourette, Australia's first national survey looking at the mental health of people living with Tourette Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt interviewed over 200 individuals and caregivers, finding one in two children with a tic-related disorder has thought about ending their life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it found one in ten children has actually attempted suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also found there is a shortage of psychologists with the expertise to offer treatment for tic disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Amanda Maxwell is a Clinical Psychologist and Clinical Research Manager at the UNSW Tic Clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that lack of psychological services has pushed people to seek medication to treat tic-related disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now medication can be very helpful, but of the sample that we surveyed, 50% said that it did not control their tics or minimally controlled their tics. And there's obvious side effects as well with some of the medications. In terms of the impact on function it was great. So 80% of our survey, those surveyed experienced tic daily and about 50% of the children reported that they didn't have tic-free periods of more than five to 10 minutes in a day - so they're ticcing all through the day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith those symptoms, many living with the condition - like Max - are unlikely to be able to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to Dr Maxwell, they're also struggling to get their NDIS application approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The financial burden is great. It's not just because some adults are unable to work, but there is also a significant cost of accessing healthcare for these young people. One in 20 had NDIS funding. Three out of four had their applications denied. My experience and the experience of other clinicians is that they are denied because tic disorders are not considered a permanent disability, yet even adults we work with - that clearly have tics that have persisted into adulthood and that experiencing significant functional impairment - are also being told that their disability is not a permanent disability and denied funding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year the Tourette Syndrome Association of Australia holds an Awareness Week (June 1-7 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the theme is \"Understand the Impact\", focusing on educating the public on the condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Valsamma Eapen is Scientia Professor and Chair of Child Psychiatry at UNSW Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says while it requires a comprehensive care plan to look after people living with tics, sometimes, even health professionals don't have much awareness of what's needed to support their patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"GPs are usually the first stop, but could also be paediatrics in neurology, psychology, and some will go to the eye specialist if the fast tic is blinking or screwing of the eye, or ENT specialist when they have a vocal tic like grunting or throat-clearing and so on. But often it's not picked up as tics or Tourette, better understanding is critical as currently caught between two main worldviews. One is, oh, tics not to worry, they'll grow out of it. Or Oh, is that the swearing syndrome where people blurt out the obscenities? You don't swear so you can't have Tourette, right? Neither is a helpful approach because the majority would fall somewhere in between.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Eapen calls for more training for professionals, while urging the government to launch a national guideline on Tourette Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A national guideline will provide uniform minimum standards and a consistent approach that's agreed upon by all consumer stakeholders, professionals as to the framework to awareness, early identification, comprehensive assessment, and also matching supports. And that should also include accommodations at school and for disability supports where it is applicable. It is indeed a human rights issue for the 55,000 Australians who are living with Tourettes.\"\n\n\n\n",

Our defense spending must reflect the dangers and threats that we face today. Because deterrence doesn't come on the cheap, just ask the American taxpayer. Time is of the essence. We must step up and move out with urgency. And it's hard to believe a little bit, after some trips to Europe that I'm saying this, but thanks to President Trump, Asian allies should look to countries in Europe as a newfound example.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales government and the state's rail union have struck a deal in the Fair Work Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing almost a year of industrial action disputes between the union and state government over pay conditions, the deal gets workers a 12 per cent pay rise over three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rail, Tram and Bus Union initially sought a 32 per cent pay rise over four years and a 35-hour working week, while the government offered a 15 per cent figure over the same time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransport Minister John Graham told the ABC the result is a win for his government, labelling it a \"fair and reasonable\" wage rise they had promised to deliver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the reasons this deal has landed is that we were one per cent apart when it came to the February negotiations. The government has paid that full one percent to land this deal, we see that as a fair arrangement, it's an investment in reliability. We need a more reliable train service in Sydney, and working with the workforce rather than fighting against them is how we do that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nEleven Sudanese migrants and a Libyan driver have been killed in a car crash.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's understood the accident between the migrants\u2019 vehicle and a truck happened in the desert, 90 kilometres north of the Libyan town of Kufra.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the latest deadly incident involving Sudanese migrants in the Libyan desert.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, seven Sudanese were found dead after their vehicle broke down in the desert on a path used by traffickers between Chad and Libya, stranding 34 migrants on board for several days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexei Popyrin has reached the final 16 at the French Open for the first time after beating Portuguese Nuno Borges in a three hour match.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's now the last Australian man standing after the shock early exit of Alex de Minaur.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s number two ranked player is yet to lose a set on his way to the quarter finals.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says his aim ahead of his next match with American 12th seed Tommy Paul is to keep his mind on his own game.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "At first glance, it seems aimed at the wealthy \u2014 but Labor's superannuation tax plan may have a much broader impact, according to some economists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan, one of the government's key economic policies, is expected to be presented in parliament in the coming months and is proposed to take effect from the start of the next financial year, 1 July.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will hit those with more than $3 million in their superannuation accounts with an extra 15 per cent tax, on top of the 15 per cent all super fund members are currently taxed on their earnings.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The super tax that slipped under the radar during the election campaign\n\n'More and more people will be affected'\n\nThe 30 per cent tax could directly impact 80,000 people, or less than 0.5 per cent of individuals, by 2025-26, according to the Treasury.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this number may increase as people add more money to their super accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The $3 million threshold is set; it won't be indexed or increased over time unless the government announces that. So over time, more and more people will be affected by the tax,\" Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If superannuation returns may remain positive and your fund keeps going up in value ... more and more people will fall over the threshold and be subject to the tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a lot of people who [are] sort of halfway through their career ... They could quite easily hit the threshold within the next 10 years if it's not indexed. And that can have a negative impact.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot indexing the $3 million threshold means it won't increase with inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with The Conversation's Politics podcast, Treasurer Jim Chalmers appeared to indicate the government may choose to raise the threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are so many instances in the tax system where thresholds aren\u2019t indexed, and from time to time governments take decisions to raise those thresholds. I\u2019m anticipating that that\u2019s what would happen here,\" he said.\n\n\n\n'It could affect average Australians'\n\nWhen the plan was introduced in 2023, Treasury said that since most super fund members are unaffected, it aims to \"avoid imposing significant system and reporting changes that could indirectly affect others\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some economists are concerned about the potential impacts of the super tax on the broader economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOliver said the policy \"could affect average Australians\" while \"in theory, there's no impact on those who have less than $3 million\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Tax time countdown: Six things you should start doing now\n\n\"What could happen, though, is that people who are close to it or are beyond the threshold, might think, well, I better start rearranging my superannuation such that I'm not exposed to this tax,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means I take some ... out of the superannuation fund I have, or I put my investments into other parts of the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So there's potentially less investment in the broader economy that could adversely affect economic growth and therefore affect living standards in Australia at a time when we actually want to boost economic growth and boost living standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are all sorts of complications associated with this, which could have unintended consequences for the broader economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Australian Taxation Office figures from 2021, the average super balances for men and women aged between 60 and 64 were $402,838 and $318,203 respectively.\n\n\n\nHow will the housing market be impacted?\n\nOne of the consequences of the super tax, which has been at the centre of the debate, is its potential impact on housing .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tax will cover unrealised capital gains \u2014 meaning people could be taxed each year on the rising paper value of assets like property in a self-managed super fund (SMSF), even if they haven't sold them.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicola Powell, chief of research and economics at Domain, told SBS News this could affect the makeup of property investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is the first time paper gains have been taxed in this way and not the realised earnings. So in essence, it's edging into new territories,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia's new regional hotspot for city leavers as Sunshine Coast slips\n\nShe said that this may lead to SMSFs shifting from the residential market to commercial property, potentially affecting the housing market for both renters and homeowners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that what it could do is increase the number of homes for sale. It could increase the number of residential property listings and ultimately [lead to] fewer rental listings,\" Powell explained.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe believes the outcome may be similar to a potential removal of negative gearing .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The research that's been done for negative gearing does show that removal of the negative gearing will increase rents, but it will increase home ownership and reduce property prices. But the bigger impact is [that] it does increase rent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You could argue that a similar outcome could come from this type of policy, too.\"\n\n\n\n'Makes the system a bit fairer'\n\nOliver said: \"There are many Australians who use their self-managed super funds to invest in startups that could be small businesses or business ideas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a concern that with those startups that there might be less money available for start-up capital from SMSF funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that the issue is not so much an objection to making the system fairer: Yes. Make it fairer, but do it in a way that doesn't create lots of complications.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid the criticism, Chalmers has defended Labor's policy, saying it \"will help us fund our priorities, whether it\u2019s Medicare, the tax cuts, and other priorities in budget repair\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know that people have views about it. I know there's a campaign in a couple of our newspapers about it. But this is all about making sure that it's still concessional treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It makes the system a bit fairer and it's important in terms of the sustainability of the budget.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "President Donald Trump says he will increase tariffs on United States steel imports from 25 per cent to 50 per cent starting Wednesday, to boost local production and reduce the country's dependence on China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move could hinder Australia's exports of the metal by making it more expensive for US companies to buy foreign steel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt could also push up the domestic costs of steel, a key material used in housing, vehicles, and other goods.\n\n\n\nWhat is Trump saying?\n\nIn one of the first big policy moves of his second term back in February, Trump raised steel and aluminium tariffs to a flat 25 per cent rate.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Trump stands firm on tariffs, as markets crash SBS News 07/04/2025 09:12 Play\n\nAustralia has continued its push for an exemption to the penalties, with its goods currently subject to a 10 per cent baseline tariff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're going to bring it from 25 per cent to 50 per cent the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" Trump said at a rally on Friday, announcing the change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our steel and aluminium industries are coming back like never before,\" he added later in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\n\nAustralian cabinet minister responds\n\nMinister for Trade and Tourism Don Farrell responded that Australia's position on the tariffs has been \"consistent and clear\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These tariffs are unjustified and not the act of a friend,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are an act of economic self-harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will continue to engage and advocate strongly for the removal of the tariffs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Australia exported around US$333 million ($519 million) worth of steel and iron to the US, according to an analysis of financial data by Trading Economics.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "United States President Donald Trump has accused China of violating an agreement with the US to mutually roll back tariffs and trade restrictions for critical minerals while issuing a new threat to get tougher with Beijing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump said that he made a \"fast deal\" with Chinese officials in mid-May for both countries to halt triple-digit tariffs for 90 days. He said he did this to save China from a \"devastating\" situation, factory closings, and civil unrest caused by his tariffs of up to 145 per cent on Chinese imports.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE US appeals court allows Donald Trump's tariffs to temporarily remain in effect\n\nTrump did not specify how China had violated the agreement made in Geneva, Switzerland, or what action he would take against Beijing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked later on Friday in the Oval Office about the China deal, Trump said: \"I'm sure that I'll speak to President Xi, and hopefully we'll work that out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a US official told Reuters that it appears China is moving slowly on promises to issue export licenses for rare earth minerals. The deal called for China to lift trade countermeasures that restrict its imports of the critical metals needed for US semiconductor, electronics, and defence production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Chinese are slow-rolling their compliance, which is completely unacceptable, and it has to be addressed,\" US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC, without specifying how that would happen.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, global auto executives began sounding the alarm on an impending shortage of rare-earth magnets from China, used in everything from windshield-wiper motors to anti-lock braking sensors, that could force the closure of car factories within weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, said China has maintained communications on trade matters with US counterparts since the Geneva talks, but raised concerns about US export controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Recently, China has repeatedly raised concerns with the US regarding its abuse of export control measures in the semiconductor sector and other related practices,\" Liu said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China once again urges the US to immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions against China, and jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US has also ordered a growing list of companies to stop shipping goods to China without a license and revoked some existing export licenses, three people familiar with the matter told the Reuters news agency.\n\n\n\nTrade talks 'stalled'\n\nOn Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that trade talks with China were \"a bit stalled\" and that getting a deal over the finish line will likely require the direct involvement of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE From shopping to superannuation: How a US trade war could impact Australians\n\nThe US-China temporary truce to dial back triple-digit tariffs for 90 days prompted a massive relief rally in global stocks, and along with other pauses on Trump's import taxes, has lowered the effective US tariff rate to the mid-teens from around 25% in early April.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was less than 3% when Trump took office in January.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temporary truce between Washington and Beijing, however, had done nothing to address the underlying reasons for Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, mainly longstanding US complaints about China's state-dominated, export-driven economic model.\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor US stock indexes ended little changed on Friday after Trump complained about China's compliance.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\n\u201cDo you sell pad Thai?\u201d Leen Lai lost count of the number of times she fielded this question when she and husband Kian Lai first opened Uncle Lai\u2019s. Uncle Lai\u2019s Tom Piccirillo, Leen Lai and Kian Lai. Markus Ravik \u201cBack then, a lot of Aussies only knew of pad Thai,\u201d Leen says. \u201cI think it\u2019s only in recent years \u2013 maybe the last decade \u2013 when a lot more Australians have travelled to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, that they\u2019ve really come to appreciate char kway teow.\u201d It\u2019s true. These days, Australians definitely know char kway teow, or \u201cCKT\u201d as it\u2019s often abbreviated, and food-focused Brisbane locals will readily debate who does the best. Ya Hoo Dining in Upper Mount Gravatt often gets a shout, and a Malaysian-born former Brisbane Times staffer used to enjoy the CKT at Lemak, which has a few locations dotted around the city. This writer has heard good things about Little Nyonya Kitchen in Ferny Grove, and not a week goes by where I don\u2019t miss the char kway teow from the now-closed Noodle World in Sherwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Star chef Shannon Kellam proves there\u2019s life after Montrachet Still, in 2025, one venue tends to come up more and more when talking about Brisbane char kway teow: Uncle Lai\u2019s. It\u2019s perhaps surprising for a restaurant that opened in 2017, which, with those weird lost years of the pandemic, feels very recent. But Uncle Lai\u2019s story goes back to Malaysia, where Kian\u2019s father, Anthony, worked as a wok cook (the traditional way, over charcoal), and then New Zealand, where the family migrated in 1990 (and Kian and Leen subsequently met). People have travelled from Canada to try Uncle Lai\u2019s char kway teow. Markus Ravik Anthony later opened a restaurant, Malaysian Noodles and Rice House, in Avondale, south-west of the Auckland CBD; over the ensuing years it developed a reputation for cooking some of the best Malaysian food in that city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKian and Leen moved to Brisbane in 2011 after it was decided at a family meeting to introduce their char kway teow into Australia. Still, it took another six years to settle on a location. \u201cIt was a new country so we weren\u2019t sure about investing $300,000 in a shop,\u201d Leen says. Kian Lai working the wok at Uncle Lai\u2019s. Markus Ravik \u201cWe wanted to settle. Also, we travelled to Melbourne and Sydney just to get a bit more of an understanding of the market, and after that we decided on Brisbane,\u201d Kian adds. The original Uncle Lai\u2019s was situated in a poky shopfront on Logan Road in Mt Gravatt. And, true to Leen\u2019s pad Thai story, it took a little while for word of mouth to spread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then a local food blog wrote about Uncle Lai\u2019s. And then the pandemic happened, turning locked down locals towards neighbourhood operators like Kian and Leen. Perhaps the game changer, though, was when the South China Morning Post covered the restaurant via its Goldthread YouTube channel. The Lais are careful to keep secret the specifics of their char kway teow recipe. Markus Ravik \u201cWe did notice that,\u201d Leen says. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously aimed more at a Chinese market, but I think they get a lot American Chinese and Canadian Chinese viewers. We actually had someone from Canada fly in to eat our char kway teow, which amazes us \u2026 they\u2019ve said, \u2018We\u2019re going to fly there and eat this dish.\u2019\u201d So what makes Uncle Lai\u2019s char kway teow so good? You suspect Kian\u2019s years of growing up in New Zealand have lended him the wry, laconic brevity with which he bats away your investigations. The sauce? It\u2019s a secret. The noodles. Secret. The lap cheong? Secret.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe actually had someone from Canada fly in to eat our char kway teow, which amazes us \u2026 they\u2019ve said, \u2018We\u2019re going to fly there and eat this dish.\u2019\u201d Leen Lai \u201cOur rice noodles are direct from the supplier \u2013 his nephew is one of our good friends and customers,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they\u2019re made and the next day they\u2019re on the truck and in our kitchen \u2026 It\u2019s a brand you can get from an Asian grocery, [but] they\u2019ll tend to be two weeks old when you buy theme in the store. If the noodles aren\u2019t fresh you don\u2019t get the same smoothness and bounciness.\u201d \u201cThe lap cheong sausage is locally made in Northern NSW,\u201d Leen adds. \u201cIt\u2019s premium grade. People wonder why we do that but it makes a difference.\u201d It does. There\u2019s no denying Uncle Lai\u2019s Kuala Lumpur-style char kway teow (so, fatter noodles and a darker sauce than, say, a Penang-style CKT) is one of the best in town, and perhaps one of the best noodle dishes, full stop. It\u2019s luscious without being oily, the prawns and chives popping with colour. And you can smell the wok hei as soon as it hits the table. Uncle Lai\u2019s recently moved to new premises in Greenslopes. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s just so much attention to detail, from Kian\u2019s insistence on cooking each CKT individually, to the flecks of fried pork fat that come scattered throughout the dish, adding pops of flavour and texture. In the years following the pandemic, Uncle Lai\u2019s char kway teow became so popular, you often had to order ahead to avoid missing out. But a move last year to larger premises in Greenslopes has helped take the pressure off the kitchen (which, by the way, also punches out a fine laksa and Chinese fried rice. \u201cThe move has been great for us,\u201d Leen says. \u201cWe\u2019ve a few plans for the shop, such as add a shade out front, but otherwise we\u2019re very happy here.\u201d\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

    "text": "There is little doubt things did change due in no small part to the impact of this book. McCaughey referred to this dimension of its influence in his introductory essay for the catalogue of the Field to Figuration: Australian Art 1960-1986 exhibition curated by Robert Lindsay at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1986, observing that \u201cone other aspect of the 1980s has contributed substantial and influential \u2018background noise\u2019 to the changed conditions of Australian art \u2013 namely the rediscovery and revival of the 1940s in Australian art. Part of the stimulus for this revival would include the publication of Richard Haese\u2019s Rebels and Precursors in 1981.\u201d\n\nThe late Robert Hughes, when inscribing a complimentary copy of his book American Visions for Haese, confided: \u201cTell Richard that his book was absolutely pivotal to my own work.\u201d Such cultural impacts had already been anticipated by Brian Johns, the publishing director of Penguin Books (later to become chairman of the ABC). In a letter to La Trobe University (July 16, 1981), Johns wrote: \u201cWe are extremely confident that as a result of Richard Haese\u2019s approach Rebels and Precursors will reach across disciplines and be accepted as a central work by those involved in exploring Australia\u2019s cultural traditions.\u201d\n\nThere are distinct signs that Haese\u2019s second major publication Permanent Revolution: Mike Brown and the Australian Avant-Garde 1953-1997 of 2011 attracted comparable levels of response. The content of the book goes well beyond any biographical coverage and places the reclusive Brown and his work within a nexus of ideas that examine the rise of the radical Imitation Realist movement and explains its connections with postmodernism. When talking casually over dinner about the still unfinished book Brown admitted he felt that \u201cuntil now no one had got me right; I feel finally understood\u201d.\n\nSydney artist Imants Tillers also responded positively to the book in the national art journal Art and Australia (November 2012): \u201cThe genius of Haese\u2019s book is that it traces the development of Mike Brown\u2019s art in relation to the evolving cultural and artistic contexts in which he lived and worked, particularly its portrayal of the counter-culture and the social and political upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 one of the most vital, disputatious and creative periods in Australian art.\u201d I can attest personally to this.\n\nThe effect of these reviews reflected both the breadth and depth of Haese\u2019s observations. Such effects had practical responses. The Heide Museum of Modern Art held a major exhibition of the works of Mike Brown (The Sometimes Chaotic World of Mike Brown, (May-October 2013) where Haese\u2019s pioneering study underpinned both its content and curatorial rationale. Furthermore, what amounted to a Mike Brown festival flourished in a selection of Melbourne\u2019s art galleries: Linden Centre for Contemporary Art, Neon Parc, Utopian Slumps, Charles Nodrum Gallery, Sarah Scout Gallery and Tarrawarra Museum of Art \u2013 all either showed Brown\u2019s works or those of his time {See: Dan Rule, Etched in Shades of Brown, The Age, May 11, 2013.})",

I wasn\u2019t intending to belittle Stuart, but on reflection I understood why he interpreted it that way. He felt I was having a crack at him, and perhaps more pertinently at the young player they had signed \u2013 a kid by the name of Joseph Tapine. Ricky Stuart with his 2019 Canberra Raiders team, who narrowly lost the grand final to the Roosters. Credit: Getty Suffice to say, nine years down the track, I got that one wrong. Whatever Tapine has cost the Raiders, he has repaid them tenfold. The champion forward has proven to be one of their best signings. I decided the only option was to man up and admit my mistake. I could have texted or emailed Stuart, but I figured the offence I had caused him was in a public forum, so the only fair outcome was to do something I\u2019d never done before \u2013 I wrote a column to apologise.\n\nHe texted a few days later. All was forgiven, and we laugh about it now. I recount the anecdote to give you an insight into the Ricky Stuart I\u2019ve come to know. He\u2019s a man of principle, and he doesn\u2019t tolerate fools. He\u2019s fiercely loyal, and he expects the same in return. He wears his heart on his sleeve, especially after a loss. And he has a remarkable eye for a footballer, which largely explains why the Raiders are second on the NRL ladder at the halfway point in their season. A quick scan of Canberra\u2019s roster reveals the most experienced player they have recruited has been Jamal Fogarty, who had played 39 top-grade games before he was willingly released by Gold Coast, despite having two years to run on his contract. The rest would appear, on paper at least, an eclectic crew of rookies, discards, Pommies and Kiwis, mixed in with local talent. Yet somehow Stuart has this unfashionable Green Machine humming like a Rolls Royce.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the Raiders don\u2019t court established stars. But if a recruitment target thinks the national capital is too cold and boring, then they can go and play somewhere else. Canberra would rather invest in youngsters they can develop. As Raiders CEO Don Furner put it: \u201cThe only big name we\u2019ve ever signed is Mal Meninga [in 1986]. \u201cYou go through all our history, nobody knew who Gary Belcher was, or Gary Coyne, or the Walters brothers when we signed them. Nobody knew who Ruben Wiki was when we signed him from New Zealand.\u201d The same can be said of their latter-day counterparts, such as Kaeo Weekes, Ethan Strange, Matt Timoko, Savelio Tamale, Xavier Savage, Tom Starling, Matty Nicholson \u2026 indeed almost every player in their squad.\n\nFurner said Canberra rely on a \u201cMoneyball\u201d approach, a good scouting network, and Stuart\u2019s ability to take a rough diamond and turn him into a polished gem. The result is a tough, unified, unrelenting and rapidly improving team, built and rebuilt in Stuart\u2019s own image. And that brings me, in roundabout fashion, to a question I\u2019ve been pondering all season: is it now time to acknowledge that Stuart has become a better coach than he was a player? Ricky Stuart was arguably the best playmaker of his era. Credit: Fairfax One of rugby league\u2019s most widely accepted adages is that great players don\u2019t necessarily make great coaches. The likes of Wally Lewis, Mal Meninga, Brad Fittler, Terry Lamb and Wayne Pearce all struggled with the week-to-week grind of running a club. The late Bob Fulton was a notable exception, winning premierships as a player and coach. There\u2019s no doubt Stuart was one of the champion halfbacks of his era. He played in four grand finals with the Raiders, winning three. He steered NSW to four State of Origin series triumphs and, despite the presence of Allan Langer, he wore the green and gold in nine Tests. He would have undoubtedly played more rep football, if not for the Super League war that fractured the game.\n\nAt the peak of his powers, between 1989 and 1994, there was no more dominant force. As former Newtown, Canterbury, Balmain, Western Suburbs and Newcastle coach Warren Ryan put it: \u201cRicky commanded the whole footy field, with those long spirals [passes] \u2026 he put something on everyone, from fullback to front row. If there was an opportunity beckoning a mile away, Ricky would spot it and, bang, he\u2019d put the ball there.\u201d Ryan changed the game with his feared up-and-in \u201cumbrella\u201d defensive system. Stuart\u2019s skill allowed Canberra to overcome it and beat Balmain in the 1989 grand final. Ricky Stuart celebrates with Brad Fittler after winning a title in his first season as a coach with the Rooster in 2002. Credit: Craig Golding After a second knee reconstruction in 2000 forced his retirement as a player, within two years Stuart was a head coach in the NRL, handed the reins of Sydney Roosters at the age of 35.\n\nHe struck premiership gold in his debut season, and could easily have guided the Roosters to a hat-trick of titles. They suffered grand final heartache in 2003 and 2004, losing narrowly to Penrith and Canterbury respectively, but during those seasons Stuart\u2019s team won 59 of the 82 games they contested. At the time, they were as formidable as Penrith and Melbourne have been in recent years. In quick succession, Stuart was coaching NSW and then Australia. Raiders coach Tim Sheens celebrates with Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley after the 1989 grand final. Credit: Craig Golding He left the Roosters after five seasons and joined Cronulla for a four-year stint, guiding them to a preliminary final in 2008. Then followed a season at Parramatta, who were wooden-spooners when he arrived and wooden-spooners when he left a year later. That unhappy tenure was cut short so that Stuart could return home to Canberra, where he has spent the past 12 seasons, in the process becoming only the fifth coach in rugby league history to pass the 500-game milestone.\n\nHe\u2019s the perfect fit, but it hasn\u2019t been an easy gig. Stuart has never coached a Canberra team as strong as the one he played in. Nor do the Raiders have the financial clout he once enjoyed at the Roosters. Yet he took his home-town team agonisingly close to premiership glory in 2019, and this season is shaping as his best opportunity to go all the way. The 58-year-old has zero interest in personal accolades. For starters, he knows that every week in the NRL is fraught with danger, and he doesn\u2019t want to tempt fate. And he insists that any success the Raiders enjoy is because of collective effort, not just from his players, but also the staff. \u201cWe can\u2019t be getting ahead of ourselves, because there\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cIf you lose two or three games in a row, the narrative changes and nobody is interested in you. So that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important to stay very humble.\u201d But he is clearly proud of what his team have delivered this season, declaring after last week\u2019s gutsy win in Auckland: \u201cI\u2019ve got a tough team there, mate. Never once I doubted their toughness or resilience. I know what\u2019s deep under the jumper.\u201d\n\nThe people who know Stuart well, such as his original coach Tim Sheens, are more inclined to give credit where it\u2019s due. \u201cHe\u2019s as good a coach as anyone that\u2019s coaching at the moment, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Sheens said. \u201cHe was obviously a very intelligent player, and you often see that those guys who play in the spine move into coaching. They understand the game, because they run it. And Ricky was certainly one of those players. \u201cHe would call the plays, play by play almost. If the boys got off track, he\u2019d be into them on the field. He was basically coaching as a player.\u201d Ryan, who still calls Stuart from time to time to talk footy, said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anybody other than Ricky doing that job. \u201cHe is Canberra. He\u2019s the heart and soul of the whole thing. How could anybody else possibly coach them? He embodies what Canberra is all about. And the players and people in the national capital who follow league obviously recognise that.\u201d\n\nLoading As for whether Stuart was a better player or coach, Ryan says he has proven himself in both roles. \u201cHe\u2019s a terrific coach, and he was a terrific player,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHow you compare the two, I don\u2019t know. When you\u2019re a player, you\u2019re the beneficiary, or the victim, of your own performance. But when you\u2019re a coach, you\u2019ve got to factor in that you\u2019re the beneficiary or the victim of a lot of other people\u2019s performances, as well. Different beasts altogether. Different beasts.\u201d On that point, Stuart agrees. \u201cI never lose sight of the fact that the success a coach has hinges on the talent of the players he coaches,\u201d he said. During my time in Canberra, I once visited Stuart\u2019s former home in stately Red Hill, in among the embassies and mansions, literally next door to his teammate Bradley Clyde. The treasure trove of mementoes in his snooker room were a reminder of what a player he was: framed Test, Origin and grand final jerseys, as well as the Dally M, Rothmans and Clive Churchill medals.",

    "text": "\u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Webster said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only the start and I\u2019m looking to build on what I\u2019ve started in the Baggy Green. \u201cIt was a bit of a whirlwind. It all went so quickly and I do wish I had soaked it up a little bit more. To be out in the middle with Travis [Head] \u2026 was something I will never forget. To this day, [hitting the winning runs] was my favourite cricketing moment, without a doubt. \u201cI was also very proud to be able to jag a new CA deal. It\u2019s something I probably never thought would happen for a lot of my career. It obviously puts a bit of confidence in me that I\u2019m still in their plans going forward. I\u2019ll be looking to try and repay the faith of selectors and play some more Test cricket for Australia.\u201d As it stands, there is a strong chance Webster will be included in Australia\u2019s XI to face South Africa at Lord\u2019s on June 11. He\u2019s had a steady stint in the UK, with 172 runs at an average of 28.7 to go with 10 wickets at 27.8.\n\nWith Cameron Green not expected to resume bowling duties until the Australian summer, Webster\u2019s all-round credentials play into his favour at the selection table. Green has been in magnificent touch, plundering three centuries in five county championship matches for Gloucester to remind selectors of his value at the top of the order. There is a scenario where Green and Webster slot into the same XI. The latter is certainly hoping so. \u201cHe\u2019s a generational talent and a phenomenal cricketer. He\u2019s only going to get better,\u201d Webster said of Green. \u201cHe\u2019s only 25, so he\u2019s got a lot of cricket ahead of him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what the make-up of the top six is going to look like or which way they\u2019re going to go with in terms of all-rounders, but I\u2019m certainly hoping we can both be in there. \u201cI like testing myself with the Dukes ball in different conditions. Hopefully, I can keep putting my name in front of selectors and become hard to drop out of that XI. That\u2019s probably my main purpose coming over, to keep my game ticking over.\u201d Cameron Green celebrates his 150 in the first Test against New Zealand last year. Credit: Getty If selectors go for the double-pronged option of Green and Webster, either Sam Konstas or Marnus Labuschagne are likely to miss out. Labuschagne\u2019s form for Glamorgan has been patchy, with scores of 0, 4 and 23.\n\nSelectors have flagged that opening with Labuschagne is a live option. \u201cWhen he\u2019s at his best, he\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Webster said of Labuschagne. \u201cHis record speaks for itself. He\u2019s a 100 maker and a game winner. I\u2019m sure going to the top wouldn\u2019t phase him too much. Whoever gets the nod for that final is going to be raring to go.\u201d Over the past few weeks, Webster has had time to reflect on the summer that was. He says he was more nervous joining Australia\u2019s Test squad in Adelaide late last year than actually getting the nod for a debut in Sydney. A solid first-class cricketer for Tasmania, Webster wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever get a look-in for Australia.\n\nA Mitch Marsh form slump ultimately opened the door for the man affectionately known as \u2018Slug\u2019 to be brought in for an SCG decider. Loading \u201cIn my mid-20s, I was pretty happy and resigned to the fact I could just be a really good cricketer for Tasmania. If the top level eluded me, I was pretty content with where I was at,\u201d Webster said. \u201cWe all dream of playing Test cricket. I thought the Australian Test cap was well and truly done. To my surprise I managed to spring a few good seasons together. When the stars do align, you\u2019re not that far from the top level.\u201d All things going well, Webster also could be an important figure for Australia in their three-Test tour of the West Indies, which takes place after the WTC.",

    "text": "The prices are in the same ballpark as the local rental market, with a listing for a three-bedroom home nearby actually cheaper than a campsite.\n\nMike Atkinson is petitioning for camping to be affordable for all Australians. Source: TikTok/Outback Mike\n\nAn eye-opening example of the proposed new camping fees in NSW national parks shows how Aussie families will be expected to fork out almost $700 for a week-long camping trip during the school holidays. The shocking increase has experts fearing it will bring family traditions to an end, and rule out camping as the cheap holiday option that it once was.\n\nAdventurer and filmmaker Mike Atkinson, also known as Outback Mike, explained in a video to his followers that under the proposed changes, a campsite in high season would cost $679 per week. Comparatively, he found a three-bedroom house for rent just outside the national park that is listed at $600 a week.\n\n\u201cThe main reason I was making that comparison is that someone is renting out this house and making a profit with all of the infrastructure and building that's gone into a house, and all National Parks has done is clear a patch of ground and put some dunnies and some facilities nearby,\u201d Mike told Yahoo News.\n\nHe also counted 89 campsites on the map, and concluded that a fully booked campsite would create more than $55,000 in revenue in just one week.\n\nMike believes if the changes go through, there\u2019s no going back.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to get cheaper after this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt'll block a whole bunch of people out that just will never be able to afford it. And it will also just discourage young people. Basically anyone who's not middle class with spare cash will really struggle to camp, so it'll just be a trend that less people camp, and it\u2019s for rich people or middle class. It'd be devastating, really, for a lot of people.\n\n\u201cIt'll affect your kids your grandkids and everything. So it's really important.\u201d\n\nThe campgrounds will be categorised into a tiering system based on the facilities available. Source: NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service\n\nThe proposal will categorise all campsites into six tiers based on the facilities available, with each tier being more expensive.\n\nA simple clearing with no facilities will remain free, while campgrounds from tier 2 to tier 5 (which make up 85 per cent of sites) will range from $22 per night in high season for the most basic campground to $65 for sites that have water and access to a flushable toilet. The top campsites, tier 6, which have hot showers and BBQ facilities, will cost $89 per night.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCampsite charges would also be linked to the consumer price index, meaning they\u2019ll increase annually. Seasonal pricing will also apply, with higher rates during peak periods and cheaper fees in the off-season. It would mark the first major fee update since 2017.\n\nNew petition launched to fight proposed changes\n\nLast week, the chance for residents to have their say about the controversial changes came to an end, with more than 23,000 submissions made.\n\nWhile it has caught the attention of politicians, Mike feels like it\u2019s still not enough and has now launched a new ePetition that residents of NSW can sign to keep momentum going.\n\nIn the petition, Mike is pushing to keep camping affordable for all Australians and calls for three key changes:\n\nThe NSW Government should fund national parks adequately instead of relying on camper fees\n\nBooking systems for campgrounds that did not have one prior to Covid should be removed\n\nAn increase in the number of campsites commensurate with park visitation\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOnce an ePetition has more than 20,000 signatures, it must be mentioned in Parliament. Mike is hoping for as many as possible, and said he would be thrilled to see 100,000 signatures.\n\nThe motion is being backed by Nationals MP Scott Barrett, who said it is essential that national parks are \u201caccessible to as many people as possible\u201d.\n\nA house just outside the national park was advertised for rent for $600 per week, almost $100 cheaper than the campsite. Source: TikTok/Outback Mike\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re everyone's assets, not just the top echelon,\u201d he told Yahoo News.\n\n\u201cEveryone should be able to get into a national park, stay there the night, light a fire, roll out a swag and enjoy some of the best country that this state has to offer.\u201d\n\nMr Barrett recently spent six months with his family travelling around Australia with camper trailer where he stayed in national parks, and says this fight \u201cis personal\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe should be encouraging people to get out into these areas, not making it out of reach of a lot of people,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you\u2019re a NSW resident who is interested in signing the petition, you can find it here. It will remain open until August 21, 2025.\n\nNPWS defends camping proposal as review begins\n\nLast week, NPWS assured Yahoo News \"all feedback will be carefully considered\" now the feedback window has closed, and \"consistency and equity\" for campers remains at the forefront of what authorities are trying to achieve.\n\n\"No decisions have been made on the proposal,\" the NPWS spokesperson said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
