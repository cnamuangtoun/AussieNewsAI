    "text": "There's a growing body of understanding around the \ufeffpotential brain health risks of contact sports, but a new study suggests people should add soccer to that category.\n\nRepeated head trauma that can be a result of long-term participation in sports like boxing, and contact football has been linked to chronic traumatic encelaphopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease that can only be diagnosed post-mortem.\n\nWhile the Australian Sports Commission notes more research needs to be done to establish the full context of how a person develops CTE, including genetic and other lifestyle factors, governing bodies for sports such as rugby league, rugby union, and American football have come under pressure over their duty of care to players.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctor who blew whistle on mushroom murderer sanctioned\n\nContact sports have come under scrutiny. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut even as some wary parents \ufeffopt to nudge their children away from contact sports into soccer as a safer option, a new study out of the US has warned that a particular act could also be having a marked effect on players' brains.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, it's the \"header\", the act of projecting the ball forward with a headbutt, that is the culprit.\ufeff\n\nThe new study, published by a research team from Columbia University, found that heading the soccer ball could damage an area at the front of the brain dubbed the \"orbitofrontal grey matter-white matter interface\" (GWI) - a site of changing brain tissue composition.\n\nSoccer headers have been found to also be damaging. (Getty)\n\nResearchers had previously established that repeated head impacts of any sort could be detrimental to the brain, but the precise site where these changes were reflected was not fully understood.\n\nThis time, they investigated 352 adult amateur soccer players, aged between 18 and 55, all of whom had played for at least five years and for at least six months a year currently.\n\nThose who had headed the ball more often had measurable changes \ufeffto their GWI.\n\nREAD MORE: Tsunami warnings after huge Russian quake\n\n\ufeffThey also performed more poorly on a memory test involving remembering a shopping list of items.\n\n\"Soccer is the most popular sport worldwide and, in part due to the practice of heading (i.e, intentionally hitting the ball with the head), may be the greatest source of RHI\ufeff (repetitive head impacts),\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe full study can be found online here .\ufeff",

He fought the ticket at the Disputes Tribunal and won. (Chris Skelton/Stuff)\n\nHe appealed to the company to waive the breach notice, but that was dismissed.\n\nWith the help of ChatGPT, he fought the decision at the Disputes Tribunal, and won.\n\nSmith said he thought the charges were \"obscene\" and the company was being \"predatory\".\n\nREAD MORE: Doctor who blew whistle on mushroom murderer sanctioned by medical regulator \ufeff\n\nSigns displayed outside the laundromat outline the car park terms and conditions.

(Supplied)\n\n\"The photos appear to support Mr Smith's position, that he reversed out of the car park very soon after entering it, presumably once he realised it was a private park with clear warning signs,\" the ruling said.\n\nThe tribunal found Smith had entered the car park, but had not parked there.\n\n\"Accordingly, he is entitled to a declaration that he is not liable for the breach fee or any other cost.\"\n\nSmith shared his plight after reading Loren Phillips' similar story of pulling into the same car park for a total of 27 seconds - a case which also ended in the Disputes Tribunal ruling she did not have to pay a NZ$95 ticket or any associated late fees.\n\nSo, was the parking company in the wrong?\n\nIn both cases, the Disputes Tribunal decided that although their cars had been in the car park, they had not parked there.\n\nTherefore, neither of them were liable to pay.\n\nA Parking Services Limited spokesperson said signage in private car parks served as a clear set of terms and conditions.\n\nSecurity cameras in the laundromat car park.

Failure to comply is considered a breach and often leads to a notice being issued,\" they said.\n\n\"This particular car park is in a high-traffic zone, and the business frequently faces issues with people using its private spaces to access neighbouring businesses. These actions directly impact our client's ability to operate, as their business relies on having vacant spaces available for paying customers.\"\n\nThe spokesperson sent Stuff four examples of Disputes Tribunal rulings it won over the past year, but none appeared to relate to cases in which the driver had been in the park for less than five minutes.\n\nParking Services Limited said signage in private car parks served as a clear set of terms and conditions.

    "text": "Hours after Ben and Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield resigned from the ice cream company he founded nearly five decades ago, his former business partner, Ben Cohen, revealed to CNN why Jerry felt he had to leave.\n\n\"Jerry has a really big heart, and this conflict with Unilever was really kind of tearing him apart. So he felt like he had no choice to resign,\" Cohen told CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich.\n\n\"Jerry's kind of sad that it's come to this, but part of him is feeling a sense of relief that he's no longer in this intense conflict.\"\n\nJerry Greenfield, left, and Ben Cohen, co-founders of Ben and Jerry's, in September 2024, in Philadelphia. (Lisa Lake/Getty Images/File via CNN Newsource)\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Greenfield shared on social media that he was quitting the ice cream company, accusing parent company Unilever of curtailing Ben and Jerry's ability to speak out on social and political causes, which is synonymous with the brand's identity.\n\nThe conflict between the co-founders and Unilever has erupted into public view over the past several years, resulting in lawsuits and publicly posted letters.\n\nBritish-based Unilever bought Ben and Jerry's ice cream for US$326 million ($490 million) in 2000 but allowed the company to operate independently and continue its social mission without interference from its new parent company.\n\nREAD MORE: Jimmy Kimmel yanked off air over Charlie Kirk comments\n\nBen Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerry's, poses with a sign as he protests against the Magnum Ice Cream Company earlier this month. (Shokirie Clarke/Handout/Reuters via CNN)\n\nCohen and Greenfield remained at the company, which they founded in 1978, but not in operational roles. Instead, they focused on the company's social missions.\n\nBut Cohen told CNN that as management at Unilever turned over, no one who signed the deal with Ben and Jerry's remains, and the conglomerate started to disrespect the terms of its unique arrangement with the ice cream maker. Tensions boiled over in recent years as Ben and Jerry's opted to pull its operations from Israel, a decision that was overruled by Unilever.\n\nSince then, the company and its parent have feuded, mostly over politically focused social media posts that Cohen said Unilever opposed \u2013 and threatened to fire people over.\n\nREAD MORE: Sheriff reveals why Charlie Kirk suspect turned himself in\n\nBen Cohen said he supported Greenfield's decision to leave the business. (Shokirie Clarke/Handout/Reuters via CNN)\n\nSpeaking out on political issues, ranging from President Donald Trump to Israel and the Gaza Strip, angered Unilever, which fired the company's chief executive earlier this year.\n\nUltimately, Greenfield had enough. But Cohen said he chose to stay to continue to fight for the company's independence.\n\n\"I'm glad that we're both standing up for the values of Ben and Jerry's,\" Cohen told CNN.\n\n\"I think that I can be most helpful from the inside and and Jerry's going try to be helpful from the outside.\"\n\nDespite Greenfield's exit, Cohen said he is committed to the independent board that helps control the brand and will work to convince its parent company to sell the brand to a group of investors committed to Ben and Jerry's social mission.\n\nREAD MORE: The Epstein files question the FBI Director refused to answer nine times\n\nBen and Jerry's is a brand known for its social activism. (Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg / Getty Images)\n\nBen and Jerry's is currently being spun off from Unilever into a new company called The Magnum Ice Cream Company, which expects to be publicly traded in November.\n\nThe Magnum Ice Cream Company in a statement said it disagrees with Greenfield's and Cohen's perspective, and said it has tried to work with the brand's co-founders.\n\n\"We remain committed to Ben and Jerry's unique three-part mission \u2013 product, economic and social \u2013 and remain focused on carrying forward the legacy of peace, love, and ice cream of this iconic, much-loved brand,\" a Magnum spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nPolitics is profit\n\nA major factor in Cohen's remaining at the company is to keep intact Ben & Jerry's three-part mission: a social mission to support justice and equality, along with a product and financial mission. He says all three are core to the brand \u2013 and claims it's good for business.\n\n\"When we came up with that three part mission, we deliberately wrote it horizontally to make the statement that they are all equally as important,\" he said.\n\n\"As the company acts on its social values and as it produces great ice cream, it ends up making a good profit.\"\n\nUnilever, which doesn't break out Ben and Jerry's sales separately, said in its 2024 annual earnings report that its ice cream division rose 3.7 per cent from the year before.\n\nCohen doesn't regret maintaining its political and social stances, saying that Ben and Jerry's products have a small portion of the market so \"we don't have to appeal to everybody.\"\n\n\"The reality is that businesses are incredibly political,\" he said.\n\n\"The average business, (are) using their money to influence elections, and they're using their money and their lobbyists to influence legislation.\"\n\nHe added: \"The only difference is that Ben and Jerry's political aspects are overt, where we let people know what we think, whereas other businesses are covert.\"\n\nEven with Greenfield leaving the company, the \"spirit of Jerry will always be at Ben and Jerry's,\" Cohen said. And their friendship, which reaches back to junior high when they were the \"two, slowest, fattest kids\" in their class, will endure.\n\n\"I was a failure as a potter. Nobody would buy my pottery. Jerry was a med school reject, and we got together when we were 26 and said, 'Let's try starting a little business. Maybe that'll work.' We ended up starting this homemade ice cream shop in an old gas station in Burlington, Vermont, on an investment of US$8000 ($12,027) and we had no plans to be anything larger than that,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"It's been an amazing ride. It's been an amazing adventure, an amazing odyssey. There's been good times, there's been bad times, there's been challenging times, and we've been through them all together, Jerry and myself, and it's just built a stronger bond between us.\"",

    "text": "A remote community in Western Australia's northern Goldfields is considering a \"bounty\" on domestic dogs amid a spate of attacks.\n\nWiluna, 950 kilometres north-east of Perth, has recorded a string of dog attacks, including six in the past two months.\n\nShire President Peter Grundy said there had been a visible increase in the number of roaming dogs, sparking growing concern from residents about their safety.\n\nMr Grundy said most of the roaming dogs were domestic and had either been abandoned by their owners or given free rein.\n\nSome have also interbred with wild dogs in the area.\n\nIn response, the council is hoping a program of cash payments for animals handed in may reduce the number left roaming.\n\nThe council will hold the dogs until a ranger collects them for transport to Perth for rehoming, where possible.\n\nPeter Grundy says the number of roaming dogs is problematic. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nMr Grundy said the financial incentive would help families surrender dogs.\n\n\"The purpose of it is for the humane control of animals,\" he said.\n\n\"The incentive is for people whose dog is sick or approaching the end of life.\n\n\"We could think of rehoming it or get someone to help us manage it.\n\n\"I think this is the best way to give owners an opportunity to get their dogs screened, professionally assessed and then hopefully the majority of them will be rehomed elsewhere.\"\n\nThe shire says it has received reports of dogs biting. (Supplied: Wiluna Shire)\n\nIt is not the first time Wiluna has introduced a bounty for dogs.\n\nFaced with a similar problem in the early 2000s, the shire offered payments of $20 for fully-grown dogs and $5 for puppies.\n\nMr Grundy said there would need to be a review of those figures.\n\nHe said he hoped the system would be established soon, but there were some hurdles to be addressed.\n\n\"We have got to build a proper dog pound with all the cages and assign officers hours to feed them and look after them,\" he said.\n\n\"All of this has to be done to a high standard.\"\n\nDogs roam in groups in the streets of Wiluna. (Supplied: Wiluna Shire)\n\nVet services a challenge\n\nShire chief executive Matt McIntyre said the shire had a ranger program that visited for one week each month.\n\nWhile the shire was attempting to rehome some dogs, Mr McIntyre said the increasing dog numbers was making it challenging.\n\nMurdoch Veterinary Hospital staff have been travelling to Wiluna annually as part of an outreach program, providing desexing and other preventative health services in a bid to help address the dog population problem.\n\nStudents from Murdoch University provide free sterilisation to dogs in Wiluna. (Supplied: Nicole Laing)\n\nVet Nicole Laing, who coordinates the Murdoch program, said the council proposal was well-intentioned, but could potentially have a negative impact.\n\nDr Laing said payments could create an incentive to breed more dogs.\n\nThe council is considering a bounty to encourage people to surrender unwanted dogs. (Supplied: Wiluna Shire)\n\n\"Community members will see it as a way of gaining financial support and will deliberately breed animals to be able to provide for another, becoming a backyard puppy farm,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's really important that people closely look at the consequences of offering a reward for someone to give up their extra pets.\"\n\nShe said the best course of action was to ensure the animals were being properly cared for.\n\nStudents from Murdoch University's On the Road program provide free sterilisations. (Supplied: Nicole Laing)\n\n\"If dogs aren't getting appropriate food and resources, they start to move into another dog's territory and that's when you're going to get dog fighting,\" she said.\n\nDr Laing said the idea of rehoming dogs was a step in the right direction, however, new owners should understand the work required to help these dogs adapt to urban life.\n\n\"I think if people are taking these animals on in this rehoming situation, they have got to be prepared that they may have to seek extra resources to enable a happy pairing,\" she said.",

An independent audit of one of Victoria's biggest Chinese language schools finds a list of financial mismanagement issues.\n\nThe warrant was obtained under the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission Act on September 4, and the ABC confirmed the search took place on September 11 and went for about five hours.\n\nAn IBAC spokesperson said the commission \"does not comment on whether it has a complaint or investigation before it\".\n\nThe warrant authorised a search of a sweeping list of records related to language school operations, including documents, business records, financial documents, diaries, meeting notes and computers.\n\nMedia containing files or documents including encryption devices were also listed on the warrant.\n\nIn an email sent at 11:50pm on September 18, XJS chairperson Haoliang Sun told the ABC he was overseas and \"not sure what has happened\".\n\nXJS is one of the biggest community language schools in Victoria, with about 3,000 students.\n\nChinese teachers underpayment allegations Photo shows A profile photo of woman in a green jumper who is looking at the camera.

(ABC News: Kimberley Putland)\n\nIn the letter, sighted by the ABC, Water Corporation said it would not support a proposed expansion of the Beachfront Village accommodation development due to a \"water-supply constraint issue\" caused by demand on the source.\n\n\"The scheme is currently at effective capacity with its existing groundwater sources, which are impacted by climate factors,\" the letter states.\n\n\" Any new major connection requests cannot be accommodated until the scheme has additional source capacity. \"\n\nWater Minister Don Punch has been contacted for comment.\n\nPort Hedland's existing sources of water. (Supplied: Water Corporation)\n\nLocals left out to dry\n\nPilbara Tourism Association chair Barry Harrison said it was disappointing for the town, which is already facing a shortage of accommodation.\n\n\"We desperately need more tourism accommodation here in Port Hedland and any lack of perceived water supply is obviously going to impact that and other major projects,\" he said.\n\nBarry Harrison says the town can't grow without water. (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\n\"Water is the source of life and without that we can't do anything, let alone building new accommodation, you know, new hotels, new accommodation for local people.\n\n\"If that's what Water Corp is telling the council it's quite disappointing that there's not some plans in place or afoot. There should have been years ago to resolve this problem.\"\n\nPort Hedland's drinking water is supplied from two groundwater bore fields, with allocation of the region's scarce water resources already under public scrutiny this week.\n\nMichael Thompson is a pastoralist at Mundabullangana Station, Port Hedland. (ABC News: Michelle Stanley)\n\nMichael Thompson's Mundabullangana Station is located above the the Yule River bore field, which is controlled by the Water Corporation.\n\nThe pastoralist told ABC Radio Perth this week he was drilling deeper and deeper to access water for his cattle on the station, once renowned for its water quality.\n\nAlternative sources long away\n\nWater levels in another dam near Karratha, 240 kilometres west, have dropped by 19.5 per cent this year.\n\nWhile the Harding Dam, south of nearby Roebourne, sits at just 21.6 per cent capacity.\n\nHarding Dam is one of Karratha's water sources and has dropped by nearly 20 per cent from last year. (ABC News: Stephen Stockwell)\n\nWater Corporation said declining inflows into Harding Dam were entirely climate driven, with no significant recharge since April 2022.\n\nA spokesperson told the ABC it was investigating new drinking water sources, including the likely construction of a desalination plant.\n\nBut in the letter it said the new source was not expected until the early 2030s, with capacity constraints to remain until then.\n\nWA Nationals leader Shane Love said it was baffling the situation had been allowed to deteriorate by the Water Corporation and WA government.\n\nShane Love says it is a \"disgrace\" that Port Hedland's water supply was allowed to reach capacity. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"I'm absolutely dumbfounded that in the town of Port Hedland \u2026 there has not been the far-sightedness to actually provide sufficient water for the growth of the town,\" he said.\n\n\" It means that Port Hedland can't grow.

    "text": "No live export vessels are scheduled to take sheep from Australia to the Middle East for the rest of 2025, raising speculation an unofficial end to the trade could come ahead of a legislated ban in 2028.\n\nThe three-month northern summer moratorium on live sheep exports to the Middle East ended last weekend, a milestone normally marked by a flurry of activity at Fremantle Port, with sheep ships docked and ready to take on animals.\n\nBut this year is very different.\n\nWA Livestock Exporters' Association chair John Cunnington said not one livestock vessel is confirmed to return to Australia between now and the end of the year.\n\nHe pointed to \"unprecedented circumstances\" in the market, including high sheep prices and Western Australia's shrinking sheep flock.\n\n\"It doesn't mean they won't come,\" he said.\n\n\"But the tight supply and high prices and everything else that goes on in the live export space with regulation is making it extremely difficult at the moment.\"\n\nNo sheep ships are scheduled to depart Fremantle Port between now and the end of the year. (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\nMr Cunnington told the ABC the situation was unusual.\n\n\"The trade's always had a reliable history of running ships backwards and forwards between Fremantle and the Middle East, and that's been happening for decades,\" he said.\n\n\"Even in recent years, since the northern summer cessation period started [in 2019], we've always seen ships either ready here to go as soon as the period is lifted, or planning to come back.\n\n\" So to not hear of any shipments planned currently is pretty unprecedented. \"\n\nMr Cunnington said between September and December last year, 145,000 head of sheep were exported by ship, with this year's figures set to plummet by comparison.\n\n\"You're probably looking at 50,000 to 100,000 [head], so you're looking at a third to two-thirds less,\" he said.\n\n\"The demand is definitely there from the Middle East, it's just whether we can commercially make this all work.\"\n\nThe beginning of the end?\n\nLast year, the Australian government announced live sheep exports by sea would be phased out over a four-year period.\n\nMr Cunnington said he did not necessarily think the current situation indicated the end of trade before then.\n\nBut he said the ban was worrying sheep producers and prompting many to leave the industry.\n\n\"[The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development's] flock modelling shows WA's sheep flock went from 12.4 million in mid-2022, and it's declined to 8.6 million in July 2025,\" he said.\n\nJohn Cunnington heads WA's Livestock Exporters' Association. (ABC News: Ruby Littler)\n\nWhile DPIRD mainly attributed this to dry seasonal conditions, Mr Cunnington said uncertainty around the government's looming ban on the live sheep trade had heavily contributed.\n\n\"Agriculture runs on confidence and this decision [to ban live sheep exports] \u2026 really spooked and put uncertainty into the markets,\" he said.\n\n\"And producers acted accordingly.\"\n\nPrices unsustainable\n\nFigures released by Meat and Livestock Australia last week showed sheep transactions at WA's largest sheep selling centre, Katanning Regional Saleyard, increased by 100 per cent year on year from 2023-24 to 2024-25.\n\nYork sheep farmer Peter Boyle said he was concerned the current near-record sheep prices were unsustainable.\n\n\"It's very hard to see our way clear to get a good margin because we don't know where the market's going to go,\" he said.\n\nMr Boyle farmed sheep for almost 60 years, but recently shifted his focus to crop farming to try and future-proof his livelihood.\n\nHe said he was not alone.\n\n\"There are eight of my neighbours who have gone out of sheep farming,\" he said.\n\n\"Dams have been filled and they've said they're not going back.\"",

    "text": "Australia has recorded another first at the World Athletics Championships, with three women progressing to the 800m semifinals for the first time.\n\nClaudia Hollingsworth finished third in her heat to qualify automatically.\n\nAbbey Caldwell missed third in her race by 0.08 of a second, but managed to progress as the second-fastest non-automatic qualifier.\n\nBut the wait was perhaps even more agonising for Jess Hull after she took a hard tumble in the final heat of the night.\n\nClaudia Hollingsworth was the only automatic qualifier of Australia's three women's 800m semifinalists. (Getty Images: Christian Petersen)\n\nOn the cross, as the pack comes together from their starting staggers, Hull was last but pushed up to join the group.\n\nHull quickly filled the space in between Canada's Ma\u00ebliss Trapeau and South African runner Prudence Sekgodiso, copping a nudge from Trapeau into Sekgodiso.\n\nThe field settled into stride after that, with Hull, riding high after her 1,500m bronze medal, ready to launch for a personal best.\n\n\"I kind of took a second to myself where I was like, 'I'm right in this', which I knew I could be,\" she said.\n\n\"The first 200m is the hardest part of the race and to put myself right in it, I was like 'OK here we go'.\"\n\nBut, after that tricky first half-lap, disaster struck.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nIn the inside lane, eventual winner Natoya Goule-Toppin suddenly had to hop right, seemingly to avoid clipping the back of German Majtie Kolberg's feet.\n\nThat appeared to send her bumping into Sekgodiso, with the small nudge sending the South African's legs into the left ankle of Hull at the worst possible time and the Australian belly-flopped hard onto the track.\n\nJess Hull went down just after 200m mark of the race. (Getty Images: Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu)\n\nIt all happened so fast that even Hull was not 100 per cent sure what had happened immediately after the race.\n\n\"I was running and next second I knew I was on the ground and the whole pack was leaping over me,\" she said, adding she felt someone clip her back foot mid-stride.\n\n\"I got up on instinct, but in the 800m you're not gonna get those women back, they are so fast. The race was gone but I was like 'well I owe it to myself to finish the race'.\"\n\nThe field ran away from her, but Hull made sure she finished. (Getty Images: Pat Scaasi/MI News/NurPhoto)\n\nAnd finish she did, well behind the rest of the field except, ironically, Sekgodiso, who dropped off the back in the second lap and was left in tears after she was unable to finish the race due to a hamstring injury.\n\nHull, with a small gash on her right leg from her spikes, jogged on to come home in 2:13.42, comfortably the slowest of the 55 finishers across the seven heats.\n\nThankfully for her and Australia's tilt, an appeal was upheld by the referee and she progressed to the semis alongside Hollingsworth and Caldwell.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe 28-year-old from Wollongong said she did not blame anyone for her stack, but was entitled to another chance.\n\n\"It's racing, but there's nothing different I could've done,\" she said.\n\n\"I was taken out from behind so I think personally I haven't done anything wrong.\n\n\"It's not the fault of the pack either, that is racing, but I didn't get a chance to even run myself through.\"\n\nThe women's 800m semifinals are tonight, with Hollingsworth at 9:43pm AEST, Hull at 9:52pm, and Caldwell running from 10:01pm.",

    "text": "The most famous saying in football might be its most time limited \u2014 \"we'll take it one week at a time\".\n\nIt's a phrase that's uttered countless times across the course of a season, surpassing other catchcries like \"we gave it 100 per cent\" and \"it's a game of four quarters\".\n\nIt is in this week that the saying means most of all. While fans are busy registering for the grand final ballot and making BBQ plans with friends, coaches and clubs will be drilling players not to get ahead of themselves.\n\nBecause falling in the preliminary final can be even more painful than losing on the big day \u2014 so close to the final reward but with little to show for it.\n\nGeelong knows this pain more than most sides. The Cats have made preliminary finals in eight of the past ten seasons, including this year.\n\nThey've managed to win just two of those seven matches, with their season finishing painfully short on five occasions.\n\nHawthorn is less familiar with this stage in recent years.\n\nIt has been a full decade since the Hawks' last flag, and their last visit to the final four.\n\nIn that time Hawthorn has rebuilt and retooled, with Jack Gunston the last holdout from that 2015 premiership. After an abbreviated visit to the finals last year, this year's Hawks are determined to leave their mark on the competition.\n\nAt this time of year match-ups become incredibly important, alongside how you adjust to the team you are set to beat.\n\nWhile Geelong have had the upper hand in recent years against the Hawks, the gap appears to be closing fast. This year the Cats won their only match by a heart-stopping seven points.\n\nThat sets the stage for a mouth-watering battle between two well-matched opponents.\n\nBoth the Hawks and Cats will be looking to lean on their strengths to make it one more week to the grand final.\n\nThe rising Hawks\n\nHawthorn entered the year in the mix for grand final favourites before sliding through the middle of the year.\n\nAfter two impressive finals efforts the Hawks see themselves with just their closest recent rival in the way of their first grand final visit in a decade.\n\nThe Hawks have built their success slowly but surely, recruiting talent from somewhat unlikely places.\n\nStar forward Gunston left Hawthorn for a year in Brisbane before returning. His forward line foil, Mabior Chol, has firmly found his place in the league at his third club.\n\nTheir engine room is led by mid-season rookie pick up Jai Newcombe, alongside Irish recruit Conor Nash.\n\nJack Gunston has led the forward charge for the Hawks, but they boast several danegrous avenues to goal. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nWhile the Hawks have made the most of their high draft picks, it's how the talent has come together that has spurred them to success.\n\nThis year, the strongest parts of their game have happened not through the middle of the ground, but instead inside the arcs.\n\nHawthorn's marking inside 50 rate sits second in the league with the Hawks notable for the spread of their threats rather than a dominant figure.\n\nTalls and smalls have all found space to work in. Gunston has kicked a career high 70 goals this year, but he's far from playing a lone hand up forward.\n\nIt's the wide range of targets that the Hawks deploy up forward that have created extra space for the Hawks veteran, and what makes them such a deadly proposition.\n\nAt the other end of the ground, Hawthorn's defence has been equally stout. They've paired their forward marking prowess with stingy defence against deep marks. They concede the fewest points per entry inside 50 amongst the sides left this year.\n\nHowever, this stingy defence has come at a cost. A strong defence-first approach hasn't always been effectively paired with creating strong threats going the other way.\n\nThe balance between defence and counterattack is hard to get right.\n\nHawthorn has struggled to capitalise once they win the ball back. They are the only finalist who sits below league average in points scored per intercept.\n\nThe Hawks have particularly stalled after defensive half intercepts, sitting 12th for scoring per attempt. Without a potent defensive half counterattack, teams can get a bit more aggressive with their attack.\n\nAt face value, Geelong \u2014 the best side at exploiting short field turnovers \u2014 would be the hardest test for a side that sometimes struggles to move the ball up the ground.\n\nIn their round six match-up, the Hawks were solid at moving the ball up the ground, but gave up 14 front half scoring shots to sink their hopes.\n\nTo have a shot at beating the favourites they have to make sure they can move the ball safely down the ground.\n\nThe always present Cats\n\nAs the season has developed, expectation of something special has slowly grown down at Kardinia Park. Seemingly every year that passes is followed by speculation of whether this is the year that the Cats finally slide down the ladder for good.\n\nAt this rate that fall may never happen.\n\nJeremy Cameron's year has been special, but the veteran has been ably supported by Geelong's rising stars. (Getty Images: Morgan Hancock)\n\nWith a host of talented youngsters like Max Holmes supplementing veterans like Jeremy Cameron and Patrick Dangerfield, the Cats shape as maybe the team to beat this year. And it's not just the talent that is driving their 2025 success.\n\nGeelong has long been considered the most inventive side in the competition in terms of set up and execution.\n\nChris Scott and the Cats often leave opposition coaching staff scratching their heads with how they deploy their side.\n\nFrom defensive match-ups to ball movement, the use of rucks and how they generate spare defenders, the Cats are a tough problem to solve, especially in the finals.\n\nThese quirks can often manifest in one way in particular \u2014 opposition mistakes and Geelong goals.\n\nGeelong has been the most prolific team scoring from turnovers this season, with the Cats causing problems with turnovers forward of the centre square.\n\nGeelong's group of forwards force opposition sides to pick their second or third choices when trying to move the ball out of defence. The Cats upfield defence also works like a trap in creating repeat inside 50 entries.\n\nWhen entering the 50 the Cats manage to find their way towards the hotspot more than any other side. With a deep and talented forward line \u2014 led by All-Australian captain Jeremy Cameron \u2014 the Cats can force the ball into valuable spots close to goal.\n\nThe Cats have 50 per cent more set shots per game inside 15m of any other side this year other than Brisbane. For opposition sides it's often about triaging damage rather than stopping the onslaught.\n\nLike all other teams the Cats are beatable, even if they are more complete than most other sides.\n\nThe Cats prioritise around the ground flexibility from their ruck division, sometimes cruelling their ability to win first possession from stoppages.\n\nThey will often run one ruck at centre bounces before deploying them behind the ball or deep forward, while a second tall will take over the primary ruck work around the ground. This creates an advantageous mismatch in general transition play, but does come at a cost at the initial contest.\n\nIn addition, the Cats deploy a large number of prime movers and defensive options at contest, often leaving them at a disadvantage at winning the ball at the coalface.\n\nLoading...\n\nUsually these other elements can more than compensate from the loss of raw volume, but at times it can starve them of field position.\n\nEarlier this year against the Hawks they were able to overcome this first possession weakness, winning that battle 43 to 35. However, they struggled to get the ball to the outside, losing the clearance battle. That led them to losing the territory battle across the game.\n\nWhile Geelong held on for a narrow win, it provided a real pathway for the Hawks to build upon for this week.\n\nThere's also sometimes a sense that the Cats can be too reactive to what other sides are doing instead of forging ahead with their own identity.\n\nRather than having something tried and tested to fall back on when in trouble, they seem to try to solve problems on the fly.\n\nThat may not hold up as well in September as it does in May.\n\nABC Sport will be live blogging and calling all of the action from tonight's preliminary final, with the game set to start at 7:40pm.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Ash Centra had no idea she\u2019d gone viral. The 19-year-old Collingwood rookie woke up the day after her debut game against Carlton at Ikon Park in August and redownloaded Instagram, an app she ritualistically deletes before games to block out external noise and clear her mind. Collingwood\u2019s Ash Centra Credit: Joe Armao Her inbox was jam-packed with an infinite number of hashtags, reels and messages from family, friends and complete strangers. Centra took a mark and booted her first major in the clash, but the most talked about moment was an innocuous move she made during a warm-up. While jogging, the rookie threaded the ball behind her back and bounced it between her legs \u2013 an impressive manoeuvre that would have impressed on a basketball court, but bamboozled with a Sherrin. \u201cI saw that people were tagging me in all these videos of the bounce, I was just like, this is ridiculous. Like, this cannot be happening,\u201d Centra told this masthead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin days, nearly everyone was attempting the bounce, including Hawthorn coach Sam Mitchell and Collingwood\u2019s Nick Daicos, Jack Crisp and Darcy Cameron. So where did the move come from? \u201cI think it\u2019s been something I\u2019ve aimed to master for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t really remember the exact moment when I started, but I think it\u2019s just a fun little thing to do during training or even during the warm-up. I think I was just lucky to be getting filmed whilst doing it, because it\u2019s definitely helped with all the hype.\u201d Like all No.1 draft picks, Centra entered the league with significant noise. A product of the AFLW\u2019s first national draft class, Centra was a star midfielder for Gippsland Power and was named the Coates Talent League\u2019s best and fairest in 2024. After her debut game, Collingwood coach Sam Wright quipped Centra had already developed a cult following, noting the gigantic cheer when she finally came off the bench to play. \u201cLooking back and reflecting, it was definitely probably the biggest highlight of my night, hearing that roar,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamily and friends from Centra\u2019s hometown Seaspray \u2013 a small coastal town in Gippsland \u2013 had made the three-hour trek to see her debut in Melbourne, including her twin brother Luca. Centra credits her brother for her love of footy. The twins grew up playing junior footy together and their competitive natures meant they pushed each other to be the best. Luca was in the stands cheering during Centra\u2019s debut, but accidentally missed a rather pivotal moment. \u201cDad came up to me after the game and said my brother was in the bathroom while I was having a set shot on goal, and unfortunately, he missed it, but my mum filmed it so he got to see afterwards,\u201d she laughed. Since that debut game, Centra has continued to impress, collecting a Rising Star nomination for her role in Collingwood\u2019s shock 26-point victory over the formerly undefeated Swans last week. Centra picked up a Rising Star nomination for her efforts in the round five clash with Sydney. Credit: Joe Armao Centra is full of praise for the team\u2019s new captain Ruby Schleicher, describing the dual All-Australian as the perfect leader who strikes the balance between having fun and being professional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI say this in a humble way, there\u2019s obviously a lot of attention on the first couple of picks in the draft, because you\u2019re expected to go out there and obviously try and change the game in some aspects,\u201d Centra said. \u201cRuby\u2019s been a massive mentor for me. She\u2019s guided me, and she\u2019s just super inclusive and super approachable when I need help, not only on the field but off the field as well.\u201d Last week Schleicher told this masthead rookies and top draft picks such as Centra were coming into AFLW with more pressure and noise than ever. \u201cSo within the four walls and as a leader, it\u2019s probably just my job to try and release that pressure and let them know that we don\u2019t need them to go out have 30 disposals and change the game,\u201d Schleicher said. \u201cWe just want to see them grow as players and enjoy their football.\u201d Centra models her game off Richmond best-and-fairest winner Monique Conti, adhering to a silky and versatile style of footy. However, the physical nature of AFLW has been a surprising adjustment. \u201cI came in on the first day of pre-season, and Britt Bonnici tackled me, and I was so taken back and shocked [by] how hard they hit,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading \u201cBut I think it really helps you understand where you\u2019re at and it helps you build that level of physicality. And I also think the speed of the game is so much different to what I\u2019m used to, but it\u2019s been a great challenge.\u201d Centra is also adjusting to the recent move to Melbourne and is currently living with family friends. The 19-year-old was born metres from the beach and misses swimming in the ocean, joking Melbourne\u2019s city beaches aren\u2019t quite the same. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot different to what I\u2019m used to. I know country life and city life are polar opposites ... so it\u2019s been an adjustment,\u201d she said \u201cIn Seaspray there\u2019s only like 300 residents, so everything\u2019s slow,\u201d she continued. \u201cNothing\u2019s really happening. We\u2019ve got one coffee shop, and then you come to Melbourne and there\u2019s like, 50 coffee shops metres from your house.\u201d Centra was looking forward to taking on Hawthorn at Victoria Park on Saturday in front of her family and friends, including her brother. \u201cHe\u2019s coming this weekend, so hopefully I\u2019ll kick him a goal that he\u2019ll see,\u201d she joked.",

    "text": "The AFP conviction was later quashed due to Nicola\u2019s nefarious needling. While the Commonwealth prosecutors felt they had enough for a retrial, they decided to let it go because he had done his time. Mokbel pleaded guilty to Quills, Orbital and Magnum. The remaining charges were dropped. For Tony, it was the best deal since Aldi sold snow ploughs for $99. It is entirely possible justices Stephen McLeish, Maree Kennedy and Stephen Kaye will decide that the Quills and Orbital convictions should be flushed down the toilet. Which brings us back to the toilet at the Box Hill restaurant and the naked face-off (although they weren\u2019t exactly facing off).\n\nThe chubby chap, built more like Billy Bunter than Billy the Kid, was Tony Mokbel\u2019s right-hand man, Bart Rizzo, and the second man was \u201cAndy Hossack\u201d, an undercover police officer. Artist sketch of Bart Rizzo in court. Rizzo was understandably self-conscious. Much later at his criminal court plea hearing, his lawyers would say he had battled weight problems since he was a child. Sad, but hardly mitigation as I have yet to see any criminological research linking the consumption of Mars bars with the production of methamphetamine. \u201cAndy\u201d had infiltrated the Mokbel syndicate, introduced by a trusted insider who was secretly working for the police. The insider, a musician, became Registered Human Source 3030. The musician was a great mate of Rizzo but a million-dollar reward on Tony\u2019s toupee-covered scalp persuaded him to work for the police.\n\n\u201cAndy\u2019s\u201d cover story was that he worked at a university and could steal large glass reactors that Mokbel\u2019s team needed to produce speed. It was late May 2007 when Andy first connected with the Mokbel syndicate, known as The Company. Rizzo was chief financial officer for The Company. He kept the books, chased the money and resolved the problems. His fellow executive was Joe Mansour, the operations manager. They had been firm friends since they were private school classmates. As Justice Betty King would later observe when sentencing Rizzo: \u201cYou and other company members ran \u2018The Company\u2019 as if it were a legitimate business.\u201d While Mokbel was a self-taught and quite brilliant businessman, Rizzo embarked on a Swinburne University business management course, dropping out in the final year \u2013 no doubt because there wasn\u2019t a unit on money laundering.\n\nRizzo provided a list of glassware and \u201cAndy\u201d produced two consignments for $7300 cash from the Mokbel coffers. Loading But \u201cAndy\u201d was not masquerading just as an opportunistic thief but also as a drug dealer looking for a product that Rizzo could provide. Trouble was, The Company had lost its two best speed cooks (three if you include Tony, who was pretty good on the tools). For years, Mokbel produced the best gear going about, but something had gone wrong. Customers were complaining about the smell of the latest batch, and some had been hospitalised.\n\nRizzo spoke to Mokbel (it was one of 14 calls police recorded between the two), who was hiding in Athens. The problem was that they couldn\u2019t withdraw the drugs as they needed the money. Around the same time, phone taps showed Rizzo was about to pick up cash hidden in a Collingwood storage depot. He was pulled over in Box Hill \u2013 in his car was $499,950 in cash wrapped in gift paper. A few days after police seized the money, the musician and Rizzo met in a Box Hill hotel room to package drugs for distribution. But the cook had gone bad, and so they contacted Mokbel for instructions. Mokbel ordered them to move the product quickly at a discount. The cook said he could do a better job by using a 20-litre reaction vessel. These bugged calls gave police the chance to introduce \u201cAndy\u201d.\n\nOver six days, \u201cAndy\u201d made three buys totalling 1.1 kilos of speed for $114,000. Police testing showed what Tony feared: it was complete crap. In a usual job, the undercover \u2013 to keep his credibility \u2013 would return the drugs and demand his money back, but this was not a usual job. Time was running out. Two detectives, one from Purana and the second from the federal police, were flying to Athens to find and arrest Mokbel. Not that Tony knew that, although he was starting to smell a rat. Mokbel asked his Melbourne executives: who was this \u201cAndy\u201d, and why should we trust him? What if he was an undercover cop? Mokbel wanted \u201cAndy\u201d followed, and then had a second plan: get him naked.\n\nYou need \u201cAndy\u201d to get his kit off, to check he wasn\u2019t wearing a recording device. And, as a matter of trust, Rizzo needed to strip off to show, he too, was not recording. While Rizzo was relaxed about drug matters, male nudity was something else. Unlike the mobsters in movies, he was not a steam room sort of guy. At the Box Hill restaurant, Rizzo was sweating and anxious. He then asked \u201cAndy\u201d to adjourn to the uncomfortably small restroom. Rizzo went in first, turned around, and without a word, unbuttoned his shirt and dropped his trousers. This would have surprised \u201cAndy\u201d if he had not been forewarned from the phone taps. After pausing to let Rizzo sweat a little more, \u201cAndy\u201d removed his shirt and dropped his trousers. He then spun around and bent over to show there was no tiny listening device where the sun doesn\u2019t shine.\n\nHaving followed his boss\u2019s orders, Rizzo quickly dressed and returned to the table (washing his hands first). Later in a conversation recorded in \u201cAndy\u2019s\u201d car while they were doing a drug deal, Rizzo bragged about his romantic encounters with the opposite sex, as if to assure his newfound friend that a naked encounter in a toilet with another man was strictly business. Within days, the trap was set. On June 5, 2007, Mokbel was arrested in a restaurant in Athens (carrying 3030\u2019s doctored passport). As soon as the arrest was confirmed, police raided 22 properties in Melbourne, seizing drugs, guns, $790,000 in cash, rubber gloves, chemical equipment and an orange A4 exercise book that contained drug recipes. Tony Mokbel is escorted by plain clothes police officers after appearing before a public prosecutor at Athens Appeals Court building in June 2007. Credit: AP At Rizzo\u2019s house, police found details of $400,000 in transfers to Mokbel in Greece, plus the golden thread: a spreadsheet documenting incomings and outgoings, and a list of drug quantities from July 2006 to June 2007. Court records show: \u201cThe document establishes that this group has been responsible for the production of approximately 42 kilos of amphetamine since July 2006, which generated an income for the group of approximately $4.2 million.\u201d\n\nIn sentencing Rizzo to a minimum of 13 years, King said: \u201cYou with other members of the company monitored the quality of those drugs; stored the drugs until sold; cut and repackaged the drugs; marketed the drugs; and, through you, kept a book of account on The Company\u2019s customers and monies flowing in and out.\u201d In sentencing Mokbel over Operation Magnum, Justice Simon Whelan made it clear Rizzo\u2019s accounting records and the phone taps were unshakeable evidence. \u201cThe telephone intercepts reveal two noteworthy matters in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, you conducted yourself as a manager. You delegated. You gave advice. You encouraged co-operation. You sought to maintain morale. \u201cI have given very serious consideration to imposing a life sentence on the Magnum offence. Your commission of that offence revealed, in my view, arrogant contempt for the law, and an incorrigible determination to persist in serious, business-like drug trafficking regardless of the circumstances or possible consequence.\u201d Mokbel was sentenced to 20 years for Magnum.",

Ed Sloane Previous Slide Next Slide Good Food hat Good Food hat 17 / 20 How we score Contemporary$$$$ If every neighbourhood needs a good baker, butcher and cafe, perhaps it also needs a perfect little fine-dining restaurant. Seven years in, Navi is just that. Since 2018, chef Julian Hills has taken diners on culinary adventures in a 30-seat dining room in a quiet inner-west pocket. The room \u2013 now with adjoining lounge bar \u2013 feels like a gallery, sparse and sleek, ready to showcase beauty and provoke amazement and delight over eight or so small courses. There\u2019s a trend in contemporary dining towards simplicity, so let\u2019s ask a tricky question: is there a point to expensive restaurants with complex food, hefty wine lists and waiters that can tell you which side of the hill the grapes grew on?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all very well for a chef to work out that pickled magnolia flowers and raw fish taste nice together, but is there a pay-off for diners? Well, yes, when it\u2019s as fun and surprising as Navi. Of course, a meal like this is an investment \u2013 but so is a ticket to the grand final. Navi is a restaurant that might make a jaded diner fall back in love with tasting menus, and it\u2019s a welcoming entryway for people who\u2019ve never eaten like this. Murray cod with fermented potato. Bonnie Savage A tasting menu (with, potentially, matched drinks, too) makes frequent interaction with waiters inevitable, but the polished, perceptive team here dances a delicate line between informing and interrupting. If you\u2019re geeking out about the non-alcoholic beetroot \u201cwine\u201d with carrot and betel leaf, they\u2019ll hang about to discuss it. If you\u2019re screwing up the courage to propose to your one and only, they\u2019ll just melt away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA meal like this is an investment \u2013 but so is a ticket to the grand final. Last time I visited, Hills was on a rare trip overseas. That might seem like a bad thing. Actually, it was an opportunity to witness the playful spirit he\u2019s shared with his crew. Whether Hills is here or not, this is his singular vision. A creative guy who was studying ceramics when he fell into cooking at the Myer cafeteria in the 1990s, Hills realised he had a knack for flavour matches when the blue-rinse set started lining up for his roasts. \u201cMy brain is very busy,\u201d the self-taught chef tells me later. \u201cI can taste everything in my head before I put it on a plate.\u201d He\u2019s inspired by what\u2019s growing \u2013 either in his own patch, on the farms of trusted suppliers or in secret foraging spots \u2013 and by the house-made preserves burbling away out the back. \u201cElements of Aylesbury duck\u201d is a signature medley, although the preparations change. Bonnie Savage\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe arrival snack is a black garlic macaron filled with salmon caviar, the only dish always on the menu and a pointer to the so-crazy-it-works approach. That might be followed by a tiny sourdough tart filled with sea urchin and gleaming apple-and-yuzu jelly. There\u2019ll be a vegetable investigation: I had golden beetroot variously dried, fermented, pickled and roasted, a chewy, crunchy, earthy assembly that\u2019s a rollercoaster for the taste buds. There\u2019s always adroitly cooked duck breast served with other cleverly prepared parts \u2013 perhaps koji-brined duck heart, melting pancetta or kofte with liver, a signature medley expressing both consistency and perpetual curiosity, which resolves in pure enjoyment. Finger lime ice-cream with black sesame meringue. Bonnie Savage Dessert is based around a fermented finger lime ice-cream, sour and caramelised, briskly whipping around the palate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Navi launched in 2018, the feeling was \u201cWelcome to my home\u201d. The warmth persists as the restaurant has grown into itself: more structure and breadth has allowed greater ambition, assuring this neighbourhood gem is among Victoria\u2019s finest places to dine.

    "text": "Meanwhile, the Raiders suffered a crushing defeat to the Broncos on Sunday afternoon in a 94-minute, 29-28 golden point thriller after an inspired performance from Reece Walsh helped Brisbane come back from two sin-bins and a 16-point deficit to claim victory. How does the NRL final series work Who\u2019s playing who in week two? Brisbane and Melbourne have a week to put their feet up after winning their qualifying finals in week one.\n\nFor the remaining four teams \u2013 Sharks, Raiders, Panthers and Bulldogs \u2013 it\u2019s time to do battle. First up, it\u2019s the Raiders hosting the Sharks at 7.50pm on Saturday at GIO Stadium in Canberra in a must-win elimination semi-final. The winner will head to AAMI Park in Melbourne next week to play the Storm at 7.50pm, while the loser will just have to try their luck next year. Then, on Sunday at 4.05pm, it\u2019s Penrith against the Bulldogs at Accor Stadium, in an elimination match that is expected to draw a crowd upwards of 70,000. Penrith are hunting their fifth consecutive premiership. If they manage to do it, they\u2019ll be the first in NRL history to win a grand-final from outside the top four.\n\nThe winner of that match has the tough task of heading to Brisbane the next week to face the Broncos at Suncorp Stadium at 4.05pm in the preliminary final.

The Roosters \u2013 who were undefeated this season \u2013 and the Broncos \u2013 whose only loss of the year was to the Roosters \u2013 have the week off after finishing one and two on the NRLW ladder. This week the Knights host the Titans in the first of the NRLW elimination finals, before the Cowboys face the Sharks in Townsville. This is the first year the Cowboys have played in the finals since they entered the NRLW in 2023.\n\nThe winner of the game in Newcastle will play the Broncos in the preliminary finals in Brisbane, while the winner of Townsville\u2019s game will face the Roosters in Sydney. What date is the NRL grand final 2025? The NRL grand final will be held on Sunday, October 5, at Accor Stadium in Sydney. Public transport is free with any game ticket and additional trains and buses will be operating to get fans out to Olympic Park. A flat rate fee of $35 applies to all parking but must be pre-booked on the Sydney Olympic Park website.\n\nWhat time is the NRL grand final 2025 kick-off? Gates will open from 1pm with the state championship kicking off at 1.20pm, followed by the NRLW grand final kicking off at 3:55pm. The pre-game entertainment for the NRL grand final starts at 6.30pm and kick off is slated for 7.30pm with full-time expected to come to 9.20pm. Who are the favourites? Bookmakers have the Melbourne Storm as favourites for the 2025 premiership, with Sportsbet paying $3.10 for them to lift the trophy.\n\nUnfortunately for the Bulldogs, they\u2019re the least likely to win the title according to the bookies who are paying $23 for the Belmore club to claim the title. Meanwhile, it\u2019s the Storm and Broncos who are the frontrunners to make the grand final, ahead of Penrith, Canberra, Cronulla and Canterbury. Who is Teddy Swims, the grand final entertainment? While the AFL has locked in Snoop Dogg for their grand final this month, Grammy nominated singer-songwriter Teddy Swims is travelling from the US to perform at the NRL grand final. Swims was nominated for Best New Artist at this year\u2019s Grammy Awards and his most popular song, Lose Control, has two billion streams on Spotify.\n\nLoading How to watch the NRL grand final 2025?

    "text": "United States President Donald Trump has celebrated the suspension of talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel from the airwaves and said TV broadcasters should lose their licences over negative coverage of his administration, adding fuel to a debate over free speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, US broadcaster ABC announced it was pulling the late-night comedy show Jimmy Kimmel Live \"indefinitely\" following Kimmel's comments after the killing of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his trip to the United Kingdom, Trump said Kimmel had been punished for saying \"a horrible thing\" about Kirk.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to the US, Trump complained about receiving bad publicity from broadcasters, saying: \"That's something that should be talked about for licensing... All they do is hit Trump.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would think maybe their license should be taken away,\" Trump said. \"It will be up to [Federal Communications Commission chief] Brendan Carr.\"\n\n\n\nUS federal law prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from revoking a broadcaster's licence for negative coverage or other speech disliked by the government.\n\n\n\nNot 'the last shoe to drop', says US federal broadcasting chief\n\nBrendan Carr, the head of the FCC, which regulates broadcasters, said Kimmel's axing was part of a \"massive shift\" taking place in US media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think this is the last shoe to drop. This is a massive shift that's taking place in the media ecosystem. The consequences will continue to flow,\" Carr said in an interview with Fox News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe praised the owners of local TV stations that broadcast ABC programming for putting the network's owner, Disney, under pressure to take Kimmel off the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're going to go back to that era when local TV stations, judging the public interest, get to decide what the American people think,\" Carr said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The key point is these were local TV stations, licensed by the FCC, that have a public interest obligation to serve their local community; they pushed back on Disney.\"\n\n\n\nCarr said the federal regulator would be \"constraining the power\" of large media networks, singling out Disney and Comcast. But in reality, the FCC does not regulate programming on national networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox \u2014 its authority lies in issuing licences to local broadcast affiliates that use the public airwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nComcast, which owns NBC, hosts other late-night programs, including The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers, both of whom Trump called \"total losers\" in a Truth Social post, calling for their cancellation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"\n\n\n\nTrump administration 'silencing its critics'\n\nWalt Disney-owned ABC said it was pulling the show after Kimmel's comments that conservatives were using Kirk's killing to score political points.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama urged media companies not to capitulate to government coercion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like,\" Obama said in a statement.\n\n\n\nWriters' and actors' labour unions called the targeting of Kimmel an unconstitutional attack on the right to disagree. The American Civil Liberties Union called it an unconstitutional attempt by the Trump administration to \"silence its critics and control what the American people watch and read\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe longest-serving talk show host in the US, David Letterman, also condemned Kimmel's suspension and said ABC was \"trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration\".\n\n\n\n\n\nKimmel is set to meet with Walt Disney executives to discuss the show's future, according to Bloomberg News. The parties will discuss whether there is a way to return \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" to the air, the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Reuters\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a reunion lunch in Sydney, pioneer volunteers of the city's 2000 Olympics are taking a trip down memory lane.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been more than 25 years since they took part in the games.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for them, the friendships they forged are ever-present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we had going was too good to let go of.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, yes. And we formed friendships. We didn't know each other before 1992, but because of the games we formed these friendships.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was amazing. You could speak to anybody.\"\n\n\n\n\"Everyone was happy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, weren't they?\"\n\n\n\n\"Whether you were on the train or the bus or walking the streets. Yeah, it was fantastic.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was very special.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 47,000 people ((46,967)) volunteered throughout the games, according to the Australian Olympic Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pioneer volunteers gave their time - not only during, but also in the lead up to the Olympics - some as early as 1992 ahead of Sydney's bid for the games.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the group tries to meet every four months, for some this could be their last milestone reunion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Realistically, this is the last. Because when we get to 2030, the next milestone, everybody will be looking to Brisbane 2032. Sydney will be past history.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Rosemary Mula, a so-called, 'super-volunteer' who has been involved in multiple Olympic games.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow in her 80s ((84)) she dreamed of competing in the Olympics since she was a child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I say to kids in schools, I wasn't an Olympian. But I've had an Olympic journey.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1956, she reluctantly moved to Australia at age 15, trading countryside England for Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In those days it was a ship journey, six weeks, and you were never going to go home again. So, it was a major decision. And as a young teenager for me it was traumatic, because I was leaving my family, my school, my friends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA chance encounter at the city's 1956 games inspired her own Olympic journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And my father was a foundry worker. I don't know how he got me a ticket, but he did and I was at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was the Olympic Stadium, and it was the day of the triple jump final.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith no Brits or Australians in the final, she cheered for the defending champion, Brazilian athlete Adhemar Ferreira da Silva, who ended up winning despite being considered too old to claim another gold medal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's before the days when athletes were psychologically focused and all the modern techniques that are used... And he ran around and said, 'You kids helped to win this medal.' And that was me hooked for life. I wanted to be an Olympian, I wanted to march in an Opening Ceremony.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in university, Rosemary realised she wouldn't make it as an Olympic hurdler.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, she became a teacher and later volunteered in the Sydney games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I lost some of my enthusiasm and then my appendix blew up. So I got out of training, then discovered boys and got a job and so forth, so. But my passion for the Olympic games never died. It was always there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYears later she recognised Da Silva in Singapore, telling him she witnessed him win the gold medal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was so excited because again it was pre-television, pre-recording, and he said, 'You're the only person in my life that saw me win that medal.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey kept in contact, with Da Silva later staying with her family during the Sydney games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I said to him, 'Adhemar, I was never an Olympian but I've had seven years of the most amazing Olympic journey as a volunteer, but my journey is over.' And he took my face in his hands and he said, 'Rosemary, your Olympic journey is not over. You must find a way.'\n\n\n\n\n\nRosemary went on to march in an Olympic Opening ceremony with Kiribati as their team attach\u00e9 and has since volunteered all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't let any adult - teacher, parent, family, friend - tell you you can't do something. If you want to write music, or write stories or be an actor or an athlete, you can. But it won't happen if you sit on your bottom. You have to get up and do something to make it happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack at the reunion lunch, pioneer volunteers mull over whether they'll help out with the Brisbane 2032 Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We'll see. I asked a friend of mine who is much younger and I said, 'Should we do Brisbane?' And he said, 'I'll look for accommodation.' And I said, 'Make sure it's wheelchair accessible.' (Laughs).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd from Rosemary Mula, this message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had such an amazing reputation for being outstanding volunteers and other countries that have hosted the games use us as a benchmark.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A \"Goldilocks scenario\" has the Australian dollar on somewhat of a winning streak, experts say, particularly against the United States dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has reached a 10-month high against the US dollar this week, breaking 67 US cents for the first time since November 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt slipped slightly following the United States Federal Reserve's rate cut announcement and the release of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' jobs data, which suggested the labour market could be cooling.\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Weston, the head of research at foreign exchange trader Pepperstone, told the SBS News' On the Money podcast this week that the Australian dollar was \"looking quite good on a relative basis\", particularly against the US dollar and New Zealand dollar\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Aussie dollar has been performing very well on a broad basis as well,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Australian dollar hits a 10 month high against the US SBS News 14:14 English\n\n\"And I think if you look at relative interest rates, relative growth, with a fairly low deficit compared to other countries, we're looking like a beacon of stability relatively speaking,\" Weston said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrices for iron ore \u2014 Australia's most valuable exports \u2014 have been solid, he said, and \"absolutely ripping\" share markets in China \u2014 Australia's largest trading partner \u2014 had in part helped create a \"Goldilocks scenario for Australian dollar outperformance\".\n\n\n\nGrowth doesn't tell the whole story\n\nBecause the Aussie dollar is a speculative currency, it's difficult to pinpoint where it should be valued or how it will grow in the future. But even then, experts say the perceived growth of the dollar isn't so much a success story for Australia, but more a reaction to the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrendan Rynne, chief economist for KPMG Australia, said the growth had more to do with the valuation of the US dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's got more to do with the fact that the US dollar is depreciating against most of the other currencies around the world than necessarily anything that's reflecting too positively on the Australian dollar,\" Rynne said.\n\n\n\nWeston said the US dollar may be weakening due to concerns over whether the Federal Reserve could be \"behind the curve\" on interest rate cuts \u2014 having started later than others, including the Reserve Bank of Australia, weakening jobs data, and stagnant real wage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also said the impact of US President Donald Trump trying to \"influence\" the Federal Reserve carries a \"slightly higher premium for the US dollar\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US dollar has been falling since Trump took office for the second time, dropping by over 10 per cent in the first half of 2025 \u2014 its worst first-half performance in more than 50 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the euro has rallied by more than 13 per cent against the greenback this year.\n\n\n\nHow will this affect consumers?\n\nIf you're planning on travelling overseas anytime soon, you might benefit from that value jump \u2014 or lose out \u2014 depending on where you're flying to. Because while the Australian dollar has appreciated against the US dollar, it has depreciated \"quite substantially\" against the pound and euro, Rynne said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA year ago, the Australian dollar was buying around 52 British pence and 60 euro cents. Now, it's about 49 British pence and 56 euro cents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you want to travel to the United States, your Australian dollars are going to buy you more than they would 12 months ago,\" Rynne said. \"Having a nice holiday in the US will cost you a little bit less.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, on the other side of the coin, travelling in Europe will be more expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dollar shift will also affect the cost to buy things from each country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you were looking to buy something from the UK at the moment, it would be much more expensive than what it was 18 months ago. It's the same with Europe,\" Rynne said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means it will be more expensive for US companies to buy Australian goods and services, but more affordable for companies in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Rynne said the Aussie dollar is in a \"relatively good spot\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got inflation under control, we've got a stable political environment, we've got an independent central bank, we have a recognition that rates are still likely to come down from where they are at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All of those paint a strong picture in relation to the underlying value of the Australian dollar relative to other currencies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWeston said he didn't anticipate a \"ripping trend\" would take the Australian dollar above 70 US cents \u2014 a feat last seen in 2022 \u2014 \"anytime soon\". But it could be a possibility if the US economy worsened but share markets held up, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice; you should consult with a licensed professional to make the decisions that are right for you.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "United States President Donald Trump and United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the renewal of their nations' \"special relationship\", drawing Trump's unprecedented second state visit to a close with a show of unity after avoiding possible pitfalls.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a warm press conference when the two leaders glossed over differences on Gaza and wind power to present a united front, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had \"let him down\" and he was disappointed other countries were still buying Russian oil because only a low oil price would punish Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter two days of his state visit to Britain, which the US leader described as an \"exquisite honour\", Trump was in a relaxed mode at the final press conference while Starmer was focused on avoiding areas of disagreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither leader was tripped up by potentially embarrassing subjects, with both batting away questions over the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his ties to Trump and to Starmer's former ambassador to the US.\n\n\n\n'Special relationship' renewed\n\n\"We've renewed the special relationship for a new era,\" Starmer told reporters.\n\n\n\n\"This partnership today is a signal of our determination to win this race together and to ensure it brings real benefits in jobs, in growth, in lower bills, to put more hard-earned cash in people's pockets at the end of each month,\" Starmer said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump also paid homage to the close ties between the two countries, saying Starmer was a tough negotiator in securing the first tariff deal with the US, although Britain has still not secured the lower US tariffs on steel that it was seeking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're forever joined, and we are forever friends and we will always be friends,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, at the start of a business reception, some of the leading names in US and UK business were welcomed by the two leaders to unveil a record \u00a3150 billion ($307 billion) package of US investment into Britain from giants such as Microsoft and Blackstone, part of a wider package officials say will benefit both sides.\n\n\n\n'Priceless ties'\n\nStarmer said the deals would \"light up the special relationship for years to come\". Trump was equally effusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ties between our countries are priceless,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe first day of Donald Trump's state visit to the UK concluded with a banquet at Windsor Castle. Source: AAP / Phil Noble \"We've done some things that financially are great for both countries ... I think it's an unbreakable bond we have, regardless of what we're doing today. I think it's unbreakable,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer has pitched Britain as a destination for US investment, aligning it with the country's financial services, tech, and energy sectors, so it can attract US capital and expand its infrastructure to drive economic growth.\n\n\n\nJimmy Kimmel and free speech\n\nTrump was also asked about the decision by US broadcaster ABC to take late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off air indefinitely , after comments he made during his show about reactions by Trump and other Republicans to the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk,\" Trump said during the press conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person. He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago. So, you know, you can call that free speech or not. He was fired for lack of talent.\"\n\n\n\nStarmer avoided a blowup on differing UK and US interpretations of free speech, after Trump said the UK had \"laid the foundations of law, liberty, free speech and individual rights\" under its empire and \"must continue to stand for the values ... of the English-speaking world\".\n\n\n\nDisagreements on foreign policy\n\nIt was on foreign affairs where the two were most out of lockstep.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer and other European leaders have been pressing Trump to put more pressure on Putin to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, while criticising Putin, failed to mention any further sanctions against Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US leader again expressed frustration that European nations were still buying Russian oil, but said Starmer was not part of their number.\n\n\n\nProtesters marched through central London to oppose the presence and policies of Donald Trump during his state visit to the UK. Source: Getty / Guy Smallman Trump also repeated his position that he disagreed with countries recognising Palestinian statehood \u2014 something Starmer has said Britain will do if Israel fails to relieve suffering in Gaza and reach a ceasefire in its war with Hamas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score, one of our few disagreements, actually,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nLeaders sidestep questions on Epstein\n\nBut the two leaders sidestepped questions on Epstein, after both were asked about Starmer's decisions to sack Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the US last week after his close ties with the late financier were revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's relationship with Epstein has also come under scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know him, actually,\" Trump said in response to a question about Mandelson. \"I think the prime minister would be better speaking over that; it was a choice that he made.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer repeated his position: \"Some information came to light last week which wasn't available when he was appointed and I made a decision about it, and that's very clear.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the final question was answered, a clearly relieved Starmer ushered Trump out of the Great Hall at Chequers \u2014 the country residence of UK Prime Ministers \u2014 before Trump left to return to Washington.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "An \"out-of-date\" superannuation rule could cost Australia\u2019s low-income workers $500 million in savings this year, according to a superannuants' advocacy group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Super Members Council (SMC) has called for a lift of the Low-Income Superannuation Tax Offset (LISTO), a rebate introduced to help low-income earners boost their nest egg.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rebate has been frozen for 13 years causing millions of workers to miss out on savings, according to the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigned to make Australia\u2019s tax system fairer, the LISTO gives low-income earners a tax refund for their superannuation contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in 2020, tax brackets changed while the offset remained the same, leaving thousands of low-income earners out of its scope.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Calls for change to Low Income Super Tax Offset rule SBS News 01:04 English\n\nIt means some 1.2 million low-income workers will miss out on a collective $500 million dollars this financial year, with women and young people more likely to be affected, according to the report. It also found the problem is set to become more \"acute\" when stage three tax cuts come into effect in 2027.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Low-Income Superannuation Tax Offset?\n\nSuperannuation is taxed for most Australians at a flat rate of 15 per cent. The LISTO is a fairness measure implemented to ensure low-income earners don\u2019t end up paying more tax on their superannuation than on their take-home pay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LISTO offers refunds up to $500 that are directly deposited into superannuation accounts by the Australian Taxation Office.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the LISTO was introduced in 2012 it applied for those earning up to $37,000, covering the two lowest-earning brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the LISTO is not indexed, and has remained the same for 13 years, in spite of inflation and changes made to Australia\u2019s income brackets.\n\n\n\nIn July 2020 the second income bracket was raised from $37,000 to $45,000, rendering roughly 500,000 low-income earners ineligible for the LISTO. Analysis from the SMC report estimated this cohort has lost a collective $3 billion in rebates.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its report, the SMC has said millions of Australians were no longer receiving the tax benefit they deserved, a situation anticipated to worsen amid further changes to income brackets in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SMC's modelling suggests that, if the LISTO remains frozen, one in four people will pay a higher tax rate on their superannuation contributions than on their income.\n\n\n\nWho else is affected?\n\nPeople working in low-paid, frontline professions are most vulnerable to missing out on benefits from the LISTO, with women and young people most at risk, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe occupations where workers were anticipated to be most-affected included carers and aides, followed by salespeople and health professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Members Council acting CEO Georgia Brumby said it was \"time to fix\" the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One part of our super system has been frozen for 13 years, and more than a million low-paid workers, the majority of which are women, are being shortchanged by up to $60,000 in retirement savings. It\u2019s time to fix it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians put aside a portion of their money for their future \u2013 in exchange the government gives them a tax benefit. We must keep that promise by ensuring the system is fair and continues to deliver for all Australians,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How much super do Australians need to retire? It could be less than you think\n\nThe SMC has called for eligibility for the LISTO to be bumped up to $45,000, ensuring earners in the lowest-two income brackets receive a benefit for their superannuation contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council also recommended the LISTO payment be increased from $500 to $810, echoing calls from the Grattan Institute and Women in Super.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has finally announced it's long awaited 2035 emissions reduction target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today I announce that we have accepted their advice (from the Climate Change Authority) that Australia's 2035 emissions reduction target be 62 to 70 per cent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the month, the Climate Change Authority recommended the government set a target of between 65 and 75 per cent - compared to 2005 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing just how much Australia is willing to contribute to global emissions reductions, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he has considered the advice of experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our plan for the next 10 years builds on the foundations that we have laid over the last three. Overwhelmingly, the three areas where we need to reduce most of our emissions come from electricity, transport and industry. On electricity, we will continue to support clean energy with renewables - backed by gas and battery storage. In 2022, we inherited a national energy grid that had been run into the ground.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental groups are calling the target too low.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, some industry and business groups are saying it's too high.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut first, what exactly is the emissions reduction target?\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeritus Professor Mark Howden has worked for 36 years on climate change policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat has included contributions to the UN's expert panel on climate change, the I-P-C-C; and ten years as founding director at the Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions at The Australian National University.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explains what this new target means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So an emission reduction goal is a comparison of our emissions in the future with those back in 2005. And it matters because under the Paris Agreement that we've signed, we committed to keeping temperatures down below two degrees. And if possible, close to one-and-a half degrees above pre-industrial (emission levels). And the only way we can do that is by really ambitious emission reductions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far - the federal government says emissions have been reduced by 29 per cent from 2005 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it aims for a 2050 target of net zero emissions, Australia's interim targets are: a 43 per cent cut by 2030 and a 62 to 70 per cent cut by 2035.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Paris Agreement, adopted by Australia and 195 others in 2015, aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees - and at the most, below 2 degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a signatory, Australia is obligated to increase reduction targets every five years; and is not allowed to weaken them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling the target weak, Greens leader Larissa Waters says this target is dangerously low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look, a range of 62 per cent to 70 per cent means 62 per cent. The only reason they've put a range in place is so that they can hit the lowest end of the range and then claim to be heroes. Well, this target is so appallingly low, it will not keep us safe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has also released what they've called the Net Zero Plan, outlining the steps to achieve the new target.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commitments include: $2 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a $5 billion net zero fund within the national reconstruction fund, and $1.1 billion for the production of clean fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen says these are just a few of the steps they'll be taking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So all these investments are important, as well as new investments in energy performance and energy efficiency. We'll create, for the first time, a statement of demand opportunities. We have an energy statement of opportunities, a gas statement of opportunities. We'll ask AEMO [Australian Energy Market Operator] to prepare a demand statement of opportunities. And we'll expand NatHERS and NABERS (energy rating systems). The tools which enable households and businesses to test the energy efficiency of their premises and make sure they are getting value for money and are driving energy efficiency as much as possible. All this together amounts to a serious, credible, robust plan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Larissa Waters says the allocated funding is nowhere near what's needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look the Net Zero plan, and the dollars associated with it, are less than this government gives to coal and gas companies every single year in fossil fuel subsidies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition meanwhile remains deeply divided over their climate policy, with frontbencher Andrew Hastie threatening to quit if a net zero emissions policy is not dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley says she is evaluating the target on the metrics of cost and credibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It fails on both counts. It can't be believed because the government assumes that the 2030 target is in fact met. When clearly it will not be. The credibility is in tatters. In addition to that, there is nothing in this announcement that demonstrates to Australians how much it will cost. And that's not reasonable for households, for businesses, for the hardworking manufacturers in this country who want answers and are seeing their electricity bills skyrocket.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDays before the announcement, Australia's first climate risk assessment was released.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Climate Risk Assessment revealed 63 nationally significant climate risks, including rising sea levels and heatwaves, impacting 1.5 million Australians by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt lays out a catastrophic vision for the future, if serious action is not taken to address climate change in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile critics of stronger climate action flag cost concerns, Professor Howden says the cost of inaction is far greater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, I think what the risk assessment showed is that climate change is a real problem for Australia. The cost will be born right across sectors pretty much by every Australian, and whether it's through insurance or through direct impacts of climate change or through increased payments because of disaster risk payments that may increase by up to seven times. So climate change is going to cost Australia dearly. And when we look at the economics, reducing our emissions is far cheaper if we do it sensibly than putting up with climate change. And so economically, the best thing we can do is actually reduce our emissions and encourage other countries to take their own emission reduction activity proportionately.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says claims that renewables are pushing up energy prices, are not based in reality.\n\n\n\n",

The credibility is in tatters,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In addition to that, there is nothing in this announcement that demonstrates to Australians how much it will cost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will hold them to account because we know this is grounded in fantasy land. Targets must be achievable and realistic.

This remains the only course that can avert the accelerating impacts of a world warmed beyond 1.5C,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A 62 per cent to 70 per cent range is a step forward, but it sends a signal that we are comfortable with the status quo.

Today, we announce a net zero $5 billion reconstruction fund to help large industry decarbonise and scale up more renewables and low emissions manufacturing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Paris Climate Accord, the government must submit its new climate target by the end of the month.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agreement, which 195 parties including Australia signed in 2015, aims to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and less than 2.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens were quick to respond to the government's newly announced 2035 net zero target, with party Larissa Waters labelling the emissions target range an utter failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Waters criticised the government for releasing the target shortly after approving the Woodside Northwest Shelf Gas Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A range of 62 per cent to 70 per cent means 62 per cent. The only reason they've put a range in place is so that they can hit the lowest end of the range and then claim to be heroes. Well, this target is so appallingly low, it will not keep us safe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's announcement also follows the recent release of the first National Climate Risk Assessment, which laid out a catastrophic vision of Australia's future if the Paris Agreement targets are not met.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says the 2050 target announced by the government is ambitious and will be challenging to achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief executive Andrew McKellar urged politicians to take a bipartisan approach to support policy certainty for businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will be very challenging for business and for industry to get to this target. But the important thing is business needs certainty if we're able to put in place the investment that is required to continue on the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nOutspoken former radio host and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has pleaded not guilty to dozens of sexual abuse charges in a Sydney court today.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same hearing, several charges against him were withdrawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Jones' lawyer Bryan Wrench told the court the changes removed any allegations of aggravated conduct, or accusations that any of the alleged victims were under Jones' authority at the time of the alleged abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 84-year-old had been accused of historical sex offences against 11 people - the youngest of whom was 17 at the time - over two decades when he dominated Sydney's airwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Jones now faces 25 charges of indecent assault and two of sexual touching against nine alleged victims, and will face a local court hearing in 2026, with the date due to be set in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors did not explain in court why the charges related to two victims are no longer being pursued.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if this story has caused distress for you or someone you know, 24-hour support is available at 1800 RESPECT 1800 737 732.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taliban says it has cut internet connections in five provinces in the north of Afghanistan to prevent what it calls immoral activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials say the outage affects all internet connections via fibre optic cable, but internet access on mobile phone data is still available.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move has prompted fears the regime will enforce the ban across the country, as it cites concern over pornography and online flirting.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhalid Amiri is an Afghan journalist who was evacuated after the Taliban came to power in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS Pashto, the ban further isolates Afghans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It particularly affects the Afghan diaspora in countries like Australia and across the West, where families remain separated since the Taliban takeover.

I certainly will be putting the test of cost and credibility against whatever is announced- and it may well be today, Because these are massive failings of the government. We've got a trifecta of energy failures actually staring them in the face- with costs up, with emissions flatlining, with reliability down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Ley is refusing to give any more insight as to when the coalition will come up with its own policy in this area, as internal debate continues within the opposition over whether it should support net-zero emissions.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe British government has used a state dinner for US President Donald Trump at Windsor Castle to remind his government about the important of the AUKUS agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is expected to raise the agreement if he meets Mr Trump next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agreement will see Australia spend 386 billion dollars to buy submarines from the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump's government is reviewing the submarine partnership to ensure it is in line with his America-First agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his speech at the state dinner, King Charles has ranked AUKUS alongside efforts to support Ukraine as a top-ranking defence and international security matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our countries have the closest defence, security and intelligence relationship ever known. In two World Wars, we fought together to defeat the forces of tyranny. Today, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine, to deter aggression and secure peace. And our AUKUS submarine partnership, with Australia, sets the benchmark for innovative and vital collaboration.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, a late goal from a Socceroo has handed Australian coach Ange Postecoglou his second loss in two games since taking over at English Premier League club Nottingham Forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian defender Cameron Burgess has scored two second half goals- the second of which came in the seventh minute of stoppage time- to help second-tier side Swansea City to a three goals to two win over Forest in the English League Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the European Champions League, Liverpool has been the beneficiary of a late goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefender Virgil van Dijk's goal in the second minute of second half stoppage time has given the English champions a three goals to two win over Atletico Madrid.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Liverpool coach Arne Slot, whose side led two goals to nil after just six minutes, says it shouldn't have come to that.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Ash Centra had no idea she\u2019d gone viral. The 19-year-old Collingwood rookie woke up the day after her debut game against Carlton at Ikon Park in August and redownloaded Instagram, an app she ritualistically deletes before games to block out external noise and clear her mind. Collingwood\u2019s Ash Centra Credit: Joe Armao Her inbox was jam-packed with an infinite number of hashtags, reels and messages from family, friends and complete strangers. Centra took a mark and booted her first major in the clash, but the most talked about moment was an innocuous move she made during a warm-up. While jogging, the rookie threaded the ball behind her back and bounced it between her legs \u2013 an impressive manoeuvre that would have impressed on a basketball court, but bamboozled with a Sherrin. \u201cI saw that people were tagging me in all these videos of the bounce, I was just like, this is ridiculous. Like, this cannot be happening,\u201d Centra told this masthead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin days, nearly everyone was attempting the bounce, including Hawthorn coach Sam Mitchell and Collingwood\u2019s Nick Daicos, Jack Crisp and Darcy Cameron. So where did the move come from? \u201cI think it\u2019s been something I\u2019ve aimed to master for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t really remember the exact moment when I started, but I think it\u2019s just a fun little thing to do during training or even during the warm-up. I think I was just lucky to be getting filmed whilst doing it, because it\u2019s definitely helped with all the hype.\u201d Like all No.1 draft picks, Centra entered the league with significant noise. A product of the AFLW\u2019s first national draft class, Centra was a star midfielder for Gippsland Power and was named the Coates Talent League\u2019s best and fairest in 2024. After her debut game, Collingwood coach Sam Wright quipped Centra had already developed a cult following, noting the gigantic cheer when she finally came off the bench to play. \u201cLooking back and reflecting, it was definitely probably the biggest highlight of my night, hearing that roar,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamily and friends from Centra\u2019s hometown Seaspray \u2013 a small coastal town in Gippsland \u2013 had made the three-hour trek to see her debut in Melbourne, including her twin brother Luca. Centra credits her brother for her love of footy. The twins grew up playing junior footy together and their competitive natures meant they pushed each other to be the best. Luca was in the stands cheering during Centra\u2019s debut, but accidentally missed a rather pivotal moment. \u201cDad came up to me after the game and said my brother was in the bathroom while I was having a set shot on goal, and unfortunately, he missed it, but my mum filmed it so he got to see afterwards,\u201d she laughed. Since that debut game, Centra has continued to impress, collecting a Rising Star nomination for her role in Collingwood\u2019s shock 26-point victory over the formerly undefeated Swans last week. Centra picked up a Rising Star nomination for her efforts in the round five clash with Sydney. Credit: Joe Armao Centra is full of praise for the team\u2019s new captain Ruby Schleicher, describing the dual All-Australian as the perfect leader who strikes the balance between having fun and being professional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI say this in a humble way, there\u2019s obviously a lot of attention on the first couple of picks in the draft, because you\u2019re expected to go out there and obviously try and change the game in some aspects,\u201d Centra said. \u201cRuby\u2019s been a massive mentor for me. She\u2019s guided me, and she\u2019s just super inclusive and super approachable when I need help, not only on the field but off the field as well.\u201d Last week Schleicher told this masthead rookies and top draft picks such as Centra were coming into AFLW with more pressure and noise than ever. \u201cSo within the four walls and as a leader, it\u2019s probably just my job to try and release that pressure and let them know that we don\u2019t need them to go out have 30 disposals and change the game,\u201d Schleicher said. \u201cWe just want to see them grow as players and enjoy their football.\u201d Centra models her game off Richmond best-and-fairest winner Monique Conti, adhering to a silky and versatile style of footy. However, the physical nature of AFLW has been a surprising adjustment. \u201cI came in on the first day of pre-season, and Britt Bonnici tackled me, and I was so taken back and shocked [by] how hard they hit,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading \u201cBut I think it really helps you understand where you\u2019re at and it helps you build that level of physicality. And I also think the speed of the game is so much different to what I\u2019m used to, but it\u2019s been a great challenge.\u201d Centra is also adjusting to the recent move to Melbourne and is currently living with family friends. The 19-year-old was born metres from the beach and misses swimming in the ocean, joking Melbourne\u2019s city beaches aren\u2019t quite the same. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot different to what I\u2019m used to. I know country life and city life are polar opposites ... so it\u2019s been an adjustment,\u201d she said \u201cIn Seaspray there\u2019s only like 300 residents, so everything\u2019s slow,\u201d she continued. \u201cNothing\u2019s really happening. We\u2019ve got one coffee shop, and then you come to Melbourne and there\u2019s like, 50 coffee shops metres from your house.\u201d Centra was looking forward to taking on Hawthorn at Victoria Park on Saturday in front of her family and friends, including her brother. \u201cHe\u2019s coming this weekend, so hopefully I\u2019ll kick him a goal that he\u2019ll see,\u201d she joked.",

    "text": "The AFP conviction was later quashed due to Nicola\u2019s nefarious needling. While the Commonwealth prosecutors felt they had enough for a retrial, they decided to let it go because he had done his time. Mokbel pleaded guilty to Quills, Orbital and Magnum. The remaining charges were dropped. For Tony, it was the best deal since Aldi sold snow ploughs for $99. It is entirely possible justices Stephen McLeish, Maree Kennedy and Stephen Kaye will decide that the Quills and Orbital convictions should be flushed down the toilet. Which brings us back to the toilet at the Box Hill restaurant and the naked face-off (although they weren\u2019t exactly facing off).\n\nThe chubby chap, built more like Billy Bunter than Billy the Kid, was Tony Mokbel\u2019s right-hand man, Bart Rizzo, and the second man was \u201cAndy Hossack\u201d, an undercover police officer. Artist sketch of Bart Rizzo in court. Rizzo was understandably self-conscious. Much later at his criminal court plea hearing, his lawyers would say he had battled weight problems since he was a child. Sad, but hardly mitigation as I have yet to see any criminological research linking the consumption of Mars bars with the production of methamphetamine. \u201cAndy\u201d had infiltrated the Mokbel syndicate, introduced by a trusted insider who was secretly working for the police. The insider, a musician, became Registered Human Source 3030. The musician was a great mate of Rizzo but a million-dollar reward on Tony\u2019s toupee-covered scalp persuaded him to work for the police.\n\n\u201cAndy\u2019s\u201d cover story was that he worked at a university and could steal large glass reactors that Mokbel\u2019s team needed to produce speed. It was late May 2007 when Andy first connected with the Mokbel syndicate, known as The Company. Rizzo was chief financial officer for The Company. He kept the books, chased the money and resolved the problems. His fellow executive was Joe Mansour, the operations manager. They had been firm friends since they were private school classmates. As Justice Betty King would later observe when sentencing Rizzo: \u201cYou and other company members ran \u2018The Company\u2019 as if it were a legitimate business.\u201d While Mokbel was a self-taught and quite brilliant businessman, Rizzo embarked on a Swinburne University business management course, dropping out in the final year \u2013 no doubt because there wasn\u2019t a unit on money laundering.\n\nRizzo provided a list of glassware and \u201cAndy\u201d produced two consignments for $7300 cash from the Mokbel coffers. Loading But \u201cAndy\u201d was not masquerading just as an opportunistic thief but also as a drug dealer looking for a product that Rizzo could provide. Trouble was, The Company had lost its two best speed cooks (three if you include Tony, who was pretty good on the tools). For years, Mokbel produced the best gear going about, but something had gone wrong. Customers were complaining about the smell of the latest batch, and some had been hospitalised.\n\nRizzo spoke to Mokbel (it was one of 14 calls police recorded between the two), who was hiding in Athens. The problem was that they couldn\u2019t withdraw the drugs as they needed the money. Around the same time, phone taps showed Rizzo was about to pick up cash hidden in a Collingwood storage depot. He was pulled over in Box Hill \u2013 in his car was $499,950 in cash wrapped in gift paper. A few days after police seized the money, the musician and Rizzo met in a Box Hill hotel room to package drugs for distribution. But the cook had gone bad, and so they contacted Mokbel for instructions. Mokbel ordered them to move the product quickly at a discount. The cook said he could do a better job by using a 20-litre reaction vessel. These bugged calls gave police the chance to introduce \u201cAndy\u201d.\n\nOver six days, \u201cAndy\u201d made three buys totalling 1.1 kilos of speed for $114,000. Police testing showed what Tony feared: it was complete crap. In a usual job, the undercover \u2013 to keep his credibility \u2013 would return the drugs and demand his money back, but this was not a usual job. Time was running out. Two detectives, one from Purana and the second from the federal police, were flying to Athens to find and arrest Mokbel. Not that Tony knew that, although he was starting to smell a rat. Mokbel asked his Melbourne executives: who was this \u201cAndy\u201d, and why should we trust him? What if he was an undercover cop? Mokbel wanted \u201cAndy\u201d followed, and then had a second plan: get him naked.\n\nYou need \u201cAndy\u201d to get his kit off, to check he wasn\u2019t wearing a recording device. And, as a matter of trust, Rizzo needed to strip off to show, he too, was not recording. While Rizzo was relaxed about drug matters, male nudity was something else. Unlike the mobsters in movies, he was not a steam room sort of guy. At the Box Hill restaurant, Rizzo was sweating and anxious. He then asked \u201cAndy\u201d to adjourn to the uncomfortably small restroom. Rizzo went in first, turned around, and without a word, unbuttoned his shirt and dropped his trousers. This would have surprised \u201cAndy\u201d if he had not been forewarned from the phone taps. After pausing to let Rizzo sweat a little more, \u201cAndy\u201d removed his shirt and dropped his trousers. He then spun around and bent over to show there was no tiny listening device where the sun doesn\u2019t shine.\n\nHaving followed his boss\u2019s orders, Rizzo quickly dressed and returned to the table (washing his hands first). Later in a conversation recorded in \u201cAndy\u2019s\u201d car while they were doing a drug deal, Rizzo bragged about his romantic encounters with the opposite sex, as if to assure his newfound friend that a naked encounter in a toilet with another man was strictly business. Within days, the trap was set. On June 5, 2007, Mokbel was arrested in a restaurant in Athens (carrying 3030\u2019s doctored passport). As soon as the arrest was confirmed, police raided 22 properties in Melbourne, seizing drugs, guns, $790,000 in cash, rubber gloves, chemical equipment and an orange A4 exercise book that contained drug recipes. Tony Mokbel is escorted by plain clothes police officers after appearing before a public prosecutor at Athens Appeals Court building in June 2007. Credit: AP At Rizzo\u2019s house, police found details of $400,000 in transfers to Mokbel in Greece, plus the golden thread: a spreadsheet documenting incomings and outgoings, and a list of drug quantities from July 2006 to June 2007. Court records show: \u201cThe document establishes that this group has been responsible for the production of approximately 42 kilos of amphetamine since July 2006, which generated an income for the group of approximately $4.2 million.\u201d\n\nIn sentencing Rizzo to a minimum of 13 years, King said: \u201cYou with other members of the company monitored the quality of those drugs; stored the drugs until sold; cut and repackaged the drugs; marketed the drugs; and, through you, kept a book of account on The Company\u2019s customers and monies flowing in and out.\u201d In sentencing Mokbel over Operation Magnum, Justice Simon Whelan made it clear Rizzo\u2019s accounting records and the phone taps were unshakeable evidence. \u201cThe telephone intercepts reveal two noteworthy matters in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, you conducted yourself as a manager. You delegated. You gave advice. You encouraged co-operation. You sought to maintain morale. \u201cI have given very serious consideration to imposing a life sentence on the Magnum offence. Your commission of that offence revealed, in my view, arrogant contempt for the law, and an incorrigible determination to persist in serious, business-like drug trafficking regardless of the circumstances or possible consequence.\u201d Mokbel was sentenced to 20 years for Magnum.",

Ed Sloane Previous Slide Next Slide Good Food hat Good Food hat 17 / 20 How we score Contemporary$$$$ If every neighbourhood needs a good baker, butcher and cafe, perhaps it also needs a perfect little fine-dining restaurant. Seven years in, Navi is just that. Since 2018, chef Julian Hills has taken diners on culinary adventures in a 30-seat dining room in a quiet inner-west pocket. The room \u2013 now with adjoining lounge bar \u2013 feels like a gallery, sparse and sleek, ready to showcase beauty and provoke amazement and delight over eight or so small courses. There\u2019s a trend in contemporary dining towards simplicity, so let\u2019s ask a tricky question: is there a point to expensive restaurants with complex food, hefty wine lists and waiters that can tell you which side of the hill the grapes grew on?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all very well for a chef to work out that pickled magnolia flowers and raw fish taste nice together, but is there a pay-off for diners? Well, yes, when it\u2019s as fun and surprising as Navi. Of course, a meal like this is an investment \u2013 but so is a ticket to the grand final. Navi is a restaurant that might make a jaded diner fall back in love with tasting menus, and it\u2019s a welcoming entryway for people who\u2019ve never eaten like this. Murray cod with fermented potato. Bonnie Savage A tasting menu (with, potentially, matched drinks, too) makes frequent interaction with waiters inevitable, but the polished, perceptive team here dances a delicate line between informing and interrupting. If you\u2019re geeking out about the non-alcoholic beetroot \u201cwine\u201d with carrot and betel leaf, they\u2019ll hang about to discuss it. If you\u2019re screwing up the courage to propose to your one and only, they\u2019ll just melt away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA meal like this is an investment \u2013 but so is a ticket to the grand final. Last time I visited, Hills was on a rare trip overseas. That might seem like a bad thing. Actually, it was an opportunity to witness the playful spirit he\u2019s shared with his crew. Whether Hills is here or not, this is his singular vision. A creative guy who was studying ceramics when he fell into cooking at the Myer cafeteria in the 1990s, Hills realised he had a knack for flavour matches when the blue-rinse set started lining up for his roasts. \u201cMy brain is very busy,\u201d the self-taught chef tells me later. \u201cI can taste everything in my head before I put it on a plate.\u201d He\u2019s inspired by what\u2019s growing \u2013 either in his own patch, on the farms of trusted suppliers or in secret foraging spots \u2013 and by the house-made preserves burbling away out the back. \u201cElements of Aylesbury duck\u201d is a signature medley, although the preparations change. Bonnie Savage\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe arrival snack is a black garlic macaron filled with salmon caviar, the only dish always on the menu and a pointer to the so-crazy-it-works approach. That might be followed by a tiny sourdough tart filled with sea urchin and gleaming apple-and-yuzu jelly. There\u2019ll be a vegetable investigation: I had golden beetroot variously dried, fermented, pickled and roasted, a chewy, crunchy, earthy assembly that\u2019s a rollercoaster for the taste buds. There\u2019s always adroitly cooked duck breast served with other cleverly prepared parts \u2013 perhaps koji-brined duck heart, melting pancetta or kofte with liver, a signature medley expressing both consistency and perpetual curiosity, which resolves in pure enjoyment. Finger lime ice-cream with black sesame meringue. Bonnie Savage Dessert is based around a fermented finger lime ice-cream, sour and caramelised, briskly whipping around the palate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Navi launched in 2018, the feeling was \u201cWelcome to my home\u201d. The warmth persists as the restaurant has grown into itself: more structure and breadth has allowed greater ambition, assuring this neighbourhood gem is among Victoria\u2019s finest places to dine.

    "text": "Meanwhile, the Raiders suffered a crushing defeat to the Broncos on Sunday afternoon in a 94-minute, 29-28 golden point thriller after an inspired performance from Reece Walsh helped Brisbane come back from two sin-bins and a 16-point deficit to claim victory. How does the NRL final series work Who\u2019s playing who in week two? Brisbane and Melbourne have a week to put their feet up after winning their qualifying finals in week one.\n\nFor the remaining four teams \u2013 Sharks, Raiders, Panthers and Bulldogs \u2013 it\u2019s time to do battle. First up, it\u2019s the Raiders hosting the Sharks at 7.50pm on Saturday at GIO Stadium in Canberra in a must-win elimination semi-final. The winner will head to AAMI Park in Melbourne next week to play the Storm at 7.50pm, while the loser will just have to try their luck next year. Then, on Sunday at 4.05pm, it\u2019s Penrith against the Bulldogs at Accor Stadium, in an elimination match that is expected to draw a crowd upwards of 70,000. Penrith are hunting their fifth consecutive premiership. If they manage to do it, they\u2019ll be the first in NRL history to win a grand-final from outside the top four.\n\nThe winner of that match has the tough task of heading to Brisbane the next week to face the Broncos at Suncorp Stadium at 4.05pm in the preliminary final. NRLW captains Georgia Hale, Tiana Penitani-Gray, Yasmin Clydsdale, Kirra Dibb, Ali Brigginshaw and Isabelle Kelly. Credit: Flavio Brancaleone Meanwhile, the NRLW is in its first week of finals. The Roosters \u2013 who were undefeated this season \u2013 and the Broncos \u2013 whose only loss of the year was to the Roosters \u2013 have the week off after finishing one and two on the NRLW ladder. This week the Knights host the Titans in the first of the NRLW elimination finals, before the Cowboys face the Sharks in Townsville. This is the first year the Cowboys have played in the finals since they entered the NRLW in 2023.\n\nThe winner of the game in Newcastle will play the Broncos in the preliminary finals in Brisbane, while the winner of Townsville\u2019s game will face the Roosters in Sydney. What date is the NRL grand final 2025? The NRL grand final will be held on Sunday, October 5, at Accor Stadium in Sydney. Public transport is free with any game ticket and additional trains and buses will be operating to get fans out to Olympic Park. A flat rate fee of $35 applies to all parking but must be pre-booked on the Sydney Olympic Park website.\n\nWhat time is the NRL grand final 2025 kick-off? Gates will open from 1pm with the state championship kicking off at 1.20pm, followed by the NRLW grand final kicking off at 3:55pm. The pre-game entertainment for the NRL grand final starts at 6.30pm and kick off is slated for 7.30pm with full-time expected to come to 9.20pm. Who are the favourites? Bookmakers have the Melbourne Storm as favourites for the 2025 premiership, with Sportsbet paying $3.10 for them to lift the trophy.\n\nUnfortunately for the Bulldogs, they\u2019re the least likely to win the title according to the bookies who are paying $23 for the Belmore club to claim the title. Meanwhile, it\u2019s the Storm and Broncos who are the frontrunners to make the grand final, ahead of Penrith, Canberra, Cronulla and Canterbury. Who is Teddy Swims, the grand final entertainment? While the AFL has locked in Snoop Dogg for their grand final this month, Grammy nominated singer-songwriter Teddy Swims is travelling from the US to perform at the NRL grand final. Swims was nominated for Best New Artist at this year\u2019s Grammy Awards and his most popular song, Lose Control, has two billion streams on Spotify.\n\nLoading How to watch the NRL grand final 2025? Every NRL and NRLW finals series match will be free on Channel 9 and 9NOW, while also broadcast on Fox League, Kayo Sports, Sky NZ and Watch NRL.

    "text": "Most of us have experienced tingling or \u201cgoosebumps\u201d at some point, especially when we feel a strong positive emotion such as awe or excitement.\n\nBut some people have this response when they listen to certain sounds. Online videos which feature sounds of people whispering, crackling packets, and brushing or combing a microphone are all geared towards making you feel this positive tingle \u2013 the autonomous sensory meridian response, or ASMR.\n\nNot everyone responds to ASMR content. But many who do say it makes them less anxious and helps them sleep. What does the science say?\n\nWhat is ASMR?\n\nASMR is an involuntary emotional and physical response, typically to a sound, which causes a reflexive tingling sensation on the scalp and back of the neck.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis multi-sensory experience can make us feel euphoria and \u201cpsychological stability\u201d, meaning we experience less inner turmoil and feel more calm.\n\nHowever, we still don\u2019t have much evidence about what happens in the brain and the body when this occurs.\n\nSome argue that ASMR is simply an example of frisson (French for \u201cshiver\u201d). This is when an intense emotional stimulus \u2013 such as a tender moment in a movie \u2013 triggers tingling or gives us \u201cthe chills\u201d.\n\nResearch suggests these so-called \u201cskin orgasms\u201d are due to a sudden rush of the chemical dopamine in the brain\u2019s reward centres.\n\nHowever, the sense of awe or inspiration felt during a frisson experience is brief, (typically 4\u20135 seconds). In contrast, ASMR is usually described as inducing an enduring state of calm.\n\nWhat triggers ASMR?\n\nAlmost everyone will jump out of their skins if they experience a sudden and loud sound. This is because we\u2019ve evolved to fear what is unpleasant or unexpected, to keep us safe from danger.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen it comes to sounds that can make us feel good, it\u2019s not as easy to confirm whether there are universal triggers \u2013 that is, sounds that would make most people have the same positive reaction.\n\nResearch in ASMR has identified some common triggers, including whispering, tapping and crackling sounds. But we can\u2019t say if these sounds would have the same effect on everyone.\n\nASMR videos often combine these sounds with video and role play known as \u201cpersonal attention\u201d. This means treating the camera like it is the viewer, speaking and interacting directly with it, and even simulating activities such as brushing hair or applying makeup to the viewer.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t it affect everyone?\n\nNot everyone responds to ASMR triggers, with some estimates suggesting only one in five people can experience ASMR.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhether or not you do is likely due to personality type and your predisposition to susceptibility, meaning how easily others can influence you.\n\nStudies have found those who respond are typically younger, experience more negative emotions, and are more introverted and critical. But they also tend to be more open to trying new things.\n\nSome research has suggested \u201cexpectancy effects\u201d could play a role. This is like a placebo \u2013 people who are invested in ASMR\u2019s potential as a therapeutic tool may be more likely to feel its effects.\n\nHowever, we still don\u2019t know precisely how ASMR works to induce positive emotions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMore than a dozen studies have reported on how the brain behaves during ASMR. But the findings across them are inconsistent and many have a very small number of participants or no comparison group, so we can\u2019t draw conclusions.\n\nStudies looking at the body\u2019s response during ASMR experiences have had similarly mixed results. Some have found people may experience both increased sweating (linked to the stress response) and decreased heart rate (linked to relaxation).\n\nTo describe this apparently contradictory state, some researchers have coined the term \u201carousing relaxation\u201d.\n\nAnother theory is that the social or erotic aspects of ASMR videos are a more important trigger than sounds or other stimuli \u2013 basically, that it is a kind of sexual arousal. But we would need more evidence on this.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWithout being able to identify universal triggers, it\u2019s also difficult to apply ASMR as an evidence-based tool in therapy. To date, there are no clinical trials that link ASMR with short- or long-term therapeutic effects.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNevertheless, many people in the \u201cwhisper community\u201d \u2013 those who produce and consume ASMR content online \u2013 claim ASMR helps them to relax, sleep better and reduce stress.\n\nSo, there\u2019s no harm in ASMR if it helps you relax. But we would need more research to establish whether it\u2019s effective as a clinical intervention for anxiety, insomnia or other conditions.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
