I feel we had zero economic policy to sell,\" she told ABC.\n\nOutgoing Liberal Senator Hollie Hughes cast doubt over Angus Taylor. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\n\"I don't know what he's been doing for three years.\n\n\"There was no tax policy, no economic narrative, and the fact that we're in a massive cost-of-living crisis, and Jim Chalmers has basically skated through unscathed.\"\n\nHughes claimed other Coalition members, as well as Labor members, share her views.\n\n\"[There is] frustration that they didn't have economic narratives that they co\ufeffuld push and sell during the election, and going from shadow treasurer, to opposition leader, I'm not quite sure that's going to change,\" she said.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said it would be \"extraordinary\" if Taylor was rewarded for \"one of the worst performances that I have ever seen\" with the leadership position. \ufeff\n\n\"It would be very strange if Angus Taylor escaped the blame for the Liberal Party debacle on Saturday,\" he told reporters this morning.\n\n\"Peter Dutton has stood up and taken some responsibility for that outcome. It is time for Angus Taylor to do the same.\n\n\"It would be extraordinary if Angus Taylor was rewarded with a promotion after the diabolical contribution he made to this history-making Coalition defeat.\ufeff\"\n\nTaylor has emerged as one of the names floated to be in the running for party leader , alongside deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley, \ufeffshadow immigration minister Dan Tehan and shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie.\n\nAngus Taylor is one of the few names in the running for new opposition leader. (AAP)\n\nDutton lost the federal election with an abysmal \ufeff39 seats, allowing Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to defy the polls and win his second term with a majority government of 87 seats.\n\nHe has been ousted from parliament after he also lost his seat of Dickson, which he held for 24 years, to Labor's Ali France .\n\nIt has made him the first opposition leader in Australian history to lose his seat and an election on the same night. \ufeff\n\nDutton took responsibility for the landslide defeat and a generational wipeout of senior Liberals, telling party faithfuls on Saturday night that he \"didn't do well enough during this campaign\".\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission is continuing to count votes\ufeff as some seats are still too close to call, but the headline results are unlikely to change.\n\nDutton's loss is tracking to be the worst-ever result at a federal election.\n\nLiberal members have made the rounds this morning post-defeat, with Senator Dave Sharma explaining that the party desperately needs to rebuild its appeal if it ever hopes to win government again. \ufeff\n\nAlbanese celebrates victory with coffee View Gallery\n\n\"There is no way we can ever hope to be the party of government unless we rebuild our appeal and our offering to those populations in the big cities, and then that will have to be our mission and will have to be, I think, probably our overwhelming focus as a party,\" he told ABC.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles refused to say who he wanted to see across the bench as new opposition leader and instead said that Labor will \"watch with interest\".\n\n\"That's ultimately a matter for them,\" he told Nine's Today. \ufeff\n\n\"I think we will watch with interest, obviously, how that all unfolds, but I'm not going to give the Liberals any gratuitous advice.\"",

In the next week, they'll vanish. (Max Mason-Hubers)\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) does not mandate what materials candidates use for signage nor how they dispose of signage after an election.\n\nThat means it's up to individual candidates to decide how they want to deal with their corflutes this week, whether they keep them for the next campaign, send them to landfill, or recycle them.\n\nOr repurpose them in some other way, like for the treatment of wombat mange\ufeff.\n\nM\ufeffost corflute signs are made from polypropylene, a category 5 plastic which is cheap, lightweight, and waterproof. It's also recyclable in certain conditions.\n\nWe say \"most\" because \ufeffCorflute is actually a brand name.\n\nAustralia's most trusted brands revealed View Gallery\n\nGenuine Corflute is a plastic twin-wall fluted sheet produced by Corex, an Australian company based in Victoria.\n\nOver time, the term corflute has come to be used for any Corflute-like corrugated plastic (much like how the brand name Perspex is used to describe any acrylic sheet).\n\nIt has also become synonymous with large election campaign signs, specifically fence signs and A-frames, which are colloquially referred to as corflutes.\n\nAnd recycling corflutes of any kind isn't as simple as tossing them into a yellow-lid recycling bin.\ufeff\n\nGenuine Corflute signs with no contaminants (eyelets, ties, etc) can be recycled through Corex, which operates its own closed-loop recycling facility in Melbourne.\n\n9news understands that campaign managers for multiple candidates have already contacted Corex about recycling corflutes after the 2025 federal election.\ufeff\n\nCorflutes from Independent Member for Kooyong Dr Monique Ryan's 2022 election campaign. Corflutes from past elections being recycled at a Corex facility.

    "text": "President Donald Trump said the US economy was a mixture of his enacted policies and the effects of the Biden administration in a wide-ranging interview on NBC's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker .\n\n\"I think the good parts are the 'Trump economy' and the bad parts are the 'Biden economy' because he's done a terrible job,\" Trump said in the interview.\n\nTrump recently completed his first 100 days in office, with 66 per cent of Americans saying they are pessimistic (29 per cent) or afraid (37 per cent) about the economy, according to a CNN/SSRS poll.\n\nDonald Trump is taking credit for the 'good' parts of the economy, but blaming the 'bad' on Joe Biden. (AP)\n\nJust 34 per cent say they feel enthusiastic or optimistic. Overall, 69 per cent of the public considers an economic recession in the next year to be at least somewhat likely, including 32 per cent who say that's very likely.\n\nTrump took credit for bringing costs down. \"I was able to get down the costs. But even that, it takes a while to get them down. But we got them down good,\" he said.\n\nAverage grocery prices were about 2.41 per cent higher in March 2025 than they were in March 2024, Consumer Price Index data shows. This was the highest year-over-year grocery inflation rate since August 2023.\n\nWelker asked Trump if he would \"take responsibility\" for the volatile stock market, which steeply declined after he announced sweeping, reciprocal tariffs.\n\n\"I've only just been here for a little more than three months. But the stock market, look at what's happened in the last short period of time. Didn't it have nine or 10 days in a row, or 11 days, where it's gone up? And the tariffs have just started kicking in. And we're doing really well,\" Trump said.\n\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 5686.67, down 6 per cent since January 21, the first trading session of Trump's term. On April 9, the S&P surged 9.5 per cent, its best daily performance in nearly 17 years, after Trump paused tariffs on most nations.\n\n\"What's going to happen with the market? I can't tell you, but I can tell you, our country has gotten a lot stronger, and eventually it'll be a country like no other,\" Trump said on April 6, while downplaying stock losses and adding, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"\n\nTrump was quick to blame his old enemy Joe Biden for the 'bad' parts of the economy. (AP)\n\nTrump has provided little reassurance to Americans and business owners about the short- and long-term effects of his economic policies, like the imposed 145 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, the removal of the de minimis exemption, rounds of tariffs on auto imports and a universal 10 per cent tariff rate during the 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWelker asked Trump: \"You're not taking the possibility that (some of) these tariffs could be permanent off the table?\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't do that. Because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?\" Trump said.\n\nWhile he's provided some relief to major companies, particularly car makers that received delays on tariffs and are now allowed some reimbursements on imported car parts, Trump declined to provide relief for small businesses.\n\n\"They're not going to need it,\" he told Welker.\n\nTrump on a possible recession: 'Anything can happen'\n\nTrump said he did \"take responsibility for everything,\" adding that \"the tariffs are going to make us rich. We're going to be a very rich country.\"\n\nBut concerns about the impact of tariffs have caused an increasing number of Americans to worry about a potential recession.\n\nIn April, JPMorgan said the odds of a recession were 60 per cent, up from 40 per cent. Goldman Sachs said the odds of a recession were 45 per cent.\n\n\"Everything's OK,\" Trump told Welker. \"This is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically.\"\n\nTrump added that he was not worried about a recession. But when asked if he thought a recession could happen, he said, \"anything can happen\".\n\nWelker asked Trump about rising prices on goods due to tariffs. Trump said consumers may need to purchase fewer goods.\n\n\"I don't think that a beautiful baby girl needs \u2026 to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable,\" Trump said.\n\nAmid his ongoing battle with the economy, Trump has repeatedly attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. He recently called Powell \"a major loser\" whose \"termination cannot come soon enough.\"\n\nThe comments left some wondering if Trump would attempt to fire Powell before the Fed chair's term ends in 2026. Trump has said he has \"no intention of firing\" Powell.\n\nIn the interview with Welker, Trump reiterated that he would not fire Powell, saying that he would already \"get to change him very quickly anyway.\"",

(Supplied: Alison Henderson)\n\nDemand for genetic information is growing, according to surveys by Meat and Livestock Australia.\n\nA 2016 survey conducted by the organisation found 30 per cent of sheep producers considered genetics when selecting their rams.\n\nIn 2024, that number had risen to an estimated 56 per cent.\n\nAlso assisting producers with better sheep productivity is neXtgen Agri chief executive Mark Ferguson, who also has seen a significant increase in the use of genetics.\n\n\"Over the last five years we've seen a bit of a momentum shift,\" he said.\n\n\"So essentially, we are improving productivity, as well as decreasing cost, and decreasing some of the time required to manage animals by making them more resilient to some of the challenges.\"\n\nCan you droughtproof a sheep?\n\n\"You can't make them bomb proof,\" Mr Ferguson said, but you can select traits focused on good fat and muscle.\n\nThis meant the sheep needed less energy and could maintain its weight.\n\n\"[This] obviously means less supplementary feeding in a drought, or under the same conditions, [the sheep] will lose less weight than another standing next to it,\" Mr Ferguson said.\n\nThe sheep at Alison Henderson's property are being hand-fed during the dry conditions. (ABC North & West SA: Arj Ganesan)\n\nThis is good news for Alison Henderson who is currently handfeeding all her sheep.\n\nGenetics also plays a key role in managing dry conditions by informing decision-making around which sheep to keep and which to destock.\n\n\"I guess I'm a fairly optimistic person so I look for a silver lining in bad situations,\" she said.\n\n\"It [was] a good opportunity to consolidate the genetic pool that we want to take forward.\"\n\nMs Henderson foresees the sheep industry being reshaped for the better by new technologies in the same way cropping has been adapting to shifting climate conditions.\n\n\"When you look at cropping \u2026 technology and precision agriculture \u2026 [it has] really taken the cropping industry forward,\" she said.\n\n\"The same thing is starting to happen with the sheep industry.\"",

    "text": "Magic Round mostly avoided the sort of refereeing controversy that many feared would rear its ugly head.\n\nThere were strange calls such as Ronaldo Mulitalo's spectacular effort against the Eels that shouldn't have warranted a penalty but did. And, if it did, should have been a penalty try, but wasn't.\n\nEven in that instance, both teams got a little lucky, so we move on.\n\nMost importantly, the high-tackle crackdown that undeniably poisoned round eight was by the wayside. It meant some shots went without penalties \u2014 a simple fact of life in a quickfire contact sport accepted by all but the most putrid homers \u2014 and the games flowed like they should.\n\nBut it turns out we were just saving all the drama up for the final game on Sunday as Canberra proved once again to be as real a deal as a team can be with the 20-18 golden-point win over Melbourne.\n\nGerard Sutton sent two players to the sin-bin in golden point. (Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\nThe Raiders came out with a game plan to aggravate the Storm with typically aggressive line speed and some extras in the tackle, and it worked a treat, especially in the biggest moments.\n\nThe penalties against Trent Loiero and Stefano Utoikamanu for lashing out at tacklers with the ball in a match-winning position are the sort of 50/50 decisions that may well have gone the other way at the opposite end of the field.\n\nLoiero came down on Joe Tapine and Utoikamanu dragged his foot into Tom Starling as both Raiders were hanging on in the ruck with the Storm set up for game-winning field goals.\n\n\"We're playing rugby league. You're trying to get a quick play of the ball. It's a tough thing to swallow,\" Ryan Papenhuyzen told ABC Sport.\n\n\" [Utoikamanu's] gonna be on report for that and watch him get off it. \u2026 Probably shouldn't have said that. \"\n\nPapenhuyzen's prediction proved correct on Monday morning as Utoikamanu and Loiero both escaped sanctions from the match review committee, but they won't be so lucky in the team's review session.\n\n\"We do have to be better. That's the way they're going to officiate the game now and we've got to respond to that,\" Papenhuyzen added.\n\nThe simple fact is both Storm players allowed themselves to be rattled and it cost their team the game.\n\nTrent Loiero asked the referee what he was supposed to do to avoid giving away the match-losing penalty. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nLoiero is nibbling around the edges of State of Origin selection but if he can't keep his composure in that sort of game, Billy Slater will have reservations about picking a man likely to spontaneously combust in the pressure of Origin.\n\nUtoikamanu has been in that arena, but that 2023 debut feels like a lifetime ago. The 24-year-old is starting to build some form and couldn't be in a better system for his development.\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every round of the AFL and NRL seasons in 2025.\n\nHe needs to respond to coach Craig Bellamy, who after the game said Big Stef might have been the only player he's ever seen give away two penalties as the attacking player in a game, both in prime attacking positions at crucial moments.\n\n\"If he was in the wrong, he needs to pick his discipline up,\" Bellamy told reporters.\n\n\"It's unlike anyone, it is. You show me a bloke that gives away two penalties when he's got the ball in the game, I'm thinking you're not looking at too many people.\n\n\" And to do it in the one game, it cost us, it cost us dearly. We just need to be a bit more disciplined. \"\n\nTo focus solely on the controversial, game-deciding but not explicitly wrong decisions would be a disservice to a contest that was one of the matches of the year.\n\nMelbourne's attack was typically scintillating and, for perhaps the first time this season, the defence just about matched it.\n\nABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women's Sport Survey: We want to hear from you Photo shows A stylised graphic with three silhouettes of unidentified a female footballer, tennis player, basketballer ABC Sport and Deakin University have partnered to produce the first ABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women\u2019s Sport Survey.\n\nSua Fa'alogo, one of the most promising young players in the league, had the most complete performance of his career, playing a crucial hand in all three Storm tries, including scoring the final one.\n\nFor the Raiders, Kaeo Weekes proved the game-breaker with his gorgeous chip-and-chase try in the wet, but Hudson Young, Joe Tapine and Jamal Fogarty all had dominant outings.\n\nRicky Stuart's side showed their usual grit as they came back from another early deficit to claim a fourth-straight win.\n\nAnd with three of those victories coming against Canterbury, Cronulla and now Melbourne, we can do away with the idea that this team is anything less than a premiership contender.",

    "text": "The Tasmanian government will resist the temptation of partnering with the private sector to fund and build its proposed Hobart stadium \u2014 and instead go it alone via a Macquarie Point borrowings bonanza.\n\nThe ABC can reveal the government will fund construction of the stadium via debt obtained through the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC), on top of $630 million of already committed state, federal and AFL funding.\n\nThe decision was rubberstamped by cabinet last week, following a market-sounding exercise and was based partly on advice from Perth consultants Paxon Group and the Melbourne-based Infrastructure Advisory Group.\n\nThe government will pivot toward a \"design and construct\" model and away from a \"private-public partnership\", which it determined would carry too high a risk to the state and threaten already tight timelines.\n\nIt then intends to sell off parcels of the broader Macquarie Point precinct to private developers and use those funds to pay off the loan \u2014 which is likely to be upwards of $200 million.\n\nThe proposed stadium is due to be completed by 2029. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nIndependent review finds new Hobart stadium costs to 'exceed $1 billion' Photo shows A concept image of the proposed Hobart stadium at Macquarie Poi nt. A leading independent economist tasked with reviewing Tasmania's proposal to build an AFL stadium on Hobart's waterfront finds the project is \"already displaying the hallmarks of mismanagement\" and is likely to exceed $1 billion.\n\nThe parcels would include about 17,000 square metres of commercially zoned space encompassing Macquarie Point's \"mixed use\" and Antarctic precinct, as well as the housing precinct at Regatta Point, and an underground multi-storey car park.\n\nUnder the plan, those parcels will become available following commencement of the stadium \u2014 provided it is approved by both houses of parliament \u2014 with the market value of the land expected to rise as the stadium development progresses.\n\nHowever, those land sales are not expected to cover the full amount of the loan.\n\nThe MPDC will use existing funds to pay for the stadium build and, on current timelines, is not expected to borrow until about 2027 or later.\n\nThe state government plans to introduce \"enabling legislation\" to the parliament to progress the stadium, rather than continuing with the Project of State Significance process. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nThe current official cost estimate for the stadium is $775 million but has been estimated by external quantity surveyors to be closer to $900 million.\n\nThe state government has pledged $375 million in capital funding, while the federal government has committed $240 million and the AFL $15 million, leaving at minimum a $145 million shortfall, but the loan amount will likely be higher than that.\n\nPublic-private partnership would have left state worse off, minister says\n\nPublic infrastructure funders from around the world had expressed strong interest in partnering with the government to deliver the stadium and broader precinct, with the ABC confirming Tetris Capital, John Laing Group, Capella Capital and property developer Milieu \u2014 which was set to develop the site under a previous master plan \u2014 were among those keen.\n\nMelbourne-based Plenary Group, which had assembled a consortium, including a financier and builder, was considered the frontrunner had the government opted to partner with the private sector.\n\nBut in a statement, Business, Industry and Resources Minister Eric Abetz told the ABC that the government's advice was that a private-public partnership would ultimately leave the state worse off.\n\nEric Abetz says the new funding model will help the stadium be built on time. (ABC News: Owain Stia James)\n\nMr Abetz said it would \"cost the taxpayer more, take longer to implement and take away from the asset being owned by and for the Tasmanian people\".\n\n\"The decision to prioritise the delivery of the multipurpose stadium through a 'design and construct' pathway provides certainty and confidence in the future of the precinct and the Tasmania Devils AFL club,\" he said.\n\n\" We cannot afford any delays if we are to meet existing time frames set out in the AFL agreement. Without a stadium, there is no Tasmanian AFL team. \"\n\nThe government's deal with the AFL requires a roofed stadium be built at Macquarie Point for the state to get a team. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nPlenary managing director Damien Augustinus told the ABC he believed a private-public partnership would \"deliver greater innovation, more certainty around on-time delivery and costs, and better whole-of-life outcomes than traditional design and construct or managing contract procurement methods\".\n\nMr Augustinus said involving the private sector would \"mean more investment in Tasmania, creating more Tasmanian jobs and permit a cohesive whole-of-precinct approach\".\n\n\" In the Macquarie Point precinct, the Tasmanian government has a golden opportunity to partner with the private sector to finance, deliver and manage a world-class sporting, tourism and entertainment precinct. \"\n\nA render of a bar inside the relocated and re-imagined Goods Shed, next to the proposed stadium. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nWhat's a private-public partnership?\n\nA private-public partnership (PPP) would mean a public infrastructure firm would fund a shortfall, construct the stadium, and then enter an agreement with the government to maintain, and potentially operate, the stadium and precinct for 25-30 years.\n\nA list of stadium problems \u2014 from crowd squeeze to bus freeze Photo shows A map showing pinch points on three out of the four sides of a stadium and nearby areas. Macquarie Point is hemmed in by a highway, a working port, heritage buildings and a knoll, with just enough space for a stadium. The Planning Commission has laid bare the problems.\n\nThe government would have paid the consortium an agreed upon annual or quarterly fee, and likely a slice of revenue generated by the precinct for that period of time.\n\nIndependent economist Saul Eslake said that while tempting, private-public partnerships had their pitfalls.\n\n\"Because it's usually believed the private sector can manage construction projects more efficiently than the public sector, that is assumed to result in a net saving to the government,\" he said.\n\n\"What PPPs sometimes ignore is that governments can borrow at lower interest rates than private companies, and in many PPPs that have been entered to in other states and in overseas jurisdictions, the private participants often find ways through complex legal contracts find ways to transfer risk back to the public sector.\"\n\nSaul Eslake says private-public partnerships have their pitfalls. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)\n\nMr Eslake said borrowing through the MPDC would provide the government with some budgetary camouflage \u2014 but that ultimately it will still be public money that will be borrowed and needs to be paid back, with interest.\n\n\"If the government were to borrow through TASCORP in its own name, that would be reflected in the government's budget deficit and would add to the government's net debt,\" he said.\n\n\"But if the Macquarie Point Development Corporation were to borrow \u2014 they would not appear in the general government's deficit and net debt, but rather in that of the public and non-financial corporation sector.\n\n\"Although that would be disclosed in the budget papers, the borrowings of GBEs [government business enterprises] and other public non-financial corporations don't get as much attention or scrutiny.\"\n\nCrucial independent MLC 'pleased' with change in funding\n\nIndependent MLC Ruth Forrest, who holds a crucial upper house vote on the stadium, is not yet sold on the project, but said she was \"pleased\" the government had rejected a private-public partnership and that it would \"absolutely\" influence her vote.\n\n\"It's critical in my mind,\" Ms Forrest said.\n\nPoll reveals support levels for proposed Hobart stadium across Tasmania Photo shows Concept art showing interior of sports stadium with cricket match underway. If it wasn't already official, it is now: The proposed Hobart stadium is massively on the nose among many Tasmanians.\n\n\"It won't cost the state any more, because ultimately, we'd be underwriting any private-public partnership I would imagine.\n\n\"It's more transparent because the people of Tasmania will have more vision of what it'll actually cost.\"\n\nMs Forrest still wants answers to key questions raised by the Tasmanian Planning Commission as well as surety around the ongoing operating model of the stadium.\n\n\"I'll need to be really clear about the operations of the food and beverage, the hospitality, the venue space, what that looks like. We need to own all of that, operate and control all of that to be assured it can be a sustainable model,\" she said.\n\nGreens say government's taxpayer funding promise is broken\n\nThe government has long insisted its funding toward the stadium was capped at $375 million and \"not a red cent more\".\n\nThe Greens, who have long opposed the stadium, said the decision to switch the funding model signalled a \"huge broken promise\".\n\n\"The premier said 'not a red cent more' than $375 million would be spent on the stadium, but now Tasmanian taxpayers are responsible for many hundreds of millions of dollars more than he promised,\" Greens deputy leader Vica Bayley said.\n\n\"The Liberal government's talk of private investment has always been a ploy to mislead the community about the true cost of the stadium to the taxpayer.\n\n\"There's no good model for funding the stadium, which is why the government should scrap it.\"",

(ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nChurch deacon Megan Williams, who has been attending the Canberra church her entire life, pleaded its case to the association ahead of the vote in Sydney.\n\nShe said she the result gave her both a deep sadness and joy.\n\n\"[I have] a sense of being so proud of a church community who have stood up and said, 'We want to be a place where everyone is invited,'\" Deacon Williams said.\n\n\"That joy of feeling like you've done the right thing and you've stood up for your principles and values.\"\n\nA welcoming space\n\nMoving forward, parishioners such as Steph Evans feel confident the church will remain unified and have a strong future.\n\nSteph Evans says she felt welcome from the moment she stepped inside the church. (ABC News)\n\nShe joined in August while looking for a space where she could \"be her whole self\".\n\n\"A space where I could welcome any single person into the church and invite my friends and invite my family,\" Ms Evans said.\n\n\"For me, being an Aboriginal person, that was really important to find a church where Aboriginal culture was honoured and celebrated and recognised.\n\n\" I am welcomed so wholeheartedly, and any person that I've seen enter that church has been met with that same love and that generosity in time. \"\n\nDavid Stafford started attending Sunday school at Canberra Baptist church in the late 1940s. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nDavid Stafford has been attending the church for more than 60 years.\n\nHe said he was disappointed the association had disaffiliated the churches over \"a relatively minor disagreement\", especially \"when we're not all being knocked over in a rush to fill churches anymore\".\n\nBut Mr Stafford said the future looked bright.\n\n\"I think it is in a really good place. Church numbers rise and fall a bit, but it's in a good place \u2026 we're very fortunate,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm at an age where you do what you're interested in doing, and not as active as we used to be, but we still love it. It's still our church.\n\n\" And the sun came up again this morning, even though we've been disaffiliated. \"\n\n'We don't hold any animosity'\n\nIn a statement, the NSW and ACT Baptist Association said member churches \"support the association's shared beliefs, positions and values\", including \"a long-established statement on marriage that was reviewed and reaffirmed in 2022\".\n\nThe association said the decision to disaffiliate Canberra and Hamilton was the \"outcome of a clear process previously agreed by our assembly, and included significant engagement with both churches\".\n\n\"We don't hold any animosity toward Canberra Baptist and Hamilton Baptist churches. We still respect and love them as churches and as people,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We have processes and resources in place to continue to support them throughout this transition and into the future.",

(AFL.com.au)\n\nMr Hine also oversaw the selection of Steele Sidebottom and Jordan De Goey, as well as trades that secured Jack Crisp from Brisbane and Tasmanian Jeremy Howe from Melbourne.\n\nMr Hine and Mr Patterson's first task will likely be assembling the club's inaugural VFL list, which is set to take the field next year. They'll then move into helping construct the Devils' inaugural AFL team, which is set to play its first game in 2028.\n\nMr Hine will initially split his time between Melbourne and Hobart.\n\nIn a statement, Devils chief executive Brendon Gale said Mr Hine's recruitment was a \"significant addition\" to the club and that \"his passion for talent identification and team building aligns perfectly with our vision for the Tasmania Devils\".\n\n\"It's a really exciting time for football in the state,\" he said.\n\nPair to access salary war chest\n\nMr Patterson, who hails from Launceston, will return to his home state following a 16-year stint in Victoria, with an eight-year stint at Melbourne, which included women's talent identification and ultimately a six-year term as the club's AFLW list manager.\n\nThe Demons won the AFLW flag in 2022 and have been a long-time powerhouse of the women's competition.\n\nTodd Patterson will join the Devils as the club's head of list management and strategy. (Melbourne Football Club)\n\nTasmania's women's team is slated to enter the AFLW in 2027, making the Devils the first club in history to field a women's team before a men's side.\n\nBoth Mr Patterson and Mr Hine will officially start later this month, and have been employed on full-time, permanent contracts.\n\nThe pair will be handed about a dozen first-round picks, which will be spread across the 2027, 2028 and 2029 drafts, and which could still possibly include the number one pick in 2027.\n\nSome of those will likely need to be traded for established players.\n\nThe Tasmania Devils are slated to enter the AFLW in 2027, while the men's team is due to enter the league in 2028. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nMr Patterson and Mr Hine will also likely have access to a salary war chest that will be used to lure players from other clubs, as well as to uncontracted free agents from other clubs across two trade periods.\n\nThe appointments come as Tasmania's parliamentarians prepare to vote on so far unseen special legislation that aims to fast track the approval of the proposed Macquarie Point stadium.\n\nThe proposed stadium, which is expected to cost more than $775 million, is a non-negotiable requirement of the Devils entering the AFL, but has been met with strong community opposition.\n\nIt has bipartisan support in the state's lower house but will need the vote of at least two independent upper house members to progress.",

Now he spends two days a week working close to home, in his own community, in south-east Tasmania.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeacher Belinda Vallerine has seen participating students' confidence grow. (ABC Hobart: Lucie Cutting) Aside from alleviating the stress of a long commute, there are many benefits for students who participate in the program, according to Mr Giles' teacher at Rosny College, Belinda Vallerine.\n\nOver the years she had been involved with the program, Ms Vallerine said she had witnessed apprentices and trainees becoming more self-assured.\n\n\"They come back with real confidence. They feel confident in their workplace and they're confident in their school environment as well,\" she said.\n\nMs Giles said he had made some good friends at the council, and having the opportunity to work there while still at school had made him less anxious about finding more employment after he left college.\n\nFellow student Ms Perkins had also become more confident.\n\nKayla Perkins will have an early childhood education qualification by the time she finishes school. (ABC Hobart: Lucie Cutting)\n\n\"It's an opportunity to be a responsible adult,\" she said.\n\nMs Perkins is completing a Certificate III in Early Childhood Education alongside her school studies.\n\n\"I love being that person children look up to, and [being] a good role model for them,\" she said.\n\nTraineeship supports local talent\n\nMs Wilson said employing a school-based trainee had been a great experience for Tasman Council and a positive move for the local community.\n\nThe Tasman municipality is made up of a small and aging population of fewer than 2,700 people. It also had high unemployment.\n\nMs Wilson said Tasman Council had wanted to support a young community member in the hope of retaining local talent \u2014 but she initially had reservations about inviting a school-aged employee into the council workforce.\n\nHarper Giles works two days a week for the Tasman Council. (Supplied: Harper Giles)\n\n\"I was expecting, particularly with a male teenager, they can get a bit quiet, shy or surly,\" she said.\n\n\" Harper has smashed the mould when it comes to that. Being able to watch him grow from this quiet person to a real professional \u2026 it's excellent. \"\n\nNew apprenticeship funding Photo shows Electricians place solar panels on roof The most recent data shows apprenticeship numbers haven't kept pace with population growth, with more than half of apprentices not completing their training.\n\nMs Wilson said there were some challenges to work around, such as a trainee's availability which was limited by school and studies, and having to ensure staff working directly with a teenage employee were registered to work with vulnerable people.\n\nBut she said the benefits were worth the effort.\n\n\"There is a cost to the organisation but the benefit to that person, their family and the community, outweighs the cost,\" she said.\n\n\"And just knowing they're walking away with a qualification that could take them anywhere is really encouraging and I'd encourage other councils to do it.\"\n\nApprentice, trainee trends\n\nThere are approximately 650 school-based trainees and apprentices in Tasmania, accounting for about 7 per cent of the state's overall apprenticeships and traineeships.\n\nLee Xavier would like to see more government incentives for employers to take on trainees. (Supplied )\n\nNationally, apprenticeships such as carpentry and plumbing are increasing in popularity over traineeships in hospitality, retail and business administration.\n\nApprenticeship Support Australia chief executive Lee Xavier said he would like to see an increase in trainees and apprentices, and suggested this could be achieved by more incentives being built into the program to attract employers.\n\n\"We do know that it costs the business a bit of time and money,\" Mr Xavier said.\n\n\" So any incentives that can be built back into the system are normally a trigger for the employer to be able to allow that position to open up. \"\n\nA strategic review by the federal government into the incentive system was released in February and further consultation was underway.\n\nDisengaged youth program Photo shows Two young people hold bushes and are looking down as they clean pieces of ginger This program takes younger students out of school to offer hands-on learning experiences to showcase life outside the classroom.\n\nMs Vallerine, who oversees 13 student-based trainees and apprentices but has previously worked with 70, said she would also like to see more students and employers become involved in the program.\n\n\"There are some students that don't suit school, and I think if we can offer that two-day opportunity in a workplace I think our [retention] would increase because they have that work-life balance,\" she said.\n\n\" If we have more [opportunities], I feel we could engage a lot more students. \"",

    "text": "Most of us have tried our hands at the piano at some stage. Maybe that's playing Chopsticks with a friend, picking out our favourite song, or more dedicated learning.\n\nThe piano features across all western music traditions, from classical music, through jazz and into the popular music we listen to today.\n\nIf the internet is to be believed, as many as 40 million people play piano. The data is sketchy, but there's no doubt it's one of the most popular instruments in the world.\n\nAnd the instrument means a lot to people.\n\n\"It's been a powerful emotional and artistic touchpoint for me throughout my life,\" says ABC presenter Jeremy Fernandez, who started learning the instrument when he was seven.\n\nAustralian concert pianist, Tamara-Anna Cislowska started learning when she was about 18 months old and recorded her first music for the ABC when she was just three.\n\nShe thinks that people connect so strongly with the instrument because \"the piano can read and interpret real emotion.\"\n\nWhat's your favourite music for the piano? Photo shows A dark blue piano from birds eye view with the words Classic 100 Piano written on top, on a background of colourful swirls Voting is now open in the Classic 100: Piano. Tell us your favourites and we'll be counting down Australia's top 100 choices across June 7 and 8 on ABC Classic and the ABC listen app.\n\nABC Classic is celebrating the piano in its annual poll to find Australia's favourite classical music, the Classic 100.\n\nEvery year the network asks Australians to vote for their favourite music in a particular theme, counting down the top 100 across two days. 2025's theme is the piano.\n\nTo honour this versatile and beloved instrument, we explore a brief history of the piano in music.\n\nMusic for the piano before the instrument even existed\n\nPianos as we know them today are a relatively recent invention.\n\nBartolomeo Cristofori invented the piano in Padua in 1700. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe piano itself was invented around 1700, evolving into an instrument more like the one we know today in the 1800s. But keyboard instruments, and the music written for them, have been around a lot longer.\n\nPossibly the most famous and beloved by pianists is the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, who was writing for keyboard instruments like the organ, harpsichord and clavichord during the late 1600s and early 1700s.\n\nThis music is still inspiring pianists today, such as the now centuries-popular Well-Tempered Clavier collections and the Goldberg Variations.\n\nThe musical foundations in Bach's music lay the groundwork for most of the music we enjoy today. You can even find excerpts of Bach's music in songs by The Beatles, Lady Gaga and others.\n\nCislowska also calls out Domenico Scarlatti, who was composing during a similar period. She credits Scarlatti with demonstrating what the piano might be capable of.\n\n\"He did all these innovative things like showing you could repeat notes, or cross over the hands. No-one crossed over the hands before Scarlatti.\"\n\nThe piano as the rising star of the orchestra\n\nBach primarily wrote his music for God, but it was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who moved the piano to rockstar status during the last half of the 18th century.\n\nMozart was a child prodigy. He was considered one of the best keyboard players of the time and played for some of Europe's most famous figures.\n\nDuring Bach's era, the keyboard was often found supporting other instruments in ensemble or orchestral music. We can thank Mozart for making the piano the star of the show and making the piano concerto so popular.\n\nMozart's sister Nannerl was also reported to be an exceptional pianist, touring with her brother when they were young. None of her music survived, but there's evidence that she did compose, and some scholars believe she contributed to some of Mozart's music.\n\nWhile he was just 35 when he died, Mozart wrote 27 piano concertos and swathes of piano sonatas and other music for the keyboard that is still loved today. This includes pieces like his sonata 'Rondo alla Turca', or his variations on the popular French children's song Ah! vous dirai-je, maman. You might recognise this as the tune to Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\n\nLoading...\n\nHot on Mozart's heels was Ludwig van Beethoven, also an incredible keyboard player. His piano music, along with new advances in the instrument, like stronger frames and a bigger sound, stretched the piano to new places.\n\nSome of his music was written for his piano students in the early 19th century, and that music is still a staple for music students today. Almost anyone who's had piano lessons has tried to play Beethoven's F\u00fcr Elise or the Moonlight Sonata.\n\nBut his music could also be explosive and passionate like his later piano sonatas.\n\nMuch of Beethoven's later, and more difficult, music was written when he was completely deaf.\n\nLoading...\n\nFainting and fan frenzy\n\nAs we reach the 19th century, the drama of Beethoven's late piano music unfolds in a new way.\n\nMusic becomes freer and more expressive. And more virtuosic, leading to the rise of pianist celebrities.\n\nThe reclusive Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin wrote music that still pushes piano technique today and brought a new poetry to the instrument. His music ranged from the introspection lyricism of his Preludes and Nocturnes to the fireworks of Waltzes, Polonaises and Etudes.\n\nLoading...\n\nCislowska credits much of Chopin's innovation to his use of the sustain pedal, which lets the notes of the instrument ring for longer.\n\n\"He found the soul of the piano because when you use the pedal with the piano and you play it in a certain way you can make it sound more like the human voice,\" she says.\n\n\" Without the pedal, the piano is not alive. \"\n\nAround the same time Franz Liszt inspired the term Lisztomania for the fan frenzy at his concerts.\n\n\"I think Liszt contributed more to music, and to every aspect of music and performance than probably anyone else has,\" says Cislowska.\n\nLiszt paved the way for the concert pianist as we know it today, but Cislowska says \"he was much more than just a pianist.\"\n\nHis piano transcriptions helped spread music like Beethoven symphonies and Wagner operas to new audiences and he was also a champion for his peers, like Chopin and Clara and Robert Schumann, performing them alongside his own music.\n\nClara Schumann was a champion of composers like her husband Robert, Liszt and Chopin, playing their music before they were household names. (Getty Images: Hulton Archive)\n\nAround the same time, a young Clara Wiek (who would go on to marry another pianist, Robert Schumann) was a renowned touring pianist. She is credited with popularising the practice of memorising music for concerts.\n\nA respected composer herself, Schumann's music mostly fell into obscurity after her death. Her music is gaining popularity again as contemporary artists champion her work.\n\nFollowing a little later was the Russian composer Rachmaninov. His music can be daunting for players, comprising of huge stretches of the fingers and a lot of notes.\n\n\"A lot of people think it's very virtuosic music. It's not at all. It's just that we're not able to play it because we don't have hands like Rachmaninov\u2026he could play fingering that no-one else could ever play,\" says Cislowska.\n\nPiano music to convey a mood\n\nHalf a century after Liszt was making audience members swoon with his pianistic pyrotechnics, composers in France were taking the piano in a new direction.\n\nFernandez couldn't pick a single piano favourite, but \"I do love Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel for how dreamy their music is,\" he says.\n\nInspired by other artists working around them, like painter Claude Monet, composers like Erik Satie and his friend Debussy focused on conveying mood and atmosphere more symbolically. They also borrowed musical languages from non-western traditions and ragtime.\n\nThe music took advantage of modern additions to the piano, like the sostenuto pedal (the middle pedal on most grand pianos that allows only select notes to ring after they're played), to create washes of sound and musical colour.\n\nLeading the charge was the eccentric Satie, who drew on ancient and esoteric influences for music like his beloved Gymnop\u00e9dies and Gnossiennes.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nDebussy's evocative music often used highly descriptive names like \"The Sunken Cathedral\" and \"The Girl with the Flaxen Hair.\"\n\nEven if you don't think you know anything about classical music you would probably recognise his Clair de lune [Moonlight].\n\nThe music has had countless features on screen from that awkward conversation between Edward and Bella in Twilight, to the surreal foot performance by Jamie Lee Curtis in Everything Everywhere All at Once's hot-dog finger universe.\n\nEmbracing new musical styles in the New World\n\nAround the same time in North America, pianists like Scott Joplin were popularising music with African American roots.\n\nThe piano was central to the sound of ragtime and is credited as a distinctly American music.\n\nJoplin's Maple Leaf Rag was one of the early hits of published music, with some claiming it was the first piece of instrumental music to sell over a million copies.\n\nRagtime and the music of Joplin went on to influence early jazz and American composers like George Gershwin.\n\nGershwin's iconic Rhapsody in Blue bridged the gap between classical and jazz with its luscious melody and jazzy harmony.\n\nLoading Facebook content\n\nYou might know it from Disney's Fantasia, or Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. It also featured in 1984 Summer Olympics in LA, performed by 84 pianists.\n\nSearching for the sound of Australia\n\nThe first piano made its way to Australia in 1788, and the instrument has been a firm part of musical life since.\n\nMany composers have looked to the Australian landscape, such as Miriam Hyde's Reflected Reeds, evoking the Sydney Landscape, or much of Peter Sculthorpe's music.\n\nFernandez says he also sees these influences in the music of pianist Nat Bartsch. \"Her compositions are, to me, vivid renderings of the Australian landscape, and a heart full of love and tenderness.\"\n\nMany composers have brought influences from multicultural experiences, like Uzbekistan-born, Russian, Australian and German trained Elena Kats-Chernin, whose music is flavoured with the multitude of her lived experiences.\n\nJust one example is her Russian Rag for piano, which draws on the ragtime traditions of composers like Joplin, but Kats-Chernin has said it also references Russian caf\u00e9 music.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe music of Australia's First Peoples has also been a frequent inspiration for Australian piano music, but in recent years more First Nations artists are telling their own musical stories through the medium of the piano.\n\nIn 2020, Four First Nations composers brought their perspectives to 250 years of shared Indigenous and European history in music for a 250-year-old square piano in Ngarra-Burria Piyanna. In the work Rhyan Clapham, Elizabeth Sheppard, Tim Gray and Nardi Simpson each bring a different story to an historic piano akin to the first piano to arrive in Australia in 1788.\n\nThe piano and the screen\n\nThe piano has been there since the dawn of the silver screen. Once providing soundtracks live to silent movies, it's still an essential part of scores for film, TV and video games.\n\nThe French classic Am\u00e9lie wouldn't be the same without the joyful, whimsical piano score and Michael Nyman's The Heart Asks Pleasure First has become a repertoire staple.\n\nAnd the piano is central to Joe Hisaishi's scores for the beloved Studio Ghibli films.\n\n\"The piano is very sensitive,\" he told ABC Classic's Dan Golding in 2020. \"It sings the melody line, and the screen world comes alive much more easily.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nA new love affair with the piano\n\nIn the last decade the piano has seen a resurgence in popularity. You're just as likely to see sold-out concerts by pianist-composers like Ludovico Einaudi, Max Richter, Yiruma, and Hania Rani as you are the latest indie-pop sensation.\n\nEinaudi is the most streamed classical artist of all time, ahead of the likes of Bach and Beethoven.\n\nLoading...\n\nCislowska thinks that in our \"cacophonous world\" it's interesting that audiences are gravitating to these pianists who use a lot of repetition in their music.\n\n\"When you gravitate towards hearing repetitive sounds it's because it helps you to turn inward. You can go within instead of being forced to be without all the time,\" she suggests.\n\nThere's always more to explore\n\nCislowska believes that with the piano \"the possibilities are endless.\".\n\nThere is always so much more piano music to explore. What we often hear and talk about, like in this brief history, barely scratches the surface.\n\n\"There's just a handful of composers that we play from and then it's just a handful of their works,\" she says.\n\nThe Classic 100: Piano is your chance to discover some new favourites.\n\nVoting is now open in the Classic 100: Piano. There are over 400 pieces to sample on the voting list, many of which you will hear over the next month on ABC Classic. You can hear what made the top 100 across June 7 and 8 on ABC Classic and the ABC listen app.\n\nSign up to the ABC Classic Newsletter",

    "text": "\"Half-hearted.\"\n\n\"Not tough enough.\"\n\n\"Too comfortable.\"\n\n\"Absolute crap.\"\n\n\"Are we up for the challenge?\"\n\nThose were words used by Fremantle players or coaches to describe performances in recent weeks, as the club stumbles from one inconsistent performance to another.\n\nAnd after a 10-goal loss to St Kilda, in which Fremantle was held to the third-lowest half-time score in its 30-year history, the spotlight intensified on a squad experts said should be a top-eight side in the AFL.\n\nThe Dockers have lost four of eight games to start the season. (AAP Image/Joel Carrett)\n\nIt also led to questions about coach Justin Longmuir's tenure, as his team slid to a fourth loss in eight games this season.\n\n\"Does he [Longmuir] have the ability to stand up in front of the group, and make them want to run through a wall?\" Collingwood premiership player Sharrod Wellingham said on ABC Perth.\n\n\"Can he build the players up to want to jump out of their skin?\"\n\nA quick scroll through thousands of comments on the club's social media posts highlighted the frustration Dockers fans felt at the side's performances, summed up by poster Alex Merendino.\n\n\"Being a Fremantle Dockers fan is like signing up for emotional masochism year after year. It\u2019s as if the club exists to show you how far they can fall from their own potential, all while making sure you\u2019re along for every crushing second,\" he wrote.\n\nA rod for their own back\n\nThe frustration from fans is understandable, considering statements made by chief executive Simon Garlick in the build-up to this season.\n\n\"We believe that in 2025 and beyond, what we\u2019ve built here will be something opponents fear, the competition respects, and most importantly, our fans love,\" he said at the Dockers season launch.\n\n\"When you add the little things up, like we have over the last five years, we are giving ourselves the best chance we\u2019ve had to be in contention for a decade or more.\"\n\nDockers CEO Simon Garlick backed Justin Longmuir to be coaching in 2026, just hours before the clubs 10-goal loss to St Kilda. (AAP Image/Dave Hunt)\n\nAt four wins and four losses to open the season, playing finals seems a stretch, let alone contending for a premiership.\n\nBefore Fremantle ran out onto the Docklands surface to face St Kilda, Garlick made a statement that would have surprised most fans wondering when the talented side would deliver.\n\nAsked on ABC Sport if Longmuir would be the Dockers coach at the start of 2026, he was adamant in his response.\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely,\" Garlick said.\n\n\"JL [Longmuir] is doing a fantastic job. I think like any senior coach, they tend to get all the blame when a result doesn't go their way.\n\n\"And then when you win games of footy, the credit tends to get spread around a whole bunch of people.\"\n\nThree hours later, those words looked even more surprising, with experts slamming Fremantle's performance.\n\nThe Dockers recorded their third-lowest ever half-time score in Friday's loss to St Kilda at Docklands. (AAP Image/Joel Carrett)\n\n\"I've seen too many Dockers today, no names mentioned, ducking and weaving to avoid contact,\" coaching great Mick Malthouse said on the ABC's coverage.\n\n\"You look at it and you go: 'Hang on, you're in a position to actually impact that ball, and why did the St Kilda player get there before you?'\n\n\"You look like you're going to get there, but you ran past it. That's damning.\"\n\nDockers embarrassed in loss to Saints Photo shows Fremantle players walk off the ground disappointed Justin Longmuir admits he and his players will be forced to do some soul searching after the humiliating 61-point thrashing handed out by the Saints on Friday night.\n\nGeelong premiership captain Cameron Ling agreed.\n\n\"We had a team totally committed to an attitude of 'we are here to do everything we can to win this game'. And then we had a team who clearly picked and [chose],\" he said.\n\n\"They jumped out of the way a couple of times. They weren't up for the fight. The attitude wasn't there.\"\n\nEven Fremantle defender Jordan Clark didn't mince his words following the loss.\n\n\"To be honest, it's pretty f***ing disappointing,\" he told ABC Sport.\n\n\"We feel a lot of responsibility for an absolute crap performance tonight.\n\n\"There's a lot of frustrations, feelings running through each and every single one of our bodies at the moment.\"\n\nSix seasons and no return\n\nLongmuir is in his sixth season as Dockers coach, during which the team has played finals once, in 2022.\n\nLast season, they lost their last four games to drop from a top-four spot to outside the eight.\n\nIn 2025, the Dockers have lost to Geelong, Sydney, Melbourne and St Kilda, with only the Cats considered a realistic chance of making the eight.\n\nThere are serious questions Fremantle must wrestle with. Is the team not as good as analysts believe? Or is Justin Longmuir incapable of getting them to perform to their potential?\n\nThe Dockers play Collingwood (H), GWS (A), Port Adelaide (H), and Gold Coast (A) in the next four weeks. Their season, and possibly Longmuir's job, could be decided by the bye in round 13.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

The green and gold varieties are underlined by bold, botanical and tropical liqueurs made with parsley, passionfruit and the roots of the blue flowering gentian plant. The green negroni is a tart, herbaceous addition. Nikki To Herbs has transformed an \u201cempty concrete box\u201d site into a warm space with chequered black carpet, comfortable table seating and a throwback soundtrack of twangy indie tunes from the mid-2000s. \u201cThat kind of music is quite nostalgic for us,\u201d says Tulley. \u201cWe\u2019re in our mid-30s now, and I feel like every bar we do is an expression of the stage we\u2019re at in life \u2026 we\u2019re growing up, and our bars are maturing along with us.\u201d But mature doesn\u2019t have to mean serious. Blackmore, who has become known for creating a signature popcorn flavour at Mucho\u2019s other venues (Bar Planet\u2019s salty-sweet curry popcorn is particularly popular), has taken the complimentary snack to another level at Herbs Taverne.

    "text": "Not surprisingly, for more than two years, instead of using the torrents of cash his group has generated to buy expensive companies or shares Buffett has been building a stockpile of cash. Berkshire Hathaway now has a hoard of $US347.7 billion (about $540 billion). For Abel, how and when he deploys that cash will represent the major and reputation-defining challenge of his new role. Buffett\u2019s successor Greg Abel has been handed a poisoned chalice. Credit: Getty Abel is an operational guy, brought into Berkshire Hathaway when it acquired a stake in MidAmerican Energy in 1999. He built the energy business into a key pillar of the group\u2019s operating assets and now runs all Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s non-insurance operations, a portfolio of more than 180 operating companies that generated $US47.4 billion of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $US89.7 billion of first-quarter revenues. He\u2019s a manager, not an investor, with Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, the executives responsible for identifying targets for investment. Once he replaces Buffett, however, it is Abel who will have to make the big calls.\n\nBuffett has been a contrarian investor, often sitting on the markets\u2019 sidelines for considerable periods while waiting for opportunities \u2013 the \u201cstraw hats in winter,\u201d or counter-cyclical, approach that hardcore value investors pursue. Loading \u201cWe simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful,\u201d Buffett has said to explain his philosophy. In 2008, during the global financial crisis, that strategy was vindicated. Berkshire Hathaway stepped in during the worst of the crisis to buy cheap stakes in companies like Goldman Sachs, General Electric and Dow Chemical, driving very hard bargains in exchange for the calming influence its money and Buffett\u2019s reputation provided. Those sorts of opportunities don\u2019t, however, come that often.\n\nSince the crisis, Buffett has been relatively quiet, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s level of out-performance of the market has shrunk and its store of undeployed cash has soared, signalling that Buffett believes there isn\u2019t value in the market for either companies or shares in the current environment. His major play in recent years, unusually for a group largely focused on the US, has been the $US23.5 billion the group has invested in five of Japan\u2019s biggest trading houses. Abel\u2019s challenge will be to find value and the moment to use that cash on deals that are large enough to move the dial in what is now a $US1.2 trillion conglomerate. The big long-term holdings within Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment portfolio are companies like Amex, Coca-Cola, Bank of America and Apple. Credit: Bloomberg If Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies \u2013 his tariffs \u2013 were to push the US economy into recession, which is possible, that moment might arise. There is a lot of leverage in the US system. During the near meltdown in the US bond market earlier this year after Trump made his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement of reciprocal tariffs, hedge funds were scrambling to exit leveraged trades and the market for leveraged loans froze.\n\nThere are a lot of highly-leveraged hedge funds and private equity firms out there that would be stressed if economic conditions deteriorated markedly, or interest rates were to rise \u2013 or both, if Trump induces, as some fear, a stagflationary recession. \u2018We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.\u2019 Warren Buffett Buffett seems confident that those sorts of distressed asset sales will eventuate. \u201cWe will be bombarded with offerings that we\u2019ll be glad we had the cash for,\u201d he said at the weekend. That could release a lot of the kinds of hard assets that private equity targets and Buffett has always liked: companies with good management, strong franchises, protective \u201cmoats\u201d and solid cashflows and earnings.\n\nThe big long-term holdings within Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment portfolio are companies like Amex, Coca-Cola, Bank of America and, while he was late to that party, Apple, but the core portfolio of operating companies is centred on insurance, utilities and energy, railroads, and a collection of manufacturers and retailers. Whether those sorts of companies that have generally performed well in the past 60 years will generate similar performance in future is an open question. Artificial intelligence is expected to transform companies and industries in ways that are difficult to predict. For decades an increasing number of Buffett acolytes have made the pilgrimage to Omaha, Nebraska, to hear pearls of investing wisdom from the \u201cSage of Omaha\u201d. Credit: AP Buffett\u2019s philosophy was to avoid companies and technologies he didn\u2019t understand, so he didn\u2019t invest in companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and only started investing in Apple \u2013 the star of the portfolio \u2013 in early 2016, nine years after Steve Jobs launched the first iPhone and transformed a company now worth more than $US3 trillion.\n\nAbel will have to navigate the implications of AI for the post-Buffett investment environment if he is to continue Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s history of significant out-performance. Buffett could get away with a year or two of passivity or the odd poor investment; Abel won\u2019t be afforded that same level of shareholders\u2019 trust. There will be pressure on him to do something big with Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s cash \u2013 big enough to have an impact on the group\u2019s returns \u2013 and there won\u2019t be tolerance for any mistakes when he does. In many respects, Buffett has handed his successor a poisoned chalice. No-one could deliver the Buffett package of extraordinary returns wrapped around his unique style and charisma \u2013 a personality cult that developed over decades \u2013 in an investing environment so different, and vastly more competitive, than when Buffett was mopping up hard assets at discounts to their book values, let alone their market values. Abel may have to chart a new and different course for Berkshire Hathaway, as anyone who succeeded the man who created one of the world\u2019s biggest and most influential investment firms would have had to do.",

Chinese buyers have dimmed on the brand, with its sales plunging 42 per cent in the first quarter this year, accelerating a precipitous slide throughout 2024, as the country\u2019s economic downturn bites into the wallets of the luxury-loving classes. But the real culprit is the relentless march of China\u2019s electric vehicle industry, which, having conquered domestic demand for cheap, accessible cars, is making inroads into the high-end market where European brands once seemed unassailable. Porsche has fallen on tough times in China. Credit: Sanghee Liu As hundreds of thousands of people traversed the sprawling, multi-level display floors showcasing more than 70 Chinese and international automotive brands at the fortnight-long Shanghai expo, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence of the challenges facing the legacy manufacturers. When it comes to price, technological prowess, and even aesthetics, buyers are increasingly turning to homegrown Chinese brands. Next door to Porsche on the showroom floor was the Huawei-backed AITO brand, one of the Chinese companies eating the lunch of the foreign automakers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe would have considered a Porsche if we continued with an internal combustion engine, but it doesn\u2019t actually make much sense. We want to experience more high-tech things,\u201d Song Junqun, 41, a worker in the semiconductor industry, said. Song and his wife, Yu Qiong, were eyeing off the AITO\u2019s M9 luxury SUV, which pulled a sizeable crowd as people clambered into the leather-clad interior to test the software embedded across multiple flat-screens. Huawei-backed AITO is one of the Chinese companies eating the lunch of the foreign auto makers.

But in China, where it is the leading smartphone company, its pivot into the auto sector is paying off as customers seek out its cutting-edge smart driving systems. The M9 is billed as a direct rival to the Mercedes-Benz GLS, the car Song\u2019s family currently drives. But at about 500,000 yuan ($107,000), it\u2019s about half the cost.

Today, China is the world\u2019s biggest carmaker and exporter. Its booming EV industry is oversaturated with brands and models, sparking warnings from experts of a reckoning on the horizon.

In 2024, it overtook Tesla as the world\u2019s top EV seller, with sales of over 4.27 million fully electric and hybrid vehicles, more than double its rival\u2019s. Despite BYD dominance, more than 130 Chinese EV brands are competing for the nation\u2019s buyers. The auto expo, which alternates between Shanghai and Beijing, has become a glitzy testament to the cut-price showdown in the overcrowded sector.

BYD, Li Auto and the Seres Group (which produces the AITO brand) are among the few turning a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the furious competition is driving an innovation race that spans the incredible to the absurd.

Another spruiked its \u201cpet-mode\u201d customisation features. Under its luxury spin-off brand, Yangwang, BYD showcased its ultra-sleek U9 electric super-coupe \u2013 in red, of course. With wing-like doors and the ability to hit 100km/hr in under two seconds, it also has a \u201cleap mode\u201d designed to jump potholes and, for unexplained reasons, road spikes.

But it is also a little bit disconcerting because it does have a feel that there are too many of them. There\u2019s a bit of a bubble,\u201d Voortman, who visited the expo last month, says. Two foreign visitors at the Lynk & Co booth. Credit: Sanghee Liu AADA data shows there are about 60 car brands in Australia, more than a dozen of them Chinese, with at least six further Chinese brands expected to enter the market in the near future. Loading \u201cIn Australia, we are reaching a dangerous level of oversupply. We have more makes and models than most developed countries,\u201d Voortman says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very perilous time.\u201d While competition, most notably between BYD and Tesla, is driving down prices, the risk is that consumers and dealers are left high and dry when either legacy brands or new entrants quit the market, he says.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Smith has a major platform as one of the game\u2019s most marketable and popular players \u2013 his 361,000 followers leads all AFL players \u2013 but needs to decide how he wants to be perceived beyond his performance. Asked by ex-Cat Cameron Mooney on Saturday night about playing in front of 82,000 fans, Smith delivered a broadside at his former club, which beat Port Adelaide in front of fewer than 5000 fans in Ballarat. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, mate \u2013 [I\u2019m] not getting that at Ballarat,\u201d Smith told Fox Footy. This is Smith\u2019s third venture into the headlines this year for an action not involving kicking a football.\n\nThe first was somewhat admirable, even if it was a tad silly, when he flipped the bird at an Adelaide fan getting stuck into his captain Patrick Dangerfield. The other was on Easter Monday, when Smith decided it was a good idea \u2013 after a routine bump between the two as they crossed the boundary line \u2013 to bang the Sherrin into Hawk Jarman Impey\u2019s face with a swinging arm, which cost him a free kick and later a fine. Geelong skipper Patrick Dangerfield disappears down the race at Adelaide Oval with teammate Bailey Smith, who seconds earlier went head-to-head with a Crows fan. Credit: AFL Photos Smith offered another middle-finger salute to the Hawthorn faithful in the same game. Geelong coach Chris Scott dismissed suggestions after the Easter Monday contest that he might need to rein Smith in. \u201cTouching a footy on someone\u2019s face \u2013 I hope he\u2019s OK \u2013 but I think it\u2019s so minor, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much,\u201d Scott said.\n\nBailey Smith suggests his former captain took the bait. Credit: Instagram \u201cWe don\u2019t condone it, but we\u2019re much more interested in a pattern [of behaviour] \u2026 I don\u2019t buy into [fan interactions] too much, but my suggestion is that the crowd loved it, the AFL loved it, and I reckon Bailey loves it as well. If the suggestion is that we should try to make him boring and vanilla, then we\u2019ll rail against that.\u201d Is Smith\u2019s behaviour a pattern yet? As we know, players always have a longer leash when they are performing at a high level. Bulldogs skipper Marcus Bontempelli gently bit back at Smith\u2019s Ballarat comment with a \u201cflipping the bird\u201d reference, only for his ex-teammate to jump straight on Instagram to post three fishing rods while tagging The Salty Dog Cafe. None of this is a hanging offence, and we love players with personality, but Smith is straddling the line between entertainment and just being juvenile.\n\nIs history repeating? Friday night, Marvel Stadium\n\nSt Kilda defeated Fremantle by 61 points Justin Longmuir might want to look away. Longmuir\u2019s Dockers kicked one goal in the first half against St Kilda at Marvel Stadium on Friday night, on their way to a 61-point defeat in a 94-33 scoreline. Barely 10 months ago \u2013 in a separate battle between the west and east \u2013 Hawthorn pasted West Coast by the same 94-33 scoreline in a round 16 clash in Perth.\n\nAdam Simpson coached just one more game before he and the Eagles \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to part ways. The heat is now on Longmuir, who could not guide Fremantle to the finals in the past two seasons. The Dockers sit ninth with a 4-4 win-loss record this year after the Saints loss. Justin Longmuir and an inconsistent Fremantle are under the pump. Credit: AFL Photos \u201cThe first thing I look at after a performance like that, and any good leader should, is, \u2018What did I get wrong?\u2019,\u201d Longmuir said post-match. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here blaming the players. I\u2019ve got to look at my own performance this week, and, \u2018Am I contributing to us being an inconsistent team?\u2019. So, of course, I\u2019m going to question myself. You can\u2019t just sit here and say it\u2019s all on the players.\u201d Goldy looking oldy\n\nThursday night, Marvel Stadium\n\nEssendon defeated North Melbourne by three points Loading Ruckmen are enjoying a renaissance in 2025. Carlton\u2019s Tom De Koning has been mostly magnificent \u2013 although he was not at his best in a big loss to the Crows in Adelaide on Saturday \u2013 while Melbourne great Max Gawn\u2019s past three performances are unmatched and put him back in the All-Australian mix. North Melbourne\u2019s Tristan Xerri, Magpie Darcy Cameron and Hawthorn\u2019s Lloyd Meek are also enjoying strong campaigns, while Dockers Luke Jackson and Sean Darcy are arguably the best ruck one-two punch in the AFL.\n\nWestern Bulldog and 2023 All-Australian Tim English, St Kilda\u2019s Rowan Marshall, Swan Brodie Grundy, Gold Coast co-captain Jarrod Witts, Brisbane\u2019s Oscar McInerney and Tigers skipper Toby Nankervis are also more than capable of a match-winning turn. That brings us to Essendon and Adelaide, who both have decisions to make about their ruck stocks. Reilly O\u2019Brien is more solid citizen than world-beater, but rarely lets the Crows down and was the first ruckman this season to lower De Koning\u2019s colours, or at least dull his influence. Sam Draper is out for the rest of the season with an Achilles rupture. Credit: Fox Footy O\u2019Brien is an unrestricted free agent at season\u2019s end, but Adelaide are sniffing around Bomber Sam Draper, who is also an unrestricted free agent. Draper won\u2019t play again until 2026 after suffering an Achilles rupture last month.\n\nEssendon\u2019s No.2 big man, Nick Bryan, also needs to sign a new deal in the months ahead, but an ACL rupture also ended his season, meaning Todd Goldstein, who turns 37 in July, is suddenly carrying the load. Loading The evidence on Thursday night against Xerri and the Roos is that Goldstein and the Bombers are going to have a brutal time against the best ruckmen. Xerri dominated and almost single-handedly dragged North to an upset win from 26 points down. Both matches should have given Adelaide and Essendon food for thought. The Crows maybe need to appreciate O\u2019Brien a bit more, while the temptation for the Bombers to let Draper walk and potentially snaffle another first-round draft pick as compensation might not be worth the downside.\n\nBelated rewards Saturday afternoon, Adelaide Oval\n\nAdelaide defeated Carlton by 60 points Jobs were on the line in Adelaide\u2019s recruiting and list management team at the end of last season, and change was likely if the Crows failed again to play finals this year. Chief among the criticism \u2013 beyond the club not playing a final since the 2017 grand final \u2013 was a string of first-round draft choices who didn\u2019t work out, from Fischer McAsey to Ned McHenry and Jordan Gallucci. Fellow first-rounders Chayce Jones, Luke Pedlar and Brayden Cook are also stuck in the SANFL. Max Michalanney (right) and the Crows are on the rise. Credit: AFL Photos",

    "text": "As grocery prices continue to climb, amid a broader cost-of-living crisis , Australians are looking for any way to save.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it turns out that might mean re-entering the sometimes stigmatised territory of buying home brand alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest quarterly update from supermarket giant Coles found that one in three customers were buying more home brand products to save at the checkout.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what is a home brand product \u2014 and does the lower price come with a catch?\n\n\n\nWhat's the deal with home brand?\n\nHome brand groceries \u2014 or private labels \u2014 are items made specifically for supermarkets and sold under their branding.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeen at retailers like Woolworths, Coles and Aldi , these products typically aren't manufactured by the supermarkets themselves. Instead, they're contracted out to third-party producers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the exact same factory might produce a fancier brand of tinned tomatoes and a supermarket's home brand variety.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Supermarket secrets: The tactics used to get you to spend more\n\n\"That doesn't mean the product is always exactly the same as the 'branded' product; it just means it was made at the same factory,\" Sarah Megginson, media spokesperson at financial comparison site Finder, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In some cases, the product is indistinguishable from the brand name, and in other cases, it tastes or works completely differently,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhy are home brand products cheaper?\n\nThere are a few reasons why home brand products cost less than branded ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nMegginson points to reduced packaging costs, fewer or no margins for intermediaries in the supply chain, and sometimes lower ingredient or formulation costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the biggest factor? Minimal marketing spend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Brands not only invest huge dollars in brand development and marketing campaigns for their products out in the world, but they also spend a small fortune with Woolworths to secure 'shelf space' in the prized eye-level shelves or end of aisles,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Home brand products are obviously not investing in this \u2014 they're happily sitting on the bottom shelves, out of the way of their more expensive counterparts.\"\n\n\n\n\"They are almost always cheaper than brand names and when budgets get tight, they're a great option if they do the job on a taste \u2014 or in the case of cleaning products, a performance \u2014 basis,\" Megginson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKate Browne, head of research at Compare Club, says home brand quality in Australia is \"very good\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing you might miss is a range of options. A home brand pasta sauce might just have tomatoes in it, she says, while a branded version could include basil, garlic, or other flavours.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, price differences also come down to extras \u2014 like whether your tinned tomatoes have a ring-pull lid or not.\n\n\n\nDo home brand products hold up?\n\nAccording to CHOICE, the answer is yes \u2014 often better than you'd expect.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consumer advocacy group has tested a number of home brand products over the years and says they frequently outperform pricier alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've found this happens across a number of categories, including tea bags, coffee, ice-cream, dishwasher detergent, toilet paper, and more,\" a CHOICE expert told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, our most recent tea bag test found that Aldi's Just Organic Black Tea was the highest scoring overall out of 32 tea bag brands. At just 6 cents per bag, we found they were a cheaper and better-tasting option than brands like Lipton, Twinings, Tetley, and T2.\"\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News\n\nWhat's in it for supermarkets?\n\nFor supermarkets, home brand products can be more than a budget-friendly option for shoppers \u2014 they're also a profit booster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Supermarkets love home brands because they own those brands,\" Browne said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen a huge shift in the way our supermarkets in Australia retail. Ten or 12 years ago, there were a lot more name brands. Now we've seen a huge shift to more and more supermarket-owned brands, and that is purely for profit.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Are supermarkets being unfairly targeted for price gouging?\n\nBrowne explains that when supermarkets deal with name brands, they have to manage external retailers and suppliers, which can cost more. With home brands, they cut those ties \u2014 and keep more of the margins.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it can mean less choice for consumers, it often results in lower prices and more control for the retailers.\n\n\n\nCost of groceries biting into budgets\n\nAs cost of living remains front of mind for many Australians, our shops are now looking a little different.\n\n\n\n\n\nA January survey from CHOICE found 84 per cent of households are concerned about the cost of food and groceries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Due to rising costs, many people are switching to cheaper products to save money on their grocery bills,\" CHOICE said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA January Finder survey of 1,013 people found that 39 per cent are switching to cheaper brands due to financial pressure.\n\n\n\nMore Australians are looking to cut back on their grocery bills, with 39 per cent saying they're switching to cheaper brands. Source: SBS News Similarly, Compare Club research found that 80 per cent of Australians are experiencing high or extreme levels of bill stress, with half of them cutting back on essentials like food and fuel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of shift in behaviour. Concerningly, we're seeing people rely on buy-now-pay-later to buy groceries in some scenarios,\" Browne said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But we're also seeing people being a lot more agnostic around brands. People are looking for the cheapest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also says people are now shopping around at multiple stores before heading to the big supermarkets in a bid to save some cash. \"They're looking for the best possible deal and they're trying new brands.\"\n\n\n\nOnce considered a last resort, home brand products are now a regular feature in many households \u2014 and the stigma is fading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen a real big shift over the last couple of decades around home brands,\" Browne said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was a bit of a stigma back in the day, but now we've seen them become a real game changer in the market.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Managing the risk of global economic uncertainty is the government's first order of business, Treasurer Jim Chalmers says, after an early-morning briefing with the Treasury secretary following Labor's historic election victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers told the ABC's Insiders program on Sunday that he had spoken with Treasury boss Steven Kennedy at 6.45am and was briefed on the possible fallout for Australia amid strained US\u2013China relations, including financial market movements and what they might mean for the local economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe described this as the government's \"immediate focus\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that the direct impact on us from the [US] tariffs is manageable and relatively modest,\" Chalmers told Insiders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But there is a huge downside risk in the global economy. I think what's happening, particularly between the US and China, does cast a dark shadow over the global economy.\"\n\n\n\nIn March, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said there would be a $42 billion budget deficit next year. Source: AAP / Jono Searle In April, Australia's growth outlook was slashed by a major international body as US President Donald Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs sent markets into a tailspin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said uncertainty had reached unprecedented levels and downgraded Australia's economic growth projection for 2025 from 2.1 per cent in January to 1.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the agency's predictions unfold, about $13 billion would be shaved off Australia's economy.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE World leaders congratulate Anthony Albanese on election victory\n\nMarkets rebounded after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs impacting exporters in most countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government has also been working to secure a tariff exemption, like it did during Trump's first term.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Treasurer said the government was \"realistic\" about the potential consequences of Trump's tariffs on the global economy but also optimistic about how Australia could weather the storm, including while rolling out domestic policies such as renewable energy and housing.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The many ways Australia will change under Anthony Albanese's second term\n\nAnnouncing the federal budget earlier this year, Chalmers said there would be a $42 billion budget deficit next financial year and referred to global trade disruptions and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East amid \"storm clouds\" in the global economy .\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Albanese downplayed concerns Australia could face an economic downturn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our government has presided over growth in every quarter since we've been in office. Unlike a lot of the advanced economies around the world,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Australian Industry Group has congratulated Albanese and Labor on winning a second term but said Australian businesses face immense challenges in the coming months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the toughest time in a generation to be a business,\" the group said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Each day sees more global trade disruption, greater market intervention, the building of trade barriers and the risk of global conflict. As a trade-expressed economy, we will not be immune to the consequences of the rapidly changing global landscape.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his victory speech on Saturday evening, Albanese referred to global challenges but said his government would address these issues \"the Australian way\" by \"looking after each other while building for the future\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

And to serve these values, meet these challenges, seize these opportunities and to build that better and stronger future, Australians have chosen a majority-Labor government (crowd cheers).\"\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nAli France, the Labor candidate who unseated Coalition leader Peter Dutton from his seat of Dickson in Brisbane has thanked voters for their support.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disability advocate, former journalist and world champion para-athlete won the seat in her third attempt and says it couldn't have happened without the dedication of the volunteers and members of her team.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has vowed to be a dedicated MP for all voters in the electorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Finally, thank you to all those in Dickson who voted for change - and maybe voted for Labor for the very first time.

I know from my experience on the ground going to - I went to 27 booths yesterday during the day. And overwhelmingly the message I got voters was they really rejected the fear and smear campaigns. We had billboards and signs - and plastered stuff. And they really rejected that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholics from across the world have attended a candlelight procession and a rosary to mourn Pope Francis in St Peter's square.\n\n\n\n\n\nColombian Catholic, Jose Gomez, says that being in Rome helps him to feel close to Pope Francis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As Colombian people, we are really religious and really Catholic.

    "text": "US President Donald Trump posted a spoof picture of himself dressed as the pope on his Truth Social platform after joking that he would like to be the next Catholic pontiff.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is seen in what appears to be an AI-generated colour image, with his right index finger pointed toward the sky, wearing papal regalia, including white robes, a gold crucifix pendant and the mitre hat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after Trump joked to reporters this week that he would like to be the next pope, just days before cardinals are due to start the conclave to elect the successor to Pope Francis, who died on 21 April .\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked who he would like to succeed Pope Francis, Trump said: \"I'd like to be pope, that would be my number one choice.\"\n\n\n\nTrump went on to say that he did not have a preference but said there was a cardinal in New York who was \"very good\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the archbishop of New York, Timothy Dolan, a theological conservative who is fiercely opposed to abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York State Catholic Conference, which says it represents bishops of the state in working with the government, voiced sharp criticism of the picture.\n\n\n\n\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,\" it wrote in a post on X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to comment on the image during a briefing with journalists.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi wrote on X: \"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the global right enjoys being a clown. In the meantime, the American economy risks recession and the dollar loses value.\"\n\n\n\nTrump attended the funeral service of Pope Francis last week, his first foreign trip since returning to power.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 20 per cent of Americans declare themselves Catholic, and exit polls indicated in November that they voted around 60 per cent in favour of Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis had arguably been one of the most powerful moral voices on the world stage critical of Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Trump first ran for president in 2016, Francis was unsparing on Trump's signature promise to build a border wall to seal off Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis told reporters: \"Anyone, whoever he is, who only wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinals will gather on 7 May in a conclave in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope.\n\n\n\n",

Nikki To Herbs Taverne, a new negroni bar from Mucho Hospitality Group \u2013 the team behind Bar Planet and Cantina OK! \u2013 has opened on Clarence Street in the Sydney CBD. The small, 80-person bar is unlike anything else in the city, with red-hued, gold-tinged interiors influenced by \u201960s New York, a glittering disco ball and innovative twists on one of the world\u2019s most famous cocktails (traditionally made with gin, Campari and vermouth). The drinks menu focuses on quality over quantity, serving three signature negronis (a traffic light medley of red, gold and green) alongside a tight list of cocktails and shots devoted to the Italian cocktail\u2019s bittersweet backbone. 1 / 11 The signature green (herbal), yellow (tropical) and red (classic) negronis at Herbs Taverne Nikki To 2 / 11 New negroni bar Herbs Taverne has opened in Sydney.

Mucho has received widespread acclaim for its concept bars, which anchor their drinks lists around a singular cocktail or spirit. Bar Planet introduced a new generation of drinkers to the martini, while Cantina OK!, the mezcal-centered micro-bar two doors down from Herbs, featured on the World\u2019s 50 Best Bars list for three consecutive years, beginning in 2020.

We want our bars to be inclusive, and for people to feel comfortable to explore what\u2019s on offer, learn what they like \u2026 and maybe change what they drink forever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cred\u201d negroni is an accessible option for fans of the classic, made with gin, sweet vermouth and Campari. The green and gold varieties are underlined by bold, botanical and tropical liqueurs made with parsley, passionfruit and the roots of the blue flowering gentian plant. The green negroni is a tart, herbaceous addition. Nikki To Herbs has transformed an \u201cempty concrete box\u201d site into a warm space with chequered black carpet, comfortable table seating and a throwback soundtrack of twangy indie tunes from the mid-2000s. \u201cThat kind of music is quite nostalgic for us,\u201d says Tulley. \u201cWe\u2019re in our mid-30s now, and I feel like every bar we do is an expression of the stage we\u2019re at in life \u2026 we\u2019re growing up, and our bars are maturing along with us.\u201d But mature doesn\u2019t have to mean serious. Blackmore, who has become known for creating a signature popcorn flavour at Mucho\u2019s other venues (Bar Planet\u2019s salty-sweet curry popcorn is particularly popular), has taken the complimentary snack to another level at Herbs Taverne. Inspired by Chicago deep-dish pizzas, the popped kernels are tossed with cheese and drizzled with hot honey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really delicious,\u201d says Tulley.

    "text": "Not surprisingly, for more than two years, instead of using the torrents of cash his group has generated to buy expensive companies or shares Buffett has been building a stockpile of cash. Berkshire Hathaway now has a hoard of $US347.7 billion (about $540 billion). For Abel, how and when he deploys that cash will represent the major and reputation-defining challenge of his new role. Buffett\u2019s successor Greg Abel has been handed a poisoned chalice. Credit: Getty Abel is an operational guy, brought into Berkshire Hathaway when it acquired a stake in MidAmerican Energy in 1999. He built the energy business into a key pillar of the group\u2019s operating assets and now runs all Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s non-insurance operations, a portfolio of more than 180 operating companies that generated $US47.4 billion of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $US89.7 billion of first-quarter revenues. He\u2019s a manager, not an investor, with Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, the executives responsible for identifying targets for investment. Once he replaces Buffett, however, it is Abel who will have to make the big calls.\n\nBuffett has been a contrarian investor, often sitting on the markets\u2019 sidelines for considerable periods while waiting for opportunities \u2013 the \u201cstraw hats in winter,\u201d or counter-cyclical, approach that hardcore value investors pursue. Loading \u201cWe simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful,\u201d Buffett has said to explain his philosophy. In 2008, during the global financial crisis, that strategy was vindicated. Berkshire Hathaway stepped in during the worst of the crisis to buy cheap stakes in companies like Goldman Sachs, General Electric and Dow Chemical, driving very hard bargains in exchange for the calming influence its money and Buffett\u2019s reputation provided. Those sorts of opportunities don\u2019t, however, come that often.\n\nSince the crisis, Buffett has been relatively quiet, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s level of out-performance of the market has shrunk and its store of undeployed cash has soared, signalling that Buffett believes there isn\u2019t value in the market for either companies or shares in the current environment. His major play in recent years, unusually for a group largely focused on the US, has been the $US23.5 billion the group has invested in five of Japan\u2019s biggest trading houses. Abel\u2019s challenge will be to find value and the moment to use that cash on deals that are large enough to move the dial in what is now a $US1.2 trillion conglomerate. The big long-term holdings within Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment portfolio are companies like Amex, Coca-Cola, Bank of America and Apple. Credit: Bloomberg If Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies \u2013 his tariffs \u2013 were to push the US economy into recession, which is possible, that moment might arise. There is a lot of leverage in the US system. During the near meltdown in the US bond market earlier this year after Trump made his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement of reciprocal tariffs, hedge funds were scrambling to exit leveraged trades and the market for leveraged loans froze.\n\nThere are a lot of highly-leveraged hedge funds and private equity firms out there that would be stressed if economic conditions deteriorated markedly, or interest rates were to rise \u2013 or both, if Trump induces, as some fear, a stagflationary recession. \u2018We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.\u2019 Warren Buffett Buffett seems confident that those sorts of distressed asset sales will eventuate. \u201cWe will be bombarded with offerings that we\u2019ll be glad we had the cash for,\u201d he said at the weekend. That could release a lot of the kinds of hard assets that private equity targets and Buffett has always liked: companies with good management, strong franchises, protective \u201cmoats\u201d and solid cashflows and earnings.\n\nThe big long-term holdings within Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment portfolio are companies like Amex, Coca-Cola, Bank of America and, while he was late to that party, Apple, but the core portfolio of operating companies is centred on insurance, utilities and energy, railroads, and a collection of manufacturers and retailers. Whether those sorts of companies that have generally performed well in the past 60 years will generate similar performance in future is an open question. Artificial intelligence is expected to transform companies and industries in ways that are difficult to predict. For decades an increasing number of Buffett acolytes have made the pilgrimage to Omaha, Nebraska, to hear pearls of investing wisdom from the \u201cSage of Omaha\u201d. Credit: AP Buffett\u2019s philosophy was to avoid companies and technologies he didn\u2019t understand, so he didn\u2019t invest in companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and only started investing in Apple \u2013 the star of the portfolio \u2013 in early 2016, nine years after Steve Jobs launched the first iPhone and transformed a company now worth more than $US3 trillion.\n\nAbel will have to navigate the implications of AI for the post-Buffett investment environment if he is to continue Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s history of significant out-performance. Buffett could get away with a year or two of passivity or the odd poor investment; Abel won\u2019t be afforded that same level of shareholders\u2019 trust. There will be pressure on him to do something big with Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s cash \u2013 big enough to have an impact on the group\u2019s returns \u2013 and there won\u2019t be tolerance for any mistakes when he does. In many respects, Buffett has handed his successor a poisoned chalice. No-one could deliver the Buffett package of extraordinary returns wrapped around his unique style and charisma \u2013 a personality cult that developed over decades \u2013 in an investing environment so different, and vastly more competitive, than when Buffett was mopping up hard assets at discounts to their book values, let alone their market values. Abel may have to chart a new and different course for Berkshire Hathaway, as anyone who succeeded the man who created one of the world\u2019s biggest and most influential investment firms would have had to do.",

Chinese buyers have dimmed on the brand, with its sales plunging 42 per cent in the first quarter this year, accelerating a precipitous slide throughout 2024, as the country\u2019s economic downturn bites into the wallets of the luxury-loving classes. But the real culprit is the relentless march of China\u2019s electric vehicle industry, which, having conquered domestic demand for cheap, accessible cars, is making inroads into the high-end market where European brands once seemed unassailable. Porsche has fallen on tough times in China. Credit: Sanghee Liu As hundreds of thousands of people traversed the sprawling, multi-level display floors showcasing more than 70 Chinese and international automotive brands at the fortnight-long Shanghai expo, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence of the challenges facing the legacy manufacturers. When it comes to price, technological prowess, and even aesthetics, buyers are increasingly turning to homegrown Chinese brands. Next door to Porsche on the showroom floor was the Huawei-backed AITO brand, one of the Chinese companies eating the lunch of the foreign automakers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe would have considered a Porsche if we continued with an internal combustion engine, but it doesn\u2019t actually make much sense. We want to experience more high-tech things,\u201d Song Junqun, 41, a worker in the semiconductor industry, said. Song and his wife, Yu Qiong, were eyeing off the AITO\u2019s M9 luxury SUV, which pulled a sizeable crowd as people clambered into the leather-clad interior to test the software embedded across multiple flat-screens. Huawei-backed AITO is one of the Chinese companies eating the lunch of the foreign auto makers. Credit: Sanghee Liu Huawei is viewed with suspicion in the West, particularly in Australia, where it was banned from the 5G network rollout. But in China, where it is the leading smartphone company, its pivot into the auto sector is paying off as customers seek out its cutting-edge smart driving systems. The M9 is billed as a direct rival to the Mercedes-Benz GLS, the car Song\u2019s family currently drives. But at about 500,000 yuan ($107,000), it\u2019s about half the cost. They considered Mercedes\u2019 latest EV models, and quickly passed them over. A worker brushes off the dust on a Huawei Maextro S800, China\u2019s answer to Maybach.

Today, China is the world\u2019s biggest carmaker and exporter. Its booming EV industry is oversaturated with brands and models, sparking warnings from experts of a reckoning on the horizon.

Credit: Sanghee Liu BYD, which made its first fully electric car in 2009, is now China\u2019s best-selling car brand. In 2024, it overtook Tesla as the world\u2019s top EV seller, with sales of over 4.27 million fully electric and hybrid vehicles, more than double its rival\u2019s. Despite BYD dominance, more than 130 Chinese EV brands are competing for the nation\u2019s buyers. The auto expo, which alternates between Shanghai and Beijing, has become a glitzy testament to the cut-price showdown in the overcrowded sector. At the BYD showroom, sales reps demonstrated its five-minute fast-charging technology.

BYD, Li Auto and the Seres Group (which produces the AITO brand) are among the few turning a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the furious competition is driving an innovation race that spans the incredible to the absurd.

With wing-like doors and the ability to hit 100km/hr in under two seconds, it also has a \u201cleap mode\u201d designed to jump potholes and, for unexplained reasons, road spikes.

But it is also a little bit disconcerting because it does have a feel that there are too many of them. There\u2019s a bit of a bubble,\u201d Voortman, who visited the expo last month, says. Two foreign visitors at the Lynk & Co booth. Credit: Sanghee Liu AADA data shows there are about 60 car brands in Australia, more than a dozen of them Chinese, with at least six further Chinese brands expected to enter the market in the near future. Loading \u201cIn Australia, we are reaching a dangerous level of oversupply. We have more makes and models than most developed countries,\u201d Voortman says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very perilous time.\u201d While competition, most notably between BYD and Tesla, is driving down prices, the risk is that consumers and dealers are left high and dry when either legacy brands or new entrants quit the market, he says.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Smith has a major platform as one of the game\u2019s most marketable and popular players \u2013 his 361,000 followers leads all AFL players \u2013 but needs to decide how he wants to be perceived beyond his performance. Asked by ex-Cat Cameron Mooney on Saturday night about playing in front of 82,000 fans, Smith delivered a broadside at his former club, which beat Port Adelaide in front of fewer than 5000 fans in Ballarat. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, mate \u2013 [I\u2019m] not getting that at Ballarat,\u201d Smith told Fox Footy. This is Smith\u2019s third venture into the headlines this year for an action not involving kicking a football.\n\nThe first was somewhat admirable, even if it was a tad silly, when he flipped the bird at an Adelaide fan getting stuck into his captain Patrick Dangerfield. The other was on Easter Monday, when Smith decided it was a good idea \u2013 after a routine bump between the two as they crossed the boundary line \u2013 to bang the Sherrin into Hawk Jarman Impey\u2019s face with a swinging arm, which cost him a free kick and later a fine. Geelong skipper Patrick Dangerfield disappears down the race at Adelaide Oval with teammate Bailey Smith, who seconds earlier went head-to-head with a Crows fan. Credit: AFL Photos Smith offered another middle-finger salute to the Hawthorn faithful in the same game. Geelong coach Chris Scott dismissed suggestions after the Easter Monday contest that he might need to rein Smith in. \u201cTouching a footy on someone\u2019s face \u2013 I hope he\u2019s OK \u2013 but I think it\u2019s so minor, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much,\u201d Scott said.\n\nBailey Smith suggests his former captain took the bait. Credit: Instagram \u201cWe don\u2019t condone it, but we\u2019re much more interested in a pattern [of behaviour] \u2026 I don\u2019t buy into [fan interactions] too much, but my suggestion is that the crowd loved it, the AFL loved it, and I reckon Bailey loves it as well. If the suggestion is that we should try to make him boring and vanilla, then we\u2019ll rail against that.\u201d Is Smith\u2019s behaviour a pattern yet? As we know, players always have a longer leash when they are performing at a high level. Bulldogs skipper Marcus Bontempelli gently bit back at Smith\u2019s Ballarat comment with a \u201cflipping the bird\u201d reference, only for his ex-teammate to jump straight on Instagram to post three fishing rods while tagging The Salty Dog Cafe. None of this is a hanging offence, and we love players with personality, but Smith is straddling the line between entertainment and just being juvenile.\n\nIs history repeating? Friday night, Marvel Stadium\n\nSt Kilda defeated Fremantle by 61 points Justin Longmuir might want to look away. Longmuir\u2019s Dockers kicked one goal in the first half against St Kilda at Marvel Stadium on Friday night, on their way to a 61-point defeat in a 94-33 scoreline. Barely 10 months ago \u2013 in a separate battle between the west and east \u2013 Hawthorn pasted West Coast by the same 94-33 scoreline in a round 16 clash in Perth.\n\nAdam Simpson coached just one more game before he and the Eagles \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to part ways. The heat is now on Longmuir, who could not guide Fremantle to the finals in the past two seasons. The Dockers sit ninth with a 4-4 win-loss record this year after the Saints loss. Justin Longmuir and an inconsistent Fremantle are under the pump. Credit: AFL Photos \u201cThe first thing I look at after a performance like that, and any good leader should, is, \u2018What did I get wrong?\u2019,\u201d Longmuir said post-match. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here blaming the players. I\u2019ve got to look at my own performance this week, and, \u2018Am I contributing to us being an inconsistent team?\u2019. So, of course, I\u2019m going to question myself. You can\u2019t just sit here and say it\u2019s all on the players.\u201d Goldy looking oldy\n\nThursday night, Marvel Stadium\n\nEssendon defeated North Melbourne by three points Loading Ruckmen are enjoying a renaissance in 2025. Carlton\u2019s Tom De Koning has been mostly magnificent \u2013 although he was not at his best in a big loss to the Crows in Adelaide on Saturday \u2013 while Melbourne great Max Gawn\u2019s past three performances are unmatched and put him back in the All-Australian mix. North Melbourne\u2019s Tristan Xerri, Magpie Darcy Cameron and Hawthorn\u2019s Lloyd Meek are also enjoying strong campaigns, while Dockers Luke Jackson and Sean Darcy are arguably the best ruck one-two punch in the AFL.\n\nWestern Bulldog and 2023 All-Australian Tim English, St Kilda\u2019s Rowan Marshall, Swan Brodie Grundy, Gold Coast co-captain Jarrod Witts, Brisbane\u2019s Oscar McInerney and Tigers skipper Toby Nankervis are also more than capable of a match-winning turn. That brings us to Essendon and Adelaide, who both have decisions to make about their ruck stocks. Reilly O\u2019Brien is more solid citizen than world-beater, but rarely lets the Crows down and was the first ruckman this season to lower De Koning\u2019s colours, or at least dull his influence. Sam Draper is out for the rest of the season with an Achilles rupture. Credit: Fox Footy O\u2019Brien is an unrestricted free agent at season\u2019s end, but Adelaide are sniffing around Bomber Sam Draper, who is also an unrestricted free agent. Draper won\u2019t play again until 2026 after suffering an Achilles rupture last month.\n\nEssendon\u2019s No.2 big man, Nick Bryan, also needs to sign a new deal in the months ahead, but an ACL rupture also ended his season, meaning Todd Goldstein, who turns 37 in July, is suddenly carrying the load. Loading The evidence on Thursday night against Xerri and the Roos is that Goldstein and the Bombers are going to have a brutal time against the best ruckmen. Xerri dominated and almost single-handedly dragged North to an upset win from 26 points down. Both matches should have given Adelaide and Essendon food for thought. The Crows maybe need to appreciate O\u2019Brien a bit more, while the temptation for the Bombers to let Draper walk and potentially snaffle another first-round draft pick as compensation might not be worth the downside.\n\nBelated rewards Saturday afternoon, Adelaide Oval\n\nAdelaide defeated Carlton by 60 points Jobs were on the line in Adelaide\u2019s recruiting and list management team at the end of last season, and change was likely if the Crows failed again to play finals this year. Chief among the criticism \u2013 beyond the club not playing a final since the 2017 grand final \u2013 was a string of first-round draft choices who didn\u2019t work out, from Fischer McAsey to Ned McHenry and Jordan Gallucci. Fellow first-rounders Chayce Jones, Luke Pedlar and Brayden Cook are also stuck in the SANFL. Max Michalanney (right) and the Crows are on the rise. Credit: AFL Photos",

Source: Getty/Queensland Govt\n\nAs yet another Australian council eyes banning dogs from beaches over environmental concerns, residents are ramping up their efforts to conserve what they say is an important recreational hub.\n\nOn the Sunshine Coast, locals are campaigning to save the off-leash dog beach at Stumers Creek in Coolum Beach, which is under threat as part of the council\u2019s Draft Dog Exercise Area Regional Plan.\n\nThe Save Stumers Creek Off Leash Dog Beach Committee has rallied strong public support, submitting more than 6000 signatures across online and paper petitions. They argue that the one kilometre stretch of beach, from access points 67 to 72, is an important social and recreational space where people and pets can \"decompress\", exercise, and unwind.\n\nBut council said it has a responsibility to consider the environmental toll animals take on beaches in the LGA. Speaking to Yahoo, a spokesperson said community feedback is currently being reviewed.\n\nLocals say the spot is beloved by the community, but council has said it must factor in environmental concerns.

Across Australia, councils regularly face tension between protecting the environment, accommodating pet owners, and ensuring public safety.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn NSW, last year, Shoalhaven City Council approved a proposal to permanently reduce the off-leash area at Narrawallee Beach in Mollymook, sparking backlash from local dog owners who felt the change was driven by pressure from beachfront property owners.\n\nFollowing a two-year trial, the City of Greater Geelong in Victoria implemented a permanent ban on dogs at Ocean Grove Beach in 2022, despite mixed feedback from the community.\n\nIn 2022, the Central Coast council in NSW proposed excluding dogs from all sand dunes and patrolled beaches, and restricting access to off-leash areas at popular beaches, citing concerns over non-compliance and community division.\n\nBut as urban populations grow and more people welcome dogs into their homes, demand for off-leash areas has surged, especially on beaches where dogs can roam freely and socialise. At the same time, concerns over wildlife protection, erosion, and the comfort of non-dog beachgoers have led many local governments to review or reduce off-leash zones.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
