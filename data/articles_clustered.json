    "text": "Christmas couldn't come fast enough for the Australian bicycle industry, which has been buffeted by a post-pandemic slump.\n\nBike sales ballooned during the COVID-19 health emergency , with cycling one of the activities permitted during lockdowns.\n\nResearch by industry analysts IBISWorld shows bikes were then flying off the racks as Australians embraced the activity, spurring a jump in profits from 2020 to 2022.\n\nCycling remains popular in Australia, but the bike industry has recorded a slump in sales since the end of the pandemic. (Lydia Lynch)\n\nStock levels across Australia were soon strained and as the virus led to lockdowns and factory shutdowns in the key manufacturing hubs of China and Taiwan , they became exhausted.\ufeff\n\nBut then the brakes came on as the global economy kickstarted post-pandemic, with cost-of-living pressures making new bicycle purchases a low priority for households.\n\nOne bright spot has been continuing high demand for parts, accessories and repair services.\n\nBicycle Industries Australia chief executive Peter Bourke said retailers, manufacturers and importers were counting on \ufeffthe festive season this year.\n\n\"Christmas and the summer months have traditionally been our strongest periods ... the wrapped bicycle under the Christmas tree is still a popular present,\" he said.\n\nDemand for bicycles in Australia and other countries boomed during the pandemic but then quickly fell off. (AP)\n\nTraditional bike shops continue to hold advantages over online retailers, including expert fittings, personalised advice and a skilled repair service, but they face a shifting market. \ufeff\n\nOne example, highlighted by the IBISWorld research released in 2025, was Pedal Group's 99 Bikes chain of stores across Australia.\n\nThe company expanded rapidly, increasing its number of physical stores to boost its market share.\n\nBut since the close of the pandemic, slumping demand caused the company to deal with oversupply issues, hampering its expansion.\n\nAnd Australian cycle companies are not alone in facing a post-COVID sales slump.\n\nRemember Peloton? \ufeffThe sports company turned out millions of exercise bikes and treadmills fitted with smart technology, fuelled by demand from fitness enthusiasts who were confined to home.\n\nSales of Peloton fitness bikes boomed during the pandemic, but then fell off after lockdowns lifted. (Supplied)\n\nSales boomed during lockdowns, but Peloton's fortunes began to fade as vaccinations increased, gyms reopened and rivals offered competitive products.\n\nOnce the darling of the US stock market during COVID, by February 2022, its share price had collapsed and a painful company restructure followed, including shedding 2800 workers.\n\nThe rising popularity of e-bikes is also another challenge to sales of conventional, or analogue, bicycles.\n\n\ufeffThe technology is expanding the market by appealing to a wider range of consumers than conventional, or analogue, bikes, requiring less pedalling and easier hill-climbing.\n\nMany bike shops are now stocking e-bikes, but they've been competing with sales from private individuals and online suppliers, often spruiking powerful and illegally altered machines.\n\nE-bikes have provided both a threat and opportunity for conventional bike sales. (Jorens Seins/iStock)\n\nAustralian import regulations controls on e-bikes were relaxed in 2021, leading to a flood of such e-bikes capable of travelling at more than 50km/h.\n\nBut in December 2025, after a spate of deaths and serious injuries of e-bike riders, federal and state authorities agreed to reinstate a key import standard to define legal e-bikes.\n\nThis would include the motor cutting out at a maximum assisted speed of 25km/h. \ufeff\n\nLooking ahead, the hope is a safer and better-regulated market will create a level playing field for established bike dealers.\n\nBourke says the industry is adapting to the heady changes, but the traditional local bicycle store selling everything, from children's bikes with trainer wheels, to mountain bikes, commuter machines and racing cycles is probably on its way out.",

England are 3-0 down going into the Boxing Day Test and cannot win the series.\n\nThe England and Cricket Board (ECB) has released a statement saying it is looking into the video, yet to be verified, that has been widely circulated.\n\nThe video appears to have been filmed before last week's Adelaide Test, with a reference to England being down 2-0 in the series.\n\nIt shows a man, identified in the video as Duckett, who is slurring his words and does not know the directions to where he is staying. The location is unclear.\n\nThe video was posted on Tuesday night. Earlier in the day, Key had spoken to English journalists and said the team's drinking habits would be investigated following reports a mid-Ashes beach break resembled a \"stag do\".\n\nThe squad visited Noosa between the second and third Tests.\n\nBen Duckett has only scored 97 runs in six Test innings this tour, averaging 16.16 with a top score of 29. (Getty Images: Gareth Copley)\n\nKey, who did not join the group in Noosa, has said he would not be happy if he found evidence of over-indulging.\n\n\"Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for an international cricket team is not something that I'd expect to see at any stage and it would be a fault not to look into what happened there,\" Key said.\n\n\"From everything that I've heard so far, they actually were pretty well behaved. Very well behaved.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe break on the Queensland coast had been long planned and designed to help players relax and unwind during an intense Ashes tour. A host of TV crews, photographers and reporters followed them to the resort.\n\n\"I have no issue with the Noosa trip if it was to get away and just throw your phone away, down tools, go on the beach, all of that stuff,\" Key said.\n\n\"If it goes into where they're drinking lots and it's a stag do, all of that type of stuff, that's completely unacceptable.\"\n\nIn response to the video posted on Tuesday night, an ECB spokesperson said: \"We are aware of content circulating on social media.\n\n\"We have high expectations for behaviour, accepting that players are often under intense levels of scrutiny, with established processes that we follow when conduct falls below expectations. We also support players that need assistance.\n\n\"We will not comment further at this stage while we establish the facts.\"\n\nEngland was training at the MCG on Wednesday, with captain Ben Stokes to hold a media conference in the afternoon.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Kate Winslet is hoping you will spend Christmas with her. Well, that is, at least on screen.\n\nWhile her 2006 whimsical comedy romance The Holiday, which co-starred Cameron Diaz, remains a seasonal favourite, Winslet's new family Christmas-themed film Goodbye June is a much more personal project. It's the Oscar-winning actor's directorial debut.\n\nIt's also a family affair, as her 21-year-old son, Joe Anders (along with ex-husband and director Sam Mendes) wrote the screenplay.\n\nDirecting wasn't initially on the agenda but Winslet was so touched by her son's novice script, she felt she had no choice.\n\nAnders wrote it as an assignment for a screenwriting course, loosely based on the loss of his maternal grandmother to ovarian cancer in 2017 when he was 13.\n\n\"I was so overwhelmed by just how funny, real, touching and cathartic it was,\" Winslet says.\n\n\"I had a very strong emotional reaction to it. The scenario of an entire family coming together, whilst it's a fictional story, was very reminiscent of exactly what happened when my own mother passed away. I just felt I had to direct it.\"\n\nA natural director\n\nWinslet is in Los Angeles to screen and promote the film to press.\n\nWhen we meet she's impeccably dressed in a black pants suit and crisp white blouse. She has a sweet but firm confidence. She seems to be relishing her new role as director.\n\nKate Winslet has worked with Hollywood heavyweights, but says the time for her to step into the role of director has not been right until now. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\n\"I got the film in on time and below budget. I hit all the marks,\" Winslet says, proudly.\n\nWinslet has been directed by some of the best, including her first feature film in 1994, Peter Jackson's eerie Heavenly Creatures.\n\nShe has also worked with Ang Lee in his poetic take on Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, James Cameron in her iconic role in Titanic, acclaimed Australian director Jocelyn Moorhouse for The Dressmaker, and British director Stephan Daldry for her Oscar-winning performance in The Reader.\n\n\"I'm a very technical actor and over the years I've had many directors tell me I think like a director; that I should start directing,\" she says.\n\n\"But I was raising a family and so there just simply wouldn't have been the space to be able to make that level of a commitment.\n\n\" But I am thrilled to now be in my 50th year and finally be able to direct. \"\n\nOn scoring Helen Mirren\n\nGoodbye June is focused firmly on family and the memories, conflicts, joys and regrets that can either tear a family apart over the years, but can also bond them.\n\nHelen Mirren plays the terminally ill matriarch, June.\n\nGoodbye June features a stellar cast including Johnny Flynn and Helen Mirren. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nTimothy Spall is her stoic husband and their four children are played by Andrea Riseborough, Toni Collette, Johnny Flynn and Winslet.\n\nThe dysfunctional siblings, who have barely connected as adults, are forced to gather days before Christmas by the hospital bed of their still-feisty mother. With a mix of humour and heart they work through old wounds to unite as a family.\n\nCasting Mirren in the role was quite a coup for Winslet.\n\n\"She told me she had two rules: to never play anyone who had dementia or anyone who's dying of cancer,\" Winslet explains.\n\n\"But she promised to read the script. She came back and said: 'I'll break my rule. I will do it for you'.\n\n\"I was really touched by her support.\"\n\nThe ties that bind\n\nWinslet wanted to create a welcoming and warm filming experience for her seasoned actors.\n\n\"I've always dreamt of being able to rehearse in my own kitchen, so I could cook and feed everyone and have it feel like a family just by accident,\" she says. \"And that was what we were able to do.\"\n\nOn set (much of it was filmed at Ravenscourt Park Hospital, a derelict 1920s hospital in London) Winslet took away any distractions including intruding boom mics to make the acting experience more intimate.\n\nKate WInslet said she wanted to give the cast space to lean into their characters rather than micromanaging them. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\n\"I wanted to offer them a working experience and on-set environment that was different,\" she said.\n\n\"When you are faced with the likes of Helen Mirren and Timothy Spall, it would have been ridiculous for me to have thought I could say something clever.\n\n\"I know myself when directors try and throw you by shocking you with a piece of direction they think you may never have heard before. The reality is we've heard it all before and actually we just want to be given the space.\"\n\nBut many times, Winslet found it difficult to hold back her tears.\n\n\"Those quiet conversations between my own mother and father in those final weeks of my mother's life, of course, I wasn't there for,\" she says. \"So, watching this fictional family performing some of those very quiet scenes that happen in the final quarter of the story, I did find that very hard.\n\n\"I had to really just direct them very tenderly through my tears, as I sort of quietly hovered in the corner of the room.\n\n\"It mattered so much to make the most of this experience and to give the audiences a film that hopefully not only resonated with them, but created conversation and maybe offered them a space in which maybe they can have conversations with their loved ones, with whom we often have some of our most complicated relationships in our lifetimes.\"\n\nGoodbye June is streaming on Netflix.",

    "text": "Green, cooked, peeled or frozen \u2014 how you buy your prawns may say more about you than you realise.\n\nResearch by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) has found younger generations are increasingly opting for pre-peeled prawns.\n\nIt's a trend seafood retailers have noticed as Australians flock into stores ahead of Christmas.\n\nOverall, 56 per cent of Aussies prefer a peeled prawn, with the number rising to 66 per cent for gen Z and 63 per cent of millennials.\n\nAround half of Aussie consumers prefer Australian caught prawns, a figure that rises to 60 per cent among baby boomers. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nWhereas baby boomers are attempting to keep Christmas traditions alive and prefer buying whole prawns a majority of the time.\n\nMSC senior fisheries standards manager Adrian Gutteridge said the difference could likely be attributed to young families trying to save some time and hassle.\n\n\"Contrary to that idea that the cost-of-living crisis is making people choose cheaper options, it's actually more expensive to buy pre-peeled prawns,\" Dr Gutteridge said.\n\n\"That shows that the convenience of not having to deal with shells and heads once you get home is probably more factoring into that purchasing.\"\n\nKeiran Hein says the research is in line with what she has observed in store. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nSeafood store workers' observations have backed up the research.\n\nKeiran Hein, who works at Best Oceania Seafood in Mount Gambier, said she had a different word for why young consumers were opting for pre-peeled.\n\n\"Thirties and under are probably a bit on the lazier side; they will buy them pre-cooked and unshelled,\" she said.\n\n\"People my age, 50 and up, will buy the whole prawns and peel them themselves.\"\n\nIndustry pushes for focus on sustainability\n\nIt is not just the type of prawns where generations differ, with more gen Z and millennials checking their seafood is sustainably sourced compared to gen X and baby boomers.\n\nAccording to MSC research over half of Australians will be choosing frozen over fresh prawns this week. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"Only about 16 per cent are actually bringing sustainability into their purchasing sphere,\" Dr Gutteridge said.\n\n\"We'd love to see that get higher because at the moment there's about two-thirds of wild-caught prawns in Australia that carry the MSC blue fish tick labels, so it's never been easier to buy sustainably [caught] prawns.\n\n\"It's guaranteeing you that the fishery has gone through a really rigorous process to demonstrate sustainability.\"\n\nMeghan Petherick says businesses are fortunate to not be impacted by the South Australian algal bloom this Christmas. (Supplied: Meghan Petherick)\n\nMeanwhile, the Tapley family has been prawn fishing on the Spencer Gulf for generations, selling their seafood themselves at The Prawn Store in Port Lincoln.\n\nStore manager Meghan Petherick (nee Tapley) had also noticed changing trends in consumer habits.\n\n\"The shift that I have noticed is that the younger generation is buying what we call a green prawn \u2014 so a raw prawn versus your traditional cooked prawn,\" she said.\n\nWhile consumers may be shifting away from whole prawns, six in 10 Australians say peeling prawns brings back Christmas memories. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"It's a more versatile product ... there are more ways to get creative in the kitchen, so that is the shift that I've seen versus your boiled prawn.\"\n\nCatching millions of prawns\n\nHowever you buy them, prawns continue to be a firm favourite at Christmas, with Australians expected to consume an estimated 18.5 million kilograms this week, according to MSC.\n\nGetting all those prawns ready for consumers is no easy task, with fishers working around the clock to be Christmas-ready.\n\n76 per cent of Western Australians are willing to pay extra for pre-peeled prawns, well above the national average of 60 per cent. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"Numbers were fantastic this year, which has been really good and encouraging,\" Ms Petherick said.\n\n\"The lead-up to Christmas has been chaos in a good way, and it's been really good to have the support of locals, especially at this time with everything that is going on with the algal bloom.\"\n\nDespite being around them all year, there will still be prawns on the Tapley/Petherick table this Christmas.\n\nConsumers who go for green prawns usually have a recipe planned. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"I'm a greenie all the way because you can do so much more with it, and just cooking your own product is really rewarding as well,\" Ms Petherick said.\n\n\"But I am happy to also peel my own prawn.\"",

(Supplied)\n\n\"I think in Australia, there is a missed opportunity for bringing more of the younger generation in and spreading the awareness.\"\n\nAustralia has one of the lowest comparable donor pools in the world, according to Kate Levy from Stem Cell Donors Australia.\n\n\"Around 80 per cent of stem cell transplants in Australia actually come from international donors, that's because we don't have enough registered donors here in Australia,\" she said.\n\n\" So we are relying on volunteers, international donors, they are literally saving the lives of Australian patients. \"\n\nMs Levy said Australia could learn a lot from American registries offered through higher education.\n\nLife-saving stem cells hard to come by amid donor shortage Rowan Tong-Law, 18, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia last year and has been searching for a full stem cell donor match.\n\n\"I would love to see programs in every university \u2026 where we are recruiting donors through the universities because young donors are better,\" she said.\n\nCheek swabs as alternative to blood samples\n\nMs Levy also called for high schools to make students aware of how easy it had become for students to register as donors.\n\nSix years ago, the only way to recruit donors onto the registry was by collecting blood samples through a specific agency.\n\nNow it can be done via a simple cheek swab at Stem Cell Donors Australia.\n\nIn most cases, a stem cell donation will do the trick.\n\nCassidy (left) needed a week's recovery time after donating bone marrow for Gennaro.

(ABC News: Lily Nothling)\n\nMs Giese said for the rest of the year, volunteering roles were much more challenging to fill.\n\n\"With the decline of formal volunteering, a lot of organisations who historically have had really strong volunteering bases and indeed waiting lists, are no longer experiencing that,\" she said.\n\nShe said time and costs were the biggest barriers.\n\n\"People are out of pocket about $12 an hour for every hour that they volunteer, and that's a really difficult thing for people to sustain,\" Ms Giese said.\n\nVolunteeringACT CEO Jean Giese said Christmas Day was the one day bucking the broad trend of decreasing volunteering.

(ABC News: Lily Nothling)\n\nAt the same time, coordinator Colette Neumann said the service had experienced a decrease in volunteers and those able to pick up shifts at late notice.\n\n\"We can certainly use volunteers around Christmas time, but we definitely need volunteers throughout the whole year to help us run the program,\" she said.\n\n\" It does become difficult to fill shifts in the middle of winter when it's raining \u2014 it's not necessarily pleasant to be out in the cold. \"\n\nVinnies Night Patrol volunteer Mike Brennan with a Christmas hamper the charity gives out during the festive season. (ABC News: Lily Nothling)\n\nAs the charity prepares for another Christmas on the road, Ms Neumann has also encouraged people to consider spreading their generosity across the year.\n\n\"When everybody goes on holidays and you have leave from work so you've got the time, you want to feel good, so you offer to volunteer,\" Ms Neumann said.\n\n\"That's great, but definitely look into what it would mean to sustain it.\n\n\"That good feeling doesn't have to go away when Christmas does.\n\n\"You can keep doing it and feel good year-round.\"",

    "text": "Since the end of September, retail sales have flatlined, motor vehicle sales have fallen, consumer confidence has continued to slump, real wages growth has stalled and the household savings rate has declined. Loading It is conceivable, therefore, that the data doesn\u2019t capture what consumers have been complaining about, which is an affordability crisis. It\u2019s also may be the case that there are two Americas. In one, with the sharemarket and property markets buoyant, the wealthy households exposed to them \u2013 particularly those with any exposure to anything AI-related \u2013 are feeling very positive and spending freely. Real personal consumer spending rose 3.5 per cent in the quarter, accelerating from the June quarter\u2019s 2.8 per cent growth rate.\n\nIn the other, middle and lower-income households are under pressure, with no real wages growth to offset the higher prices being driven by Trump\u2019s tariffs. The Commerce Department\u2019s report revealed that there was zero growth in personal disposable incomes in the third quarter. The US Federal Reserve Board\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, rose 2.8 per cent in the third quarter, up from 2.1 per cent in the preceding three months. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose from 2.6 per cent to 2.9 per cent. The growing gap between the wealth and spending patterns of the wealthiest households and the less wealthy, who are struggling to absorb the price increases, has led to the US being described as a \u201cK-shaped\u201d economy: one where asset-rich high-income earners thrive while low-to-middle income households struggle with slow wage growth and inflation. An analogous picture has emerged in business investment. Small and medium-sized businesses are struggling as their input costs have been driven up, with the tariffs a significant influence, and gross private domestic investment was actually falling in the September quarter, by 0.3 per cent, despite big increases in investments in equipment and intellectual property.\n\nThe AI investment boom is, it seems, holding up business investment by itself, which isn\u2019t surprising given the sheer scale of the numbers involved. There are estimates that it accounts for as much as a half the economic growth this year. Loading The so-called \u201chyperscalers\u201d \u2013 Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle \u2013 will spend about $US400 billion ($600 billion) this year and more than $US500 billion next year. By 2030, assuming the boom continues, the total might breach $US4 trillion. That will drive growth, albeit probably not many jobs. Net exports, negative in the June quarter but up 8.8 per cent in the September quarter, continued their volatile pattern this year as Trump\u2019s ever-changing tariffs caused big swings in imports, which fell really heavily (29.3 per cent) in the second quarter and were down 4.7 per cent in the third. Not too much can be definitively said about those numbers, given how erratic they have been and that it wasn\u2019t until August that the core of the tariffs were operative.\n\nThat, of course, didn\u2019t stop Trump from claiming that it was his tariffs that produced the economic growth. \u201cThe TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED,\u201d he posted on Truth Social, adding that the numbers would only get better. Separately, he once again argued for lower interest rates and said he would never appoint a new Fed chair who wasn\u2019t prepared to lower them. Trump will be able to nominate the next Fed chair when Jerome Powell\u2019s term ends next May. Jerome Powell\u2019s tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve is set to end in May. Credit: AP He might be disappointed. The apparent strength of the economy and the continued edging up of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure are more likely to encourage the Fed to watch and wait than lower rates early next year.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past 70 years, staff at the North American Aerospace Defence Command \u2013 or NORAD - in Colorado Springs have had a very important task.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally they're scanning the skies on matters of national security but at Christmas, the staff at Peterson Space Force Base turn their attention to Santa.\n\n\n\n\n\nNORAD spokeswoman Colonel Kelly Frushour says Santa is of course no threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's just that the same combination of radar, satellites and jets that help NORAD carry out its mission throughout the year make it capable of tracking Santa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"NORAD tracks Santa using the same capabilities that we use 24-7 to keep the avenues of approach to North America safe. It\u2019s a combination of radars, satellites and fighter jets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Alex Werden is one of the NORAD program managers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019re just happy that we\u2019re able to track them every single year. And the pilots that get to see them, they\u2019re lucky.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that's not all.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Colonel says there's also a hotline to answer callers' questions about Santa's mission - and Michelle Martin is one of the NORAD planners for the Christmas call centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s kind of funny because I don\u2019t think you ever really know who to expect on the other end of the line. Like I said, sometimes it could be a British pub and everybody\u2019s going wild and there\u2019s dozens of people in the background cracking up and having fun and asking us silly questions. And then all the way to a child maybe in hospital with their parent wondering if Santa\u2019s still going to stop by because they\u2019re in a hospital with their parents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nColonel Frushour says it all began seven decades ago when - legend has it - one child called the combat operations centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"70 years ago one young child accidentally dialled the predecessor of NORAD, which was the Continental Air Defense Command. And the colonel who answered the phone heard a child asking him, \u2018where is Santa Claus?\u2019 And the Colonel realised, well, we track everything over North America, and so we absolutely can see where Santa Claus is. We normally just track threats. But he looked up where Santa was and reported it to the child, and then our tradition was born.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time this year, Santa seekers can place a call through the program\u2019s website, which organisers say will be easier for people outside North America.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Martin says the website allows people to follow Santa\u2019s journey in nine languages, including English and Japanese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s nothing more special than a child\u2019s eyes lighting up or a child just feeling pure joy about something that they believe in, and it\u2019s a do-good thing. And so I think just hearing little kids laugh and giggle and ask silly questions, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s fun. And so if we could bring that joy to them in some way, shape or form, then I think we did our job.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile NORAD is based in North America and can follow Santa everywhere, it has helpers in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Services Australia spokesperson Laura Willard has told Channel 9 they have the responsibility of tracking Santa in the local region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Air Services is Australia's official Santa flight management team... We'll be giving Santa his pre-departure clearance with the call sign RED-ONE. There'll be no delays, just smooth sleighing all the way... RED-ONE will be entering Australian airspace over Norfolk Island, zig-zagging across the country, and vacating around the Cocos Islands at sunrise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile back in the United States, the NORAD hotline is already receiving plenty of calls.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Martin says more than a thousand volunteers are manning the phones this Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd she says they plan to continue the tradition as long as possible.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "With summer well and truly here, you might be in the market for a new pair of sunglasses.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the style, colour, price, and level of comfort they offer are all key considerations when selecting your shades, there's one feature that experts say should be everyone's top priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ambhruni Padhye, an optometrist and Specsavers clinical services development consultant, told SBS News: \"The most important factor is ensuring that you've got adequate UV protection.\"\n\n\n\nHow can UV rays damage your eyes?\n\nOverexposure to harmful UV radiation can damage your eye health temporarily and in the long-term.\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-term problems can include excessive blinking, swelling, challenges looking at strong light, and photokeratitis, which is similar to a sunburn of the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnita Dessaix, chair, Cancer Council Australia's Public Health Committee, told SBS News: \"Overtime, exposure to UV can potentially cause serious or permanent eye damage, including cataracts, cancer of the conjunctiva [membrane covering the white of the ey], skin cancer of the eyelids and around the eyes, solar keratopaty [cloudiness of the cornea], and pterygium [an overgrowth of the conjunctiva onto the cornea].\"\n\n\n\nHow to tell if your sunglasses offer good UV protection\n\nAll sunglasses sold in Australia must be tested and labelled in accordance with a mandatory standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are classified into five categories \u2014 from 0 to 4 \u2014 based on the level of protection they provide against sun glare and UV.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lens category number should be listed on the tag or sticker attached to the glasses, and is often printed on the inside of the frame, as well.\n\n\n\nSome or all of these symbols may be printed on the inside of your sunglasses frame. Source: SBS News / Amy Hall If you're buying sunglasses online, make sure to check the product description for the lens category number.\n\n\n\n\n\nDessaix said the Cancer Council recommends wearing close-fitting, wraparound sunglasses with a lens category of 2, 3 or 4 as they \"absorb 95 per cent of UV radiation\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe category of sunglasses that best suits your needs can vary depending on when you plan to wear them, Padhye said.\n\n\n\nEach lens category offers different levels of eye protection against sun glare and UV radiation. Source: SBS News \"Category 2 is medium tint and recommended for everyday sun with good UV protection,\" Padhye said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Category 3 is more of a darker tint, which is ideal for brighter outdoor conditions with strong glare.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile category 4 sunglasses are ideal for high-glare conditions like snow or water, they shouldn't be worn while driving at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose with a lens category of 0 or 1 are generally considered fashion spectacles rather than sunglasses and offer little to no UV protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nPadhye suggested consulting an eye care professional if you're unsure whether the sunglasses you're looking to buy or already own offer adequate UV or sun glare protection.\n\n\n\nOther ways to protect your eyes from UV damage\n\nWearing sunglasses isn't the only way to shield your eyes from UV damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWearing a wide-brimmed hat can add an extra layer of protection, helping to keep the sun off your eyes and face, Padhye said.\n\n\n\nWearing sunglasses is just one part of a sun safe routine. Source: SBS News \"Use sunscreen as well \u2014 just be careful because the skin around the eyes is delicate,\" Padhye said.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of eye sunburn\n\nIf your eyes are painful after being in the sun, you may have photokeratitis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is from the cells that are in your cornea getting damaged,\" Padhye said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The eye can be quite red as well. Sometimes you can get blurry vision, and this can be temporary, but it can also cause a lot of tearing and watery eyes and almost like a gritty, irritated feeling.\"\n\n\n\nHow to treat eye sunburn\n\nIf you suspect you have photokeratitis, Padhye said you should stay indoors to minimise further exposure to UV radiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you do wear contact lenses, I would advise taking them out to avoid further irritation to the eyes,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You should also avoid itching. It can be hard, of course, to try not to rub your eyes, but this will definitely make them worse.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the sunburn you may get on your face or body, photokeratitis can be treated at home.\n\n\n\n\"Some common treatments that can be applied for photokeratitis include using lubricating drops, pain relief medication, as well as placing a cold, damp cloth over your closed eyes to help soothe and cool the eyes,\" Padhye said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you want to ensure you're getting the most appropriate treatment, she recommended seeing an optometrist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do have all the technology to diagnose and treat, and if we do feel there needs further investigation, we can always refer to an eye specialist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for general information only and should not be relied on as a substitute for professional medical advice.

    "text": "With the countdown to Christmas underway, Australians are navigating a patchwork of trading hours to get their groceries, gifts, and essentials.\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor supermarkets, retail chains, liquor stores, and hardware outlets have all adjusted their operating schedules, with closures on Christmas Day and varying hours on surrounding holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\nState-specific restrictions mean what's open in one city may be closed just down the road.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor shoppers leaving things to the last minute, knowing what is open \u2014 and when \u2014 can make all the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a detailed guide across the main categories of stores.\n\n\n\nSupermarkets\n\nColes will operate normal hours up until Christmas Eve in all states. Stores are closed on Christmas Day and reopen on Boxing Day (except Adelaide metropolitan stores, which remain closed).\n\n\n\n\n\nWoolworths maintains extended trading hours leading up to Christmas. Stores are closed on Christmas Day and open on Boxing Day in most states, though some South Australian and Northern Territory stores will remain closed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAldi trading hours vary by store and state. All stores will be closed on Christmas Day, with some South Australian outlets also closed on Boxing Day.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The simple Christmas food swaps that'll cut your grocery bill\n\nOnly a few convenience stores and petrol stations will operate on Christmas Day for essential purchases.\n\n\n\nLiquor stores\n\nDan Murphy's, BWS, and Liquorland will be open on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Christmas Day, almost all stores are closed, with a few exceptions in Victoria and Tasmania. All stores reopen on Boxing Day.\n\n\n\nRetail stores\n\nKmart, Target, and Big W are all closed on Christmas Day. Trading resumes on Boxing Day, but hours can vary by location. Shoppers are advised to check individual store websites for local opening times.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestfield shopping centres are closed on Christmas Day. On Christmas Eve, most centres are open until 5\u20136pm. Centres will reopen on Boxing Day, with some trading until 9pm.\n\n\n\nOfficeworks' closing times on Christmas Eve depend on location. Stores reopen on Boxing Day but may operate under shorter hours.\n\n\n\nHardware stores\n\nBunnings Warehouse stores are open on Christmas Eve, with hours varying by location. All stores are closed on Christmas Day. From Boxing Day to 2 January, hours differ by store, and Bunnings Trade Centres and Frame and Truss facilities are closed from 25 December to 5 January.\n\n\n\n\n\nState-specific public holidays also affect trading hours, including Christmas Eve evenings in Queensland, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. Checking store locators or retailer websites is the best way to confirm local hours and plan your festive shopping efficiently.\n\n\n\nBanks\n\nAll major bank branches will be closed on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day, with customers advised to check their local branch for reopening times.\n\n\n\nBanks generally do not process payments made on public holidays on the same day, meaning transactions may not clear until the next business day. However, instant payment services such as PayID and Osko are expected to operate as normal over the holiday period, including on Christmas Day.\n\n\n\nMedical centres\n\nAfter-hours medical clinics and home-visiting doctor services will operate on Christmas Day for non-life-threatening illnesses and injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an emergency, people are advised to call triple-zero or attend their nearest hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency dental services are also expected to remain available nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome pharmacies will open on Christmas Day for prescriptions and essential medical supplies, though trading hours vary, and customers are encouraged to contact their local pharmacy in advance to confirm availability.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Former Liberal MP and respected doctor Katie Allen has died aged 59, her family announced on Tuesday, describing her as \"beloved\" and \"deeply loved\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of our beloved Katie [Mum],\" the family statement posted to Instagram said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She spent her life caring for others as a mother, doctor, professor, MP and friend. She is deeply loved. She passed in peace, surrounded by family and lived a full, beautiful life, all the way to the end. We love you so much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAllen revealed in May she had been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said at the time: \"It's a stage 4 diagnosis and has already spread. I know there are difficult days ahead, but I'm facing this with clarity and determination.\"\n\n\n\nThe post did not reveal how Allen died.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllen served as a member for the now-abolished seat of Higgins from 2019 to 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe challenged Labor's Carina Garland in the seat of Chisholm, which incorporated part of her former seat, at the 2025 federal election, but was unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring her time in parliament, Allen made headlines in 2022 when she crossed the floor to side with Labor on amendments to a religious discrimination bill, earning respect across the political spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore entering parliament, Allen was a paediatrician and director of population health at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute from 2011 to 2019.\n\n\n\nAllen was 'passionate about making a difference', Albanese says\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese paid tribute to Allen on Wednesday, saying he had \"enormous respect\" for her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She has passed far too soon. And I think for her colleagues in the Liberal Party, but right across the parliament, she had respect,\" he told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She always conducted herself in a respectful way, both in this parliament and on the campaign trail, and my thoughts go to Dr Allen's family, to her friends, to her former colleagues and to the community that she represented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was passionate about making a difference not just for that local community, but for our nation. And I join in mourning her passing.\"\n\n\n\nColleagues pay tribute\n\nFormer Victorian Liberal leader Brad Battin was among the first to pay tribute to Allen on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Life isn't fair for many. And for Katie \u2014 this was not fair. But the changes she made, the people she supported and the beliefs she lived, for many gave them the opportunity they may never have had. And with her support, life was more fair,\" he said on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal senator Jane Hume described Allen as \"an extraordinary woman, and an inspirational friend\".\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor senator Michelle Ananda-Rajah, who won Higgins in 2022 before she was elected to the Senate when the seat was abolished, also shared her condolences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hers was a life of service and you were all her triumph. My condolences to you all.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The festive season is known as a time to spread kindness and goodwill but in Denmark, learning and practising traits like compassion and empathy is a year-round craft.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 1993, all Danish students aged six to 16 have experienced social-emotional learning through the school curriculum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Danes believe that if you don't feel well, you don't learn well,\" said Jessica Joelle Alexander, a parenting expert and cultural researcher, with a specific expertise in the Danish parenting approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's also a big belief that our well-being is very tied to our sense of belonging and how we get along with others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese classes are seen as important developmental building blocks \u2014 teaching children skills such as emotional intelligence, building resilience, cooperation and active listening.\n\n\n\nDanish early childhood teacher, Nana Hammer, has grown up with the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We sat for maybe one and a half hours and discussed what was happening in the classroom, what were the dynamics, how did something made you feel? Was there anything you were struggling with? Do you find that there's any bullying?\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was actually a beautiful opportunity to touch base with your peers and again, be reminded that you're not the only one struggling with this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow teaching at a kindergarten in Sydney, she feels passionately about passing these skills on.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome researchers have linked this Danish method of learning empathy to higher levels of emotional resilience, social connectedness and even improved academic results.\n\n\n\nThe Nordic happiness podium\n\nAccording to the World Happiness Report, Nordic countries once again lead the happiness rankings with Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden sitting in the top four spots.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, ranked 11th in the report, ethics classes are run in hundreds of schools and are facilitated impartially by trained volunteers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeyza Tuncay, a volunteer teacher with ethics education provider Primary Ethics, said students often \"build skills in critical thinking, collaborative thinking, because they think for themselves, but they do it with other students\".\n\n\n\n\"They take away the notion that there are diverse opinions, there are diverse backgrounds, they learn how to have this respectful discussions or disagree respectfully.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing age-appropriate scenarios, students are encouraged to discuss their responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are topics like empathy, fairness, we talk about is lying ever okay. We talk about boasting, bragging or sharing,\" Tuncay explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With older ages we talk about jumping to conclusions, voting, \u2014 we talk about AI, interacting with AI.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the Danish system, this program supports the next generation to grow into empathetic adults.\n\n\n\n",

In some states, it brings with it a major driving crackdown, bigger penalties, and the risk of losing your licence altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not every state treats the holiday period the same.

    "text": "Since the end of September, retail sales have flatlined, motor vehicle sales have fallen, consumer confidence has continued to slump, real wages growth has stalled and the household savings rate has declined. Loading It is conceivable, therefore, that the data doesn\u2019t capture what consumers have been complaining about, which is an affordability crisis. It\u2019s also may be the case that there are two Americas. In one, with the sharemarket and property markets buoyant, the wealthy households exposed to them \u2013 particularly those with any exposure to anything AI-related \u2013 are feeling very positive and spending freely. Real personal consumer spending rose 3.5 per cent in the quarter, accelerating from the June quarter\u2019s 2.8 per cent growth rate.\n\nIn the other, middle and lower-income households are under pressure, with no real wages growth to offset the higher prices being driven by Trump\u2019s tariffs. The Commerce Department\u2019s report revealed that there was zero growth in personal disposable incomes in the third quarter. The US Federal Reserve Board\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, rose 2.8 per cent in the third quarter, up from 2.1 per cent in the preceding three months. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose from 2.6 per cent to 2.9 per cent. The growing gap between the wealth and spending patterns of the wealthiest households and the less wealthy, who are struggling to absorb the price increases, has led to the US being described as a \u201cK-shaped\u201d economy: one where asset-rich high-income earners thrive while low-to-middle income households struggle with slow wage growth and inflation. An analogous picture has emerged in business investment. Small and medium-sized businesses are struggling as their input costs have been driven up, with the tariffs a significant influence, and gross private domestic investment was actually falling in the September quarter, by 0.3 per cent, despite big increases in investments in equipment and intellectual property.\n\nThe AI investment boom is, it seems, holding up business investment by itself, which isn\u2019t surprising given the sheer scale of the numbers involved. There are estimates that it accounts for as much as a half the economic growth this year. Loading The so-called \u201chyperscalers\u201d \u2013 Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle \u2013 will spend about $US400 billion ($600 billion) this year and more than $US500 billion next year. By 2030, assuming the boom continues, the total might breach $US4 trillion. That will drive growth, albeit probably not many jobs. Net exports, negative in the June quarter but up 8.8 per cent in the September quarter, continued their volatile pattern this year as Trump\u2019s ever-changing tariffs caused big swings in imports, which fell really heavily (29.3 per cent) in the second quarter and were down 4.7 per cent in the third. Not too much can be definitively said about those numbers, given how erratic they have been and that it wasn\u2019t until August that the core of the tariffs were operative.\n\nThat, of course, didn\u2019t stop Trump from claiming that it was his tariffs that produced the economic growth. \u201cThe TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED,\u201d he posted on Truth Social, adding that the numbers would only get better. Separately, he once again argued for lower interest rates and said he would never appoint a new Fed chair who wasn\u2019t prepared to lower them. Trump will be able to nominate the next Fed chair when Jerome Powell\u2019s term ends next May. Jerome Powell\u2019s tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve is set to end in May. Credit: AP He might be disappointed. The apparent strength of the economy and the continued edging up of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure are more likely to encourage the Fed to watch and wait than lower rates early next year.",
