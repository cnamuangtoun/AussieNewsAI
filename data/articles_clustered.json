By 4pm (1am on Tuesday AEST), it still looked like it could be hours until power was restored.\n\nThe outage took out screens, lighting and power sockets, and caused traffic lights and subway systems to suddenly fail. Some power began to trickle back across Spain hours later, but efforts to fully revive the grid and to investigate the cause have not yet been successful.\n\nPeople try to board a crowded bus after the subway stopped running following a power outage in Lisbon, Portugal. (AP)\n\nIn Madrid, traffic piled up on the roads after the lights went out.\n\n\"I was driving and suddenly there was no traffic lights \u2026 It was a bit of a jungle,\" Luis Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Jim\u00e9nez told CNN.\n\n\"I saw a massive bus coming, and I had to accelerate a lot to go past it.\"\n\nThe cause of the sudden blackout was unclear, but its impact was dramatic.\n\nCalls to declare national emergency\ufeff\n\nThe cause of the blackout was unclear, but its impact was dramatic: transport hubs shuttered and governments in both countries, which share a population of about 60 million people, hastily co-ordinated a response.\n\nMadrid's mayor Jos\u00e9 Luis Martinez Almeida asked people to minimise their movements and only call emergency services if it was truly urgent. He also called on people to stay clear of the roads for emergency workers. Later in the day, Madrid's emergency services provider urged the country's government to declare a national emergency.\n\nPortugal's grid operator said restoring power was a \"complex operation\".\n\n\"At the moment it is impossible to predict when the situation will be normalised,\" it said.\n\nEfforts could stretch into the night.\n\n\"The experience of other similar events that have taken place in other countries indicate to us that this process \u2013 the total reestablishment of the electrical supply \u2013 will take several hours,\" Eduardo Prieto, director of services for system operation at Red El\u00e9ctrica, told broadcaster La Sexta.\n\nPassengers roam outside Atocha train station in Madrid.

Spain's health ministry said the same process happened in hospitals there.\n\nBut flights at major airports in the region were suddenly delayed or cancelled, with travelers scrambling to adapt; online flight trackers reported that several airports saw their frequent departures suddenly halted after midday. Portugal's flag carrier TAP Air Portugal told people not to travel to the airport until further notice.\n\nEllie Kenny, a holidaymaker inside Lisbon's Humberto Delgado airport, said hundreds of people were stood in the dark in queues, with no air conditioning or running water.

He was given a pacemaker in April 2019.\n\nHackman\u2019s carbon monoxide concentration was less than 5 per cent saturation, which is within the normal range. He tested negative for the hantavirus, which is a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings .\n\nGene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa are pictured in 1989. (Ralph Dominguez/MediaPunch /IPX/AP)\n\nAuthorities have said Hackman\u2019s wife, Betsy Arakawa, likely died February 11 at home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.\n\nHer autopsy report hasn\u2019t yet been released.\n\nA toxicology report says Hackman tested negative for alcohol and intoxicating drugs, but that he had a low concentration of acetone in his system that indicates prolonged fasting.\n\nHackman appeared to have outlived Arakawa at home by about a week, possibly unaware of his wife's death. Hackman\u2019s pacemaker showed an abnormal heart rhythm on February 18 \u2014 the day he likely died, according to the state's chief medical examiner.\n\nRecords released earlier in the investigation showed Arakawa made phone calls and internet searches as she scoured for information on flu-like symptoms and breathing techniques.\n\nRecently released videos outline the scope of the investigation into the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa.\n\nBefore they understood how Hackman and Arakawa died, authorities recorded themselves conducting interviews with workers and returning to Hackman\u2019s home to search for more evidence.\n\nDetectives searched the home in early March for Arakawa\u2019s laptop and other clues.\n\nA photo taken by investigators during the search of the home of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa. (Santa Fe County Sheriff)\n\nArakawa's computer showed that between February 8 and the morning of February 12, she was researching medical conditions related to COVID-19 and flu-like symptoms, according to the records released by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.\n\nIn an email to her masseuse, she said Hackman woke up on February 11 with flu or cold-like symptoms and she'd have to reschedule her appointment for the next day.\n\nHer search history on the morning of February 12 showed she was looking into a medical concierge service in Santa Fe. A call with the service lasted less than two minutes, and she missed a return call later that afternoon, according to investigators.\n\nNew images show inside home of Gene Hackman and wife after mysterious deaths View Gallery\n\nRedacted police body camera images showed officers going through the home and finding no signs of forced entry or anything out of the ordinary with the home's contents. Investigators took note of prescription medication on a bathroom counter as one of the couple's dogs barked in the background.\n\nInitially, all photos, video and documents from the investigation were sealed by a temporary court order.\n\nHackman's estate and Arakawa's mother asked a judge to extend that order, citing privacy concerns.\n\nThe Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter, saying in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies.",

(ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\n\"There's a few electric vehicles in town, I've noticed, but to have them out on a property \u2014 no doubt one day it will happen, but it's a little bit too early,\" he said.\n\nHe believed some hybrid vehicles could appeal to farmers.\n\n\"It was interesting to see the ad on TV [for a hybrid ute], where the farmer was in the paddock and he pulled up to do a bit of work on a strainer post on a gateway and he actually hooked up his electric welder to the vehicle to fix up a gate hinge, which I thought it was an interesting option,\" Mr Hartman said.\n\nOutback hybrid sales strong\n\nBroken Hill Motor Company general manager Liam Aitken said station workers tended to purchase Mazda BT50s or Toyota HiLuxes and LandCruisers.\n\n\"You're not going to see certain vehicles make a hybrid or a EV option because it's not going to be suitable to be able to tow that load, carry that load, travel that distance, or travel that type of terrain,\" he said.\n\nMr Aitken said hybrids accounted for about 40 per cent of business sales last year and that one EV was sold.\n\nLiam Aitken says people in rural areas need to be looked after.

(ABC Broken Hill: Jonathon Poulson)\n\nOver the border in South Australia, the RAA has rolled out charging stations over the 500km between Broken Hill and Adelaide.\n\nIn 2023, it planned to put a charging station in Yunta but had to backtrack.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Yunta has been removed from the scope of the network due to challenges associated with getting sufficient power to the site,\" head of EV charging Andrew Howard said.\n\n\"The RAA charge network now spans 143 sites, with over 550 plugs across the state \u2014 more than the original network scope \u2014 giving EV drivers more confidence to travel around regional SA than ever before.\"",

(AAP: Lukas Coch)\n\nMedia Watch quoted from an email sent from Mr Williams to Mr Latimer in which he said he was \"essentially on his [Gutman's] side\".\n\n\"Our people are often arrogant with talent,\" the email said.\n\n\"How often would someone like Austen Tayshus be in New England? Strange attitude. I know he can be demanding but he is talent.\"\n\nThe editorial decision was subsequently reversed and Mr Gutman secured an interview with ABC New England Breakfast a week later.\n\nIn relation to the email, Mr Williams told Media Watch: \"I did not at any time intervene and would never seek to override editorial judgement from local teams.\"\n\n\"My comment was about responding to talent.\"\n\n'Inappropriate' pressure\n\nMedia Watch reported the actions prompted some staff members to raise concerns about editorial independence.\n\nManaging director Hugh Marks, who joined the broadcaster earlier this year, described the matters raised by Media Watch as \"important\".\n\n\"I have been at the ABC a short time but I am vigilant to ensure the proper delineation of responsibility between the Board and management, and will act appropriately to ensure the best interests of the ABC, its people and audiences as we move forward,\" he said.\n\nHugh Marks said the matters raised by Media Watch are \"important\". (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nFormer ABC editorial director Alan Sunderland told Media Watch board members needed to take great care not to be seen as \"lobbying or pressuring for a specific editorial outcome\".\n\nHe said in the examples cited, the chair appeared to be intervening on behalf of someone he knew.\n\n\"This sort of pressure on program teams from any board member, let alone the chairman, is in my view inappropriate,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact that it was not only passed on but acted upon by program teams who felt pressured to change their editorial judgement, indicates a significant failure of process and judgement, both on the part of the chairman and senior management.\"\n\nWhile Mr Gutman described Mr Williams as a \"friend\", Mr Williams said he was an acquaintance with whom he had \"brief involvement some 27 years ago\".\n\nIn a later statement, Mr Gutman said he was not sure if he had ever met Mr Williams.\n\n\"I contacted him because I thought he may be able to help me with what I perceived as lack of impartiality on the part of some journos,\" he said.\n\n\"All I expected was some help with some interviews and that's what I got from him and Ben Latimer.\"\n\nABC News approached Mr Latimer for comment.\n\nIn response to the Media Watch segment, the ABC said in a statement: \u201cIn recent months ABC management spoke with Mr Gutman to express clear expectations of his behaviour to staff when pitching interviews and discuss how the ABC makes editorial decisions.\n\n\u201cThe ABC regularly engages with members of the performance community for appearances across our networks and it\u2019s important for the arts and entertainment sectors that we continue to do so.\n\n\u201cThe ABC Chair has always made clear he expects ABC management to follow its own independent decision-making on content. As the Editorial Policies state, the trust and respect of the community depend on the ABC\u2019s editorial independence and integrity.\u201d",

    "text": "Firefighter and Queensland field goal specialist Lauren Brown is the queen of the big moment, because no-one understands pressure the same way she does.\n\nOn the field and off it, the versatile 30-year-old life's work has been all about facing pressure head-on.\n\nLast year's 68th-minute golden point field goal in Game II of the State of Origin series was a classic case in point.\n\nWith the Maroons trailing 1-0 in the series and scores locked up, she landed a stunner in pouring rain and into a gale to secure an 11-10 win, a feat Brown had performed several times for Gold Coast in the NRLW.\n\nThe Maroons went on to win the series 2-1.\n\nABC Sport will provide live coverage of the Women's State of Origin Game I from Brisbane, with a live blog and radio commentary from 7pm AEST on Thursday.\n\nAhead of Thursday night's Origin opener at Lang Park, the Maroons magician explained several home truths about pressure.\n\n\"I'm a firefighter by day and night. If we are rocking up to a house fully engulfed in fire it can be a life-or-death situation,\" she told AAP.\n\n\"That is what real pressure is, making sure you don't let it overwhelm you.\n\n\"You go back to being task-focused. It helps shift you back to your principles and process.\n\nLauren Brown kicked a last-gasp field goal to win Game II for the Maroons. (AAP Image: NRL Photos/Gregg Porteous)\n\n\"That allows you to harness the adrenaline, nerves and pressure by doing what you have been trained to do in those situations. That has helped me on the footy field as well.\n\n\"The training we receive in academy for firefighting is incredible and they always put us in worst cases [scenarios] so you are ready \u2026 to do your best possible job.\"\n\nSo does training for do-or-die moments help in front of the posts?\n\n\"I guess subconsciously it does translate across, to not worrying about the outcome and going back to process,\" she said.\n\nABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women's Sport Survey: We want to hear from you Photo shows A stylised graphic with three silhouettes of unidentified a female footballer, tennis player, basketballer ABC Sport and Deakin University have partnered to produce the first ABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women\u2019s Sport Survey.\n\n\"I don't think about that when I am on the field. What I do relate to is that muscle memory, so I make sure I do one or two field goal sessions a week.\n\n\"It is just like I am down at Burleigh Bears practising with Dad. I am not one to think before I kick a field goal, 'Is it going to go in?'\n\n\"It is more about catch the ball, get a good ball drop, a good follow through with my [leg] swing, keep my head down and hopefully by the time I look up it is sailing through, which lucky enough it did [in Newcastle].\"\n\nBrown recalled the best part of last year's magic moment was looking at teammates and \"seeing how much it meant to them\".\n\n\"I'm a footy tragic. You watch so many iconic moments over the years where my favourite players \u2014 [Darren] Lockyer, [Johnathan] Thurston, [Cooper] Cronk \u2014 have iced moments like that,\" she said.\n\n\"When you are a little kid down the park you imagine there's 10 seconds to go and you have to land it to win.\n\n\"I look back at the field goal and I am super grateful \u2026 but everyone in the team did something that contributed to the win.\"\n\nBrown said the Maroons were determined to make amends for last year's Game I loss in Brisbane and \"make Queenslanders proud\".\n\nAAP",

Photo shows Colouring pencils in a plastic container. Here is some practical advice to help you feel confident in your childcare provider \u2014 and what to do if something does not seem right.\n\nIt's emblematic of the \"corporatisation\" of childcare in Australia. And experts say it's putting kids at risk.\n\n\"Private equity, pension funds and publicly listed businesses all have investors expecting a return \u2014 and this is what creates significant risks for the quality of care,\" said Macquarie University Professor Gabrielle Meagher, who studies privatisation of social services.\n\n\" These businesses are motivated to come into the childcare sector by the opportunity that a highly-subsidised, high-demand service offers. \"\n\nGovernment subsidies, increased women's workforce participation and a push to promote the benefits of early education have fuelled enormous growth with almost 15,000 centres operating today.\n\nAustralia's top 10 for-profit childcare providers and their ownership G8 Education \u2013 ASX listed Affinity \u2013 private equity owned Guardian \u2013 private equity owned Busy Bees \u2013 owned by the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan Nido Early School \u2013 ASX listed Only About Children \u2013 wholly owned subsidiary of NYSE-listed Bright Horizons Green Leaves \u2013 private equity owned Edge Early Learning \u2013 private equity owned Montessori Academy \u2013 majority owned by founders Charles and Colette Assaf Sparrow Early Learning \u2013 majority owned by Fullshare, listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange (Source: Professor Gabrielle Meagher Macquarie University)\n\n\"Children are missing out on high-quality education and care experiences that could set them up for life,\" Professor Meagher said.\n\n\"In some cases children are exposed to unsafe environments and poor treatment.\"\n\nThe honey pot attracting investors is huge. Subsidies to the industry from Australian taxpayers are on track to cost the budget $15 billion a year by 2026-2027.\n\nMacquarie University Professor Gabrielle Meagher studies privatisation of social services. (Supplied)\n\nSeventy per cent of the centre-based recipients are run by private operators and a recent Four Corners investigation revealed serious failings endangering kids at some centres.\n\nIt also revealed sloppy regulation with 10 per cent of all centres \u2014 covering an estimated 47,000 kids in privately-owned centres \u2014 not meeting national quality standards.\n\nMany parents are choosing for-profit centres, including OAC, so clearly these operators are keeping parents happy.\n\nBut that business model is allowing unscrupulous providers to \"put profit before our children\" in some cases, said Maddy Butler from Parenthood, an independent group that advocates for parents.\n\n\"In the worst instances this leaves children vulnerable to mistreatment and educators underpaid, working in poor conditions,\" she said.\n\nThese views are backed up by a number of expert reviews that revealed better conditions at not-for-profits and government-run services.\n\nChildcare disadvantage Photo shows A young mother sitting on a couch with a smiling toddler lying across her lap With research showing educational disadvantage can begin as young as two if children cannot access child care, experts are demanding more action from the major parties.\n\n\"Forty-three per cent of government-managed services and 37 per cent of not-for-profit, community-managed services are exceeding the National Quality Standard, as opposed to only 12 per cent of for-profit services,\" Ms Butler said.\n\n\"For-profit providers also tend to charge higher fees.\"\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found not-for-profits spent more on staff, had higher retention levels and more full-time rather than casual workers.\n\nBright Horizon's filing to the NYSE gives an insight into its approach to resourcing its centres.\n\n\"We seek to cluster centres in geographic areas to enhance operating efficiencies and to create a leading market presence,\" the annual filing said.\n\nAmong other things, that kind of clustering has led to a phenomenon dubbed \"childcare deserts\", which is leaving families in poorer areas without enough places.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn a perfect world a profit motive might drive higher quality, as services sought to compete for more enrolments by lifting quality \u2014 meeting the needs of children and shareholders alike.\n\nHowever, OAC's website lists just 10 of its 80 centres as exceeding the national quality standards despite being located in some of the most expensive suburbs for childcare.\n\nABC News also recently revealed serious incidents at a number of OAC facilities including inappropriate contact when a child was kissed on the lips and others were disciplined with excessive force.\n\nAn educator at another centre was sentenced to two years in prison for touching a young boy on the groin and bottom.\n\nDo those shocking incidents and the comments to the NYSE suggest the profits of US shareholders are being put above the needs of Australian children?\n\nOAC did not respond to a request for comment. But it's far from alone in juggling profit and care, and others that aren't publicly traded can operate with even less public scrutiny.\n\nThat has left some experts calling for a reconsideration of the model of funding for profit operators.\n\nAustralia's childcare rating system labelled 'a joke' Photo shows A child playing with magnetic plastic shapes on a surface. The child's face can't be seen. With centres reassessed on average every four years, and some gaming the system, parents cannot be sure their child's centre meets the standards or that staff are properly trained or qualified.\n\n\"We don't know enough about what goes on inside these companies \u2014 how they use public funds and how they organise their staff and operations \u2014 especially when it comes to private equity companies who do not have the same reporting obligations as listed companies,\" Professor Meagher said.\n\nDuring the ABC election debate, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he hoped childcare would be his legacy.\n\n\"We want the universal provision of affordable childcare so that it is as natural to have your child have access to childcare as it is to have access to public education,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\nBut there's a crucial difference between the operators of schools and the operators of childcare centres.\n\nUnlike childcare centres, private schools are not allowed to operate as for-profit enterprises.\n\nHowever, Mr Albanese's plan to grow the childcare industry is relying on for-profit operators, capable of building centres quickly and at scale, to deliver his ambition.\n\nThat's left some experts sceptical.\n\n\"The government's universal childcare policy is an important step forward for children and families but if the quality of early learning centres does not improve, it will not achieve its aims,\" Professor Meagher said.\n\nDisturbing childcare incidents exposed Photo shows Children play with toys at a preschool Some of the country's largest childcare operators are named in a damning cache of regulatory documents the NSW government and regulator tried to keep hidden from the public.\n\n\"Currently the system is going in the wrong direction, given what we know about quality and costs.\"\n\nFollowing the 4 Corners investigation the government announced it would target operators that put \"profit over quality\" in a new enforcement scheme co-designed with industry.\n\nThe government said there was only a \"small number\" of operators doing the wrong thing.\n\nThe Australian Childcare Alliance, a lobby group that advocates for many for-profit providers did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt has previously welcomed the government's new scheme and noted the government's comments about problems being confined to a small group of operators.\n\nIf the government is re-elected and the expansion of childcare continues, then likely so too will the conflict between the operator's responsibilities to shareholders and the nation's most vulnerable.",

    "text": "The condition of Karijini National Park's spectacular gorges is worrying traditional owners and business operators as Western Australia's tourism season looms.\n\nThe national park, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year, is the traditional home of the Banjima, eastern Kuruma, and Yingawangka people.\n\nBanjima man Felix Wilfert is a wood carver who often cuts paperbark trees from Karijini.\n\nHe said there was a creek that flowed through the back roads and that the water was always deep enough to cover the bonnet of his vehicle.\n\n\"The last time I went there, last year, there was no water there \u2014 nothing,\" he said.\n\nFelix Wilfert says he has seen trees dying in parts of the national park. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nMr Wilfert said trees appeared to be dying in the area and that parts of the park were drier than usual.\n\nMr Wilfert said that because of the area's high altitude, the water at Karijini ran down the hills to neighbouring tributaries.\n\n\"Water and rain are a big thing to us,\" he said.\n\n\"It mainly runs all underground.\n\n\"It's like the backbone of our culture \u2014 that's what the elders left behind.\n\n\"They said: 'Take care of the land and the water.'\"\n\nRepeat visitors and tourism operators say the trail leading to Hancock Gorge is usually filled with waist-high water. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nRisk of partial closure\n\nKarijini Eco Retreat manager Drew Norrish said long-time staff and repeat guests were noticing lower water levels at some gorges.\n\n\"We need the gorges to remain open all season,\" he said.\n\n\"When there's no water flow, it can cause stagnated water and parts of the national park can close.\n\n\" There are several hundred thousand people that come through every year and water plays a massive part in the experience. \"\n\nMr Norrish said the situation was puzzling because he believed the area had received more rain over the most recent wet season \u2014 November to April \u2014 than the previous season.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology's only weather station in the national park has already recorded 113 more millimetres of rain this wet season than the 2023\u201324 season.\n\nMr Wilfert suggested neighbouring mining companies could be causing the lower water levels.\n\n\"I think it's something to do with mining and there should be water there all the time, really,\" he said.\n\nKarijini's waterfalls and gorges attract hundreds of thousands of tourists to WA's Pilbara region every year. (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\nMiners vow to protect park\n\nThe national park sits within the heart of the Pilbara's multi-billion-dollar network of iron ore mines, which are owned by some of the country's biggest companies, including BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group, and Hancock Prospecting.\n\nRio Tinto's Marandoo mine is bordered by the national park on three sides and is about 50 kilometres from some of the most popular gorges.\n\nSince 2010, Rio Tinto has mined below the water table at Marandoo, which involves the removal of groundwater to access the iron ore.\n\nA Rio Tinto spokesperson said the aquifer connected to Marandoo was regularly monitored.\n\nThere has been speculation about the impact mines in the area could be having on the park. (ABC Pilbara: Charlie Mclean)\n\n\"We continue to conduct monitoring of all water sources we access as required under our environmental approvals,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\" Our work is ongoing to reduce water usage across our operations. \"\n\nFortescue Metals Group, which also operates mines near Karijini, said it always tried to minimise its impact on the environment.\n\n\"Regarding Karijini National Park specifically, we recognise its environmental and cultural significance and remain committed to safeguarding this iconic region,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nCalls for investigation\n\nMr Norrish said it was time for the state government to investigate the condition of the gorges.\n\n\"It's not healthy to have speculative reasons,\" he said.\n\n\"I just feel like we as a community \u2026 need to get the facts on the table so we can deal with it knowing that everyone has the same information.\"\n\nThe Department of Water and Environmental Regulation did not respond when asked if it would investigate the situation, but pointed out rainfall during the past three wet seasons at Karijini National Park had been below the long-term average.\n\n\"This results in low recharge to watercourses and aquifers,\" the department said in a statement.\n\n\" The government is confident that the monitoring regimes and protections in place are appropriate. \"\n\nDrew Norrish wants the government to investigate, but says the national park is still a top destination. (ABC Pilbara: Charlie McLean)\n\nThe ABC understands an organisation representing some of the national park's traditional owners has started its own investigation and commissioned a hydrogeologist to assist.\n\nMr Norrish said people visiting Karijini this year could still expect a great experience.\n\n\"You know, [there are] two billion years of geology, but also the cultural connection to country \u2014 it's very active and still very much alive with the traditional owners,\" he said.\n\n\"Karijini is one of the most amazing places in Australia \u2026 so we're very keen to make sure it remains at the top of the list for tourists travelling through WA.\"",

For me that was a major part of my history when I look back.\"\n\n\"We would go out drinking every day before we moved and that\u2019s not to say we didn\u2019t drink at all, but I did find that quite sad that we couldn't do that anymore, we didn't have that flow of literally going to drink every single day.\"\n\nUematsu established the signature Final Fantasy sound which draws influences from classical music, along with rock and jazz, with composers like Soken building on that canon 'sound' of the games with their own compositions.\n\nThe famous piece One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII for example draws equally from the music of Stravinsky and Jimmy Hendrix according to interviews with Uematsu.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nEach piece of music in Final Fantasy features a strong memorable melody, which works as well with the original basic 1980s and 1990s chiptune synthesisers of early video game consoles or arranged for a full orchestra.\n\nThe main theme of the series, Prelude, originally composed by Uematsu and featured in nearly every game in the series has been recontextualised in Soken's Final Fantasy XVI piece, Land of Eikons, which moves the classic harp melody into a darker minor key.\n\nComposing with acting performance as a guide\n\nSoken, who only speaks Japanese, says his music was inspired heavily by acting performances of lead characters in the game, even though in some cases he couldn't understand what the performers were saying.\n\n\"For [Final Fantasy] XVI quite early on in the process I knew that all of the voice actors would be key and I was able to receive inspiration from the acting performances of the voice actors while writing,\" says Soken.\n\n\"I'm not very good at speaking English, so when I listen to the English voice acting, I can't really tell the details of the words but I can understand what is actually being portrayed through the performance.\n\n\"That is proof for how extraordinary their performance was and so I wanted to make the best music that I can to contribute to that game experience that was already there.\"\n\nThe concert series Distant Worlds: music from Final Fantasy was co-founded by game series composer Nobuo Uematsu and music director and conductor Arnie Roth. (Supplied: AWR Music/ Square Enix)\n\nMusic that stops the world\n\nSoken plays rock versions of his Final Fantasy music live with band The Primals, and said that he was still touched by the energy that players around the world share after playing the games and listening to his performances.\n\n\"We have Primals performances in big halls and when we play [Final Fantasy XIV musical piece] Rise, there's obviously that time-stop moment and you see tens of thousands of people stopping all together, that is brilliant to see.\"\n\n\"I really am just touched by the energy that all of the [players] have and I'm very much moved by their extraordinary energy.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\n\"So I would say that what hasn't changed in all these years is that all of this is about the game experience, everyone is trying to feel the game.\"\n\n\" I think that there are aspects of music and sound that are more important than others but what I like about it is that I'm just a gamer, that's how I feel. \"\n\nSign up to the ABC Classic Newsletter",

(ABC News: Glen Mullane)\n\nShe said it would be devastating if the sport was not involved in Brisbane.\n\n\"It would make me really sad because I think that it would be such a downfall for our sport,\" she said.\n\n\"We struggle to compete with the bigger professional sports, rugby, the AFL, now that have all strong women's programs, we just don't have that presence, and we don't have the same funding.\n\n\"So if we're not in 2032 \u2026 I'm not too sure what would happen to the sport of softball post that, particularly for young girls.\"\n\nPitch for international appeal\n\nSoftball/baseball last appeared at the Olympics in Tokyo 2020. (Getty Images: Yuichi Masuda)\n\nLast month, Brisbane Organising Committee boss Andrew Liveris told the ABC in a wide-ranging interview that any sports added to the Brisbane Games needed to have a \"financial positive\" and \"it can't be criteria that's a flight of fancy.\"\n\nHe has since told ABC Sport that the committee's focus is working with bodies, including the IOC, International Paralympic Committee, sports federations and AOC, to finalise the sport program.\n\nABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women's Sport Survey: We want to hear from you Photo shows A stylised graphic with three silhouettes of unidentified a female footballer, tennis player, basketballer ABC Sport and Deakin University have partnered to produce the first ABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women\u2019s Sport Survey.\n\n\"We've had strong interest from a range of sports wanting to be involved in our Games and I expect that interest will continue in the months ahead,\" he said.\n\n\"We look forward to our sport program taking shape and presenting it to the IOC and IPC in due course.\"\n\nLoh said she wanted to remind organisers that softball and baseball are not new Olympic sports, as they have to pitch along with dozens of other sports to be included in the program for Brisbane.\n\n\"We're working really, really hard \u2026 to demonstrate our power in growing the game and having that ability to generate revenue for Brisbane Olympics,\" she said.\n\n\"We are international sports.

    "text": "When Rajasthan Royals announced they had signed a 13-year-old for the Indian Premier League, there was plenty of scepticism.\n\nIt looked, at best, like the start of a long-term plan to lay claim to and develop a promising youngster. At worst, it looked like a gimmick.\n\nNo-one is sceptical now.\n\nIn his third match the now-14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi has smashed the second fastest century in the IPL's 18 seasons, a blistering 35-ball display of pyrotechnics that carried his team to a thumping eight-wicket victory over Gujarat Titans in Jaipur.\n\nOnly \"Universe Boss\" Chris Gayle has hit a quicker IPL ton than his fellow left-hander, and \"Baby Boss\" Suryavanshi would have been close to that 30-ball display had he not played himself in with nine off his first seven balls \u2014 albeit that included a straight six off 140kph Indian Test seamer Ishant Sharma.\n\nThereafter he hit 92 off 28 balls, including ten more sixes and seven fours.\n\nA couple of boundaries were streaky, but most were hit with devastating power, with fearless clean hitting all round the wicket.\n\nHis century was brought up with a six over mid-wicket off skilled leg spinner Rashid Khan.\n\nEvery boundary was rapturously cheered by pink-clad Royals fans in the \"Pink City\".\n\nBy the time Suryavanshi was yorked for 101, Royals were well on the way to overhauling Titans' 4-209, doing so with 25 balls to spare, ending a five-match losing streak.\n\nYashasvi Jaiswal, dropped by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler on 2, made 70 not out.\n\n\"Incredible innings, one of the best I have seen,\" said Jaiswal of Suryavanshi, whose innings was made against a high-class attack of Test bowlers.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nJaiswal, who himself was hailed as a tyro when making Test and IPL centuries as a 21-year-old two years ago, added: \"I hope he will do it for us for a long time.\n\n\"I was telling him to just keep going. He just played amazing shots, he practises well, works hard in the nets. He has the game and temperament, I wish him all the luck.\"\n\n\"It was Suryavanshi's day, his hitting was tremendous and he made full use of it,\" said Shubman Gill, Gujarat's captain, who himself made 84 off 50 balls, backed up by Buttler's unbeaten 50 off 26.\n\nThe boy himself was still taking it in.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" he said.\n\n\"What I've been practising for the last three-four months, the result is showing. I don't see the ground so much, just focus on the ball.\n\n\" It is like a dream, to score a century in the IPL. \"\n\nTitans, in third with 12 points, are still well-placed to make the play-offs. Royals, in eighth with six, are unlikely to do so.

    "text": "Australians are being targeted with misleading claims originating from bias or poorly constructed polls and surveys.\n\nNot all polls are scientific or accurate. Sometimes, what politicians say about them is even less so.\n\nABC NEWS Verify takes a tour of some of the ways polling can influence or mislead voters, with questions you can ask yourself about polls to avoid getting fooled.\n\n1. Who is being sampled?\n\nLabor is seeking to use Peter Dutton\u2019s time as health minister, from 2013 to 2014, against him.\n\nAcross countless soundbites and ads from the party, Labor is claiming that Australian doctors voted Mr Dutton as the worst health minister in decades.\n\nThe claim has been made across many platforms, including social media. (Facebook: Australian Labor Party)\n\nBut does that stack up?\n\nThe claim comes from an online survey conducted a decade ago by a publication called Australian Doctor, shortly after Mr Dutton left the role of health minister \u2014 a period which included introducing a controversial policy for a GP co-payment.\n\nStay updated: Federal election live updates: Get the latest news from the campaign trail Catch the latest interviews and in-depth coverage on ABC iview and ABC Listen\n\nThe online survey pitted Mr Dutton against nine former health ministers from both parties, and asked: \u201cWho has been the worst federal health minister in recent memory?\u201d\n\nForty-six per cent of respondents put Mr Dutton as their answer.\n\nContact Hidden Campaign Photo shows A designed image showing an eye, a ballot paper and ballot box, pencil and social media like, love and angry symbols. During the federal election, ABC NEWS will be shining a light on the hidden campaign, revealing how you're being targeted, why and by whom, and we need your help.\n\nAs the publication\u2019s editor Paul Smith wrote this year, the survey was conducted in 2015 \u2013 meaning it doesn\u2019t include subsequent health ministers like the Coalition\u2019s Sussan Ley and Greg Hunt, or the incumbent Mark Butler\n\nHe wrote the poll ran for 24 hours and had a sample of only 1,077 respondents drawn from the publication\u2019s readership.\n\nAt the time, the publication itself had a total readership of around 20,000.\n\nElection analyst Kevin Bonham told ABC NEWS Verify the survey \u201csounds like it's an opt-in poll where it's just taking whoever actually responds\u201d.\n\nAsked whether it was misleading to use the findings of the poll to suggest this was representative of Australian doctors, a spokeswoman for the Labor Party didn't directly answer the question.\n\nSo without running a scientific poll today, it\u2019s impossible to know whether such a large proportion of doctors would consider Mr Dutton in the same light as Labor\u2019s claim.\n\n2. Is the survey omitting results?\n\nIn February, Trumpet of Patriots chairman Clive Palmer claimed polling showed Australian support for \u2018Trump-like\u2019 policies.\n\nThe media release omitted the percentage of respondents who said no. (Supplied: Trumpet of Patriots)\n\nMr Palmer used the results to launch his new party during a press conference on February 19.\n\n\u201cAustralia needs Trump policies. Australians want them as the opinion polls have shown us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe claim has also been used in YouTube ads run by the Trumpet of Patriots featuring Mr Palmer\u2019s press conference.\n\nBut despite the assertion that Australians want \u2018Trump-like\u2019 policies, is this really what the poll results showed?\n\nA closer look at the actual polling results, linked at the bottom of a press release, shows more people said they don\u2019t want Trump-like policies, than those who said they did.\n\nWould you vote for a party with Trump-like policies?\n\nBrisbane: 34% Yes, 18% Unsure, 48% No\n\nSydney: 25% Yes, 20% Unsure, 55% No\n\nMelbourne: 29% Yes, 20% Unsure, 52% No\n\nAdelaide: 26% Yes, 19% Unsure, 55% No\n\n\"The poll only shows that a small proportion of voters say that they would support a party with Trump like policies,\u201d said Dr Bonham.\n\nHe also pointed out that the wording of the question doesn\u2019t indicate whether those voters interested in Trump-like policies would vote for Trumpet of Patriots ahead of other parties with similar views.\n\n3. Does the poll contain leading questions?\n\nA poll heard by ABC NEWS Verify contained a leading question about independent MP Sophie Scamps. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s not the results of a poll that can influence voters, but the poll itself.\n\nSome polls contain leading questions. While they may still be used to gather data, they might also influence respondents to vote a certain way.\n\nABC NEWS Verify has heard a recording of a poll targeting voters in Sydney\u2019s Mackellar electorate, held by independent Climate 200-backed MP, Dr Sophie Scamps.\n\nIt describes her in a favourable light \u2013 highlighting her achievements in the medical profession, and in parliament.\n\n\u201cDr Sophie Scamps has spent her first term in parliament as an independent fighting for cost-of-living relief, better economic management, stronger climate policy and honest politics. Prior to being elected she was a GP in Narrabeen and an emergency room doctor in our local hospitals. Knowing this about Dr Sophie Scamps, if a federal election were held today, who would receive your first preference vote?\u201d the survey asked, after demographic and other voting questions.\n\nLoading...\n\nOther candidates in the poll were mentioned in name only.\n\nClimate 200 has confirmed it commissioned the poll, describing it as \"standard message testing\".\n\nDr Bonham questioned the usefulness of what he referred to as \u201caided questions\u201d in research, \u201cbecause they capture the support for the candidate in an environment where the voter has heard only good things\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to avoid suspecting that an advantage of this kind of polling is that it gets \u2026 positive claims about candidates out there in the community and it\u2019s a kind of advertising designed to work by word-of-mouth,\u201d he said.\n\n4. Have you been served a push poll?\n\nSeparately, there have also been allegations of so-called \u2018push-polling\u2019 mobilised against independent Climate 200-backed candidates in other seats, such as Goldstein in Melbourne and Wentworth in Sydney.\n\nFollow the latest election news Photo shows ABC News Radio logo and the ABC Listen logo below it on a light blue background. Hear the latest election news as it happens on the Election Central Playlist. Only on the ABC listen app.\n\nPush polls contain loaded questions, and are designed to influence rather than genuinely survey voters.\n\nABC NEWS Verify has seen a poll featuring independent MP Allegra Spender, which was reportedly sent to voters in Sydney\u2019s Wentworth electorate.

    "text": "On Wall Street overnight, stocks drifted to a mixed finish on Monday, ahead of potential flashpoints later this week that could bring more sharp swings for financial markets. The S&P 500 inched up by 0.1 per cent to extend its winning streak to a fifth day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1 per cent.\n\nEndeavour shares rose 0.5 per cent. The retailer and hotel owner, which runs the bottle shop chains Dan Murphy\u2019s and BWS, said this morning that former Virgin chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka will become its new boss from January 1, with executive chairman Ari Mervis continuing in his role until then.\n\nAustralia\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, Woodside, edged up 0.1 per cent after making its final investment decision on a $17.5 billion ($27.4 billion) liquefied natural gas export project in the US, cementing its position as a top supplier of the fuel. The approval clears the way for large-scale construction of the Louisiana LNG export plant, which is targeting its first shipment in 2029, Woodside said.\n\nThe relative lull in trading offered a respite from the sharp, historic swings that have rocked markets for weeks, as hopes rose and fell that President Donald Trump may back down on his trade war. Many investors believe Trump\u2019s tariffs could cause a recession if left unaltered. Coming into Monday, the S&P 500 had roughly halved its drop that had taken it nearly 20 per cent below its record set earlier this year.\n\nYet with a jittery April near its close, several market pros see little reason to think volatility is in the rearview mirror. For sharemarkets to keep rising, investors would need to see Donald Trump\u2019s White House follow through on the \u201cdovish pivot\u201d toward trade with China, according to Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n\nMixed trading for some influential tech stocks ahead of their earnings reports this week pulled the S&P 500 back and forth between modest gains and losses for much of the session overnight.\n\nAmazon fell 0.7 per cent, Microsoft dipped 0.2 per cent, Meta Platforms added 0.4 per cent, and Apple rose 0.4 per cent. All are set to report their latest result this week, and they\u2019re some of Wall Street\u2019s most influential companies because they\u2019ve grown to become some of the biggest in terms of size, by far. That gives their movements extra weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nOutside of big tech, executives from Caterpillar, ExxonMobil, and McDonald\u2019s may also offer clues this week about how they\u2019re seeing economic conditions play out. Several companies across various industries have already slashed their estimates for upcoming profits or pulled their forecasts entirely due to uncertainty about what will happen with Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

    "text": "A group of 14 young Ugandan and Kenyan performers who were scheduled to arrive in Australia have been refused entry, forcing the cancellation of their cultural charity tour.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group was set to perform as part of the Ubuntu Africa Tour organised by KwaYa Australia, a not-for-profit organisation that fosters cultural exchange and education for Ugandan children through music and outreach.\n\n\n\n\n\nKwaYa Australia had planned an eight-week schedule of events aimed at promoting cultural understanding and raising funds for African youth programs. It has previously run five national tours successfully under the same initiative.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were due to leave Africa for Australia this Friday.\n\n\n\nDreams dashed as visa refusals force tour cancellation\n\nThe performers had applied for the GG-408 Entertainment Activity Visa under the Cultural Subclass, designed to support programs that promote international cultural exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, all 14 applications were refused by the Department of Home Affairs, citing concerns under Clause 408.213 \u2014 specifically, that the applicant 'genuinely intends to stay in Australia temporarily to carry out the activity for which the visa is granted'.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has seen the letters of rejection issued to multiple members of the group by the Department of Home Affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS has contacted the department but had not received a response at the time of writing.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Questions over extended wait times for parent visa applicants\n\nOne of the key criteria for assessment is whether the applicants have previously travelled to Australia, complied with visa conditions, and provided sufficient evidence of their genuine intention to stay temporarily as entertainers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarsha Gusti, president and founder of KwaYa Australia, said the decision has devastating consequences not only for the young performers but also for their charity partners and supporters in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke appealing the decision, she wrote: \"Are we now saying that only those who have already entered Australia can be trusted, while first-time visitors, no matter how strong their evidence, cannot?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If this precedent holds, then we are effectively closing the door permanently on cultural exchange with new African participants.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition to cut international student numbers by 80,000, raise visa application fees\n\nIf this precedent holds, we are effectively closing the door permanently on cultural exchange. Marsha Gusti, president and founder of KwaYa Australia\n\nThe group estimates that cancelling the tour will result in an $80,000 direct financial loss, with up to $600,000 in potential sponsorship and fundraising opportunities now in jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nGusti said she was \"absolutely flummoxed\" by the decision, questioning what message it sends about Australia's reputation on the world stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Ubuntu Africa program just sent a bunch of kids over to the UK. They travelled for two months and were celebrated all across the UK ... they were first-time travellers just as ours were,\" Gusti said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Are we now not welcoming cultural performers? Do they have to have been here twice? And how do they get to be here twice if they're not allowed here once?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGusti also questioned whether the same decision would have been made if the group were a sports team, asking: \"Is this a cultural thing?\"\n\n\n\nFaith Nasande says she hopes the government will reconsider their decision. Source: Supplied\n\nHope remains as performers appeal for a second chance\n\nAdding to the confusion, three of the performers, including choir conductor Faith Nasande, had previously been approved to travel to Australia in 2020 as part of an earlier tour.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, their trip was cancelled due to COVID-19 border closures.\n\n\n\n\n\nKwaYa Australia said it was particularly disheartening that students who had once been granted visas were now being refused.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking from Kampala, Uganda, Nasande told SBS that while she understood the government's decision, she hoped that it would be reconsidered given her previous approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hopefully if things go well, I'll be able to meet you guys in Australia officially. I think you're amazing people. I've known you to be amazing people from the different people I've met here in Africa, that have been to Australia before,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would request the government to just give us another chance to allow us to come share our beauty, our culture and everything. And before they know it, we shall be back to Africa.\"\n\n\n\nAlso speaking from Uganda, program manager Barnett Twesigome said the choir had been in rehearsals for two months, and that while visa applications were submitted three months ago, the government's decision came only a few days out from their flight, which is due to leave this Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The [Australian] government has been good to us so far. I will just wait for the response of the appeal, but I know they are trying to protect people from immigrating there and I know any country could easily do that,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I just want them to know that we are not that kind of people. We are a very well-established organisation and we don't want to jeopardise anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ubuntu means togetherness. So togetherness regardless of where you come from or regardless of which continent you are at. So we are together and that's what we continue to emphasise.\"\n\n\n\n",

Even if we imported migrant, skilled Labor, it takes a while for that to happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the shortage of skilled tradies like; carpenters, glaziers, plumbers and electricians is already causing delays to building projects and pushing up property prices in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the worst situation that I've come across and I've been in my own practice for 50 years. So we've had a history in Australia of benefiting from migrant construction workers... But those people now, from actually applying to move here, there is the delay, the delayed process of going through the visa application process, and then going through the accreditation that's required once they get here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Master Builders Association says 130 thousand extra workers are needed across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe building Industry lobby group says Australia\u2019s immigration and visa system is failing to attract skilled tradies or allow those already here, to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster Builders South Australia CEO Will Frogley, says many skilled tradies are already here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of them are already here, they might have a background working in construction in their home countries but they might be driving ubers or stacking shelves or working at a supermarket or petrol station - we'd like to get them working in our industry because it is causing delays the lack of labour. Also, employers are being forced to use people they perhaps wouldn't want to use, because there's not enough people around.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Australian branch has set up its own agency to help migrants find work, overcome skill gaps and gain employment in the building sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program has identified a potential local workforce of 700 international student graduates and 90 skilled migrants on permanent visas.\n\n\n\n\n\nNishriti Shetty is one of the first participants to gain employment - as a surveyor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've got three years of experience in India but that would get discounted here because it's not Australian experience, that is where I really struggled, but I think most of my skills actually come from my Indian experience. So, that kind of unconditional, or subconscious bias, didn't help me get a job.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdul Rivzi is a former immigration official.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the skilled visa process can work against would-be migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most of the people who are skilled say carpenters, joiners, bricklayers etc from outside western nations will tend to not have the English language requirements to enter Australia. How you address that is not easy but that is the big challenge in terms of attracting more constructions tradies from overseas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not clear if Labor's program to fast track 6000 tradies will be open to visa holders.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalition says it will fast track skilled visas for construction workers, but hasn't detailed how.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the campaign both parties have shied away from the debate around the details of skilled migration, instead spruiking smaller net migration targets and caps on international students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Both major parties have been at fault in terms of dressing these issues and yet the finger pointing is all we get, there's not details on what they are actually going to do.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel Hockey is 29 years old and has experienced treatment-resistant depression.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe compares living with the condition to having a flu that lasts for months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You feel lethargic. Your body feels fatigued and actually sort of aches. You might lose weight because you're not eating. You feel headachey, you feel overall sluggish and you just can't move from where you are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAround a third of people diagnosed with depression continue to experience symptoms despite trying multiple medications.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel says he felt incredibly disappointed after years of looking for different treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trialling different medications and different sort of therapies and treatments, nothing was really sticking and nothing -- it might improve slightly but then it would plateau or it would slide back and for me personally you just felt incredibly disheartened.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a new drug is bringing hope and from Thursday, it will be made will be made more affordable for up to 30,000 Australians through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe medication is Spravato, known chemically as esketamine and it's a chemical cousin of ketamine, which is used as a powerful anaesthetic as well as an illicit recreational drug.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel has been one of a small number of patients who have been using the medication under a special access scheme and currently takes the drug once a fortnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it has been life-changing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For me it knocks out half a day but I sort of wouldn't even see it as knocking out half a day, it's sort of a half a day of investment in the next 14 days of wellness and being able to show up for work on time, complete tasks, interact socially, get out and experience the sun, you know all those tiny daily tasks that you often take for granted when things are going smoothly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe listing of the drug is the first new government-backed initiative to treat depression in decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will reduce the cost of Spravato from around $800 for a single dose to $31.60 or $7.70 for pensioners and concession card holders.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister for Health and Aged Care Mark Butler says the listing would make the novel drug more affordable and improve quality of life for thousands of Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Ian Hickie, co-director of Health and Policy at the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre, says it's a positive step for many people living with depression, which can have broad and serious impacts on a person's life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Severe depression interferes with a person's capacity to live their life. Whether that's in education, whether that's in training, whether that's in employment. So, the productivity costs associated with depression, the productivity losses, are very significant. Additionally the impact on people's relationships is high. And of course what we also see are complications -- drug and alcohol abuse, other sets of problems medically and then of course we have the risk of suicide and self harm. So, we lose lives prematurely through physical health complications and through suicide, accident and injury.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Hickie says there have been few pharmaceutical innovations for depression in recent years but Spravoto works very differently to other antidepressants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Largely, in fact over the last 60 years, most antidepressants have focused on one of the common monoamines: serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine. This has a different chemical target: glutamate in the brain, so it's different and it's the first drug to be supported by the PBS that is fundamentally different from all of those other compounds, which have focused on the traditional monoamines.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile other antidepressants may take weeks or months to work, Spravato is fast-acting.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany leading psychiatrists and researchers have been advocating for the government subsidy for esketamine for several years.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Colleen Loo from the Black Dog Institute says there has been mounting evidence for ketamine's treatment of severe depression for around two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the early studies coming out of the US, so they showed that even people who had trialled four or more medications and for some people, even electroconvulsive therapy, which up to that point and up to now has really been the gold-standard treatment for severe and treatement-resistant depression and suicidality, that even for people who had failed to get better with all of those treatments, something like about half of people were getting a good response to ketamine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Loo says one way ketamine appears to work is by allowing people with depression to break out of thought patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It causes a profound change in your brain function at a whole of brain level. A simple analogy of this has been like rebooting a computer. We do know that when people are depressed, many people will say 'It's like my brain has become stuck, like a broken record.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile other psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin or magic mushrooms and MDMA, otherwise known as ecstasy, can have similar effects, Professor Loo says ketamine and esketamine are easier for many patients to take because they don't require patients to come off other medications before using them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the cost of Spravato itself has now been significantly reduced, there are still significant costs associated with the administration of the medication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Loo says administration of the drug requires a team of practitioners and around two hours in a clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's the big part of the equation that still makes ketamine difficult to afford for many people. We've already had an affordable drug -- the generic version, the PBS now brings the other formulation of ketamine into the affordable range but for both forms of ketamine, the clinic treatment costs haven't been covered by the government. What we really need is Medicare funding for the clinic treatment cost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Hockey agrees that while the listing of Spravato on the PBS is a first step, he wants to see the administration of the medication become more accessible.\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / LUKAS COCH An extra $6.4 billion will come from reducing spending on consultants, contractors, and labour hire, as well as non-wage expenses such as travel, hospitality, and property.\n\n\n\n\n\nGallagher said unlike the Coalition's pledge to cut 41,000 public job s, these savings would not impact any services or programs that the Australian Public Service provides.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative budget deficit will reduce from $151.6 billion to $150.5 billion as a result of the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will help to cover Labor's $1,000 instant tax deduction for work expenses, which is estimated to cost the budget $2.4 billion over forward estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nGallagher said Labor had managed to get \"rid of a lot of waste and rorts\" embedded in previous budgets, which have been redirected to cost of living measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We returned that money to budget, and it allowed us to ... deliver through our budgets \u2014 our investments in Medicare, our investments in housing, the income tax cuts, and other measures like lowering HECS debt,\" she said.\n\n\n\nTreasurer challenges Coalition to 'come clean' on cuts\n\nChalmers has urged the Coalition to \"come clean\" with its figures, letting voters know the cost of its policies as well as what it intends to cut to cover the spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We call on the Coalition to release their costs and cuts immediately,\" Chalmers said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is long past time for the Coalition to come clean on their secret cuts to pay for their nuclear reactors.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Labor was the only party with a \"costed, coherent, and credible plan\" for voters.\n\n\n\nDeputy Opposition leader Sussan Ley defended the timeframe last week, stating the Coalition's costings would be published in time to be \"fully interrogated\" ahead of election day.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, with more than two million early voters already having cast their ballots, many will head into polling booths without the figures on hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

It got to the point where she struggled to walk to the front door, let alone leave the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was that depressed that my body was experiencing such horrible physical symptoms due to my deteriorating mental health,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHutcheon went through years of trying oral antidepressants with limited to no success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some of them worked for a little bit, and then they didn't, and some of the side effects weren't something that I could handle, like no sleeping,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If it doesn't work, you get this feeling like you want to give up, or you feel like it's your fault.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Allan says no depression treatments worked for him.

    "text": "On Wall Street overnight, stocks drifted to a mixed finish on Monday, ahead of potential flashpoints later this week that could bring more sharp swings for financial markets. The S&P 500 inched up by 0.1 per cent to extend its winning streak to a fifth day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1 per cent.\n\nEndeavour shares rose 0.5 per cent. The retailer and hotel owner, which runs the bottle shop chains Dan Murphy\u2019s and BWS, said this morning that former Virgin chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka will become its new boss from January 1, with executive chairman Ari Mervis continuing in his role until then.\n\nAustralia\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, Woodside, edged up 0.1 per cent after making its final investment decision on a $17.5 billion ($27.4 billion) liquefied natural gas export project in the US, cementing its position as a top supplier of the fuel. The approval clears the way for large-scale construction of the Louisiana LNG export plant, which is targeting its first shipment in 2029, Woodside said.\n\nThe relative lull in trading offered a respite from the sharp, historic swings that have rocked markets for weeks, as hopes rose and fell that President Donald Trump may back down on his trade war. Many investors believe Trump\u2019s tariffs could cause a recession if left unaltered. Coming into Monday, the S&P 500 had roughly halved its drop that had taken it nearly 20 per cent below its record set earlier this year.\n\nYet with a jittery April near its close, several market pros see little reason to think volatility is in the rearview mirror. For sharemarkets to keep rising, investors would need to see Donald Trump\u2019s White House follow through on the \u201cdovish pivot\u201d toward trade with China, according to Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n\nMixed trading for some influential tech stocks ahead of their earnings reports this week pulled the S&P 500 back and forth between modest gains and losses for much of the session overnight.\n\nAmazon fell 0.7 per cent, Microsoft dipped 0.2 per cent, Meta Platforms added 0.4 per cent, and Apple rose 0.4 per cent. All are set to report their latest result this week, and they\u2019re some of Wall Street\u2019s most influential companies because they\u2019ve grown to become some of the biggest in terms of size, by far. That gives their movements extra weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nOutside of big tech, executives from Caterpillar, ExxonMobil, and McDonald\u2019s may also offer clues this week about how they\u2019re seeing economic conditions play out. Several companies across various industries have already slashed their estimates for upcoming profits or pulled their forecasts entirely due to uncertainty about what will happen with Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

    "text": "A video aired on Channel Nine\u2019s flagship morning show Today, featuring hosts laughing at a kangaroo being harassed by a large dog, has sparked frustration among native animal lovers. Experts have dubbed the response to the clip \u201ccareless\u201d, arguing it highlights a wider misconception many Aussies have about wild animals interacting with domestic pets.\n\nAs the short clip is played, the Sydney-based team describe the native marsupial as \u201cvery menacing\u201d and joke that its encounter with a dog is \u201cthe most Australian thing\u201d. But further south in Melbourne, where the incident occurred, locals fear the kangaroo could have been serious injured by the attack.\n\nThe kangaroo in the video is beloved by a large community southeast of Melbourne, where he\u2019s been affectionately named Nigel.\n\n\u201cNigel is a very gentle kangaroo. I\u2019ve known that kangaroo for four years and I know his movements, but I can\u2019t find him,\u201d local shelter operator Sue Johnson told Yahoo News.\n\nDetail in alternative video sparks concern for kangaroo\n\nDespite ongoing searches, Nigel hasn\u2019t been seen since the incident occurred a week ago, sparking concern around the southeast suburb of Rowville. And some residents are upset at the tone of the morning TV segment on Monday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt was upsetting the way Today handled it. When something like this happens, and they think it\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s not on,\u201d Sue said.\n\nShe has reviewed alternative footage of the incident and noticed tiny signs in the animal\u2019s behaviour that indicate he could now be suffering from myopathy, a marsupial disease that\u2019s induced by stress and causes a long, painful death.\n\n\u201cIn the other video, once the dog has gone, he stands up to turn around and his right leg is swivelling. And it shouldn't be doing that,\u201d she told Yahoo.\n\nNigel the kangaroo hasn't been seen since the incident occurred on April 22. Source: Supplied\n\nDetail in kangaroo clip sparks online backlash\n\nDuring the segment, the Today team make it clear they don\u2019t know what happened to the kangaroo, or where it occurred, suggesting it could be Canberra or Melbourne.\n\nAfter Today posted the clip to Instagram yesterday, it attracted hundreds of comments, with many animal lovers around Australia also taking umbrage with the tone of the video. \u201cEveryone forgets that poor roo is simply trying to protect himself,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cThis ain\u2019t funny,\u201d another said. \u201cThis is not cool at all,\u201d another commented.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOthers questioned why the dog wasn\u2019t on a leash. \u201cThis is absolutely stupid \u2013 where is the owner of the dog?\u201d one person said. Meanwhile some expressed concern for the dog's welfare, saying; \u201cThat ain\u2019t funny, that dog is lucky to be alive.\u201d\n\nToday declined to comment on the community response to its segment.\n\nExperts reveal why kangaroo video is 'quite worrying'\n\nThe clip was clearly aired without malice, and experts in kangaroo behaviour believe it was simply \u201ccareless\u201d. They argue the television show\u2019s response to the clip indicates a wider issue of Australians misunderstanding how damaging the harassment of kangaroos by dogs is. Some also don\u2019t realise that large kangaroos can kill dogs if they fear for their lives.\n\nDeakin University wildlife ecology expert Professor Euan Ritchie described the video as \u201cdistressing\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe owner of the dog may not realise their dog is in serious risk of being harmed by the kangaroo. Large males are very powerful animals with long sharp claws and powerful feet and are quite capable of killing a dog,\u201d he told Yahoo.\n\n\u201cOf course, there\u2019s also the possibility that the dog will harm the kangaroo, which is of course protected native wildlife. And then on top of that, there are pedestrians and drivers in the vicinity of the panicked kangaroo and it could potentially hit a car or bystander.\n\n\u201cReally the whole situation is quite worrying and problematic, and certainly nothing to make a joke about.\u201d\n\nFear kangaroos could be driven from suburbs\n\nKangaroo expert and documentary maker Mick McIntyre said people in Rowville are lucky to have wildlife in their community, but more \u201ccommon sense\u201d is needed. If dogs aren\u2019t kept on leashes kangaroos will be forced out as they see dogs as predators.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen you see a wild kangaroo, give it space, do not harass it,\u201d he told Yahoo.\n\n\u201cThe TV commentary made much hilarity. But imagine if that dog had been injured by the kangaroo, their commentary [could] have changed very quickly, blaming the kangaroo. The kangaroo is our national icon and deserves our care and respect.\u201d\n\nAlyssa Wormald who founded the Victorian Kangaroo Association, said in 2025, Australians need to move away from laughing at animals being \u201cattacked\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is presented as a titillating story, but really it is just desperately sad. Not only has this magnificent kangaroo been displaced by suburbia, he is fighting for his life against a dog,\u201d she told Yahoo.\n\nVictorian shelter operator Helen Round is also concerned about the longterm welfare of the kangaroo.\n\n\u201cOne bite is all it takes. The kangaroo [now could face] a slow, agonising death,\u201d she said.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

Trump has said he is in a much stronger position this time, suggesting to The Atlantic he's the most powerful person in the world. \u201cThe first time, I had two things to do \u2014 run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys,\" he said. \u201cAnd the second time, I run the country and the world.\u201d\n\nDutton hoping for election 'surprise' And sticking with Peter Dutton, the Opposition leader has stressed he's still got a great chance of winning the federal election despite falling behind in the polls. \"There's a lot of quiet Australians ... particularly people in suburbs, who believe that the government hasn't delivered for them,\" he told Brisbane radio station 4BC. \"I think there are a few surprises coming and there's no doubt in my mind that we can win this election.\" Earlier in the campaign Prime Minister Anthony Albanese himself said the election was far from over, pointing to the 2019 federal election when Scott Morrison claimed an unlikely election victory.\n\nPeter Dutton's office vandalised again Peter Dutton\u2019s electorate office in Brisbane has been vandalised for a third time in the election campaign. The office building in Arana Hills in Brisbane\u2019s north was splashed with red paint and covered in signs, condemning the Opposition Leader on Gaza and other issues overnight. One flyer read: \u201cDutton says he can find \u2018common ground\u2019 with Trump and praises the US interference with Gaza.\u201d Another said: \u201cDutton opposes tertiary education funding and public housing initiatives but used 6k of taxpayers\u2019 money for company at Gina Rinehart\u2019s birthday party.\u201d The incident follows recent comments from the Opposition Leader on the Welcome to Country being \u201coverdone\u201d and attacks on the Greens for being anti-Semitic and \u201cJew haters\u201d. While Dutton said Welcome to Country should reserved for important events, such as the opening of parliament, it should be respected if held. Peter Dutton's office has once again been vandalised.

But the NSW government has set the record straight, and you don't even need to press the button sometimes. That's because doing so in Sydney CBD between 6am and 10am, it won't make a difference as its automated at that time, NSW Road Safety says. \"Outside these hours in the CBD and at all times everywhere else in NSW, pushing the button once alerts the traffic system to clear traffic and turn the signal green,\" it said. And for pressing repeatedly? Well that's a waste of time. \"Pressing more than once won't speed this up.\"\n\nQ+A clash for Liberal and Labor MPs Debate over the appropriate place of Welcome to Country ceremonies threw the ABC\u2019s flagship Q and A program into acrimony on Monday night, with accusations of \u201cgutter politics\u201d and \u201cstraw man\u201d arguments quickly emerging in the heated exchanges between panellists. Audience member Peter asked how the debate around the ceremonies could be resolved \u201camicably\u201d and \u201cin the interest of all parties concerned\u201d following days of campaign trail division between Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton on the matter. Liberal MP Paul Fletcher said the country needed to recognise the \u201cdistinctive place\u201d of Indigenous Australians but suggested many across society felt there were now too many ceremonies. The issue has escalated in the federal election after neo Nazis booed a Welcome to Country from Bunurong man Uncle Mark Brown at Melbourne\u2019s Anzac Day Dawn Service at the Shrine of Remembrance. Tanya Plibersek and Paul Fletcher battled on the ABC\u2019s flagship Q and A program on Monday night. Picture: ABC Both sides of politics reacted with anger to the scenes and condemned the disruptive behaviour. But Mr Dutton has since said the ceremonies were losing their significance because of overuse and has suggested they might not be appropriate for Anzac Day services. On Monday night, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek backed the ceremonies on Anzac Day and said acknowledging the service of Indigenous Australians in the military was \u201cperfectly appropriate\u201d. Mr Fletcher said veterans should determine the matter. When Ms Plibersek shot back and said he was speaking as though \u201cwe don\u2019t have Indigenous veterans\u201d, Mr Fletcher accused her of deploying \u201cstraw man rhetoric\u201d, or suggesting she was not engaging directly with his position. \u201cI can tell you the role of Indigenous people in defending Australia over many conflicts has been very significant,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody is contesting that for a second.\u201d Read more from NCA NewsWire here.\n\nLiberals welcome volunteers from 'all religions' Liberal senator James Paterson says he isn't concerned by reports hundreds of members of a controversial breakaway Christian church are campaigning for the Coalition \"undercover\". The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, formerly known as the Exclusive Brethren, has allegedly instructed members to attend polling booths in marginal seats in a bid to influence voters, The Age reported. However the church denied to the publication it has instructed such a co-ordinated strategy. Paterson rejected suggestion from ABC Breakfast host Bridget Brennan more should be done to vet volunteers. \"I think that would be an extraordinary thing in a country that has no official state religion, that has freedom of religion, that we would say that some people are not welcome to participate in the political process because of their beliefs,\" he said. \"If you support our agenda, you're welcome to assist our campaign.\"\n\nThousands impacted by Telstra outage Well this is not the news you want if you're a Telstra customer. The telco has addressed concerns after thousands of customers were hit with a huge outage on Monday. The problems first arose around 2pm AEST, with a few simmering complaints being reported to DownDetector. However, that exploded to nearly 2,300 reports three hours later, with the majority of issues concentrating around email logins and certain apps. Telstra revealed on Monday night it was trying to rectify the issue. \"Our team's on it, and we hope to have you back in your inbox soon. Using an app to access your mailbox (Outlook) may help in the meantime,\" the company said. The telco revealed on Tuesday morning that while the issue has been rectified for some, others are still facing problems with Telstra Mail. \"Our team's continuing to monitor and investigate,\" it said.

Source: Reddit/mommypaste\n\nA luminous For Sale sign erected outside an Aussie home has quietly perturbed neighbours due to the bright light it emits every night, causing a disturbance in the usually quiet residential street.\n\nLocal man Richard, who asked to only be identified by his first name, told Yahoo News the sign was switched on in front of the property on View Street in Annandale, Sydney by real estate agency McGrath Lower North Shore. He claims the the street was suddenly illuminated every night thanks to its solar-powered light.\n\n\"I think the light is completely unnecessary and pointless,\" he told Yahoo News. \"The sign is behind a large tree and shrub. It is a quiet neighbourhood road. No potential buyers are going to see it.\"\n\nRichard believes the intention of having a readable sign at night is already lost due to it being blocked by the tree and shrub, so the light is simply a nuisance that \"disturbs local residents and wildlife\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It's another form of light pollution,\" he complained.\n\nAfter sharing a picture of the sign online, other Aussies shared their disdain for the practice.\n\n\"I've seen this once before in person and it was ridiculously bright! I immediately felt sorry for the person living across the street,\" one person wrote.\n\nOne recent home seller said they had one of the bright signs outside their property and even admitted they found it \"annoying\".\n\nOthers called the use of these signs \"obtrusive\" and \"unnecessary\" and questioned how many prospective homebuyers are \"house-hunting after dark\" to make the use of the signs worthwhile.\n\nReal estate agency defends use of bright sign\n\nMcGrath Estate Agents told Yahoo News the solar-powered signs are not in breach of any marketing laws set out for real estate agents and they are simply used to help drive interest for their clients.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"As property agents, our aim is to find buyers for the properties we market. A part of the marketing strategy is to provide signboards alerting passersby that the property is for sale,\" Rachel Maher, Chief Operating Officer of McGrath Lower North Shore told Yahoo.\n\n\"We use standard sized signboards and illuminate them to draw attention to the property and make the details legible at night.\"\n\nHowever following the complaint from the neighbour, Maher confirmed the sign in question will be removed as the agency doesn't want to cause a disturbance to residents.\n\n\"Following the neighbour's request, we will remove the illumination. Our signboard company will remove the lighting tomorrow, Tuesday April 29,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
