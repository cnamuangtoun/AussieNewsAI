    "text": "The chairman and CEO of embattled telco Optus have been grilled at a Senate inquiry into the catastrophic triple-zero failure that left three people dead.\n\nHuman error during a firewall upgrade in September led to an outage in multiple states and territories, which led to customers being unable to call the emergency line.\n\nSpeaking at a Senate inquiry today, Optus CEO Stephen Rue admitted the mistakes made by the telco during and immediately after the outage.\n\nStephen Rue admitted \"there were mistakes made\" by the company during and after the outage. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\n\"There is no doubt that the timeline shows there were delays, there were mistakes made,\" he said.\n\n\"The tragic deaths of people during this outage stay with us as individuals and as a company as we investigate the incident.\n\n\"I fully accept there are aspects to the way events unfolded and how they were communicated over September 18 and 19 that we should have handled better.\"\n\nRue said correct steps and procedures were not followed after the company became aware of the outage and admitted that despite the offshore call centre believing the network hadn't failed, the issue should have been escalated.\n\n\"This was a unique situation whereby the call centre people believed the network was not failing, but they should have escalated those calls,\" Rue said.\n\n\"The initial mistake, a human error, occurred when the wrong process plan was selected for a routine firewall upgrade.\n\n\"The selected plan did not divert traffic before locking equipment inside the exchange that routes triple-zero calls.\n\n\"This error was not detected because control steps were not followed and alarms were not acted on at the time.\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Former prince Andrew to lose final military title\n\nOptus CEO Stephen Rue speaks to the media in the days after the outage. The company has been criticised for being slow to report how many people were impacted by the outage. (Sitthixay Ditthavong)\n\nRue insisted this was \"an explanation, not an excuse\".\n\nHe also insisted the company had not been misleading in its delay in confirming how many calls were impacted in the outage.\n\n\"I wouldn't characterise it as misleading, it was information as we knew it at the time,\" he said.\n\n\"Sadly, it turned out to be different, we accept that.\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Shock CCTV shows moment man is snatched off the street in Sydney\n\nThe outage is one of many high-profile incidents to hit the company in recent years. (Getty)\n\nThe fallout has been disastrous for Optus, with the triple-zero failure the latest in a long line of incidents and issues at the company over the last three years.\n\nRue, who came into the company in 2023 after previous CEO Kelly Rosmarin resigned in the wake of a nationwide outage, is also under increased pressure to keep his job.\n\nTwo Optus executives have already announced their departure,\ufeff but Rue received an endorsement from Optus chairman John Arthur.\n\n\"There were I think 10 failures here, 10 failures. And if you're asking me whether I am alarmed at that, I can assure you I am,\" he said.\n\n\"However, this man was brought into this company to make sure we became a company that didn't have 10 failures like that.\n\n\"Now that's his job, and I'm expecting him to finish it.\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff The concerning factor believed to be behind surging house prices\n\nOptus chairman John Arthur insisted Stephen Rue was the right man for the role of CEO. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nRue said it was not the right time for him to step away from the company.\n\n\"I firmly believe that another change of leader at this time is not what Optus needs, or what our customers need,\" he said.\n\nOptus has been criticised for having critical infrastructure and call centres located offshore, and Rue said the company had made changes as a result of the triple-zero failure.\n\n\"We will take back calls that relate to triple-zero calls and relate to vulnerable customers\u2026 and ensure that they are dealt with onshore in Australia. And we're in the process of doing exactly that,\" he said.\n\n\"Our contact centre procedures have been overhauled, including a mandatory escalation process for any customer reports of triple-zero issues.\"",

(ABC News: Kimberley Putland)\n\nMr Hightower said shifting the project closer to the centre would \"deliver all the aspirations of the community\" in activating the town centre.\n\n\"Where it's ended up and been approved really limits the ability for that to occur at all,\" he said.\n\nMr Hightower said the community understood the need for workforce accommodation, but the development's social impact survey highlighted concerns.\n\n\"There was an overwhelming perception that this development would have negative impacts \u2026 there were references to the location being inadequate within those surveys,\" he said.\n\nPort and South Hedland face ongoing short-term accommodation shortages. (ABC News: Kimberley Putland)\n\nA 'wait and see' approach\n\nTown of Port Hedland Commissioners Jessica Shaw and Ron Yuryevich sat on the panel and voted to approve the development.\n\nMs Shaw disagrees with Mr Hightower.\n\n\"When we considered all the planning principles \u2014 which you're required to as a DAP member \u2014 we determined that it was consistent and that it would be a good development for the town,\" she told ABC Pilbara Kimberley Mornings.\n\n\"It's a significant investment into Port Hedland.\n\n\"It will alleviate a lot of those housing issues, both for temporary workers and for permanent housing and so, yes, we did support the project.\"\n\nRon Yuryevich (left) and Jessica Shaw (right) were on the Development Assessment Panel. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nWhile not a condition of approval, the proponent agreed to make a voluntary contribution of $2.5 million every 10 years to the Town of Port Hedland.\n\nMs Shaw said she and Mr Yuryevich argued for the contributions to be a condition of approval, but they were outvoted.\n\nThe estimated lifespan of the development is 40 years, valuing the deal at $10 million.\n\nHedland First National Real Estate general manager Scott Lowe said the benefit of the development might be to ease housing shortages in the town.\n\nScott Lowe says the development could be a \"net positive\" for the community. (ABC News: Rachel Pupazzoni)\n\n\"Our preference would always be to see investment into permanent residential accommodation,\" he said.\n\n\"This facility might actually support that, in that if some of the occupants currently housed in permanent housing moved into it, then it frees up some accommodation in town for families or permanent residents to move into town.\n\n\" It's a 'wait and see' approach I guess because it could be net positive. \"\n\nWater Corporation 'confident' it can work with developer\n\nPort Hedland's water supply constraint was raised by both Mr Hightower and Ms Shaw.\n\nThe applicant said Water Corporation had not flagged any issues with supply.\n\nA Water Corporation spokesperson told the ABC that it was waiting for further information since providing advice last year.\n\n\"Once this is received, we are confident of being able to work with the developer to support the proposal in a staged and orderly way,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe ABC understands the development plan is expected to go before the Town of Port Hedland for approval in the coming months.",

    "text": "A popular hiking trail in WA's Stirling Range National Park has seen a fourfold increase in the number of hikers being rescued so far this year, with rescuers saying a spike in visitors is the cause.\n\nThe Range, about 337 kilometres south-east of Perth, is a popular destination for hikers and tourists.\n\nOfficial figures show more than 50,000 people summit Bluff Knoll each year, but emergency services said there had been a steady rise in numbers, precipitating a spike in those needing a rescue.\n\nAt 1,099m, Bluff Knoll is southern WA's highest peak. (Supplied)\n\nRescues increase\n\nThe Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) said rescue crews had been called to 12 incidents so far this year, up from the three for the same time last year.\n\nA total of four people were rescued in 2024.\n\nLast month, three people were airlifted or brought down by emergency services in three separate incidents.\n\nEarlier in the year, an injured rock climber who spent more than 24 hours on the side of the bluff was winched off the peak in a massive rescue operation.\n\nThis year, a man became stuck in a more isolated part of the bluff favoured by rock climbers. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nDFES deputy commissioner operations Craig Waters said on average, 25 people from several emergency services were involved in each rescue.\n\nHe said the average rescue took up to eight hours, but complex conditions often meant some took longer.\n\n\"Severe weather can make rescues difficult, particularly on a summit like Bluff Knoll where volunteers need to hike the steep ascent with heavy equipment to get to injured or stranded people in the heat, wind or rain,\" he said.\n\n\"Aircraft, including the RAC Rescue helicopter, can be used to retrieve injured or stranded hikers but volatile weather means it cannot always safely carry out the rescue.\"\n\nMr Waters said the rescues were a reminder for hikers not to underestimate the state's more challenging tracks.\n\nGnowangerup and Albany State Emergency Services respond to rescues on the mountain. (Supplied: SES)\n\nMore people on the bluff\n\nGnowangerup SES manager Peter Blows, a regular first responder to the range, said the spike was due to more people visiting the national park.\n\n\"We just seem to be getting more and more calls down there, but I think that's to do with the number of people now that are discovering our lovely area,\" he said.\n\n\"Most people we've rescued or all of them have had all the gear \u2026 just if it gets too hot, they are down a little bit on water.\"\n\nAt work on the cliffs of Dyurrite/Mt Arapiles. (Supplied: SES)\n\nAustralia's peak body for bushwalking said the popularisation of wilderness hiking on social media had contributed to a rise in rescues across some of the country's top hiking trails.\n\n\"Bushwalking has become quite popular, especially in the social media groups where people get together casually and somebody says, 'Let's go to such and such an area' and then they turn up and shoot off for a walk,\" said Bushwalking Australia president Jeff McDonell.\n\n\"That's an issue for us because often the leaders aren't trained, and they may not have the navigation skills, and people are getting lost.\n\n\"Unfortunately, [rescues] have increased because of that.\"\n\nJeff McDonell says inexperience and lack of preparation can contribute to emergencies. (Supplied)\n\nInexperience to blame\n\nMr McDonell said while even experienced hikers could have accidents, rescues were often due to inexperience and lack of preparation.\n\n\"Bushwalking clubs are very well organised, they have trained leaders, they have first aid, they stick to the rules \u2026 never walk alone, always walk with groups, take a personal locator beacon (PLB), and if the weather turns bad, turn back,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got an area, Lederderg Gorge, which is only about an hour from Melbourne, and the SES have had to do several rescues recently.\n\n\"They've rescued a group of 25 people who went for a day walk and got lost, didn't have any light and got lost in the dark.\"\n\nSome state parks now lend out personal locator beacons. (Supplied: SES)\n\nIn July, two hikers were rescued from the Larapinta Trail in the Northern Territory in one week, while last month in Tasmania, police found the body of a missing hiker in Mount Field National Park.\n\nMr McDonell said in NSW, hikers on Mt Kosciusko and in the Blue Mountains could borrow PLBs for the duration of their walks.\n\nHe said that initiative could be expanded more widely.\n\n\"I think there's a role for the national parks to take a more proactive role,\" he said.\n\n\"In NSW, parks are loaning out PLBs for free, and we were looking at that in Victoria.\"",

    "text": "Sam Kerr is back among the goals \u2014 and Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor believes her typical quality finish in the Women's Super League was just the boost of confidence the great striker needs on the comeback trail.\n\nThe Matildas captain has had a lean time in front of goal since her return in mid-September. She had netted on her return from injury against Aston Villa but then failed to score in eight games for club and country while mainly getting late cameo appearances off the bench.\n\nThat super-sub role remained on Sunday morning (AEST) when Kerr was brought on at Stamford Bridge for the last quarter of an hour against London City Lionesses, replacing fellow Matilda Ellie Carpenter, who had earlier scored her first goal for the club to put them ahead.\n\nKerr had a bright spell of nearly 20 minutes but again without a goal until the 94th, when the ball fell kindly to her off a defender and, quick as flash, she directed a superbly controlled chip from an unpromising angle over the retreating goalkeeper to seal the 2-0 win.\n\nHer first goal at Stamford Bridge in nearly two years thrilled Kerr but perhaps enthused the club's French manager equally.\n\n\"I'm really pleased for Sam, she's been building up her minutes,\" Bompastor said.\n\n\"She was able to play more minutes with the national team, and she's getting back to a good level.\n\n\"She came in and made an impact on the game. She got a crucial goal for the team and her goal meant the game was over, even if it was in added time.\n\n\"It was nice for her, for her confidence and also for the team. Hopefully, we'll see Sam taking even more steps to get closer to her best level.\"\n\nIt was a big afternoon for Carpenter, too, who not only scored her first goal since her move from French giants Lyonnes but also thrived as the player of the match in a new wing-back rather than full-back role.\n\nThe change of shape meant their other right-back, Lucy Bronze, worked behind Carpenter, and the pair teamed up seamlessly to provide more of a threat down the flank, with the Aussie scoring after just 5 minutes.\n\n\"It was good. Both of them had good performances. I think they made a big impact on the game,\" Bompastor said of Carpenter and star England international Bronze.\n\n\"Ellie also had a really good performance. She was able to score a really important and early goal in the game.\"\n\nChampions Chelsea are one point clear of Manchester City, while Manchester United also kept close, just a further point behind after they won 3-2 at Dario Vidosic's Brighton on Sunday.\n\nElisabeth Terland fired United ahead and Jess Park made it two after the break, but the Seagulls threatened a comeback when Fran Kirby struck.\n\nPark then provided the assist for Lisa Naalsund in the 89th minute and United held on after Kiko Seike scored in stoppage time as Brighton, now seventh, slipped to a third straight defeat.\n\nTottenham are fourth after beating struggling Liverpool 2-1 with a Beth England winner, while Matildas Caitlin Foord and Steph Catley both impressed in Arsenal's 4-1 win at Leicester, where Stina Blackstenius scored twice.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "A weary Kimberly Birrell has missed out on winning her maiden WTA title after losing the Chennai Open final \u2014 but the Australian earned the consolation of a special sportsmanship award for her selfless behaviour at the Indian tournament.\n\nGold Coast player Birrell was defeated 6-4, 6-3 by rising Indonesian player Janice Tjen in the final \u2014 a bitter disappointment as it was her second defeat in a championship match in Asia after also losing the Osaka final last year.\n\nBut seventh seed Birrell clearly was not at her sharpest after battling through an exhausting semifinal 24 hours earlier against Taiwan's Joanna Garland, in which the courageous Australian battled back from 5-0 down in the final set and saved five match points on the way to victory in 3 hours, 24 minutes.\n\nStill, it was not just Birrell's never-say-die performance in the longest match of her career that caught the admiration of organisers so much as her admirable concern for beaten opponent Garland, who struggled with the effects of cramp and injury when on the verge of victory.\n\nAt one point, slumping with illness at the back of the court, Garland needed medical treatment, leaving the Aussie showing concern for her condition.\n\nThen, once Birrell finally prevailed, she was more interested in hugging and consoling her vanquished opponent than revelling in one of the key breakthrough moments in her career.\n\n\"She's a great player and a great person too \u2014 we have a friendship off the court and you have to put that aside,\" Birrell said of Garland.\n\n\"When your opponent and a friend is struggling like that, it's really hard to concentrate and to focus. That was not fun at all, the last few games.\"\n\nUltimately, Birrell ended in tears herself, after then being presented with the tournament's Margaret Amritraj Fairplay Award for her display of sportsmanship.\n\nThe award is named in honour of the mother of Indian tennis great Vijay Amritraj, who told Birrell: \"This is named after my mum for fair play, and I thought this match was truly one of those matches.\"\n\nThe final, though, again proved too much for the 27-year-old Birrell as she went down to fourth seed Tjen, getting her serve broken five times in all during the 2-hour duel.\n\nThe disappointment for world number 117 Birrell was tempered by how her run to the final would take her back into the world's top 100 this week at number 94.\n\nThe top Australian woman in the rankings back at the start of the year, she had dropped to number five, but will rise one place after her big week.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Hong Kong Open final, young Canadian star Victoria Mboko managed to achieve what had just eluded another rising teen, Australian Maya Joint, in the semifinal as she overcame Spain's Cristina Bucsa for a 7-5, 6-7 (9-11), 6-2 triumph.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "Johanna Murphy spent a decade honing her specialist skills as a sports physiotherapist, but a childcare drought in her south-western New South Wales town means she can only work one day per week.\n\nThe mum of three is currently unable to take new patients and said this had a profound flow-on effect on the entire town.\n\n\"The perfect example would be: you wake up one morning and you can't move your head because your neck\u2019s locked up. If you can't get in to see the physio to begin treatment, you can't sit at your desk because it's too sore,\" Ms Murphy said.\n\n\"People then can't do their job and if they're not doing their work, their colleagues take the load or the work just doesn't get done.\n\n\" I think if you asked everyone in town, they would be able to track an issue with access back to someone not being able to access childcare. \"\n\nJohanna Murphy only works one day per week in her private physiotherapy practice because she cannot get child care. (Supplied: Johanna Murphy)\n\nResidents leaving, jobs unfilled\n\nThe Edward River Council has collated data that shows 69 per cent of local children currently do not have access to a childcare place, with waitlists for local services exceeding 300 families.\n\nThe situation was further exacerbated in July when a local centre closed suddenly due to compliance issues, leaving nearly 30 families without care.\n\nMayor Ashley Hall said the council was working with an early education provider to establish a new 110-place daycare centre, but conceded it was still years away.\n\nThere is a shortage of daycare services in Deniliquin. (Supplied: River Region Early Education)\n\n\"It's the number one advocacy role that council are playing at the moment,\" Cr Hall said.\n\n\"We've got tremendous support from our community, but we need outside help, particularly for capital funding from the state and federal government.\"\n\nRiver Region Early Education provides daycare services in Deniliquin and surrounding rural communities.\n\nGeneral manager Felicity Michael said families were leaving the region and essential worker roles were hard to fill because of the shortage.\n\nFelicity Michael says essential workers are not coming to the region due to a lack of child care. (Supplied: Felicity Michael)\n\n\"We know of two teachers who have had to leave teaching positions in Deniliquin due to a lack of care for their children, and nurses unable to take up positions at the hospital due to the lack of childcare,\" she said.\n\nMs Michael said data from the Australian Early Development Census also highlighted a concerning trend.\n\n\"It is impacting the development of children, with more children in Deniliquin being developmentally vulnerable in two or more domains than the NSW or national average,\" she said.\n\n\"Children who are able to access early childhood education and care are more likely to be able to access early intervention [that will] set them up for a bright future. The lack of childcare is limiting these children's access to this vital early intervention.\"\n\nThe NSW Department of Education says the state government will deliver a new pre-school at Deniliquin South Public School by 2027. (Supplied: River Region Early Education)\n\nA town on tenterhooks\n\nEdward River Council had been in discussions with the NSW Education Department on establishing a temporary daycare centre at a local public school, but the proposal has stalled.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said the department was working with local stakeholders to identify a solution for the short term.\n\nThey said the state government would deliver five new pre-schools in the wider Riverina region by 2027, including one at Deniliquin South Public School.\n\nFor now, though, Johanna Murphy said tensions were running high in town.\n\n\"My receptionist at work is getting some pretty unhappy clients calling who are trying to get in to see a physio and can't,\" she said.\n\n\"The poor admin staff at the childcare centres \u2026 there are people calling every single day to check in again, 'Am I further up the waitlist, am I any closer to getting childcare?' They\u2019re getting families in tears in their waiting room.\n\n\"It is dire straits in Deniliquin and we need a solution as soon as possible.\"",

But I'm sure the National Party is very, very, very aware that the Liberal Party will come with its own position, informed by its own priorities and considerations,\" Smith says.\n\nLiberal senator Sarah Henderson has jumped in off the back off Smith to say that she hopes her colleagues turn their back entirely on net zero.\n\n\"I believe that we will get a position where we will work together to reject Labor's net zero laws,\" Henderson says. \"These policies are not working. Australians can see it. The National Party have called this out.\n\n\"We are very concerned to ensure that we continue to reduce emissions. But we are not going to allow Australians to pay the highest price,\" she says.\n\nHenderson says she hopes the Liberals reach a position \"as soon as possible\" and that deliberations won't continue for much longer.",

    "text": "\u201cIt seems very clear that it was more important to you and to your executive team to make sure your corporate ducks were in order, that your profits will be in order, than people\u2019s safety and transparency with government,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give any further update... even when you knew on the Thursday night that it was worse than you had previously informed the government.\u201d Pressed repeatedly on why he didn\u2019t immediately provide updated information about the true number affected or deaths, Rue insisted he \u201cwanted to provide accurate information\u201d but admitted that his call to notify the regulator came nearly 18 hours after learning of the first fatality. Rue also conceded there were delayed welfare checks on at-risk customers as engineers scrambled to manually identify failed emergency calls. In his opening statement, Rue announced that Optus would add 300 people to its Australian call centres focused on Triple Zero customers and would on-shore its network operations from offshore contractors, in response to the catastrophic network failure.\n\nHe said Optus accepted full responsibility for the failures and said he \u201cregretted reforms were not embedded earlier to prevent them\u201d. Loading \u201cWe are all deeply sorry, the tragic deaths of people during this outage will stay with us as individuals and as a company, as we investigate and build on our response while progressing a sweeping transformation of Optus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will add around 300 people to our Australian call centres focused on Triple Zero and vulnerable customers, including our specialist care teams helping customers in rural areas, elderly customers or those with serious medical conditions. \u201cIn May this year, the board approved a management proposal to take back in-house network activities currently performed by Nokia, both onshore and offshore. At the time, the aim was to transition this work progressively to May 2027, but I have now asked the networks team to accelerate the move.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the on-shoring activities in call centres and networks, we are also recruiting 150 people to be part of a new Process Centre of Excellence in Australia, to accelerate the transformation and overall procedures across the business.\u201d Loading Rue pushed back on calls for his resignation that have come from across the political spectrum. \u201cI firmly believe that another change of leader at this time is not what Optus needs or what our customers need. The disruption and uncertainty could actually set back the transformation underway and create further risks,\u201d he said. Optus chair John Arthur backed his chief executive, but promised future consequences for staff responsible for the Triple Zero outage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his job. Now, he\u2019s partway through this job and I\u2019m expecting him to finish it,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cBecause I never in my life want to be in the position I\u2019m in today where I have to answer these sorts of questions about a company I\u2019m associated with.\u201d He said once an internal Optus review, a review by the regulator, and the Senate inquiry were finalised, there would be consequences for both junior and senior staff. \u201cI can assure you that there will be [accountabilities] when the dust settles. And what I mean by that is that when we have all of the facts\u2026 the board will deal with accountabilities.\u201d The crisis stemmed from a botched firewall upgrade at Regency Park exchange in South Australia, where technicians failed to redirect traffic before locking down a critical \u201csession border gateway\u201d, according to Optus\u2019 submission to the inquiry. Optus\u2019 Paul O\u2019Sullivan, former chairman, John Arthur, chairman, and Stephen Rue, CEO, at the Triple Zero service outage hearing at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThe submission reveals Nokia contractors used an outdated procedure document and incorrectly rated the change as \u201czero risk\u201d, bypassing crucial engineering reviews. It states that Nokia personnel selected an \u201coutdated Method of Procedure (MOP) document\u201d for the change. This outdated document \u201cdid not include making changes... to \u2018offload\u2019 traffic from the Session Border Gateway\u201d before applying the lock. Loading The work was also brought forward 24 hours without proper authorisation. Automated alarms for general call failures were generated within minutes of the outage starting. Those alerts, at 12.20am on September 18, were dismissed as routine maintenance activity, while five customer calls reporting Triple Zero failures between 10.13am and 2.57pm went unescalated \u2013 a \u201cserious process issue\u201d that Optus acknowledged was unacceptable.\n\nThe outage wasn\u2019t identified until 1.17pm when South Australian Ambulance Service called Optus directly. Services were restored by 2.34pm, but the damage was done. Efforts to conduct welfare checks on affected customers were then delayed because the technical fault meant that standard Call Detail Records (CDRs) \u201cshowed no unsuccessful calls\u201d. Engineers had to devise new methods to identify affected customers, with the first 100 identified by 7.50pm \u2013 more than five hours after services were restored. A further 524 customers were identified the next morning, followed by seven more days later. Welfare checks didn\u2019t commence until 8.34pm on September 18, with Optus learning of the first fatality at 8.43pm. By Friday afternoon, three deaths had been reported, rising to four by Saturday. The company has appointed former Sydney Water chief executive Dr Kerry Schott to lead an independent review, and engaged consulting firm Kearney to oversee network management improvements. The inquiry continues.",

Access some of the best dive sites on Earth at sites nearby, such as Namena Reef, which offers some of the most diverse fish and coral species in the world. Families have free kids\u2019 club, dusk-to-dawn nanny service and a variety of activities, and couples have adults-only dining and luxury spas.\n\nLesiaceva Point Road, Savusavu; 03 9815 0379.

The most removed is Vomo Island \u2013 a private island resort at the northern end of the archipelago. There\u2019s no-one else on the island \u2013 though if you want more privacy, there\u2019s a tiny islet you can reach with a two-minute boat ride. Couples love Vomo Island\u2019s romantic restaurants and bars, but families have options with kids\u2019 clubs, water activities and kids\u2019 dining while parents escape to an adults-only restaurant.\n\nVomo Lai lai Island.

That\u2019s Outrigger Fiji Beach Resort. While it\u2019s not for everyone (couples might be advised to steer clear), this is the ultimate South Pacific family resort. There is a free kids\u2019 club, nanny services, complimentary beach activities like beach volleyball and paddle-boarding and eight bars and restaurants \u2013 but there\u2019s also adult\u2019s only restaurants and swimming pools to flee to when you drop the kids off. A multi-million revamp completed in 2023 introduced new waterslides, premium bures and upgraded recreation facilities.\n\nSydney Drive, Queens Highway, Sigatoka; +679 650 0044.

While it\u2019s home to some of Fiji\u2019s most expensive private island retreats, why not stay beside the water for less than $150 per night? Take a catamaran from Port Denarau and sleep beside your own beach, close to some of the best diving and snorkeling in Fiji.

See all stories .\n\nWith nearly 40 per cent of its population made up of those of Indian heritage, Fiji has one of the most diverse of all South Pacific cuisines. Combined with its indigenous cooking techniques and abundance of fresh produce and seafood, dining in Fiji is a big part of the reason for visiting. From fine dining beside the ocean to eating traditional dishes in rustic, inexpensive cafes, the dining choices in Fiji are out of this world. MAMANUCA ISLANDS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalamala Beach Club For a dining experience completely different to everything else in Fiji\n\nYou\u2019d come for the novelty factor alone: Malamala Beach Club is the world\u2019s first beach club on its very own island and it\u2019s only half an hour by ferry from Port Denarau. Buy a day pass and hit the spa, and the island\u2019s pools and stunning beaches. Its food offerings have been overshadowed; but this is a heck of a venue for a meal. There\u2019s a choice between restaurants - dine pool-side or opt for the adult\u2019s only area. The chicken curry is one of the best you\u2019ll find in a country famous for them; though the loaded fries (with bacon and beef brisket) are legendary too.\n\nMalamala Island, Mamanuca Islands. Phone +679 999 5512. See malamalabeachclub.com/eat-drink Cloud 9\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWood-fired pizza and drinks in the middle of the ocean\n\nCloud 9 is one of Fiji\u2019s most iconic dining and drinking options. It\u2019s a floating two-level platform in the middle of the lagoons around the Mamanuca Islands, close to Fiji\u2019s most legendary surf break, Cloudbreak. Take a boat transfer (or arrive by jet-ski or seaplane) from Port Denarau and enjoy a lunch of hand-made Italian pizza cooked in a wood-fired on-site oven. Eat on the sundeck or grab a day bed, and listen to DJs as you order cocktails from the bar and swim straight off the platform in some of the most pristine waters of Fiji.\n\nMamanuca Islands. Phone: +679 869 7947. See cloud9.com.fj VITI LEVU Broady\u2019s Bar & Cafe Well-priced no-frills meals served for locals\n\nIt\u2019s simple, inexpensive and it quickly became one of Fiji\u2019s hottest eating venues \u2013 there\u2019s live music here at nights and some of the best cocktails you\u2019ll find in Melanesia. But owner Michael Broadridge wanted to make his bar/caf\u00e9 a one-stop shop for everything from a hearty breakfast with Fiji\u2019s best coffee, to dinners and nighttime entertainment. Situated just off the Queen\u2019s Road in the Nadi suburb, Martintar, eating here is a great way to mix with Fijian locals away from the resorts. Don\u2019t go past the grilled catch of the day with creamy ota (a local fern that is a Fijian delicacy).\n\nCnr Queens Road and Zahoor St, Nadi, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 672 2193. See facebook.com/BroadysBC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiko\u2019s Floating Restaurant & Bar Where else should you eat seafood but on a boat?\n\nThis place has built itself a solid reputation among locals and more experimental tourists alike. Located on Suva Harbour, the nation\u2019s capital is often overlooked. But getting here for a famous Tiko\u2019s seafood feast as the sun sets over the harbour will make your holiday extra-special. Located on a two-storey boat whose lower deck is a bar and upper deck is a restaurant, the atmosphere is always charged. Try its iconic curried mud crab (qari) in coconut cream; not before a Margarita below.\n\nStinson Parade Road, Suva Harbour, Viti Levu. Phone +679 450 2959.

Built on a tiny islet off the mainland, guests walk along a causeway lit up with flaming tiki torches to a restaurant on its own island. You can choose to dine by candlelight on the beach, or within an open-sided traditional Fijian-style pavilion. Seafood is the specialty here \u2013 the restaurant is Trip Advisor\u2019s Top-Rated seafood restaurant in Fiji. Order a seafood platter for two \u2013 though children are welcome if you prefer to share the intimate experience.\n\nQueens Road, Warwick, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 653 0555. See warwickhotels.com Kanavata (Nunuku Resort) Personalised meals for couples in the treetops\n\nThere's a thousand romantic dining options across Fiji in its five-star resorts and hotels. But there's one option that really stands out \u2013 simply for its location. Travel to Pacific Harbour on Viti Levu's south coast and enjoy a romantic meal for two on a viewing platform built right up amongst the canopy of a local dilo tree overlooking a beach. A dedicated chef will cook for your tastes, with seafood caught in Beqa lagoon a specialty (with everything from lobster, octopus to snapper available). Consider a spa treatment on the platform after your meal. You don't have to be a guest.\n\n11 Nanuku Drive, Pacific Harbour, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 345 2100. See nanukuresort.com Baka Blues Cafe\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCelebrating USA\u2019s Southern barbecue\u2026 in Melanesia\n\nThere\u2019s always been something quirky about Pacific Harbour, the lesser-known tourist hub past the Coral Coast on Fiji\u2019s main island, Viti Levu. Home to a collection of bars, restaurants and cafes that break the mould of what you\u2019d expect to find in Fiji \u2013 Baka Blues Cafe is a New Orleans inspired blues bar which celebrates the American Deep South. You\u2019ll find local musicians, photos from the South and a menu celebrating Southern barbecue, Creole and Cajun food (don\u2019t go without trying the sizzling baby back ribs or Texas T-bone). It\u2019s a sports bar too \u2013 though families are encouraged to sit where kids can play the giant Jenga blocks.\n\n1342 Hibiscus Drive, Port Harbour, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 992 7453. See restaurantsnapshot.com/BakaBluesCafe Ocean Terrace (Bedarra Beach Inn) Wholesome Fijian fare served in a cosy setting\n\nCentrally located on the Coral Coast, you won\u2019t find better curries anywhere in Fiji (all are served with various home-made chutneys). And yet Ocean Terrace Restaurant is most famous for its local lobster \u2013 cooked in a bisque and laced with brandy. Sit outside on the veranda overlooking the pool to the lagoon beyond for either breakfast, lunch or dinner. Dinner includes candlelight and live music. Don\u2019t go past their coconut pancake rolls with local fish, though their kokoda (raw local fish marinated with coconut milk and lime) shouldn\u2019t be missed.\n\nSunset Strip, Korotogo, Sigatoka, Viti Levu.

See bedarrafiji.com Bulaccino\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA casual farm-to-table cafe and restaurant\n\nThis was the caf\u00e9 that kicked off Fiji\u2019s caf\u00e9 culture when it opened in 2006, making the country a genuinely legitimate destination for coffee aficionados. Though coffee\u2019s just part of what you\u2019ll get. Run by a local family, most ingredients come straight off the owners\u2019 12 hectare organic farm just outside Nadi (you can take a farm tour), making this a bona fide farm-to-table eatery. The setting\u2019s casual but chic \u2013 art deco with an open-air bar set in a garden outside. Locals love it, so it\u2019s a great way to immerse yourself into the Nadi community away from the resorts of Denarau Island. There\u2019s also an outpost in Suva.\n\nQueens Road, Namaka, Nadi, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 672 8638. See bulaccino.com Geckos Resort Restaurant Great seafood and curries served with a weekend dance show\n\nGeckos Resort Restaurant is a Coral Coast dining institution \u2013 home to one of the most lively Polynesian dance and fire shows in Fiji. Located within a low-key 28-room resort set in an historic village, it\u2019s only 500 metres from the Shangri La Resort, and a few minutes from Sigatoka Town. Visit on a Friday and Saturday night for an hour-long dance and fire show. Turn up early for happy hour from 5-7pm, and order local mud crab and lobster delivered fresh that morning, or curry cooked by a local Indo-Fijian chef.\n\nQueens Highway, Sigatoka, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 652 0200. See facebook.com/GeckosResort Waitui Bar & Grill (Sofitel Fiji Resort & Spa)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeafood and meat chargrilled at a beachside setting\n\nDenarau Island has multiple dining options. One of the best options amongst an array of offerings at five-star resorts is Sofitel Resort & Spa\u2019s exclusive adults-only restaurant, Waitui Bar & Grill. There\u2019s a colonial feel to the open-air, multi-level restaurant beside the beach, with its weatherboard slats and big timber bar (the perfect spot for sunset drinks). Meat and seafood is cooked on a house-built charcoal grill \u2013 most ingredients are sourced locally. The lobster\u2019s a house specialty, and the cocktail list is overwhelming. Dishes are designed with sharing in mind.\n\nDenarau Island, off Viti Levu. Phone: +679 675 1111. See sofitel-fiji.com Indigo Indian Asian Restaurant The best Indian food on Viti Levu\n\nWith nearly 40 per cent of Fiji\u2019s population having Indian heritage \u2013 Indo-Fijian flavours are almost as big a part of the diet as indigenous flavours. And some of the best Indo-Fijian flavours are available at centrally located Indigo Indian Asian Resort on the waterfront at Port Denarau. Try the local masala crab or the musallam of lamb with chillies and spices grown at the restaurant\u2019s own organic farm. There are two separate menus \u2013 Indian and South-East Asian \u2013 so it\u2019s like having two restaurants in one. Get there early for a sunset over the ocean.\n\nPort Denarau, Denarau Island, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 675 0026. See www.indigofiji.com VANUA LEVU\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNamale Resort & Spa Romantic fine dining on another level\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to stay to eat here \u2013 and kids aren\u2019t welcome \u2013 but Namale Resort & Spa offer foodies the ultimate Fijian dining experience. There are two restaurants on-site, but you can dine out where you like \u2013 from a candlelit cave, to a table on the beach, or a table set beside a private waterfall. All produce comes from the resort\u2019s own organic farm and a local market. Located on Fiji\u2019s second-largest island, Vanua Levu, the resort is built along its stunning northern coastline, called Hibiscus Highway. There\u2019s a weekly Indian and lovo (underground oven) night.\n\n1 Hibiscus Highway, Savusavu, Vanua Levu. Phone: +679 885 0435.

    "text": "Trainer Paul Preusker has Geelong Cup-winner Torranzino ready for the Melbourne Cup. Credit: Jason South On Tuesday, just five years after her first race ride in a maiden at Moe in June 2020, she will ride in her first Melbourne Cup aboard the Paul Preusker-trained Torranzino. When the gates open, Gaudray will become just the 11th woman to ride in the Cup\u2019s history. \u201cShe\u2019s gifted in a lot of ways on horseback. She has a good understanding of horse movement, is incredible at riding horses over jumps and jumping big fences on horses bareback,\u201d Carey said. \u201cFor a girl her age she was pretty fearless and ready to advance her riding at an early age. She was a bit daring.\u201d Gaudray has a winning laugh too.\n\nIt lands as regularly as her mounts on raceday (30 per cent of her rides have finished in the placings) and emerges as soon as she recalls the education she had working with Carey and his wife Cheryl as she learnt the skills needed to become a jockey. Carey paired her up with a former racehorse I Maximus, a stable favourite who was smart enough to be reliable but in the trainer\u2019s words, \u201cnot bombproof\u201d. It meant whoever was riding him needed to be on their game when on his back. Gaudray as an apprentice in 2021. Credit: Getty Images \u201cHe was a strong, older horse, but he still knew what a racetrack was and he did bolt off on me a few times and made me a stronger rider,\u201d Gaudray said. Underneath the smile is a tough sportswoman, a person who had a long apprenticeship due to a number of injuries at both track work and in races, finally out-riding her claim this time last year.\n\nIn just her fourth race ride she suffered a fracture in her back and injured her knee when she tumbled off Midas Man on the dirt at Pakenham. Loading Three months later she got right back on the horse, literally, when she rode her first winner on the Carey-trained Tippitywichit at Traralgon. \u201cI had a rough start to my apprenticeship. I had quite a few injuries at track work. Pat had a few scary horses and I would hold on for dear life,\u201d Gaudray said. \u201cDuring that [fourth] race I fractured my back and my knee but before that I did my foot, my knee, my wrist, my coccyx, the list goes on.\u201d\n\nThe run of injuries had nothing to do with her riding ability. Nor did they deter Gaudray, who revelled in the environment and never felt an attack of nerves. \u201cI am super, super competitive. I love winning, I just love going out there and giving my horse every chance to win the race,\u201d Gaudray said. Carey has taught multiple apprentices. He knew Gaudray had what it would take to make it in the often brutal, relentless world of being a jockey.\n\n\u201cFrom the time she started to ride she had polish, she was a good rider. She had to learn about racing. She did not have the racing smarts, but she was a natural for the competition, and she had great style, and she knew horses well,\u201d Carey said. \u201c[She is a] natural lightweight, incredible balance and acrobatic ability, [on the] trampoline, [doing] somersaults and tumbles and very good core strength.\u201d Gaudray at home. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui That strength was on display one day at apprentice school under former jockeys Alf Matthews and Darren Gauci\u2019s tutelage, when she was challenged to an arm wrestle alongside eight of her peers \u2013 a bunch of male and female apprentices. \u201cI wrestled one and beat one and they all wanted to have a go and I beat them all,\u201d Gaudray said.\n\nThe giggle returns as she tells the story. It feels like the laugh is never far away. Loading Her positive outlook has helped her work through the inevitable bumps along the way, her name finding headlines for the wrong reasons before she had really started. She was suspended for three months in 2021 after being part of the now infamous jockeys\u2019 party at a Mornington Airbnb during Victoria\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown, an incident Carey suspects helped Gaudray recognise where the limits were to what she could and couldn\u2019t do in a highly regulated industry. Gaudray doesn\u2019t shy away from the incident but says it\u2019s more the business itself than the incident that has influenced her approach to life.\n\n\u201cIn general this industry ensures you mature quickly just because you are with professional people and there is a lot of money involved and you have to be in top form to get around it all,\u201d Gaudray said. \u201cI would not say that particular event matured me but just racing in general.\u201d Rider Emily Brown takes Torranzino for a run on a bush track. Credit: Jason South Cup-winning rider Michelle Payne is a fan. She was rapt to see Gaudray land a ride in the Cup. \u201cShe is a very good rider. She\u2019s very likeable as a person and a rider so that helps obviously to gain opportunities and then you just need a bit of luck on your side. I was the same age when I had my first ride for Bart Cummings [in 2009 on Allez Wonder] and all those feelings came back,\u201d Payne said.\n\nThose who know Gaudray well say she is quiet and happiest with her showjumping horses such as Felix and her fiance Ethan Brown, who will ride Ciaron Maher\u2019s Middle Earth in the Cup. That laugh returns when asked whether that is true as Gaudray admits she is not sure Brown is happiest around her horses. \u201cEthan doesn\u2019t really like it, but he will come wherever I drag him to,\u201d Gaudray said. Such cheekiness has probably helped her to connect with Torranzino, a lightweight Cup chance that can be difficult to ride. Gaudray says Preusker, who trained Surprise Baby into fifth place in the 2019 Cup and 13th in 2020, has done a remarkable job to unlock the six-year-old gelding\u2019s talent.\n\n\u201cHe was not an easy horse early doors \u2026 this time in, he has got rid of all those bad habits and I feel like I have formed a really good relationship with the horse and I feel like we get on really well,\u201d Gaudray said. Carey says many people at Racing Victoria, the apprentice school and her peers have helped Gaudray realise her talent. He is an admirer and proud that the apprentices who pass through his stable can still walk in the back door of his house and make themselves at home. Gaudray remains grateful and connected to those who have helped along the way. \u201cPat was the ultimate best master I could have had. I always pop in and have a cup of coffee with him,\u201d she said. Carey remains in her corner, his family a solid base for the young people as they mature. But as Tuesday beckons he knows Gaudray will handle the moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to pat them on the back when they are winning but the most important thing is to be there to support them when it all falls apart,\u201d Carey said. Loading \u201cIt is a mentally tortuous business where you are getting heat from a lot of different areas. One thing about Celine is she is mentally tough and able to cope. She is not phased by the enormity of the task.\u201d Payne remains the only woman to have ridden a Melbourne Cup winner but Gaudray, Jamie Melham and Rachel King are as good a chance as any heading to the barriers on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d Gaudray said.",

Credit: Getty Images The Biden administration maintained them and significantly tightened the restrictions on semiconductor exports in a \u201csmall yard, high fence\u201d policy stance that was far more heavily tilted towards national security than the trade balance. In Trump\u2019s second term, threats of even tighter technology restrictions appear less driven by national security concerns than by Trump\u2019s fixation with US trade deficits, his suspicion that those deficits reveal something sinister (rather than a US savings rate that is lower than it needs to be to finance American living standards) and his desire to use his beloved tariffs as leverage to do commercial deals. He does love a deal.\n\nHe got one last week, one that injects a pause of at least 12 months into the US-China trade conflict. The US got a promise of some soybean purchases by China, Xi\u2019s pledge to try to throttle the supply of precursor chemicals used in fentanyl production and an agreement that China wouldn\u2019t implement its tighter controls of rare earth and magnet exports while the truce is in place. Loading China won a winding back of the extension of America\u2019s \u201cblack list\u201d of Chinese companies to cover subsidiaries, which would have expanded the number of companies prohibited from acquiring advanced US technologies from about 1300 to more than 20,000. It was only the announcement of the vastly increased list \u2013 in breach, China thought, of a standstill agreement reached earlier this year \u2013 that caused it to toughen its restrictions on rare earths and magnets.\n\nThe US has agreed to halve the 20 per cent tariff on China\u2019s exports related to its role in fentanyl production and also to halt the imposition of steep port fees on Chinese ships docking at US ports. (China has similarly removed its retaliatory duties on US-financed ships using its ports.) What the deal struck last week highlights is the imbalance in power within the trade relationship. Trump thought access to America\u2019s vast consumer marketplace gave him unmatchable leverage \u2013until Xi responded by threatening to use its near-monopoly on the rare earths and rare earth magnets to almost instantly cripple US manufacturing and its defence capabilities. By slashing China\u2019s purchases of soybeans from farmers in Trump\u2019s midwestern political strongholds to zero in the current harvest season, Xi also showed he understands how to exploit the vulnerability of politicians in a democracy. Those soybean farmers were becoming increasingly desperate and angry.\n\nIt will take the US and its allies up to a decade to build the mines and processing infrastructure that would shield them from China\u2019s stranglehold over critical minerals. Meanwhile, Xi has a far more potent weapon in his trade arsenal than anything Trump can call on; one he can roll out anytime the US tries to flex its muscles. It\u2019s not the only one. China has an equally dominant position in, for instance, some key pharmaceutical products and ingredients and has the best part of a decade, and the advantages provided by a state-directed economy that is less concerned about productive uses of national capital than in its geopolitical ambitions, to develop other areas of dominance. What began as an attack on China\u2019s exports to the US, along with an effort to stifle its technological advancements, also developed into a trade war on everyone else. China might have agreed to buy 12 million tonnes of soybeans from the US this season (though it has already secured supplies into the first part of next year) and 25 million tonnes a year for three years, but it bought about 22.5 million tonnes in the same harvest period last year. Before Trump\u2019s 2018-19 trade war, China used to buy more than 40 per cent of the US crop. If it makes good on last week\u2019s commitments, it will buy less than 25 per cent.\n\nChina has demonstrated that it can acquire all the beans it needs from Brazil, where it helped develop soybean production and the infrastructure to export it after the 2018-19 trade war, and more recently Argentina. Where its soybeans once represented trade leverage for the US, the roles have now been reversed. After Trump\u2019s truly great deal with China, China still has an effective average tariff rate of about 47 per cent, though most of that relates to tariffs imposed during Trump\u2019s 2018-19 trade war. Loading Leaving those aside, it still has a 10 per cent fentanyl-related tariff, a 10 per cent \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff and exposures to Trump\u2019s global sectoral tariffs which, relative to where it stood when Trump regained office, actually leaves it better positioned against other trading nations, who generally face US tariffs of 15 to 20 per cent (though some are 50 per cent) than it was back in February. This week, the US Supreme Court will start hearing a case brought against Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, which could force the unwinding of his reciprocal tariffs and potentially the return of billions of dollars of duties already collected.",

As the CEO, I am accountable for Optus' failings. And I am deeply sorry. We are all deeply sorry. The tragic events. The tragic deaths of people will stay with us an individual\u2019s - and as a company, as we investigate the incident.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he has written to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to resolve the issue of who will host next year's COP31 summit.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says Australia is continuing to engage with T\u00fcrkiye's President to find a solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia and T\u00fcrkiye have both submitted bids in 2022 to host the United Nations climate conference - and both countries have refused to concede to the other ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hosting rights are granted by consensus, not a vote - which means if the deadlock remains, the hosting rights for the event would default to the German city of Bonn.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal frontbencher Andrew Bragg says he thinks the Coalition will be able to reach an agreement to retain some form of net zero policy, despite the Nationals position.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the weekend, the Nationals voted in party room meeting to abandon net zero as a policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the two parties cannot reach an agreement on climate policy, some Liberals say MPs should be prepared to end the Coalition arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Bragg says net zero can be a part of the Coalition form, but it would need some revisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You have to have net zero in some form. There is no doubt that Australia has very serious treaty obligations. Now the question of how you get to net zero is something for each country to make up their own mind on. My point is we're a serious country. We're a trade exposed nation. We're not going to walk away from international agreements. Never. We have to work harder to maintain Australia's international obligations. But do it in a way that suits the Australian economy and the Australian society.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nSix months after being elected, the Prime Minister says his government is strengthening Medicare by lifting the number of people who can receive free GP treatments.\n\n\n\nNew changes have come into effect from November 1, making it easier to see a GP for free.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe financial incentives for GPs to bulk-bill has now expanded beyond concession card holders - or children aged 16 years and under - to include any patient eligible for Medicare.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese says the changes will benefit many.\n\n\n\n\"When you get sick you will get the care that you need. Not on the size of your wallet or your bank balance, you will get it on the basis of need. That is a fundamentally proud element of who we are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health consultations conducted via telehealth are now no longer exempt from the established clinical relationship requirement.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote and rural First Nations communities across Australia experience an average 49 disconnections from their energy retailer each year - or nearly one power cut a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese communities have only one option for energy - and that is prepaid or upfront payments, to connect to small local suppliers that service their area.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to research by the Aboriginal community and clean energy organisation, Original Power, 65-thousand First Nations Australians are impacted by this in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nReport co-author, Lloyd Pigram, is a researcher at the University of Notre Dame's Nulungu Research Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS, the findings are eye-opening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenges of being on prepaid meters that I was first introduced when visiting family that I didn't take notice until I went and did the survey. Things that came out of the survey (include) food spoilages, old people (experiencing) chronic illnesses, running out of power as we doing it.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cricket, India has won its first-ever Women's World Cup title.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team has held off South Africa by 52 runs in the final, in front of a sell-out home crowd at Mumbai\u2019s DY Patil Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the side's third attempt at the title, after finishing as runners-up in 2005 and 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Harmanpreet Kaur says the win means so much.\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Hanson-Young said the 17-hour delay in communicating the severity of the outage was \"not good enough\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You were too busy putting your ducks in order, telling your board what was going on, contacting your executives, making sure your company's ducks were in order,\" she fired up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Meanwhile, the federal government, the regulator, and the minister were left in the dark.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Australian senator said the company had prioritised \"profits\" over \"people's safety\", a characterisation that Rue rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was important to have the facts, so I had the information I could accurately provide to the ACMA and the federal government,\" he said.\n\n\n\nOptus CEO assures 'controls in place' to prevent failure\n\nAt the start of the inquiry, Rue said the September failure was \"unacceptable\" and personally apologised for the tragic event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm accountable for Optus' failings, and I'm deeply sorry.

People effectively didn't do their jobs,\" Rue told the committee.\n\n\n\nOffshore call centres received the complaint calls that notified Optus of the triple-zero outage. As a result of the September process failures, Rue revealed that complaint calls for triple zero, elderly and other vulnerable customers would now be handled by onshore call centres.\n\n\n\n\n\nRue defended his position at Optus, stating that a change in leadership would \"actually set back that plan, which would not be good for customers and the telecommunications sector\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOptus chairman John Arthur said Rue had been brought on the manage these sort of outages and ensure they didn't happen again. He backed him to stay on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were, I think 10 failures here, 10 failures.

All those in favour say aye. AYE.... ((applause))\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vote they took was to drop their support for Australia's net zero emissions by 2050 policy - which Nationals leader David Littleproud has maintained makes little sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Domestically we've lost over seven million hectares of agricultural land and we'll lose another five million hectares of agricultural land on this trajectory that Labor is taking us... We need to understand that if there's a better way then we should explore it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA day later, at the full party room meeting, the Nationals made it official for their parliamentarians in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm proud to say that our party room has got to a unanimous position of scrapping net zero commitments by 2050.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nationals leader says that instead, the country's greenhouse gas emissions should be tied to an average of similar countries within the OECD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is about bringing common sense back to climate and energy policy. This is about saying we're going to live up to our commitments internationally. We're going to do that sensibly - but we're going to do what they're doing - at their pace, not streak ahead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nationals' decision has already attracted intense criticism from Labor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is chasing an interim target of 62 to 70 per cent emissions cuts by 2035, and wants to achieve a target of 82 percent of electricity sourced from renewables by 2030 as part of that commitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change Minister Chris Bowen has consequently called the Nationals' criticism of that approach monumentally shortsighted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Nationals party is betraying future generations, but they're also betraying farmers and people in regional communities who can benefit from this massive transformation. They seem to be stuck in the past and despite any encouragement we can give them in the Parliament, they seem to determined to stay there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister has also criticised the move.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Nationals argue Australia's climate targets are driving up power prices and shutting down industry, Anthony Albanese has suggested any delay in reaching net zero would impose additional costs on the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regional party also argues Australia is doing more than its fair share to reduce carbon pollution - but the PM says Australia could always do more.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Australia also has a responsibility to act on climate change because the country - and its neighbours - are especially vulnerable to the impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We act nationally. We've submitted our NDC (nationally determined contribution) to the UN for 2035. It's an ambitious but achievable target. And it's in the interests of Australia for that to occur, just as it's in our interests to encourage global action.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens Sarah Hanson-Young has also weighed in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Australian people simply won't be copping such a ridiculous policy from a party that thinks they should be in government... And our Pacific neighbours are going to be furious that they hear that this type of ridiculous snake oil of a policy is being promoted by the National party - and indeed, the Coalition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention is now turning to whether the Liberals will follow suit when they meet on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nNet-zero policy has become a fractious issue within the federal coalition following its disastrous May election defeat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's speculation that the regional party's decision to walk away from formal emissions targets will anger some moderate Liberals who want to remain committed to net zero by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Littleproud says there are similarities in terms of policy and intent between the positions of the Liberals and the Nationals, based on his conversations with energy spokesman Dan Tehan and the opposition leader Sussan Ley [[lee]].\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Coalition spokeswoman Angie Bell - who is a Liberal MP - has told Sky News that they intend to make up their own minds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not beholden to the National party. We are the Liberal party. I sit in the Liberal party room in Canberra, and we will go through our processes - which your viewers would understand would be different to the National party processes. And we will come to that in due course when we've done the work and we understand where our policy needs to be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nationals' net zero decision could also have implications for the government's environment bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor needs to secure a deal with either the Greens or the Coalition to pass these environment reforms in the Senate - and Sarah Hanson Young says the government should not be discussing the bill with the Coalition now.\n\n\n\n",

Source: SBS News / Supplied Now, Raad and her husband only pay for two subscriptions. Every month, they \"double check\" what they are paying and if they come to the conclusion that they are paying \"too much\" for a streaming service, they will cancel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We really budget very carefully. I feel like if that wasn't the case, which I assume for a lot of people that's not necessarily the case, then yes, it [the cost] definitely gets too much and it adds up,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe subscription surge\n\nWhile Raad has managed to keep her subscription bills at a \"manageable\" rate, for many Australians, this is not the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a new report, average monthly spending on subscriptions has increased to a record number, rising by 24 per cent from $63 to $78 in 2025, with each household having an average of 3.7 subscriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeloitte\u2019s annual Media & Entertainment Consumer Insights report shows that the number of subscriptions per household has risen by 12 per cent since last year and by 61 per cent since 2021.\n\n\n\nAccording to the survey of 2,000 Australian media consumers across five generations, 36 per cent of respondents reported that the money they spend on their subscription is over budget, and 78 per cent expressed concerns about the total cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nEighty-three per cent of respondents paid for video streaming platforms, more than half had a music streaming subscription, and one in four paid for sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We live in a world now where we don't own anything, but we subscribe to everything,\" Chandni Gupta, deputy CEO and digital policy director at Consumer Policy Research Centre (CPRC), told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not surprising that those numbers are quite high and that we are paying a lot more than we probably were five or ten years ago.\"\n\n\n\nThe 'Hotel California effect'\n\nThe report said that the rise in spending is caused by a mix of shifts in market conditions and consumer behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past years, prices for platforms like Netflix and Spotify have increased multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It should be really clear what you are paying for and if prices have gone up, why have they gone up,\" Gupta said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because there's very little interoperability. It's really hard to suddenly move from one platform to another ... you are often locked in by the service.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How much does it really cost to raise a child in Australia? Here are the numbers\n\nBut for those Australians like Raad who are trying to cancel their subscription, the process is not as easy as expected, as they find themselves in the \"subscription trap\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscription trap is a business tactic where a consumer is enticed into a recurring subscription by making it difficult to cancel.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2024 CPRC report reveals that nearly half of Australians spend more time than planned trying to cancel their subscriptions, and one in ten give up while attempting to cancel a subscription.\n\n\n\n\"It's a really unfair system that's been designed very much for profit over people, and it does mean that you are holding onto subscriptions a lot longer than you probably need or want,\" Gupta said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's also known as the Hotel California effect, which is based on the Eagles song. So you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is very much how these websites have been designed.\"\n\n\n\nAustralians 'learning to touch grass'\n\nOn the other hand, increased media and entertainment consumption is not among the reasons Australians are paying more for subscriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeloitte\u2019s report indicates that Australians spent two and a half hours less on media and entertainment compared to 2024, amounting to 42 hours and 45 minutes weekly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in 2025, Australians spent almost an hour less on streaming video services, according to the report.\n\n\n\nPeter Corbett, Deloitte Australia's telecommunications, media and technology lead partner, said: \"Time spent engaging with media and entertainment has fallen for a second year in a row, as Australians become increasingly choosy about what they consume.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians are learning to touch grass or disconnect from technology.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the reasons for this \"isn\u2019t quite clear\", but \"It could be a mix of factors, including \u2014 after a peak in screen time during COVID, consumers are choosing more 'in person' entertainment forms, or changing preferences for the content mix offered across media categories\".\n\n\n\nLess time scrolling, more desire for creating\n\nThe decline was not limited to the media and entertainment sectors. The report shows Australians now spend an average of five hours and 20 minutes on social media weekly, which is a 16 per cent decrease from the 6 hours and 20 minutes they spent scrolling in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoomers recorded the highest drop (27 per cent) in social media use, while Gen Z and Millennials also scrolled 14 per cent less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decline in average social media use has eclipsed the broader media and entertainment consumption decline,\" Corbett said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although the extent of this decline is inconsistent across demographics, as different age groups use social media in different ways for different purposes.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough social media is declining in popularity in Australia, the report shows that content creation has become more accessible and more popular than ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the data, one in five Australians has considered becoming a content creator, with money, creative self-expression, and connection/community being their top three reasons for their desire.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers are even higher for Gen Z, with 39 per cent of the generation showing a desire to be a content creator.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The year 2050 is planned to mark a turning point for Australia \u2014 when wind farms replace coal mines, and the country entirely erases its carbon footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Nationals on Sunday announced that it will ditch the plan, after reaching a unanimous agreement in the party room meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means the party will formally abandon its previous commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, a long-standing goal of Australian governments across the political spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the meeting, Nationals Leader David Littleproud told the reporters: \"When you're only a bit over one per cent of total global emissions, you can hardly mitigate the world's emissions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe net-zero target has also been a point of debate in the Liberal Party, following their defeat in the May Federal elections.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Nationals abandon net zero after members vote to dump climate target\n\nOpposition energy spokesperson Dan Tehan has stated that the Liberals will likely decide on their position six to nine months after the federal election, between November and January.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is what the net zero target exactly means, and why it has been at the centre of Australia's political debates in recent months.\n\n\n\nWhat is net zero?\n\nThe term \"net zero\" is a relatively recent scientific concept that was introduced in various research in the 2000s: humans not adding further greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and slowing down climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate professor Ruth Morgan, director of the Centre for Environmental History at the Australian National University, told SBS News: \"The idea behind net zero is that ideally countries will be able to work towards ensuring that the amount of greenhouse gases that they emit will be offset or be countered by the amount of greenhouse gases that can be absorbed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So that we reach an equilibrium where we are not adding further greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea soon found its way into politics and climate diplomacy as a solution to global warming, and it was a crucial part of the 2015 Paris Agreement , a legally binding international treaty on climate change.\n\n\n\nThe agreement's aim was to limit global warming below 2 degrees, and ideally 1.5 degrees by 2050 \u2014 a goal that net zero was an important part of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea was that through cooperation, countries would ensure that they were not going to keep their economies going as business as usual,\" Morgan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, reaching net zero is critical to doing that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every country has nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement that they're trying to achieve ... and that's all part of trying to reach net zero, so that we are not adding more and more greenhouse gases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action, as of October 2025, 145 countries have announced or are considering net zero targets.\n\n\n\nWhat does net zero mean for Australia?\n\nThe Australian government has committed to achieving net zero by 2050 and is pursuing an interim target of 62 to 70 per cent emissions cuts by 2035 compared to 2005 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nAchieving 82 per cent of electricity from renewables by 2030 is essential for reaching Australia's climate targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut reaching these numbers can be challenging.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE No Australians immune: What 2050 and beyond will look like for your city\n\nFatemeh Salehi, the hub chair for the United Nations academic impact group from Macquarie University, said: \"Our economy has been tied to fossil fuels for decades. Coal and gas still make up around 65 per cent of electricity generation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The targets are ambitious but achievable, provided policy, infrastructure, and workforce development move in step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Meeting these goals requires a holistic approach that combines diverse renewable and low-emission solutions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan added that the other solution that will help reach the target is \"trying to reduce the amount of land clearing\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's another way in which we've traditionally added to greenhouse gases. So by trying to curb deforestation and limit the amount of vegetation that's cleared, we can also try to reduce impacts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the Nationals ditch the plan?\n\nSince the Coalition's historic loss in the federal elections, different factions of the opposition have criticised the net zero plan. But the Nationals' announcement on Sunday was the first official move against the target.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is expected that the decision will likely anger some moderate Liberals who want to remain committed to achieving net zero by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals Leader David Littleproud, however, has argued that walking away from net zero doesn't mean they are denying the existence of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're saying is there's a better, cheaper, fairer way to address it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regional party claims that Australia is contributing more than its fair share to reduce carbon pollution, and suggests that emissions targets should be based on the average of comparable OECD countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittleproud has also said the move will be welcomed by all voters because it will lead to lower energy bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, according to Morgan, abandoning the net-zero target will not benefit communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really unfortunate because I think the Nationals are supposed to be the party of people that live in regional Australia, and yet we are seeing so often that they are representing the big mining bodies and they are not one and the same thing,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think it's an either-or situation. We're seeing a lot of opportunities and money going into regional communities that want renewable energy to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing stonewalling, which is ultimately going to do their [the Nationals'] constituents a great disservice.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent them from developing life-threatening allergies, a new US study has shown it's making a big difference in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study found about 60,000 children in the United States have avoided developing peanut allergies after new guidance was issued in 2015 about when to introduce the allergen to youngsters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the new guidelines, parents were warned to avoid exposing their children to potentially risky foods until they were three years old, in the hope of avoiding a full-blown allergy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeanut allergy is one of the most common of these conditions, caused when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger symptoms like hives, respiratory issues, and sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut groundbreaking research, known as Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, published by professor Gideon Lack of King's College London, suggested earlier exposure might actually help children.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Peanut butter loving babies are licking allergies, study suggests SBS News 06:05 English\n\n\"The LEAP study ... showed that if we actually introduce that allergen to children by mouth, having them eat it, before they're introduced to it via their skin, we can reduce the risk that that child's going to go on to develop the food allergy itself,\" Dr David Hill, from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHill has published a new study after analysing electronic health records from dozens of paediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the new guidelines were issued.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's found thousands of other children in the US have also avoided developing peanut allergies after their parents followed the dietary advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What our data shows is that because of, or at least associated with those early introduction guidelines, there's about 60,000 less kids with food allergy today than there would have been. And that's a remarkable thing, right? That's the size of some cities,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAustralian research shows 'modest reduction'\n\nAssociate Professor Rachel Peters has been part of food allergy research at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's National Allergy Centre of Excellence.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said at least two major studies have been completed in Australia in the last decade to explore what might prevent such allergies in the first place \u2014 one before Australia adopted new infant feeding guidelines in 2016, and one after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had two population-based studies recruited in the same region, which was Melbourne, Australia,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"So we had two cohorts recruited with exactly the same methods, but 10 years apart.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the research measured what parents were doing in early feeding practices, which showed that nearly 90 per cent of babies were being fed peanut-containing products in the first year of life, as recommended by the guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research showed a \"modest reduction\" in food allergy but not as much as researchers expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even though we are certainly starting to see a reduction in the rates of peanut allergy in Australia, they are still quite high, and higher than in some other countries around the world, and higher than what was shown in this American study as well,\" she said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Australia - allergy capital of the world SBS News 06:23 English\n\nPeters says the Australian findings suggest much more study needs to be done to establish the various causes of food allergies.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said some research \u2014 including exploration of whether less sunlight and vitamin D exposure increases the likelihood of developing allergies \u2014 has offered promising evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We even see that within Australia. We have higher rates of food allergy in Melbourne compared to what we see in Queensland,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the charity group Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia, peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies in childhood in Australia, affecting three per cent of infants up to the age of 12 months.\n\n\n\n",

Melbourne law firm Phi Finney McDonald is acting on behalf of affected patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complaint alleges the company failed to take reasonable steps to protect information from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access.\n\n\n\nIt also alleges Genea failed to destroy or remove information once it was no longer needed, and that it breached its obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 by not informing affected individuals sooner.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenea - one of Australia's largest IVF clinics \u2014 has 19 clinics across Australia, and one clinic in Thailand. It specialises in IVF, genetic testing, egg and sperm freezing, and fertility testing.\n\n\n\nCyber incidents are up 11 per cent from last year with large organisations being the main target, according to the Australian Signals Directorate.

But from Saturday, we think another 70,000 Australians with kidney disease will become eligible for this life-changing drug,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 Census, around 1 per cent of the Australian population is living with kidney disease, with one in twenty Australians aged 75 and above being diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\n\n'It's gonna make a big difference'\n\nPeter Brown, who was diagnosed with kidney disease two years ago and has been relying on medication to improve his condition, said he was pleased to learn his upcoming medication bill can be cheaper\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's gonna make a big difference, and the fact that $7.70 is a big difference when you work it out over 12 months,\" said Brown, referring to the concession-card rate for a single script of Jardiance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor eligible patients without a concession card, a script now costs $31.60. From next year, the price will be further lowered to $25.\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler says Jardiance, also known as Empagliflozin, is life-changing for many Australians. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Butler said kidney disease was a silent epidemic in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think more than two and a half million Australians have kidney disease, but less than 10 per cent of them know about it, because the signs and symptoms of kidney disease usually only become apparent when it's as much as 90 per cent of loss of kidney function has already taken place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Carol Pollock, the chair of Kidney Health Australia, also stresses the importance of conducting health checks to detect the asymptomatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To pick up kidney disease, what we really need is a blood test, a blood pressure check and a urine test. And some people will have some of these tests done, but not always together, and we really need the three of them to be done,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And what we would like to see is a kidney health check that meant that people would have those things done and then have an understanding of what the risk the kidney disease could be and allow it to be appropriately treated.\"\n\n\n\n",

Often our calls weren't even answered.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of the inquest, coroner Joanne Kearsley had said there was little doubt that the tragic death of Awaab Ishak should be a defining moment for the housing sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the UK government has enacted a new law that makes landlords responsible for investigating any potential emergency hazard within 24 hours of being made aware of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive of the National Housing Federation, Kate Henderson, has said in a statement that her organisation fully supports it - and has already been making an effort to improve things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since 2020 housing associations have increased spending on repairs and maintenance by 55%, with plans to spend a further \u00a350bn over the next five years. This is why 90% of our homes meet the decent homes standard, more than all other tenures.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law is named after Faisal's son.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK's Housing Secretary Steve Reed says the first phase of the law requires landlords to investigate other hazards and and confirm them within 10 days, while work to remedy the problem must begin within 12 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(If) Landlords don't meet the requirements of the new legislation they'll find themselves in the dock in court. And they face enforcement action or a fine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther legislation is expected in the next couple of years to cover the safety of homes in the private rented sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Reed has told Sky News that more of Awaab\u2019s Law will be phased in next year and in 2027 to make homes safer from more hazards, alongside work to build 1.5 million new properties, including what he has described as the biggest boost of social and affordable housing in a generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want everybody, whatever kind of property they're renting, to have the assurance that what happens to little Awaab cannot happen to anyone else... You know, Awaab's Law coming into force today is such an important step.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeley has already identified some issues - what he's called pinch points where there could be challenges as social landlords meet their obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there must be an ethical internal complaints procedure that offers opportunities for genuine apologies, and clear and enforceable timeframes as issues are resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Wellingborough, a family is being moved back into their house which has been cleaned of mould.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAN 1: \"Are you happier now?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMAN 2: \"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the new law has come too late for his family, Abdullah still hope the first round of the new law will do some good, especially for families like these.\n\n\n\n",

Selling RAMS allowed the bank to achieve its goals faster and more efficiently, Miller said.",

    "text": "\u201cIt seems very clear that it was more important to you and to your executive team to make sure your corporate ducks were in order, that your profits will be in order, than people\u2019s safety and transparency with government,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give any further update... even when you knew on the Thursday night that it was worse than you had previously informed the government.\u201d Pressed repeatedly on why he didn\u2019t immediately provide updated information about the true number affected or deaths, Rue insisted he \u201cwanted to provide accurate information\u201d but admitted that his call to notify the regulator came nearly 18 hours after learning of the first fatality. Rue also conceded there were delayed welfare checks on at-risk customers as engineers scrambled to manually identify failed emergency calls. In his opening statement, Rue announced that Optus would add 300 people to its Australian call centres focused on Triple Zero customers and would on-shore its network operations from offshore contractors, in response to the catastrophic network failure.\n\nHe said Optus accepted full responsibility for the failures and said he \u201cregretted reforms were not embedded earlier to prevent them\u201d. Loading \u201cWe are all deeply sorry, the tragic deaths of people during this outage will stay with us as individuals and as a company, as we investigate and build on our response while progressing a sweeping transformation of Optus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will add around 300 people to our Australian call centres focused on Triple Zero and vulnerable customers, including our specialist care teams helping customers in rural areas, elderly customers or those with serious medical conditions. \u201cIn May this year, the board approved a management proposal to take back in-house network activities currently performed by Nokia, both onshore and offshore. At the time, the aim was to transition this work progressively to May 2027, but I have now asked the networks team to accelerate the move.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the on-shoring activities in call centres and networks, we are also recruiting 150 people to be part of a new Process Centre of Excellence in Australia, to accelerate the transformation and overall procedures across the business.\u201d Loading Rue pushed back on calls for his resignation that have come from across the political spectrum. \u201cI firmly believe that another change of leader at this time is not what Optus needs or what our customers need. The disruption and uncertainty could actually set back the transformation underway and create further risks,\u201d he said. Optus chair John Arthur backed his chief executive, but promised future consequences for staff responsible for the Triple Zero outage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his job. Now, he\u2019s partway through this job and I\u2019m expecting him to finish it,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cBecause I never in my life want to be in the position I\u2019m in today where I have to answer these sorts of questions about a company I\u2019m associated with.\u201d He said once an internal Optus review, a review by the regulator, and the Senate inquiry were finalised, there would be consequences for both junior and senior staff. \u201cI can assure you that there will be [accountabilities] when the dust settles. And what I mean by that is that when we have all of the facts\u2026 the board will deal with accountabilities.\u201d The crisis stemmed from a botched firewall upgrade at Regency Park exchange in South Australia, where technicians failed to redirect traffic before locking down a critical \u201csession border gateway\u201d, according to Optus\u2019 submission to the inquiry. Optus\u2019 Paul O\u2019Sullivan, former chairman, John Arthur, chairman, and Stephen Rue, CEO, at the Triple Zero service outage hearing at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThe submission reveals Nokia contractors used an outdated procedure document and incorrectly rated the change as \u201czero risk\u201d, bypassing crucial engineering reviews. It states that Nokia personnel selected an \u201coutdated Method of Procedure (MOP) document\u201d for the change. This outdated document \u201cdid not include making changes... to \u2018offload\u2019 traffic from the Session Border Gateway\u201d before applying the lock. Loading The work was also brought forward 24 hours without proper authorisation. Automated alarms for general call failures were generated within minutes of the outage starting. Those alerts, at 12.20am on September 18, were dismissed as routine maintenance activity, while five customer calls reporting Triple Zero failures between 10.13am and 2.57pm went unescalated \u2013 a \u201cserious process issue\u201d that Optus acknowledged was unacceptable.\n\nThe outage wasn\u2019t identified until 1.17pm when South Australian Ambulance Service called Optus directly. Services were restored by 2.34pm, but the damage was done. Efforts to conduct welfare checks on affected customers were then delayed because the technical fault meant that standard Call Detail Records (CDRs) \u201cshowed no unsuccessful calls\u201d. Engineers had to devise new methods to identify affected customers, with the first 100 identified by 7.50pm \u2013 more than five hours after services were restored. A further 524 customers were identified the next morning, followed by seven more days later. Welfare checks didn\u2019t commence until 8.34pm on September 18, with Optus learning of the first fatality at 8.43pm. By Friday afternoon, three deaths had been reported, rising to four by Saturday. The company has appointed former Sydney Water chief executive Dr Kerry Schott to lead an independent review, and engaged consulting firm Kearney to oversee network management improvements. The inquiry continues.",

Combined with its indigenous cooking techniques and abundance of fresh produce and seafood, dining in Fiji is a big part of the reason for visiting. From fine dining beside the ocean to eating traditional dishes in rustic, inexpensive cafes, the dining choices in Fiji are out of this world. MAMANUCA ISLANDS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalamala Beach Club For a dining experience completely different to everything else in Fiji\n\nYou\u2019d come for the novelty factor alone: Malamala Beach Club is the world\u2019s first beach club on its very own island and it\u2019s only half an hour by ferry from Port Denarau. Buy a day pass and hit the spa, and the island\u2019s pools and stunning beaches. Its food offerings have been overshadowed; but this is a heck of a venue for a meal. There\u2019s a choice between restaurants - dine pool-side or opt for the adult\u2019s only area. The chicken curry is one of the best you\u2019ll find in a country famous for them; though the loaded fries (with bacon and beef brisket) are legendary too.\n\nMalamala Island, Mamanuca Islands.

You\u2019ll find local musicians, photos from the South and a menu celebrating Southern barbecue, Creole and Cajun food (don\u2019t go without trying the sizzling baby back ribs or Texas T-bone). It\u2019s a sports bar too \u2013 though families are encouraged to sit where kids can play the giant Jenga blocks.\n\n1342 Hibiscus Drive, Port Harbour, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 992 7453. See restaurantsnapshot.com/BakaBluesCafe Ocean Terrace (Bedarra Beach Inn) Wholesome Fijian fare served in a cosy setting\n\nCentrally located on the Coral Coast, you won\u2019t find better curries anywhere in Fiji (all are served with various home-made chutneys). And yet Ocean Terrace Restaurant is most famous for its local lobster \u2013 cooked in a bisque and laced with brandy. Sit outside on the veranda overlooking the pool to the lagoon beyond for either breakfast, lunch or dinner. Dinner includes candlelight and live music. Don\u2019t go past their coconut pancake rolls with local fish, though their kokoda (raw local fish marinated with coconut milk and lime) shouldn\u2019t be missed.\n\nSunset Strip, Korotogo, Sigatoka, Viti Levu.

Though coffee\u2019s just part of what you\u2019ll get. Run by a local family, most ingredients come straight off the owners\u2019 12 hectare organic farm just outside Nadi (you can take a farm tour), making this a bona fide farm-to-table eatery. The setting\u2019s casual but chic \u2013 art deco with an open-air bar set in a garden outside. Locals love it, so it\u2019s a great way to immerse yourself into the Nadi community away from the resorts of Denarau Island. There\u2019s also an outpost in Suva.\n\nQueens Road, Namaka, Nadi, Viti Levu. Phone: +679 672 8638.

There\u2019s a colonial feel to the open-air, multi-level restaurant beside the beach, with its weatherboard slats and big timber bar (the perfect spot for sunset drinks). Meat and seafood is cooked on a house-built charcoal grill \u2013 most ingredients are sourced locally. The lobster\u2019s a house specialty, and the cocktail list is overwhelming.

And some of the best Indo-Fijian flavours are available at centrally located Indigo Indian Asian Resort on the waterfront at Port Denarau. Try the local masala crab or the musallam of lamb with chillies and spices grown at the restaurant\u2019s own organic farm. There are two separate menus \u2013 Indian and South-East Asian \u2013 so it\u2019s like having two restaurants in one.

    "text": "Trainer Paul Preusker has Geelong Cup-winner Torranzino ready for the Melbourne Cup. Credit: Jason South On Tuesday, just five years after her first race ride in a maiden at Moe in June 2020, she will ride in her first Melbourne Cup aboard the Paul Preusker-trained Torranzino. When the gates open, Gaudray will become just the 11th woman to ride in the Cup\u2019s history. \u201cShe\u2019s gifted in a lot of ways on horseback. She has a good understanding of horse movement, is incredible at riding horses over jumps and jumping big fences on horses bareback,\u201d Carey said. \u201cFor a girl her age she was pretty fearless and ready to advance her riding at an early age. She was a bit daring.\u201d Gaudray has a winning laugh too.\n\nIt lands as regularly as her mounts on raceday (30 per cent of her rides have finished in the placings) and emerges as soon as she recalls the education she had working with Carey and his wife Cheryl as she learnt the skills needed to become a jockey. Carey paired her up with a former racehorse I Maximus, a stable favourite who was smart enough to be reliable but in the trainer\u2019s words, \u201cnot bombproof\u201d. It meant whoever was riding him needed to be on their game when on his back. Gaudray as an apprentice in 2021. Credit: Getty Images \u201cHe was a strong, older horse, but he still knew what a racetrack was and he did bolt off on me a few times and made me a stronger rider,\u201d Gaudray said. Underneath the smile is a tough sportswoman, a person who had a long apprenticeship due to a number of injuries at both track work and in races, finally out-riding her claim this time last year.\n\nIn just her fourth race ride she suffered a fracture in her back and injured her knee when she tumbled off Midas Man on the dirt at Pakenham. Loading Three months later she got right back on the horse, literally, when she rode her first winner on the Carey-trained Tippitywichit at Traralgon. \u201cI had a rough start to my apprenticeship. I had quite a few injuries at track work. Pat had a few scary horses and I would hold on for dear life,\u201d Gaudray said. \u201cDuring that [fourth] race I fractured my back and my knee but before that I did my foot, my knee, my wrist, my coccyx, the list goes on.\u201d\n\nThe run of injuries had nothing to do with her riding ability. Nor did they deter Gaudray, who revelled in the environment and never felt an attack of nerves. \u201cI am super, super competitive. I love winning, I just love going out there and giving my horse every chance to win the race,\u201d Gaudray said. Carey has taught multiple apprentices. He knew Gaudray had what it would take to make it in the often brutal, relentless world of being a jockey.\n\n\u201cFrom the time she started to ride she had polish, she was a good rider. She had to learn about racing. She did not have the racing smarts, but she was a natural for the competition, and she had great style, and she knew horses well,\u201d Carey said. \u201c[She is a] natural lightweight, incredible balance and acrobatic ability, [on the] trampoline, [doing] somersaults and tumbles and very good core strength.\u201d Gaudray at home. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui That strength was on display one day at apprentice school under former jockeys Alf Matthews and Darren Gauci\u2019s tutelage, when she was challenged to an arm wrestle alongside eight of her peers \u2013 a bunch of male and female apprentices. \u201cI wrestled one and beat one and they all wanted to have a go and I beat them all,\u201d Gaudray said.\n\nThe giggle returns as she tells the story. It feels like the laugh is never far away. Loading Her positive outlook has helped her work through the inevitable bumps along the way, her name finding headlines for the wrong reasons before she had really started. She was suspended for three months in 2021 after being part of the now infamous jockeys\u2019 party at a Mornington Airbnb during Victoria\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown, an incident Carey suspects helped Gaudray recognise where the limits were to what she could and couldn\u2019t do in a highly regulated industry. Gaudray doesn\u2019t shy away from the incident but says it\u2019s more the business itself than the incident that has influenced her approach to life.\n\n\u201cIn general this industry ensures you mature quickly just because you are with professional people and there is a lot of money involved and you have to be in top form to get around it all,\u201d Gaudray said. \u201cI would not say that particular event matured me but just racing in general.\u201d Rider Emily Brown takes Torranzino for a run on a bush track. Credit: Jason South Cup-winning rider Michelle Payne is a fan. She was rapt to see Gaudray land a ride in the Cup. \u201cShe is a very good rider. She\u2019s very likeable as a person and a rider so that helps obviously to gain opportunities and then you just need a bit of luck on your side. I was the same age when I had my first ride for Bart Cummings [in 2009 on Allez Wonder] and all those feelings came back,\u201d Payne said.\n\nThose who know Gaudray well say she is quiet and happiest with her showjumping horses such as Felix and her fiance Ethan Brown, who will ride Ciaron Maher\u2019s Middle Earth in the Cup. That laugh returns when asked whether that is true as Gaudray admits she is not sure Brown is happiest around her horses. \u201cEthan doesn\u2019t really like it, but he will come wherever I drag him to,\u201d Gaudray said. Such cheekiness has probably helped her to connect with Torranzino, a lightweight Cup chance that can be difficult to ride. Gaudray says Preusker, who trained Surprise Baby into fifth place in the 2019 Cup and 13th in 2020, has done a remarkable job to unlock the six-year-old gelding\u2019s talent.\n\n\u201cHe was not an easy horse early doors \u2026 this time in, he has got rid of all those bad habits and I feel like I have formed a really good relationship with the horse and I feel like we get on really well,\u201d Gaudray said. Carey says many people at Racing Victoria, the apprentice school and her peers have helped Gaudray realise her talent. He is an admirer and proud that the apprentices who pass through his stable can still walk in the back door of his house and make themselves at home. Gaudray remains grateful and connected to those who have helped along the way. \u201cPat was the ultimate best master I could have had. I always pop in and have a cup of coffee with him,\u201d she said. Carey remains in her corner, his family a solid base for the young people as they mature. But as Tuesday beckons he knows Gaudray will handle the moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to pat them on the back when they are winning but the most important thing is to be there to support them when it all falls apart,\u201d Carey said. Loading \u201cIt is a mentally tortuous business where you are getting heat from a lot of different areas. One thing about Celine is she is mentally tough and able to cope. She is not phased by the enormity of the task.\u201d Payne remains the only woman to have ridden a Melbourne Cup winner but Gaudray, Jamie Melham and Rachel King are as good a chance as any heading to the barriers on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d Gaudray said.",

    "text": "He was surrounded by hardline China hawks in that first term. They wanted to cut off access to leading-edge US technology, notably advanced semiconductors, to try to hobble China\u2019s rapid development of 21st century technologies. They saw Trump\u2019s tariffs through a national security lens. When that trade stoush ended in 2020 with Trump\u2019s \u201cfirst phase\u201d deal \u2013 with China agreeing to buy more US products, notably oil and soybeans \u2013 some of Trump\u2019s tariffs and trade restrictions were left in place. There\u2019s now a level of global mistrust in the US that will outlive the Trump presidency. Credit: Getty Images The Biden administration maintained them and significantly tightened the restrictions on semiconductor exports in a \u201csmall yard, high fence\u201d policy stance that was far more heavily tilted towards national security than the trade balance. In Trump\u2019s second term, threats of even tighter technology restrictions appear less driven by national security concerns than by Trump\u2019s fixation with US trade deficits, his suspicion that those deficits reveal something sinister (rather than a US savings rate that is lower than it needs to be to finance American living standards) and his desire to use his beloved tariffs as leverage to do commercial deals. He does love a deal.\n\nHe got one last week, one that injects a pause of at least 12 months into the US-China trade conflict. The US got a promise of some soybean purchases by China, Xi\u2019s pledge to try to throttle the supply of precursor chemicals used in fentanyl production and an agreement that China wouldn\u2019t implement its tighter controls of rare earth and magnet exports while the truce is in place. Loading China won a winding back of the extension of America\u2019s \u201cblack list\u201d of Chinese companies to cover subsidiaries, which would have expanded the number of companies prohibited from acquiring advanced US technologies from about 1300 to more than 20,000. It was only the announcement of the vastly increased list \u2013 in breach, China thought, of a standstill agreement reached earlier this year \u2013 that caused it to toughen its restrictions on rare earths and magnets.\n\nThe US has agreed to halve the 20 per cent tariff on China\u2019s exports related to its role in fentanyl production and also to halt the imposition of steep port fees on Chinese ships docking at US ports. (China has similarly removed its retaliatory duties on US-financed ships using its ports.) What the deal struck last week highlights is the imbalance in power within the trade relationship. Trump thought access to America\u2019s vast consumer marketplace gave him unmatchable leverage \u2013until Xi responded by threatening to use its near-monopoly on the rare earths and rare earth magnets to almost instantly cripple US manufacturing and its defence capabilities. By slashing China\u2019s purchases of soybeans from farmers in Trump\u2019s midwestern political strongholds to zero in the current harvest season, Xi also showed he understands how to exploit the vulnerability of politicians in a democracy. Those soybean farmers were becoming increasingly desperate and angry.\n\nIt will take the US and its allies up to a decade to build the mines and processing infrastructure that would shield them from China\u2019s stranglehold over critical minerals. Meanwhile, Xi has a far more potent weapon in his trade arsenal than anything Trump can call on; one he can roll out anytime the US tries to flex its muscles. It\u2019s not the only one. China has an equally dominant position in, for instance, some key pharmaceutical products and ingredients and has the best part of a decade, and the advantages provided by a state-directed economy that is less concerned about productive uses of national capital than in its geopolitical ambitions, to develop other areas of dominance. What began as an attack on China\u2019s exports to the US, along with an effort to stifle its technological advancements, also developed into a trade war on everyone else. China might have agreed to buy 12 million tonnes of soybeans from the US this season (though it has already secured supplies into the first part of next year) and 25 million tonnes a year for three years, but it bought about 22.5 million tonnes in the same harvest period last year. Before Trump\u2019s 2018-19 trade war, China used to buy more than 40 per cent of the US crop. If it makes good on last week\u2019s commitments, it will buy less than 25 per cent.\n\nChina has demonstrated that it can acquire all the beans it needs from Brazil, where it helped develop soybean production and the infrastructure to export it after the 2018-19 trade war, and more recently Argentina. Where its soybeans once represented trade leverage for the US, the roles have now been reversed. After Trump\u2019s truly great deal with China, China still has an effective average tariff rate of about 47 per cent, though most of that relates to tariffs imposed during Trump\u2019s 2018-19 trade war. Loading Leaving those aside, it still has a 10 per cent fentanyl-related tariff, a 10 per cent \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff and exposures to Trump\u2019s global sectoral tariffs which, relative to where it stood when Trump regained office, actually leaves it better positioned against other trading nations, who generally face US tariffs of 15 to 20 per cent (though some are 50 per cent) than it was back in February. This week, the US Supreme Court will start hearing a case brought against Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, which could force the unwinding of his reciprocal tariffs and potentially the return of billions of dollars of duties already collected.",

    "text": "Massive changes to how Territorians and millions of Aussies receive healthcare are now in place.\n\nThe changes impact Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), two core pillars of Australia\u2019s healthcare system, and also aged care.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nBULK BILLING\n\nBulk billing means a visit to the doctor is completely free.\n\nThe government pays the doctor a fee for your visit, called a Medicare rebate, rather than you paying the doctor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut a lot of GP clinics don\u2019t operate on full bulk billing, which means Aussies sometimes have to shell out some money on their visit to a practice.\n\nThis is sometimes called a \u201cgap fee\u201d or an \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d cost.\n\nThat\u2019s because clinics are businesses and some doctors don\u2019t receive enough revenue from government bulk billing fees to cover their costs.\n\nBut now, the government is trying to change all that by ramping up incentives for doctors to provide bulk billing.\n\nIt\u2019s called the Bulk Billing Practice Incentive Program.\n\nThe government is trying to encourage more doctors to bulk bill. Picture: Supplied\n\nWHAT IS CHANGING?\n\nSimply put, the government is increasing the Medicate rebate and incentive payments it pays to doctors, hoping more doctors will be incentivised to offer patients full bulk billing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBelow is a table that shows the current rebate levels and the new total payments that a bulk-billing practice would receive under the scheme.\n\nNote, the totals include the Medicare rebate, the bulk-billing incentive item rebate and a 12.5 per cent bulk-billing practice incentive program payment.\n\nThe increases are substantial.

It releases a combination of oestrogen and progestogen to prevent ovulation and is used on a monthly cycle, offering an alternative to daily oral contraceptives.\n\nBefore the PBS listing, women might have paid more than $270 a year for the option.\n\nNow, they will pay $31.60 per script or $7.70 with a concession.\n\nEach script covers three months of contraception, so the listing essentially cuts the price of the conceptive by half.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPrices will decrease further from January 1 to a maximum of $25 per script.\n\n\u201cFor too long, women\u2019s health needs were sidelined, but the Albanese government is changing that and delivering more choice, lower costs and better health care,\u201d Health Minister Mark Butler said.\n\n\u201cAustralia has one of the lowest uptake rates in the developed world of long-acting contraceptives, partly due to access and affordability.\n\n\u201cThese changes to MBS and expanded options though the PBS will remove cost and access barriers so that more women can choose the contraceptive option that works best for them.\u201d\n\nAGED CARE\n\nLast year, the government passed the Aged Care Act 2024, changing how support for the elderly is funded.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe government will fully fund all clinical care for people in aged care homes, but older people will be required to make means-tested co-contributions for their non-clinical care and everyday living services, according to the Older Person Advocacy Network.\n\nEveryday services include meals, cleaning and laundry, while non-clinical care includes personal care and mobility assistance.\n\nContributions will be capped at $105.30 a day, or $135,318 over a lifetime, for non-clinical care.\n\nSupport for older people living at home also changes.\n\nA new Support at Home program replaces the older Home Care Packages program and the Short-Term Restorative Care program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSupport at Home has eight funding classifications, ranging from about $11,000 a year to $78,000 a year, an OPAN fact sheet states.\n\nThe Aged Care Act 2024 changes how aged care is funded and also tries to improve protections for the elderly. Picture: Supplied\n\nRecipients receive a budget aligned with their assessed funding classification.\n\n\u201cRecipients will work with their aged care provider to allocate their budget across three broad service categories, tailored to their needs,\u201d the fact sheet states.\n\nClinical supports, such as nursing and physiotherapy\n\nIndependence services, including personal care, respite care, transport and social support\n\nEveryday living services, such as cleaning, gardening, and meal delivery\n\nThe government fill cover the cost of clinical supports, but older people will make contributions to the \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201ceveryday living\u201d buckets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nContribution levels depend on income and asset assessments by Services Australia.\n\nAlongside changes to funding models, the Act tries to entrench safety and decision-making power for older people.\n\nFor one, the legislation enshrines protection for whistleblowers, including older people, families or aged care workers who report a person or organisation that has not followed the Aged Care law.\n\nWhistleblowers can make reports anonymously to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, the federal health department, a registered provider or aged care worker, a police officer or an independent aged care advocate.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cIf someone makes a report, they will be protected from any negative results that come from making the report,\u201d the government states.\n\n\u201c(And) Have their identities or identifying information protected, with some exceptions \u2013 for example, where it is necessary to share information with the ACQSC or a lawyer or to prevent a serious threat to a person or people.\u201d",
