    "text": "The Coalition has kicked off its 2025 federal election campaign in Sydney with several major cost-of-living measures announced.\n\nOpposition Leader \ufeffPeter Dutton today already unveiled his plan to deliver a once-off $1200 tax relief and used the campaign launch to announce his landmark tax policy to ease mortgage stress.\n\nWatch the Liberal Party's federal election campaign launch above\n\nAt today's official campaign launch, attended by three former Liberal prime ministers, Dutton responded to Labor's housing plan with a pledge to provide annual mortgage interest rate relief on up to $650,000 of a home loan.\n\nPeter Dutton at the Liberal Party campaign launch launch at the Liverpool Catholic Club. (James Brickwood)\n\nMortgage relief of up to $12,000 for first homebuyers\n\nThe opposition leader today declared himself as the \"prime minister who restores the dream of home ownership\".\ufeff\n\nDutton then unveiled his plan to allow first-time homeowners of newly-built properties to deduct mortgage interest payments from their taxable income.\n\nDutton said an elected Coalition government would implement this major tax change which could save the average household with a taxable income of $120,000 around $12,000 per year for up to five years.\n\nThe scheme is limited to five years, is against only the first \ufeff$650,000 of a home loan and is means-tested with income caps of $175,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples.\n\n\"We will allow these deductions for five-years, provided you continue to live in that home for that period,\" Dutton said.\n\n\"I will be a prime minister who restores the dream of home ownership.\" (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOnce-off $1200 tax relief for millions of Aussies\n\nAhead of today's official campaign launch, Dutton responded to Labor's housing plan with a pledge to give 10 \ufeffmillion Australians a $1200 tax cut in the next financial year.\n\nDutton said an elected Coalition government would deliver a once-off Cost of Living Tax Offset for eligible Australians earning up to $144,000 when they lodge their tax return.\n\nAround 85 per cent of all workers would be eligible for this temporary tax relief.\n\nAround half of all taxpayers would receive the full $1200 offset,\ufeff which would cost the government $10 billion.\n\nThese tax cuts would also save families with two incomes up to $2,400.\n\nDutton said this once-off tax relief policy would be vital support for families struggling against a tough economic climate.\n\nThe Coalition has promised a $1200 once-off tax relief for millions of Australians. (Getty)\n\n\"A Coalition government will first provide help to families by cutting fuel by 25 cents a litre \u2013 a saving of about $1500 a year for a two car family,\" Dutton said today.\n\n\"And then by giving back up to $2400 per family whilst we clean up Labor's mess. Labor's 70c a day is a band-aid on a bullet wound.\"\n\nDutton used his policy announcement to take aim at the federal government's modest tax cut announced in the 2025 Federal Budget, which amounts to around 70c per day.\n\n\"Our Cost of Living Tax Offset will put more money back into the pockets of millions of Australians at a time when they're being crushed by skyrocketing grocery bills, rent, mortgage repayments and insurance costs,\" he added.\n\nShadow Treasurer Angus Taylor said the Coalition is committed to delivering a \"comprehensive\" plan to rebuild the economy and to target cost of living.\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\"The Coalition's approach is different \u2013 we will provide temporary and targeted cost of living relief while we get our economy back on track,\" he said.\n\n\"We will restore responsible economic management, deliver a plan to lower electricity and gas bills, and restore prosperity for working Australians.\"\n\nFormer Australian prime ministers Scott Morrison and Tony Abbott at the LNP campaign launch. (James Brickwood)\n\nScrapping family car and ute\ufeff tax\n\nDutton\ufeff said the Coalition will axe Labor's family car and ute tax, which he said would save families $9700 for choosing a RAV4 hybrid model or $14,400 for a Ford Ranger.\n\n\"Australians shouldn't be penalised for choosing to buy a petrol, diesel or hybrid vehicle over an EV,\" he said.\n\n\"Indeed, we will save Australians an average of $2,300 per vehicle.\"\n\nUsing super to buy a house\ufeff\n\nThe opposition leader also reaffirmed his earlier promise to allow Australians to pull up t $50,000 from their superannuation accounts to pay for a house deposit.\n\nHe said Australians should be able to access their retirement funds whenever they want.\n\n\"Your super is your money \u2013 not the government's,\" he said.\n\n\"\ufeffWe will also work with the prudential regulator to ease rigid and overly-strict lending criteria,\" he added.\n\n\"And that will result in tens-of-thousands more Australians being able to get a home loan.\"\n\nA $20 billion 'Regional Australia Future Fund'\n\nThe Coalition has pledged a $20 billion fund to invest in regional, remote and rural Australian communities.\n\nNationals Leader David Littleproud championed this policy today at the Liberal Party's campaign launch and said the Coalition would ensure no Australian is left behind.\n\nLittleproud said the multibillion-dollar fund would invest in childcare, improving healthcare access and funding roads and infrastructure in regional communities.\n\n\"I got into politics in regional Queensland because I was sick of seeing young people go over the divide,\" Littleproud said.\n\nNationals leader David Littleprouid championed Dutton's $20 billion regional future fund. (James Brickwood)\n\n\"It's time to bring them home and to keep them home - to know that they have a future in regional Australia, because you're going to have a government that believes in you, and that's the legacy that Peter Dutton and I intend to leave for regional Australia.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government announced a plan to tackle the housing crisis with a $10 billion package to deliver 100,000 affordable homes to first homebuyers.\n\nLabor also said it would raise the income and price cap to make all first homebuyers eligible for a five per cent deposit on a property.\ufeff",

US Treasuries are historically considered to be the safest of safe assets, backed up by the full faith and credit of the US government.\n\nBut bonds aren't rising \u2014 they're falling.\n\nThat's largely because investors have lost faith in US trade policy, and they fear America could get hurt even worse than the countries Trump's tariff policy is targeting.\n\nUS Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, briefly surged on Friday above 4.5 per cent. (CNN)\n\nAs JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday, Trump's \"America First\" policy risks alienating its most important partners and the country's special standing in the world.\n\nUS Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, briefly surged on Friday above 4.5 per cent. They were under 4 per cent earlier in the week.\n\nThat represents a massive move for the market.

(AP)\n\nOil prices have served as a prime recession indicator in recent years. Prices tumbled after surging above $US100 ($160) a barrel for the first time as the Great Recession took hold in 2008.\n\nAnd prices went negative for the first time during the pandemic as a glut of oil became so severe that traders were literally paying storage facilities to take the unwanted oil off their hands.\n\nDollar\n\nThe dollar on Friday tumbled to its lowest level in three years. That's the opposite of what you'd expect when tariffs are put in place.\n\nTypically, tariffs raise the value of a local currency, because it encourages residents to purchase homemade goods instead of foreign options, stretching their money further in comparison to other currencies.\n\nBut currency traders have sold off the dollar, because they believe America will bear the brunt of Trump's trade war fallout and end up comparatively weaker than before tariffs were put in place.\n\nThe dollar on Friday hit its lowest level against the euro since 2022.\n\nREAD MORE: Remains of dozens of First Nations ancestors return home\n\nCurrency traders have sold off the dollar, because they believe America will bear the brunt of Trump's trade war fallout.

The yellow metal is considered a safe haven amid economic and political uncertainty.\n\nTrade deals\n\nDespite financial markets casting enormous doubt that the Trump administration can salvage the opportunity it created for itself to strike bilateral trade agreements with all 150 countries around the world, the Trump administration remains optimistic.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that more than 70 countries have asked to meet with US representatives to strike a deal that could get them out from under the thumb of Trump's punishing tariffs.\n\nAlthough the administration has provided few details of which countries it is negotiating with, it said it would favor allies like South Korea and Japan first.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that more than 70 countries have asked to meet with US representatives to strike a deal. (AP)\n\nBut trade deals are incredibly complex arrangements usually negotiated over the course of years, not months.\n\nAnd even if Trump were to negotiate trade with all those countries over a short period \u2014 whether full deals or letters of agreement that put a framework of a deal together \u2014 China, the world's biggest exporter, remains the elephant in the room.\n\nUS tariffs on China are now at least 145 per cent and China on Friday retaliated with 125 per cent tariffs of its own.\n\nThat will do enormous damage to the world's two largest economies, and both sides have said they are not eager to back down.\n\nChina has consistently said it is open to negotiations, but wants to do it in a way in which it will be respected.\n\nChina has ignored America's warnings not to raise its tariffs, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n\nEconomists have been unmoved by Trump's sudden change in tune. (AP)\n\nIn the meantime, economists have been unmoved by Trump's sudden change in tune. Although negotiated trade agreements would undoubtedly be good news for the economy, much of the damage has already been done, Wall Street economists have argued.\n\nAnd punishing 10 per cent universal tariffs remain in place, as do 25 per cent tariffs on autos, 25 per cent tariffs on some goods from Mexico and Canada, and 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum.",

    "text": "(Channel Nine)\n\nThe fallout from Spencer Leniu's confrontation with Johnathan Thurston on Friday night continues, with Channel Nine releasing video the commentator's post-match conversation with Roosters coach Trent Robinson.\n\nThe audio becomes clearer midway through the discussion in the tunnel at Lang Park after the Roosters' 26-16 win over the Broncos, with an agitated Thurston talking to Robinson alongside captain James Tedesco.\n\nRobinson: Everybody went after him. To be called racism \u2026 [unintelligible] Thurston: I never said that though. Robinson: I don't know what you said, I'm just saying \u2026 Thurston: I said I don't believe he's a racist. I just said I don't think the punishment fits the crime.\n\nAfter Leniu called Broncos five-eighth Ezra Mam a \"monkey\" during the 2024 round-one clash in Las Vegas, Thurston said Leniu's \"racial abuse\" should have elicited a more severe punishment \"to make a stand, not only for the game but for society as well\".\n\nLoading...\n\nOn Friday night, Robinson said the conversation was simply \"two guys having a conversation\" and \"nothing wrong was said\".\n\nBut Thurston, in a statement, said Leniu \"made an abusive comment to me, which took me and those around me by surprise\".\n\n\"The comment was not of a racial nature but was overly aggressive in tone and unwarranted,\" Thurston said.\n\n\"After the match, I approached Spencer on the field to seek clarity on what he said and why he had said it. Spencer was again overly aggressive, and it became clear that he had interpreted the comments I made 12 months ago as a personal attack on him, which was not the case.\"\n\nThurston said he is open to further discussions with Leniu.",

    "text": "These words were written 14 years ago:\n\n\"Serious economic and financial mismanagement by the United States is the one thing that could precipitate flight from the dollar. \"And serious mismanagement, recent events remind us, is not something that can be ruled out. \"We may yet suffer a dollar crash, but only if we bring it on ourselves. The Chinese are not going to do it to us.\"\n\nBarry Eichengreen, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, published that passage in the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis.\n\nAnd they came to mind last week when Martin Whetton, the head of Westpac's financial markets strategy, made a startling observation about the current chaos in our global economy.\n\nDonald Trump met his match. It's called the bond market Photo shows trump dinner The US president was confronted by a force far greater than his own and the office he now holds overnight. The bond market, an arena where brutality knows no bounds and where the participants take no prisoners.\n\nMr Whetton said it was \"staggering\" to witness on Wednesday last week, in the market dysfunction triggered by Donald Trump's tariffs, how traders had stopped treating the United States as a financial safe haven.\n\nHe said he'd never seen anything like it.\n\nHe said it signalled the end of US exceptionalism and \"exorbitant privilege.\"\n\n\"The US has enjoyed the prime position in global finance since the end of WW2, cemented with Bretton Woods a generation ago,\" he said.\n\n\"Giving [up] that hegemony, that authority, that liquidity and reserve status \u2026 perhaps not willingly, but flippantly and without due consideration, is not something you just 'get back'.\"\n\nWhen he shared his thoughts on the extraordinary situation, in a note on Thursday, he gave his note a tombstone inscription: \"Exorbitant privilege: 1946-2025.\"\n\nIt emphasised the point he was making.\n\nAnd his note quickly circulated through Australia's community of market analysts and economists, with many people agreeing with him.\n\nWhat is exorbitant privilege?\n\nWhile analysts debate Mr Whetton's argument, it's worth understanding what he meant by \"exorbitant privilege.\"\n\nGiven everything that's happening in Trump's America, it may help to explain some of the trading behaviour we'll see in financial markets in coming years.\n\nProfessor Eichengreen explained the concept in his 2011 book, \"Exorbitant Privilege: The rise and fall of the dollar and the future of the international monetary system.\"\n\nIt's where the quotes at the top of this piece come from.\n\nThe phrase \"exorbitant privilege\" was coined in the 1960s by Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing (then French minister of finance), to refer to the financial privileges the US has enjoyed in the post-World War II era, due to its currency being the international reserve currency.\n\nHow did the US currency become the world's reserve currency?\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, a new international monetary system was created.\n\nUnder the new system, dozens of countries agreed to peg their currencies to the US dollar (directly or indirectly), while the US dollar was pegged to the price of gold.\n\nIt was designed that way to replace the old rigid gold standard, which had disintegrated in the Depression, with a more flexible system.\n\n\"In practice, however, the system afforded the greatest flexibility to the United States, which enjoyed substantial freedom to pursue its domestic policy objectives as well as the ability to run sustained balance-of-payments deficits,\" Ben Bernanke, a former US Federal Reserve chair, has pointed out.\n\nThat's the gist of it.\n\nWhat kind of privileges are there?\n\nNow, as Eichengreen explains, with the US economy sitting at the centre of the global system in the post-war period, the US dollar became the most important currency for invoicing and settling international transactions, including for imports and exports that never touched the shores of the United States.\n\nHe says it made sense to do things that way when the US economy accounted for more than half of the combined economic output of the so-called 'Great Powers' immediately after the war.\n\nBut that situation gave the US financial privileges.\n\nTrump is out to destroy the global economic order Photo shows Donald trump standing in front of the american flag Donald Trump's tariffs are not a negotiation tactic. They are a very deliberate plan to destroy the liberal global trading and financial system the US itself established.\n\n\"America being far and away the largest importer and main source of trade credit, it made sense for imports and exports to be denominated in dollars,\" he explains in his book.\n\n\"Since the United States was the leading source of foreign capital, it made sense that international financial business was transacted in dollars.\n\n\"And with these same considerations encouraging central banks to stabilise their currencies against the dollar, it made sense that they should hold dollars in reserve in case of a problem, in foreign exchange markets.\"\n\nUnder such a system, since there was so much demand for dollar-denominated assets, it meant the US could borrow at lower interest rates than other countries and pursue domestic and foreign policies with more freedom.\n\n\"This effect is substantial,\" Eichengreen wrote in his book. \"The interest rate that the United States must pay on its foreign liabilities is two to three percentage points less than the rate of return on its foreign investments. \"The US can run an external deficit in the amount of this difference, importing more than it exports and consuming more than it produces year after year without becoming more indebted to the rest of the world. \"Or it can scoop up foreign companies in that amount as the result of the dollar's singular status as the world's currency. \"This has long been a sore point for foreigners, who see themselves as supporting American living standards and subsidising American multinationals through the operation of this asymmetric financial system.\"\n\nAre there more exorbitant privileges? Yes, there are.\n\nAccording to Mr Eichengreen, another benefit for the US is the real resources other countries have to provide the United States to obtain US dollars.\n\n\"It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries have to pony up $100 of actual goods and services in order to obtain one,\" he wrote.\n\nAnd there are others.\n\nIn the post-war period, traders have traditionally flocked to the US during periods of economic and financial crisis, and that has even happened when the crisis has been created by the US itself.\n\n\"In 2008, in the throes of the most serious financial crisis in 80 years, the [US] government was able to borrow vast sums at low interest rates because foreigners figured that the dollar was the safest currency to be in at a time of great turmoil,\" he wrote.\n\n\"And again in the spring of 2010, when financial volatility spiked, investors flew into the most liquid market, that for US treasury bonds, pushing down the cost of borrowing for the US government and, along with it, the mortgage interest rates to American households.\n\n\"This is what exorbitant privilege is all about,\" he said.\n\nA world of multiple reserve currencies\n\nThe post-war financial system has evolved significantly since the 1940s, and the US's economic dominance has weakened as countries such as China have risen.\n\nThere's a debate about how significant the US's exorbitant privilege is nowadays (which often highlights how the system has come with costs for the US too).\n\nWall Street vs Main Street: Why markets matter more than you think Photo shows Wall Street sign with the American flag on the New York Stock Exchange behind With trillions of dollars wiped off global markets, the impact extends beyond stock exchanges into the broader economy. Here's why the effects have a much quicker transmission process into our everyday lives than they once did.\n\nWith the creation of the Euro, the US's reserve currency status has also had a small and imperfect competitor in recent decades (with ambitions to enjoy its own exorbitant privileges).\n\nBut Mr Whetton's point, that we saw something historic last week when traders uncharacteristically turned away from the US during a moment of extreme market dysfunction, is obviously worth noting.\n\nWhat does it mean for the future?\n\nIn 2011, Mr Eichengreen argued we should all be preparing for a multi-polar world with multiple reserve currencies.\n\n\"Aside from the very peculiar second half of the twentieth century, there has always been more than one international currency,\" he wrote.\n\n\"There is no reason that a few years from now countries on China's border could not use the renminbi in their international transactions, while countries in Europe's neighbourhood use the euro, and countries doing business with the United States use the dollar.\"\n\nGiven last week's financial market dysfunction, has the world taken a substantial step towards that future?",

    "text": "Independent MP Monique Ryan says she doesn't have an opinion on whether influencer content paid for by politicians should be clearly labelled as such, after fellow \"teal\" Allegra Spender revealed she had paid for posts.\n\nMs Spender, who represents the seat of Wentworth in Sydney's eastern suburbs, this week confirmed she had paid an agency for posts by content creator and mental health advocate Milly Rose Bannister.\n\nThe posts, which included a video in which Ms Bannister shadowed the MP in parliament for a day, included a disclosure that they were \"made in collaboration\" with Ms Spender and Climate200.\n\nQuestions were raised over the transparency of the posts, after the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) advised that politicians must add a political authorisation to influencer posts that have been paid for. There is no specific requirement for the word \"authorised\" to be included in the statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Ms Spender's campaign told the ABC that their advice was that the authorisation on the posts \"meets all requirements of the AEC\".\n\nAppearing on Insiders on Sunday, Ms Ryan said she had not paid influencers to make content.\n\nBut she stopped short of offering an opinion on the actions of her fellow independent, saying it was important for politicians to engage with young people on social media.\n\n\"We pay to generate the content we put to the voters. Not sure there's an issue there,\" she said.\n\nOn the question of whether influencer content that has been paid for by politicians should be clearly marked as such, Ms Ryan said she hadn't given the issue \"great thought\", leading to a prolonged exchange.\n\n\"I don't have an opinion on it,\" she said.\n\n\"I have to give it thought.

It is opening the door for social media personalities to have increasing political influence.\n\nAfter she was asked whether that meant she might be OK with politicians paying for content without voters being aware, she added: \"I think that's potentially been happening for a long time.\"\n\n\"I think media diversity and the way that our media works in this country is something that would certainly merit greater examination and something we can talk about.\"\n\nThe AEC told ABC the purpose of authorisation statements is for voters to know who is behind a message, but said electoral laws do not ban paid content with third parties.\n\n\"There are no laws that prevent people being funded to put out messages or communicate on behalf of, or in collaboration with, a political entity,\" an AEC spokesperson told the ABC.\n\n\"It would only be a technical question of whether the specific statement meets the requirements.\"\n\nAustralia needs to diversify defence interests: Ryan\n\nEarlier in the interview, Ms Ryan also suggested it \"is time for us to think about diversifying\" Australia's defence interests after she joined calls earlier this week for a parliamentary inquiry into the AUKUS project.\n\n\"The unpredictability and chaotic nature of global politics in the last few months is a call really for all of us to look at our positioning as a nation,\" she said.\n\n\"And to think about the fact that the US might not always be \u2026 a country which works to act in our best interests, both in trade and defence, and I think it is time for us to think about diversifying our interests as a country.\"\n\nShe said voters in her electorate of Kooyong in Melbourne were concerned that the AUKUS submarines would not materialise and \"that we are wasting potentially $400 billion or more on a partnership which won't pay off in the way that we need it to down the track\".\n\n\"So they are asking, reasonably, I think, what are the other options and what else should we be thinking about?\"\n\nThe AUKUS project is expected to cost $368 billion and deliver Australia eight new nuclear submarines, with the first five due by the middle of the 2050s.\n\nKooyong was a safe Coalition seat until the last election, when Ms Ryan defeated then treasurer Josh Frydenberg.\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

Finally the Tigers hit up Tom Lynch deep in the right forward pocket - and the Richmond full forward drills it from near the boundary! What a kick, what a goal and the Tigers are in front again! The teams are back out A By Andrew McGarry The hot conditions at Lyndoch has led to both teams going to the sheds at quarter time to stay cool. We'll see which team handles the conditions better as the game goes on. Umpire Paul Rebeschini is back out there A By Andrew McGarry That's a relief - umpire Paul Rebeschini is back on the ground after he was cleaned up in the first quarter. I'm sure he's sore but glad he's been ruled ok to continue. QT stats A By Andrew McGarry Disposals: Richmond 103-80 Inside 50s: Fremantle 16-9 Clearances: Fremantle 14-10 Centre Clearances: Fremantle 5-4 Contested Possessions: Fremantle 35-30 Uncontested Possessions: Richmond 70-44 Marks inside 50: Fremantle 5-1 Tackles: Fremantle 17-10 The stat that stands out is the five marks inside 50 for Fremantle to one for Richmond. If that trend keeps going, it's not going to be good for the Tiges. QT: Fremantle 4.4 (28) leads Richmond 4.2 (26) A By Andrew McGarry A late chance for Richmond led to a rushed behind, but the siren goes to end an exciting quarter. Lots of lead changes, and some different modes of attack. Richmond will be happy with their start, but they have to find a way of stopping Josh Treacy, who seems to have his mind set on single-handedly working over the Tigers. Dockers retake the lead A By Andrew McGarry The Dockers hit the front again! They had repeat forward entries, and forced a holding the ball call. Murphy Reid kicks Freo's fourth, and they lead by three points. Tough afternoon for the umpire A By Andrew McGarry It's not just a physical game for the players - umpire Paul Rebeschini was minding his business and watching the play when he collided with Richmond's Jayden Short and was left winded on the ground. He got up and tried to continue, but he's been told he has to go off and for now we are down to three umpires for the game! Josh Treacy misses a chance for four in a quarter! A By Andrew McGarry What did we say about Josh Treacy? The Dockers are targeting him like no one's business, and he took another mark in attack, but his kick from distance in front just drifted wide. The strategy seems to be working for Freo, though. Shai Bolton just misses out on a big hanger! A By Andrew McGarry That was exciting! Shai Bolton went up for a BIG leap, and came down with the ball but it spilled before he hit the ground. The Tigers defender caught him with his hip in mid-air, so the free was given rather than the mark. #Boo Josh Treacy is having a big start to his day A By Andrew McGarry Josh Treacy has three early goals for Fremantle (Getty Images / AFL Photos) The Tigers will want to find a way to keep Josh Treacy quiet - the Dockers' tall target is looking so dangerous so far. Richmond back in front A By Andrew McGarry There was a bit of everything in that - Richmond were attacking, but a poor kick was chopped off by Brennan Cox in D50. Unfortunately for Freo his clearing kick sailed too long and was intercepted, Richmond got it to Tyler Sonsie, who marked on 50 and went back and nailed the kick! Another lead change, it's Richmond by 5. There is no hanging around here A By Andrew McGarry This game is being played at a breakneck pace, we've had six goals in a dozen minutes and neither defence looks too comfortable out there. The Dockers have taken three marks inside 50 - and they've all led to goals! We have a shootout early on! A By Andrew McGarry That was much needed for Freo. They moved it down the far wing, before a long kick to Josh Treacy. The Dockers spearhead marked and goaled. And now they've done it again! It was like deja vu with another break down the wing and a kick long to the square from Shai Bolton. Treacy was isolated again, and he couldn't be moved off the ball. He snaps his third, and scores are level! Tigers on fire in the Barossa! A By Andrew McGarry This is worrying for Fremantle - the Tigers are taking it out of the middle with impunity. That time they earned a downfield free, but Seth Campbell couldn't finish. But this is really dangerous for Freo. Back-to-back goals for Richmond! A By Andrew McGarry The Tigers are definitely trying to go direct with the aid of this big breeze. First a move down the corridor led to a goal from Kamdyn McIntosh, and then another move with slick handball and a kick inside 50 saw Maurice Rioli take a grab. He kicks his second, and Richmond lead by 11! An early miss from Shai Bolton! A By Andrew McGarry That was lucky for Richmond - they were trying to find an avenue to go long, but the ball was smothered and turned over. It came to Shai Bolton, who ran to 50 and unloaded ... but it missed to the right. It shows how dangerous he is, though. Fremantle answers through Josh Treacy A By Andrew McGarry Fremantle had been under pressure in the opening minutes, but they got moving there! They went off half-back from a turnover, taking the game on, and a great set up from Karl Worner found Andrew Brayshaw, and his long kick to the hotspot found Josh Treacy. A strong mark, and a great kick! Scores level after two minutes. What a start for Richmond! A By Andrew McGarry Less than 20 seconds on the board and Richmond are on the board! The Tigers grabbed the centre clearance, kicked long to a contest - it fell to Maurice Rioli who snapped one from 20 or so out. Great boost for the Tigers. We're underway for Tigers vs Dockers! A By Andrew McGarry Here we go at Barossa Park, the Tigers win the toss and will kick with the breeze in the first quarter. The Suns managed to succeed against the breeze yesterday - can the Dockers do the same? Let's see! Show more posts",

    "text": "Growing up, Scott Avery showed no signs of hearing loss.\n\nHis life as \"the deaf guy\" began at 13, with a trip to the principal's office.\n\n\"I'm walking down going, 'OK, what am I getting stitched up for now?'\" he recalled.\n\nIt was during this visit that he learnt the results of his latest school hearing test, which revealed that he was profoundly deaf.\n\nHe was diagnosed with otosclerosis, a hereditary condition that causes hearing loss as a spongy bone forms in the middle ear during puberty.\n\nDr Scott, as he is affectionately known, is now an educator, researcher, adviser and rights advocate from the First Nations disability community.\n\nDr Scott at his PhD graduation ceremony in 2022, with his daughter Tegan (left) and wife Alison (right). (Supplied: Scott Avery)\n\nBased in Gadigal Country/Sydney, Dr Scott is an Aboriginal man, descended from the Worimi people, of the Port Stephens and Great Lakes region of New South Wales.\n\nEven after his diagnosis of otosclerosis, he didn't feel it had any impact on his school or home life.\n\nIn his second year of university, he underwent his first surgery and was fitted with \"chunky\" cochlear implants, which he described as feeling like \"putting big globs of chewing gum in your ear.\"\n\nHowever, his bone growth continued in the middle ear \u2014 a rare symptom of otosclerosis \u2014 that ultimately \"killed the cochlear implants\".\n\nNow, he uses hearing aids when necessary, but he often removes them, as he feels they go against his \"natural world\".\n\nHe has devoted his life to breaking down barriers for people with disability and First Nations Australians.\n\nDr Scott's fight for inclusion is inspired by the story of an ancient man, thought to have one leg, whose footprints are preserved in the Lake Mungo area of far west New South Wales.\n\nFight for justice\n\nDr Scott is a professor of Indigenous disability health and wellbeing at the University of Technology Sydney's School of Public Health.\n\nWhen I was approached to write this article about him, I felt both nervous and privileged.\n\nThough I was familiar with his work, the opportunity to speak with him was exciting.\n\nSkye Cusack is a Dulgubarra-Yidinji writer and activist. She lives with physical and mental disabilities. (Supplied: Skye Cusack)\n\nAs I am a Dulgubarra-Yidinji writer and activist living with physical and mental disabilities, I felt an immediate connection with Dr Scott through our shared experiences.\n\nThis common ground naturally guided our conversation, and before long, we were discussing the things we're both passionate about: the fight for justice and excellence.\n\nWe talked about how these causes have shaped our work, and I was curious to hear how Dr Scott had used them to build his own lifetime of advocacy for disability rights.\n\nImportance of being 'pitch perfect'\n\nFrom the beginning of his academic career, Dr Scott understood that true leadership in the disability arena demands excellence.\n\nTo secure a place at the table, he must be nothing less than \"pitch perfect\".\n\nHe likens this challenge to a frog leaping across lily pads, where the frog represents disability leaders, and the lily pads their allies.\n\nDr Scott warns that frogs must be strategic in their leaps, noting that the real challenge lies in \"the patches of bright green lily pads are spaced too far apart, with nothing in between\".\n\nWhen I ask Dr Scott about the overlap of his identities as a First Nations man and someone living with disability, his response is so profound that it gives me pause.\n\nHe points out that while conversations about First Nations people are flourishing, the opposite is happening in the disability sector.\n\n\"Being Indigenous burns your heart, disability freezes you cold,\" he said.\n\nDr Scott say, in a way, he is fortunate that the Indigenous space gives him a platform where he can talk about disability.\n\n\" But even in the Indigenous space, disabilities are a really hard discussion. \"\n\nDr Scott speaking at the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities in New York in 2024. (Supplied: Scott Avery)\n\nDr Scott believes this is because many people are still uncomfortable having the difficult conversations needed to bring real change in the disability sector.\n\nBecause of that, he says, disability leaders end up doing the heavy lifting, which often leads to burnout.\n\nWhat history teaches us about inclusion\n\nAfter experiencing burnout, Dr Scott took time to return to Country, reconnect with his culture, and sit in stillness, removing his hearing aids to be \"ear free\".\n\nWhile reflecting on what really matters, he found himself thinking about inclusion.\n\nHe feels very connected to the Country of Lake Mungo, in far west New South Wales, where the footprints of Indigenous people who lived over 20,000 years ago can be found in the claypans.\n\nFootprints in the Lake Mungo area, NSW are estimated to be about 20,000 years old. (Supplied: Australian Museum)\n\nAmong these are footprints of a man with one leg, evident by the absence of a corresponding footprint.\n\nWhen an archaeologist asked Aboriginal Elders about the footprints, they replied, \"That's a one-legged man on a hunt with his community\".\n\nAfter hearing this story, Dr Scott realised the one-legged man would become a cornerstone in understanding the intersection of disability and the First Nations experience.\n\n\"This idea of 'we take all comers' \u2014 this is what inclusion means to me, and this is how the world [is] meant to be,\" Dr Scott said.\n\nDr Scott describes the moment the one-legged man first communicated with him in a spiritual connection as he sat on Country.\n\n\"It was weird. It was like a conversation,\" he said.\n\nDr Scott says the one-legged man \"gave\" him some tough love, reminding him that the fight for inclusion must continue, even when it's not easy.\n\nThe standard is excellence\n\nDr Scott also balances the intersection of academia and activism.\n\nHe has been very mindful of upholding excellence in all areas because he \"knows the consequences\" of failing to do so \u2014 \"being frozen out or defunded\".\n\nHe believes both disability leaders and allies must exhibit the same calibre of excellence, otherwise \"both the frog and the lily pads will be washed away the next time the heavy rain comes\".\n\nDr Scott presents at a Disability Studies conference at Leeds in the UK. (Supplied: Scott Avery)\n\nHe has often felt that others viewed him as \"broken,\" \"weak,\" and \"self-indulgent,\" even while engaging in conversations about inclusion plans and research projects.\n\n\"If you're going to talk about excellence, you need to do it yourself,\" he said.\n\nDr Scott believes the key to true change lies in partnerships with allies, such as his relationship with the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\nThis collaboration has led to innovative data research that could only happen when people like him are given a seat at the table.\n\n\"Often, I am positioned as a systemic advocate or activist, not an academic. But we have broken that down,\" he said.\n\nDr Scott's book Culture is Inclusion is about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with disability. (ABC News: Katie McAllister)\n\nI read Dr Scott's PhD thesis, titled We Go Hunting Together, before meeting him.\n\nHis research quantifies the experiences of inequality, trauma and discrimination faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living with disability.\n\nReading both the objective data and anecdotal yarning pieces in the thesis felt like looking at myself reflected on a page.\n\nOne participant that Dr Scott interviewed shared a story about a supermarket security guard telling a young man \"You can't come in because you're intoxicated,\" in response to the way his disability presented itself.\n\nDoctor's blamed Skye's disability on her weight Photo shows A young woman with dark hair and and a spotted blouse stands outdoors smiling. Skye Cusack threw herself into weight loss after doctors told her it would likely solve her mobility issues.\n\nAnother participant said resigning from their job because of the lack of support at their workplace \"really affected their mental health,\" and they \"ended up in hospital because of anxiety\".\n\nThese, along with other stories, were experiences that I have lived through as well. The thesis served as an academic mirror of validation.\n\nI share this with him during our conversation, thanking him from the bottom of my heart. He places his hand over his heart and thanks me in return.\n\nThe future of disability leadership\n\nDr Scott believes his work is only the beginning of a long and rewarding fight.\n\nHe sees a future in which emerging leaders \"honour the struggle\" and follow \"the track line set by the disability leaders in the past\" before continuing to make the fight for inclusion their own.\n\n\"The next group will take my work and do a much better job than I did,\" he said.\n\nDr Scott, pictured with Christina Ryan, delivers a speech at the 2024 Disability Leadership Oration in Canberra. (ABC News: Katie McAllister)\n\nDr Scott trusts that the \"Elders and leaders emerging\" will build on his work and add further depth to it.\n\nFill the archives with tales of disability excellence and defiance through the ages and then add your own.\n\nThe future of disability leadership seemed an abstract concept before I spoke with Dr Scott.\n\nNow, I can see it more clearly \u2014 a frog jumping strategically from one lily pad to another.\n\nI am not afraid of the murky water.

    "text": "Australian farmers say the industry is struggling to compete with a flood of cheaper, imported dairy products as production costs remain high and consumers seek out more affordable options.\n\nAbout a quarter of all dairy products consumed in Australia are imported, particularly cheese and butter.\n\nThat is despite Australian dairy farmers producing 387,000 tonnes of cheese alone last financial year.\n\nRabobank senior dairy analyst Michael Harvey said Australia imported many dairy products despite having a large domestic industry.\n\nCost-of-living pressure is driving consumers to opt for discounted products. (ABC Rural: Selina Green)\n\n\"We do see a lot of cheese coming in for manufacturing or for ingredients so quite a lot of cheese from New Zealand and even from the US to service food service channels, sometimes grocery channels,\" Mr Harvey said.\n\nMr Harvey said it had been a long-term trend while Australia's milk supply had declined.\n\n\"But also \u2026 price is important as well,\" he said.\n\n\" When there's a supply gap and it makes economic sense to import product that's affordable, you will do that. \"\n\nThere are more options than ever for Australian dairy consumers on supermarket shelves. (ABC Rural: Selina Green)\n\nIn a statement, a Woolworths spokesperson said the company was committed to supporting Australian farmers.\n\nThey said a majority of Woolworths dairy products were from Australia.\n\n\"We're focused on offering our customers choice and ensuring that country of origin is clearly labelled on all our dairy products to help customers make informed choices,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We believe our current approach balances these considerations while continuing to support Australian dairy producers.\"\n\nA Coles spokesperson said they were proud to have long-standing relationships with more than 100 Australian dairy farmers.\n\n\"The majority of the cheeses we sell at Coles are proudly produced in Australia by our dairy suppliers,\" they said.\n\n\"In fact, more than 80 per cent of our everyday cheese, a staple for many Aussies, sold at Coles is made in Australia from Australian milk.\"\n\n'Huge concern'\n\nAustralian Dairy Products Federation chief executive Janine Waller said the growing volume of imported dairy products was a huge concern for the processing industry.\n\n\"Australians have gradually been eating more and more cheaper imported dairy products, and if I look back over last year, one in four products that were consumed are coming from imported products,\" Ms Waller said.\n\nJanine Waller says consumers are making choices based on price. (Supplied)\n\n\"The challenge is that they're well established.\"\n\nShe said cost-of-living pressure on consumers was a big challenge to overcome.\n\n\"They are tending to go towards the private label, the discounted products and while their best intent is to obviously be buying Australian products, sometimes they can't or they're not able to distinguish between an imported product when it's sitting on shelf in green and gold packaging,\" Ms Waller said.\n\nMs Waller said rising production costs made it hard for Australian products to compete price-wise.\n\n\"The previous three years we've been paying more for raw ingredients for materials than what's happening from an international perspective, and that's obviously invited a flood of cheaper imported dairy products into our supermarket shelves,\" she said.\n\nAustralian dairy output has shrank over the past decade. (ABC News: Olivia Sanders)\n\nMs Waller called on the government to address the issue as a matter of \"food security\".\n\n\"China's had a huge push around how do they make sure that they're self-sufficient as a country \u2026 so we're really looking for our government to do the same thing,\" she said.\n\n\"How do we actually work with the government and farmers and processes side-by-side to really have a strong and vibrant industry?\n\n\"We need to make sure that we've got secure, domestic supply, efficient processing capacity, really creating value in our dairy, and obviously protecting against imports.\"\n\nBen Bennett says imports are affecting dairy production. (Supplied: Australian Dairy Farmers)\n\nAustralian Dairy Farmers president Ben Bennett said domestic dairy production had declined as Australia had shifted to become a net dairy importer.\n\n\"It's completely undermining our supply and demand system within our country,\" Mr Bennett said.\n\n\"Every time it looks like we're about to make a dollar, then they go off and import tens of thousands of tonnes of dairy, so we just get pushed down.\"\n\nToo soon to know tariff impacts\n\nWhile Mr Harvey said any potential tariffs could further shift the international dairy trade, it would likely be to a much lesser extent than for other commodities.\n\n\"We don't see this as significantly disruptive, the way it is at the moment,\" he said.\n\nMichael Harvey says US tariffs would not be felt as keenly in the dairy industry. (Supplied: Rabobank)\n\n\"We actually import quite a bit of dairy from the US into the Australian market, particularly in cheese form, so that's a trade flow coming the other way.\"\n\nWhile considered a major player in the international dairy markets, the United States exports less than New Zealand or the European Union.\n\nAustralia's major export markets are China, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.",

    "text": "Peter Dutton has super-charged his fight against Labor over housing policy with a promise that first time buyers of newly built homes would be able to deduct mortgage payments from income taxes under a Coalition government.\n\nIn what would be a controversial but historic structural change to the nation's tax system, the policy would mean a family on average incomes would be about $11,000 a year better off \u2014 or $55,000 over five years.\n\nAs first revealed by the ABC, the \"first home buyers mortgage deduction scheme\" would be limited to five years and the first $650,000 of a mortgage.\n\nIt would also be means-tested at $175,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples.\n\nMr Dutton announced the policy at the Liberal campaign launch in western Sydney on Sunday, hours before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Perth will showcase Labor's plans to enable first home buyers to enter the market with a 5 per cent deposit, avoiding lenders mortgage insurance.\n\nLabor proposes 5 per cent deposits for all first home buyers Photo shows Anthony Albanese at press conference in Perth electorate of Swan__cc85840b8c1e0e5f247e504610f8094c A re-elected Albanese government would allow all Australians to purchase a first home while avoiding lenders mortgage insurance.\n\n\"Today I bring a message of hope to all Australians seeking to own a home of their own,\" Mr Dutton told the audience of party faithful.\n\n\"I will be a prime minister who restores the dream of home ownership.\"\n\nCoalition housing spokesperson Michael Sukkar told the ABC that the Coalition's housing policy would demonstrate that Labor's offering on housing is a \"lazy Clayton's policy\".\n\nHe said the Coalition, by contrast, would offer \"a massive structural change to our tax system to provide a huge tax concession to encourage first home buyers, to give them the firepower in the first place\".\n\nThe Coalition is expected to insist that its policy would help boost supply of housing by being linked to new construction.\n\n\"In Australia you only get a new house built if someone is prepared to commit,\" he said.\n\n\"The way you unlock supply is encourage someone to pre-commit to a new dwelling.\"\n\nWhile of huge up-front benefit to first home buyers, the Coalition's scheme is likely to receive heavy scrutiny from economists and tax experts.\n\nIn most countries where mortgage interest payments are tax deductible, governments tend to claim a substantial portion of the capital gain of people's homes when they sell.\n\nAnnouncement to set up battle over housing\n\nThe Coalition's plan sets up a direct contest with Labor, which will also spruik its first home buyer centric housing policy at the campaign launch in Perth.\n\nLabor has vowed to allow all first home buyers to purchase a property with a 5 per cent deposit, avoiding the need for lenders' mortgage insurance.\n\nSome 50,000 Australians a year already access the income-capped version of the scheme, but the government expects that number will grow to nearly 80,000 after the expansion.\n\nLabor has vowed to allow all first home buyers to purchase a property with a 5 per cent deposit. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nThe scheme will not have income caps or a limit on the number of places available.\n\nThe government will also pledge $10 billion to go towards building 100,000 properties over eight years exclusively for first home buyers.\n\n\"The housing that is being built today is not affordable for most young people who are entering the market and that's the real problem,\" Housing Minister Clare O'Neil told Insiders.\n\n\"What we are doing is supplementing supply at the affordable end of the market and that's where it is really needed.\n\n\"Our government will roll up its sleeves and get involved, that is the only answer for the housing crisis confronting our country.\"\n\nMs O'Neil said it was too early for her to comment on the Coalition's policy in detail, labelling it \"public policy on the run for a campaign on the slide\".\n\n\"One thing I will say is we have to help young people into home ownership and I'm not sure how this policy is going to assist us to do that,\" she said.\n\n\"The difficulty they are facing is saving a deposit and that is why 5 per cent deposit for first home owners across the country is such a game-changer for young people.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

(ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nGifted the land from his parents, Mr Rayner dreamt of his \"forever home\".\n\n\"We drew up a really big house \u2026 had all the bells and whistles; and then when we went to have it built, we got an appraisal for it and how much it was going to cost,\" he said.\n\n\" And it was just way out of our budget. \"\n\nJosh Rayner shows part of the plan for his DIY home. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nStumbling upon a free online design by Tasmania-based architect Jiri Lev, Mr Rayner decided to take on the build himself.\n\nThere is quite a bit to do! (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nHe downloaded the 120-square-metre three-bedroom blueprint, had Mr Lev revise it for his property, took it to an engineer and sorted approvals.\n\nMr Rayner, a joiner by trade, also has a qualification in carpentry, but hasn't practised.\n\nHe said he was learning as he went, turning to online videos.\n\n\"We have no expectations, we just want to enjoy the process and just not be scared by it,\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully we can build it up, and one day maybe our son, Henry, he might want to take it on.\"\n\nBuilding home 'a natural act for human'\n\nJiri Lev is also guiding people through an Instagram account. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nMr Lev put his design to the test in 2023, when he built his family home in the state's north.\n\nHe said it took about six months and came in at about $150,000 \u2014 including electrical, plumbing, and his labour.\n\nMr Lev, who had no experience building, fitted in construction around part-time work.\n\n\"But it was entirely manageable. It wasn't something that anyone living on a farm is not accustomed to, day in, day out,\" Mr Lev said.\n\nHe said he kept costs down by avoiding imported materials \u2014 turning to what was available locally at hardware stores.\n\nMr Lev has made two plans available, the 'homestead' \u2014 a 3-bedroom, 117sqm countryside home, and the 'cottage' \u2014 a 2-bedroom, 60sqm cottage or secondary dwelling. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nMr Lev advises \"a site plan and structural engineering will all need to be done by an appropriately qualified person, such as any draftsman, building designer or architect\". (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nHe also avoided finishes such as paint, plastic and chemical treatments \u2014 coating required surfaces with natural oils.\n\n\"I try to be economical. Not cheap, but economical,\" he said.\n\nMr Lev said he released his designs to support self-built low-cost housing.\n\n\"The housing crisis doesn't need to be a housing crisis,\" he said.\n\n\"You'll find that it's quite a natural act for a human to build a home.\n\n\"We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, we're trying to remind people what the wheel is.\"\n\nMr Lev said he released his designs to support self-built low-cost housing.

Photo shows a small white modular home Young adults are increasingly drawing on the \"bank of mum and dad\" no matter what their income, researchers have found.\n\nUniversity of Tasmania architectural science laboratory director Mark Dewsbury has also constructed his own home and said there were benefits.\n\n\"As an owner-builder, you generally have a bit more personal concern or care about how the building evolves. Whereas for a builder, it's a business transaction,\" he said.\n\n\" Yes, they want to do a good job, but it's a business transaction. \"\n\nDr Dewsbury said owner-builders could also save \"considerable money\", depending on how much of the work they took on themselves.\n\nBut he said blowing the budget was still a risk and recommended having a financial buffer of 10 to 20 per cent.\n\nDr Dewsbury said homework was crucial, so people knew what to ask design professionals, engineers, surveyors and tradespeople; how to read the building code; and how to plan their timeline.\n\nIndustry warning about structural problems\n\nHousing Industry Association (HIA) Tasmanian executive director Stuart Collins warned against building without experience.\n\nHe said professional builders typically spent four years completing an apprenticeship before obtaining further qualifications and industry experience.\n\n\"Yet, it seems that mums and dads can go and do a two-day workshop,\" he said.\n\n\"And they can pick up a hammer and suddenly be responsible for what is one of the largest investments that people can make.\"\n\nJiri Lev outside a home built to one of his designs. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nMr Collins said builders had established accounts with suppliers and relationships with trades that an inexperienced person would pay a premium on.\n\nAnd he said people could end up turning to builders with a major problem \u2014 from structural integrity to waterproofing.\n\n\"The builder will need to take on the risk, and there's a lot of unknowns,\" he said.\n\nCouple's new home nightmare Photo shows Aerial shot of a house on a coastline.

    "text": "Australian students experience bullying at higher rates than other comparable English-speaking countries, with an estimated one in four reporting they have been regularly bullied.\n\nFollowing the tragic suicide of Sydney year 7 student Charlotte O'Brien last year, the federal government in February announced an \"anti-bullying rapid review\", which will examine current school procedures and inform the development of a national standard to address bullying in schools.\n\nThe review will include consultations with peak organisations from the schools sector, including parent groups, school leaders, and both government and non-government education authorities, as well as directly with parents, teachers and students.\n\nAccording to the Bullying No Way website, students often tell their parents about bullying before teachers.\n\nSo what can parents do if they suspect their child is being bullied?\n\nHow to distinguish typical growing pains from bullying\n\nRachael Murrihy, clinical psychologist and director of The Kidman Centre, offers two metrics to help parents differentiate between normal adolescent struggles and bullying.\n\nThe first metric is the level of distress and whether it's ongoing.\n\n\"So if your daughter comes home and they've been excluded, you would monitor whether it's transient and passes after a day or whether it's ongoing,\" Dr Murrihy told the ABC.\n\nParents often notice behavioural changes that indicate their child is being bullied long before the child can articulate what is happening. (ABC News: Elicia Kennedy)\n\nThe second metric is changes in their daily functioning, such as difficulty eating or sleeping, or noticeable shifts in their mood and confidence.\n\nElizabeth (not her real name), a mother whose child has been bullied, noticed a dip in her child's performance at school because they struggled to focus due to anxiety.\n\nParents of 12-year-old Charlotte O'Brien pay tribute to daughter after reported bullying and suicide Photo shows A pink funeral booklet that has CHARLOTTE O'BRIEN in the title The parents of a 12-year-old girl who took her own life want her story to be shared.\n\n\"They got worried about going to school, and started 'feeling sick' and sleeping poorly,\" Elizabeth said.\n\nDr Murrihy explains that bullying can have academic consequences because it hinders cognitive ability and concentration.\n\n\"The Australian Council for Educational Research found that students with the highest exposure to bullying were shown to be a year behind in their learning compared to their counterparts who had not been bullied,\" Dr Murrihy said.\n\nParents often notice behavioural changes long before the child can even articulate what is happening.\n\n\"Parents know their children the best, so they're in the best place to judge,\" Dr Murrihy said.\n\nThe long-lasting effects of bullying\n\nResearch suggests that the effects of childhood bullying are linked to poor social, health and economic outcomes for up to nearly four decades after exposure.\n\n\"You only have to ask an adult today about their experiences of bullying, and it might be 30 years ago, but they can still tell you about the long-term impacts of nasty words or being attacked by someone,\" Dr Murrihy said.\n\nBullying can have academic consequences because it hinders cognitive ability and concentration. (ABC News: Adam Shirley)\n\nPoor health outcomes include an increased risk of developing mental illnesses like anxiety and depression.\n\n\"If you've been bullied there's an increased risk of developing trauma-like symptoms, so things like emotional numbness, intrusive thoughts, and suicidal thoughts,\" Dr Murrihy said.\n\nAdditionally, bullying can lead to severe trust and self-esteem issues, as those who have been bullied may become overly cautious and withdraw from others.\n\nEncouraging your child to open up\n\nChildren often hesitate to talk about bullying because they fear adults will respond ineffectively and make the situation worse.\n\nWith cyberbullying, for instance, parents may be tempted to \"protect\" their children by simply taking their devices away.\n\nHowever, the eSafety commissioner advises against this, as it may deter the child from discussing future incidents of cyberbullying due to fear of losing their device.\n\nRemoving devices can also make social isolation worse as it cuts them off from supportive friends and online services.\n\nElizabeth recommends checking devices regularly and openly with your child, and generally showing interest in the games and videos they watch online.\n\nIt's important to \"nurture open conversations\" and create that line of communication, she said.\n\nTaking devices away may deter the child from discussing future incidents of cyberbullying. (Adobe Stock)\n\nIf parents have a hunch that something is wrong, Dr Murrihy suggests they should \"not jump in to try and problem solve\" but rather, listen and validate the child's feelings.\n\n\"Give the child as much control as you can with regard to how this is managed,\" she said.\n\n\"Gently explain why it's necessary to tell the school in the cases where it is necessary and listen as to why they might be hesitant.\"\n\nMany children will not want to report the bullying, so it's important to address any concerns they have about the process and reassure them it will be OK.\n\nHow to approach the school\n\nOn top of a child's concerns about reporting bullying to the school, parents often worry about being labelled as \"problem parents\", Dr Murrihy said.\n\nHowever, Elizabeth encourages parents to \"be 'that parent' if your child feels unsafe at school.\"\n\n\"Be confident that your child needs an ally, and nobody in the school knows your child like you do,\" she said.\n\n\" It is not 'causing problems' to speak out \u2026 If you need to speak out, the problem is already there. \"\n\nSchools have a responsibility to provide a safe learning environment free from bullying, and you are well within your rights to report these incidents.\n\nChildren often hesitate to talk about bullying because they fear adults will respond ineffectively and make the situation worse. (Unsplash: Taylor Flowe)\n\nDolly's Dream, an organisation committed to changing the culture of bullying, suggests keeping a detailed record of the bullying incidents, noting dates, places, times and brief descriptions to demonstrate that the problem is ongoing.\n\nAfter the initial report, the school should outline the actions they will take to address the bullying, and you can ask for a progress report.\n\nChallenges parents face when reporting\n\nWhile many bullying issues are resolved at the school level, some parents may encounter resistance when trying to work with the school in good faith.\n\nElizabeth has experienced blame, minimisation, and a lack of accountability in response to reporting the bullying.\n\n\"Some schools have undoubtedly struggled in their handling of bullying incidents, but there is a raft of changes underway,\" Dr Murrihy said.\n\nParents move their kids to new schools as teachers fail to deal with bullies Photo shows Woman wearing a white sundress with brown hair. Choked, punched and stuffed in a rubbish bin: these are some of the bullying incidents kids in NSW schools have experienced.\n\n\"My hope is that schools will be engaging more frequently in these whole school approaches.\"\n\nA whole school approach means that bullying is not just the responsibility of the principal or a few senior teachers but of all staff, students, parents and even the wider community.\n\nStudents are educated about what constitutes bullying and how to respond if they witness it.\n\nTeachers follow clear policies, and have a clear understanding of \"gateway behaviours\" that can escalate into bullying.\n\nAnd parents know how to support their children and recognise potential signs of bullying.\n\nOther measures could include appointing a \"school safety leader\" to champion anti-bullying efforts and creating partnerships with community organisations.\n\nEscalating as a last resort\n\nAlthough it is always better to resolve bullying issues at the school level, if the situation is not addressed, you may choose to escalate the matter.\n\nThe department to contact will depend on what type of school your child goes to.\n\nFor example, public school issues should be escalated to the state's department of education, while Catholic schools typically report to the Catholic Education Office or the governing board.\n\nIf your child is being bullied online, you might decide to report the incident to the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, which can offer advice and help remove harmful online content.",

When I was 15, in the deep Millennial-era Australian suburbs, their single album, Never Mind the Bollocks (1977), represented the promise of punk: social anarchy, relative lack of skill, and branding genius. It\u2019s potent even today, five decades after their flash-in-the-pan heyday. The Sex Pistols perform on stage at Festival Hall on April 5, 2025. Credit: Martin Philbey For this tour, the band is back together for the first time in two decades, this time without former lead singer John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten. He no longer gets on with his bandmates. He\u2019s a vocal Trump supporter now, and he\u2019s described this tour as \u201cpuppetry\u201d and \u201ckaraoke\u201d. The Sex Pistols without John Lydon is a difficult prospect. To me, his unpredictable screech is what defined the band. It\u2019s INXS without Michael Hutchence, or Queen without Freddie Mercury. He\u2019d hate both comparisons, but he\u2019s not here to protest.\n\nTonight, the position is filled by Frank Carter, erstwhile singer from Gallows and the Rattlesnakes. In front of an image of two huge speakers marked \u201cNOWHERE\u201d and \u201cBOREDOM\u201d, the band members, aged in their late 60s \u2013 apart from Carter, 40 \u2013 lead us into a rousing Holidays in the Sun, followed by Seventeen. \u201cI\u2019m so lazy,\u201d Carter sings, not lazily. His voice is more Billie Joe Armstrong than Johnny Rotten, tight-wound and cover-band-accurate to the source material. But is accuracy what we want from a band who promised to rip up rock and roll and rebuild it? By Pretty Vacant, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s here to compere the old guard and foster a singalong. \u201cThe old boys deserve it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey f---in\u2019 invented this shit.\u201d They can\u2019t declare themselves \u201cthe greatest punk band in history\u201d, but he can. \u201cI\u2019m not an animal,\u201d they shout in Bodies, confined to their stage mics, while Carter is in the audience, crowd-surfing. The Sex Pistols have reunited for the first time in two decades. Credit: Martin Philbey The rest of the set, comprised mostly of tracks from their one album, passes without error, and I won\u2019t lie: I sing along, at times screaming. It\u2019s infectious, cathartic. In the encore, Carter leads us in a rendition of My Way, in tribute to the other absent Pistol, Sid Vicious, who allegedly killed his girlfriend Nancy Spungen, before dying of an overdose on bail. The band\u2019s manager sold T-shirts marking her death. They\u2019ve always been a branding exercise. After the show, most fans I ask are thrilled with the results. The pub around the corner from Festival Hall, the Angry Dog, is full of Sex Pistols fans, and the absence of Lydon is a win. Gail, from Glasgow, Scotland via Perth, WA, describes Lydon as \u201ca right-wing English prick.\u201d I overhear someone else describing Carter as a \u201cwanker\u201d. Better a wanker than a prick.\n\nReviewed by Will Cox\n\nDANCE\n\nShadow Text \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until April 12 Back from Brussels, where she is now based, choreographer Chloe Chignell returns with an enigmatic, bookish new contemporary dance work \u2013 co-created with Amina Szecs\u00f6dy \u2013 steeped in continental culture and sophistication. Shadow Text is a response to Monique Wittig\u2019s 1969 novel-length prose poem Les Gu\u00e9rill\u00e8res Credit: Rudy Carlier This is a welcome return, even if the show \u2013 a response to Monique Wittig\u2019s 1969 novel-length prose poem Les Gu\u00e9rill\u00e8res \u2013 is a little left field, a little opaque in its construction. Wittig\u2019s book, a cult classic, describes a radically feminist state at war with men. It has a splintered, incantatory style that gives it a dreamlike, almost mythic power. Chignell has an ongoing fascination with the relationship between writing and dancing, and here she responds as much to the book\u2019s eerie moonlit atmosphere as its story of epic conflict.\n\nThe two dancers \u2013 Chignell and Szecs\u00f6dy \u2013 begin with a simple, springy stepdance, which soon transforms into a slow, concentrated crawl as they circle the space, creating images of deliquesce and deformation. Some of this vocabulary echoes scenes from Wittig\u2019s novel \u2013 women riding into battle, swinging deadly bolos \u2013 but mostly it tries to body forth the book\u2019s queer, cloistered erotic intensity. Loading Wittig was a novelist but also a theorist, aligned with the mid-century French intellectual tradition that privileged text over speech, language over the body \u2013 where revolution begins with words. One aim of this project is to revisit and challenge these ideas, treating them \u2013 perhaps deliberately \u2013 as if they still hold more currency than they do. Hence the prominence of projected and spoken text in this show. Some of this is original and some of it is a revision of Les Gu\u00e9rill\u00e8res. The juxtapositions, however, between text and movement don\u2019t always create a strong impression, as if the shadow of the work\u2019s title is what lies between them. It\u2019s an intriguing performance, but I wish there was more contextual framing, because Shadow Text feels like a fragment of a larger and more urgent conversation unfolding elsewhere, just beyond our hearing.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nDANCE\n\nSpringCity 43214 \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until April 12 Interactive dance \u2013 where the audience helps steer what\u2019s performed \u2013 is an old idea that rarely gets a run outside the improv and comedy circuit. The last example I saw was Joel Bray\u2019s comic lecture staged in a suburban pub years ago. So, producer-performer MaggZ really is breaking new ground with this attempt at combining audience participation with higher-than-normal production values. Producer-performer MaggZ really is breaking new ground with SpringCity 43214. Credit: Simon L. Wong This is a serious attempt to integrate the audience without compromising on spectacle. Created by and for \u2013 as the show\u2019s website notes \u2013 the Asian diasporic community, the production borrows its aesthetic from arcade culture, transporting us to SpringCity 43214: a virtual, neon-noir, pan-Asian fantasia, with a backdrop of colourful animated patterns and a soundtrack ranging from ambient electronica to kitschy techno. Despite its game-like trimmings \u2013 character selection, a computerised voice-over \u2013 this isn\u2019t really a game. There\u2019s no contest, no quest, no real goal. The interactivity is more old-school. In the first round, for example, a performer with a microphone approaches audience members and offers them a selection of cards. They choose one, and a new style or task is announced. The dancers adjust accordingly.\n\nThe central character is played by MaggZ herself, with supporting roles performed by hitahhchi and Aqua. Early sections are deliberately slow, built around stylised group poses. It\u2019s not until the third sequence \u2013 which spills partly into the audience \u2013 that momentum builds, showcasing sharper street dance stylings. MaggZ, in particular, impresses with precision, speed and snap. The production is technically ambitious, syncing live interactions with shifting sound and light. But with only two performances, there\u2019s little time to bed things in. On opening night, the sound was a little too loud, and the lighting a little too dark, which meant the participatory elements felt confused. This is a show you\u2019d learn a lot from over time, but not, I think, in just two performances.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann MUSIC\n\nCyndi Lauper: The Farewell Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nRod Laver Arena, April 2 Cyndi Lauper walks on stage to an explosion of rainbow confetti and dives straight into She Bop, an ode to masturbation. She\u2019s 71 years old, 160 centimetres tall, and exuberant as hell in blue-green hair, blasting through a recorder solo before chucking the instrument offstage. Cyndi Lauper performs at Rod Laver Arena, April 2, 2025. Credit: Martin Philbey\n\nThe crowd are in tulle skirts, glitter and colourful wigs, which are on sale in the foyer \u2013 the money goes to her charity, Girls Just Wanna Have Fundamental Rights. Tonight is supposedly part of Lauper\u2019s farewell tour, and she\u2019s going out on top. She still has a voice like a box of crayons, bright, messy, and expressive. She uses everything, with soaring vibrato, sometimes audibly out of breath, imprecise and alive. The set is \u201980s-heavy, leaning most on her \u201983 debut She\u2019s So Unusual, with some middle-of-the-road \u201990s stuff and, to my delight, the song she did for The Goonies thrown in. Tonight is supposedly part of Lauper\u2019s farewell tour, and she\u2019s going out on top. Credit: Martin Philbey It\u2019s a talky night. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a bang-bang show,\u201d she says unapologetically in her irresistible Brooklyn drawl (\u201cIt\u2019s a paww-deee!\u201d). She tells us about family, the cousin who had a pigeon coop on her roof, the women who raised her and the way they\u2019d cut up old clothes and make something brand new with them. She does the same with her art, of course. Many of her songs are written by others but she makes them utterly her own. She tells us she recorded I Drove All Night, written for Roy Orbison, because there were no songs on the radio about women driving. \u201cWhen you get in the car and you can drive anywhere you freakin\u2019 want, that\u2019s a power song.\u201d\n\nShe cycles through about half-a-dozen costume changes, each with a different hair colour: sparkly, shoulder-padded jackets, asymmetrical suits, underwear on the outside, a floor-length Norma Desmond number, a red jacket with a bright yellow wig. \u201cI tried to dress up faw ya,\u201d she says. As this outfit\u2019s designer Christian Siriano told her: \u201cThe gays want glamour.\u201d Loading For the evergreen Time After Time, Melbourne\u2019s Tones and I joins for a duet that\u2019s like every wedding dance floor you\u2019ve ever been on: messy and beautiful. And she delivers True Colours flawlessly, standing on a small satellite stage in the middle of the arena with a long rainbow scarf metres in the air. For the finale, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, she\u2019s joined by The Veronicas, who sink into the background in a stage designed in polka-dot tribute to artist Yayoi Kusama. Even this, her signature tune, is a cover of a late-\u201970s pop-punk number, sung by a man, but I defy you to listen to that original and think of it as anything less than a sketch for Lauper to colour in and make something wonderful, defiant and punch-the-air fun.\n\nReviewed by Will Cox\n\nJAZZ\n\nMatthew Ottignon\u2019s Volant \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Jazzlab, April 4 Matthew Ottignon\u2019s latest album was conceived during a period of unusual calm for the composer-saxophonist. Back in Sydney after years of touring and performing in other people\u2019s bands, Ottignon finally found time to let his own creativity take flight. That idea of flight \u2013 and the freedom it embodies \u2013 resonates throughout the album, aptly titled Volant. Composer and saxophonist Matthew Ottignon. Credit: Greg Sheehan His current quartet has now adopted Volant as a band name, and it\u2019s the perfect moniker for an outfit that can glide and soar as naturally as a flock of birds. One of the tunes they played at Jazzlab on Friday night (Murmuring) was inspired by the flight of starlings, moving through the sky like an undulating cloud and capable of sudden, instinctive changes of direction. Swift, beating pulsations from Lauren Tsamouras\u2019 piano, Hannah James\u2019 bass and Hayley Chan\u2019s drums created a sense of propulsion and uplift as Ottignon\u2019s sax hovered, then ascended over a fast-moving landscape. Rolling and Circling exuded a similar energy, though with a more open, expansive feel. Ottignon\u2019s full-bodied tenor swept in circles over the rhythm section\u2019s turbulent sea, surging with soulful intensity before the waves unexpectedly settled and the sea grew calm.\n\nLoading Other tunes demonstrated the group\u2019s ability to evoke atmosphere through subtlety and nuance. Circular Breathing opened with a whisper of brushes on cymbals, arco bass and ghostly overtones from Ottignon\u2019s sax; Naturis conjured an air of mystery via brooding chord changes and an unhurried, rolling sway. But this is a band that also knows how to groove \u2013 even over odd meters and fitful rhythms. Rocky Lux saw the ensemble strutting breezily in a Latin-tinged 7/4; Bilpin set up an exuberant canter that bubbled with vitality; and on the final tune (Jetsetters), the quartet hopscotched nimbly across a stop-start pulse with playful precision, their visible delight radiating outwards and becoming an invisible current on which we, too, could take flight.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas DANCE\n\nPoesis and The Bastard \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until April 5 The latest Dancehouse double bill features two works that differ wildly in their commitments to technique and virtuosity, but which together make for an invigorating and provoking evening of dance theatre.\n\nGabriella Imrichova\u2019s cheekily titled The Bastard aims to challenge expectations with a surprising blend of theatre, performance art and only little dance. It\u2019s a bit punk and a bit mongrel, but consistently funny. Loading This is a performance in two halves. First, we get a dry parody of non-dance, a somewhat dated form of experimental dance in which movement is withheld: it\u2019s slow and repetitious and very low effort. Either side of this performance, Imrichova addresses the audience, simulating apprehension about its reception: about whether it fits the context and whether it works as dance. It\u2019s mischievous but not without charm. Then follows a wild rant about art and novelty. There were a few walkouts on opening night, but that\u2019s surely a victory for an artist who declares that trolling is a creative practice.\n\nPrue Lang\u2019s Poesis sits more securely within the conventions of contemporary dance. It\u2019s a duet in which the two dancers generate striking compositions from subtle contrasts in form, line and intention. Both performers are extraordinary. Benjamin Hancock, with his strange elongations, projects a kind of alien grace. And Tara Jade Samaya \u2013 returning to Melbourne after a long absence \u2013 is all strength and control. Poesis moves through various phases, the dancers arranging themselves in ways that are unexpected but visually satisfying, mixing traditions and vocabularies, folding themselves together and even improvising with a game of follow the leader. The costumes exaggerate the effects of counterpoint in interesting ways. Samaya appears in boxing gear while Hancock is in pointe shoes: there are luridly patterned unitards, absurd heels, lots of activewear and some deluxe furry boots. It\u2019s a little cerebral but nonetheless attractive. Imrichova has the freshness of a new voice, but Lang brings the more serious engagement with contemporary dance and its possibilities.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann",

Third time\u2019s a charm for Rosie Jones and Melbourne. The comedian returns with her third solo show, I Can\u2019t Tell What She\u2019s Saying, opening with a declaration of love for our city. After all, we share what Jones dubs \u201cthe Shakira approach\u201d to alcohol: whenever, wherever. Melbourne audiences adore her in return. In previous MICF shows, Jones declared that she was waiting for David Attenborough or his ilk to die so she could take on the coveted mantle of national treasure. Well, she\u2019s done waiting, this time gleefully declaring herself a national treasure multiple times. Frankly, it\u2019s hard to argue. From tales of meeting royals to single life and her dual passions (gravy and tits, natch), it\u2019s all first class. Fans of her takes on queer and disabled life will find plenty here too. She\u2019s cheekier, ruder, swearier, brasher and funnier than ever. Her audience croons with laughter; the love affair between city and comedian is clearly not one-sided.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nDavid Quirk | The House That Was Never Built\n\nCoopers Inn, until April 20 I\u2019ve attended every show by David Quirk since his 2013 exploration of his own infidelity, Shaking Hands with Danger. Twelve years later, I\u2019m still convinced that when he brings his A-game that he\u2019s the best storyteller in Australian comedy, even if his crowd sizes and venues suggest otherwise. David Quirk will perform The House That Was Never Built at Coopers Inn until April 20. Quirk acknowledges this. \u201cThis is one of the rare pubs in the central business district that retains a general soullessness,\u201d he laments, as he performs in a room above a sports bar where a level below most are betting on greyhounds. The House That Was Never Built centres on the inheritance of a small bit of land following the passing of both his parents, and his partner\u2019s encouragement for him to build a home. Quirk is no headspace to think about entering the housing market. He\u2019s barely making ends meet as a comedian and with a side hustle of painting other people\u2019s houses. To save money, he once moved from St Kilda to Fitzroy on the 96 tram.\n\nBut still, he persisted, and the hour follows his conversations with a draughtsman named Beau \u2013 a chain-smoking alcoholic whose flurries of trains-of-thought range from poetic, profound, but mostly profane. But Quirk finds a rare humanity in the discourse \u2013 and mines it for introspection on the human condition and privileges in life. It\u2019s a marvel to see this level of talent in such an intimate setting.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Tyson Wray Brendan Murphy | Buffy Revamped\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until April 20 Wearing a black tee, skinny jeans and Dr. Martens boots, a wiry, demonic gentleman with slicked-back, bleached blond hair and varnished black nails graces the stage. \u201cYou all Buffy fans, are ya?\u201d he inquires menacingly. It\u2019s none other than Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019s one-time paramour, Spike, played with campy flair by British comedian Brendan Murphy. Brendan Murphy\u2019s Buffy Revamped is at fortyfivedownstairs until April 20. Murphy\u2019s satirical one-man send up of the seven-season supernatural series is a hilarious trip down a \u201990s pop culture vortex, accompanied by a nostalgic soundtrack. The production perfectly encapsulates the Sunnydale essentials with moody lighting, smoke effects, a bookshelf, and a high school locker. The pointy stakes are aimed high, but Murphy\u2019s theatrical prowess is primed to absolutely kill it. From physical to musical comedy, accents to wigs, he playfully captures the characters and storylines while lightly mocking narrative holes and the unrealistic context (how did club Bronze survive on the patronage of minors?). In moments when the sold-out crowd doesn\u2019t respond as expected, Murphy\u2019s ad-libbed retorts still generate a laugh. Catch it before the hellmouth swallows Melbourne whole.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nNicole Gulasekharam | Casual Receptionist of the Quarter\n\nThe Motley Bauhaus \u2013 Cabaret Room, until April 20 \u201cI find as long as I am calm and non-threatening, and articulate, charismatic, submissive, present, resilient, likeable, agreeable, and mindful of something, it\u2019s usually fine,\u201d the titular receptionist, played by Nicole Gulasekharam, says about one-third of the way into this one-woman show. Nicole Gulasekharam is the Casual Receptionist of the Quarter at The Motley Bauhaus. And this is how Casual Receptionist of the Quarter goes: Gulasekharam greets customers and tries to resolve complaints behind a makeshift gym reception desk, all while rolling fresh towels and making occasional announcements into the loudspeaker to inform all gym-goers to please wipe down their equipment before leaving. This is workplace comedy at its best. In between scenes at the gym, we learn that the protagonist is a struggling 24-year-old musician who has had to move back in with her parents to cut down on expenses. At one point, when a customer compliments her on having lost weight, she blurts out: \u201cI\u2019ve not been able to afford food.\u201d\n\nThere is a particular Peep Show feel to Casual Receptionist, with obvious nods to other satirical shows such as Parks & Recreation and Utopia. Loading We witness Gulaksekharam\u2019s activities and gaffes up-close as she interacts with a myriad of invisible people off-stage. Her acting is a delight to witness: she shifts from mirth to disappointment through minute facial expressions and small movements that reveal a latent helplessness and angst. Her comedic timing, too, is incredible. As the show builds up, multimedia and musical elements come together for Gulasekharam to showcase her multiple talents, a true joy to watch. If art is about reflecting the times, Gulasekharam\u2019s show has it all: interrogations about labour and its expectations in this world, delivered in a way that\u2019s engaging, well-paced and non-didactic. The fact that Gulasekharam does indeed have a decade of experience working as a gym receptionist is the icing on the cake \u2013 autofiction, but done live.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Cher Tan\n\nVidya Rajan and Mel McGlensey | Greg\n\nChinese Museum, until April 20 In a festival of nearly 700 shows, it\u2019s fair to assume more than a few of the Gregs in this audience bought their tickets based on the show title alone. There are at least three on this night \u2013 which is exactly what Rajan and McGlensey want. Vidya Rajan (left) and Mel McGlensey idolise Greg at Chinese Museum. The whole pretext of the show is that Gregs are superior humans to be idolised and celebrated. They proceed to list all the laudable qualities in a Greg, and have created a catchy-cute theme song around it. Said Gregs are invited to the stage to either participate or watch from the premium seats to the side of the stage. It\u2019s all delightfully silly and brave and weird. The pair presents as deliberately amateurish but with flashes of brilliance \u2013 like when they face off in a rap battle (purposely misheard as a \u201crat\u201d battle), and Rajan launches into an impressive performance punctuated with the funniest gag of the night.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nHunter Smith | Bushranger\n\nTasma Terrace, until April 20 When Hunter Smith got an alarming text from a former \u201cf--- bestie\u201d, he embarked on a journey that eventually revealed he was a descendant of one of Australia\u2019s most iconic outlaws. He tried not to make it his whole personality \u2014 but failed. Hunter Smith performs Bushranger at Tasma Terrace until April 20. In line with the title, there\u2019s a real Australiana feel to the show. Smith discusses his aversion to the bush and drops cultural references from across the eras, from Harold Holt to Belle Gibson and The Veronicas. He proposes we retaliate against Trump by putting a tariff on Bluey and Nicole Kidman, our two biggest exports to America. The writing is sharp \u2013 unsurprising, given Smith was formerly the head writer on The Project. His casual affability makes you feel like you\u2019re gossiping with a friend, with intrusive thoughts thrown in as ad lib. His Joel Creasey impersonation \u2013 bang on. The room within the Victorian terrace venue is eerily dark, with only fluorescent blue lighting illuminating the room. Whether by design or accident, it adds to the colonial narrative being woven. A how-to on tracing your roots and embracing the unexpected revelations that result.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nSchalk Bezuidenhout | Crowd Pleaser\n\nThe Greek Centre, until April 20 South African comic Schalk Bezuidenhout is a rock star of a performer. So much that he even crowdsurfs over the sold-out audience to the music of Kelly Clarkson. Schalk Bezuidenhout is a Crowd Pleaser at The Greek Centre. On his third visit to Melbourne, Bezuidenhout bursts out of the gates with recollections of his homeland \u2013 be it the stereotypes of crime-riddled neighbourhoods and tales of being carjacked, or how through comedy (Trevor Noah\u2019s stint hosting The Daily Show) and politics (Elon Musk in the White House), South Africa is slowly taking over the world. He delivers one of the finest (and loudest) routines of the festival when speaking about the house he bought in the coastal town of Ballito, a gesture he made to please his wife who would then go on to leave him \u2013 now a dwelling that represents more of a zoo than a home. He even invites a member of the audience to take the mic and deliver any joke of their pleasing. It\u2019s a daring/dangerous move in any environment, but culminates with one of the best callbacks I\u2019ve ever seen at this festival. Crowd Pleaser is a scorching hour of rapid-fire gags and manic energy. Highly recommended.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\n\nThe 35th Annual Great Debate\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, April 12 It\u2019s a testament to the pulling power of the comedy festival\u2019s highly vaunted annual debate that audiences chose to congregate in a majestic dark room instead of enjoying the unseasonably warm day. Desiree Burch argued on the negative team for this year\u2019s Great Debate. The two teams this year squared off against each other to argue for and against the statement \u201cthat social media is good, actually\u201d, which would seem like a somewhat tired premise if it weren\u2019t for the renewed actions of tech oligarchs and Australia\u2019s recently implemented social media ban for children. Hosted by the effervescent Steph Tisdell, whose periodic bouts of wheezing laughter begot a similar response from the crowd, Pierre Novellie (affirmative captain), Jenny Tian and Chris Parker faced off against Alexei Toliopoulos (negative captain), Gillian Cosgriff and Desiree Burch.\n\nNovellie kicked things off strongly by detailing the merits of each social media platform and playing footage of the state of the world before its advent \u2013 taking the debate to a laughably dark place. In what would become an overarching theme of his contributions, Toliopoulos went deep and niche as a certified film guy on the \u201ccinephile registry\u201d, outlining all the ways social media had ruined film-watching and filmmaking. There could be no better proponent for social media than Tian, a viral TikTok sensation whose online popularity has translated into a flourishing stand-up career. She was the first to go combative and personal with customised jabs aimed at each member of the negative team, drawing howls of laughter from an audience fanging for blood. Cosgriff did what she does best and sang about the corrosive effect social media has had on her attention span and ability to get things done. Loading Parker evoked the power of community that social media brought him as a gay closeted teen. The positive team drew on an arsenal of supporters \u2013 conservationists in Tian\u2019s case, firefighters in Parker\u2019s \u2013 to further underline the revolutionary power of social media. As perhaps the only Gen Xer in either team, Burch brought things home with a passionate manifesto that had more soundbites than one could count. Channelling an ominous Marvel villain in his pointed rebuttal, Novellie expertly denounced each of the three negative debaters\u2019 points, but Toliopoulos countered that by running headfirst into the continuation of an utterly mad and lengthy anecdote about minions, pronounced mignon (you had to be there). Despite the lack of effective rebuttal from the negative team, they won \u2013 though as Parker pointed out, it wouldn\u2019t stop anyone from doom-scrolling once they got home.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nChloe Petts | How You See Me, How You Don\u2019t\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 20 Petts is riding the waves of success on the main stage, with spots on this festival\u2019s gala and, back home in England, a Saturday morning TV sports show. Which is how the self-described \u201cradical feminist queer\u201d (who also happens to be a \u201cfootball lad\u201d) wound up with her first lot of social media trolls. Chloe Petts performs How You See Me, How You Don\u2019t at Melbourne Town Hall. In previous shows, Petts has used her apparent juxtapositions in identity to disarm and dismantle prejudices against the queer community. This hour is more personal. We go back to her school days in Kent and imagine a young Petts in context: school captain, oblivious to her own sexuality and impervious to bullying. This becomes unexpectedly meta on Saturday night as an inebriated second row threatens to derail the show, and one audience member suggests they could leave. Petts is quick to defuse with her brilliant and ever-agile crowd work, and we witness what she\u2019s already told us: be it hecklers or trolls, she needs no one to protect her.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nSofie Hagen | Banglord\n\nThe Greek \u2013 Gallery, until April 20 There\u2019s no time to be wasted on needless introductions and crowd work in Danish comedian and podcaster Sofie Hagen\u2019s show. A natural raconteur with a gentle air of self-deprecation, Hagen immediately disarms audiences with a joke about her smartwatch before launching into a memorable hour of humorous soliloquies. Sofie Hagen performs Banglord at The Greek until April 20. The throughline of Banglord is the fact that Hagen hasn\u2019t had sex in a very long time. She decides to meet with a sexologist, who turns out to be someone quite different to who she envisioned. Hagen oscillates between recounting this story and meandering into entertaining tangents about being a queer, non-binary, fat person. When presented with a close friend\u2019s admission that she\u2019s bisexual, Hagen weaves an extended hypothetical about living with a wife that becomes more uproarious the longer she persists with it. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to refer to me by \u2018they\u2019 and be proud of themselves,\u201d she says in a bit admonishing those who feel a disproportionate sense of pride in getting people\u2019s pronouns right while elucidating her own. Countering the fatphobia that remains prevalent in comedy, Hagen takes aim at people who insist she\u2019s \u201cnot fat\u201d but beautiful, skinny people, chairs ill-equipped to accommodate bigger bodies. It\u2019s refreshing to be in a room erupting in laughter at a person punching up towards the institutions that belittle them when the opposite is still far too common.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nRhys Darby | The Legend Returns\n\nThe Athanaeum, until April 13 From robots to rocketships and Rubik\u2019s cubes, this slick hour of comedy bursts at the seams with the accoutrements of humanity\u2019s aspirations. We created them, we don\u2019t understand them and, Darby suggests, we likely can\u2019t control them \u2013 the AI horse has already bolted. Rhys Darby is The Legend Returns at The Athenaeum. For many comedians, an observation would stop there but Darby goes the extra step every time, physically committing to each bit and character \u2013 even as the metaphors grow extra metaphors, like AI horses with too many limbs. A line about saying things you shouldn\u2019t turns into an elaborate escapade where his thoughts boldly venture from the brain to the vocal cords. We revisit the \u2018hoverboards\u2019 of last decade and explore what school drop-off might look like using drones. Some of these are amusing sidebars while others loop back as clever set-ups in a wildly imaginative sci-fi-comedy narrative. The Tesla Cybertruck and dancing Roomba vacuum cleaner impressions are gold.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nAhir Shah | Ends\n\nThe Westin \u2013 One, until April 20 British-Indian comic Ahir Shah isn\u2019t your average stand-up. His routines characteristically wade into dark and difficult material \u2013 mental health and mortality in Duffer, the rise of authoritarianism in Control \u2013 but there\u2019s a tinge of something different this time. Shah has found love and refuses to be anything other than \u201cstaggeringly na\u00efve\u201d, even as the UK devolves into a place \u201ccalling its last drinks\u201d. Ahir Shah performs Ends at The Westin until April 20. Speaking at a frenetic pace, spurting out more words in a minute than most people are capable of in 10, Shah warms the audience up with punchlines about his name, learning Latin, and arranged marriages. It\u2019s but a mere prelude to his central preoccupation: the privilege to \u201cgo without saying\u201d as a person of colour in the UK, which Rishi Sunak\u2019s appointment as prime minister heralded, and the generational progress that\u2019s unfolded since Shah\u2019s n\u0101n\u0101j\u012b migrated to London in 1964. The laughs evaporate as Shah moves into the emotional terrain of unacknowledged sacrifice, the dislocation of migration and the sheer dehumanisation of racism. But he\u2019s a consummate performer, always holding the tension of the room in the palm of his hand as he oscillates between passionate raving orations and punchlines designed to dispel the pressure cooker atmosphere of the room. Whether you believe or not in the merits of representation politics, Shah poetically and resoundingly argues that 2025 would\u2019ve appeared positively utopian to his n\u0101n\u0101j\u012b. If you\u2019re closer to tears than you thought you\u2019d be, it\u2019s proof of Shah\u2019s skilled extrapolation between the personal and the political.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nOlga Koch | Came From Money\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 20 A show that centres on your own affluence, at a festival where many performers are destined to incur a financial loss, in the time of a cost-of-living crisis? It\u2019s a bold move \u2013 but Olga Koch circumnavigates the awkwardness of checking her own privilege ingeniously. Olga Koch Came From Money plays at Melbourne Town Hall until April 20. The Russian-born comic was born into unfathomable wealth due to her father \u2013 the once-deputy prime minister of Boris Yeltsin \u2013 who was a benefactor from when the riches during the collapse of the Soviet Union were divided. A wealth not one that Koch took for granted, but politely declined to receive furthermore from her family in her early 20s. Came From Money is a piercing skewer of capitalism, socialism, oligarchies, class divides, and how we are defined by our bank balances. Koch\u2019s ability to heel-turn from economic inequality into societal critiques and observations is superb, be it a borderline disgusting comparison of the fall of the Berlin Wall to the female reproductive system, call-backs, or impeccable crowd work. She ends with a line I\u2019m sure her promoters must hate: \u201cIf you know someone who wants to see the show but can\u2019t afford it, just get them to message me \u2013 I don\u2019t want someone not to be able to see a show about money because of money.\u201d It\u2019s an ode to the ideology that money should never be a barrier to life in a perfect world \u2013 or at least a damn good comedy show.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\n\nNish Kumar | Nish, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe\n\nArts Centre Melbourne, until April 20 British comedian Nish Kumar barely utters a breath as he delivers his politically imbued, rage-fuelled set at pace. He argues that Rishi Sunak and Usha Vance don\u2019t represent his ideals despite their shared Indian heritage. Nish Kumar in Nish, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe, at Arts Centre Melbourne. There\u2019s a false start as his walk-on music plays prematurely: an altered version of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Bitch, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe, which inspired the show\u2019s name. He sheepishly confesses he was busy eating an orange and using the bathroom at the time. The pre-election timing of Kumar\u2019s show is fortuitous. The first half draws humorous comparisons between UK, US and Australian politicians and their policies, encouraging the audience to use their upcoming vote wisely. The second half is a notable shift towards personal observations, revealing his battles with anxiety and its origins. The intended 70-minute set runs for just under two hours. He promises to rectify this for future shows, graciously creating an opportunity for audiences to exit if need be. An intelligent jokester with a moral vendetta.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nCon Coutis | Escape from Heck Island\n\nMalthouse \u2013 Playbox, until April 20 Armed with an impish grin and decked out in a boilersuit, Con Coutis is the \u201ccorrectional system\u2019s favourite comedian\u201d. But what happens when a case of mistaken identity results in Coutis becoming a prisoner himself? Con Coutis tries to Escape from Heck Island at The Malthouse. With over an hour of immaculately incorporated pre-recorded audiovisual cues, audiences are plunged into the immersive world of Heck Island where different cliques rule the roost and a certain iteration of MasterChef holds the key to Coutis\u2019 escape. Incarcerated alongside Coutis, the audience \u2013 and therefore audience participation, albeit of the most unthreatening kind \u2013 is a big part of the show. It\u2019s testament to Coutis\u2019 easy affability that not even an unco-operative audience member in the front row throws him off. Escape from Heck Island is a clever show that seamlessly melds multimedia components with live interactions \u2013 culminating in something that feels dynamic, vibrant and open to the vagaries of possibility. There\u2019s a healthy dose of misdirection in the way Coutis constantly subverts expectations while obscuring his working. Simultaneously interrogating the social contract between audience and comedian while acting in an ensemble cast where he\u2019s the only onstage performer, Coutis has assembled an exceedingly well-crafted hour of throwbacks, cultural references and suspended disbelief.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nPaul Foot | Dissolve\n\nArts Centre Melbourne, until April 20 With his feral pixie coiffure and signature pigeon strut, Paul Foot has always cultivated an air of pompous buffoonery. He\u2019s a clever guy, but also a ridiculous Englishman yelling absurdities, and retains a clownish aspect even when getting serious. Which, surprisingly, he does this year. Paul Foot performs Dissolve at Arts Centre Melbourne until April 20. Fans will be treated to some of the familiar absurdities \u2013 ancient Egyptian teen dramas, pop singers on the battlefield \u2013 but they\u2019ll also learn about his decades-long struggle with depression, the childhood trauma behind it and the three seconds in which it was resolved. It\u2019s a shock to anyone expecting his usual semi-surreal rants, but the way Foot treads so lightly around these hard issues is truly enigmatic. He\u2019s built a show around crippling emotional wounds that just ... got better? There\u2019s power in the way he refuses to turn his inner life into a vehicle for audience catharsis, but taking us to challenging places and then turning out the lights is a courageous yet bizarre comic choice.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by John Bailey\n\nAlex Hines | Girl Culture\n\nThe Malthouse \u2013 The Tower, until April 20 If you didn\u2019t have an entire audience yelling out \u201cOne Nation\u201d on your comedy festival bingo card, you may not be familiar with the work of absurdist sketch comedian Alex Hines. Alex Hines\u2019 Girl Culture is on at The Malthouse until April 20. The infamous Pauline Hanson features three times in Hines\u2019 introductory song for Girl Culture, each time funnier than the last. Her lyrics run the gamut from explaining what girl culture is \u2013 from hair extensions to neurodivergence to womanly excretions \u2013 and highlighting both the pervasiveness and inanity underpinning girlhood\u2019s latest resurgence in pop culture. Girl Culture is an hour of disparate fantastical sketches that have either tenuous or no connections to the central conceit. Aided by slides, Hines is a versatile performer who does superb character work \u2013 she can switch seamlessly between pathos and levity, inhabit different personas at the drop of a (literal) hat, and assume distinctive accents with aplomb. There are many costume and wig changes, and even more shifts in tone and subject matter, which can be discombobulating. Some sketches are stronger than others. Highlights include a soft-drink competition where Hines is a Diet Coke songstress, and a surreal sequence where Hines becomes her great-aunt, a Midwestern woman who lost her head in a hurricane. You\u2019ll never know what\u2019s coming next, but strap yourselves in for a rollercoaster ride around the recesses of Hines\u2019 mind.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nAnna Dooley | Endhoe\n\nQueen Victoria Women\u2019s Centre, until April 19 Endo\u2019s no joke. Frequently listed as one of the 20 most painful diseases of the human body, tonight she is personified by comedian and actor Anna Dooley. Endo takes centre stage after being promoted to CEO of Dooley\u2019s nervous system. She\u2019s a powerful CEO giving a rousing presentation to the other organs and nerves of Dooley\u2019s body. Anna Dooley performs Endhoe at The Malthouse until April 20. Facing down a variety of foes from home-brand f-boys to painkillers and doctors, she\u2019s running the show right here in front of us. Tales of hijacking her host-body\u2019s attempts to work, socialise or otherwise live life connect with the audience, eliciting knowing laughter and groans of familiarity. Highlights included a vigorous pain-scale workout/dance routine as Endo works on her crescendo of pain rising from one up to 10. Dooley has taken a sadly common experience that isn\u2019t acknowledged enough in medicine or society and found a way to make it funny: no joke.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nKevin Han | Extremely Tall and Incredibly Chinese\n\nStoryville, until April 20 Up-and-coming comic Kevin Han has a new show and its title can be taken literally. He is Extremely Tall and Incredibly Chinese. On the night I go, it could be that the crowd was too awkward or sober, but Han is quick on his feet and isn\u2019t deterred. Halfway through the show, the lights suddenly go off, but Han\u2019s quick-wittedness makes me think it is part of the performance. It was a true accident. Kevin Han is Extremely Tall and Incredibly Chinese at Storyville until April 20. Not everything is completely refined. But it is his second night. Jokes are targeted at an Australian audience, often delivered in surprising ways \u2013 his material moves from the relationship between Vietnamese and Lebanese people in western Sydney where Han grew up, to mixed-race relationships, Streets ice cream, and white Australian farmers. \u201cThere are racial jokes and there are racist jokes,\u201d Han explains about two-thirds into the show. It\u2019s true, and he\u2019s a master of the former \u2013 his work teeters on the edge of tipping into offence but never does, and often offers \u200bremarkable punchlines. At one point, Han admits that comedy is hard. He\u2019s not wrong: it requires much attention to detail while juggling multiple creative skills to deliver a show that looks effortless. A comic worth keeping an eye on.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Cher Tan\n\nNick Robertson | Everything that happened at Number 68\n\nChinese Museum \u2013 Tea Room until April 20 Do not be concerned if your phone battery is running low, Nick Robertson has a charger at the ready. He also serves cups of tea in mismatched mugs and offers cushions for extra seat comfort as you settle in. Nick Robertson outlines Everything That Happened at Number 68 at Chinese Museum until April 20. Robertson loves telling stories and it shows. With an excited glint in his eyes, and an endearing grin, he relays share house adventures. Eventualities that surface as he sifts through his barrage of memories from his early 20s (not that long ago) include an epic house party, living with an eclectic bunch of housemates and surviving an intense landlord. Robertson\u2019s exemplary knack of telling amusing tales shines through with references to yoga, footy and an adorable pet bunny. Finding out how the house ends up with a Soda Stream is a stand-out moment. There are occasional word stumbles peppering an otherwise engagingly executed performance. All in all, it\u2019s a fascinating hour of mirth and memories.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\n\nUrooj Ashfaq | It\u2019s Funny To Me\n\nMelbourne Town Hall \u2013 Powder Room, until April 20 Urooj Ashfaq is on a mission to deliver a sexy, dirty, edgy show \u2013 mostly to disprove a British critic who called her \u201cconservative\u201d. The miniskirt is part of it, as are smutty double entendres about reading erotica and being the first woman in her family to be diagnosed with haemorrhoids. Urooj Ashfaq\u2019s It\u2019s Funny To Me plays at Melbourne Town Hall until April 20. The show is strong on crowd work, though it\u2019s mostly utilised to implore embarrassed young South Asian men to maintain eye contact with her when she\u2019s talking about sex \u2013 to great comedic effect. She\u2019s nimble in responding to her surroundings, garnering some of the loudest laughs as she remarks on a passing ambulance. Ashfaq is at her strongest when she\u2019s delivering darkly funny throwaway lines that belie her persona as a fresh-faced ingenue, whether it\u2019s about living as a Muslim Indian woman in the Subcontinent or why being grounded doesn\u2019t make cultural sense as a punishment. There are two extended bits in her routine: one about her exploits as an ill-disciplined high school student, the other drawing on a piece of One Direction fan fiction. They\u2019re amusing at the offset, but perhaps mined beyond their comedic potential by the end. On the back of Ashfaq\u2019s award-winning 2023 debut show, Oh No!, It\u2019s Funny to Me is a solid set that veers towards the expected with moments of brilliance.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nBubble Laboratory | Bubble Show in Space\n\nMelbourne Museum, until April 20 Eccentric duo Dr Bubble and Milkshake take children on a high energy, sudsy adventure through space. The show is filled with non-stop mayhem, incorporating shadow and hand puppets, slapstick comedy and high-stakes bubble tricks. There\u2019s audience participation as kids are invited on stage as \u201caliens\u201d to engage in the foamy fun. Dr Bubble and Milkshake in the Bubble Show in Space, at Melbourne Museum until April 20. As a parent, it might feel chaotic and the space storyline a little tenuous. However, constructing an almost hour-long, all-ages show with enough variety to keep kids entertained is no mean feat. Even when the stunts go awry, the entertainers do well to stall, restart and keep the show going. It\u2019s a joy to watch young audiences gasp in awe as the pair create a giant bubble that snakes around the stage or giggle as Milkshake and Dr Bubble play tricks on each other. It eventually descends into carnage as bubbles fill the theatre and kids race towards the stage to immerse themselves in it all.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nTaylor Griffiths | Sublime Avenue\n\nTheory Bar, until April 20 It\u2019s never a good sign when the biggest laughs in the room are coming from your own tech person. Taylor Griffiths is a mainstay on the sketch and improv scene around Melbourne, and it\u2019s clear where she gets her influences from. But unlike the utter commitment to the bit of Hannah Camilleri, or the audacious and ridiculous characters of Nat Harris, her act is poorly structured and centres on cookie-cutter depictions with clumsy delivery. Taylor Griffiths on Sublime Avenue. She performs at Theory Bar until April 20. A sketch portraying a Metricon Homes sales pitch well outstays it\u2019s welcome, before returning again \u2026 and again. A boorish construction supervisor berates his fellow tradies with a bro-first mentality. There is little creativity and individuality within the characters that live on the titular avenue \u2013 worse, many of them are accompanied by D-grade jokes. Griffiths is no doubt trying to channel the bogan-chic of Kath & Kim, but the finesse and slick writing that made Fountain Lakes shine is in another stratosphere. There are bones of a decent sketch show here \u2013 but little else.\n\n\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\n\nSharam Namdarian | From Brunswick with Love\n\nDoubleTree Hilton, until April 20 Not every stand-up show needs to push the boundaries of comedy, but sticking to a tried-and-true formula can work against an artist \u2013 familiarity begets a certain colourlessness. Sharam Namdarian is From Brunswick with Love and plays at DoubleTree by Hilton. Sharam Namdarian\u2019s latest show, From Brunswick with Love, is a bit like that \u2013 it may be that he\u2019s used to radio and TV formats, having appeared on triple J and Channel Seven. It isn\u2019t really about Brunswick either. But that\u2019s fine: the label on the tin doesn\u2019t necessarily need to match what\u2019s inside. He moves swiftly between bits, and reveals, as mentioned in the show\u2019s synopsis, that he used to be a \u201crelationship coach\u201d. Yet that\u2019s the joke and the punchline \u2013 we never get to hear much more about it. So, toxic masculinity: tick; being mistaken as white as a light-skinned person of colour: tick; \u201cthe ethnic voice\u201d: tick; artificial intelligence and apps: tick; \u201cthis modern life\u201d: tick; \u201cnot seeing colour: tick. Namdarian is not entirely unfunny, but the material isn\u2019t particularly refreshing. There\u2019s a feeling of having seen this before; there are only so many ways to rehash a joke.\n\n\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Cher Tan",

MUSIC\n\nBach, Stravinsky & Spohr\n\nSydney Symphony Fellows in Concert\n\nSydney Opera House, April 11\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd This concert by the Sydney Symphony Fellows and their mentors began with a supreme masterpiece of the 18th-century concerto grosso genre, Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G. It continued with the same genre just over 200 years later, as seen through the 20th-century\u2019s neo-classical distorting lens in Stravinsky\u2019s Concerto in E flat, Dumbarton Oaks.\n\nIn the outer movements of the Bach, confidently led by violinist Natalie Mavridis (with SSO associate concertmaster Alexandre Osborne and harpsichordist Thomas Wilson), the nine concertante string players (three each of violins, violas and cellos) exchanged motifs with buoyant momentum, switching between solo, trio and accompaniment roles as Bach continuously regroups the players in a joyous variety of combinations. By the time Stravinsky revisited this style, its characteristic ideas had stiffened into convention and recycling them unadjusted was no longer an option. Although the opening theme of Dumbarton Oaks (led by Liam Pilgrim) has passing similarity to ideas in Bach\u2019s first movement, Stravinsky clips the rhythm unpredictably and makes the harmonies collide as though cut up and rearranged in a cubist painting. The Fellows\u2019 performance, under conductor Tim Constable (percussionist for the SSO) was generally tight in the unpredictable metres of the outer movements, and persuasive in the second where Stravinsky specifies intricately specific articulation (some motives could have been chiselled more insistently). In the arrangements for brass quintet of four pieces from Monteverdi\u2019s Fourth Book of Madrigals which followed, the challenge was to rediscover the natural melodic shape of lines written for the voice with modern brass instruments. Using flugelhorns for the upper parts in the slow languorous madrigals and trumpets for the march-like faster ones, the brass quintet (with SSO player Brent Grapes as mentor), produced smooth euphony and warm balance, spiced with strings of dissonant suspensions. The final work, Louis Spohr\u2019s Grand Nonet in F major, Opus 31 (1813) uses one each of the four string instruments, and one each of the woodwind plus horn, and is full of amiable ideas, conceived more for salon than concert hall. The string sound was less strongly projected than the woodwind, but the Fellows maintained musical geniality through close listening and carefully matched nuance.\n\nMUSIC\n\nLumen Machine\n\nEnsemble Offspring\n\nThe Nielson, ACO on the Pier. April 12\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first concert of Ensemble Offspring\u2019s 30th anniversary year foregrounded digital technology as a tool of musical extension, creation and transformation. Digital technology pervades much of today\u2019s musical world (even when you don\u2019t want it to), and is not the new frontier it was in the 1980s when works such as Pierre Boulez\u2019s Repons opened a new world of live performance possibilities. Ensemble Offspring\u2019s Claire Edwardes. This program was notable for its energy and variety as much as for its neat new devices. The first work, Weight and Load #2, by German composer Brigitta Muntendorf, was of interest as much for what it wasn\u2019t as for what it was. Eschewing conventional concepts of musical grace and beauty in both classical and popular spheres, it began with a bludgeoning beat across all instruments including a \u201cvirtual piano\u201d played in the air by pianist Zubin Kanga in which sensors translated hand gestures to sounds. When melodic motifs appeared, they were mechanical and emotionally empty, with an expression of denial reminiscent of Lucky\u2019s dance in Waiting for Godot. Kanga\u2019s own work From the Machine (after Eastman) drew on the work of singer and composer Julius Eastman (notable for his recording of Peter Maxwell Davies\u2019 Eight Songs for a Mad King).\n\nKanga blended scales and timbres at the synthesiser, waving a Genki Wave ring on his finger to change echo and resonance, somewhat like the distortions of a \u201cwobble board\u201d. Amanda Cole\u2019s Dream Garden introduced the fresh intervals and chords of just intonation, based on the natural harmonic series rather than the compromises usually made in modern scales and keys. Instrumental players adjusted the pitch of notes to those played by Kanga on a Lumatone keyboard (slightly over-dominant in the sound mix) to produce serene and tranquil textures over four movements, Unfurling, Insects, Rain, and Rainbows. Anna Meredith\u2019s Bumps Per Minute celebrated the crass hyperactivity of popular digital styles unashamedly. Its four movements were an arrangement for electronics, keyboard (Kanga) and vibraphone (Ensemble Offspring director Claire Edwardes) by Jessica Wells of short pieces Meredith originally wrote for an art installation in which the collisions of dodgem cars triggered outbursts of digitised music. Tristan Coelho\u2019s Hot Take offered a comment on the crassness and superficiality of modern discourse and resonated with Muntendorf\u2019s piece in both sound and idea. It began with brash musical gestures thrown out wave upon wave by the players, with barking repetitions from bass clarinet and cello, arpeggios on the piano and emphatic thuds from vibraphone and bass drum. The resonance hovered around the ensemble and was again controlled by Kanga with the Genki Wave ring so that it redoubled and turned in on itself. Melodic ideas fitfully tried to break through and eventually established a quieter phase on solo violin (Veronique Serret) suggesting more authentic musical reflection. The bass clarinet tried to revive the earlier raucousness but its energy was spent.\n\nMUSIC\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nQudos Bank Arena, April 8\n\nReviewed by JAMES JENNINGS\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nCyndi Lauper\u2019s life has been more colourful life than most, a fact underlined by an MTV-style montage that kicks off the Sydney leg of her farewell tour. It\u2019s all there: the bold \u201980s fashions and multicoloured hair, the global hits, the vibrant music videos, the campaigning for LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights. They\u2019re all crucial elements of Lauper\u2019s enduring appeal, but her distinct, four-octave vocal range and ability to belt out a song like every cell in her body is vibrating has always impressed the most. It\u2019s a thrill to hear it in action on \u201980s classics like The Goonies \u2018R\u2019 Good Enough and She Bop, which deliver a potent nostalgia hit for the crowd, many of whom are decked out in fluoro wigs and fishnet stockings. Cyndi Lauper performs as if every cell in her body is vibrating. Credit: Martin Philbey\n\nAfter the sugar rush opening, Lauper takes the first of many breaks to talk to the audience. By the time the gig is done, there will be about as much chatting as tunes. While that might be a major strike for most artists, it\u2019s a positive for Lauper, who is equal parts charming and funny, regaling us with engaging tales about her life in her distinct Noo Yawk accent. There\u2019s a roughly chronological run of songs from throughout Lauper\u2019s career, including some choice covers that show off her range and ability to traverse genres: a Mardi Gras in New Orleans-invoking Iko Iko; Wanda Jackson\u2019s country-rock classic Funnel of Love; and Frankie Laine\u2019s I\u2019m Gonna Be Strong. While there are a few occasions when Lauper, understandably, doesn\u2019t quite hit the high notes like she used to, there are still plenty of moments where she does, like on a thrilling version of Money Changes Everything and chill-inducing Time After Time, which may be the best song of the night. Yes, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun is saved for last and it\u2019s still a blast to hear 42 years later, but True Colours best encapsulates Lauper\u2019s spirit. In a show full of striking set design, the image of Lauper singing what has become a gay anthem, with a fan-blown rainbow scarf dancing above her, is both iconic and poignant, and a perfect example of an artist who\u2019s always poured her heart into her art. If it really is the final time Lauper plays live in Sydney, it\u2019s a wonderful way to go out.\n\nTHEATRE\n\nBIG GIRLS DON\u2019T CRY\n\nBelvoir St Theatre, April 9\n\nUntil April 27\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd I\u2019m sure Megan Wilding doesn\u2019t mean to steal scenes, but her physical acting, timing and control of her vocal pitch are so complete she\u2019s a magnet for the eyes and ears. Even with very fine actors, you sometimes see the craft underpinning their art. With Wilding, you just see the character she plays, and laugh at every jot of comedy this character conveys. In Dalara Williams\u2019 Big Girls Don\u2019t Cry, here having its world premiere directed by Ian Michael, Wilding plays Queenie, the most rambunctious of three young black women living in Redfern in the mid-1960s. Her friends are Cheryl (played by Williams, herself) and Lulu (an amusing Stephanie Somerville), and their camaraderie is a bulwark against the racism that pervades their daily lives. Megan Wilding (left) with Stephanie Somerville. Credit: Stephen Wilson Barker\n\nWilliams draws on stories she was told by women who lived through this era, and references the 1964 establishment of the Foundation of Aboriginal Affairs, the 1965 Freedom Ride confronting racism in New South Wales towns, and the run-up to the 1967 referendum that saw Aboriginal people finally included in the population. Vietnam is there, with Cheryl\u2019s boyfriend, Michael (Mathew Cooper) writing to her from the war, and 60s-style pop music (by Brendan Boney) sprays the air, hence the titular reference to The Four Seasons\u2019 1962 hit. Yet, despite the bigotry experienced by the women and Cheryl\u2019s brother Ernie (Guy Simon), notably at the hands of a local cop (Bryn Chapman Parish), the play spends most of its time riding on a rare lightness of humour. Williams shoots for neither raucous laughs nor laboured satire, but a gentle comedy of manners, interwoven with conflicting love stories, primarily with Cheryl falling for Ernie\u2019s friend Milo (Nic English) while Michael\u2019s away. Ernie, who bears the physical brunt of the racism, is proudly defiant, gleefully explaining to Milo that Australia\u2019s whites are bizarrely loyal to the same crown that kicked their own ancestors out of Great Britain. When he\u2019s arrested for little more than breathing, and Queenie\u2019s fired for being late for work, the play darkens. Here, however, Williams becomes less assured. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my job, but I\u2019m not ready to lose my dignity,\u201d Queenie declares, and even Wilding can\u2019t save the line. Chapman Parish (who later is highly amusing as Lulu\u2019s deferential date) has only a shrill white supremacist to work with as the cop, and the increased drama somehow doesn\u2019t equate to increased tension. The problem is compounded when the second half of the three-hour play begins with Cheryl enunciating the debilitating effects of racism, as if Williams has shrugged off her character, and is addressing us as the playwright. The information was already implicit. After this lapse, she steers her play back to the earlier deftness of tone, notably in a scene between Ernie and Queenie on a park bench, with Simon perfectly catching Ernie\u2019s awkwardness, while succeeding emotions play across Wilding\u2019s face.\n\nMozart & Bruckner\n\nSydney Symphony Orchestra\n\nSydney Opera House, April 9\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The opening work, Kate Moore\u2019s Blue Light Sphere, began suddenly with an energised texture of plucked notes and pulsating repetitions on percussion, all embellishing a single chord. That chord ended up being sustained for the entire eight-minute piece, and the combination of intense micro-activity within harmonic stasis conveyed a sense of swirling movement within a context of equilibrium. Denying herself the resource of harmonic movement, Moore relied on modal inflection, shifts in orchestration and texture, and irregular rhythmic impulses. Sometimes a line would momentarily be highlighted with iridescence before receding into the surrounding motion like a rotating object in space catching a distant light. The strategy of building a piece on a single harmony with varied orchestration is akin to that used by Schoenberg in his orchestral piece Farben, but the effect here was of a more vivid sense of presence within a state of transcendence.\n\nTo fill up the short first half, Lise de la Salle then played Mozart\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 19 in F, K. 459 with pert brilliance and vivacity. De la Salle maintained a strongly projected, marble-edged sound that favoured the piano, though sometimes at the expense of woodwind detail (for example, in the first movement). She drove the finale with insistence and brisk pianistic competence. In Bruckner\u2019s Symphony No. 7 in the second half, the music shifted gear, to ideas that unfolded over paragraphs rather than phrases. Conductor Lawrence Renes subdued the violins at the start to a hushed murmur while the cellos and horn unfolded the broad opening theme with carefully nuanced gradations, growing in grandeur and magnificence with repetition. At the close of that movement, the horns recalled that moment with a sound of sun-drenched warmth. The transition from that moment to the darker, premonitory sound of the so-called \u201cWagner tubas\u201d (sitting just behind the horns) who, with violas, play the first theme of the second movement, is like watching that sun-drenched object change mood as the sun becomes cloud-covered. Bruckner said the theme came to his mind just as he realised that the ageing Wagner, whom he had just met in Bayreuth, might shortly die, and Renes allowed its structure to unfold at its own majestic pace without dragging to a point of climactic culmination. For the third movement, Renes and the orchestra established an effective tempo of incisive vigour enlivened by crisp articulation, and moved to the fourth movement without a break (thus heading off distracting applause). Transparently balanced woodwind clarity, glowing strength from the brass and furious intensity from the strings all gave Bruckner\u2019s expansive, sometimes surprising finale rewarding cogency and impact.\n\nMUSIC\n\nSex Pistols\n\nHordern Pavilion, April 8\n\nReviewed by GEORGE PALATHINGAL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 We\u2019ve just heard three of his heroes tear through a seething Pretty Vacant, with Frank Carter himself getting to live his dreams and gleefully sneer and snarl his way through it with both them and an ecstatic crowd - but the fill-in frontman is not happy. Carter, a slight but ferocious cult hero of 21st-century Brit punk (former bands: Gallows, Pure Love, Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes), has on this tour been given the mammoth task of replacing John \u201cJohnny Rotten\u201d Lydon alongside original Pistols Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook. He\u2019s not quite as unhappy as the uninvited Lydon, but Carter nonetheless berates us for booing Jones\u2019 talk of the crowds in Adelaide and Melbourne being better. So he takes matters into his own hands, wades into the crowd, gets a sizeable circle-pit going and howls Bodies from it.\n\nThis Sex Pistols tour is way more exciting than it has any right to be. Credit: Martin Philbey It\u2019s a magnificent moment in a gig that\u2019s far more exciting than it has any right to be, but it\u2019s not our fault there\u2019s limited atmosphere for most of it. Curtains are hiding most of the chairs up the sides of the Hordern and the room is perhaps half-full at best. So while the band, and those who turned up, do everything they can to tear off the roof, there simply isn\u2019t enough energy to do so. Still, these Pistols are firing. They play in full, but not in order, their only proper album, Never Mind the Bollocks, and while obviously not having the culture-shattering impact it had on its 1977 release, it still thrills relentlessly, largely thanks to Jones\u2019 scorching riffs and Carter\u2019s energy and vocals \u2013 the latter adding to a superlative approximation of these past glories rather than being a flat-out imitation of Rotten memories. And on the subject of handy stage names, mercifully there\u2019s little Vicious about this night\u2019s take on My Way, as stupidly warbled by Sid in The Great Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Swindle, which Carter sings quite sweetly before it kicks off after its first chorus.",

    "text": "Dreaming of sipping a spritz in Italy this year? You might want to check the exchange rate first.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlights, accommodation, meals, and insurance \u2014 many things can become more expensive when your dollar doesn't go as far.\n\n\n\nCould Trump's tariffs disrupt your travel plans?\n\nBut on Wednesday, before these developments, the Aussie dollar fell to 59.15 US cents \u2014 its weakest point in about five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has since recovered slightly, buying about 62 US cents. The Aussie dollar is also weaker against the Euro, buying about 55 euro cents \u2014 down from 58 euro cents last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the dip, Dr Luke Hartigan, lecturer at the University of Sydney and a former Reserve Bank economist, warned against assuming price hikes across the board just yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thinking back to when the dollar went below 50 [US] cents back in the 2000s, it didn't lead to immediate, massive price rises. Many businesses absorbed the costs or hedged against them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies that rely on overseas imports often protect themselves through currency hedging, locking in exchange rates in advance. This means some travel-related costs may not spike immediately, but if the dollar stays low for months, you could feel the pinch more at the petrol pump or when booking international flights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fuel and air travel \u2014 those will be reflected quite soon, I imagine,\" Hartigan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is likely to be reflected immediately is consumers deciding to travel locally. So you may end up going to Queensland or just to Cairns instead of going overseas, with the exception of New Zealand. That's the one country our dollar always never falls against.\"\n\n\n\nAre people still planning to travel? If yes, then where?\n\nSydney resident Laura said she's had to change her travel plans to Europe in July due to the poor exchange rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was planning to go Greece and Italy this year, but I ended up changing it to Thailand. A lot of my friends are having their Euro summer in Southeast Asia now,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have family in London that I was going to stay with, but even then, I lose half of my money as soon as I land because of how bad the Aussie dollar is compared to the British Pound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd rather have a holiday where I know I can get way more for my money, which takes me a lot longer to save up due to the cost of living here in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n'Travel is a price elastic good'\n\nA study released by the Tourism and Transport Forum (TTF) that surveyed Australians about their travel plans from 1 December 2024 to 28 February 2025 showed that despite the rising cost of living continuing to strain Australians' wallets, a significant portion of the nation still planned to prioritise travel.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSW and Queensland emerged as the most popular destinations for those travelling domestically, while Aussies headed overseas were most likely to visit New Zealand, Japan or Europe, according to the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nTTF CEO Margy Osmond said despite the age-old advice to book in early, Australians have indicated their openness for a last-minute travel plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether it's due to the busy end-of-year schedule or looking out for a final-hour deal, most Australians have said that they\u2019d book a holiday less than a month in advance. Almost a third would even wait until a few days out from departure to get organised,\" she said in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Professor Sara Dolnicar from The University of Queensland who specialises in travel and tourism said travel is a \"very price elastic good\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Given the current cost of living crisis and now the low Australian dollar, when it comes to tourism, it reacts strongly to price changes or income changes,\" she said.\n\n\n\nDolnicar said consumer behaviour has shifted post-pandemic, with Australians now showing a stronger preference for international holiday destinations over domestic ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The pandemic taught us that we actually can have a nice holiday close to home. I was hoping that realisation would linger, especially for sustainability purposes. But in Australia, that hasn't been particularly the case,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Australians still have this very strong desire to travel internationally. We have destinations like Europe and the United States that are somehow idealised in what it means to us to have a specific kind of holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So for Australians, it's not about giving up on the dream ... but instead to delay it for when it becomes more affordable.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE New travel deal to allow Australians faster entry through US airports\n\nThe global impact of economic uncertainty\n\nBut beyond Australia, the global economic outlook is not exactly positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The US for sure [is at risk of recession],\" Hartigan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Businesses are likely to shelve investment plans, and consumers are tightening their purse strings. You amplify that across everything \u2014 cars, coffee, chocolate, even game consoles being delayed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said trade-heavy, low-income countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh are also feeling the sting of global tariff wars and slower consumer demand \u2014 all of which eventually ripple through supply chains and travel costs.\n\n\n\nTravel tips for a weak dollar economy\n\nIf you're still keen to travel internationally, a few savvy moves can help ease the blow:\n\n\n\nBook early. Lock in flights and accommodation while rates are stable\n\nUse hedged travel cards or lock in exchange rates early\n\nTravel during off-peak seasons and look for deals on flights and stays\n\nWatch your destination's currency\n\nConsider package deals, these can bundle costs and reduce exposure to fluctuating exchange rates",

    "text": "On opposite sides of the country, the major parties will use duelling election campaign launches to promise $10 billion of taxpayer money each for centrepiece policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton will on Sunday pledge a tax break of up to $1,200 for millions of low and middle income earners, with the cash delivered in this year\u2019s tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese will target first-home buyers with a commitment to build up to 100,000 new homes, and a major expansion of the scheme that allows new entrants to the market to buy a property with a 5 per cent deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor\u2019s official launch will be held in Perth, in a sign of the significance the campaign is placing on seats in the resources state, and Albanese moving to capitalise on the popularity of the state brand after its election success in March .\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Liverpool in south-western Sydney has been chosen for the Liberal campaign launch, highlighting the importance Dutton is placing on a raft of marginal seats in outer Sydney that it's trying to win.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Labor was first out of the blocks in cementing this date for the launch, the Liberals have now countered the government\u2019s campaign claim that the Opposition is the party of higher taxes.\n\n\n\nThe Coalition's pitch: a tax return windfall this year\n\nIf elected, the Coalition says its tax cut, dubbed the Cost of Living Tax Offset, would deliver cash back to more than 10 million voters in this year\u2019s tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tax break would be applied to those earning up to $144,000, and calculated to deliver up to $1,200 back at the end of the financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Opposition, around 85 per cent of taxpayers will benefit and half of all taxpayers will be able to access the full amount because they earn between $48,000 and $104,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAustralians are hurting \u2014 and Anthony Albanese isn\u2019t listening,\u201d Dutton said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Coalition is stepping up with a plan that provides real help.\"\n\n\n\nLabor is already promising a two-year tax cut that would come into effect next year, delivering about $5 a week in the first year and $10 in the second year.

This policy, to be outlined on Sunday, is designed to neutralise that line of attack.\n\n\n\nOpposition treasury spokesperson Angus Taylor described the tax relief as \u201ctemporary and targeted\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition has already pledged to cut the fuel excise by 25 cents a litre and has released modelling suggesting its policy to reserve gas for the domestic market will reduce gas and electricity bills.\n\n\n\nLabor\u2019s play: Addressing the housing shortage\n\nUnder the $10 billion policy being unveiled on Sunday, $2 billion would be set aside for grants while $8 billion would be ploughed into zero-interest loans or equity investments.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates and territories would be required to match funding, and there would be a focus on government land that is vacant or underused, more work on fast-tracking land release and planning approvals as well as zoning changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first homes would start to be built from July next year, with the first completions likely a year after that.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Albanese seeks sunshine in Queensland but campaign trail could soon turn cold\n\nLabor has been under pressure over its broader pledge to building 1.2 million homes by 2030 by the end of the decade , but maintains the target can still be met.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Home Guarantee Scheme that allows the purchase of a property with a 5 per cent deposit will also be expanded to all first home buyers with no income caps or caps on the number of places.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth guarantees mortgages to allow a reduced 5 per cent deposit without Lenders Mortgage Insurance being payable.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor is promising a dramatic increase in the cap on the price of homes that would be eligible for the 5 per cent deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sydney, it will be lifted from the current $900,000 cap to $1.5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nA $1 million property in Sydney could be purchased with a $50,000 deposit under this scheme, in a move aimed at helping new buyers and taking pressure off retirement savings for older generations.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Billions pledged: What the parties are promising for your health this election\n\n\"I want to help young people and first home buyers achieve the dream of home ownership,\u201d Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen a young person saves a 5 per cent deposit, my government will guarantee the rest with their bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis will help people buy their first home faster, without paying the burden of Lenders Mortgage Insurance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has already announced significant cost of living support, including $ 150 off power bills over the next two quarters , freezing the cost of medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and funding more bulk-billed GP visits nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has matched the health spending commitments.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2019, Dr Fan Yang from the University of Melbourne has been studying misinformation - incorrect information - about Australian elections on Chinese super app, WeChat.\n\n\n\n\n\nOwned by tech giant Tencent, it's an app of everything - where you can not only message friends, but also share posts, follow media outlets and watch short videos.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for Dr Yang, who will be monitoring the platform for third consecutive federal election, it's a place for disinformation - deliberately incorrect information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're under-prepared to address or intervene disinformation and misinformation being circulated within either Chinese English-speaking communities or non-English speaking communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the 2016 federal election, there have been concerns that WeChat has been flooded with misinformation about major parties, policies and even how to vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere've also been reports of disinformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, almost one in five Australians speak a language other than English at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of them use non-English social media platforms such as WeChat.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 report by the Lowy Institute shows over half of Chinese-Australians aged 18 to 44 use WeChat daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, another China-owned social app, RedNote, has gained popularity, with more than half of the Chinese population in Australia actively using the app.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Yang says even with the increased number of non-English social apps in Australia, there's still no systemic approach to regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDisinformation and misinformation online, circulated around non-English speaking communities, or circulated within closed, private channels, has long been overlooked by Australian regulatory bodies and also national media outlets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd even when the federal government has looked at regulating misinformation it hasn't extended to non-English platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe compared the two versions of combating misinformation, disinformation bill in 2023 and 2025 and we found that non English language disinformation, misinformation sources was not included into the bill at all, and the bill also didn't target non-American social media services or non-popular, non-mainstream social media services such as WeChat, RedNote, etc. And also, the bill was abandoned by the government in November 2024.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how difficult it is to reduce the effects of misinformation?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter going through thousands of posts containing misinformation, Dr Yang says there are often common themes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of the disinformation narrative that we have been observing and have been collecting, they are quite repetitive, which means if we want to devise strategies to pre-bunk (preemptively warn people about) disinformation narratives, we can do that. But so far, I don't see lots of resources devoted or invested in debunking or prebunking disinformation at this stage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Yang says many community members rely on their families to fact-check information online, usually relying on the younger, digitally savvy family members who speak fluent English.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut before being able to debunk misinformation, people need to know how the electoral system works, and that's not always the case in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent report by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority shows only one in four Year 10 students are proficient in civic literacy, which covers concepts like democracy, how to make laws, and the roles of governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent research co-authored by Dr Yang shows over half of Chinese migrants don't know how Australia's political system works, with just under half of South Asian migrants saying the same thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's also what Hong Kong migrant and podcaster Suie Lo found when producing a Cantonese children's podcast on misinformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Lo arrived in Melbourne three years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving followed the heated discussions on misinformation, she feels it's necessary to help kids understand the idea of fact-checking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNowadays, we all know, after 2000, every kid was born in a internet world. And even as a parent, we cannot control every information provided by the internet when your kid grows up. So it is really important to let the kids know they need to know how to justify or how to figure out which information may not be that reliable, or may be misleading.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore she could deliver the content to the children of the Cantonese community, Ms Lo herself had to first master the skill of identifying fake news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy story is only one of an insight or idea to give the kids and the parents awareness of the misinfo or the information for the internet. So if the parents want to discuss with kids more deeply, they need to have more concrete ideas and concepts. I know that the government establish a department, it's about e-safety, and then they provide some information and also some classes for teachers to guide the kids about the digital world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the e-safety commissioner, the Australian Electoral Commission has been conducting civic education workshops in multicultural communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAEC spokesperson Evan Ekin-Smyth says it's been a focus as the election approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a number of in language facilitators who've been doing it in various areas. A lot of it's been in Western Sydney, but there's also areas across Victoria and some other places as well a range of different languages. It's about community need and identification of, you know, desire from community members to have this information. Typically, it looks like, you know, renting out a room in a council building, or whatever it might be, inviting local community members to come, and you might get 10 people, or 15 or 20 or whatever it is, and you have a conversation about Australia's voting system in language, and you provide resources and materials.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLast federal election, the AEC collaborated with some major WeChat channels to publish Chinese translations of its official materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, it met with WeChat to develop a referral pathway on the platform over election misinformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr Ekin-Symth says it's challenging to keep up with rapidly changing landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's a tricky space. This is not just in-language channels, this is all channels. The proliferation of social media channels has been significant, particularly over the last few years, there is a limit to the amount of places that we can go and the amount of money we can spend on advertising and the sort of presence that we can maintain on different channels.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this election, the AEC has a message to all voters: stop and think about the information you see online.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "United States President Donald Trump's administration has granted exclusions from steep \"reciprocal\" tariffs to smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a notice to shippers, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency published a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes. The exclusions are retroactive to 5 April.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US CBP listed 20 product categories, including the very broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means they will not be subject to the tariff rate on Chinese imports, which has effectively risen to 145 per cent, or the 10 per cent baseline tariffs elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe notice did not provide an explanation for the administration's move but the late-night exclusion provides welcome relief to major US technology firms including Apple, Dell Technologies and countless other importers.\n\n\n\nTrump's action excludes the specified electronics from his 10 per cent \"baseline\" tariffs on goods from most countries other than China, easing import costs for semiconductors from Taiwan and Apple iPhones produced in India.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Chinese imports, the exclusion only applies to Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs, according to a White House official.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's prior 20 per cent duties on all Chinese imports that he said were related to the US fentanyl crisis remain in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the official said Trump will launch a new national security trade investigation into semiconductors soon that could lead to other new tariffs.\n\n\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Trump has made clear the US cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she said that at Trump's direction, major tech firms, including Apple and chipmakers Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor \"are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exemptions suggest an increasing awareness within the US administration of the pain tariffs could inflict on inflation-weary consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmartphones were the top US import from China in 2024, while Chinese-built laptops were second, according to US Census Bureau data.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian share market has biggest daily gain in five years after Trump tariff backflip\n\nTrump campaigned to win back the White House last year largely on a promise to bring down prices that had rocketed and tarnished the economic reputation of former US president Joe Biden and his Democratic allies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Trump also promised as a candidate to impose the tariffs that have become a central part of his economic agenda, and the president has dismissed the turbulence in financial markets and expected price increases arising from the levies as a disturbance that was a necessary part of realigning the global economy and world trading order with his vision.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis so-called \"reciprocal tariffs,\" however, raised fears of a US recession and drew criticism from his fellow Republicans, who do not want to lose control of the US House of Representatives and Senate in next year's midterm elections to Democrats, who have sharply criticised Trump's policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina said on Friday it had increased its tariffs on US imports to 125 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has told reporters he was comfortable with the high tariffs on China but respected President Xi Jinping and believed something good would come out of the trade conflict between them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Trump paused most country-specific tariffs for 90 days following a plunge in global stock markets earlier this week, a 125 per cent levy remained in place for Chinese imports. A White House official later said he had imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods of 145 per cent since taking office.\n\n\n\n",

The cost would remain $7.70 for concession cardholders \u2014 a rate Labor has frozen until 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party also made $573 million women's health announcement ahead in February. As part of that, some women undergoing IVF now have earlier access to a medication that was previously only funded by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in later cycles. An oral contraceptive and endometriosis will be added to the PBS from 1 May. Also pledged was funding for 11 new endometriosis clinics; improved menopausal care through a new Medicare rebate for health assessments and the listing of meidcations on the PBS; better acess to IUDs and birth control implants, among other things.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn mental health, Labor has pledged $1 billion for mental health services , including:\n\n\n\n$225 million for 31 new and upgraded Medicare mental health centres\n\nMore than $200 million for 58 new, upgraded or expanded Headspace services\n\n$500 million for 20 youth specialist care centres for young people with complex needs\n\n$90 million for more than 1,200 training places for mental health professionals and peer workers\n\nCoalition\u2019s plan: Matching Medicare and mental health funding\n\nThe Coalition says it will match Labor's $573 million women's health and $8.5 billion Medicare packages, and its $25 price cap pledge on PBS medicines.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says the $8.5 billion Medicare pledge would build on an earlier $500 million commitment to increase the number of Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20. During COVID, the Coalition government increased the number of subsidised psychology sessions by the same amount, but Labor reduced them to the pre-COVID level after winning the 2022 election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has also promised a $5 million review into women-specific items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS to ensure affordable access.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition says it wants to place \"Australia at the forefront of youth mental health treatmen in the world\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has pledged a $400 million investment into youth mental health services, and says it will expand the National Centre for Excellence in Youth Mental Health.\n\n\n\nThe Greens\u2019 plan: Medicare for mental and dental health\n\nThe Greens have positioned themselves as the only major party proposing a major expansion of Medicare, with a policy to include fully subsidised dental and mental health services.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir $195 billion Medicare investment, would make dental visits and mental health care available through the public system with no gap fees \u2014 a reform the party says is essential to health equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn mental health, the Greens have pledged:\n\n\n\nFunding of $400 million in grants for community mental health organisations\n\nCreating a systematic approach to suicide prevention by legislating a National Suicide Prevention Act with a $180 million investment to ensure alignment across all levels of government\n\nEnsure safe and culturally responsive mental health care by investing $15 million to train all mental health practitioners in gender affirmation, anti-discrimination, and cultural responsiveness.\n\nThe Greens have also promised:\n\n\n\nFree ADHD and Autism assessments under Medicare\n\nIncrease access to medicinal cannabis by allocating $10 million over 2 years to fund a working group to investigate listing medicinal cannabis on the PBS\n\nCommit $2 million to fund a review of the accessibility of telehealth services\n\n$30.6 billion in local public hospitals nationwide.",

Pharoah was threatened by the Israelite's might and power, so wanted to keep them as slaves. And so essentially the Jews asked God for help and God sent them Moses. And with the help of God and Moses, they eventually liberated the Jews from the land of Egypt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Biblical story, 10 plagues were inflicted on Egypt by the God of Israel, to convince the Pharaoh to set the slaves free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You had locusts and lice and terrible storms, and it all culminated in the 10th plague, which was the most intense, which was the death of the firstborn of every Egyptian family. And in order to preclude themselves from this misery, the Jews had to rub lamb's blood on their doorposts. So then God would pass over their house.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most significant parts of Passover is a ceremonial feast called a Seder which takes place on the first night or first two nights of the holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoni Cohavi is the Parramatta and District Synagogue Rabbi.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the Seder can take many forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Usually it's a family celebration, when the family sits around the Pesach Seder table. These days we also have community Seders, where the community, or part of the community comes together. And we sit around the Seder table, and we read the Haggadah. The Haggadah is the story of Pesach, the story of the Exodus from Egypt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Olenski says traditionally there are six items on the Seder plate, each symbolising different parts of the Exodus story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The hard-boiled egg reminds us of the destruction of the Temple but also instils us with hope. It symbolises the circle of life... Maror is usually represented by horseradish. It symbolises the bitter struggle of slavery that the Jews had to endure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbi Cohavi says while Pesach is celebrated by all Jewish communities, there are differences in traditions and rituals across cultures.\n\n\n\n",

But middle class people, small business people, professional people, farmers, artisans, those sorts of people have no one to look after them. So that was the original base of the Liberal Party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was a strong advocate of the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act - more commonly known as the 'White Australia Policy'.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in 1966, the Liberal party changed laws, paving the way to abolish the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party is considered to be the more conservative of the two major parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd since the party is more politically conservative than well, liberal, the name might seem a bit confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst in other parts of the world the parties that oppose labour are often named conservative parties, George Brandis says that isn't what the original party was about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of the various options that Menzies had in choosing the name of his new party, he avoided calling it the Conservative Party, because he wasn't a conservative, he was a classical liberal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Sheppard says there is a conservative element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's two core streams of the Liberal Party, and one is what we would call liberal, but we often call that small 'l' liberal. What we mean there is a genuine belief that government is not here to help you, that you are your best advocate, that you should you can best decide how to live your life, and the less the government does, the better. The conservative stream of the Liberal Party does think that government is okay. They're much less resistant to the idea that government can solve our problems. But what they are less happy about are things like same sex marriage, open borders, you know, international students. They want a smaller, quieter Australia that looks more like it did in the 1960s. It's an incredibly at times, different set of principles that the Liberal Party is trying to manage. Under Peter Dutton, the party feels quite conservative. It feels like a party that just wants us to live quietly, does not want to rock the boat too much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOther well-known Liberal party policies include:\n\n\n\n\n\nResettling Vietnamese refugees after the Vietnam war in 1976\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing, yours truly, the Special Broadcasting Service in 1977\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing in tougher gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd creating Operation Sovereign Borders in 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the government has done is stop the boats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sheppard says the party would be proud of its economic achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Liberalization of the economy, you know, the ability for anyone in the middle class or working class to move up in society, to own their own business, to go to university if they wish, to live the kind of life that they choose that isn't tied to their occupation or to what their parents did. They would say that is their core achievement over the last 30 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the parties best known leaders include Harold Holt, who famously went missing in the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here is a news flash from the Herald Sun newsroom. An intense land, air, and sea search is continuing near Portsea's back beach for Prime Minister, Mr Holt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n...And John Howard, the second longest serving Prime Minister of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party was last in government in 2022 - and Scott Morrison was the last Liberal Party Prime Minister of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton is current leader, and will be the Prime Minister if the coalition wins the next election.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's been a politician for 25 years, and before then was a police officer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Party teams up with the Nationals in a coalition to form government.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Brandis describes it as...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A functional relationship. It's a necessary relationship. The National Party, though, is a very different beast from the Liberal Party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis election the Liberal Party's slogan is 'get Australia back on track', with policies including.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Building Australia's first nuclear reactor\n\n\n\n\n\n- Being tough on crime\n\n\n\n\n\n- Reducing wasteful spending, including cutting public service jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n- And reducing migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how does the party stack up to its original manifesto?\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty well, says Dr Sheppard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Weirdly, I think the Liberal Party is probably closer to its original party than the Labor Party is, even though they've never had a strong sense of purpose, necessarily, apart from opposing Labor, there's always been tension between conservatives and liberals inside the Liberal Party. That was the case in 1944 when the party was founded and its the case today.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAnandikaa Ramesh is a migrant from Sri Lanka, who is studying twin degrees at the University of Sydney. As a woman, her choice of software engineering and commerce is unusual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn my programming tutorials in class, usually women are the minority. So, in around 20 people, only four would be women like girls.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s something Anandikaa is used to. For her final school exams, she was among a small group of girls studying higher level maths at Penrith Selective High School in Sydney\u2019s west.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was really passionate and good at maths essentially, and I really liked problem solving and I just found that I was a logical thinker. In terms of software engineering, I found that it was very logical and algorithm based, which I really enjoyed particularly. And I just had a passion for commerce, so I thought it was best to combine both of them\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that places Anandikaa among just 37 per cent of women enrolled in university STEM courses nationwide. She hopes to inspire others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'd really love to be a role model for all those women and just people in minority backgrounds and immigrant backgrounds, which is predominantly where I'm from, Western Sydney.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a view shared by Sydney University\u2019s Associate Vice President Shane Griffin, who\u2019s spent almost two years developing a new school-to-university STEM pipeline, targeting young women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's no other program that's supporting students through their high school years, both in outreach and financially and then into university as well. So, it is a long-term project to make a substantial difference to a serious number of people. We're looking at putting out an additional sort of 300 plus graduates out into the workforce. We're just getting started, but it's a really exciting project for us .\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s all thanks to a $100-million dollar donation from tech founder Robin Khuda, who recently sold his data centre business, as Shane Griffin explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRobin is an international student himself from Bangladesh. Robin has seen a lack of diversity in his company and found it difficult to find female engineers and scientists.Employers everywhere have said for a long time there aren't enough women completing STEM degrees. So, to be able to support that and to widen that pool is really fantastic\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShane Griffin says the donation is one of the most significant targeting women in STEM worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the largest donation the university's ever received and as far as we are aware, the largest donation supporting women in STEM and focused on students and local students and their outcomes. So, the university's incredibly grateful.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multi-decade project is due to begin outreach from July this year, eventually reaching 40,000 high school students.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first pilot scholars are expected to enrol at Sydney University in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a move welcomed by Sally-Ann Williams, CEO of Cicada innovations and chair of the federal government\u2019s recent Pathway to Diversity in STEM review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI absolutely commend Robin Khuda and the University of Sydney for taking a very intentional approach to thinking about how they are going to work on changing the ratio of the number of women in engineering and computing and in STEM degrees. And it's very pleasing because that was one of the key recommendations in our review.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Sally-Ann Williams says more work is needed to boost diversity across government and private sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's still a really large gap in some of the STEM fields in Australia for participation of women and other underrepresented people, and that is primarily in the areas of engineering and largely in computing as well. It's actually critical that we're more diverse in the STEM sector - diversity of thought and lived experience, which includes backgrounds such as gender and socioeconomics, regional versus rural versus city. Research shows that diverse teams do create better outcomes and higher success metrics for companies and for government by the way, in policy. And it's because all points of view are considered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Anandikaa Ramesh, who expects to finish her engineering and commerce degrees in 2028, the goal is a career in financial technology. She hopes more women will soon join her.\n\n\n\n",

When I was 15, in the deep Millennial-era Australian suburbs, their single album, Never Mind the Bollocks (1977), represented the promise of punk: social anarchy, relative lack of skill, and branding genius. It\u2019s potent even today, five decades after their flash-in-the-pan heyday. The Sex Pistols perform on stage at Festival Hall on April 5, 2025. Credit: Martin Philbey For this tour, the band is back together for the first time in two decades, this time without former lead singer John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten. He no longer gets on with his bandmates. He\u2019s a vocal Trump supporter now, and he\u2019s described this tour as \u201cpuppetry\u201d and \u201ckaraoke\u201d. The Sex Pistols without John Lydon is a difficult prospect. To me, his unpredictable screech is what defined the band. It\u2019s INXS without Michael Hutchence, or Queen without Freddie Mercury. He\u2019d hate both comparisons, but he\u2019s not here to protest.\n\nTonight, the position is filled by Frank Carter, erstwhile singer from Gallows and the Rattlesnakes. In front of an image of two huge speakers marked \u201cNOWHERE\u201d and \u201cBOREDOM\u201d, the band members, aged in their late 60s \u2013 apart from Carter, 40 \u2013 lead us into a rousing Holidays in the Sun, followed by Seventeen. \u201cI\u2019m so lazy,\u201d Carter sings, not lazily. His voice is more Billie Joe Armstrong than Johnny Rotten, tight-wound and cover-band-accurate to the source material. But is accuracy what we want from a band who promised to rip up rock and roll and rebuild it? By Pretty Vacant, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s here to compere the old guard and foster a singalong. \u201cThe old boys deserve it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey f---in\u2019 invented this shit.\u201d They can\u2019t declare themselves \u201cthe greatest punk band in history\u201d, but he can. \u201cI\u2019m not an animal,\u201d they shout in Bodies, confined to their stage mics, while Carter is in the audience, crowd-surfing. The Sex Pistols have reunited for the first time in two decades. Credit: Martin Philbey The rest of the set, comprised mostly of tracks from their one album, passes without error, and I won\u2019t lie: I sing along, at times screaming. It\u2019s infectious, cathartic. In the encore, Carter leads us in a rendition of My Way, in tribute to the other absent Pistol, Sid Vicious, who allegedly killed his girlfriend Nancy Spungen, before dying of an overdose on bail. The band\u2019s manager sold T-shirts marking her death. They\u2019ve always been a branding exercise. After the show, most fans I ask are thrilled with the results. The pub around the corner from Festival Hall, the Angry Dog, is full of Sex Pistols fans, and the absence of Lydon is a win. Gail, from Glasgow, Scotland via Perth, WA, describes Lydon as \u201ca right-wing English prick.\u201d I overhear someone else describing Carter as a \u201cwanker\u201d. Better a wanker than a prick.\n\nReviewed by Will Cox\n\nDANCE\n\nShadow Text \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until April 12 Back from Brussels, where she is now based, choreographer Chloe Chignell returns with an enigmatic, bookish new contemporary dance work \u2013 co-created with Amina Szecs\u00f6dy \u2013 steeped in continental culture and sophistication. Shadow Text is a response to Monique Wittig\u2019s 1969 novel-length prose poem Les Gu\u00e9rill\u00e8res Credit: Rudy Carlier This is a welcome return, even if the show \u2013 a response to Monique Wittig\u2019s 1969 novel-length prose poem Les Gu\u00e9rill\u00e8res \u2013 is a little left field, a little opaque in its construction. Wittig\u2019s book, a cult classic, describes a radically feminist state at war with men. It has a splintered, incantatory style that gives it a dreamlike, almost mythic power. Chignell has an ongoing fascination with the relationship between writing and dancing, and here she responds as much to the book\u2019s eerie moonlit atmosphere as its story of epic conflict.\n\nThe two dancers \u2013 Chignell and Szecs\u00f6dy \u2013 begin with a simple, springy stepdance, which soon transforms into a slow, concentrated crawl as they circle the space, creating images of deliquesce and deformation. Some of this vocabulary echoes scenes from Wittig\u2019s novel \u2013 women riding into battle, swinging deadly bolos \u2013 but mostly it tries to body forth the book\u2019s queer, cloistered erotic intensity. Loading Wittig was a novelist but also a theorist, aligned with the mid-century French intellectual tradition that privileged text over speech, language over the body \u2013 where revolution begins with words. One aim of this project is to revisit and challenge these ideas, treating them \u2013 perhaps deliberately \u2013 as if they still hold more currency than they do. Hence the prominence of projected and spoken text in this show. Some of this is original and some of it is a revision of Les Gu\u00e9rill\u00e8res. The juxtapositions, however, between text and movement don\u2019t always create a strong impression, as if the shadow of the work\u2019s title is what lies between them. It\u2019s an intriguing performance, but I wish there was more contextual framing, because Shadow Text feels like a fragment of a larger and more urgent conversation unfolding elsewhere, just beyond our hearing.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nDANCE\n\nSpringCity 43214 \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until April 12 Interactive dance \u2013 where the audience helps steer what\u2019s performed \u2013 is an old idea that rarely gets a run outside the improv and comedy circuit. The last example I saw was Joel Bray\u2019s comic lecture staged in a suburban pub years ago. So, producer-performer MaggZ really is breaking new ground with this attempt at combining audience participation with higher-than-normal production values. Producer-performer MaggZ really is breaking new ground with SpringCity 43214. Credit: Simon L. Wong This is a serious attempt to integrate the audience without compromising on spectacle. Created by and for \u2013 as the show\u2019s website notes \u2013 the Asian diasporic community, the production borrows its aesthetic from arcade culture, transporting us to SpringCity 43214: a virtual, neon-noir, pan-Asian fantasia, with a backdrop of colourful animated patterns and a soundtrack ranging from ambient electronica to kitschy techno. Despite its game-like trimmings \u2013 character selection, a computerised voice-over \u2013 this isn\u2019t really a game. There\u2019s no contest, no quest, no real goal. The interactivity is more old-school. In the first round, for example, a performer with a microphone approaches audience members and offers them a selection of cards. They choose one, and a new style or task is announced. The dancers adjust accordingly.\n\nThe central character is played by MaggZ herself, with supporting roles performed by hitahhchi and Aqua. Early sections are deliberately slow, built around stylised group poses. It\u2019s not until the third sequence \u2013 which spills partly into the audience \u2013 that momentum builds, showcasing sharper street dance stylings. MaggZ, in particular, impresses with precision, speed and snap. The production is technically ambitious, syncing live interactions with shifting sound and light. But with only two performances, there\u2019s little time to bed things in. On opening night, the sound was a little too loud, and the lighting a little too dark, which meant the participatory elements felt confused. This is a show you\u2019d learn a lot from over time, but not, I think, in just two performances.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann MUSIC\n\nCyndi Lauper: The Farewell Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nRod Laver Arena, April 2 Cyndi Lauper walks on stage to an explosion of rainbow confetti and dives straight into She Bop, an ode to masturbation. She\u2019s 71 years old, 160 centimetres tall, and exuberant as hell in blue-green hair, blasting through a recorder solo before chucking the instrument offstage. Cyndi Lauper performs at Rod Laver Arena, April 2, 2025. Credit: Martin Philbey\n\nThe crowd are in tulle skirts, glitter and colourful wigs, which are on sale in the foyer \u2013 the money goes to her charity, Girls Just Wanna Have Fundamental Rights. Tonight is supposedly part of Lauper\u2019s farewell tour, and she\u2019s going out on top. She still has a voice like a box of crayons, bright, messy, and expressive. She uses everything, with soaring vibrato, sometimes audibly out of breath, imprecise and alive. The set is \u201980s-heavy, leaning most on her \u201983 debut She\u2019s So Unusual, with some middle-of-the-road \u201990s stuff and, to my delight, the song she did for The Goonies thrown in. Tonight is supposedly part of Lauper\u2019s farewell tour, and she\u2019s going out on top. Credit: Martin Philbey It\u2019s a talky night. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a bang-bang show,\u201d she says unapologetically in her irresistible Brooklyn drawl (\u201cIt\u2019s a paww-deee!\u201d). She tells us about family, the cousin who had a pigeon coop on her roof, the women who raised her and the way they\u2019d cut up old clothes and make something brand new with them. She does the same with her art, of course. Many of her songs are written by others but she makes them utterly her own. She tells us she recorded I Drove All Night, written for Roy Orbison, because there were no songs on the radio about women driving. \u201cWhen you get in the car and you can drive anywhere you freakin\u2019 want, that\u2019s a power song.\u201d\n\nShe cycles through about half-a-dozen costume changes, each with a different hair colour: sparkly, shoulder-padded jackets, asymmetrical suits, underwear on the outside, a floor-length Norma Desmond number, a red jacket with a bright yellow wig. \u201cI tried to dress up faw ya,\u201d she says. As this outfit\u2019s designer Christian Siriano told her: \u201cThe gays want glamour.\u201d Loading For the evergreen Time After Time, Melbourne\u2019s Tones and I joins for a duet that\u2019s like every wedding dance floor you\u2019ve ever been on: messy and beautiful. And she delivers True Colours flawlessly, standing on a small satellite stage in the middle of the arena with a long rainbow scarf metres in the air. For the finale, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, she\u2019s joined by The Veronicas, who sink into the background in a stage designed in polka-dot tribute to artist Yayoi Kusama. Even this, her signature tune, is a cover of a late-\u201970s pop-punk number, sung by a man, but I defy you to listen to that original and think of it as anything less than a sketch for Lauper to colour in and make something wonderful, defiant and punch-the-air fun.\n\nReviewed by Will Cox\n\nJAZZ\n\nMatthew Ottignon\u2019s Volant \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Jazzlab, April 4 Matthew Ottignon\u2019s latest album was conceived during a period of unusual calm for the composer-saxophonist. Back in Sydney after years of touring and performing in other people\u2019s bands, Ottignon finally found time to let his own creativity take flight. That idea of flight \u2013 and the freedom it embodies \u2013 resonates throughout the album, aptly titled Volant. Composer and saxophonist Matthew Ottignon. Credit: Greg Sheehan His current quartet has now adopted Volant as a band name, and it\u2019s the perfect moniker for an outfit that can glide and soar as naturally as a flock of birds. One of the tunes they played at Jazzlab on Friday night (Murmuring) was inspired by the flight of starlings, moving through the sky like an undulating cloud and capable of sudden, instinctive changes of direction. Swift, beating pulsations from Lauren Tsamouras\u2019 piano, Hannah James\u2019 bass and Hayley Chan\u2019s drums created a sense of propulsion and uplift as Ottignon\u2019s sax hovered, then ascended over a fast-moving landscape. Rolling and Circling exuded a similar energy, though with a more open, expansive feel. Ottignon\u2019s full-bodied tenor swept in circles over the rhythm section\u2019s turbulent sea, surging with soulful intensity before the waves unexpectedly settled and the sea grew calm.\n\nLoading Other tunes demonstrated the group\u2019s ability to evoke atmosphere through subtlety and nuance. Circular Breathing opened with a whisper of brushes on cymbals, arco bass and ghostly overtones from Ottignon\u2019s sax; Naturis conjured an air of mystery via brooding chord changes and an unhurried, rolling sway. But this is a band that also knows how to groove \u2013 even over odd meters and fitful rhythms. Rocky Lux saw the ensemble strutting breezily in a Latin-tinged 7/4; Bilpin set up an exuberant canter that bubbled with vitality; and on the final tune (Jetsetters), the quartet hopscotched nimbly across a stop-start pulse with playful precision, their visible delight radiating outwards and becoming an invisible current on which we, too, could take flight.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas DANCE\n\nPoesis and The Bastard \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until April 5 The latest Dancehouse double bill features two works that differ wildly in their commitments to technique and virtuosity, but which together make for an invigorating and provoking evening of dance theatre.\n\nGabriella Imrichova\u2019s cheekily titled The Bastard aims to challenge expectations with a surprising blend of theatre, performance art and only little dance. It\u2019s a bit punk and a bit mongrel, but consistently funny. Loading This is a performance in two halves. First, we get a dry parody of non-dance, a somewhat dated form of experimental dance in which movement is withheld: it\u2019s slow and repetitious and very low effort. Either side of this performance, Imrichova addresses the audience, simulating apprehension about its reception: about whether it fits the context and whether it works as dance. It\u2019s mischievous but not without charm. Then follows a wild rant about art and novelty. There were a few walkouts on opening night, but that\u2019s surely a victory for an artist who declares that trolling is a creative practice.\n\nPrue Lang\u2019s Poesis sits more securely within the conventions of contemporary dance. It\u2019s a duet in which the two dancers generate striking compositions from subtle contrasts in form, line and intention. Both performers are extraordinary. Benjamin Hancock, with his strange elongations, projects a kind of alien grace. And Tara Jade Samaya \u2013 returning to Melbourne after a long absence \u2013 is all strength and control. Poesis moves through various phases, the dancers arranging themselves in ways that are unexpected but visually satisfying, mixing traditions and vocabularies, folding themselves together and even improvising with a game of follow the leader. The costumes exaggerate the effects of counterpoint in interesting ways. Samaya appears in boxing gear while Hancock is in pointe shoes: there are luridly patterned unitards, absurd heels, lots of activewear and some deluxe furry boots. It\u2019s a little cerebral but nonetheless attractive. Imrichova has the freshness of a new voice, but Lang brings the more serious engagement with contemporary dance and its possibilities.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann",

After all, we share what Jones dubs \u201cthe Shakira approach\u201d to alcohol: whenever, wherever. Melbourne audiences adore her in return. In previous MICF shows, Jones declared that she was waiting for David Attenborough or his ilk to die so she could take on the coveted mantle of national treasure. Well, she\u2019s done waiting, this time gleefully declaring herself a national treasure multiple times. Frankly, it\u2019s hard to argue. From tales of meeting royals to single life and her dual passions (gravy and tits, natch), it\u2019s all first class. Fans of her takes on queer and disabled life will find plenty here too. She\u2019s cheekier, ruder, swearier, brasher and funnier than ever. Her audience croons with laughter; the love affair between city and comedian is clearly not one-sided.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nDavid Quirk | The House That Was Never Built\n\nCoopers Inn, until April 20 I\u2019ve attended every show by David Quirk since his 2013 exploration of his own infidelity, Shaking Hands with Danger. Twelve years later, I\u2019m still convinced that when he brings his A-game that he\u2019s the best storyteller in Australian comedy, even if his crowd sizes and venues suggest otherwise. David Quirk will perform The House That Was Never Built at Coopers Inn until April 20. Quirk acknowledges this. \u201cThis is one of the rare pubs in the central business district that retains a general soullessness,\u201d he laments, as he performs in a room above a sports bar where a level below most are betting on greyhounds. The House That Was Never Built centres on the inheritance of a small bit of land following the passing of both his parents, and his partner\u2019s encouragement for him to build a home. Quirk is no headspace to think about entering the housing market. He\u2019s barely making ends meet as a comedian and with a side hustle of painting other people\u2019s houses. To save money, he once moved from St Kilda to Fitzroy on the 96 tram.\n\nBut still, he persisted, and the hour follows his conversations with a draughtsman named Beau \u2013 a chain-smoking alcoholic whose flurries of trains-of-thought range from poetic, profound, but mostly profane. But Quirk finds a rare humanity in the discourse \u2013 and mines it for introspection on the human condition and privileges in life. It\u2019s a marvel to see this level of talent in such an intimate setting.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Tyson Wray Brendan Murphy | Buffy Revamped\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until April 20 Wearing a black tee, skinny jeans and Dr. Martens boots, a wiry, demonic gentleman with slicked-back, bleached blond hair and varnished black nails graces the stage. \u201cYou all Buffy fans, are ya?\u201d he inquires menacingly. It\u2019s none other than Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019s one-time paramour, Spike, played with campy flair by British comedian Brendan Murphy. Brendan Murphy\u2019s Buffy Revamped is at fortyfivedownstairs until April 20. Murphy\u2019s satirical one-man send up of the seven-season supernatural series is a hilarious trip down a \u201990s pop culture vortex, accompanied by a nostalgic soundtrack. The production perfectly encapsulates the Sunnydale essentials with moody lighting, smoke effects, a bookshelf, and a high school locker. The pointy stakes are aimed high, but Murphy\u2019s theatrical prowess is primed to absolutely kill it. From physical to musical comedy, accents to wigs, he playfully captures the characters and storylines while lightly mocking narrative holes and the unrealistic context (how did club Bronze survive on the patronage of minors?). In moments when the sold-out crowd doesn\u2019t respond as expected, Murphy\u2019s ad-libbed retorts still generate a laugh. Catch it before the hellmouth swallows Melbourne whole.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nNicole Gulasekharam | Casual Receptionist of the Quarter\n\nThe Motley Bauhaus \u2013 Cabaret Room, until April 20 \u201cI find as long as I am calm and non-threatening, and articulate, charismatic, submissive, present, resilient, likeable, agreeable, and mindful of something, it\u2019s usually fine,\u201d the titular receptionist, played by Nicole Gulasekharam, says about one-third of the way into this one-woman show. Nicole Gulasekharam is the Casual Receptionist of the Quarter at The Motley Bauhaus. And this is how Casual Receptionist of the Quarter goes: Gulasekharam greets customers and tries to resolve complaints behind a makeshift gym reception desk, all while rolling fresh towels and making occasional announcements into the loudspeaker to inform all gym-goers to please wipe down their equipment before leaving. This is workplace comedy at its best. In between scenes at the gym, we learn that the protagonist is a struggling 24-year-old musician who has had to move back in with her parents to cut down on expenses. At one point, when a customer compliments her on having lost weight, she blurts out: \u201cI\u2019ve not been able to afford food.\u201d\n\nThere is a particular Peep Show feel to Casual Receptionist, with obvious nods to other satirical shows such as Parks & Recreation and Utopia. Loading We witness Gulaksekharam\u2019s activities and gaffes up-close as she interacts with a myriad of invisible people off-stage. Her acting is a delight to witness: she shifts from mirth to disappointment through minute facial expressions and small movements that reveal a latent helplessness and angst. Her comedic timing, too, is incredible. As the show builds up, multimedia and musical elements come together for Gulasekharam to showcase her multiple talents, a true joy to watch. If art is about reflecting the times, Gulasekharam\u2019s show has it all: interrogations about labour and its expectations in this world, delivered in a way that\u2019s engaging, well-paced and non-didactic. The fact that Gulasekharam does indeed have a decade of experience working as a gym receptionist is the icing on the cake \u2013 autofiction, but done live.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Cher Tan\n\nVidya Rajan and Mel McGlensey | Greg\n\nChinese Museum, until April 20 In a festival of nearly 700 shows, it\u2019s fair to assume more than a few of the Gregs in this audience bought their tickets based on the show title alone. There are at least three on this night \u2013 which is exactly what Rajan and McGlensey want. Vidya Rajan (left) and Mel McGlensey idolise Greg at Chinese Museum. The whole pretext of the show is that Gregs are superior humans to be idolised and celebrated. They proceed to list all the laudable qualities in a Greg, and have created a catchy-cute theme song around it. Said Gregs are invited to the stage to either participate or watch from the premium seats to the side of the stage. It\u2019s all delightfully silly and brave and weird. The pair presents as deliberately amateurish but with flashes of brilliance \u2013 like when they face off in a rap battle (purposely misheard as a \u201crat\u201d battle), and Rajan launches into an impressive performance punctuated with the funniest gag of the night.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nHunter Smith | Bushranger\n\nTasma Terrace, until April 20 When Hunter Smith got an alarming text from a former \u201cf--- bestie\u201d, he embarked on a journey that eventually revealed he was a descendant of one of Australia\u2019s most iconic outlaws. He tried not to make it his whole personality \u2014 but failed. Hunter Smith performs Bushranger at Tasma Terrace until April 20. In line with the title, there\u2019s a real Australiana feel to the show. Smith discusses his aversion to the bush and drops cultural references from across the eras, from Harold Holt to Belle Gibson and The Veronicas. He proposes we retaliate against Trump by putting a tariff on Bluey and Nicole Kidman, our two biggest exports to America. The writing is sharp \u2013 unsurprising, given Smith was formerly the head writer on The Project. His casual affability makes you feel like you\u2019re gossiping with a friend, with intrusive thoughts thrown in as ad lib. His Joel Creasey impersonation \u2013 bang on. The room within the Victorian terrace venue is eerily dark, with only fluorescent blue lighting illuminating the room. Whether by design or accident, it adds to the colonial narrative being woven. A how-to on tracing your roots and embracing the unexpected revelations that result.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nSchalk Bezuidenhout | Crowd Pleaser\n\nThe Greek Centre, until April 20 South African comic Schalk Bezuidenhout is a rock star of a performer. So much that he even crowdsurfs over the sold-out audience to the music of Kelly Clarkson. Schalk Bezuidenhout is a Crowd Pleaser at The Greek Centre. On his third visit to Melbourne, Bezuidenhout bursts out of the gates with recollections of his homeland \u2013 be it the stereotypes of crime-riddled neighbourhoods and tales of being carjacked, or how through comedy (Trevor Noah\u2019s stint hosting The Daily Show) and politics (Elon Musk in the White House), South Africa is slowly taking over the world. He delivers one of the finest (and loudest) routines of the festival when speaking about the house he bought in the coastal town of Ballito, a gesture he made to please his wife who would then go on to leave him \u2013 now a dwelling that represents more of a zoo than a home. He even invites a member of the audience to take the mic and deliver any joke of their pleasing. It\u2019s a daring/dangerous move in any environment, but culminates with one of the best callbacks I\u2019ve ever seen at this festival. Crowd Pleaser is a scorching hour of rapid-fire gags and manic energy. Highly recommended.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\n\nThe 35th Annual Great Debate\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, April 12 It\u2019s a testament to the pulling power of the comedy festival\u2019s highly vaunted annual debate that audiences chose to congregate in a majestic dark room instead of enjoying the unseasonably warm day. Desiree Burch argued on the negative team for this year\u2019s Great Debate. The two teams this year squared off against each other to argue for and against the statement \u201cthat social media is good, actually\u201d, which would seem like a somewhat tired premise if it weren\u2019t for the renewed actions of tech oligarchs and Australia\u2019s recently implemented social media ban for children. Hosted by the effervescent Steph Tisdell, whose periodic bouts of wheezing laughter begot a similar response from the crowd, Pierre Novellie (affirmative captain), Jenny Tian and Chris Parker faced off against Alexei Toliopoulos (negative captain), Gillian Cosgriff and Desiree Burch.\n\nNovellie kicked things off strongly by detailing the merits of each social media platform and playing footage of the state of the world before its advent \u2013 taking the debate to a laughably dark place. In what would become an overarching theme of his contributions, Toliopoulos went deep and niche as a certified film guy on the \u201ccinephile registry\u201d, outlining all the ways social media had ruined film-watching and filmmaking. There could be no better proponent for social media than Tian, a viral TikTok sensation whose online popularity has translated into a flourishing stand-up career. She was the first to go combative and personal with customised jabs aimed at each member of the negative team, drawing howls of laughter from an audience fanging for blood. Cosgriff did what she does best and sang about the corrosive effect social media has had on her attention span and ability to get things done. Loading Parker evoked the power of community that social media brought him as a gay closeted teen. The positive team drew on an arsenal of supporters \u2013 conservationists in Tian\u2019s case, firefighters in Parker\u2019s \u2013 to further underline the revolutionary power of social media. As perhaps the only Gen Xer in either team, Burch brought things home with a passionate manifesto that had more soundbites than one could count. Channelling an ominous Marvel villain in his pointed rebuttal, Novellie expertly denounced each of the three negative debaters\u2019 points, but Toliopoulos countered that by running headfirst into the continuation of an utterly mad and lengthy anecdote about minions, pronounced mignon (you had to be there). Despite the lack of effective rebuttal from the negative team, they won \u2013 though as Parker pointed out, it wouldn\u2019t stop anyone from doom-scrolling once they got home.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nChloe Petts | How You See Me, How You Don\u2019t\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 20 Petts is riding the waves of success on the main stage, with spots on this festival\u2019s gala and, back home in England, a Saturday morning TV sports show. Which is how the self-described \u201cradical feminist queer\u201d (who also happens to be a \u201cfootball lad\u201d) wound up with her first lot of social media trolls. Chloe Petts performs How You See Me, How You Don\u2019t at Melbourne Town Hall. In previous shows, Petts has used her apparent juxtapositions in identity to disarm and dismantle prejudices against the queer community. This hour is more personal. We go back to her school days in Kent and imagine a young Petts in context: school captain, oblivious to her own sexuality and impervious to bullying. This becomes unexpectedly meta on Saturday night as an inebriated second row threatens to derail the show, and one audience member suggests they could leave. Petts is quick to defuse with her brilliant and ever-agile crowd work, and we witness what she\u2019s already told us: be it hecklers or trolls, she needs no one to protect her.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nSofie Hagen | Banglord\n\nThe Greek \u2013 Gallery, until April 20 There\u2019s no time to be wasted on needless introductions and crowd work in Danish comedian and podcaster Sofie Hagen\u2019s show. A natural raconteur with a gentle air of self-deprecation, Hagen immediately disarms audiences with a joke about her smartwatch before launching into a memorable hour of humorous soliloquies. Sofie Hagen performs Banglord at The Greek until April 20. The throughline of Banglord is the fact that Hagen hasn\u2019t had sex in a very long time. She decides to meet with a sexologist, who turns out to be someone quite different to who she envisioned. Hagen oscillates between recounting this story and meandering into entertaining tangents about being a queer, non-binary, fat person. When presented with a close friend\u2019s admission that she\u2019s bisexual, Hagen weaves an extended hypothetical about living with a wife that becomes more uproarious the longer she persists with it. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to refer to me by \u2018they\u2019 and be proud of themselves,\u201d she says in a bit admonishing those who feel a disproportionate sense of pride in getting people\u2019s pronouns right while elucidating her own. Countering the fatphobia that remains prevalent in comedy, Hagen takes aim at people who insist she\u2019s \u201cnot fat\u201d but beautiful, skinny people, chairs ill-equipped to accommodate bigger bodies. It\u2019s refreshing to be in a room erupting in laughter at a person punching up towards the institutions that belittle them when the opposite is still far too common.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nRhys Darby | The Legend Returns\n\nThe Athanaeum, until April 13 From robots to rocketships and Rubik\u2019s cubes, this slick hour of comedy bursts at the seams with the accoutrements of humanity\u2019s aspirations. We created them, we don\u2019t understand them and, Darby suggests, we likely can\u2019t control them \u2013 the AI horse has already bolted. Rhys Darby is The Legend Returns at The Athenaeum. For many comedians, an observation would stop there but Darby goes the extra step every time, physically committing to each bit and character \u2013 even as the metaphors grow extra metaphors, like AI horses with too many limbs. A line about saying things you shouldn\u2019t turns into an elaborate escapade where his thoughts boldly venture from the brain to the vocal cords. We revisit the \u2018hoverboards\u2019 of last decade and explore what school drop-off might look like using drones. Some of these are amusing sidebars while others loop back as clever set-ups in a wildly imaginative sci-fi-comedy narrative. The Tesla Cybertruck and dancing Roomba vacuum cleaner impressions are gold.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Hannah Francis\n\nAhir Shah | Ends\n\nThe Westin \u2013 One, until April 20 British-Indian comic Ahir Shah isn\u2019t your average stand-up. His routines characteristically wade into dark and difficult material \u2013 mental health and mortality in Duffer, the rise of authoritarianism in Control \u2013 but there\u2019s a tinge of something different this time. Shah has found love and refuses to be anything other than \u201cstaggeringly na\u00efve\u201d, even as the UK devolves into a place \u201ccalling its last drinks\u201d. Ahir Shah performs Ends at The Westin until April 20. Speaking at a frenetic pace, spurting out more words in a minute than most people are capable of in 10, Shah warms the audience up with punchlines about his name, learning Latin, and arranged marriages. It\u2019s but a mere prelude to his central preoccupation: the privilege to \u201cgo without saying\u201d as a person of colour in the UK, which Rishi Sunak\u2019s appointment as prime minister heralded, and the generational progress that\u2019s unfolded since Shah\u2019s n\u0101n\u0101j\u012b migrated to London in 1964. The laughs evaporate as Shah moves into the emotional terrain of unacknowledged sacrifice, the dislocation of migration and the sheer dehumanisation of racism. But he\u2019s a consummate performer, always holding the tension of the room in the palm of his hand as he oscillates between passionate raving orations and punchlines designed to dispel the pressure cooker atmosphere of the room. Whether you believe or not in the merits of representation politics, Shah poetically and resoundingly argues that 2025 would\u2019ve appeared positively utopian to his n\u0101n\u0101j\u012b. If you\u2019re closer to tears than you thought you\u2019d be, it\u2019s proof of Shah\u2019s skilled extrapolation between the personal and the political.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nOlga Koch | Came From Money\n\nMelbourne Town Hall, until April 20 A show that centres on your own affluence, at a festival where many performers are destined to incur a financial loss, in the time of a cost-of-living crisis? It\u2019s a bold move \u2013 but Olga Koch circumnavigates the awkwardness of checking her own privilege ingeniously. Olga Koch Came From Money plays at Melbourne Town Hall until April 20. The Russian-born comic was born into unfathomable wealth due to her father \u2013 the once-deputy prime minister of Boris Yeltsin \u2013 who was a benefactor from when the riches during the collapse of the Soviet Union were divided. A wealth not one that Koch took for granted, but politely declined to receive furthermore from her family in her early 20s. Came From Money is a piercing skewer of capitalism, socialism, oligarchies, class divides, and how we are defined by our bank balances. Koch\u2019s ability to heel-turn from economic inequality into societal critiques and observations is superb, be it a borderline disgusting comparison of the fall of the Berlin Wall to the female reproductive system, call-backs, or impeccable crowd work. She ends with a line I\u2019m sure her promoters must hate: \u201cIf you know someone who wants to see the show but can\u2019t afford it, just get them to message me \u2013 I don\u2019t want someone not to be able to see a show about money because of money.\u201d It\u2019s an ode to the ideology that money should never be a barrier to life in a perfect world \u2013 or at least a damn good comedy show.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\n\nNish Kumar | Nish, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe\n\nArts Centre Melbourne, until April 20 British comedian Nish Kumar barely utters a breath as he delivers his politically imbued, rage-fuelled set at pace. He argues that Rishi Sunak and Usha Vance don\u2019t represent his ideals despite their shared Indian heritage. Nish Kumar in Nish, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe, at Arts Centre Melbourne. There\u2019s a false start as his walk-on music plays prematurely: an altered version of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Bitch, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe, which inspired the show\u2019s name. He sheepishly confesses he was busy eating an orange and using the bathroom at the time. The pre-election timing of Kumar\u2019s show is fortuitous. The first half draws humorous comparisons between UK, US and Australian politicians and their policies, encouraging the audience to use their upcoming vote wisely. The second half is a notable shift towards personal observations, revealing his battles with anxiety and its origins. The intended 70-minute set runs for just under two hours. He promises to rectify this for future shows, graciously creating an opportunity for audiences to exit if need be. An intelligent jokester with a moral vendetta.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nCon Coutis | Escape from Heck Island\n\nMalthouse \u2013 Playbox, until April 20 Armed with an impish grin and decked out in a boilersuit, Con Coutis is the \u201ccorrectional system\u2019s favourite comedian\u201d. But what happens when a case of mistaken identity results in Coutis becoming a prisoner himself? Con Coutis tries to Escape from Heck Island at The Malthouse. With over an hour of immaculately incorporated pre-recorded audiovisual cues, audiences are plunged into the immersive world of Heck Island where different cliques rule the roost and a certain iteration of MasterChef holds the key to Coutis\u2019 escape. Incarcerated alongside Coutis, the audience \u2013 and therefore audience participation, albeit of the most unthreatening kind \u2013 is a big part of the show. It\u2019s testament to Coutis\u2019 easy affability that not even an unco-operative audience member in the front row throws him off. Escape from Heck Island is a clever show that seamlessly melds multimedia components with live interactions \u2013 culminating in something that feels dynamic, vibrant and open to the vagaries of possibility. There\u2019s a healthy dose of misdirection in the way Coutis constantly subverts expectations while obscuring his working. Simultaneously interrogating the social contract between audience and comedian while acting in an ensemble cast where he\u2019s the only onstage performer, Coutis has assembled an exceedingly well-crafted hour of throwbacks, cultural references and suspended disbelief.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nPaul Foot | Dissolve\n\nArts Centre Melbourne, until April 20 With his feral pixie coiffure and signature pigeon strut, Paul Foot has always cultivated an air of pompous buffoonery. He\u2019s a clever guy, but also a ridiculous Englishman yelling absurdities, and retains a clownish aspect even when getting serious. Which, surprisingly, he does this year. Paul Foot performs Dissolve at Arts Centre Melbourne until April 20. Fans will be treated to some of the familiar absurdities \u2013 ancient Egyptian teen dramas, pop singers on the battlefield \u2013 but they\u2019ll also learn about his decades-long struggle with depression, the childhood trauma behind it and the three seconds in which it was resolved. It\u2019s a shock to anyone expecting his usual semi-surreal rants, but the way Foot treads so lightly around these hard issues is truly enigmatic. He\u2019s built a show around crippling emotional wounds that just ... got better? There\u2019s power in the way he refuses to turn his inner life into a vehicle for audience catharsis, but taking us to challenging places and then turning out the lights is a courageous yet bizarre comic choice.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by John Bailey\n\nAlex Hines | Girl Culture\n\nThe Malthouse \u2013 The Tower, until April 20 If you didn\u2019t have an entire audience yelling out \u201cOne Nation\u201d on your comedy festival bingo card, you may not be familiar with the work of absurdist sketch comedian Alex Hines. Alex Hines\u2019 Girl Culture is on at The Malthouse until April 20. The infamous Pauline Hanson features three times in Hines\u2019 introductory song for Girl Culture, each time funnier than the last. Her lyrics run the gamut from explaining what girl culture is \u2013 from hair extensions to neurodivergence to womanly excretions \u2013 and highlighting both the pervasiveness and inanity underpinning girlhood\u2019s latest resurgence in pop culture. Girl Culture is an hour of disparate fantastical sketches that have either tenuous or no connections to the central conceit. Aided by slides, Hines is a versatile performer who does superb character work \u2013 she can switch seamlessly between pathos and levity, inhabit different personas at the drop of a (literal) hat, and assume distinctive accents with aplomb. There are many costume and wig changes, and even more shifts in tone and subject matter, which can be discombobulating. Some sketches are stronger than others. Highlights include a soft-drink competition where Hines is a Diet Coke songstress, and a surreal sequence where Hines becomes her great-aunt, a Midwestern woman who lost her head in a hurricane. You\u2019ll never know what\u2019s coming next, but strap yourselves in for a rollercoaster ride around the recesses of Hines\u2019 mind.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nAnna Dooley | Endhoe\n\nQueen Victoria Women\u2019s Centre, until April 19 Endo\u2019s no joke. Frequently listed as one of the 20 most painful diseases of the human body, tonight she is personified by comedian and actor Anna Dooley. Endo takes centre stage after being promoted to CEO of Dooley\u2019s nervous system. She\u2019s a powerful CEO giving a rousing presentation to the other organs and nerves of Dooley\u2019s body. Anna Dooley performs Endhoe at The Malthouse until April 20. Facing down a variety of foes from home-brand f-boys to painkillers and doctors, she\u2019s running the show right here in front of us. Tales of hijacking her host-body\u2019s attempts to work, socialise or otherwise live life connect with the audience, eliciting knowing laughter and groans of familiarity. Highlights included a vigorous pain-scale workout/dance routine as Endo works on her crescendo of pain rising from one up to 10. Dooley has taken a sadly common experience that isn\u2019t acknowledged enough in medicine or society and found a way to make it funny: no joke.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Lefa Singleton Norton\n\nKevin Han | Extremely Tall and Incredibly Chinese\n\nStoryville, until April 20 Up-and-coming comic Kevin Han has a new show and its title can be taken literally. He is Extremely Tall and Incredibly Chinese. On the night I go, it could be that the crowd was too awkward or sober, but Han is quick on his feet and isn\u2019t deterred. Halfway through the show, the lights suddenly go off, but Han\u2019s quick-wittedness makes me think it is part of the performance. It was a true accident. Kevin Han is Extremely Tall and Incredibly Chinese at Storyville until April 20. Not everything is completely refined. But it is his second night. Jokes are targeted at an Australian audience, often delivered in surprising ways \u2013 his material moves from the relationship between Vietnamese and Lebanese people in western Sydney where Han grew up, to mixed-race relationships, Streets ice cream, and white Australian farmers. \u201cThere are racial jokes and there are racist jokes,\u201d Han explains about two-thirds into the show. It\u2019s true, and he\u2019s a master of the former \u2013 his work teeters on the edge of tipping into offence but never does, and often offers \u200bremarkable punchlines. At one point, Han admits that comedy is hard. He\u2019s not wrong: it requires much attention to detail while juggling multiple creative skills to deliver a show that looks effortless. A comic worth keeping an eye on.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Cher Tan\n\nNick Robertson | Everything that happened at Number 68\n\nChinese Museum \u2013 Tea Room until April 20 Do not be concerned if your phone battery is running low, Nick Robertson has a charger at the ready. He also serves cups of tea in mismatched mugs and offers cushions for extra seat comfort as you settle in. Nick Robertson outlines Everything That Happened at Number 68 at Chinese Museum until April 20. Robertson loves telling stories and it shows. With an excited glint in his eyes, and an endearing grin, he relays share house adventures. Eventualities that surface as he sifts through his barrage of memories from his early 20s (not that long ago) include an epic house party, living with an eclectic bunch of housemates and surviving an intense landlord. Robertson\u2019s exemplary knack of telling amusing tales shines through with references to yoga, footy and an adorable pet bunny. Finding out how the house ends up with a Soda Stream is a stand-out moment. There are occasional word stumbles peppering an otherwise engagingly executed performance. All in all, it\u2019s a fascinating hour of mirth and memories.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Donna Demaio\n\nUrooj Ashfaq | It\u2019s Funny To Me\n\nMelbourne Town Hall \u2013 Powder Room, until April 20 Urooj Ashfaq is on a mission to deliver a sexy, dirty, edgy show \u2013 mostly to disprove a British critic who called her \u201cconservative\u201d. The miniskirt is part of it, as are smutty double entendres about reading erotica and being the first woman in her family to be diagnosed with haemorrhoids. Urooj Ashfaq\u2019s It\u2019s Funny To Me plays at Melbourne Town Hall until April 20. The show is strong on crowd work, though it\u2019s mostly utilised to implore embarrassed young South Asian men to maintain eye contact with her when she\u2019s talking about sex \u2013 to great comedic effect. She\u2019s nimble in responding to her surroundings, garnering some of the loudest laughs as she remarks on a passing ambulance. Ashfaq is at her strongest when she\u2019s delivering darkly funny throwaway lines that belie her persona as a fresh-faced ingenue, whether it\u2019s about living as a Muslim Indian woman in the Subcontinent or why being grounded doesn\u2019t make cultural sense as a punishment. There are two extended bits in her routine: one about her exploits as an ill-disciplined high school student, the other drawing on a piece of One Direction fan fiction. They\u2019re amusing at the offset, but perhaps mined beyond their comedic potential by the end. On the back of Ashfaq\u2019s award-winning 2023 debut show, Oh No!, It\u2019s Funny to Me is a solid set that veers towards the expected with moments of brilliance.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Sonia Nair\n\nBubble Laboratory | Bubble Show in Space\n\nMelbourne Museum, until April 20 Eccentric duo Dr Bubble and Milkshake take children on a high energy, sudsy adventure through space. The show is filled with non-stop mayhem, incorporating shadow and hand puppets, slapstick comedy and high-stakes bubble tricks. There\u2019s audience participation as kids are invited on stage as \u201caliens\u201d to engage in the foamy fun. Dr Bubble and Milkshake in the Bubble Show in Space, at Melbourne Museum until April 20. As a parent, it might feel chaotic and the space storyline a little tenuous. However, constructing an almost hour-long, all-ages show with enough variety to keep kids entertained is no mean feat. Even when the stunts go awry, the entertainers do well to stall, restart and keep the show going. It\u2019s a joy to watch young audiences gasp in awe as the pair create a giant bubble that snakes around the stage or giggle as Milkshake and Dr Bubble play tricks on each other. It eventually descends into carnage as bubbles fill the theatre and kids race towards the stage to immerse themselves in it all.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nTaylor Griffiths | Sublime Avenue\n\nTheory Bar, until April 20 It\u2019s never a good sign when the biggest laughs in the room are coming from your own tech person. Taylor Griffiths is a mainstay on the sketch and improv scene around Melbourne, and it\u2019s clear where she gets her influences from. But unlike the utter commitment to the bit of Hannah Camilleri, or the audacious and ridiculous characters of Nat Harris, her act is poorly structured and centres on cookie-cutter depictions with clumsy delivery. Taylor Griffiths on Sublime Avenue. She performs at Theory Bar until April 20. A sketch portraying a Metricon Homes sales pitch well outstays it\u2019s welcome, before returning again \u2026 and again. A boorish construction supervisor berates his fellow tradies with a bro-first mentality. There is little creativity and individuality within the characters that live on the titular avenue \u2013 worse, many of them are accompanied by D-grade jokes. Griffiths is no doubt trying to channel the bogan-chic of Kath & Kim, but the finesse and slick writing that made Fountain Lakes shine is in another stratosphere. There are bones of a decent sketch show here \u2013 but little else.\n\n\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Tyson Wray\n\nSharam Namdarian | From Brunswick with Love\n\nDoubleTree Hilton, until April 20 Not every stand-up show needs to push the boundaries of comedy, but sticking to a tried-and-true formula can work against an artist \u2013 familiarity begets a certain colourlessness. Sharam Namdarian is From Brunswick with Love and plays at DoubleTree by Hilton. Sharam Namdarian\u2019s latest show, From Brunswick with Love, is a bit like that \u2013 it may be that he\u2019s used to radio and TV formats, having appeared on triple J and Channel Seven. It isn\u2019t really about Brunswick either. But that\u2019s fine: the label on the tin doesn\u2019t necessarily need to match what\u2019s inside. He moves swiftly between bits, and reveals, as mentioned in the show\u2019s synopsis, that he used to be a \u201crelationship coach\u201d. Yet that\u2019s the joke and the punchline \u2013 we never get to hear much more about it. So, toxic masculinity: tick; being mistaken as white as a light-skinned person of colour: tick; \u201cthe ethnic voice\u201d: tick; artificial intelligence and apps: tick; \u201cthis modern life\u201d: tick; \u201cnot seeing colour: tick. Namdarian is not entirely unfunny, but the material isn\u2019t particularly refreshing. There\u2019s a feeling of having seen this before; there are only so many ways to rehash a joke.\n\n\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by Cher Tan",

MUSIC\n\nBach, Stravinsky & Spohr\n\nSydney Symphony Fellows in Concert\n\nSydney Opera House, April 11\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd This concert by the Sydney Symphony Fellows and their mentors began with a supreme masterpiece of the 18th-century concerto grosso genre, Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G. It continued with the same genre just over 200 years later, as seen through the 20th-century\u2019s neo-classical distorting lens in Stravinsky\u2019s Concerto in E flat, Dumbarton Oaks.\n\nIn the outer movements of the Bach, confidently led by violinist Natalie Mavridis (with SSO associate concertmaster Alexandre Osborne and harpsichordist Thomas Wilson), the nine concertante string players (three each of violins, violas and cellos) exchanged motifs with buoyant momentum, switching between solo, trio and accompaniment roles as Bach continuously regroups the players in a joyous variety of combinations. By the time Stravinsky revisited this style, its characteristic ideas had stiffened into convention and recycling them unadjusted was no longer an option. Although the opening theme of Dumbarton Oaks (led by Liam Pilgrim) has passing similarity to ideas in Bach\u2019s first movement, Stravinsky clips the rhythm unpredictably and makes the harmonies collide as though cut up and rearranged in a cubist painting. The Fellows\u2019 performance, under conductor Tim Constable (percussionist for the SSO) was generally tight in the unpredictable metres of the outer movements, and persuasive in the second where Stravinsky specifies intricately specific articulation (some motives could have been chiselled more insistently). In the arrangements for brass quintet of four pieces from Monteverdi\u2019s Fourth Book of Madrigals which followed, the challenge was to rediscover the natural melodic shape of lines written for the voice with modern brass instruments. Using flugelhorns for the upper parts in the slow languorous madrigals and trumpets for the march-like faster ones, the brass quintet (with SSO player Brent Grapes as mentor), produced smooth euphony and warm balance, spiced with strings of dissonant suspensions. The final work, Louis Spohr\u2019s Grand Nonet in F major, Opus 31 (1813) uses one each of the four string instruments, and one each of the woodwind plus horn, and is full of amiable ideas, conceived more for salon than concert hall. The string sound was less strongly projected than the woodwind, but the Fellows maintained musical geniality through close listening and carefully matched nuance.\n\nMUSIC\n\nLumen Machine\n\nEnsemble Offspring\n\nThe Nielson, ACO on the Pier. April 12\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe first concert of Ensemble Offspring\u2019s 30th anniversary year foregrounded digital technology as a tool of musical extension, creation and transformation. Digital technology pervades much of today\u2019s musical world (even when you don\u2019t want it to), and is not the new frontier it was in the 1980s when works such as Pierre Boulez\u2019s Repons opened a new world of live performance possibilities. Ensemble Offspring\u2019s Claire Edwardes. This program was notable for its energy and variety as much as for its neat new devices. The first work, Weight and Load #2, by German composer Brigitta Muntendorf, was of interest as much for what it wasn\u2019t as for what it was. Eschewing conventional concepts of musical grace and beauty in both classical and popular spheres, it began with a bludgeoning beat across all instruments including a \u201cvirtual piano\u201d played in the air by pianist Zubin Kanga in which sensors translated hand gestures to sounds. When melodic motifs appeared, they were mechanical and emotionally empty, with an expression of denial reminiscent of Lucky\u2019s dance in Waiting for Godot. Kanga\u2019s own work From the Machine (after Eastman) drew on the work of singer and composer Julius Eastman (notable for his recording of Peter Maxwell Davies\u2019 Eight Songs for a Mad King).\n\nKanga blended scales and timbres at the synthesiser, waving a Genki Wave ring on his finger to change echo and resonance, somewhat like the distortions of a \u201cwobble board\u201d. Amanda Cole\u2019s Dream Garden introduced the fresh intervals and chords of just intonation, based on the natural harmonic series rather than the compromises usually made in modern scales and keys. Instrumental players adjusted the pitch of notes to those played by Kanga on a Lumatone keyboard (slightly over-dominant in the sound mix) to produce serene and tranquil textures over four movements, Unfurling, Insects, Rain, and Rainbows. Anna Meredith\u2019s Bumps Per Minute celebrated the crass hyperactivity of popular digital styles unashamedly. Its four movements were an arrangement for electronics, keyboard (Kanga) and vibraphone (Ensemble Offspring director Claire Edwardes) by Jessica Wells of short pieces Meredith originally wrote for an art installation in which the collisions of dodgem cars triggered outbursts of digitised music. Tristan Coelho\u2019s Hot Take offered a comment on the crassness and superficiality of modern discourse and resonated with Muntendorf\u2019s piece in both sound and idea. It began with brash musical gestures thrown out wave upon wave by the players, with barking repetitions from bass clarinet and cello, arpeggios on the piano and emphatic thuds from vibraphone and bass drum. The resonance hovered around the ensemble and was again controlled by Kanga with the Genki Wave ring so that it redoubled and turned in on itself. Melodic ideas fitfully tried to break through and eventually established a quieter phase on solo violin (Veronique Serret) suggesting more authentic musical reflection. The bass clarinet tried to revive the earlier raucousness but its energy was spent.\n\nMUSIC\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nQudos Bank Arena, April 8\n\nReviewed by JAMES JENNINGS\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nCyndi Lauper\u2019s life has been more colourful life than most, a fact underlined by an MTV-style montage that kicks off the Sydney leg of her farewell tour. It\u2019s all there: the bold \u201980s fashions and multicoloured hair, the global hits, the vibrant music videos, the campaigning for LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights. They\u2019re all crucial elements of Lauper\u2019s enduring appeal, but her distinct, four-octave vocal range and ability to belt out a song like every cell in her body is vibrating has always impressed the most. It\u2019s a thrill to hear it in action on \u201980s classics like The Goonies \u2018R\u2019 Good Enough and She Bop, which deliver a potent nostalgia hit for the crowd, many of whom are decked out in fluoro wigs and fishnet stockings. Cyndi Lauper performs as if every cell in her body is vibrating. Credit: Martin Philbey\n\nAfter the sugar rush opening, Lauper takes the first of many breaks to talk to the audience. By the time the gig is done, there will be about as much chatting as tunes. While that might be a major strike for most artists, it\u2019s a positive for Lauper, who is equal parts charming and funny, regaling us with engaging tales about her life in her distinct Noo Yawk accent. There\u2019s a roughly chronological run of songs from throughout Lauper\u2019s career, including some choice covers that show off her range and ability to traverse genres: a Mardi Gras in New Orleans-invoking Iko Iko; Wanda Jackson\u2019s country-rock classic Funnel of Love; and Frankie Laine\u2019s I\u2019m Gonna Be Strong. While there are a few occasions when Lauper, understandably, doesn\u2019t quite hit the high notes like she used to, there are still plenty of moments where she does, like on a thrilling version of Money Changes Everything and chill-inducing Time After Time, which may be the best song of the night. Yes, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun is saved for last and it\u2019s still a blast to hear 42 years later, but True Colours best encapsulates Lauper\u2019s spirit. In a show full of striking set design, the image of Lauper singing what has become a gay anthem, with a fan-blown rainbow scarf dancing above her, is both iconic and poignant, and a perfect example of an artist who\u2019s always poured her heart into her art. If it really is the final time Lauper plays live in Sydney, it\u2019s a wonderful way to go out.\n\nTHEATRE\n\nBIG GIRLS DON\u2019T CRY\n\nBelvoir St Theatre, April 9\n\nUntil April 27\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd I\u2019m sure Megan Wilding doesn\u2019t mean to steal scenes, but her physical acting, timing and control of her vocal pitch are so complete she\u2019s a magnet for the eyes and ears. Even with very fine actors, you sometimes see the craft underpinning their art. With Wilding, you just see the character she plays, and laugh at every jot of comedy this character conveys. In Dalara Williams\u2019 Big Girls Don\u2019t Cry, here having its world premiere directed by Ian Michael, Wilding plays Queenie, the most rambunctious of three young black women living in Redfern in the mid-1960s. Her friends are Cheryl (played by Williams, herself) and Lulu (an amusing Stephanie Somerville), and their camaraderie is a bulwark against the racism that pervades their daily lives. Megan Wilding (left) with Stephanie Somerville. Credit: Stephen Wilson Barker\n\nWilliams draws on stories she was told by women who lived through this era, and references the 1964 establishment of the Foundation of Aboriginal Affairs, the 1965 Freedom Ride confronting racism in New South Wales towns, and the run-up to the 1967 referendum that saw Aboriginal people finally included in the population. Vietnam is there, with Cheryl\u2019s boyfriend, Michael (Mathew Cooper) writing to her from the war, and 60s-style pop music (by Brendan Boney) sprays the air, hence the titular reference to The Four Seasons\u2019 1962 hit. Yet, despite the bigotry experienced by the women and Cheryl\u2019s brother Ernie (Guy Simon), notably at the hands of a local cop (Bryn Chapman Parish), the play spends most of its time riding on a rare lightness of humour. Williams shoots for neither raucous laughs nor laboured satire, but a gentle comedy of manners, interwoven with conflicting love stories, primarily with Cheryl falling for Ernie\u2019s friend Milo (Nic English) while Michael\u2019s away. Ernie, who bears the physical brunt of the racism, is proudly defiant, gleefully explaining to Milo that Australia\u2019s whites are bizarrely loyal to the same crown that kicked their own ancestors out of Great Britain. When he\u2019s arrested for little more than breathing, and Queenie\u2019s fired for being late for work, the play darkens. Here, however, Williams becomes less assured. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my job, but I\u2019m not ready to lose my dignity,\u201d Queenie declares, and even Wilding can\u2019t save the line. Chapman Parish (who later is highly amusing as Lulu\u2019s deferential date) has only a shrill white supremacist to work with as the cop, and the increased drama somehow doesn\u2019t equate to increased tension. The problem is compounded when the second half of the three-hour play begins with Cheryl enunciating the debilitating effects of racism, as if Williams has shrugged off her character, and is addressing us as the playwright. The information was already implicit. After this lapse, she steers her play back to the earlier deftness of tone, notably in a scene between Ernie and Queenie on a park bench, with Simon perfectly catching Ernie\u2019s awkwardness, while succeeding emotions play across Wilding\u2019s face.\n\nMozart & Bruckner\n\nSydney Symphony Orchestra\n\nSydney Opera House, April 9\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The opening work, Kate Moore\u2019s Blue Light Sphere, began suddenly with an energised texture of plucked notes and pulsating repetitions on percussion, all embellishing a single chord. That chord ended up being sustained for the entire eight-minute piece, and the combination of intense micro-activity within harmonic stasis conveyed a sense of swirling movement within a context of equilibrium. Denying herself the resource of harmonic movement, Moore relied on modal inflection, shifts in orchestration and texture, and irregular rhythmic impulses. Sometimes a line would momentarily be highlighted with iridescence before receding into the surrounding motion like a rotating object in space catching a distant light. The strategy of building a piece on a single harmony with varied orchestration is akin to that used by Schoenberg in his orchestral piece Farben, but the effect here was of a more vivid sense of presence within a state of transcendence.\n\nTo fill up the short first half, Lise de la Salle then played Mozart\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 19 in F, K. 459 with pert brilliance and vivacity. De la Salle maintained a strongly projected, marble-edged sound that favoured the piano, though sometimes at the expense of woodwind detail (for example, in the first movement). She drove the finale with insistence and brisk pianistic competence. In Bruckner\u2019s Symphony No. 7 in the second half, the music shifted gear, to ideas that unfolded over paragraphs rather than phrases. Conductor Lawrence Renes subdued the violins at the start to a hushed murmur while the cellos and horn unfolded the broad opening theme with carefully nuanced gradations, growing in grandeur and magnificence with repetition. At the close of that movement, the horns recalled that moment with a sound of sun-drenched warmth. The transition from that moment to the darker, premonitory sound of the so-called \u201cWagner tubas\u201d (sitting just behind the horns) who, with violas, play the first theme of the second movement, is like watching that sun-drenched object change mood as the sun becomes cloud-covered. Bruckner said the theme came to his mind just as he realised that the ageing Wagner, whom he had just met in Bayreuth, might shortly die, and Renes allowed its structure to unfold at its own majestic pace without dragging to a point of climactic culmination. For the third movement, Renes and the orchestra established an effective tempo of incisive vigour enlivened by crisp articulation, and moved to the fourth movement without a break (thus heading off distracting applause). Transparently balanced woodwind clarity, glowing strength from the brass and furious intensity from the strings all gave Bruckner\u2019s expansive, sometimes surprising finale rewarding cogency and impact.\n\nMUSIC\n\nSex Pistols\n\nHordern Pavilion, April 8\n\nReviewed by GEORGE PALATHINGAL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 We\u2019ve just heard three of his heroes tear through a seething Pretty Vacant, with Frank Carter himself getting to live his dreams and gleefully sneer and snarl his way through it with both them and an ecstatic crowd - but the fill-in frontman is not happy. Carter, a slight but ferocious cult hero of 21st-century Brit punk (former bands: Gallows, Pure Love, Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes), has on this tour been given the mammoth task of replacing John \u201cJohnny Rotten\u201d Lydon alongside original Pistols Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook. He\u2019s not quite as unhappy as the uninvited Lydon, but Carter nonetheless berates us for booing Jones\u2019 talk of the crowds in Adelaide and Melbourne being better. So he takes matters into his own hands, wades into the crowd, gets a sizeable circle-pit going and howls Bodies from it.\n\nThis Sex Pistols tour is way more exciting than it has any right to be. Credit: Martin Philbey It\u2019s a magnificent moment in a gig that\u2019s far more exciting than it has any right to be, but it\u2019s not our fault there\u2019s limited atmosphere for most of it. Curtains are hiding most of the chairs up the sides of the Hordern and the room is perhaps half-full at best. So while the band, and those who turned up, do everything they can to tear off the roof, there simply isn\u2019t enough energy to do so. Still, these Pistols are firing. They play in full, but not in order, their only proper album, Never Mind the Bollocks, and while obviously not having the culture-shattering impact it had on its 1977 release, it still thrills relentlessly, largely thanks to Jones\u2019 scorching riffs and Carter\u2019s energy and vocals \u2013 the latter adding to a superlative approximation of these past glories rather than being a flat-out imitation of Rotten memories. And on the subject of handy stage names, mercifully there\u2019s little Vicious about this night\u2019s take on My Way, as stupidly warbled by Sid in The Great Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Swindle, which Carter sings quite sweetly before it kicks off after its first chorus.",

    "text": "Gutter guards sound like they protect homes from leaves and debris build-up, but often they can be counterintuitive.\n\nGutter guards are a popular feature on roofs around the country, with many homeowners installing the devices in a bid to keep things neat and tidy, and free of debris.\n\nBut, some \"people might not know\" they can actually create more harm the good, and may even end up costing homeowners more in the long run. This week, a business owner spotted thousands of leaves built up on an Aussie roof with gutter guards.\n\nSydney gardener and landscaper Nathan Stafford has often urged homeowners to think twice before having them installed. Speaking to Yahoo News, he said because gutter guards are commonly bolted down with \"hundreds of nails\", it's extremely difficult to remove the build-up from beneath them, which he said still occurs despite the whole point of the gutter guard being to prevent just that.\n\nSince they make it harder to see inside the gutter, problems like blockages, rust, or mould can go unnoticed until there\u2019s an overflow or damage. And when it's finally time to clean them, they can make the job trickier and more time-consuming than if the gutter had been left open.\n\nSentiment falls through mesh gutter guards and results in a heavy mud-like substance forming beneath, in addition to moss. Source: TikTok/biglux7\n\nWhy might gutter guards not work for everyone?\n\nNathan said he's simply not a fan. \"I've been maintaining homes for over 15 years and I've done thousands of gutter cleaning jobs,\" he earlier told Yahoo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"What happens is, you get them installed and a lot of people think 'well, that's it'. But things fall on top of them, and they have little holes, so over time, the matter breaks down and falls in.\"\n\n\"Then it turns into a soil-like substance, and it's very hard. Add a bit of rain to it and it becomes mud, and it starts pulling on the gutters, which impacts the fascia of the roof.\"\n\nNathan said in recent times he's noticed gutter guards appearing \"more and more\". He said often, in his experience, homeowners are having to call in professionals to clean their gutters, which become even more clogged with the guards in place than if they weren't.\n\nMarc Plowman is the business owner of an alternative guttering product, Flowmate. He's one of the professionals who often gets the call to address gutters that can fill with leaves. While installing his product for a client, he noticed a neighbour's property with gutter guards and highlighted the leaves building up on the roof in a video.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Unfortunately, a lot of the time, consumers aren't told that they still need to maintain their gutters,\" he said. \"Gutter guards are very costly; for example, gutter cleaning on a standard house would generally be about $350 even after a gutter guard is installed.\n\n\"This debris that's left on top decomposes and goes down into the gaps themselves. It creates a little ecosystem in there to grow. A lot of this is not always told to clients when they're sold, and people invest thousands into getting them put on and then wonder why they've got a problem.\"\n\nWhile gutter guards are certainly not a \"set-and-forget\" product, they might still reduce the frequency and severity of cleaning somewhat, especially for homes with dense leaf coverage.\n\nBut Marc who sells the Flowmate gutter system said, around 25 to 30 per cent of his weekly jobs involve issues with gutter guards, with many requiring them to be removed or cleaned out. Once removed, he added, any product warranty is usually voided.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "After living in Australia for a few months, the young woman said the issue is \"a lot worse here\". What do you think?\n\nThe British woman living on the Gold Coast has forced an uncomfortable conversation about Australians. Source: TikTok/eloise_juliet\n\nA young expat living and studying in Australia has responded to a media firestorm after causing a stir by declaring the country has a \"dark\" problem that is \"worse\" than other cultures she's experienced.\n\nDespite ruffling some feather with her claim about the \"unspoken dark side\" of Australia, the young British woman said she still loves the country, \"even if you don\u2019t love me anymore\".\n\nEloise Juliet drew attention with her observation about people Down Under, describing a lack of emotional availability as \"a very Australian-specific issue\". The woman, who is living on the Gold Coast, argued that it stemmed from a prevalence of misogyny in Aussie society and that men generally act \"strangely towards women\" and \"treat them like objects\".\n\n\"It's just a lot worse here,\" she claimed in the clip that has been watched more than half a million times.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNoting the media attention on Friday, she said it would be the last time she addressed the issue but explained she was just trying to get her observation out there and \"make other people who have had that same experience as me, feel less alone\".\n\n\"And maybe just spark some conversation among people about why this is happening and what we could do about it,\" she added.\n\n\"Australia I still love you even if you don\u2019t love me anymore,\" she captioned the video on TikTok.\n\nWhile Eloise did not respond to Yahoo's request for further comment, she has remained outspoken in recent days, and indeed sparked the conversation she was hoping for.\n\n\"Your video made me feel very heard,\" one follower commented overnight. \"Moved to the Gold Coast last September at 18, and also go to university here but moving back to England in June,\" they wrote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn her original video, there was a mixed reaction with some Aussies critical of her take, while others thought it might have been down to a misunderstanding on her part. However plenty of others agreed there is a \"sharp divide between the sexes\" and a lack of emotional vulnerability among a majority of people in this country.\n\nIn the viral video, she described a certain emotional shallowness at the core of social life in Australia.\n\n\"There\u2019s this weird oppressive strange sensation in the air where you can feel, \u2018I\u2019m not supposed to really share anything genuinely authentic about how I\u2019m feeling.\n\n\"There\u2019s this sense that if you do so you are not safe and it will not be well received because people here don\u2019t know how to receive it,\" she said.\n\nIt's far from the first time a migrant has made waves with their assessment of Australian culture.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2023, an expat who had spent 15 years in Australia went incredibly viral after penning a lengthy essay critiquing their adopted country, diagnosing many of the same issues as Eloise, describing a sharp gender divide, a flippant attitude to social engagements, and saying that living in Australia felt like existing in the 1970s.\n\nGender issues takes backseat this federal election\n\nUnlike previous federal election campaigns, the issue of violence against women, and general attitudes towards women in Australian society, have not been major talking points ahead of the May 3 poll.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has previously called it a \"national crisis\" while Opposition leader Peter Dutton has suggested a Royal Commission was needed to address the issue.\n\nThe topic loomed large last federal election after then PM Scott Morrison refused to meet women outside parliament during the March 4 Justice rallies, which took place around the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndependent MP Zoe Daniel recently wondered why the issue had seemingly fallen by the wayside. \"Why is no one talking about violence against women in the lead up to the election, when women are being killed at rate of more than one a week,\" she said in a video on her Facebook page last week.\n\nMeanwhile earlier this week, Peter Dutton's Liberal party was forced to dump a candidate who believed women should not serve in the Australian Defence Force.\n\nProtesters rally outside Town Hall in response to the treatment of women in politics following several sexual assault allegations as part of the Women's March 4 Justice rally in Sydney in 2021. Source: Reuters\n\nSurvey shows nearly a third of Australians think there's a war on men\n\nAccording to the Plan International Australia Gender Compass, which ran a survey of 2,048 Australians aged 16 and older and published the results earlier this month, there is a gap between perception and reality regarding gender equality in Australia.\n\n\"While 60 per cent of people believe we are close to or have already achieved gender equality, real-world data on the gender pay gap, workplace discrimination and under-representation of women in leadership tell a different story,\" Plan International Australia chief executive Susanne Legena said.\n\n\"The fact that 50 per cent of Australians believe women are treated fairly in most areas of life ignores persistent challenges such as unpaid labour disparities, gender-based violence on our streets and in our homes and systemic barriers in career advancement.\"\n\nThe survey also suggested Australia has a way to go to achieve gender equality, with 30 per cent of respondents saying there is a war on men.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
