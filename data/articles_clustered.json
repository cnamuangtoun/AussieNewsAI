(Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nPolicies enabling women to withdraw super early for house deposits would make them significantly poorer in retirement, with less income to live on.\n\nThe SMC data showed women today retire with 25 per cent less super than men.\n\nThe median super balance of women aged 60 to 64 is $51,000 lower than for men, and women are around 10 per cent more likely to have no super at all.\n\nFrom July 1, \ufeffnew parents taking paid maternity or paternity leave can be paid superannuation.\n\nSchubert said this and other reforms are welcome, but more needs to be done.\n\nThey include: unfreezing the Low-Income Super Tax Offset, to help low-income women to build their super; paying super for all workers, including nannies, housekeepers and carers, and for all workers aged under 18; and enabling fairer splitting of super in divorce settlements whether or not they are handled in a court.",

It was quickly deleted but had already been widely circulated across social media.\n\n\"Imagine Max Holmes thinking it's a good idea to disrespect a legend of Australian football media in Caroline Wilson and trying to ridicule her,\" former Port Adelaide player Cornes said on SEN Trade Radio.\n\n\"And have a photo of that and put the captain alongside of it.\"\n\n'Makes you a loser': Brown hits out at Cats players over Mad Monday post Photo shows Two men smiling for the camera in costumes, one dressed as a woman, the other with a western hat and moustache. Mitch Brown, the first AFL player to reveal he is bisexual, hits out at Bailey Smith and Patrick Dangerfield over a social media post from Mad Monday.\n\nHolmes has gone as media personalities in past Geelong Mad Mondays, dressing up as SEN's Gerard Whateley in 2023 and Channel 7's Mitch Cleary in 2024.\n\nThese were widely received by the footballing community as in good taste, however, many took issue with the posting of the Wilson outfit.\n\nSmith's post came just weeks after he apologised by text to Geelong Advertiser photographer Alison Wynd for verbally abusing her at an open training session.\n\nMembers of the AFL's LGBTQIA+ community also took issue with another Instagram post from Smith, which referenced Brokeback Mountain while he and captain Patrick Dangerfield were hugging.\n\n\"This is what losing a granny does to you,\" Smith wrote.\n\nMitch Brown, the first AFL player to publicly reveal he is bisexual, joked via his own social media post: \"Just for the record Heath Ledger's way hotter\".\n\nHe then added, \"In all seriousness though, guys do better\".\n\n\"Last time I checked, losing a grand final doesn't make you gay, but being homophobic definitely makes you a loser.\"\n\nBailey Smith and Patrick Dangerfield pose during Geelong's Mad Monday celebrations. (Instagram)\n\nChief executive of Pride Cup Hayley Conway told ABC Sport it was disappointing to see jokes that centred around sexuality still featured at Mad Monday celebrations.\n\n\"My first reaction is how disappointing it is to see people using the experiences of gay and bisexual men \u2014 which is what the film Brokeback Mountain is about \u2014 as a punchline in a joke when they should be out celebrating what was really a pretty terrific season for the Geelong Cats,\" Conway said.\n\n\"Any joke like this has a really meaningful and deep impact on people. It stops them from coming out, it stops them from being true to who they are.\n\n\"LGBTQI young people have a six times higher rate of suicide than their straight peers. I think if we weigh that up, is it about the importance of a young person and their dignity and their self-respect or is it about our ability to tell a joke that we feel is funny \u2014 to me, that is not an equation at all.\"\n\nCornes also took issue with Brad Close, who dressed up as fanatical Geelong supporter \"Catman\".\n\n\"I thought that was one of the more embarrassing days at the Geelong footy club that I've seen in a while,\" Cornes said.\n\n\"They've owned this space for a long time, but at some point, you have just got to say, it's not book week, we're not in year five.\"",

It was the big moments he won that were the key.\n\nMaking up for the 2023 loss, where he was below his best, was on his mind.\n\n\"Oh yeah. Absolutely, hands down,\" Riki said.\n\n\"It was probably on a lot of us players' minds throughout the week. It was definitely on my mind.\n\n\"I had a few chats with Madge (coach Michael Maguire). Myself and a lot of other boys \u2026 kept saying 'redemption' throughout this whole week. To tick that box and obviously move on to the grand final is going to be awesome.\n\n\"All we can say is that we've been there, we've done that and we know what it's like. We took a lot of lessons from that 2023 year and obviously it's also not done. We've got one more game.\"\n\nRiki admits that he \"probably took that 2023 year for granted\" and it caught up with him in the decider.\n\n\"A lot of us boys that were in that team were deers in headlights really. We didn't really know what was going on,\" he said.\n\n\"The whole outside noise of media, fans and obviously the grand final parade \u2026 everything was a massive blur and you weren't really focusing on the game.\n\n\"Now we know that the games are most important. Obviously it's good to enjoy that week and soak it in with the fans. But at the end of the day, we have got to knuckle down and get that win.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nRiki's tackles on Cleary last Sunday showed total attention to his defensive role.\n\n\"I'd probably have clocked off a couple of years ago and not only myself, but a few of the other boys as well,\" he said.\n\n\"Madge has really nailed up into us about concentrating for the full 80 minutes.\n\n\"Concentration's massively important for us. We were a young team a couple of years ago and we've just evolved and turned into such a good team.\n\n\"I can just commend the coaching staff and everyone behind the scenes that have helped us get here.\"\n\nRiki had a wonderful match in the 26-0 qualifying final win over Melbourne in 2023. Another display like that would be just the tonic.\n\n\"They are such quality team,\" he said.\n\n\"We've had many great battles along the years. They're such a great club, great organisation and got great players as well.\n\n\"They're very experienced. It'll be a good game.

Let's look at the US markets first.\n\n\"Wall Street edged higher, following through from the post-PCE Index data move on Friday night. Enthusiasm was curbed by fresh dysfunction in the US government. Another shutdown looms, with Congress having only a couple of days to pass a funding bill to keep a myriad of federal services running. The most immediate implication for the markets is the shut down may delay the release of certain data, including the critical Non-Farm Payrolls report.\n\n\"In the bigger picture, some within the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans are threatening to permanently lay-off swathes of workers if a deal does not get done, threatening to put thousands out of work.\n\n\"At the margins, that would put upward pressure on unemployment and weaken economic activity. The primary focus for market participants is currently the path forward for US interest rates, with asset prices being supported by the notion that cuts are coming and they could end up being relatively deep.\n\n\"As the markets await the beginning of the final quarter of the year, the odds remain skewed to another Fed cut in October and December. The odds for a December move have diminished, however, largely due to some cautious language coming from Fed officials in the past week. The markets are ascribing a 68% implied probability of a cut at that meeting, down from over 80% last week. A soft or benign Non-Farm Payrolls report on Friday will help lift those odds. That is, of course, if the data is released at all this week.\"",

(Supplied: Noni Carroll)\n\n\"There are so many stories over the 20 years at Moorambilla where, at that pivotal moment in someone's life, there was an environment that celebrated their true sense of self,\" Ms Leonard said.\n\n\"That gave them an opportunity to meet like-minded people and to connect artistically \u2014 the most powerful antidote to any lack of social cohesion.\"\n\nMr Welsh said his cousin was now involved.\n\n\"I text him often to make sure he's staying on the straight and narrow,\" he said.\n\nStudents travel from as far south as Griffith, west to Bourke, east to Wellington and north to Tamworth to perform.\n\nOriginally just choral singing, the Moorambilla Voices ensemble now encompasses Japanese Taiko, drumming, dance and visual arts.\n\nThe choir will celebrate its 20th anniversary with sold-out concerts in Dubbo this weekend.\n\nIt hopes to sing at Sydney's Opera House next year for its 21st birthday.",

(Supplied: Gladstone Area Promotion and Development Ltd)\n\nSenior project manager Andrew Hunter said a development of that scale required time, adding the decision was \"frustrating\" and sent them \"back to square one\".\n\n\"We really wanted to see if we could get a satellite hospital [off] the ground, which requires support from the state government or one of the bigger private health providers,\" Mr Hunter said.\n\n\"We don't see any real town planning purpose in refusing the extension \u2026 our approval was under the current scheme and it still required further applications for the site.\n\n\" It just seems to be a waste of taxpayers' money, refusing it and making us go through an appeal and potentially having to look at other options for the site. \"\n\nPlans for a hospital and retirement facility were given preliminary approval in 2018. (Supplied: Zone Planning Group)\n\nIn a letter to the applicant, council staff said the companies failed to take reasonable steps to act on the approval and had not given sufficient reason for an extension.\n\nLimited services for growing population\n\nThe region's population of 3,000 more than triples in holiday periods, and hundreds of homes targeting over-50s, resort-style living are in staged construction.\n\nMr Hunter said demand for the project remained strong, with many retirees relocating from southern cities.\n\n\"In the 2021 census, 30 per cent of the population in Agnes Water was over 60, and with the popularity of these over-50s lifestyle communities, that population is going to continue to grow,\" he said.\n\n\"Those people need convenient access to higher levels of care than just a general practice.\"\n\nThe nearest hospitals are a 90-minute drive to Bundaberg or Gladstone. (ABC Capricornia: Ellie Willcox)\n\nThe applicant has lodged an appeal in the Planning and Environment Court.\n\nAmber Rodgers says it is disappointing the development approval was not extended.

(ABC News)\n\nJunk food 'like eating nothing'\n\nNutritional psychiatry researcher Megan Lee said people could become malnourished even if they ate a lot of food.\n\nShe said junk food did not have the \"correct nutrients\", including minerals, vitamins and fibre.\n\n\"When we eat ultra-processed foods, it's nutritionally basically like eating nothing,\" Dr Lee said.\n\nShe is part of a group reviewing Australia's dietary guidelines, with recommendations expected to be released in 2026.\n\nDr Lee said there was an over-reliance on junk food in Australian diets.\n\n\"Because we have been assaulting our taste buds with this hyper-sweet and salty food for decades, it takes a while for us to recalibrate back to fresh food,\" she said.\n\nJunk food is convenient and tasty, but lacks whole-food nutrition. (AAP: Dave Hunt)\n\nUltra-processed food and beverages are industrially formulated in factories, primarily from refined ingredients and additives with little or no whole foods.\n\n\"Junk foods\" like chicken nuggets, hot dogs, lollies and soft drinks have high calories, added sugars, refined starches, salt and unhealthy fats.\n\nUNICEF said these foods were designed to be convenient and highly palatable, but offered \"little in terms of vitamins, minerals or fibre\".\n\n\n\nIn high-income countries, including Australia and the US, the share of dietary energy derived from UPF ranges between 42 per cent and 58 per cent.\n\nObesity on the rise\n\nThe latest figures from the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare from 2022 showed a quarter of school-aged children were overweight or obese.\n\nThat is about 1.3 million children aged two to 17, a 20 per cent increase since 1995.\n\nBy 2050, half of the country's children are expected to be overweight or obese.\n\n\"Obesity is a growing concern that can impact the health and development of children,\" Ms Russell said.\n\n\" Ultra-processed food is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children's growth, cognitive development and mental health. \"\n\nAbout two-thirds of all Australians are obese or overweight. (Reuters)\n\nJunk food tax?\n\nThe UNICEF report made eight recommendations, including implementing \"food taxes and subsidies\", restrictions on food marketing, new policies to improve the availability and affordability of locally produced nutritious foods, and improvements in food labelling.\n\nIt said interventions were needed to prevent lifetime health and economic impacts.\n\n\"Individuals are stuck in a system where we are advertised UPFs every day, we've been eating it for decades and it's hard,\" Dr Lee said.\n\n\"UPFs are also cheaper, unfortunately, than whole foods. We're also working more and we don't have the time to be making things from scratch.\"\n\nDr Lee said the federal government should consider a tax.\n\n\"A tax on UPF is a good idea, not because we want to make food more expensive. We want to funnel that money into making healthier foods cheaper,\" she said.\n\nMegan Lee says a tax on UPF should be funnelled into supporting access to healthier food. (Supplied: Megan Lee)\n\nFarmers need people to eat more whole foods\n\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) said it supported the idea of a tax if the revenue raised went to farmers to subsidise costs.\n\n\"Increasing consumption of fresh fruit, vegetables and nuts is absolutely in the industry's interest,\" NFF Horticulture Council chair Jolyon Burnett said.\n\n\"It's one of those happy coincidences where it would align with a great community health outcome.\"\n\nMr Burnett said a tax on UPF was \"definitely worth looking carefully at\".\n\n\"One of the problems is UPF can be produced extremely cheaply in a huge volume with a lack of labour costs and fresh ingredients,\" he said.\n\nThe federal government said it was not considering a tax on UPF, but said fruit, vegetables and other core foods were exempt from GST, to support healthy food choices.\n\n\"Our government is working with the food industry to reduce the amount of sodium, sugar and saturated fat across a range of products through the Healthy Food Partnership Reformulation Program,\" a government spokesperson said.\n\n\"The government has also committed $3.5 million to develop Feeding Australia, a new national food security strategy.\n\n\"The aim of the strategy is to provide a long-term, whole-of-system plan to boost the productivity, resilience and security of our national food system.\"",

That game at Manly, it was good to go through that as a group. It highlighted some key areas that we were pretty poor at. I think we needed that to wake us up a little bit.\u201d Ezra Mam\u2019s try celebration was met with a chorus of boos by Manly fans. Credit: NRL Imagery That disastrous Sea Eagles loss was Brisbane at their worst. Commitment to the cause was hard to spot. Five-eighth Ezra Mam was booed with every touch in response to his perceived light punishment for a drug driving incident that left three people injured. A clumsy post-game interview from the five-eighth didn\u2019t help. Talk of player burnout under Maguire\u2019s polarising training methods gathered momentum. Especially given the knives were already out after the cut-throat way his predecessor Kevin Walters, a most popular figure with media heavy hitters and Broncos old boys, was rolled to make way.\n\nDressing room footage was analysed. CEO Dave Donaghy and chairman Karl Morris were put on blast, and leaders Reynolds and Kotoni Staggs were openly questioned about player revolt. \u201cExternally, all that chat was pretty big and hard to ignore,\u201d hooker Corey Paix says. Broncos coach Michael Maguire and Adam Reynolds. Credit: NRL Imagery \u201cBut we did because we were having the proper conversations, those very hard, very honest chats ourselves. \u201cAs a group, we ended up demanding commitment from one another because the coaches can say and do as much as possible, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s up to the players to turn it around.\n\n\u201cWe went back to work, trained harder, got in and did what we needed to. Looking back, that really was our turning point.\u201d When Brisbane emerged at the end of a long week, they ran onto Suncorp Stadium resembling the All Blacks in what is now an iconic, completely black kit as part of the club\u2019s mental health round and charity partnership with the Black Dog Institute. A 44-14 blitz of the Titans was Brisbane at their all-running, all-attacking best, just seven days after bottoming out at Brookvale. In 14 games since, they\u2019ve lost only twice - including a 22-2 defeat in Melbourne where Reynolds, Mam and Selwyn Cobbo all tore their hamstrings and their season was apparently gone.\n\nThe graft and grind their coach prizes above all else was plain to see in running down Penrith from 14-0, defending their goal line like demons all the while. Loading And as for Maguire\u2019s much-discussed intensity, methods, and a little madness, back-rower Jordan Riki can only laugh now. Along with Reynolds and prop Payne Haas, the Kiwi international\u2019s prior experience of Brisbane\u2019s new coach was eagerly, and at times apprehensively, mined by his teammates. For anyone who\u2019s had their fingers crushed in one of Maguire\u2019s vice-like handshakes - \u201cand he\u2019s got this big grin on his face when he does it\u201d Riki laughs - it\u2019s as good an indication as any of what you\u2019re in for. \u201cThere is a bit of an aura about him, you know, when he steps into a room that he needs everybody\u2019s attention and he needs you locked in and focused,\u201d Riki says.",

    "text": "It could be a rough exit meeting for: James Worpel and Mitchell have a bit to talk about. Worpel is a restricted free agent, and has interest from the Cats, having slipped in the Hawks\u2019 midfield pecking order. Will Mitchell offer him more time to stay, or will that depend on what hap]pens during the trade period? Jai Serong is likely to leave, while Sam Butler is mulling a shift to West Coast.\n\nSomething to look forward to: The Hawks have made no secret they want to beef up their list, and they will be busy through the trade period. They could yet land one of Zach Merrett, Christian Petracca or Zak Butters.\n\nWill Day is on the mend from another fractured foot. Loading Day remains the Hawks\u2019 most skilful player, but will need to be monitored closely for the rest of his career. The likes of Nick Watson and Ginnivan continue to add to their games, while skipper James Sicily will give his sore body time to heal over summer.\n\nPredicted best and fairest: Jai Newcombe.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nNick Daicos is in his prime and Scott Pendlebury is on the brink of the AFL games record. Credit: AFL Photos Collingwood (preliminary finalist) Wins: 17 Losses: 8. Draft picks: 34, 52, 64, 70 What went well: Plenty, despite being the \u201cDad\u2019s Army\u201d of the competition \u2013 their preliminary final team was the oldest line-up ever fielded in an AFL final. That they reached the penultimate weekend of the season meant this campaign was a success. Just not as successful as they had hoped. Nick Daicos had another superb season, capped with his second-straight runner-up finish in the Brownlow Medal count. Is there a better kick in the league? Brother Josh provided drive from half-back, while ruckman Darcy Cameron had a career year.\n\nSteele Sidebottom and Jack Crisp were consistent contributors, Jamie Elliott booted a team-high 60 goals, while former Giant Harry Perryman settled in well across half-back. Ned Long had a break-out year, while Scott Pendlebury, 37, defied his age until he was stopped by a calf strain in the opening minutes of the preliminary final. The AFL games record will be his in 2026 if he plays the eight more games needed to go past Brent Harvey on 432. It could be a rough exit meeting for: More than one Magpie, and even for the Magpies\u2019 list managers, for Elliott, 33, may need to be dissuaded from joining the Gold Coast Suns on a three-year deal, while Brody Mihocek, 32, has a three-year offer from Melbourne to consider. The Magpies, however, may tell Mihocek they won\u2019t budge from their two-year offer. Mason Cox, 34, faces an uncertain future, while Dan Houston \u2013 and the Pies \u2013 will agree they need more from him next season. Bobby Hill, having missed so much football because of personal issues, remains a close watch.\n\nSomething to look forward to: Houston was not the same counter-puncher he was at Port Adelaide in his first year with the Magpies \u2013 expect that to change next year. He is exemplary with ball in hand, and needs to have more of it. Skipper Darcy Moore had an indifferent season, and may need to revisit the balance between pure defending and hunting the ball. Get that right, and the Magpies \u2013 already built on defence \u2013 will be even stronger. Coach Craig McRae wants a blend of good draft picks and established players through this trade/draft period. They missed out on Jack Silvagni, but will trade for Swans\u2019 forward Jack Buller. Another established defender may be front of mind, for Jeremy Howe, 35, is showing signs of wear and tear. Predicted best and fairest: Nick Daicos.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nAdelaide (fifth after finals loss) Wins: 18 Losses: 7 Draft picks: 18, 41, 48, 54, 66, 72. What went well: There was much to like. The Crows not only leapt back into the finals for the first time since 2017, but won 12 of their final 13 home-and-away games to finish as minor premier.\n\nMatthews Nicks\u2019 game plan, essentially built on going long down the line, held up during the season proper. Taylor Walker may not like what he hears from the Crows\u2019 bosses in his end-of-season meeting. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Skipper Jordan Dawson and full-forward Riley Thilthorpe were All-Australians, while fellow forwards Taylor Walker and Darcy Fogarty, and forward-midfielder Ben Keays, also enjoyed strong home-and-away seasons. Former Demon Alex Neal-Bullen was a fine acquisition, and could be a future skipper. Izak Rankine provided creativity up field and close to goal, and was badly missed through suspension for a homophobic slur in September. \u201cWhat it did do was it changed the dynamic of our group,\u201d Nicks said of Rankine\u2019s absence. \u201cIzak is, and this is my opinion, one of the best players in the game, so I think if any team loses their best player, then it becomes quite challenging to replace that.\u201d It could be a rough exit meeting for: Taylor Walker. The champion forward, 35, is off contract, and his time may be up after a modest finals campaign. The Crows may feel Thilthorpe and Fogarty need to be empowered and shoulder greater responsibility. Fellow veteran Brodie Smith, 33, is also weighing up his future.\n\nSomething to look forward to: This was a year when the Crows built a foundation for what should be a five-year premiership tilt. Yes, they failed to win a quarter in their two finals defeats, becoming the first minor premiers in more than 40 years to be dumped from September in straight sets, but that sting should fire this squad. However, they do have holes. While unbeaten in 13 games against bottom nine teams, they were 6-7 against top nine teams, their scoring and defence dropping off. They need another X-factor in addition to Rankine, while a forward line of three talls didn\u2019t hold-up in September, when the ball is on the ground more. Another strong defender would also help. Nicks will need to tinker with his game plan. As he said after the semi-final loss to Hawthorn, it\u2019s harder to move the ball the way you want in the finals when the intensity rises. The Crows have been linked with off-contract Lions forward Callum Ah Chee.\n\n\n\nBest and fairest tip: Jordan Dawson.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Suns gun Matt Rowell takes a physical battering in every game he plays. Credit: Getty Images Gold Coast (sixth after finals loss) Wins: 16 Losses: 9 Draft picks 6, 14, 15, 32, 56, 68 What went well: The Suns have finally risen. This was a breakthrough season for a club, which not only made its maiden finals run in its 15th attempt, but conjured a miraculous win over the Dockers in Perth.\n\nSkipper Noah Anderson and fellow midfielder Matt Rowell were first-time All-Australians, their sustained efforts in the midfield a sight to behold. The physical punishment Rowell takes reminds us of the hits an NFL running back endures. Marking forward Ben King was superb in front of goal but will need to add a new trick or two. Fellow forward Ben Long had a breakout campaign, although he was disappointing in the semi-final, while recruits Daniel Rioli and John Noble delivered what was expected of them at half-back. Sam Collins is a beast at full-back, Touk Miller delivered run and carry, while Bailey Humphrey showed signs of morphing into the Suns\u2019 version of Cam Rayner. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Jed Walter. The young forward was dropped after round 19 and did not return to the side. While the former Suns academy product is contracted for next season, he could be used in a trade for Carlton\u2019s Charlie Curnow. While a star in the making, Mac Andrew will face a strong review of his finals performances.\n\nSomething to look forward to: There is plenty to look forward to with this emerging list, coach Damien Hardwick declaring his team is built for September. The base is there, it\u2019s now time to build internally and through canny trades. The Suns were too reliant on Rowell and Anderson, and need another robust midfielder who can deliver under pressure. The unicorn that is Ethan Read struggled in the semi-final but has the height and talent to be a long-term marking threat. They could lose Sam Flanders, who has two years remaining on his contract, and Malcolm Rosas, through the trade period. Best and fairest tip: Noah Anderson.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Fremantle (8th)\n\nWins: 16. Losses: 8. Draft picks 13, 31, 38, 49, 67. What went well: After last year\u2019s meltdown, when they slipped from the top eight at the start of August to 10th by the end, the Dockers held firm this year and returned to the finals for the first time since 2022, winning 12 of their last 14 games to finish sixth. Caleb Serong again starred in the Fremantle midfield. Credit: AFL Photos They adopted a more attacking gameplan after five losses from their first nine games, but failed to fully embrace this mantra in a stinging elimination final defeat to the Suns. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown so much throughout the year with the way we play our footy, the way we embrace challenges, the way we\u2019ve improved our footy on the road,\u201d coach Justin Longmuir said after the loss to the Suns.\n\nMarking talls Josh Treacy (44 goals) and Patrick Voss (37) had strong seasons, while Murphy Reid claimed the AFLPA\u2019s best young player award. Former premiership Tiger Shai Bolton (28) was arguably the recruit of the year. Defender Jordan Clark and midfield stud Caleb Serong were All-Australians, while Andrew Brayshaw was unlucky not to be. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Jye Amiss. While he played all 24 games, Amiss, a key marking tall, returned a modest 32 goals, and averaged career-lows in marks and disposals per game. He had only two touches (one goal) in the elimination final before being subbed off. Amiss could be a trade target. Then there\u2019s ruckman Sean Darcy. Will he and Luke Jackson continue to be a one-two punch in the ruck? We\u2019ll see.\n\nSomething to look forward to: The Dockers are building nicely. They had an average age of just 24.9 years through the season \u2013 the fourth youngest in the competition. Fremantle ruckman Sean Darcy. Credit: AFL Photos AFL great James Hird has set high expectations for them next year, despite their loss to the Suns on Saturday. \u201cI think they have to be top four next year with their list and the way they\u2019ve had the final this year and the performances against the best teams in the competition. I\u2019ve really gotten locked in that top four next year,\u201d Hird said. But they cannot afford to have lulls and slip back into a defensive mindset when the pressure is at its greatest. This will be Longmuir\u2019s greatest challenge.\n\nBest and fairest: Caleb Serong.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik GWS (7th) Wins: 16. Losses: 8. Draft picks: 12, 30, 36. What went well: After a dodgy first half of the year, the Giants won nine of their last 10 home-and-away games, scoring more than 100 points in each of them. In the end, they finished with one of the AFL\u2019s best attacking records, just two points behind third place.\n\nToby Greene and his Giants were eliminated at home by the Hawks. Credit: AFL Photos At their best, they were absolutely awe-inspiring: their stunning third quarters against the Swans in the second Sydney derby of the season, plus their (eventually unsuccessful) comeback against Hawthorn in their elimination final, will live long in the memory. The challenge will be closing the gap between their frightening best and their timid worst. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Everyone. The Giants have now lost their past four finals, including two at home (and three in Sydney) \u2013 the sort of record that each player needs to take a varying degree of responsibility for, as well as the coaching group, and will require them all to look deeply within over the summer. September stumbles are becoming too much of a theme. What\u2019s clear is that they concede too many entries, which can\u2019t be wholly pinned on the six poor blokes in defence who had to deal with that avalanche. All things considered, they managed OK, but it felt unsustainable, and so it has proved. And there\u2019s a similar problem going the other way. When they\u2019re on, they\u2019re on, but the Giants\u2019 attack falls to pieces when they mindlessly blaze away inside 50 as they did against Hawthorn, which completely undermines their forward set-up. Composure in key moments is lacking in this side across every line, and that\u2019s not an easy thing to add.\n\nSam Taylor is a star defender for GWS, but the Giants\u2019 defensive unit is under pressure. Credit: AFL Photos Something to look forward to: As Adam Kingsley said post-match, the Giants still have \u201call the pieces\u201d to contend, although their ageing stars are running out of petrol. But the window remains open, their next tier of rising stars will be better with another season under their belts and if they can address their inconsistencies, get to the psychological nub of their finals failures and have some better luck with injuries, there\u2019s no reason why they won\u2019t be back contending again in 2026. Best and fairest tip: Finn Callaghan showed exactly why St Kilda threw a $17 million, 10-year contract offer at him; thank heavens he said no. He and Tom Green (likely second in the best and fairest) run this team now.\n\n\u2013 Vince Rugari Western Bulldogs (9th)\n\nWins: 14. Losses: 9. Draft picks: 10, 28 What went well: Offensive power. The Doggies poured on the goals this season, scoring more points (2493) than any other team. Led by Marcus Bontempelli, Tom Liberatore, Ed Richards and an increasingly influential Sam Darcy up forward, they beat up teams with regularity. While that resulted in a 14-9 record, the team from the west missed the finals. The Bulldogs were an offensive juggernaut in 2025 but still missed finals. Credit: Getty Images It could be a rough exit meeting for: Jamarra Ugle-Hagan. The one-time No.1 draft pick has occupied so much of the Bulldogs top brass\u2019 time this season. It would be fascinating to witness his official exit meeting given there\u2019s so much to discuss for a player who didn\u2019t add to his tally of 67 AFL games this season. Defenders will be in the spotlight, too, but each player on the list will be pressed for explanations as to why the Dogs simply couldn\u2019t beat teams who were vying for finals spots.\n\nSomething to look forward to: Plenty, to be truthful. The Dogs have recorded 14 wins in consecutive seasons; in 2024 they played finals, so they can\u2019t wallow in pity about what happened this year. Jamarra Ugle-Hagan didn\u2019t play a game for the Bulldogs this season. Credit: Justin McManus Darcy, at age 22, remains one of the most exciting young players in the game. Aaron Naughton\u2019s best season (65 goals) is a beacon of hope for even better things, too. Best and fairest tip: I\u2019ve landed on Ed Richards ahead of Tom Liberatore. Bontempelli\u2019s missed games through injury will cost him.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits Port Adelaide (13th)\n\nWins: 8. Losses: 15. Draft picks: 26, 42, 60 What went well: That\u2019s tough to answer because this was an extremely disappointing year, despite Ken Hinkley\u2019s protestations the list is set up well for 2026. Port Adelaide chairman David Koch stuck with Ken Hinkley to the end. Credit: Getty Images Having made a preliminary final last year, the Power slipped markedly. However, skipper Connor Rozee and fellow star midfielder Zak Butters were typically industrious, while forward Mitch Georgiades delivered a half-century of goals for the first time. Aliir Aliir enjoyed another stellar season in defence, while Travis Boak and Hinkley were given a classy send-off against the Suns, the victory fully deserved. Zak Butters won Port Adelaide\u2019s best and fairest award - the John Cahill Medal - for the third consecutive year in 2025. Credit: Getty Images\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: President David Koch and his board. The succession plan designed to ease Hinkley out and Josh Carr to prepare for the senior role next season was done with the best of intentions, but the scoreboard says it was a failure. If Hinkley wasn\u2019t the man to take the team forward, then Carr should have been immediately installed, and Hinkley given a thank-you payout for his years of fine service. Something to look forward to: The Power should be back in the finals hunt next year, but they will need to get busy in the trade period. Do they have enough true stars? Missing out on Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera will hurt.\n\nLate season injuries have given the youngsters a chance. We like what we have seen of Jack Whitlock, who can play ruck and go forward. Best and fairest winner: Zak Butters.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Essendon (15th)\n\nWins: 6. Losses: 17. Draft picks: 4, 5, 22, 25. What went well: The Bombers have some superb youngsters. In his second year, Nate Caddy again gave glimpses of the player he could become, with 20 goals and more flashes of brilliance.\n\nIsaac Kako gave Bombers fans something to get excited about. Credit: AFL Photos Isaac Kako impressed with his smarts around goals and showed late in the season he can also be developed as a pinch-hitter in the centre square. Archie Roberts, the lowest draft pick of the trio, could end up being a steal. The teenager is advanced beyond his years, demonstrating composure and skill in a defence that was under siege. Angus Clarke is another of the club\u2019s 15 debutants this year who has provided Bombers fans with hope in a wretched campaign.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Ben Hobbs. In his fourth season, Hobbs, 21, failed to take a more significant role in the side. Worryingly for Hobbs, despite Essendon\u2019s litany of injuries, he was dropped for the first leg of the final round and could not break back into the team. Hobbs has stagnated in his past two seasons, reaching 20 disposals in just three of his past 30 games. His disposal remains a worry. If time has run out for the first-round pick from the 2021 draft, it would raise further queries on the Bombers\u2019 recruiting and player development. Something to look forward to: The draft. The Bombers have a strong hand in this year\u2019s draft after acquiring Melbourne\u2019s first selection through a pick swap last year. Even accounting for father/son, academy and NGA picks, the Bombers should have access to two very good youngsters. If Sam Draper departs through free agency, that should deliver another first-round pick. Unfortunately for the Dons, this is not considered the strongest draft, but one experienced recruiter has said they would not be surprised if smokies emerge deeper in the pool.\n\nBest and fairest: Zach Merrett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu West Coast (18th) Wins: 1. Losses: 22. Draft picks: 1, 14, 19, 32, 50. What went well: Sorry West Coast fans, this is not pretty. The Eagles have managed 11 wins in four seasons, including just one victory, over St Kilda, in a torturous 2025 season.\n\nBut there\u2019s always a glimmer of hope and performances and players to celebrate. Two-time Richmond premiership player Jack Graham, who joined the Eagles for 2025, comfortably exceeded his career average for disposals (19.2 possessions per game this season) and had 7.8 tackles per game (which is considered \u201celite\u201d). It could be a rough exit meeting for: The defensive unit and the defence coaches. West Coast comfortably conceded the highest number of points (2438) this season, leaving them with a limp percentage of 60.1. If premierships are built from the backline, they need to focus there. It will be fascinating to see the club\u2019s attitude towards Tim Kelly, who played 19 games in his sixth season with the Eagles. Something to look forward to: It couldn\u2019t get any worse, could it? If West Coast haven\u2019t bottomed out, where is the bottom?\n\nThe Eagles can expect the No.2 draft pick as compensation for losing free agent Oscar Allen to Brisbane, so that\u2019s something. And Harley Reid is staying for now, having resisted interest from big Victorian clubs to extend until the end of 2028. Eagles fans can only look forward to better times ahead. Best and fairest tip: Jack Graham.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits North Melbourne (16th)\n\nWins: 5 Losses: 17 Draws: 1 Draft picks: 20, 21, 39, 57 What went well: They made it out of the bottom two! The Kangaroos and coach Alastair Clarkson would have liked to see more progress on the ladder, but he remains bullish they are heading in the right direction. North Melbourne avoided another bottom-two finish. Credit: Getty Images After a torrid first six rounds and the odd thrashing beyond that, North were generally more competitive, including securing a draw with Brisbane, but there were no statement wins. Instead, they would be pleased with Harry Sheezel\u2019s transition to a midfield-forward role, the continued development of Colby McKercher and career-best seasons from Cam Zurhaar and Paul Curtis.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Will Phillips. The No.3 pick in the COVID-19-impacted 2020 draft class played only seven matches this season and does not appear to be in the Roos\u2019 plans. He should latch on somewhere, but needs to get going to save his career. Something to look forward to: Next year promises to be the season when North Melbourne finally take a genuine leap. How high that is remains to be seen, but the expectations must rise, even if that is as modest as aiming for between eight and 10 wins. The young talent is there, and they may have finally found Nick Larkey\u2019s sidekick in Cooper Trembath. A stiffer defence and another progression from their midfield group should enable them to take another belated step.\n\nBest and fairest: Luke Davies-Uniacke.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan Richmond (17th) Wins: 5. Losses: 18. Draft picks: 2,3 What went well: Plenty for a club that was widely tipped to sail through turbulent waters with a drastically young and inexperienced list.\n\nThe season began on the best note possible with a stunning round-one win over Carlton. The nature of the victory, a come-from-behind triumph, set the tone for the season for both the Tigers and Blues. Throw in highlights from Maurice Rioli jnr, and all was swell. Tim Taranto had a strong season as one of the Tigers\u2019 on-field leaders. Credit: AFL Photos It could be a rough exit meeting for: The club\u2019s forwards and the forward coaches. The Tigers scored the fewest number of points (1449), less even than West Coast, a club that limped to one victory, compared to Richmond\u2019s five. Veteran spearhead Tom Lynch could cop a drive-by sledge for missing games. He played only 16 matches (due largely to a suspension) after a tough couple of years with injuries.\n\nSomething to look forward to: There\u2019s so much to look forward to. Realistically, the Tigers will battle to replicate their win-loss tally (5-18) as they continue to develop their young group. It could be a case of the \u201csecond-year blues\u201d for a host of players. But Richmond will be eyeing off their matches against Carlton and the chance to knock them off again. Best and fairest tip: Tim Taranto.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits St Kilda (12th)\n\nWins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 7, 43, 58. What went well: The Saints were a popular choice to sink into the bottom four, but finished three wins clear of that territory while prioritising youth. The Saints will welcome Tom De Koning in 2026 and welcome back Max King after another injury-riddled season. Credit: AFL Photos St Kilda\u2019s round two upset of Geelong was a false dawn, but a peek at their upside. They also demolished Fremantle and executed the greatest three-quarter-time comeback from 46 points down against Melbourne. That latter win was the first of four in a row before they almost upset GWS in round 24.\n\nNasiah Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s emergence as a top-liner was massive, while Max Hall followed Cooper Sharman and Max Heath as a mid-season draft success story. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Zak Jones. The brother of ex-Demons captain Nathan was not one of the five Saints who re-signed last week, and faces an uncertain future. Jones turns 31 in March, and St Kilda already made it clear they want to get younger in the midfield. Something to look forward to: Another two years from Wanganeen-Milera, who they retained despite Adelaide and Port Adelaide wanting him.\n\nThere is optimism about what Mattaes Phillipou, Darcy Wilson, Alix Tauru and Tobie Travaglia can become, while the likes of Hugo Garcia, Isaac Keeler, Hugh Boxshall and Lance Collard also show promise. Tom De Koning will be on the list in 2026, and Max King will hopefully be fit again. Best and fairest tip: Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan Sydney (10th) Wins: 12. Losses: 11. Draft picks: 9, 27, 45, 63. What went well: Having won just four of their first 12 games under new coach Dean Cox, the Swans showed fortitude to rebound and win eight of their final 11 games.\n\nBrodie Grundy returned to his best form for Sydney in 2025. Credit: AFL Photos Playmaker Isaac Heeney had a tough start, but then reminded everyone why he is a legitimate star. Chad Warner was a consistent threat through the midfield, but did not have the impact he enjoyed through 2022-24. A serious ankle injury through the pre-season sidelined Errol Gulden for months and seriously hurt the Swans\u2019 midfield and creative drive, just as his return in round 15 had the reverse effect. Brodie Grundy reinforced why he is one of the competition\u2019s premier ruckmen.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Skipper Callum Mills. For the Swans to make the leap next season, Mills needs to consistently be on the park. His 2024 campaign was derailed after injuring his rotator cuff in a Mad Monday celebration. He missed the first half of this year because of plantar fascia. He needs to lead the way in 2026. Something to look forward to: This has been a year of recalibration for the Swans, and learning, particularly for Cox, who is now more at ease in the top role after replacing John Longmire. While it feels somewhat of a wasted year, the Swans are still in top-four mode, and are likely to be strengthened through the trade period. They just need to get moving earlier next season. Best and fairest tip: Isaac Heeney.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nCarlton (11th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 34, 44, 62*. What went well: Not much. George Hewett was one of few Blues to exceed expectations, putting together a career-best season in the midfield. Jack Silvagni and Tom De Koning are both leaving the Blues. Credit: Getty Images Better known as a defensive onballer, Hewett became a prolific ball-winner in his own right. In his 12th season on an AFL list, the former Swan is a strong chance to win his first best and fairest award.\n\nVeteran Nick Haynes overcame a horror start at the club to become dependable defender. He deserves another year. Young midfielder Cooper Lord is one to watch. George Hewett stepped up for the Blues in 2025, but didn\u2019t get enough support. Credit: Getty Images The Blues blooded seven debutants, the best of whom looks to be key defender Harry O\u2019Farrell, who, unfortunately, injured his knee. Other gains were bitter-sweet. Jack Silvagni was a revelation in defence but played just 13 games and is now on the move. Ollie Hollands found plenty of the ball in his new role as a running defender but his kicking needs work. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Mitch McGovern. The Blues are keen to get money off their books and the writing is on the wall for the 30-year-old, who narrowly missed a games trigger that would have earned a contract extension.\n\nWith Silvagni walking out and O\u2019Farrell to be unsighted for much of 2026, the defender may yet get another year, but it will be on the Blues\u2019 terms. Veterans Adam Saad and Blake Acres both had ordinary seasons. Something to look forward to: With mass change underway in the coaches box, free agents Tom De Koning and Silvagni confirming their departures, and ongoing chatter about Charlie Curnow, it\u2019s already been a turbulent off-season for the Blues, and the AFL home and away season isn\u2019t even officially over yet! Expect that turmoil to continue for some time yet. But once they ride that out, there will be hope again. The departures of De Koning and Silvagni will strengthen the Blues\u2019 draft hand to acquire highly-rated Harry Dean as a father-son pick.\n\nDecimated by injury in 2025, the Blues can vault back into finals contention with a cleaner bill of health. Curnow (assuming he stays) and Sam Walsh had interrupted preseasons which severely impacted their year. Harry McKay missed half the season. Matthew Cottrell and Elijah Hollands, two of their best runners, hardly played, and heart-and-soul defender Nic Newman didn\u2019t get on the field at all. Then there\u2019s the prospect of a fit Jagga Smith. Get all them right and the Blues should be stronger \u2013 but this was a year when they fell well below expectations. Best and fairest tip: George Hewett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu\n\nMelbourne (14th) Wins: 7. Losses: 16. Draft picks: 23, 51, 59* What went well: Kysaiah Pickett graduated from a star goalsneak to a game-breaking midfielder/forward who now rivals skipper Max Gawn as the club\u2019s best player. Despite their troubles, the Demons secured Pickett\u2019s prized signature in a huge coup, keeping him in the red and the blue until the end of 2034 on a lucrative contract. Midfielders Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver are stars for Melbourne and both have long-term contracts, but that no longer means their respective futures at the club are guaranteed. Credit: Getty Images Gawn was again a colossus, talking through action on the field and becoming their spokesperson for almost every crisis off it.\n\nRebounding defender Jake Bowey has taken the next step to become a driver of the team while Harvey Langford, the No.6 pick in last year\u2019s draft, is the Demons\u2019 next A-grade midfielder after making a seamless transition to senior football. Veteran forward Jake Melksham, with 33 goals from 18 games, earned himself another contract, which was confirmed by the Demons just days after their season ended. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Clayton Oliver and Christian Petracca. Do two of Melbourne\u2019s greatest players want to stay? If either player wants out, the club should not stand in their way.\n\nComing back from a life-threatening injury, Petracca\u2019s season was steady, and he will likely finish in the top six of the club\u2019s best and fairest award, but a long way from his game-breaking ways. Loading Oliver was better than last year when his campaign was compromised by his off-field issues. Both still have time to return to their best but the competition trend away from contest and stoppage towards speed and ball use is against them. Jacob van Rooyen went backwards in a season the club needed him to hold down a key forward posting.",

It was very overwhelming and heartbreaking to try and be her daughter in those moments and trying to be there for her.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it was an emotionally charged situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the most heartbreaking part was when the doctors told me that my mother was dying and they looked at me to translate it to her. And I really couldn't get myself to say those words to her, the words just got stuck in my throat. So I didn't tell her that - and to this day I wish she could have been told directly by someone, so she knew. I really believe no family should ever have to be put in that position.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJinhyun Cho is a senior lecturer in the department of linguistics at Macquarie University.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says circumstances like these are unethical - and avoidable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not fair to ask family members who are bilingual to do interpreting. I mean ethically, it's not fair, it's not right. Because in Australia, we have healthcare interpreter services.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Cho believes Australia's language workforce, which is made up of more than 20,000 interpreters and translators are \"invisible\" to many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not many people know the differences between translating and interpreting. The biggest difference is that translation is written whereas interpreting is spoken. In Australia, translators and interpreters. They are invisible. You know, in other countries such as Korea and China, they often appear in media because they interpret for high-ranking officials. And they follow the president on state visits. So they are like celebrities. In Australia, how many translators and interpreters do we see in media?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor over three decades, Selina Phan has been a Vietnamese interpreter and translator.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it's not just language she's conveying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are things that are being said, not just in words, not being uttered. But you, as an interpreter, you understand both cultures. And therefore when you interpret you have to convey the meaning in full.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Rosemary Wyber at the Australian National University is also a clinical GP at Companion House, a health service for refugees in the ACT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Interpreters are transformative in our capacity to deliver healthcare to people who speak a language other than English. There's simply no substitute for people being able to hear medical information in their own language and more importantly to be able to tell their story in their own language. And even though there's not a translator in the room with us. It's a service that's provided through the phone. I can see the relief and the happiness that people take from being able to tell their own story and know that they're being understood.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Cho says accurately conveying the meaning of a health condition or diagnosis is challenging for translators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are many concepts that cannot be translated into other languages. Taking depression as an example, in many countries in Africa, depression doesn't exist. And people there they see someone who is depressed as lazy, or that person sleeps too much. If the interpreter is not familiar with that kind of culture, how would that be interpreted.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe development and adoption of AI also poses another challenge for translators.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early September, Apple announced its headphone product, AirPods, now has live translating capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAd: \"Want to translate a message, call or conversation in person?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company says the feature is set to \"bridge language barriers in person\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, language-learning app, Duolingo more than doubled its content offering; launching 148 new language courses with the assistance of generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt previously took 12 years to develop the initial 100 courses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has also published a report which aims to quantify the \"AI applicability\" of various occupations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt identified translators and interpreters as being most at risk, with 98 per cent of the tasks overlapping.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut professional translator Ms Phan believes she can work alongside the technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look, I don't see it as a risk. AI is here, technology, all these new technologies are you know here. In fact, they've been here for ages. We need to work with it, and adapt, so that it works for us - and not against us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not uncommon for language service providers to use artificial intelligence to provide a rough translation in the first instance, which is then reviewed by humans for accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Cho says there are pitfalls with the current technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It often takes more amount of time than translating the text by themselves - because ... depending on the quality of machine generated translation. Then, another issue is that the payment tends to be low for post-editing. Because language service providers have these rating systems. And because you translate the whole text by yourself, so the payment is higher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Rosemary Wyber says as a clinical GP she can see the benefits, as along as the technology is used appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we can work together with a patient, a translating service and a clinician to all be on the same page and have a shared understanding of the medical issues - what's working, what's not working - that really enables care to be delivered in a way that would be impossible without translating services.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKaBik says there should be more clarity about what services are available to Australians in emergency situations.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Jerry (not his real name) was looking for a shortcut \u2014 he wanted to obtain permanent residency in Australia by Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo using the Chinese e-commerce app Xiaohongshu, the international student posted a request online in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wrote he was looking for a \"primary applicant\" to take him along to lodge subclass 189 and 190 skilled migration applications \u2014 both of which are permanent visas for skilled migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\nA reply came back, saying they could act as his agent with a \"ready-made\" primary applicant with \"a very high score\".\n\n\n\nHow 'spouses' for skilled visas are sold on the black market\n\nIn Australia\u2019s skilled migration program, a primary applicant applies for permanent residency based on qualifications and work experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey may include a spouse or children as secondary applicants. Only one spouse can be included. The applicants are points-tested based on factors such as age, work experience, education, and English proficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS Mandarin has uncovered that a secondary applicant place, which should be reserved for family, is being openly sold on the black market through online apps such as Xiaohongshu.\n\n\n\nJerry* used a Chinese e-commerce app to find a migration agent. Credit: SBS Mandarin The migration agent who replied to Jerry said they would charge tens of thousands of dollars. Jerry said this was considered \"market rate\".\n\n\n\n\n\nJerry \u2014 who requested anonymity for this story \u2014 met the agent at their Sydney office in April and signed the contract in May.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, he paid a $5,000 deposit, signed a contract and the agent told Jerry they'd found him a \"partner\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They helped us match with a suitable primary applicant,\" Jerry told SBS Mandarin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That primary applicant had to have a very high score, was within state nomination quotas, and the profession had to be on the skilled occupation list.\"\n\n\n\n'She told me how to pose for photos'\n\nThe migration agent found Jerry a fake \"spouse\" in nursing with a migration score of 90 points.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the match, to prove their spousal relationship, they had to fabricate a series of cohabitation documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had to start building a de-facto relationship,\" Jerry said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The (agent) required us to go out together for meals, take intimate photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The (agent) would instruct us how to pose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I felt something was wrong because my primary applicant was very skilled at taking these photos, as if she had done it with others before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She told me exactly where to put my hand, how to pose for the photo.\"\n\n\n\nThe migration agent told Jerry to open a joint bank account in which combined spending between him and his partner had to go through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the government would believe we were living together,\" Jerry explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They even said they would help us produce utility bills, and rent a place together.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJerry said the application process arranged by the agent was \"very efficient\". In July, the agent told him he would be granted permanent residency by Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcited at the prospect of finalising his dream within months, he went straight to pay the second instalment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That joy clouded my judgement,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I lost my basic ability to think clearly.\"\n\n\n\n'My whole body was trembling'\n\nBut earlier this month, a phone message shattered his ambitions. It was the \"nurse\" \u2014 his fake spouse \u2014 with a confession to make.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told Jerry that the migration agent had \"tricked\" her into meeting and taking staged photos with other secondary applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only was she not even a nurse in NSW, her points were fabricated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I read this message in the morning, I was shocked awake,\" Jerry said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My whole body was trembling.\"\n\n\n\nJerry joined a victims' chat group, and discovered that not only had he not been invited, but no application had ever been lodged under his name.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe discovered that the screenshots he was sent from what was purported to be the Department of Home Affairs' official website were fake.\n\n\n\n\n\nJerry met someone with the same fake spouse as him and compared the screenshots \u2014 they were identical, bar details like the date of birth.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe called the Department of Home Affairs, which confirmed there was in fact, no application lodged in his name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From that day, my life just stopped.\"\n\n\n\nAn estimated multi-million dollar scam with multiple alleged victims\n\nLater, many victims in the group chat said the joint accounts they had set up with their fake spouse had been shut down by the agents, and all the money inside was taken away.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 90 people are part of that victims' group, scammed of an estimated amount exceeding $10 million, according to Jerry.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome victims confronted the agents, but instead of resolving the issue, they were threatened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They told us directly: if you keep making trouble, we will make sure you cannot stay in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They said they would report our visas, and even insulted us as 'trash from China's lower class'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some victims said their visas really had been reported by the agents, leaving them without any valid status in Australia, forcing them to return home.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The new scam that could target anyone scrolling social media\n\nSBS News has contacted the Department of Home Affairs for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, the department issued a notice to the public stating it was cracking down on dodgy migration agents who'd ripped off applicants through unlawful migration advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour scam agents operating in Australia illegally in Victoria and Queensland \u2014 who were charging people $1.4 million for protection visas when the applicants were not asylum seekers \u2014 were detained and another three are being deported, it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you'e a visa applicant, scam agents may tell you to provide false or misleading information and false documents when applying for a Protection visa,\" the department said in a Facebook post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But this activity is illegal and could result in you facing large fines and possible jail time for up to 10 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSean Dong, a senior lawyer and migration agent at ProActive Legal, said the department has the power to investigate and cancel visas if fraud is detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If refused, there will be a three-year bar, meaning most visas cannot be granted,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDong said people should look for only licenced migration lawyers, which can be checked on the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority website.\n\n\n\n\n\nJerry said he has now reported the matter to NSW Police, and he'd been granted a case number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Mandarin.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "In 2019, Egyptian Australian businessman Ahmed Sokarno arrived in Tehran to sell to a group of Iranians the dream of a new life in a \"land of opportunities\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSokarno's offer was simple: Invest in Australian disability accommodation, get \"guaranteed\" annual returns of between 10 and 24 per cent and secure permanent business visas.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral of them bought in, transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies set up by Sokarno and his company, then known as Auscare.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the investors, Saadegh Shams Haaeri, tells SBS News his wife Zainab Kaaranjaam \"had a dream about Australia\".\n\n\n\n[We wanted to] grow our children in a free, fair, and developed country \u2026 We wanted to have a better future for our baby.\n\nShams and Kaaranjaam are pharmacists who co-owned a pharmacy in Tehran \u2014 a business they sold to fund their $600,000 investment in Australia.\n\n\n\nSaadegh Shams Haaeri says the $600,000 he and his wife Zainab Kaaranjaam invested through Ahmed Sokarno represented 20 years of hard work. Source: SBS News / Otis Filley In addition to the promise of \"guaranteed\" returns, investors' confidence in Auscare was bolstered by the fact that, at the time, the company's director was a former premier of Queensland, Rob Borbidge.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some investors made it to Australia, their dreams never eventuated.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2022, all of the money they'd transferred was in bank accounts to which they had no access, and construction of the homes was yet to start.\n\n\n\nSaadegh Shams Haaeri and Zainab Kaaranjaam invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy land in Melbourne's north-western suburb of Melton. Source: SBS News / Otis Filley Some have now returned to Iran, while others remain in Australia, working whatever jobs they can to make ends meet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir story is among the many unrealised promises that have emerged in connection with the National Disability Insurance Scheme's (NDIS) Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) program, which relies on private sector investment.\n\n\n\n'Everything looked very legitimate'\n\nIn July 2019, dozens of Iranians gathered at a hotel in Tehran to hear how Sokarno could help them secure temporary 188 Business Innovation and Investment visas \u2014 a pathway to permanent residency if a successful business is up and running. (The visa class was discontinued in July 2024.)\n\n\n\n\n\nHis proposal involved setting up a joint company with each investor to buy land, construct SDA housing and then collect rent from NDIS participants \u2014 revenue he told prospective investors was \"guaranteed\" because of the government's commitment to the NDIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This business is guaranteed income because you get paid by the government,\" Sokarno told the seminar's attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo other investors, Amir Mohammadi and Hamidreza Dehghanian \u2014 who lost $462,900 and $115,600, respectively \u2014 tell SBS News that it was this promise of government support that won them over.\n\n\n\nAhmed Sokarno told seminar attendees that Auscare was one of \"the very small number of companies in Australia [that] provide services for accommodation and disability services\". Source: Supplied SBS News is aware of at least three other Iranian investors who also signed on.\n\n\n\n\n\nShams says he \"didn't have any doubts because they gave us a lot of guarantees for the success of the business\".\n\n\n\nEverything looked very convincing and everything looked very legitimate.\n\nSokarno told participants they could expect returns of between 10 and 24 per cent per annum, stressing this was far higher than mainstream residential rental returns of between 4 and 6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo put this into perspective, an initial investment of $600,000 would, according to Sokarno, deliver a return of between $60,000 and $144,000 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contracts Shams and Dehghanian ended up signing stated that their return on investment would be up to 24 per cent and no less than 10 per cent per year, while Mohammadi's contract promised returns of up to 28 per cent.\n\n\n\nSaadegh Shams Haaeri received a large amount of Auscare material singing the praises of SDA investment before he decided to invest. Source: SBS News / Otis Filley Experts tell SBS News promises of the SDA market providing \"guaranteed\" returns, especially returns that high, are misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to questions about these projections, Sokarno tells SBS News he \"believed it was an honest representation at the time\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was, and continues to be, a high demand for SDA housing, and the potential returns vary depending on the property's location. These factors were communicated as part of the overall investment considerations,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his 2019 seminar in Tehran, Sokarno also mentioned several times that Auscare's director was Rob Borbidge, who served as Queensland's premier from 1996 to 1998.\n\n\n\nRob Borbidge (third from right), Ahmed Sokarno (second from right) and Ali Shahami (far right) at a 2019 Melbourne event seeking to attract SDA investors.

Shams says they were convinced someone of his stature was \"not going to ruin his reputation\" by being associated with a company that isn't reputable.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorbidge stepped down from his director role in July 2022, around the same time Auscare changed its name to Care Services Australia following a legal challenge from a similarly named company.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to questions put by SBS News, Borbidge denied he had any knowledge of the matters raised or involvement with any investors, saying: \"To the best of my recollection, I] have never met any of the individuals referred to.\"\n\n\n\nRob Borbidge talks with soon-to-be-elected Queensland Premier David Crisafulli at an election debate in Brisbane on 16 October 2024. Source: AAP / Darren England \"I have never received any communication from the individuals concerned in regard to the matters you have raised during my time with Care Services Australia or since,\" Borbidge says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, he was hit with a $112,361 tax bill for unpaid employee super payments that Care Services Australia allegedly failed to make during his tenure as director, The Courier Mail reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News understands Borbidge paid the outstanding amount, and the action was discontinued.\n\n\n\n'Not the time to think \u2026 time to act'\n\nMohammadi says that, at the time of the 2019 Tehran seminar, he was led to believe that \"Auscare is one of the best companies in Australia\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAuscare \u2014 now Care Services Australia \u2014 was and remains a relatively small company.\n\n\n\n\n\nPromotional material sent to investors ahead of the seminar describes Auscare as one of the \"top three\" NDIS providers in Australia, a point that also helped win over some investors.\n\n\n\nSaadegh Shams Haaeri says what drew him to Australia was \"the promise that if you invest and work hard here, you\u2019ll be rewarded \u2014 with permanent residency, a secure life and the chance to contribute meaningfully to the community\". Source: SBS News / Otis Filley When asked whether this was an appropriate claim to make, Sokarno tells SBS News: \"It is an accurate description, as we have been recognised as one of the leading providers with a strong focus on multicultural communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat material was shared by Ali Shahami, an Iranian-Australian migration agent, who was closely involved in recruiting the Iranian investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the company does not appear in any reputable listing of top-rated or large-scale NDIS providers.\n\n\n\nA flyer for the 2019 Tehran seminar shows Ahmed Sokarno alongside Iranian-Australian migration agent Ali Shahami.

It is time to act,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2019 interview with a Persian-language community station, Shahami was introduced as the business development manager of Auscare, and promised investors that the company could organise a \"work dinner\" with the NDIS minister.\n\n\n\nIranian-Australian migration agent Ali Shahami told seminar attendees: \"Auscare is very good for the 188 visa, it has been embraced by [people in] China and Saudi Arabia, and they have started with Iran recently.\" Source: Supplied Sokarno confirmed to SBS News that Auscare engaged Shahami's company \"as a consultant from 3rd February 2020 to 24th March 2020\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News approached Shahami with a list of questions, but received no response.\n\n\n\n'I felt there was something wrong'\n\nAt the Tehran seminar and in contracts signed with investors, Sokarno promised that, upon receiving the final investment amounts, NDIS-approved properties would be up and running within nine to 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least two of the investors pulled out before providing all of the funds. They say they are still waiting for their money to be refunded.\n\n\n\n\n\nDehghanian came to Australia in May 2022. At this point, he had only handed over $115,600 of a promised $420,000 as he had \"some hesitations [to pay the full amount] and decided to come to Australia and see the situation first\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I came to Australia, I felt there was something wrong and the investment was not going to work,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2023, he sought to exit the deal, but Sokarno quickly became unresponsive, Dehghanian says, adding that he was unable to afford a lawyer to take the matter to court.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Sokarno, Dehghanian's deposit was not repaid because, under the terms of the agreement, \"early termination did not entitle the investor to an automatic full refund, particularly where funds had already been committed to project-related expenses\".\n\n\n\nHamidreza Dehghanian, who was a GP in Iran, says due to the \"economic, social, and cultural situation in Iran\", he no longer felt comfortable raising his children there. Source: SBS News / Otis Filley Mohammadi paid more than $462,000 of the promised $600,000 and planned to pay the rest after he landed in Australia in late 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says that, during his two weeks in Australia, he had several meetings with Sokarno and Shahami to discuss the project.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he soon became suspicious \u2014 especially when Sokarno refused to show him statements for their joint company's bank account, to which he still hadn't been granted access.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther investors allege Sokarno and his accountant repeatedly refused to provide this information, despite multiple email requests sent over the span of several years, which have been seen by SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe joint venture partnership agreements \u2014 also seen by SBS News \u2014 contain several provisions giving investors the right to access bank accounts.\n\n\n\nSokarno says he had \"made efforts to ensure transparency in accordance with those agreements\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, any specific requests for access were either addressed directly or pending clarification, particularly where banking or legal protocols required additional steps or third-party cooperation,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there were delays or issues in providing access, they were not intentional.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Westpac, the bank at which the accounts were set up, raised issues with him relating to its 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations, particularly relating to some investors of Iranian nationality or origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These requirements were outside of my control and applied to multiple investors \u2026 I am in the process of gathering documentary evidence from the relevant financial institutions that reflect these compliance-related issues and access restrictions,\" Sokarno says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has not been provided with evidence to suggest the bank raised these issues, and multiple investors have confirmed they never received any documentation regarding this matter either. Westpac declined to comment on the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nMohammadi then advised Sokarno in April 2023 that he wanted to cancel his investment in the project.\n\n\n\nAmir Mohammadi suspects Ahmed Sokarno \"wouldn't dare to do this with an Australian citizen, because the law would have supported them, but our visa was temporary, and we didn't know about Australian law\". Source: Supplied Mohammadi was advised by Sokarno's lawyer in May that he could recoup his money \u2014 minus $86,237 Sokarno had deducted for expenses \u2014 if either party found a replacement investor for the joint company.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, his money has still not been returned.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Sokarno, the reasoning behind his request to find a replacement investor is \"to maintain the financial stability of the project and avoid jeopardising commitments already made on behalf\" of the joint company.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says multiple other provisions within the agreement \"support the position that the return of funds is not unconditional or automatic\", and other factors, such as \"tax and accounting implications\", also affected the return of the funds.\n\n\n\n'We are trapped'\n\nUnlike other Iranian investors interviewed by SBS News, Shams and Kaaranjaam paid the full investment amount before coming to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey had been pressuring Sokarno to buy a block of land since mid-2020, Shams says, and the process finally started in February 2022, a month before Shams and Kaaranjaam's arrival in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nA statement of account seen by SBS News shows the joint company set up with Sokarno, Deniz Care, settled the land for $435,416 in June 2022, with around half the money paid upfront and half borrowed.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the delays in generating revenue, Sokarno employed Shams as a community engagement manager and Kaaranjaam as an administration manager for Auscare, but Shams says they were never paid for their almost four months of work.\n\n\n\nAhmed Sokarno, Zainab Kaaranjaam and Saadegh Shams Haaeri outside the block of land bought for their planned SDA property in the north-west Melbourne suburb of Melton. Source: Supplied \"I started to become suspicious about it,\" Shams says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Sokarno] was not paying anything. He promised to give the revenue of Deniz Care, but he didn't.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following months, Shams asked for all the company's financial statements. He says the only thing he and Kaaranjaam ever received was an account summary showing a $357,000 balance, without a transaction history.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike other investors, he had long been suspicious of Sokarno's unwillingness to provide access to the company's bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every time he was giving me some excuses, I fully became sure that, 'Oh my God, we are trapped,'\" Shams says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I understood it was never going to become a good business for us for our permanent residency pathway.\n\n\n\nWe lost our money, we lost our time.\n\nDue to the resulting stress, Kaaranjaam was hospitalised in July 2022 after experiencing an anxiety attack.\n\n\n\nMelbourne's Melton-Bacchus Marsh area is possibly one of the \"epicentres of SDA market failure\", according to disability housing expert Joseph Connellan. Source: SBS News / Otis Filley The couple decided to pursue legal action against Sokarno in September of that year after delays in building the property and continued denial of access to bank records.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe land was ultimately repossessed by the lender in September 2024, as no repayments had been made. SBS News has seen documents that show the lender repeatedly sought payment from Sokarno for an outstanding amount of $227,500 for at least a year before the property's repossession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sokarno didn't even pay one instalment of the loan for purchasing the land. What does that mean?\" Shams says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSokarno has blamed the collapse on Shams and Kaaranjaam lodging a caveat on the property in February 2023, a legal instrument that protects equity and prevents the sale or transfer of a property without the involvement of the party who lodges the caveat (typically the buyer).\n\n\n\n\n\nSokarno says while he was \"fully prepared to commence construction\", the caveat prevented him \"from proceeding further with construction or refinancing\". It is worth noting that a caveat does not preclude loan repayments being made on the property in question, which is the reason the property was repossessed.\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by SBS News show the design for the property Saadegh Shams Haaeri and Zainab Kaaranjaam invested in received SDA approval on 9 May 2023. Source: Supplied \"In my view, the failure to bring the project to completion was due to their [Shams and Kaaranjaam's] voluntary withdrawal and subsequent legal actions, which created legal and financial barriers to progressing the development,\" Sokarno says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an email Sokarno sent to Shams in August 2022, there was an amount of $357,103 remaining in the joint company's bank account. In October 2023, via their solicitors, Shams and Kaaranjaam tried to compel Sokarno to use those remaining funds to settle the defaulted loan; however, no payments were made, and the money was never refunded.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to SBS News' questions, Sokarno says: \"The reason I did not return any remaining funds is that, to the best of my knowledge and financial records, there were no remaining funds available to return.\"\n\n\n\nA house has since been built on the site bought by Saadegh Shams Haaeri, Zainab Kaaranjaam and Auscare \u2014 and it's currently for sale.

Source: Supplied / SDA Alliance \"These bad actors frequently promote SDA as a 'guaranteed high-return' or 'NDIS-backed' investment, misusing official terms and logos in marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These claims are often deceptive or outright false. SDA is not a standard real estate product; it is a complex, regulated housing stream underpinned by human rights obligations and participant choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHope says his organisation is \"increasingly seeing international investors, particularly from Asia and the Middle East, being targeted through property expos, migration schemes, and online promotions\".\n\n\n\nSaadegh Shams Haaeri says that, since he lost faith in his SDA investment, he and his wife, Zainab Kaaranjaam, \"decided to focus on rebuilding our life wisely\".

The way the system works is, once a resident moves in, an SDA provider can bill their plan, and it's up to the SDA provider what their arrangement with the landlord is,\" he says.\n\n\n\nGoro Gupta says that, despite issues in the SDA system, \"it is thoroughly profitable and ethical if done right\".

For us at Australian Red Cross, we focus on psychological wellbeing of people impacted by disasters. Many other volunteer-led organisations involved in disaster response faced the same challenge we do. And any consideration of new volunteer-based workforce will need to need to consider sustainable sources of funding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has seen a long-term trend of decline in volunteerism, and it's showing no sign of slowing down, especially among younger people.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughly 90 per cent of fire and emergency service workers are volunteers, and experts say more will be needed as climate change worsens.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious incentives are being considered, like scholarships, expense re-imbursement, stipends, tax offsets, and reductions in student loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the kind of things that we need to have in the back pocket to lift this system, you're right ...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Webb is the CEO of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\".... those types of things, and I think that's where we can look over things and try and understand the best of. We need volunteers across every phase, but we'd have to support them and what you're suggesting there, ideas you're suggesting, are the types of things that we need to be looking at.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry is also examining how to build and acknowledge the skills and contribution of volunteers by creating a nationally recognised qualifications system.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the chief officer of the South Australian Country Fire Service, Brett Loughlin, emphasised the importance of balancing volunteering with an existing job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some kind of scheme that the Commonwealth can offer to be able to guarantee and mandate leave for emergency service volunteers is something that would be, I think, of great interest nationally. But also, how do you recognize those small business employers who are employing our volunteers? And how do they release their volunteers to go out and make a contribution, without financially disincentivised - as they are now - is something else that I would encourage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not the first time the volunteer system - and how it applies to disaster preparedness, emergency response, and long-term recovery - has been examined.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Royal Commission and Senate Select Committee have previously looked at the issue, and there's also already a National Strategy for Volunteering.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the CEO at Volunteering Australia, Mark Pearce, says there's still a significant gap in national oversight and coordination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Australian government must play a vital role with the volunteering ecosystem, acting as an essential enabler of policies that support volunteering, and the national strategy for volunteering. The first three year action plan of the national strategy for volunteering includes the development of a national volunteer passport, a platform to boost volunteer mobility, reduce barriers to participation and enhance planning through better data collection. Volunteering Australia has called on the government to progress this initiative over several years. However, progress on this initiative has stalled.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts who gave evidence at the Senate inquiry's public hearing also warned of duplication with states, which typically manage the response to natural disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legal work health and safety requirements that come with volunteer employees also present significant issues, as do declining populations in rural and regional areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, these challenges have led to an over-reliance on the Australian defence force during natural disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisaster Relief Australia is one organisation that has started harnessing veterans to help.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Smith is their CEO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now if you look at a picture of one of our volunteers with a community member, and they're giving them a hug, who's actually benefiting from this? Who's actually getting the most out of this? And a lot of our veterans, particularly, find benefit in that engagement with community members, because the work helps them adjust, to transition, to feel as though their previous experience is of benefit to the community more broadly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBacked by federal funding, his organisation has bucked the trend, increasing its volunteer base to almost 6,000 since it was founded in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as the broader decline continues, the inquiry highlights the need to raise a so-called volunteer army - especially among younger people.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "New data has revealed where Australians are planning on travelling these spring school holidays and the biggest barriers to making vacation plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tourism and Transport Forum (TFF) has released its survey about travel plans over spring, with 67 per cent of Australians planning to travel between 15 September and 31 October this year \u2014 either domestically or overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat number is down slightly from the same time last year when 71 per cent of people reported plans to travel.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the people planning to travel over the school holidays, 11 per cent are heading overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cInternationally we\u2019ve seen a bit of a shake-up. New Zealand has jumped into the number one spot, overtaking Europe, which was most popular during the winter holidays just passed,\" Margy Osmond, CEO of TFF, told SBS News.\n\n\n\nOsmond said New Zealand is a top international destination because it presents the \"perfect balance\" for Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Close, familiar, and offering that international holiday feel at a fraction of the cost of a long-haul trip,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nHolidays to Europe have already proved popular this year. In July, ANZ projected its customers would spend $280 million travelling to Europe across winter based on trends in hotel and airline bookings \u2014 a 10 per cent increase compared to 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor domestic travellers, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are the top cities for holidaymakers and the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, NSW's south coast and Victoria's Mornington Peninsula are the most popular regional destinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Something like 35 per cent of people will be staying within their own home state, and a lot of them will be having a staycation. So they might be staying at home with the kids and going out and exploring their own terrific home city, and having those kinds of experiences,\" Osmond said.\n\n\n\nThe biggest barriers\n\nHowever, cost is still the greatest barrier for Australians looking to travel, with 44 per cent of Australians citing it as their main obstacle to making plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Australian travellers] are feeling the pinch. ... There is no doubt that the cost of living is starting to have an impact. And people are perhaps going away for a little bit shorter and spending not quite so much,\" Osmond said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of travellers planned to spend under $5,000 on their holidays, including 41 per cent who were planning to spend less than $2,000 on their entire trip.\n\n\n\nClimate concerns are also front of mind for some, with people aged 25 to 34 years old most likely to cite extreme temperatures as a concern for travelling.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical considerations as a barrier for travel have also increased since last year, rising from 2 per cent to 6 per cent this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUncertainty in different parts of the world is certainly weighing on many Australians when they think about travel, and our data suggests this concern could become more pronounced over the next five years,\" Osmond said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat said, history shows Australians are rarely deterred from taking a holiday. Major sporting events, cultural attractions and festivals remain powerful drawcards, generally strong enough to outweigh broader political unease when it comes to choosing where to go.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dolnicar, Professor at the University of Queensland's Business School, told SBS News earlier this year that a decline in interest in travelling to the US has been driven at least part due to political instability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know if it's specifically the Trump administration or whether it's the perceived volatility of decision-making, but there is absolutely no doubt that that has affected international travel into the US,\" Dolnicar said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australians won't be voting in a republic referendum as long as Anthony Albanese remains prime minister, with experts explaining there's currently \"no point\" to the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being a longtime advocate for an Australian republic, Albanese told SBS News he won't be pursuing the constitutional change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look, I've always supported an Australian as our head of state. But the existing arrangements are in place,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have, I think, a very respectful relationship and we have a monarch, His Majesty, who's passionate and interested about Australia, of world affairs, and the future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told Insiders, \"I think I've made it clear that I wanted to hold one referendum while I was prime minister, and we did that\", referring to the 2023 referendum to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which nearly 60 per cent of Australians rejected.\n\n\n\n\"We're concentrating on cost of living and on making a real, practical difference to people's lives,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe revelation is at odds with the Australian Labor Party's policy platform, which outlines \"work toward establishing an Australian republic with an Australian head of state\" as part of its objectives to modernise the constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut experts agree Albanese has made the right call. And here's why.\n\n\n\n'No political gain' in referendum\n\nFormer Labor adviser Bruce Hawker said there is \"no point\" in holding a referendum without bipartisan support.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe noted that of the 44 referendum questions to date, backing from both major parties was critical to the eight that resulted in constitutional change .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So that means, effectively, that unless you do have that support, you're really just wasting taxpayers' money,\" Hawker told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe suggests Labor should not have gone ahead with the Voice referendum once it became clear that the Coalition was going to oppose it.\n\n\n\nWhile the Coalition backed the idea of constitutional recognition for Australia's First Nations people, it did not support doing this through the establishment of a Voice to Parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think at that point it probably was worthwhile seriously considering abandoning the Voice referendum for that very reason, that once you lose bipartisan support, it's almost impossible to guarantee support by the public of Australia,\" Hawker said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese's personal advocacy for a republic also appeared to wane during a 2024 cabinet reshuffle, during which the government scrapped the portfolio of the country's first Assistant Minister for the Republic, Matt Thistlethwaite.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Williams, a political scientist at Griffith University, agrees that the recent referendum took \"a lot of personal bark\" off Albanese, which has taken Labor \"a long time to recover\" from.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it's political capital the prime minister is not willing to squander, with \"no political gain\" from another referendum, especially amid longer-term aspirations.\n\n\n\n\"It's almost certain he'll win the next election in 2028 and he may be eyeing up a term after that to become one of the great, longest-serving Labor prime ministers. That's his plan,\" Williams told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He doesn't want to endanger any of that by losing any unnecessary political capital. He's got big enough problems to solve in terms of tax reform, in terms of housing reform and those sort of bread and butter issues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams said the niche issue was not worth turning off voters, or worse, providing the Coalition with ammunition to claim that Albanese is focused on issues that don't matter.\n\n\n\nDo voters support a republic?\n\nA YouGov poll of 1,500 voters in November 2024, marking 25 years since the Republic referendum failed, found 59 per cent of Australians would reject the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found that voting intention for a republic was 4 percentage points lower than in 1999, with 41 per cent of Australians supporting a republic.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the data, Esther Anatolitis, co-chair of the Australian Republic Movement, said it was a surprising move, given Albanese's long-term advocacy for a republic, and insisted there was growing support.\n\n\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth II led to a resurgence of support for the constitutional monarchy in Australia.

We've got people who are really, really interested in that everyday conversation about Australian democratic reform,\" Anatolitis told the ABC.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Flint, national convener of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, said the call rightly \"reflects a realism that there's no great interest or passion in Australia [for change]\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nobody's ever had somebody at the ministerial level, a minister of the crown, actually working to remove the crown. But [Albanese] had that for a while,\" Flint said, referring to Thistlethwaite's previous republic portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think [the prime minister's] realised that's a dead end, and he's got much more relevant things to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams notes the constitutional monarchy has seen an uptick in support since the accession of King Charles, as well as other events such as the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the wedding of Prince William and Princess Kate .\n\n\n\nConcluding that there's clearly \"no appetite for Australia to become a republic anytime soon\", Williams said support is more likely for a referendum that impacts voters in a meaningful way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Will it improve my life? Will it get me a pay rise? Will it get me, give my children a house? Those are the sorts of questions a lot of Australians would ask,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And of course, the answer is no.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker agrees that unless the republican movement can demonstrate how the lives of voters will change materially as a result of becoming a republic, it'll be a \"long time before the Australian public is going to go down the path of supporting a referendum along those lines\".\n\n\n\n",

That game at Manly, it was good to go through that as a group. It highlighted some key areas that we were pretty poor at. I think we needed that to wake us up a little bit.\u201d Ezra Mam\u2019s try celebration was met with a chorus of boos by Manly fans. Credit: NRL Imagery That disastrous Sea Eagles loss was Brisbane at their worst. Commitment to the cause was hard to spot. Five-eighth Ezra Mam was booed with every touch in response to his perceived light punishment for a drug driving incident that left three people injured. A clumsy post-game interview from the five-eighth didn\u2019t help. Talk of player burnout under Maguire\u2019s polarising training methods gathered momentum. Especially given the knives were already out after the cut-throat way his predecessor Kevin Walters, a most popular figure with media heavy hitters and Broncos old boys, was rolled to make way.\n\nDressing room footage was analysed. CEO Dave Donaghy and chairman Karl Morris were put on blast, and leaders Reynolds and Kotoni Staggs were openly questioned about player revolt. \u201cExternally, all that chat was pretty big and hard to ignore,\u201d hooker Corey Paix says. Broncos coach Michael Maguire and Adam Reynolds. Credit: NRL Imagery \u201cBut we did because we were having the proper conversations, those very hard, very honest chats ourselves. \u201cAs a group, we ended up demanding commitment from one another because the coaches can say and do as much as possible, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s up to the players to turn it around.\n\n\u201cWe went back to work, trained harder, got in and did what we needed to. Looking back, that really was our turning point.\u201d When Brisbane emerged at the end of a long week, they ran onto Suncorp Stadium resembling the All Blacks in what is now an iconic, completely black kit as part of the club\u2019s mental health round and charity partnership with the Black Dog Institute. A 44-14 blitz of the Titans was Brisbane at their all-running, all-attacking best, just seven days after bottoming out at Brookvale. In 14 games since, they\u2019ve lost only twice - including a 22-2 defeat in Melbourne where Reynolds, Mam and Selwyn Cobbo all tore their hamstrings and their season was apparently gone.\n\nThe graft and grind their coach prizes above all else was plain to see in running down Penrith from 14-0, defending their goal line like demons all the while. Loading And as for Maguire\u2019s much-discussed intensity, methods, and a little madness, back-rower Jordan Riki can only laugh now. Along with Reynolds and prop Payne Haas, the Kiwi international\u2019s prior experience of Brisbane\u2019s new coach was eagerly, and at times apprehensively, mined by his teammates. For anyone who\u2019s had their fingers crushed in one of Maguire\u2019s vice-like handshakes - \u201cand he\u2019s got this big grin on his face when he does it\u201d Riki laughs - it\u2019s as good an indication as any of what you\u2019re in for. \u201cThere is a bit of an aura about him, you know, when he steps into a room that he needs everybody\u2019s attention and he needs you locked in and focused,\u201d Riki says.",

Nick Daicos had another superb season, capped with his second-straight runner-up finish in the Brownlow Medal count. Is there a better kick in the league? Brother Josh provided drive from half-back, while ruckman Darcy Cameron had a career year.\n\nSteele Sidebottom and Jack Crisp were consistent contributors, Jamie Elliott booted a team-high 60 goals, while former Giant Harry Perryman settled in well across half-back. Ned Long had a break-out year, while Scott Pendlebury, 37, defied his age until he was stopped by a calf strain in the opening minutes of the preliminary final. The AFL games record will be his in 2026 if he plays the eight more games needed to go past Brent Harvey on 432. It could be a rough exit meeting for: More than one Magpie, and even for the Magpies\u2019 list managers, for Elliott, 33, may need to be dissuaded from joining the Gold Coast Suns on a three-year deal, while Brody Mihocek, 32, has a three-year offer from Melbourne to consider. The Magpies, however, may tell Mihocek they won\u2019t budge from their two-year offer. Mason Cox, 34, faces an uncertain future, while Dan Houston \u2013 and the Pies \u2013 will agree they need more from him next season. Bobby Hill, having missed so much football because of personal issues, remains a close watch.\n\nSomething to look forward to: Houston was not the same counter-puncher he was at Port Adelaide in his first year with the Magpies \u2013 expect that to change next year. He is exemplary with ball in hand, and needs to have more of it. Skipper Darcy Moore had an indifferent season, and may need to revisit the balance between pure defending and hunting the ball. Get that right, and the Magpies \u2013 already built on defence \u2013 will be even stronger. Coach Craig McRae wants a blend of good draft picks and established players through this trade/draft period. They missed out on Jack Silvagni, but will trade for Swans\u2019 forward Jack Buller. Another established defender may be front of mind, for Jeremy Howe, 35, is showing signs of wear and tear. Predicted best and fairest: Nick Daicos.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nAdelaide (fifth after finals loss) Wins: 18 Losses: 7 Draft picks: 18, 41, 48, 54, 66, 72. What went well: There was much to like. The Crows not only leapt back into the finals for the first time since 2017, but won 12 of their final 13 home-and-away games to finish as minor premier.\n\nMatthews Nicks\u2019 game plan, essentially built on going long down the line, held up during the season proper. Taylor Walker may not like what he hears from the Crows\u2019 bosses in his end-of-season meeting. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Skipper Jordan Dawson and full-forward Riley Thilthorpe were All-Australians, while fellow forwards Taylor Walker and Darcy Fogarty, and forward-midfielder Ben Keays, also enjoyed strong home-and-away seasons. Former Demon Alex Neal-Bullen was a fine acquisition, and could be a future skipper. Izak Rankine provided creativity up field and close to goal, and was badly missed through suspension for a homophobic slur in September. \u201cWhat it did do was it changed the dynamic of our group,\u201d Nicks said of Rankine\u2019s absence. \u201cIzak is, and this is my opinion, one of the best players in the game, so I think if any team loses their best player, then it becomes quite challenging to replace that.\u201d It could be a rough exit meeting for: Taylor Walker. The champion forward, 35, is off contract, and his time may be up after a modest finals campaign. The Crows may feel Thilthorpe and Fogarty need to be empowered and shoulder greater responsibility. Fellow veteran Brodie Smith, 33, is also weighing up his future.\n\nSomething to look forward to: This was a year when the Crows built a foundation for what should be a five-year premiership tilt. Yes, they failed to win a quarter in their two finals defeats, becoming the first minor premiers in more than 40 years to be dumped from September in straight sets, but that sting should fire this squad. However, they do have holes. While unbeaten in 13 games against bottom nine teams, they were 6-7 against top nine teams, their scoring and defence dropping off. They need another X-factor in addition to Rankine, while a forward line of three talls didn\u2019t hold-up in September, when the ball is on the ground more. Another strong defender would also help. Nicks will need to tinker with his game plan. As he said after the semi-final loss to Hawthorn, it\u2019s harder to move the ball the way you want in the finals when the intensity rises. The Crows have been linked with off-contract Lions forward Callum Ah Chee.\n\n\n\nBest and fairest tip: Jordan Dawson.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Suns gun Matt Rowell takes a physical battering in every game he plays. Credit: Getty Images Gold Coast (sixth after finals loss) Wins: 16 Losses: 9 Draft picks 6, 14, 15, 32, 56, 68 What went well: The Suns have finally risen. This was a breakthrough season for a club, which not only made its maiden finals run in its 15th attempt, but conjured a miraculous win over the Dockers in Perth.\n\nSkipper Noah Anderson and fellow midfielder Matt Rowell were first-time All-Australians, their sustained efforts in the midfield a sight to behold. The physical punishment Rowell takes reminds us of the hits an NFL running back endures. Marking forward Ben King was superb in front of goal but will need to add a new trick or two. Fellow forward Ben Long had a breakout campaign, although he was disappointing in the semi-final, while recruits Daniel Rioli and John Noble delivered what was expected of them at half-back. Sam Collins is a beast at full-back, Touk Miller delivered run and carry, while Bailey Humphrey showed signs of morphing into the Suns\u2019 version of Cam Rayner. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Jed Walter. The young forward was dropped after round 19 and did not return to the side. While the former Suns academy product is contracted for next season, he could be used in a trade for Carlton\u2019s Charlie Curnow. While a star in the making, Mac Andrew will face a strong review of his finals performances.\n\nSomething to look forward to: There is plenty to look forward to with this emerging list, coach Damien Hardwick declaring his team is built for September. The base is there, it\u2019s now time to build internally and through canny trades. The Suns were too reliant on Rowell and Anderson, and need another robust midfielder who can deliver under pressure. The unicorn that is Ethan Read struggled in the semi-final but has the height and talent to be a long-term marking threat. They could lose Sam Flanders, who has two years remaining on his contract, and Malcolm Rosas, through the trade period. Best and fairest tip: Noah Anderson.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Fremantle (8th)\n\nWins: 16. Losses: 8. Draft picks 13, 31, 38, 49, 67. What went well: After last year\u2019s meltdown, when they slipped from the top eight at the start of August to 10th by the end, the Dockers held firm this year and returned to the finals for the first time since 2022, winning 12 of their last 14 games to finish sixth. Caleb Serong again starred in the Fremantle midfield. Credit: AFL Photos They adopted a more attacking gameplan after five losses from their first nine games, but failed to fully embrace this mantra in a stinging elimination final defeat to the Suns. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown so much throughout the year with the way we play our footy, the way we embrace challenges, the way we\u2019ve improved our footy on the road,\u201d coach Justin Longmuir said after the loss to the Suns.\n\nMarking talls Josh Treacy (44 goals) and Patrick Voss (37) had strong seasons, while Murphy Reid claimed the AFLPA\u2019s best young player award. Former premiership Tiger Shai Bolton (28) was arguably the recruit of the year. Defender Jordan Clark and midfield stud Caleb Serong were All-Australians, while Andrew Brayshaw was unlucky not to be. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Jye Amiss. While he played all 24 games, Amiss, a key marking tall, returned a modest 32 goals, and averaged career-lows in marks and disposals per game. He had only two touches (one goal) in the elimination final before being subbed off. Amiss could be a trade target. Then there\u2019s ruckman Sean Darcy. Will he and Luke Jackson continue to be a one-two punch in the ruck? We\u2019ll see.\n\nSomething to look forward to: The Dockers are building nicely. They had an average age of just 24.9 years through the season \u2013 the fourth youngest in the competition. Fremantle ruckman Sean Darcy. Credit: AFL Photos AFL great James Hird has set high expectations for them next year, despite their loss to the Suns on Saturday. \u201cI think they have to be top four next year with their list and the way they\u2019ve had the final this year and the performances against the best teams in the competition. I\u2019ve really gotten locked in that top four next year,\u201d Hird said. But they cannot afford to have lulls and slip back into a defensive mindset when the pressure is at its greatest. This will be Longmuir\u2019s greatest challenge.\n\nBest and fairest: Caleb Serong.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik GWS (7th) Wins: 16. Losses: 8. Draft picks: 12, 30, 36. What went well: After a dodgy first half of the year, the Giants won nine of their last 10 home-and-away games, scoring more than 100 points in each of them. In the end, they finished with one of the AFL\u2019s best attacking records, just two points behind third place.\n\nToby Greene and his Giants were eliminated at home by the Hawks. Credit: AFL Photos At their best, they were absolutely awe-inspiring: their stunning third quarters against the Swans in the second Sydney derby of the season, plus their (eventually unsuccessful) comeback against Hawthorn in their elimination final, will live long in the memory. The challenge will be closing the gap between their frightening best and their timid worst. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Everyone. The Giants have now lost their past four finals, including two at home (and three in Sydney) \u2013 the sort of record that each player needs to take a varying degree of responsibility for, as well as the coaching group, and will require them all to look deeply within over the summer. September stumbles are becoming too much of a theme. What\u2019s clear is that they concede too many entries, which can\u2019t be wholly pinned on the six poor blokes in defence who had to deal with that avalanche. All things considered, they managed OK, but it felt unsustainable, and so it has proved. And there\u2019s a similar problem going the other way. When they\u2019re on, they\u2019re on, but the Giants\u2019 attack falls to pieces when they mindlessly blaze away inside 50 as they did against Hawthorn, which completely undermines their forward set-up. Composure in key moments is lacking in this side across every line, and that\u2019s not an easy thing to add.\n\nSam Taylor is a star defender for GWS, but the Giants\u2019 defensive unit is under pressure. Credit: AFL Photos Something to look forward to: As Adam Kingsley said post-match, the Giants still have \u201call the pieces\u201d to contend, although their ageing stars are running out of petrol. But the window remains open, their next tier of rising stars will be better with another season under their belts and if they can address their inconsistencies, get to the psychological nub of their finals failures and have some better luck with injuries, there\u2019s no reason why they won\u2019t be back contending again in 2026. Best and fairest tip: Finn Callaghan showed exactly why St Kilda threw a $17 million, 10-year contract offer at him; thank heavens he said no. He and Tom Green (likely second in the best and fairest) run this team now.\n\n\u2013 Vince Rugari Western Bulldogs (9th)\n\nWins: 14. Losses: 9. Draft picks: 10, 28 What went well: Offensive power. The Doggies poured on the goals this season, scoring more points (2493) than any other team. Led by Marcus Bontempelli, Tom Liberatore, Ed Richards and an increasingly influential Sam Darcy up forward, they beat up teams with regularity. While that resulted in a 14-9 record, the team from the west missed the finals. The Bulldogs were an offensive juggernaut in 2025 but still missed finals. Credit: Getty Images It could be a rough exit meeting for: Jamarra Ugle-Hagan. The one-time No.1 draft pick has occupied so much of the Bulldogs top brass\u2019 time this season. It would be fascinating to witness his official exit meeting given there\u2019s so much to discuss for a player who didn\u2019t add to his tally of 67 AFL games this season. Defenders will be in the spotlight, too, but each player on the list will be pressed for explanations as to why the Dogs simply couldn\u2019t beat teams who were vying for finals spots.\n\nSomething to look forward to: Plenty, to be truthful. The Dogs have recorded 14 wins in consecutive seasons; in 2024 they played finals, so they can\u2019t wallow in pity about what happened this year. Jamarra Ugle-Hagan didn\u2019t play a game for the Bulldogs this season. Credit: Justin McManus Darcy, at age 22, remains one of the most exciting young players in the game. Aaron Naughton\u2019s best season (65 goals) is a beacon of hope for even better things, too. Best and fairest tip: I\u2019ve landed on Ed Richards ahead of Tom Liberatore. Bontempelli\u2019s missed games through injury will cost him.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits Port Adelaide (13th)\n\nWins: 8. Losses: 15. Draft picks: 26, 42, 60 What went well: That\u2019s tough to answer because this was an extremely disappointing year, despite Ken Hinkley\u2019s protestations the list is set up well for 2026. Port Adelaide chairman David Koch stuck with Ken Hinkley to the end. Credit: Getty Images Having made a preliminary final last year, the Power slipped markedly. However, skipper Connor Rozee and fellow star midfielder Zak Butters were typically industrious, while forward Mitch Georgiades delivered a half-century of goals for the first time. Aliir Aliir enjoyed another stellar season in defence, while Travis Boak and Hinkley were given a classy send-off against the Suns, the victory fully deserved. Zak Butters won Port Adelaide\u2019s best and fairest award - the John Cahill Medal - for the third consecutive year in 2025. Credit: Getty Images\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: President David Koch and his board. The succession plan designed to ease Hinkley out and Josh Carr to prepare for the senior role next season was done with the best of intentions, but the scoreboard says it was a failure. If Hinkley wasn\u2019t the man to take the team forward, then Carr should have been immediately installed, and Hinkley given a thank-you payout for his years of fine service. Something to look forward to: The Power should be back in the finals hunt next year, but they will need to get busy in the trade period. Do they have enough true stars? Missing out on Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera will hurt.\n\nLate season injuries have given the youngsters a chance. We like what we have seen of Jack Whitlock, who can play ruck and go forward. Best and fairest winner: Zak Butters.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Essendon (15th)\n\nWins: 6. Losses: 17. Draft picks: 4, 5, 22, 25. What went well: The Bombers have some superb youngsters. In his second year, Nate Caddy again gave glimpses of the player he could become, with 20 goals and more flashes of brilliance.\n\nIsaac Kako gave Bombers fans something to get excited about. Credit: AFL Photos Isaac Kako impressed with his smarts around goals and showed late in the season he can also be developed as a pinch-hitter in the centre square. Archie Roberts, the lowest draft pick of the trio, could end up being a steal. The teenager is advanced beyond his years, demonstrating composure and skill in a defence that was under siege. Angus Clarke is another of the club\u2019s 15 debutants this year who has provided Bombers fans with hope in a wretched campaign.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Ben Hobbs. In his fourth season, Hobbs, 21, failed to take a more significant role in the side. Worryingly for Hobbs, despite Essendon\u2019s litany of injuries, he was dropped for the first leg of the final round and could not break back into the team. Hobbs has stagnated in his past two seasons, reaching 20 disposals in just three of his past 30 games. His disposal remains a worry. If time has run out for the first-round pick from the 2021 draft, it would raise further queries on the Bombers\u2019 recruiting and player development. Something to look forward to: The draft. The Bombers have a strong hand in this year\u2019s draft after acquiring Melbourne\u2019s first selection through a pick swap last year. Even accounting for father/son, academy and NGA picks, the Bombers should have access to two very good youngsters. If Sam Draper departs through free agency, that should deliver another first-round pick. Unfortunately for the Dons, this is not considered the strongest draft, but one experienced recruiter has said they would not be surprised if smokies emerge deeper in the pool.\n\nBest and fairest: Zach Merrett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu West Coast (18th) Wins: 1. Losses: 22. Draft picks: 1, 14, 19, 32, 50. What went well: Sorry West Coast fans, this is not pretty. The Eagles have managed 11 wins in four seasons, including just one victory, over St Kilda, in a torturous 2025 season.\n\nBut there\u2019s always a glimmer of hope and performances and players to celebrate. Two-time Richmond premiership player Jack Graham, who joined the Eagles for 2025, comfortably exceeded his career average for disposals (19.2 possessions per game this season) and had 7.8 tackles per game (which is considered \u201celite\u201d). It could be a rough exit meeting for: The defensive unit and the defence coaches. West Coast comfortably conceded the highest number of points (2438) this season, leaving them with a limp percentage of 60.1. If premierships are built from the backline, they need to focus there. It will be fascinating to see the club\u2019s attitude towards Tim Kelly, who played 19 games in his sixth season with the Eagles. Something to look forward to: It couldn\u2019t get any worse, could it? If West Coast haven\u2019t bottomed out, where is the bottom?\n\nThe Eagles can expect the No.2 draft pick as compensation for losing free agent Oscar Allen to Brisbane, so that\u2019s something. And Harley Reid is staying for now, having resisted interest from big Victorian clubs to extend until the end of 2028. Eagles fans can only look forward to better times ahead. Best and fairest tip: Jack Graham.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits North Melbourne (16th)\n\nWins: 5 Losses: 17 Draws: 1 Draft picks: 20, 21, 39, 57 What went well: They made it out of the bottom two! The Kangaroos and coach Alastair Clarkson would have liked to see more progress on the ladder, but he remains bullish they are heading in the right direction. North Melbourne avoided another bottom-two finish. Credit: Getty Images After a torrid first six rounds and the odd thrashing beyond that, North were generally more competitive, including securing a draw with Brisbane, but there were no statement wins. Instead, they would be pleased with Harry Sheezel\u2019s transition to a midfield-forward role, the continued development of Colby McKercher and career-best seasons from Cam Zurhaar and Paul Curtis.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Will Phillips. The No.3 pick in the COVID-19-impacted 2020 draft class played only seven matches this season and does not appear to be in the Roos\u2019 plans. He should latch on somewhere, but needs to get going to save his career. Something to look forward to: Next year promises to be the season when North Melbourne finally take a genuine leap. How high that is remains to be seen, but the expectations must rise, even if that is as modest as aiming for between eight and 10 wins. The young talent is there, and they may have finally found Nick Larkey\u2019s sidekick in Cooper Trembath. A stiffer defence and another progression from their midfield group should enable them to take another belated step.\n\nBest and fairest: Luke Davies-Uniacke.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan Richmond (17th) Wins: 5. Losses: 18. Draft picks: 2,3 What went well: Plenty for a club that was widely tipped to sail through turbulent waters with a drastically young and inexperienced list.\n\nThe season began on the best note possible with a stunning round-one win over Carlton. The nature of the victory, a come-from-behind triumph, set the tone for the season for both the Tigers and Blues. Throw in highlights from Maurice Rioli jnr, and all was swell. Tim Taranto had a strong season as one of the Tigers\u2019 on-field leaders. Credit: AFL Photos It could be a rough exit meeting for: The club\u2019s forwards and the forward coaches. The Tigers scored the fewest number of points (1449), less even than West Coast, a club that limped to one victory, compared to Richmond\u2019s five. Veteran spearhead Tom Lynch could cop a drive-by sledge for missing games. He played only 16 matches (due largely to a suspension) after a tough couple of years with injuries.\n\nSomething to look forward to: There\u2019s so much to look forward to. Realistically, the Tigers will battle to replicate their win-loss tally (5-18) as they continue to develop their young group. It could be a case of the \u201csecond-year blues\u201d for a host of players. But Richmond will be eyeing off their matches against Carlton and the chance to knock them off again. Best and fairest tip: Tim Taranto.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits St Kilda (12th)\n\nWins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 7, 43, 58. What went well: The Saints were a popular choice to sink into the bottom four, but finished three wins clear of that territory while prioritising youth. The Saints will welcome Tom De Koning in 2026 and welcome back Max King after another injury-riddled season. Credit: AFL Photos St Kilda\u2019s round two upset of Geelong was a false dawn, but a peek at their upside. They also demolished Fremantle and executed the greatest three-quarter-time comeback from 46 points down against Melbourne. That latter win was the first of four in a row before they almost upset GWS in round 24.\n\nNasiah Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s emergence as a top-liner was massive, while Max Hall followed Cooper Sharman and Max Heath as a mid-season draft success story. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Zak Jones. The brother of ex-Demons captain Nathan was not one of the five Saints who re-signed last week, and faces an uncertain future. Jones turns 31 in March, and St Kilda already made it clear they want to get younger in the midfield. Something to look forward to: Another two years from Wanganeen-Milera, who they retained despite Adelaide and Port Adelaide wanting him.\n\nThere is optimism about what Mattaes Phillipou, Darcy Wilson, Alix Tauru and Tobie Travaglia can become, while the likes of Hugo Garcia, Isaac Keeler, Hugh Boxshall and Lance Collard also show promise. Tom De Koning will be on the list in 2026, and Max King will hopefully be fit again. Best and fairest tip: Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan Sydney (10th) Wins: 12. Losses: 11. Draft picks: 9, 27, 45, 63. What went well: Having won just four of their first 12 games under new coach Dean Cox, the Swans showed fortitude to rebound and win eight of their final 11 games.\n\nBrodie Grundy returned to his best form for Sydney in 2025. Credit: AFL Photos Playmaker Isaac Heeney had a tough start, but then reminded everyone why he is a legitimate star. Chad Warner was a consistent threat through the midfield, but did not have the impact he enjoyed through 2022-24. A serious ankle injury through the pre-season sidelined Errol Gulden for months and seriously hurt the Swans\u2019 midfield and creative drive, just as his return in round 15 had the reverse effect. Brodie Grundy reinforced why he is one of the competition\u2019s premier ruckmen.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Skipper Callum Mills. For the Swans to make the leap next season, Mills needs to consistently be on the park. His 2024 campaign was derailed after injuring his rotator cuff in a Mad Monday celebration. He missed the first half of this year because of plantar fascia. He needs to lead the way in 2026. Something to look forward to: This has been a year of recalibration for the Swans, and learning, particularly for Cox, who is now more at ease in the top role after replacing John Longmire. While it feels somewhat of a wasted year, the Swans are still in top-four mode, and are likely to be strengthened through the trade period. They just need to get moving earlier next season. Best and fairest tip: Isaac Heeney.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nCarlton (11th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 34, 44, 62*. What went well: Not much. George Hewett was one of few Blues to exceed expectations, putting together a career-best season in the midfield. Jack Silvagni and Tom De Koning are both leaving the Blues. Credit: Getty Images Better known as a defensive onballer, Hewett became a prolific ball-winner in his own right. In his 12th season on an AFL list, the former Swan is a strong chance to win his first best and fairest award.\n\nVeteran Nick Haynes overcame a horror start at the club to become dependable defender. He deserves another year. Young midfielder Cooper Lord is one to watch. George Hewett stepped up for the Blues in 2025, but didn\u2019t get enough support. Credit: Getty Images The Blues blooded seven debutants, the best of whom looks to be key defender Harry O\u2019Farrell, who, unfortunately, injured his knee. Other gains were bitter-sweet. Jack Silvagni was a revelation in defence but played just 13 games and is now on the move. Ollie Hollands found plenty of the ball in his new role as a running defender but his kicking needs work. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Mitch McGovern. The Blues are keen to get money off their books and the writing is on the wall for the 30-year-old, who narrowly missed a games trigger that would have earned a contract extension.\n\nWith Silvagni walking out and O\u2019Farrell to be unsighted for much of 2026, the defender may yet get another year, but it will be on the Blues\u2019 terms. Veterans Adam Saad and Blake Acres both had ordinary seasons. Something to look forward to: With mass change underway in the coaches box, free agents Tom De Koning and Silvagni confirming their departures, and ongoing chatter about Charlie Curnow, it\u2019s already been a turbulent off-season for the Blues, and the AFL home and away season isn\u2019t even officially over yet! Expect that turmoil to continue for some time yet. But once they ride that out, there will be hope again. The departures of De Koning and Silvagni will strengthen the Blues\u2019 draft hand to acquire highly-rated Harry Dean as a father-son pick.\n\nDecimated by injury in 2025, the Blues can vault back into finals contention with a cleaner bill of health. Curnow (assuming he stays) and Sam Walsh had interrupted preseasons which severely impacted their year. Harry McKay missed half the season. Matthew Cottrell and Elijah Hollands, two of their best runners, hardly played, and heart-and-soul defender Nic Newman didn\u2019t get on the field at all. Then there\u2019s the prospect of a fit Jagga Smith. Get all them right and the Blues should be stronger \u2013 but this was a year when they fell well below expectations. Best and fairest tip: George Hewett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu\n\nMelbourne (14th) Wins: 7. Losses: 16. Draft picks: 23, 51, 59* What went well: Kysaiah Pickett graduated from a star goalsneak to a game-breaking midfielder/forward who now rivals skipper Max Gawn as the club\u2019s best player. Despite their troubles, the Demons secured Pickett\u2019s prized signature in a huge coup, keeping him in the red and the blue until the end of 2034 on a lucrative contract. Midfielders Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver are stars for Melbourne and both have long-term contracts, but that no longer means their respective futures at the club are guaranteed. Credit: Getty Images Gawn was again a colossus, talking through action on the field and becoming their spokesperson for almost every crisis off it.\n\nRebounding defender Jake Bowey has taken the next step to become a driver of the team while Harvey Langford, the No.6 pick in last year\u2019s draft, is the Demons\u2019 next A-grade midfielder after making a seamless transition to senior football. Veteran forward Jake Melksham, with 33 goals from 18 games, earned himself another contract, which was confirmed by the Demons just days after their season ended. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Clayton Oliver and Christian Petracca. Do two of Melbourne\u2019s greatest players want to stay? If either player wants out, the club should not stand in their way.\n\nComing back from a life-threatening injury, Petracca\u2019s season was steady, and he will likely finish in the top six of the club\u2019s best and fairest award, but a long way from his game-breaking ways. Loading Oliver was better than last year when his campaign was compromised by his off-field issues. Both still have time to return to their best but the competition trend away from contest and stoppage towards speed and ball use is against them. Jacob van Rooyen went backwards in a season the club needed him to hold down a key forward posting.",

    "text": "Every few years, the concept of fasted exercise training pops up all over social media.\n\nFasted training refers to exercising in the morning, before eating breakfast.\n\nFans will claim it\u2019s the most efficient way to lose body fat. Opponents say it\u2019s a terrible idea and will cause you to gain weight.\n\nWho\u2019s right and what does the research evidence say?\n\nWhere did the idea come from?\n\nFasted exercise, proponents say, will cause better changes in body composition \u2013 the proportion of lean mass (muscle), bone and fat. In particular, they say fasted exercise leads to fat loss.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPositive changes in body composition can occur through losses of fat mass, while either maintaining or gaining lean mass. Or even through gaining lean mass in the absence of any loss of body fat. All of which may be considered positive.\n\nThe idea fasted exercises leads to such positive body composition changes stems from research that shows exercising after eating versus exercise before eating affects metabolism differently.\n\nAerobic exercise in a fasted state causes you to burn more fat as a fuel (what researchers would call \u201cfat oxidation\u201d) when measured at a single point in time.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t a big leap to assume this would translate to longer-term fat loss.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHowever, a 2017 systematic review from my team demonstrated that a fasted exercise training program doesn\u2019t seem to translate into long-term differences in body fat loss.\n\nThis discrepancy between fat burned as a fuel during exercise, and changes in body fat in the long term has often been misunderstood.\n\nThis apparent contradiction may come down to the fact the body seems to find ways to compensate. Fat burning seems to reduce once you eat, and people who have exercised hard may end up expending less total energy over the course of the day.\n\nIn exercise science, it\u2019s actually pretty common to find that short-term effects don\u2019t always translate to longer-term impacts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor example, intense short-term exercise can negatively affect your immune system in the moment, but doing regular exercise can actually affect it positively in the longer term.\n\nExercising after eating improves performance in activities lasting over 60 minutes.

A survey completed by almost 2,000 endurance athletes showed non-professional athletes are more likely to exercise fasted compared to professional athletes.\n\nWhat about strength training?\n\nSo do you get differences in muscle strength, size, and body composition changes in response to doing resistance training (such as weightlifting) when you\u2019ve fasted versus when you\u2019ve eaten? Unfortunately, the research is limited and low quality.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis limited evidence so far suggests it makes no difference.\n\nOne recent randomised controlled trial also found no difference in strength, power, or lean body mass when resistance training was done twice a week for 12 weeks either after fasting or after eating.\n\nWhat are the potential drawbacks?\n\nFasted training can make you feel really hungry after exercise, which can lead you to make poorer food choices.\n\nSome people may even get headaches and nausea when trying to exercise fasted. This isn\u2019t universal experience, though; social media is full of people who say exercising while fasting makes them feel great.\n\nIn summary, there is no clear winner.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe evidence doesn\u2019t support the superiority of fasted exercise for weight loss, or sports performance.\n\nHowever, the evidence also doesn\u2019t show it causes a problem in many scenarios (except perhaps elite sports performance).\n\nSo if you\u2019re short on time and skipping breakfast is going to allow you to get out and get that run or workout in, then go for it. Don\u2019t worry too much about the consequence.\n\nBut if the idea of exercising on an empty tummy makes you want to avoid the gym, then grab some breakfast before you go. Rest assured it won\u2019t be working against your goals.\n\nExercise fads and wellness hacks come and go but the thing backed by solid and consistent evidence is exercise.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSimply doing it matters the most.\n\nNot the time of day, not the exact exercise choice, not even the exact amount \u2013 and definitely, not if you have or haven\u2019t eaten before you exercise.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
