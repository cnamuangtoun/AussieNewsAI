There was also a very gratifying nomination of Amy Madigan for her turn as the villain in Weapons . Overall, most of the nominations closely tracked awards predictions.\n\nAlso, all the popular TV shows got nominated.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's film \"One Battle After Another\" led the awards charge. (AP)\n\nAs is the case every year, the Globes awards categories suffer from the insistence to categorise movies and television shows as either drama or as \"musical or comedy.\" (There are also always a good couple questions each year about who's a \"supporting\" actor and who's just acting.)\n\nOne Battle After Another was considered by awards-watchers to be the lead contender for awards and it did just that.\n\nThat film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio at his most offhandedly brilliant as a hapless revolutionary bumbling into nightmarish political machinations, all while surrounded by fabulous, powerful and troubled women, is currently available for streaming at movie-theater ticket prices.\n\nREAD MORE: The Louvre hit by embarrassing new blunder \ufeff\n\nCynthia Erivo as Elphaba Thropp and Ariana Grande as Glinda Upland in Wicked: For Good. (Universal Pictures)\n\nIt will return to select IMAX theatres on December 11 for a week; few tickets remain.\n\nThe gorgeous Joachim Trier film Sentimental Value , which received multiple nominations, tracks the relationship between a distressed, easily panicked actress and her callous film director father \u2013 plus the life of their family's house as well.\n\nIn addition to an unbelievable performance by Renate Reinsve in the lead role, the film also has Elle Fanning absolutely nailing the role of an American actress pushed to the levels of her comfort and talent.\n\nJacob Elordi and Mia Goth as The Creature and Elizabeth in Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein. (Netflix)\n\nIt seems like a lifetime ago, but Sinners was released just back in April and voters remembered its cultural moment and box office success. The Ryan Coogler Jim-Crow-plus-vampires hit neatly mashed up the horrors of the supernatural with the horrors of the very human.\n\nHamnet and Wicked: For Good , representing polar opposites of the year in film, also had strong showings.\n\nParents were unsurprised by nominations for KPop Demon Hunters , the soundtrack of their lives since the mega-hit was released on Netflix just (can you believe it!) back in June.\n\nZoey, from left, Rumi and Mira in a scene from KPop Demon Hunters.

    "text": "One of Australia's top universities is facing a historic crisis, with 95 per cent of staff voting no confidence in vice-chancellor Andrew Parfitt as hundreds of staff and subjects face the axe.\n\nThe National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU), which ran the vote, said 1,549 of the roughly 4,000 University of Technology Sydney (UTS) staff cast a ballot, with 1,465 expressing no confidence and just 84 expressing confidence.\n\n\"In our 35-year history, UTS has never had a staff ballot on confidence in a vice-chancellor until now. That alone speaks to the unprecedented scale of concern,\" said Dr Hossai Gul, a researcher at UTS and NTEU representative.\n\n\" Staff have waited patiently for a year, hoping for reasons to trust leadership again, but instead have experienced further secrecy, deeper fear and worsening harm. \"\n\nAndrew Parfitt came under fire earlier this year for being one of five senior executives who spent more than $140,000 on flights, accommodation and food during a trip to the US. (AAP: Bianca De Marchi)\n\nDr Parfitt was not immediately available for an interview but in a statement a university spokesperson questioned the \"integrity\" of the vote.\n\n\"We will always respect and listen to the views of our staff. However, the integrity of the vote itself is in question given complaints from some staff who tried to vote and found that their email address had already been used,\" a university spokesperson said.\n\n\"We have raised these serious concerns with the NTEU.\"\n\nThe NTEU responded to university management in a letter, saying it would correct any \"mistakes\" in the vote.\n\nWhile the vote was run by the NTEU, it was open to all UTS staff, not just NTEU members.\n\nStaff held a rally on Tuesday to announce the vote results amid a year of conflict over the need for job cuts and revelations of expensive executive travel.\n\nHossai Gul says staff have lost confidence in the vice-chancellor because of a lack of transparency and a collapse in democratic academic governance. (Supplied: Hossai Gul)\n\nThe proposed cuts also attracted the attention of state and federal inquiries and regulators, as staff in distress were given stress management advice that included \"washing delicates\".\n\n\"Staff have lost confidence in the vice-chancellor because of a pervasive lack of transparency, a collapse in democratic academic governance, and a year-long process that has caused significant organisational harm,\" Dr Gul said.\n\n\"Instead of reassurance, staff have experienced fear, confusion and exclusion from decisions that define the future of UTS.\"\n\nUniversity sends executives to US as staff face sack The spending on alumni events in May comes as the university says it needs to sack 400 staff to save $100 million.\n\nThe university spokesperson said the NTEU had \"chosen to grandstand\" rather than find \"viable\" solutions to the university's financial challenges.\n\n\"These tactics are in stark contrast to the approach from staff who have engaged in the change process, gave thoughtful ideas and worked constructively to help find solutions,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Their feedback is influencing the outcomes and next steps.\"\n\nMehreen Faruqi says the VC needs to resign. (AAP: Lukas Coch)\n\nGreens deputy leader and higher education spokesperson Mehreen Faruqi, who questioned UTS leaders at a recent Senate inquiry into alleged governance failures, attended the rally and called on the vice-chancellor to resign.\n\n\"Today's no-confidence vote makes one thing undeniable: the people who make this university run no longer trust the people who are supposed to lead it,\" Ms Faruqi said.\n\n\" When staff resoundingly reject you, it's time to go. There is no other option but for the VC to resign. \"\n\nSarah Kaine is leading a separate parliamentary inquiry into university governance. (AAP: Bianca De Marchi)\n\nThat was echoed by NSW upper house Labor MP Sarah Kaine, who is leading a separate state inquiry into university governance and also attended the rally.\n\n\"Given the debacle that has been the change process at UTS, the decent thing to do would be for the VC to resign \u2014 remembering that he has been at, or close to the helm, of the university that he claimed was in [financial] crisis,\" Dr Kaine said.\n\n$7 million spent on consultants\n\nThe turmoil at UTS began when management paid consultants KPMG $7 million to design a change management proposal called Operational Sustainability Initiative.\n\nIt proposed about 400 academic and professional staff, or roughly 10 per cent of the workforce, be made redundant and roughly 1,100 subjects be scrapped.\n\n\"UTS is operating under a deeply concerning power structure where major decisions affecting academic governance, finances, job security, teaching and research, are driven centrally by the vice-chancellor, with others expected simply to comply,\" Dr Gul said.\n\nUniversity management says mass sackings unavoidable With the university sector in crisis, thousands face losing their jobs as unions blame poor management and students say they've lost hope.\n\n\"That is not how a public university should be governed. Staff see no credible vision for the future of UTS.\"\n\nThe university spokesperson said the proposal was necessary to \"secure the future of the university\", which was spending more than it earned.\n\n\"The challenges we are facing, and change, is difficult and emotional, especially for a purpose-driven community like ours,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nLast month, the university updated its change proposal and said most academic redundancies would now be voluntary and that some of the 1,100 planned subject cuts would not proceed.\n\nEarlier this year, the university proposed about 400 academic and professional staff be made redundant. (ABC News: Monish Nand)\n\nHowever, staff anger continued to simmer, particularly when a NSW inquiry heard that amid the furore the vice-chancellor was appointed to another five-year term.\n\n\"The handling of the vice-chancellor's contract extension is a key example: over a year ago, his term was extended to seven years, without informing staff, without explaining the decision,\" Dr Gul said.\n\n\"While simultaneously telling us UTS is financially unstable and that jobs must go. That contrast has destroyed any remaining trust.\"\n\nIn a statement, the university said the failure to communicate the extension was an oversight.\n\nMore than 100 courses suspended at Sydney university The University of Technology Sydney is suspending more than 100 courses as it prepares for a controversial redundancy program to save $100 million dollars.\n\n\"In 2024, the UTS Council was mindful of the need for continuity in leadership with the chancellor's term ending in 2025 and proposed extending the vice-chancellor's contract,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"It was an oversight that this was not widely communicated at the time.\"\n\nDr Kaine said the current governance arrangements \"do not pass the pub test, let alone any test of good governance\".\n\nUTS said it had increased the representation of staff and students on the council.\n\n\"UTS Council has chosen to increase its representation of elected staff and student members above the minimum to support a strong voice in the constitution of its membership,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"UTS also has a student council liaison group.\"",

    "text": "As the social media ban for kids edges closer, teenagers in remote and rural communities are worried about becoming even more isolated.\n\nFrom Wednesday, kids under 16 will no longer be able to use popular social media platforms, like Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Kick, X and Twitch.\n\nBut for those who aren't always surrounded by kids their own age, socialising may have just become that much harder.\n\nFrankie Andrews, 13, is a state swimming champion and year 7 student enrolled at the Swifts Creek P-12 School.\n\nSwifts Creek is a remote community in Victoria's High Country, almost five hours north-east from Melbourne.\n\nFrankie said the ban coming into place was going to be a big change, and contacting her long-distance friends would not be as easy.\n\n\"I think [the ban] is a good idea and that it should be a thing; but maybe the age should be a bit lower, I reckon like maybe under fourteens,\" Frankie said.\n\n\"Just seeing what happens.\"\n\nShe said social media was something to do for people to fill time, and that it kept them up-to-date.\n\n\"It's going to be bad not being able to contact friends as easily,\" Frankie said.\n\n\" I reckon there'll be a lot of people arguing against it and that it'll still stay a thing, but people are going to find their way around it eventually. \"\n\nSocial media a way to maintain family bonds\n\nLowanna College student Sabrina Glibanovic, 13, has an online community of friends and finds inspiration for her artwork on a range of social media platforms.\n\nThe teenager from Yallourn, a regional town in Victoria's Gippsland area, also uses social media to communicate with her mother's family in Vietnam.\n\n\"I don't think they fully understand how we use it and how young people use it to connect with the world,\" she said.\n\n\" I go on to social media, and I can find images to recreate \u2026 I just struggle a bit with creativity, and some other artists do too and they like having the inspiration there, so they can have ideas help them fuel their mind. \"\n\nSabrina said she used Pinterest, Instagram and TikTok to look at different art.\n\nSabrina Glibanovic (back left) uses social media to speak with her family in Vietnam. (Supplied: Sabrina Glibanovic)\n\nShe said her friends were also concerned about the ban.\n\n\"Like all my friends, [social media] is how we communicate to each other and it's how we connect and how we just relate to each other,\" she said.\n\n\"It's going to cut off all my contact with my family from Vietnam.\n\n\"I won't be able to communicate as well with my friends and have that connection through like videos and things.\"\n\nLoading\n\nIsolation impact\n\nWith the school holidays around the corner, Sabrina said it would be harder to make plans with her friends.\n\n\"I probably won't be able to go out as much because I don't think I have a lot of their numbers, and I won't be able to hang out with them anymore,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll just be really isolated as well.\"\n\nSabrina said there were also a lot of learning opportunities on social media.\n\n\"On social media you can learn a lot about how the world works and other worldly problems, and just everything that's happening in the world,\" she said.\n\n\"I know for me, I understand how the rest of the world is, and I've got a lot of that information from social media instead of actually like searching it up, I feel like it's a more fun way of learning than just actually researching.\"\n\nDaswin De Silva says the social media ban is unlikely to stop kids. (Supplied: La Trobe University)\n\nDoubts about ban's effectiveness\n\nThe federal government has put the onus on social media companies to enforce the ban, which comes into effect on December 10.\n\nSocial media companies have announced they will use several methods to verify users' age, including having them upload identification, using AI to scan their face and analysing how they use the platforms.\n\nBut Latrobe University professor of artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics Daswin De Silva told ABC Gippsland Breakfast he doubted whether the ban would be effective.\n\n\"One thing that's clear is that this ban has made kids more innovative and creative thinking outside the box,\" Professor De Silva said.\n\n\" There's been many different methods shared on social platform using a $20 Halloween mask to bypass the facial recognition or a lot of kids moving to new apps that aren't in the ban. \"\n\nHe said the ban would lead to a \"whack-a-mole\" approach where children would move to new platforms as existing platforms were banned.",

(ABC Wide Bay: Grace Whiteside)\n\nShe travels between five schools in the North Burnett, inland from Bundaberg, teaching instrumental music and sharing her passion with students who would otherwise miss out.\n\n\"Music is for everyone,\" Ms Greenfield said.\n\nShe has been a key part in revitalising the instrumental music program at primary and high schools in the towns of Monto, Mundubbera and Gayndah.\n\nThe program is available to students in year 3 and above.

    "text": "Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out of the remainder of the Ashes series amid hamstring and Achilles tendon injuries.\n\nInjuries have thwarted the reliable right-arm quick in recent years and had forced him to watch from afar as Australia took a 2-0 series lead at the Gabba last week.\n\nHazlewood had been expected to play some part in the summer until a fresh Achilles issue clouded his availability last week and prevented him from reuniting with the squad in Brisbane.\n\nCoach Andrew McDonald today confirmed he would miss the remainder of the series.\n\nAustralia is out for Ashes domination The snarl on Steve Smith's face proves conclusively that Australia doesn't just want to beat the English in this Ashes series. It wants to break them.\n\n\"He will be out of the series and his preparation will then shift towards the [2026 T20] World Cup, which is an incredibly important campaign for us but unfortunately, Josh won't be a part of the Ashes,\" McDonald said.\n\n\"It's really flat for him. A couple of setbacks we didn't see coming. We thought he'd play a huge part in the series. We really feel for him that he won't get that opportunity.\"\n\nIt comes after Hazlewood missed the entire Test tour of Sri Lanka earlier this year and played only two of a possible five Tests in last summer's home series against India.\n\nHazlewood's absence will likely mean Scott Boland, or possibly Michael Neser, keeps his spot in the XI for the third Test and beyond.\n\nBoland has been the leading understudy for the pace-bowling cartel in recent years but Neser is coming off a five-wicket haul that helped secure victory at the Gabba.\n\nMcDonald flagged captain Pat Cummins' return from a back injury is likely to be the only change to Australia's squad for Adelaide, with Brendan Doggett expected to make way.\n\nConfirmation of the 15-player squad is expected on Wednesday, with batter Usman Khawaja set to feature on return from his back injury.\n\nLoading...\n\nDespite Mitchell Starc's heavy workloads with bat and ball, Australia is expected to play a full-strength bowling attack given a chance to secure a series victory.\n\nPlayers will have had nine full days off in between the end of the Gabba Test and the toss in Adelaide.\n\n\"We wouldn't be thinking about someone needing a rest there, it's probably more so in Test match four and five,\" McDonald said.\n\nMcDonald says there's nothing to patch up with Lyon\n\nNathan Lyon is expected to play a significant role in the attack after bowling only two overs in the first Test and being dropped for the second.\n\nThe veteran off-spinner has taken more Test wickets at Adelaide Oval than any other ground in world cricket.\n\n\"I'll make this a headline: We still do value spin,\" said McDonald, after part-timer Travis Head bowled Australia's only over of spin in Brisbane.\n\n\"That's the first game Nathan's missed in Australia for a long time. Has his impact been as great as previous seasons with the surfaces that we're playing on? Potentially not.\n\n\"(But) I think Nathan's going to have an incredibly huge impact in the last three Test matches if you look to what he did at the MCG last year.\n\n\"When the surface became benign day three onwards, he was able to navigate through a hole.\"\n\nMcDonald insisted there was nothing to patch up with Lyon, who told the Seven Network he was \"absolutely filthy\" about being dropped for the Gabba Test in favour of Neser.\n\n\"I don't think 'patch up' are the right words, that's probably a little bit of an overreaction,\" McDonald said.\n\n\"We just value different things in the pink-ball game and unfortunately that meant that Nathan had to squeeze (out), that's nothing to do with his skill set.\n\n\"For him to be disappointed, I understand that, I get that. I'd be disappointed if he wasn't disappointed.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to. A newsletter delivered each Saturday.\n\nAAP",

(ABC News: Chris Lewis)\n\nIts operations are opposed by environmentalists and some traditional owners, who worry about its proximity to the oldest collection of rock art on Earth, recently inscribed into UNESCO's World Heritage List.\n\n\"[It's] the same type of path Canada's putting itself on where the dollar becomes more important than the human,\" Chief Na'Moks said.\n\nWoodside and the West Australian government maintain there is no conclusive evidence about what impact industrial emissions are having on the Murujuga rock engravings.\n\nCanadian govt backing LNG\n\nCanada is only now starting to develop an LNG export industry, targeting the large volumes of shale gas contained within British Columbia's Montney formation.\n\nBut like in Australia, gas development has divided the region's traditional owners.\n\n\"Over the last 25 years in our homelands we have fended off upwards of 17 pipeline proposals and projects \u2026 until around 2019 and 2020,\" Gitxsan nation man Gwii Lok'im Gibuu Jesse Stoeppler said.\n\nChief Na'Moks was taken to the Karratha Gas Plant by Raelene Cooper. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)\n\nThat project was Shell's LNG Canada facility, which shipped its first cargo in June.\n\nNow a second LNG facility is being proposed for British Columbia, called Ksi Lisims.\n\nIt is being driven by a consortium of gas companies \u2014 including Woodside \u2014 and the Nisga'a Nation, which owns the coastal lands where the facility would be built.\n\nIts proponents say it will bring social benefits and jobs to Indigenous Nations and other nearby communities.\n\nBut a 900-kilometre pipeline would need to be built to bring the gas in, slicing through other Indigenous nations' lands, including Mr Stoeppler's, who have not consented to the project.\n\n'Dangerous' times\n\nThe Canadian government is desperate to boost the economy with more mining and infrastructure projects as the country continues to wrestle with the Trump administration's unpredictable tariff policies.\n\nKsi Lisims was recently referred to the Major Projects Office, a new department created to speed up approvals for projects deemed to be of national interest.\n\nThe idea mirrors the West Australian Labor government's State Development Bill, which Premier Roger Cook wants passed through parliament before the end of the year.\n\nThe premier has made no secret of his desire to cut red tape for industry, telling a recent audience of business leaders he had \"a little bit of industrial FOMO\".\n\n\"An obsession with big shiny job-creating projects, an insatiable desire for even faster approvals,\" Mr Cook said.\n\nGwii Lok'im Gibuu Jesse Stoeppler has been fending off gas developments slated for his homelands for years.

(AAP: Paul Miller)\n\nTPG operates the Vodafone brand, alongside internet providers TPG and iiNet.\n\n'We don't blame the end user at all here'\n\nMr Berroeta told the Senate hearing TPG had identified tens of thousands of mobile phones that would need software updates in order to make emergency calls, which now requires 4G technology.\n\nWhen asked why the necessary software updates were not automatic, Mr Berroeta said they were, but \"it requires the customer to accept\".\n\n\"We don't blame the end user at all here,\" Mr Berroeta later said.\n\nSome Samsung phones unable to make triple-0 calls Some Samsung mobile phone users may be unable to call triple-0 in an emergency after Telstra announced testing had revealed more than 70 models were not connecting correctly.\n\nTPG has sent messages via text, email and calls to customers whose devices need to be updated in order to access Triple Zero.\n\nMr Berroeta confirmed that included the customers whose deaths, in September and November, were believed to be linked to the telco.\n\nAdditionally, thousands of customers have phones that would never be able to make emergency calls via 4G and needed to be replaced in order to connect to Triple Zero.\n\nCustomers have been warned their phones will be blocked by TPG if they do not take action, while thousands of older models have already been blocked.\n\nThe ABC revealed in October that mobile phone testing by Telstra had identified more than 70 Samsung models that were unable to call Triple Zero on the Vodafone network when the Telstra and Optus networks were unavailable.\n\n\"Good customer relations would be to give these people a new phone now,\" Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young put to Mr Berroeta.\n\n\"You're a big company, you make massive profits, making sure your customers have access to have a phone that can call Triple Zero should be a priority.\"\n\n\"It is a priority for us,\" Mr Berroeta replied. He told the hearing that around 500 customers had taken up the offer to replace their phones.\n\nExecutives from Nokia, Ericsson, Telstra, Samsung and consumer advocacy groups will also face questions at the hearings in Canberra.\n\nThe telcos have faced scrutiny in recent months after several deaths were linked to a widespread Optus outage in September, which revealed shocking failings across the sector.",

    "text": "Regional West Australians say the government's increased airfare caps during peak flight periods will unfairly isolate them.\n\nThe state government introduced a scheme in 2022 that capped fares for one-way trips to Perth within 1,000 kilometres at $199, and $299 for flights longer than that distance.\n\nPrior to the scheme, regional residents \u2014 particularly in the Pilbara and Kimberley \u2014 would often pay more than $1,000 for one-way trips to Perth.\n\nBut from July 1 next year, the capped fares will increase during \"high-demand\" periods, and remain the same for \"low-demand\" periods.\n\nDuring high-demand periods, one-way flights to airports less than 1,000 kilometres from Perth will be capped at $265, while those further away will increase to $385.\n\nFamilies 'locked out'\n\nThe $385 cost per flight during peak periods will affect those in WA's northern regional towns, including Karratha, Broome, Exmouth, Kununurra, Newman, Paraburdoo and Port Hedland.\n\nKarratha mother of three Kirsty Freeman said busy periods such as school holidays were the only time her family could visit her Adelaide-based family and friends.\n\nKirsty and Karl Freeman have children who have appointments in Perth. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nThe raised peak-period cap will see her family pay an extra $860 to fly to and from Perth, with a total cost of $3,850.\n\n\"My friends and family can't afford to come and visit us up here,\" Ms Freeman said.\n\n'We're basically isolated in this town.\"\n\nShe said the changes meant her family would now drive 16 hours to the city to catch a flight to Adelaide.\n\n\"It's really scary for us financially,\" Ms Freeman said.\n\nShe said her teenage children needed braces, which could only be fitted and removed in Perth.\n\nA rally opposing increases to subsidised regional airfares was held in Karratha last month. (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nWA's Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) subsidises the costs of accessing medical services that are not available locally, but allied health and dental treatments are not included in the scheme.\n\n\"Just having the procedure is expensive, but then adding on flights and accommodation to get those things done as well is a little bit daunting,\" Ms Freeman said.\n\n\"People think because we're in a mining town that we're all just made of money, and that's definitely not how it is.\"\n\nJo Camilleri says families with children at boarding schools will be affected. (Supplied)\n\nConcerns for boarders\n\nKimberley parent and Isolated Children's Parents' Association member Jo Camilleri said the changes were \"worrying\", especially for students who were studying away from home.\n\n\"It's during the peak season we need the cap more,\" she said.\n\n\"It's during school holidays that kids are flying home and that's why we really needed it in the first place.\n\n\"If anything, you'd hope the cap was in place for [busy periods] rather than the reverse.\"\n\nMs Camilleri was concerned the price changes would most affect families living in remote towns like Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing, who also have to travel long distances just to get to an airport.\n\n\"It just gets further and further out of reach for families \u2026 the more remote people get, the more difficult this becomes,\" she said.\n\nKim Simpson says the cap increase is \"garbage\". (ABC Pilbara: Mietta Adams)\n\nKim Simpson organised a petition against increased subsidised fare caps and has so far collected more than 6,000 signatures.\n\nShe described the changes as \"garbage\".\n\nShe said while it was \"fantastic\" the cap was kept, the subsidised flights were already too expensive.\n\n\"I've flown to Perth three times in the past month and I've spent close to $3,000,\" she said.\n\n\"We are still going to keep on with the petition \u2026 we can still fight for these cheaper fares,\" she said.\n\nHigh-demand period remains vague\n\nPremier Roger Cook said the cap increase was necessary to keep the scheme sustainable and to meet the difference between airline prices in peak periods.\n\nRoger Cook says the government and airlines will decide what is considered a \"peak period\". (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\n\"We want to reward those people who are looking to travel in times of low demand,\" he said.\n\n\"But for last-minute bookings or for high peak demands, the subsidy isn't as high.\"\n\n\"This is better than pre-2022, when they [regional families] would have paid literally thousands.\"\n\nDeciding what is considered \"peak period\" will be an arrangement between the government and the airlines, he said.\n\n'We will work closely with airlines to ensure that they bring the right approach, the right attitude to this,\" Mr Cook said.\n\nThe state government said that for the first time, airlines could choose to offer capped fares that were cheaper than the set maximums.\n\nMr Cook said the scheme would continue until June 2031 before it would be reviewed again.",

It wants to break them.\n\n\"I say it with a smile my face though, Jake,\" Stokes said.\n\nWhile sledging is a common part of the game, the heated end to the Brisbane Test is bound to create tension ahead of the start of the third Test in Adelaide on December 17.\n\nThe English squad has travelled to Noosa for a break before the third Test, as England's second team lost badly to Australia A at Allan Border Field in Brisbane, highlighting the nation's current lack of depth.\n\n\"I actually felt like we over-prepared to be honest,\" McCullum said after the second Test.\n\n\"I think sometimes when you're in the heat of the battle, as we all know, sometimes the most important thing is to feel a bit fresh.\"",

    "text": "The West Australian food ambassador says the fishing industry should take the lead on education as consumers search for local alternatives in the wake of major changes to fishing rules.\n\nLast week the WA government announced a plan to slash demersal catch limits and shut down some fisheries to save species on the brink of extinction.\n\nThat was followed by warnings from fishers and the food service industry that the new rules could make it harder for the public to source locally caught fish or find them on restaurant menus.\n\nDhufish will be difficult to find at restaurants from next month. (ABC News: Chris Lewis)\n\nAffordable, healthy alternatives\n\nMany chefs and cooks across the state will be rethinking their shopping lists and menus before the ban comes into effect later this month.\n\nWhat are demersal fish? Demersal scalefish are long-living, slow-growing fish species that live and feed near the seabed. Popular demersal fish in WA waters include dhufish, pink snapper and red emperor.\n\nChef Don Hancey, who has been appointed WA's food ambassador to promote local produce, said he felt for the fishers impacted by the changes, particularly generational family businesses.\n\nHe suggested those planning new menus consider the \"underutilised species\" found in WA waters.\n\n\"We've got beautiful herring, we've got mullet, we've got the sardines from Freo and down south, we've also got the Australian salmon,\" Mr Hancey said.\n\n\"So there's great opportunities to make something simple, like fish cakes, that are super affordable.\n\n\"There are alternatives, but there needs to be a push now to educate people that using these underutilised species is not only good for the pocket, but good for your health.\"\n\nMr Hancey believes Australian salmon is an \"under-utilised\" species. (Supplied: Louise FitzRoy)\n\nIndustry-led showcase\n\nMr Hancey anticipated it would take time for the public to change culinary habits, but believed industry showcases could expedite the process.\n\n\"It needs WAFIC [Western Australian Fishing Industry Council] and other organisations like FRDC [Fisheries Research and Development Corporation] to really start showcasing these species to the general public and chefs to increase their knowledge,\" he said.\n\nMr Hancey said a herring dish at his former restaurant in Yallingup had been a popular addition to the menu.\n\n\"One of the biggest sellers on the breakfast menu was herring, pan-fried, lots of lemon juice, little bit of butter, and some chopped parsley served on a sourdough toast,\" he said.\n\n\" It's not only tasty and economical, but it is so, so healthy for you. \"\n\nAs a pelagic species of fish, herring are unaffected by the rule changes. (Supplied: Shannon Conway)\n\nAdapting with consumer tastes\n\nAlbany commercial fisher Tony Westerberg said he was in \"disbelief\" when he heard of the changes that would affect his industry peers.\n\n\"Fish stocks are ailing but what they've done is ridiculous,\" he said.\n\nMr Westerberg's business is focused on pelagic species \u2014 catching sardines, herring and salmon.\n\nCommercial fisherman and seafood wholesaler Tony Westerberg expects demand will change. (ABC Great Southern: Georgia Hargreaves)\n\nHe said one challenge with herring was an aversion to \"strong\" flavours among younger consumers.\n\n\"It's normally fairly strong-tasting and not many younger people like the oiliness of the fish,\" Mr Westerberg said.\n\n\"So we've done the herring in a way which is deep skinning, and there's no traditional herring flavour \u2026 it's still got all the goodness in there.\"\n\nHe expects demand to slowly shift after the changes come into effect on December 16.",

I've been out since then, so this is a pretty special one.\"\n\nAnthony made the final of the season opener in tough, icy conditions the day prior after qualifying third, but was unable to complete her run, perhaps a little rusty after watching from afar for the past 12 months.\n\n\"Yesterday was a bummer,\" she said.\n\n\"I just didn't quite nail that last one.\n\n\"To get redemption tonight is pretty special. It's been a while since I skied a comp, so I had to remember that and make those adjustments tonight.\"\n\nAmerican pair Olivia Giaccio and last year's World Cup winner Jaelen Kauf claimed the other two podium positions.\n\nThe victory is the 27-year-old's 24th World Cup gold.\n\nAustralians Charlotte Wilson (13th) and Emma Bosco (20th) also competed.\n\nMeanwhile, Graham claimed his first victory in a World Cup since Deer Valley in the 2022/23 season, nailing a superb run as last skier to compete.\n\n\"It's good to be putting down really good runs. The course was challenging, but really fun, and I'm just enjoying it,\" he said.\n\n\"To get a double gold with Jakara \u2014 it's massive. We're not a skiing nation. We're a beach nation, so how the hell does this happen?\"\n\nFellow Australian Harvey Jackson (18th) also competed, with Cooper Woods and George Murphy both failing to complete the course in what remained tough conditions.\n\nGraham, 31, has had a superb start to the season, claiming fourth place in the season opener on the same course on Sunday.\n\nIt is the third time in history that Australia has claimed gold medals in both men's and women's events on the same day.\n\nVeteran skier Graham has been a part of all three.\n\nThere was disappointment for the aerial skiers though, with Australia missing having a skier on the podium for the first time in a World Cup event since January 2023.\n\nAirleigh Frigo (6th), Laura Peel (10th), Danielle Scott (13th) and Abbey Willcox (14th) all competed in the women's event, with Riley Flanagan (19th) in the men's.\n\nThe next two moguls events on the calendar in Sweden and Georgia have been cancelled, so the moguls skiers will take a break and resume competition in the new year at Val Saint-Come in Canada.\n\nThe Winter Olympic Games competition gets underway in Livigno on February 10.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

Under the family reunion rules, federal MPs are allowed up to three return business class flights per year for family members flying between the MP\u2019s home base and a city other than Canberra, and the value of nine business class flights to Canberra, though there is some flexibility to the rules that allows ministers to claim more. Coalition MP calls for Wells to resign as minister\n\nWells has defended the flights and expenses as within the rules, but has endured ongoing criticism for the nature of her trips and a lack of judgment in flying her children and husband to Thredbo for a ski trip, and billing taxpayers thousands to fly her husband to three AFL grand finals and two Boxing Day Test matches. On most occasions, her husband flew home to Brisbane on the same day. Wells\u2019 expenses first came under scrutiny last Wednesday when it was revealed in an answer to a Senate estimates committee that she billed taxpayers almost $100,000 to fly herself, a staffer and a public servant to New York in September for the United Nations General Assembly. Nationals senator Matt Canavan on Tuesday called for Wells to resign because though she may not have broken any rules, there was a pattern of misjudgment that did not meet community expectations.

At Riverside Theatres, audiences dreamt of a Christmas that doesn\u2019t sweat their entrails out, while being razzle-dazzled to distraction by the stage adaptation of Holiday Inn, a two-hour affair featuring a live band, a dizzying array of sparkle-heavy costumes, old-world charm and some vigorously inventive original choreography by Veronica Beattie George.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen a tap-dancing ensemble perform synchronised jump-rope with green tinsel, are you even in the silly season?\n\nThe show features a dizzying array of sparkle-heavy costumes.

I want to know whether Mamdani\u2019s policies on universal childcare, rent freezes and free buses have resonated with Reece, a Labor Party member who is proud of his progressive background but who ran as an independent with a Liberal deputy in his election to Town Hall last year. Lord Mayor Nick Reece weighs up his first year in office over lunch at Marmelo. Credit: Justin McManus \u201cWhat about his agenda?\u201d I ask. \u201cI will be watching with great interest,\u201d Reece says, moving on to his own agenda. \u201cI went to the people of Melbourne with a very big and inspiring agenda. I\u2019m in the reform game. I\u2019m not here for the title and the chains. I\u2019m here because I want to make a difference, and I\u2019m a mayor on a mission.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s one year since Reece was elected as lord mayor and to mark the occasion we are having lunch at Marmelo, a hatted restaurant in this year\u2019s Good Food Guide and one of the finalists for best new restaurant. Loading The hotel is located in the ground floor of luxury hotel Hyde Melbourne Place and the dining room with its large glass windows looks out onto a graffiti-covered laneway filled with wheelie bins. You couldn\u2019t get much more Melbourne. Reece has been to Marmelo before and is enthusiastic about the menu. We start with the anchovies, two single salty slivers doused in oil and laid across the plate, which are delicious in their simplicity. \u201cThose anchovies are next level,\u201d Reece says. It\u2019s the first of many superlatives he uses to describe our meal, that include \u2018delicious\u2019, \u2018absolutely sublime\u2019 and \u2018a culinary revelation\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s typical of Reece, at times he is so enthusiastic it\u2019s almost infectious. His enthusiasm is a quality he brings to his work as lord mayor, a role he describes as \u201cthe greatest honour of my life\u201d and one where he deploys his expertise in networking and lobbying. We both order a glass of chardonnay and Reece tells me about moving to Australia as a child from the United Kingdom and growing up in a \u201cchurchy\u201d family with a strong emphasis on community service. His dad still volunteers at St Vincent de Paul and regularly calls him to take his son to task on various policies. The \u201cnext level\u201d anchovies at Marmelo. Credit: Justin McManus Reece is married to Felicity Pantelidis, the deputy chief executive of Labor law firm Maurice Blackburn, and started his career there as a lawyer before becoming an adviser to then-prime minister Julia Gillard and more recently a public policy fellow at the University of Melbourne. I ask Reece what his major achievements have been in his first year as mayor and he nominates cracking down on crime and safety in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere still are people who are surprised I went so hard on that,\u201d he says. \u201cI also have a very strong view that a great city begins with being a safe city, and there\u2019s no getting around what the crime data was telling us and what I was hearing out there in the community as well. It\u2019s not only about being a safe city, it\u2019s that people feel safe as well.\u201d Reece points to the 11 council security guards who now patrol Melbourne\u2019s streets and his push to double the number of CCTV cameras in the city. Crime and safety have dominated the agenda at the City of Melbourne\u2019s council meetings and at a recent meeting, the council heard from dozens of people experiencing homelessness along with community legal services about how vulnerable people are targeted by the security guards and moved on. Celeraic Portuguese tarts topped with spanner crab. Credit: Justin McManus Reece has personal experience of homelessness and addiction in his own family after his brother-in-law, Evan, was badly injured in a bike accident, and through the pain management became a heroin addict. \u201cWe were all close and lived through the downward spiral,\u201d Reece says. \u201cIt caused a lot of heartache and a lot of pain in our family.\u201d Reece says the experience has stayed with him and shapes how he approaches issues like safe-injecting rooms, homelessness and street support services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe voted against the majority of his fellow councillors recently in backing a safe-injecting room in the CBD. \u201cI am a strong supporter of active outreach, of saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t stay there, that\u2019s not good for you, it\u2019s not good for the city, you need support\u2019,\u201d he says. Reece approves of the Allan government\u2019s move to try children as young as 14 as adults if they are accused of violent crime. Skewers of garfish at Marmelo are doused in vinho verde vinegar. Credit: Justin McManus \u201cI certainly welcome the direction that they have taken, and I do think the underlying principle that there needs to be consequences for violent and illegal behaviour is a very important one.\u201d I point to my own children and Reece\u2019s three teenagers and ask whether he thinks a 14-year-old\u2019s brain is fully developed and they should cop the adult consequences of jail. \u201cWell if your kid was pulling out a machete and walking through a shopping centre threatening people, then yes,\u201d Reece says.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "The federal government's long-awaited social media ban for children under 16 is on the verge of taking effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe restrictions will prevent Australian children from creating or keeping an account on many popular social platforms, including Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Annika Wells has repeatedly said the ban will protect children from exposure to pressures and risks that come with being logged into social media accounts and insists any \"short-term discomfort will be worth the long-term benefits\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSome experts have been divided over the issue, saying the ban will have positive and negative effects , while others have argued social media is an important tool for young people to have access to .\n\n\n\nWhen does Australia's social media ban start and who will it impact?\n\nThe ban comes into force on Wednesday 10 December \u2014 the deadline for specified social media platforms to restrict users aged under 16 from accessing their accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta has confirmed users aged under 16 travelling overseas for a short-term holiday will still be restricted from using Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor temporary visa holders, such as international students, a spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner said the rules apply to young people under 16 who are \"ordinarily resident\" in Australia and that these users should be aware their accounts may be flagged.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said it's unlikely teens who enter Australia for a short holiday will have their accounts restricted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, if they stay in Australia for an extended period, such as long study periods, then our age assurance measures will take effect,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nWhat apps will be banned for kids in Australia?\n\nThe platforms banned had to meet certain criteria as decided by Wells, which includes that they allow users to interact, and link, with other users, and post material.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 21 November, eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant decided the following services will be age-restricted social media platforms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Facebook\n\n\n\n\u2014 Instagram\n\n\n\n\u2014 Kick\n\n\n\n\u2014 Reddit\n\n\n\n\u2014 Snapchat\n\n\n\n\u2014 Threads\n\n\n\n\u2014 TikTok\n\n\n\n\u2014 Twitch\n\n\n\n\u2014 X\n\n\n\n\u2014 YouTube\n\n\n\nCould more apps be added to Australia's social media ban?\n\nThe following platforms will not be age-restricted, at least, for now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Discord\n\n\n\n\u2014 GitHub\n\n\n\n\u2014 Google Classroom\n\n\n\n\u2014 LEGO Play\n\n\n\n\u2014 Messenger\n\n\n\n\u2014 Pinterest\n\n\n\n\u2014 Roblox\n\n\n\n\u2014 Steam and Steam Chat\n\n\n\n\u2014 WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\u2014 YouTube Kids\n\n\n\n\n\nInman Grant says the list is dynamic, meaning there could be additions to age-restricted platforms, especially if children flock to one platform amid the ban.\n\n\n\nSeveral smaller apps are growing in popularity as children migrate to those not included in the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey include Lemon8, which has agreed to restrict use of its app to those 16 and older as of Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHow will age verification work on social media platforms?\n\nIt's ultimately up to the platform to decide how it will verify the age of its users. However, the government says requesting ID cannot be the only method.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook and Instagram\u2019s parent company Meta hasn't specified how it plans to verify users\u2019 ages. However, it has already notified users aged 13 to 15 that their accounts will be shut down.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 Instagram accounts are expected to be affected.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meta starts blocking under-16s as social media ban approaches\n\nTikTok said in a statement it already uses a \"multi-layered approach that combines technology and human moderation to detect accounts used by teens who may not have provided their correct date of birth\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapchat has told users it will verify ages through k-ID, which is an age assurance platform, or data verification site ConnectID. Users can also upload government-issued photo identification.\n\n\n\n\n\nKick will also use the same k-ID technology, while YouTube said it would determine age based on its associated Google account and other signals.\n\n\n\nCan kids get around the social media ban?\n\nPlatforms face up to $49.5 million in fines if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent under-16s from holding an account.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs outlined by eSafety, this includes measures to prevent children from using false identity documents, AI tools or deepfakes, and from using virtual private networks (VPNs) to make it appear as though they're outside the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatforms could also investigate signals such as activity patterns consistent with school schedules, connections with other users under 16, and analysis of the language level and style used by the account holder.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can also use location-based signals such as IP addresses, device language and time settings and an Australian phone number.\n\n\n\nWill children or parents be penalised if they do access an account?\n\nThere are no penalties for children, parents or carers. The government has stated the age-restriction laws are to encourage platforms to take greater responsibility for a child's safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, it is the platforms themselves that could face penalties of up to $49.5 million if they don\u2019t take the steps to implement the changes as laid out by the Australian government.\n\n\n\n\n\neSafety has also warned that if your child is asked to pay a fine for being on social media while under 16, it is a scam.\n\n\n\n",

Working with people like such to Pauline, I think I have a fellow traveller, and I have great respect for the work that Pauline has done. She has driven the political agenda.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Annika Wells is facing public scrutiny for her expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nRevelations show that her business class flights to New York for her and two staffers cost taxpayers nearly $95,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Wells airfares cost $34,427, while her Deputy Chief of Staff\u2019s flights cost $38,166, and an Assistant Secretary for Online Safety incurred $22,236.31 in airfares.\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearing on Sky News, James Patterson, the Shadow Minister for Cyber Security, is slamming the flight costs as exorbitant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't even know how you can spend one hundred thousand dollars on return flights to new york city, even if you're flying business class. sometimes first class flights don't even cost that much money.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Wells is defending her three-day New York trip, which cost taxpayers over $100,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she was scheduled to travel with the Prime Minister to the U-N General Assembly to deliver a speech on Australia's social media ban in September.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the news of the Optus triple zero outage, her departure was delayed, forcing a last-minute re-booking of the New York flights.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe maintains that the travel was for important work and that the expenses adhered to official guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had to be in two places at once. The communications portfolio had two really serious things happening at the same time. Like you said, I was initially meant to leave the Saturday morning with the prime minister the Optus crisis. We only found out about 12 hours earlier than that. We made the decision that I should delay work through that across the weekend, get the independent investigation on foot, and then get to the UN to uphold my commitment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn ABC's Insiders Prime Minister Anthony Albanese defended the government's decision to book these last minute flights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You or your office had to approve that flight? of course, of course, and we spoke. We spoke on the morning that Minister wells travelled. It was a very significant event for Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister for Social Services Tanya Plibersek stood behind Ms Wells, defending the trip as an important part of the world-first social media ban coming into effect on December 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we're up against the big tech giants, having that sort of global support really helps us in what we're doing, and the reason we're doing this, of course, is because we've been contacted by so many parents who are worried about the impact that social media has had on their kids or is having on a whole generation of kids. Being in New York was valuable, important. It helps Australia's interests, and it helps us do what we want to do, which is stand up to the big tech giants and protect our kids.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Minister Wells is being asked to explain other travel expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June, Ms Wells attended the Paralympics Australia Adaptive Festival, where she claimed $3000 in taxpayer family reunion entitlements so her husband and children could join her for a weekend at the Thredbo ski resort in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, while serving as Minister for Sports, Ms Wells was sent to Paris for the 2024 Olympic games.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring her time there, Minister Wells was allocated $10,000 for ground transport and authorised to spend up to $1,200 a day on food.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of this, she spent $1,000 for a working dinner with the Australian Ambassador to France and a French official.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Sky News interview the Minister defended her actions by maintaining that she operated strictly within the rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Viewers can absolutely have an opinion about the rules and parliamentarian entitlements and whether or not they should be changed but my role is to abide by them and that is what I've done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Minister for Industry and Innovation, Alex Hawke, says that Minister Wells's actions \"don't pass the pub test.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is questioning why taxpayers were billed for expensive meals when she claimed to be only eating \"muesli bars\" or \"falling asleep at the table\" in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Minister's defenses don't seem to stack up either. I mean, if the Minister is eating a muesli bar and falling asleep in Paris, then why is the taxpayer being charged for expensive dinners and expensive food and expensive travel if she's not partaking of them? So if her defense is, well, I was working really hard and I didn't eat much and I wasn't really paying attention or asleep at the table, then we could presumably recoup some of that money.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Hawke says the Australian public will not be convinced by the justification that the expenses were simply within the rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I mean, when you look at the expenses of Anna wells, whether it's New York, whether it's Paris, whether it's thread bow, these are expenses that would make the Royals blush. And yet she looks down the camera and says, Oh, well, it's all within the guidelines. Now, I think Australians aren't going to buy that. I think this is these are very expensive trips for relatively junior minister, and she hasn't justified why the expenses were so high, unbelievably high.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian is now reporting that Anika Wells charged taxpayers nearly $9,000 for return flights so her husband could attend the AFL Grand Final three years in a row between 2022 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also spent almost $1800 for her and her husband to attend the Melbourne Formula 1 Grand Prix last year, after receiving four free tickets to the event from the organiser Motorsport Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition is calling for an independent review into Ms Well's expenses as well as asking her to repay the money.\n\n\n\n",

Now this is really risky, because firstly any poultry is washed in processing so you don't need to do it. But if you wash it, you're going to splash it right around the kitchen and you're going to get bacteria everywhere. Particularly salmonella, which gives you a really nasty form of food poisoning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe wants to make sure fewer than the average 4.67 million* people get food poisoning this year, because it is no joke.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also costing the economy around three billion dollars a year*, with an uptick in cases over the Christmas-New Year period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood safety experts say food poisoning is more dangerous than most people realise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just a funny tummy, it really is nasty. And it can make you really ill. It can be life threatening if you have a poor immune system or if you're pregnant or if you're frail and elderly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're keen for a roast, Christmas ham is another European tradition, adopted in the southern hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can have your ham hot or cold, but experts including Ms Buchtmann say; it can't be old!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it's wrapped, check the use-by date and abide by it.\n\n\n\n\n\nLydia Buchtmann says to remember that a ham is for a few days - not for life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wrap it up in, I'd get something called a ham-bag which is sort of just a cloth bag you can put it in. Or a clean cloth. Soak that cloth in a mixture of vinegar and water, so about a litre of water with two tablespoons of vinegar in it. And keep that cloth moist so it doesn't dry out and keep it in the fridge and change it every three days or so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature matters in the preparation process - try to remember these numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCook your meat to 75 degrees when you test it with a thermometer - that includes mince and sausages.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep your fridge at 5 degrees - it's important, so you might need to get a thermometer, to test it every few hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you've bought some top shelf bubbles or wine, it shouldn't be on the top shelf of the fridge - take it out and put it on ice.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeers and wine are shelf-stable when they're in unopened bottles - so they don't present a risk of illness, unless you drink too much of them!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're hosting a big meal, save your valuable fridge space for the food; and there is a hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrinks are out - except for juice and dairy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top shelf belongs to salads, with cheeses and dips below and at the bottom, uncooked meats and poultry - that's to make sure they don't contaminate anything else.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're not a drinker and you don't eat meat - a lingering cheese platter and dip are an opportunity for bacteria to thrive.\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts will need to make hourly trips to the fridge to refresh these dishes - and a generous serving can be a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea is to put them out in small servings at a time. It's a real risk if you, say, put out a dip or you put a brie there or something and then you get more stuff out of the fridge and you put it on top. So, put out small amounts, leave the rest in the fridge and replace it every hour or so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVegans are not in the clear, either - there are some key considerations with your summer salads and vegetables.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like your cheeses and dips, they can't sit out for too long - and they can easily spoil in the heat.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll know, if you've ever left a salad in your bag on a hot day.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Ms Buchtmann says there is another big mistake we're making, in the name of being clean: gloves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most people leave them on way too long, so we actually think it is better if you just wash your hands quite often. And you need to wash your hands before you handle food and if you've been handling risky foods like raw meat and raw poultry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother tip is to buy what you need and not too much more - it cuts down the risk of food spoiling.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there is a fix if you find yourself swimming in leftovers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't love them and leave them - love them and freeze them.\n\n\n\n",

I'm Greg Dyett\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns says a firefighter has died while battling fires on the state's Central Coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe man died after being crushed by a tree during bushfire prevention work north of Newcastle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're hearing distressing news this morning that a member of our national parks firefighting team has died on a fireground which is obviously a terrible reminder of how difficult and dangerous this work is and how the people who put their lives on the line to protect lives and property do an incredible job for us in this state. But it's a deeply distressing turn of events, and a sad day for New South Wales this morning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 20 homes have been destroyed in the fires.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in Tasmania, authorities say 19 homes have been destroyed in a bushfire at Dolphin Sands.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition frontbencher James Paterson says he opposes the inclusion of YouTube in the social media ban for those under 16.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban takes effect on Wednesday and requires tech companies to bring in technology to stop children under the age of 16 from having accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage holders aren't expected to get an early Christmas present from the Reserve Bank, with a cut to interest rates all but off the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe central bank has started two days of talks in its final board meeting of the year, after which the official cash rate is expected to remain at 3.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish photographer Martin Parr died at his home on Bristol at the age of 73.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Martin Parr Foundation confirmed the news.\n\n\n\n\n\nA celebrated photographer, Parr was known for his documentary-style photography focusing on British social class that was often colourful and satirical, but also thought-provoking.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving risen to prominence in the 1980s, his career went on to span decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this interview, he says photography continues to play an important role in society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think people still think of photography as something that's done as a craft rather than as an accessory to other arts. Whereas, if you look at the democracy of photography, you look at the incredible number of people who are posting images on Instagram, the support photography, photography shows are very popular. Photographic books sell very well. So, it's really just the establishment from the art world catching up and understanding how important photography is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMourners in Hong Kong continue to lay flowers and tributes at a memorial site where a fire engulfed seven residential towers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blaze on November 26, killed at least 159 people and took nearly two days to extinguish.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice have arrested 15 people on suspicion of manslaughter, and 12 have also been arrested in a corruption investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice have arrested a man in London after a group of people were assaulted with pepper spray in a Heathrow Airport car park.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbulance crews treated 21 people, including a three-year-old girl, at the scene and five were taken to the hospital although their injuries were not believed to be serious.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice say the incident occurred after an argument escalated between two groups who knew each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne man was being held on suspicion of assault.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice were searching for other suspects who left the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaty Perry and Justin Trudeau have gone Instagram official with their romance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 41-year-old singer shared a post on the social media platform that contained intimate photos and videos from a trip to Japan with Canada's former prime minister.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers has announced the federal government will not provide another round of energy bill rebates.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking in Canberra ahead of the upcoming mid-year budget update on Monday, Chalmers said the rebate scheme would not be extended beyond the end of this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This marks a shift in the way that we are delivering cost of living relief,\" he said. \"This is a shift from temporary measures, first decided when inflation was almost 8 per cent, a shift towards ongoing cost of living help.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe argued that changes to the tax system, as well as to Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, would deliver more permanent relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People can use that to help pay their electricity bills or to meet their other cost of living pressures,\" he said of the tax cuts. \"This wasn't an easy decision, but it's the right decision.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is more than one way to provide this cost of living relief that people still need in their household budgets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAll households and many small businesses received $300 in relief in the 2024 budget, paid quarterly. A $150 extension for the second half of 2025 was announced ahead of the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers has now ruled out a fourth round, saying the government had \"been up-front with people and said that these were never going to be a permanent feature of the budget\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why your energy bills could be getting higher and what you can do about it\n\nLabor delivered tax cuts in July 2024, with further rate reductions scheduled from 1 July 2026 and 1 July 2027. In March, the government said the combined effect of these changes would see the average tax cut reach around $43 a week in 2026\u201327.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Round two is not that far away,\" Chalmers said.\n\n\n\nOpposition reacts\n\nIn a joint statement, Opposition Treasury spokesperson Ted O'Brien and finance spokesperson James Paterson said: \"Labor\u2019s decision to end household energy bill relief exposes the Albanese Government\u2019s cost-of-living, energy policy and budget disasters for all to see.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Albanese Government has already overseen the sharpest fall in living standards in the developed world, and all signs point to further cost-of-living pain in the year ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Coalition understands we must address the root causes of Labor\u2019s energy bill crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s why the Coalition is offering an alternative energy plan that prioritises affordable and reliable energy. Our emissions reduction goals will never come at the expense of Australian families, and this principle will guide every decision we take.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition revealed its energy policy last month after both the Nationals and the Liberals dumped net zero by 2025 commitments from their platforms.\n\n\n\nAustralians feeling the pressure as energy prices rise\n\nMany Australians are feeling the pinch as electricity prices drive up inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nInflation data released last month showed electricity prices had jumped by 37 per cent in the past year, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics noting that the rise was primarily driven by state government rebates being used up by households.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July, Energy Consumers Australia found in a report that one in five Australian households is struggling to pay its energy bills, with renters disproportionately affected.\n\n\n\nDavid Stuart runs a paint business on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches. Last month, he told SBS News he had been spending $24,000 a year on electricity before investing in renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We took the plunge. We went solar, we got a bank loan to do it,\" he said. \"That bank loan is now paid off. Our power bills are now negative.\"\n\n\n\nWhat to do about pricey energy bills\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at financial comparison website Canstar, said millions of Australians are overpaying for utilities simply because they haven't checked the competition in a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our research shows switching from an average-priced plan to one of the lowest in the market could save a typical household up to $406 a year in some areas, even more for larger households,\" she told SBS News earlier this year.\n\n\n\nConsumers can also speak with energy providers and ask what support is available to pay bills. Legally, retailers must declare if a better offer is available.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Australians face a hot summer, there are several ways to keep cool while limiting energy costs \u2014 such as running the dishwasher and washing machine during off-peak periods, and using the oven only during cooler times of day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CSIRO recommends setting air conditioning temperatures between 24C and 25C, noting that for every degree you lower the temperature, costs can increase by 10 per cent.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Farrell charges for hundreds of family flights Farrell charged taxpayers more than $116,000 for family travel since 2022, according to Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority data. This includes flying a family member to Uluru, where he had been gifted tickets to a Wintjiri Wiru Sunset Dinner in August 2024. The flights that coincided with the dinner cost $2093.65 for a return trip from Adelaide to Uluru via Sydney. Other family travel matched dates that Farrell had been gifted tickets, including return flights for a family member to Sydney, costing $1385.21, at the same time as opera La Boheme at the Sydney Opera House. Farrell had been given a double pass and hospitality, according to his register of interests. Minister for Trade and Tourism, and Special Minister of State Don Farrell. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Farrell defended the expenses, saying they were within the guidelines and that the rules allowed for carers and single parents to become politicians.\n\n\u201cThe family reunion provisions are an important feature of our framework, allowing a diverse range of members and senators to represent their communities in our nation\u2019s parliament,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur parliament would be a lesser place if it weren\u2019t for the mechanisms that allow young mothers, single parents, those with families, and those with caring responsibilities to serve as elected members.\u201d Loading Minister for Home Affairs Tony Burke, in 2020, repaid the cost of flights for his family to join him on a trip to Uluru in 2012 because, while within the rules, he said the expenses \u201cdid not meet community expectations\u201d. Under the family reunion rules, federal MPs are allowed up to three return business class flights per year for family members flying between the MP\u2019s home base and a city other than Canberra, and the value of nine business class flights to Canberra, though there is some flexibility to the rules that allows ministers to claim more. Coalition MP calls for Wells to resign as minister\n\nWells has defended the flights and expenses as within the rules, but has endured ongoing criticism for the nature of her trips and a lack of judgment in flying her children and husband to Thredbo for a ski trip, and billing taxpayers thousands to fly her husband to three AFL grand finals and two Boxing Day Test matches. On most occasions, her husband flew home to Brisbane on the same day. Wells\u2019 expenses first came under scrutiny last Wednesday when it was revealed in an answer to a Senate estimates committee that she billed taxpayers almost $100,000 to fly herself, a staffer and a public servant to New York in September for the United Nations General Assembly. Nationals senator Matt Canavan on Tuesday called for Wells to resign because though she may not have broken any rules, there was a pattern of misjudgment that did not meet community expectations.

I think she needs to be shown a red,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\nCanavan said getting a Comcar to wait seven hours at the tennis was \u201cridiculous\u201d, and other ministers had been forced out of parliamentary positions for less, including former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and Opposition Leader Sussan Ley. \u201cYou\u2019re spending other people\u2019s money, not your own. So I don\u2019t think Anika Wells, as a minister of the crown, has shown any care and diligence here to make sure her spending ... meets that value for money test,\u201d Canavan said. \u201cThe question now is to the prime minister, what standards do you have? Do you apply any discipline to your ministers to pay a price if they\u2019re not seen to be spending money in a value sense?\u201d This masthead revealed on Monday that Wells charged taxpayers almost $1000 to have a government-funded Comcar wait seven hours for her while she attended the Australian Open tennis final in January 2023, and the Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday she claimed another $765 for a chauffeur-driven car while attending the Magic Millions Race Day on the Gold Coast in January 2024. Coalition figures have challenged the government\u2019s response, saying the travel was outside what Australians expect.\n\n\u201cWhether things are in the guidelines or not, it\u2019s always up to the individual parliamentarian to justify his or her expenses. That\u2019s always been the case,\u201d shadow treasurer Ted O\u2019Brien told ABC Radio National. Loading He called the judgment of Wells and the prime minister into question for claiming the expenses were appropriate during a cost-of-living crisis. \u201cWhat we see here is the prime minister defending a minister who is spending money that is hard to justify in the public eye,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cSaying that this level of spending is fine \u2013 that goes to his judgment.\u201d",

I\u2019m in the reform game. I\u2019m not here for the title and the chains. I\u2019m here because I want to make a difference, and I\u2019m a mayor on a mission.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s one year since Reece was elected as lord mayor and to mark the occasion we are having lunch at Marmelo, a hatted restaurant in this year\u2019s Good Food Guide and one of the finalists for best new restaurant. Loading The hotel is located in the ground floor of luxury hotel Hyde Melbourne Place and the dining room with its large glass windows looks out onto a graffiti-covered laneway filled with wheelie bins. You couldn\u2019t get much more Melbourne. Reece has been to Marmelo before and is enthusiastic about the menu. We start with the anchovies, two single salty slivers doused in oil and laid across the plate, which are delicious in their simplicity. \u201cThose anchovies are next level,\u201d Reece says. It\u2019s the first of many superlatives he uses to describe our meal, that include \u2018delicious\u2019, \u2018absolutely sublime\u2019 and \u2018a culinary revelation\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s typical of Reece, at times he is so enthusiastic it\u2019s almost infectious. His enthusiasm is a quality he brings to his work as lord mayor, a role he describes as \u201cthe greatest honour of my life\u201d and one where he deploys his expertise in networking and lobbying. We both order a glass of chardonnay and Reece tells me about moving to Australia as a child from the United Kingdom and growing up in a \u201cchurchy\u201d family with a strong emphasis on community service. His dad still volunteers at St Vincent de Paul and regularly calls him to take his son to task on various policies. The \u201cnext level\u201d anchovies at Marmelo.

I ask Reece what his major achievements have been in his first year as mayor and he nominates cracking down on crime and safety in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere still are people who are surprised I went so hard on that,\u201d he says. \u201cI also have a very strong view that a great city begins with being a safe city, and there\u2019s no getting around what the crime data was telling us and what I was hearing out there in the community as well. It\u2019s not only about being a safe city, it\u2019s that people feel safe as well.\u201d Reece points to the 11 council security guards who now patrol Melbourne\u2019s streets and his push to double the number of CCTV cameras in the city. Crime and safety have dominated the agenda at the City of Melbourne\u2019s council meetings and at a recent meeting, the council heard from dozens of people experiencing homelessness along with community legal services about how vulnerable people are targeted by the security guards and moved on. Celeraic Portuguese tarts topped with spanner crab.

Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nMr Berroeta said TPG was informing those customers and that information on the affected devices was only received from the manufacturers in \u201cthe last couple of weeks\u201d.\n\nHe denied TPG had breached regulatory requirements to shut down affected devices within the 28 to 35-day period \u2013 a mandate of recently introduce laws \u2013 and had not received a notice from ACMA.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo far, about 7500 devices already on the network which cannot be updated have been blocked by TPG, the inquiry was told.\n\nTPG has 5.5 million customers in Australia on their mobile network.\n\nOnly 550 had taken up the offer of a free replacement device, the inquiry was told.\n\nThe inquiry was told TPG was poised to sign a memorandum of understanding with Telstra and Optus which would see the telecom giants provide mutual assistance to \u201csupport each other actively when there are disasters and other emergency situations\u201d.\n\nSamsung head of mobile experience Eric Chou said, overall, about 60,000 Telstra and 28,000 Optus devices also needed an update.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe told the inquiry the hardware giant was confident all affected models had been identified.\n\n\u2018First time we\u2019ve seen this happen\u2019\n\nThe inquiry is also examining an September 18 outage of Optus triple-0 services that has been linked to the deaths of at least three people.\n\nThe cause of the outage and the role of the Communications Minister, ACMA, and the federal government play in ensuring access to emergency communications will all be looked at.\n\nNokia Oceania managing director Andrew Cope said the network firewall upgrade contracted by Optus involved a process known as an SBG lock, which \u201cwe completed and unfortunately resulted in the outcome that we are now investigating\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMr Cope said all calls were expected to be diverted in using this method.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, they did not divert because of a way that the triple-0 calls are configured,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen this happen through this process.\u201d\n\nGreens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young pressed Mr Berroeta on why those 8000 devices had not been replaced by TPG. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nMr Cope said: \u201cWe were given an instruction to perform and we executed it with a procedure that we know works, and has worked in the past \u2026 we had no indication they would not work this time.\u201d\n\nHe confirmed the procedure would not be used in the future.\n\n\u201cAll upgrades are scrutinised closely and carefully, and we follow known procedures,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, as such, there\u2019s no immediate, obvious negligence or inappropriate behaviour.\n\n\u201cWhile people are being assessed and procedures are being strengthened and we\u2019re finding ways to avoid this, we\u2019re also going through the process with Optus of understanding exactly what happened in the decision process and what happened in the governance process, and subject to that independent investigation findings, we will then, at that time, take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nMr Cope said some no disciplinary action had been taken against staff, adding some of those involved were \u201cquite distressed by what\u2019s happened\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re, of course, taking relevant, compassionate leave around that (and) others are providing evidence,\u201d he said.\n\nOptus chief executive Stephen Rue was grilled last month by the inquiry on who knew what and when.\n\nHe told the inquiry Optus was informed of the first fatality at 8.43pm on 18 September, with senior management told after midnight.\n\nMr Rue became aware of the information about 8am the following morning, but did not contact either the government regulator or the Communications Minister until about 2.30pm.\n\nHe admitted there were delays, but that his team were gathering information and making welfare checks before 2.30pm.\n\nThe outage affected services across Western Australia, South Australia, and border communities in NSW.",

(Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nThe PNG leader was wrong-footed by a goosestep from colourful ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys, who said rugby league would be a tool to repel Chinese influence.\n\n\"Having rugby league there for the community as a whole - taking the kids to school, bringing all the people together like a glue,\" Mr V'landys said on Tuesday.\n\n\"No matter how much investment China makes in PNG, it can never achieve that.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"You can never achieve the heart and soul and brain of the PNG person - and we can in sport.\"\n\nMr Marape hurriedly stepped in to affirm support for critical Chinese investment in his country.\n\n\"I want to quickly say a word or two, a big thank you to China and all our bilateral partners,\" he interrupted.\n\nDivisions at home and abroad are the last thing Mr Marape is hoping for from the team's historic entry into the NRL in 2028, saying he wants the Chiefs to be a \"national unity project\".\n\nHowever, it's plain that Australia - which is spending $600 million on the team - hopes the Chiefs will give a diplomatic boost with PNG at Beijing's expense.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMr Albanese hailed the Chiefs as an opportunity for education investment across the largely rural nation.\n\n\"Prospects of representing the Chiefs in the NRL when (PNG kids) grow up will encourage education, because (they will) have to be at school to play,\" the prime minister said.\n\nUnder Mr Albanese, Australia has made vast commitments to deepening the trans-Torres relationship.\n\nThe recent Pukpuk treaty, which elevates PNG to Austalia's third defence ally, will drastically increase defence co-operation.\n\nAustralia is also investing heavily in PNG infrastructure projects, Anthony Albanese says. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nAustralia maintains a high level of development aid for its northern partner, which includes climate financing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAustralia was also investing hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure projects such as ports and highways designed to help diversify the traditionally resources-heavy PNG economy, Mr Albanese said.\n\nThe PNG leader wasn't short of a rhetorical flourish of his own though, enticing the hundreds of companies in attendance with a substantial offer.\n\n\"When the economy hits 200 billion kina ($A71 billion), I will drop corporate tax,\" the leader of the 135 billion kina economy said to wrap up his speech.\n\nAs to who would eventually coach the much-anticipated NRL team, Mr V'landys ensured Panthers multi-premiership-winning mentor Ivan Cleary would have an awkward few days ahead.\n\n\"I'll say something controversial - there's a reason why the prime minister was at Penrith,\" he said.",
