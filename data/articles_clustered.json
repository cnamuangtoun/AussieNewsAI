    "text": "Australia's largest airline has been ordered to pay a landmark penalty of $90 million for what has been dubbed the largest case of illegal sackings in the country's history.\n\nQantas outsourced more than 1800 baggage handlers, cleaners and ground staff in 2020, in a move the Federal Court ruled was designed to curb union bargaining power in wage negotiations.\n\nThe embattled airline's appeal to the High Court was unsuccessful, paving the way for the penalty to be awarded on Monday.\n\nQantas will cop a heavy fine today for illegally sacking more than 1800 workers. (Wolter Peeters/SMH)\n\nThe Transport Workers Union sought the maximum penalty of $121 million, while Qantas urged Justice Michael Lee to impose a \"mid-range\" penalty between $40 million and $80 million.\n\nThe Federal Court judge cited the \"sheer scale of the contraventions, being the largest of their type\" as a reason to impose a penalty that would deter other businesses from similar conduct.\n\nHe ordered Qantas to pay $90 million in penalties, $50 million of which is to be paid directly to the union that brought the proceedings and highlighted the illegal conduct.\n\n\"To deprive someone of work illegally is to deprive someone of an aspect of their human dignity, and this is not assuaged simply by expressions of regret,\" Justice Lee said.\n\nFormer Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce. (Janie Barrett)\n\nHe was scathing about the embattled airline's conduct after the outsourcing, pointing to efforts to place a \"less than candid\" picture of the outsourcing decision before the court.\n\nHe noted Qantas had apologised publicly but then had attempted to deny any compensation payments to the affected workers.\n\nQantas will have to pay the hefty bill on top of a $120 million compensation payment it has made to the affected ground staff for their economic loss, pain and suffering following the outsourcing.\n\nHowever, Justice Lee said he didn't have enough evidence to be convinced those payments would be made.\n\nThe court was told the scandal-plagued airline began to finally accept responsibility for its actions in 2023, Justice Lee noted, which coincided with the departure of former CEO Alan Joyce.\n\nThe courtroom was packed with union members and representatives, who hugged and exchanged smiles after Justice Lee handed down his decision.\n\nIt comes after Qantas also sold tickets to cancelled flights for several years, triggering more legal turmoil and a $100 million fine after it was sued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.",

    "text": "Airline giant Qantas will face a $90 million penalty over its decision to illegally outsource more than 1,800 ground handling jobs during the COVID pandemic.\n\nFederal Court Justice Michael Lee said on Monday the penalty must \"bear some resemblance\" to the maximum $121 million \u2014 and should be no less than $90 million, which is 75 per cent of the maximum.\n\nHe said $50 million of the penalty should be paid to the Transport Workers Union (TWU).\n\nHow the remaining $40 million balance will be paid - and whether it will go to workers - will be decided at a later hearing.\n\nIt follows a 2020 decision by Qantas to outsource its ground handling workforce, which the Federal Court later found to be illegal.\n\nThe TWU had called for the airline to be fined a maximum of $121 million, in addition to the $120 million in compensation it's required to pay the affected employees.\n\nQantas had argued the court instead impose a \"mid-range\" penalty between $40 million and $80 million.\n\nJustice Lee said Qantas had shown the \"wrong kind of sorry\", whereby it worried more about the impact on the company rather than the impact the case had on the illegally sacked workers.\n\nHe noted that that the airline's chief people officer, Catherine Walsh, apologised for the company's behaviour during hearings, but \"it seemed to be obvious that the person who could give the most direct and compelling evidence of corporate change and contrition\" was CEO Vanessa Hudson.\n\nQantas CEO Vanessa Hudson has apologised to sacked workers but only after Qantas mounted legal action and lost. (AAP: Bianca De Marchi)\n\n\"I accept that Miss Walsh is a sincere and competent professional who will do her personal best to prevent a re-occurrence of contravening conduct. As the person responsible for industrial relations, she now reports directly to the CEO,\" Justice Lee said.\n\n\"But given the extent of the cultural problem revealed by this case, I would have been much more persuaded (about) the genuineness of contrition if her evidence had been supplemented by a member of senior management who was present when the proposal was socialised and evaluated, and explained why things went so wrong, how they had been converted in new ways of doing things, and how lessons have been learnt.\n\n\"Time will only tell whether the undoubted good intentions of Miss Walsh will prevail. The scope of the task \u2026 not to be underestimated.\n\n\"The strategy adopted by Qantas at the compensation hearing rather suggested an industrial relations culture that has very deep, very deep roots. Despite high level representations of change following the departure of some key personnel in 2023.\"\n\nJustice Lee said while Qantas ended up later expressing \"genuine regrets\", that \"this more likely reflects the damage this case has done at the company rather than unique remorse for the damage done to the affected workers\".\n\nHe said the airline \"resisted until it could resist no more\".\n\n\"And, as on multiple occasions prior to this hearing, sought to explain the way as representing no moral or ethical failure.\"\n\nRecord penalty shows 'courts won't tolerate blatant attacks on workers' rights'\n\nMaurice Blackburn Lawyers principal Josh Bornstein said the penalty is the biggest ever ordered by a court for violations of industrial relations laws in Australian history, and meant corporate Australia was on notice that courts \"would not tolerate blatant attacks on workers' rights\".\n\n\"This record-breaking penalty reflects the monumental scale of Qantas's wrongdoing and the court's concern that Qantas and the business community need to understand that calculated, mass violations of workplace laws may result in severe financial punishment,\" Mr Bornstein said.\n\nMichael Kaine and Josh Bornstein outside the court. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nHe said Qantas, under former CEO Alan Joyce's leadership, \"seized the opportunity presented by the COVID pandemic to realise its long-held aim \u2014 to rid its operations of the TWU and its members working as baggage handlers and ground staff\".\n\n\"This was a carefully planned and executed union-busting operation,\" Mr Bornstein said.\n\n\"Qantas worked for months on its plan to try and avoid an adverse outcome in a legal challenge. Qantas tried to hide the involvement of Alan Joyce in the plan. The plan fell apart once Qantas had to hand over documents and its executives were cross examined in the Federal Court.\"\n\nHe said the payment of the penalty to the TWU reflects the risks it took to pursue the case on behalf of its members and other employees of Qantas, and \"should encourage others to pursue compliance with industrial relations laws\".\n\nTWU national secretary Michael Kaine said in 2020 more than 1,800 Qantas workers took on a \"huge and audacious battle\" against the airline.\n\n\"Today's decision is a final win for both those workers and the tens of thousands of other TWU members who backed them every step of the way,\" he said.\n\n\"These were committed Qantas workers who had done nothing wrong and had loyally served this company, in many cases for decades.\n\n\" They [Qantas workers] weren't just sacked, they were told by Qantas that they were delusional for questioning it. This ruthless, self-interested and illegal calculation to kick them to the curb has rightfully merited the largest ever penalty of its kind. \"\n\nHe said the $90 million penalty was a \"message to corporate Australia that workers will stand up for what's right\".\n\nLabor senator Tony Sheldon said the case \"now marks three major legal defeats for Qantas in recent years \u2014 a deeply damning pattern\".\n\n\"The courts have found it unlawfully stood down a union health and safety rep for raising COVID concerns, illegally sacked its ground crew, and now must be penalised for breaching the Fair Work Act,\" Senator Sheldon noted.\n\nIn May 2024, Qantas faced a $100 million penalty for misleading customers by selling tickets to flights that had already been cancelled. The airline was sued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\nIn November 2023, Qantas was found guilty of illegally standing down worker Theo Seremetidis who had raised concerns about COVID-19 risk to staff who were cleaning aircraft arriving from China in the early phases of the pandemic.",

The Tasmanian government will halt marine expansion of the salmon industry in local waterways while an independent review is ordered.\n\nSalmon farms continue to grapple with the bacterial disease piscirickettsia salmonis, which led to an unprecedented mass mortality event in 2024, with the government currently seeking emergency approval for a new antibiotic to tackle the disease.\n\nTassal diver Oliver Brewer said he and other workers will not shy away from a review, but \"being used as a political tool to appease Greens and Independents\" had brought uncertainty for them.\n\n\"I have full faith in my industry that it will do the right thing and any review will have a positive outcome,\" Mr Brewer said.\n\nMarine expansion of the salmon industry in Tasmania will be halted while the independent review takes place. (Supplied: Bob Brown Foundation)\n\nThe decision to review the industry and halt its growth comes after a letter Premier Jeremy Rockliff sent to the industry on July 2, which said a re-elected Liberal government would \"not introduce moratoriums, bans or arbitrary caps on industry growth and will consider the science and sustainability of any proposal\".\n\nThe letter also said the Liberals would \"not trade the salmon industry in any way, shape or form in order to retain government\".\n\nIt also follows last week's government announcement to phase out the greyhound industry \u2014 which came after the party said it was committed to \"support the longevity and sustainability of the racing industry\".\n\nMr Brewer said it was difficult to see broader support for his industry wane over recent years.\n\n\"It's always a shame to see that we're ridiculed for the work that we do, and our industry is ridiculed for the work that we do, and it's normally coming from a rather-baseless place where the science is not backing that up,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's always a shame to see that community support, you know, does dwindle sometimes.\"\n\nSalmon Tasmania chief executive John Whittington said he became aware that Mr Rockliff's position on salmon farming had changed the night before it was announced \u2014 calling it \"a shameless sellout\".\n\n\"The premier's words are worthless and clearly no industry is safe,\" Dr Whittington said.\n\nJohn Whittington says the \"shameless\" announcement shows the premier's words are \"worthless\".

What is a genuine trustworthy announcement from Labor to clean up fish farming?\"\n\n'Pause' doesn't go far enough\n\nThe Bob Brown Foundation's Alistair Allan urged that an \"unequivocal commitment\" was needed to remove fish farms from Tasmanian waterways.\n\nMr Allan said the review was a \"cynical ploy that does nothing to protect Tasmania's environment from the environmental nightmare that is fish farms\" \u2014 and Tasmanians had seen an industry \"pause\" before.\n\n\"In 2021 [Liberal MP] Guy Barnett announced a pause, [and then] 12 months later the expansion continues,\" he said.\n\nAlistair Allan says similar pauses have taken place in the past, with little benefit for Tasmania's marine environment. (Supplied: Bob Brown Foundation)\n\nMr Allan also cited a 2022 parliamentary inquiry report that recommended a pause on expansion and a reduction of inshore finfish farms, with priority given to \"ceasing operations in sensitive, sheltered and biodiverse areas\".\n\n\"This announcement does nothing to address that,\" Mr Allan said.\n\nLoading...\n\nIndependent MP Peter George, along with Independent MP Craig Garland, proposed the moratorium, and said he was still seeking more details on Mr Rockliff's plan.\n\n\"What we can't afford to do is have a pause, have an inquiry, and then have the government totally ignore it. We need to get some undertakings that this inquiry will be treated seriously and its recommendations acted on.\"\n\nMr George was asked to respond to workers upset at being used as \"a political tool\" in Tasmania's minority government, made up of largely progressive crossbenchers.\n\nPeter George wants to ensure the government doesn't \"totally ignore\" the findings and recommendations from the inquiry.

They've just slotted in really comfortably [and] haven't missed a beat.\n\n\"If you look at any of the kids that played on the weekend, especially the top-five picks, in any other draft [they] could've gone number one. So it's a wonderful group of players. We're very lucky.\"\n\nIn one of the biggest developments for AFLW talent, players now entering the system have not had interrupted pathways like the inaugural players, who had to stop playing between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\nSimilar to how Harley Reid, Nick Daicos and Will and Levi Ashcroft slotted straight into their respective teams, Kurdas said the high draft picks in the women's game were easing into senior football a lot easier than previous drafts.\n\n\"The under-18 system understands what's required at senior level and I think there's greater synergy, or more specific preparation now, for those players, too,\" Kurdas said.\n\n\"The other thing is these players have had a lifetime growing up watching AFLW. So, they've got a really good understanding of the standard that's required of them as they've grown up with the competition being present.\n\n\"Whereas your Darcy Vescios [Carlton inaugural player] never had a benchmark to aspire to because there wasn't a competition before them.\"\n\nVeteran commentator Kelli Underwood said on the broadcast for the Sydney Richmond clash that she felt for the Rising Star selection committee, which had its work cut out for it.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nKate McCarthy, who has been added to the All Australian selection panel this year, said selecting a Rising Star this season might be just as difficult, if not more, than the All Australian team.\n\n\"That's if the first round is anything to go by,\" McCarthy told ABC Sport.\n\n\"The most impressive element of these debutants is that they are competing against a number of girls who have played for nine years and they are holding their own. This is against bodies who have been in an AFLW system for nine preseasons.\n\n\"These debutants are girls who have had a footy in their hands their entire life. They have the ball on a string and have played their whole lives. It's so incredibly exciting.\"",

(Supplied: Helen Roebig)\n\nIt's a sweet reunion more than 100 years in the making.\n\n\" It's like the two buildings found each other again,\" Helen said. \"Now they can grow old together on the hill. \"\n\nAn old school and a forgotten church\n\nThe Roebigs, along with their daughter Jess Bickerstaff, run the Vanbery Cottage Host Farm near Mount Alford, just outside Boonah.\n\nThe old Tarome schoolhouse has been converted into a guest cottage on the property. (Supplied: Jess Bickerstaff)\n\nThe guest cottage \u2014 the former Tarome schoolhouse \u2014 had already been moved to its current site and renovated.\n\nSo when Jess spotted the old Tarome church for sale on Facebook Marketplace for $4,000, and announced that she'd bought it, the Roebigs jumped at the chance to bring it home and install it beside the old school building, despite not having seen it in person.\n\n\"They belonged together, Helen said.\n\n\" The school and the church were from the same little rural community, so it just felt right. \"\n\nAfter buying the old church, Jess Bickerstaff then had the task of relocating it to its present location at Mt Alford. (Supplied: Helen Roebig/ABC News: Chris Kimball)\n\nThe chapel that jam built\n\nRestoring a derelict church isn't cheap, especially one that has spent the past 50 years as a hay shed.\n\nSo, Helen and Jess decided to raise funds with what they had \u2014 a patch of rosella bushes and a family tradition of jam-making.\n\n\"We planted six bushes and made a few jars,\" Helen said.\n\nThey took them to markets and local shops, and sold them through a bush foods website as demand grew.\n\nHelen Roebig says making jam from rosella flowers is a family tradition. (ABC News: Chris Kimball)\n\n\"Now we've got 160 bushes, and everything we earned went into the chapel,\" Helen said.\n\n\" We treated ourselves to a coffee at the market once. That was it. \"\n\nThe Roebigs built their small business from the ground up: hand-picking the rosella buds, de-seeding them, and cooking every batch.\n\nJess and Daniel Bickerstaff have worked on the church renovation for years. (ABC News: Chris Kimball)\n\nThe profits covered timber, trades, windows, fittings and more.\n\n\"Between us, we've preserved jams, fruit, and now churches,\" Helen said.\n\nSo, what exactly is a rosella?\n\nRosellas are a bright red hibiscus flower with a tart, fruity pod used to make everything from jam to cordial and tea.\n\nPopular in Queensland backyards for generations, they're rich in vitamin C and antioxidants.\n\nRosella jam used to be a staple in many homes back in the day. (ABC News: Chris Kimball)\n\nHelen remembers rosellas being used for bartering on the family farm in Mulgowie, in the Lockyer Valley, where she grew up.\n\n\"Everyone had them,\" she said. \"My sisters would peel them and make jam. I was the youngest, so I got out of most of the work.\"\n\nJess picked up the tradition years later while living in England, where she loved to forage for berries and experiment with making preserves.\n\nHelen said that so far this season, they had picked more than 400 kilograms of rosellas, which they have turned into jam, syrup, paste, topping, dried flowers and tea.\n\nEven the copper de-seeder tool Terry designed as the rosella business took off is now sold at local markets.\n\n'That history would have been lost'\n\nThe church hadn't had a roof since a storm tore it off in the late 60s. Rebuilding it on a windswept hill was no small job, but the Roebigs found help in local builder Shane Goulding.\n\n\"When he walked inside and said it was always his dream to restore a chapel, I knew we'd found the right person,\" Helen said.\n\nThe church before and after the renovations. (Supplied: Helen Roebig)\n\nNothing in the old building was square, so Terry got to work restoring doors and windows, many of which were salvaged from knockdowns and timber recycling outlets.\n\n\"When the girls bought the church, I thought, not again,\" he said. \"We'd already restored a house in Brisbane.\n\n\" I figured my renovation days were behind me. \"\n\nSlowly, piece by piece, the chapel came back to life.\n\nIt's taken four years and hundreds of jars of jam to complete the chapel renovations. (Supplied: Jess Bickerstaff)\n\n\"Had it not come here, that history would've been lost,\" Terry said.\n\n\"It might've ended up in Brisbane, but it belonged here.\"\n\nLove story blossoms\n\nJess had only been dating her then-boyfriend Dan for two weeks when she told him she'd bought a church.\n\n\"It didn't scare him off,\" Helen said.\n\n\"A year later, they were engaged, and the next April they got married in it.\"\n\nEven though the church was still a work in progress, Jess and Dan were married in it. (Supplied: Jess Bickerstaff)\n\nAt the time, the building still had no roof. The floor was stained. Guests sat on hay bales.\n\n\"But we had 90 people standing inside,\" Helen said.\n\n\" And why not, when you've got your own church? \"\n\nA sweet success\n\nThe restored chapel now welcomes visitors from across the country and overseas.\n\nSome come for the views, others for a quiet getaway. A few help pick rosellas or just chat over a cuppa.\n\nNew season of Shaun Micallef's Eve of Destruction Photo shows Shaun Micallef is holding 2 chairs from an explosion he survived from with a purple background, the title and ABC iview logo. Micallef is back with a new season from Wednesday, August 13 at 8.30pm on ABC TV and ABC iview.\n\nHelen said the decision to share the property was never difficult.\n\n\"We had neighbours on both sides for 38 years in Brisbane,\" she said. \"Now, if someone's staying 100 metres away, that's not hard.\"\n\nAs for Terry, he still gets a kick out of watching people discover what they've built.\n\nTerry Roebig says his renovation days are over. (ABC News: Chris Kimball)\n\n\"It's pleasing on the eye, and it's something that'll last,\" he said.\n\nAnd the jam? There's always more on the way.\n\n\"Whatever grows on the trees,\" Terry said, \"they turn into jam.\"",

    "text": "Lee accepted that Qantas was sorry for the illegal outsourcing, but he wasn\u2019t convinced the measure of regret was \u201csignificant\u201d and described it as \u201cthe wrong kind of sorry\u201d. He pointed to efforts within Qantas to obscure the decision-making process for the firings, the willingness of Qantas to actively appeal the court\u2019s decisions before being able to fully review them, and the decision not to have Vanessa Hudson, the former CFO, testify in court. Hudson has been CEO since Joyce stepped down in 2023. On the $90 million penalty he ordered Qantas to pay the TWU, Lee said: \u201cIt does not strike me as intuitively wrong that greater rewards might be appropriate for circumstances of greater risk.\u201d The payment of at least a large part of the penalty to the union was \u201cwarranted\u201d, he said, adding that he was \u201csatisfied that such a course will facilitate and promote the specific and general deterrence\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will send a message to Qantas and well-resourced employers that, not only will they face potentially significant penalties for the breach of the [Fair Work] Act, but those penalties will be provided to trade unions to resource those units to fulfil their statutory roles as enforcers of the Act,\u201d he said. The decision was announced at a Federal Court hearing on Monday, following a verdict in the Federal Court in December. Qantas is yet to comment on the penalty. The TWU had sought the maximum penalty of $121 million, while Qantas was seeking a fine between $40 million and $80 million. The union had asked to be the recipient of the full sum. The case marks a significant win for the TWU at a time when the conditions of wages and work are being debated in the post-COVID economy. Qantas aircraft stand on the tarmac at Sydney Airport during the COVID lockdown in 2020. Credit: Bloomberg\n\nThe penalty is in addition to the $120 million Qantas has already agreed to pay in compensation to the illegally fired workers. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a final win for both those workers and the tens of thousands of other TWU members who backed them every step of the way. \u201cThey weren\u2019t just sacked, they were told by Qantas that they were delusional for questioning it,\u201d Kaine continued. \u201cThis ruthless, self-interested and illegal calculation to kick them to the curb has rightfully merited the largest ever penalty of its kind.\n\nLoading \u201cQantas is only sorry now that it has to pay the largest penalty fine of any employer in Australian corporate history.\u201d Stephen Smith, principal of Actus Workplace Lawyers, which specialises in employment law said: \u201cThe sheer size of the penalty awarded to the TWU in this case will no doubt encourage the TWU and other unions to pursue speculative claims against employers.\u201d In the future, Smith said unions will be able to pursue much larger maximum penalties because civil penalties under the Fair Work Act have recently increased.\n\nAfter the 2020 sackings, the TWU immediately challenged the decision in court, and it was found the following year that Qantas had acted illegally \u201cin part motivated by a desire to prevent the employees taking protected industrial action in the future\u201d. Former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. Credit: Eamon Gallagher Qantas appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which unanimously dismissed it, in a win for the TWU. In December 2024, Qantas agreed with the TWU to pay $120 million in compensation to the 1820 ground staff whose contracts were terminated, including 1700 workers who lost their jobs outright, as well as 120 who were redeployed within Qantas but suffered non-economic losses.",

Seems everyone\u2019s trying to \u2018do a Centra\u2019\n\nCollingwood rookie and last year\u2019s No.1 draft pick Ash Centra might have only had three touches during her debut, but the young gun still managed to kick a goal. However, it was her pre-game actions on Thursday night that had everyone talking.\n\nCentra skilfully bounced the footy between her legs like a basketball, inspiring many others (including Hawthorn coach Sam Mitchell and Pies men\u2019s players Nick Daicos, Jack Crisp and Darcy Cameron) to try and mimic the tricky move.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s [Centra] got a cult-following,\u201d Collingwood coach Sam Wright said after their loss to Carlton.\n\n\u201cEvery time, she got the ball \u2026 you could hear the crowd. I just think it\u2019s so great for our game. I mean, the long sleeves, you see her coming from a mile away.\n\n\u201cI was really happy for her that she kicked that goal, she\u2019s going to be a serious player.\u201d\n\n2. \u2018I\u2019ll wear a helmet and a ski mask\u2019: Harris jokes after eye injury\n\nTayla Harris wasn\u2019t in the game long before suffering an eye injury but did have time to take a trademark speccy. Credit: Getty Images\n\nStar Melbourne ruck-forward Tayla Harris says she is \u201c100 per cent good to go\u201d for the rest of the season after suffering an eye injury during Saturday night\u2019s clash against the Bulldogs.\n\nAfter pulling off a trademark speccy just moments earlier, Harris copped an arm to her face in a marking contest with Bulldogs counterpart Alice Edmond.\n\n\u201cI obviously had to go to hospital to get some expert opinion, and yeah, all good from that point of view, I\u2019ll get an appointment with the specialist ASAP and just clear up anything else and make a plan moving forward,\u201d Harris said on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m feeling good, obviously thankfully avoided anything major, but not ideal to poke yourself in the eye, I don\u2019t recommend it.\u201d\n\nHarris confirmed there was damage to her eyeball and said she was taking eye drops to accelerate the healing process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I\u2019m told,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs long as I can play, I\u2019ll be wearing whatever\u2019s needed, I\u2019ll wear a helmet and a ski mask if I need to.\u201d\n\n3. Snoop Dogg might commentate AFLW, but some aren\u2019t pleased\n\nAFL chief executive Andrew Dillon told Fox Footy on Thursday night that there were plans to have grand final pre-game performer Snoop Dogg involved in AFLW.\n\n\u201cSnoop has to bring it on grand final day but what he does in the lead-up is super important as well,\u201d Dillon said.\n\n\u201cWhether that is commentating on an AFLW game or not, I\u2019m not sure. But we want to get the game in front of him and get his thoughts.\u201d\n\nSnoop Dogg has been hired by the AFL to perform at the grand final on September 27. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHowever, Respect Victoria chair Kate Fitz-Gibbon, who was instrumental in the creation of Australia\u2019s National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children, described the AFL\u2019s choice of Snoop Dogg as a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d given his \u201cpublic history of boasting about violence against women\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is unfathomable that the AFL would deem this artist [as] an appropriate choice for its flagship event,\u201d Fitz-Gibbon said.\n\n\u201cSport has enormous power to influence culture. By elevating an artist with a track record of degrading women, the AFL risks sending the message that misogyny is entertainment.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n4. Molloy makes a stunning return\n\nChloe Molloy played a starring role in her long-awaited return to the AFLW, firing Sydney to a 20-point win over Richmond.\n\nThe Swans co-captain slotted four goals on return from a knee reconstruction. She tore her anterior cruciate ligament at training in September 2024 \u2013 just one game into last season.\n\nThe 26-year-old picked up where she left off, combining well with maturing midfielder Montana Ham (18 disposals, six score involvements) in front of 4126 fans.\n\n5. Zippy by name and nature: Young Swan stuns on debut\n\nAll eyes were on Swan debutant Zippy fish during Sydney\u2019s clash against Richmond on Friday night.

Croatia is closely monitoring Segecic, and has already poached another of Australia\u2019s rising stars, with goalkeeper Anthony Pavlesic - who, like Segecic, was born and raised in Sydney and played youth international football for Australia - electing earlier this year to represent the nation of his family\u2019s heritage. Pavlesic, 19, this week sealed a transfer from Bayern Munich to Croatian club NK Rudes, whose chairman is Josip Simunic, another born-and-bred Aussie who famously turned his back on the Socceroos. Meanwhile, Popovic\u2019s policy of refusing to \u201csell\u201d the Australian jersey to players eligible to represent other countries may have cost him another top talent in Sunderland\u2019s Nectar Triantis, the former Central Coast Mariners star who has had his switch from Australia to Greece approved by FIFA.

The last time Popovic spoke to Australian media, he warned that the country\u2019s budding young stars had to \u201cearn\u201d their call-ups, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not about, \u2018OK, I heard some guy scored two goals and yeah, great, we\u2019ll just give them a call to the national team.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t go like that.\u201d\n\nLosing Segecic, if it were to happen, would sting even more because he is a rare talent in a part of the field where the Socceroos desperately need new impetus. In fact, it could be argued that Segecic - who finished tied with former Adelaide United striker Archie Goodwin for the A-League\u2019s golden boot last season - is the most in-form Australian attacker anywhere in the world. He has had a direct hand in all three of the goals scored by Portsmouth so far this term, his latest involvement being a spectacular strike from outside the box to claw one back in a 2-1 defeat to Norwich City. For those who watched him in the A-League, it was a familiar highlight, with Segecic possessing the sort of swagger that makes him unafraid to swing his dangerous left foot at distance if the opportunity presents itself. \u201cI feel like these days, a lot of young kids don\u2019t believe in themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more robotic ... you don\u2019t see the old-fashioned No.10 types. As a young player coming through, the hardest thing is to have confidence and believe in yourself. I feel like if you tell yourself you\u2019re going to go out there, and you\u2019re going to do it, and you\u2019ve put the hard work in, there\u2019s a good chance that it can happen. If you don\u2019t back yourself, and you don\u2019t take that shot, you\u2019re never going to score \u2026 if you do, it could be the difference in the game.\u201d\n\nThere will be an immense sense of pride in Segecic\u2019s journey from a Sydney FC perspective, given he joined the club\u2019s academy at the age of 12, but also pain. Firstly, because the Sky Blues won\u2019t be able to cash in on Segecic\u2019s rise because they lost him to Portsmouth on a free transfer, pocketing under $1 million in training compensation for him, with no sell-on clauses retained - and secondly, because his trajectory suggests that had coach Ufuk Talay started him more often last season, they might have made the A-League finals. Loading He has signed a three-year deal with Portsmouth, and their decision to hand him the coveted No.10 jersey is a sign of the high esteem held in him by manager John Mousinho, who has scoured the A-League for diamond-in-the-rough recruits. Three other Australians are also at the club: Segecic\u2019s former Sydney FC teammate Hayden Matthews, ex-Brisbane Roar striker Thomas Waddingham and Central Coast Mariners product Jacob Farrell. \u201cHe must love the A-League,\u201d Segecic said. \u201cFrom the minute I spoke to him, I just felt like that\u2019s a manager I\u2019d love to play under. He gave me goosebumps. It\u2019s someone that you\u2019d love to fight for and do well for. He said he saw me playing in that No.10 role, and like you saw in the A-League, that\u2019s where I can cause the most damage. As soon as he said that, that was me sold.\u201d",

    "text": "Daily weekday trips at North Sydney station have more than halved to 12,200, while patronage at St Leonards has fallen by a third, and by more than a tenth at Wynyard and Town Hall. Sydney transport expert Mathew Hounsell said the metro line had proven to be \u201cabsolutely world beating\u201d in how it had encouraged people to use it consistently. \u201cIt helped bring the city back from the edge after COVID because you now have the whole northwest and north shore able to get into the city quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should serve as an example for the whole country that if you build frequent, reliable transport, people will use it.\u201d\n\nCrows Nest resident Charlie Smith said the metro was \u201clife-changing\u201d for his commute between work, home and university. \u201cIt\u2019s just so convenient to get everywhere, and the stations are so pretty. It\u2019s so fast and comes every four minutes \u2013 it\u2019s 10 minutes into the city, 10 minutes to Macquarie Uni where I study, and it\u2019s just perfect,\u201d he said. Martin Place metro station is consistently surpassing patronage forecasts. Credit: Sam Mooy Commuters will have to wait until at least April next year for the M1\u2019s final stage between Sydenham and Bankstown to open, which has been blamed on the complexity of converting the old T3 heavy rail line to metro train standards and disruptions from industrial action. Regan said a higher frequency of services than on the former T3 rail line, together with much faster journeys between Sydenham and the CBD and north shore, was forecast to boost patronage on the M1 line.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s quite asymmetrical. The patronage in the morning peaks is very heavily from the north, and less coming up from Sydenham,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cBut once the Bankstown line is opened, it will be much more balanced because you\u2019ll have an extra 10 stations picking up people from the south.\u201d Regan said it was expected to lead to similar passenger loads on the M1 line to and from the south-west to what was already experienced on services between the northwest and the CBD. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a very balanced load in both directions,\u201d he said. While Martin Place and Gadigal have surpassed expectations, Waterloo and Crows Nest stations continue to lag patronage forecasts.\n\nAt Waterloo, planned development around the station has been slower than originally forecast. \u201cIn COVID, everyone got a bit nervous about commercial so they switched it to [residential],\u201d Regan said. \u201cNow they\u2019re looking at the timing of it. Some of the development directly on our site has taken longer.\u201d Loading Similarly, at Crows Nest, it has taken time for some developments along the Pacific Highway to be completed. \u201cYou can really see it starting to accelerate now, and the housing developments directly above the station are now being marketed,\u201d Regan said. Trains run every four minutes in both directions on the M1 line during weekday peaks between about 7am and 10am, and from 3pm to 7pm. They operate every five minutes from 10am to 3pm, and every 10 minutes at other times. Regan said a boost to train frequencies before 7am on weekdays was \u201cdefinitely an option\u201d if patronage kept growing, and was possible with the existing 45-strong fleet.",

    "text": "It's common to feel tired and apprehensive on a Monday morning, and that can be especially true after a big weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research has mapped how people's quality of sleep changes throughout the week, and has found patterns between fatigue and behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's estimated around one billion people worldwide have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a condition that impacts their quality of sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian researchers have found this underlying condition is more prevalent on weekends than on weekdays, and they have labelled this phenomenon \u2014 'social apnoea'.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How seasons and even days of the week impact sleep\n\nIt can affect anyone, even if you don't typically show symptoms of OSA during the week.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why is that the case?\n\n\n\n'Social jet lag'\n\nProfessor Danny Eckert, a sleep health expert from Flinders University, was one of the lead researchers in the study that was published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe described social apnoea as a kind of \"social jet lag\", a feeling that can arise after the weekend, when our behaviours often differ from those on weekdays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that people who smoke tend to smoke more on the weekend. We know that people who drink tend to drink more on the weekend,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are two sort of lifestyles or social factors if you like, that are very influential in the way we sleep and breathe.\"\n\n\n\nEckert said another key change in weekend behaviour is that our sleep patterns often change, which can cause problems with our sleep quality and overall mood.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who sleep in on weekends were found to have a 50 per cent higher risk of developing a sleep disorder, according to the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our circadian rhythm, or our body clock, is slow to move; it takes several days to adjust,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if we suddenly change our sleep timing, and we've all experienced this at different times with jet lag and these kinds of things, we're sleeping out of whack from what our body wants us to.\"\n\n\n\nWhat are the long-term effects?\n\nWeekend surge in sleep-disordered breathing may heighten the risk of serious health conditions, according to the research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes heart disease, depression, dementia, and extreme fatigue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research found people under 60 and males were two groups more likely to suffer from social apnoea. While the exact reason is unclear, Eckert said it's likely due to behavioural factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that men tend to be drinking more alcohol than women and perhaps they're having later nights and going to sleep after women,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also know that men get sleep apnoea more, so they are more prone to 'social apnoea' in the first place.\"\n\n\n\nEckert said beyond seeking clinical treatment for sleep apnoea, there are some lifestyle changes you can make to combat social apnoea. In particular, going to bed and waking up at consistent times can help establish a healthier sleep pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If people are feeling tired during the day, having some trouble staying asleep, or maybe they are waking up with morning headaches, maybe they're being told that they snore loudly; these are all warning signs that you may have sleep apnoea, and it's worth having a conversation with your GP.\"\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied / \u00c1rp\u00e1d Aged Care In Australia, around 185,00 people aged 65 and over are currently living in residential aged care facilities across the country. Despite improvements to aged care facilities following the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, rates of malnutrition are still high, with one 2024 study from Griffith and Monash Universities suggesting four in 10 residents are still not getting enough nutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as our diverse population ages, there is growing awareness that culturally appropriate food can make a significant contribution to improving rates of malnutrition, while also increasing overall wellbeing and quality of life.\n\n\n\nMeals that spark joy\n\nIn 2021, the royal commission stated that access to adequate food is a fundamental human right. Its final report identified food quality as a key problem requiring immediate attention, citing one Victorian study that found 68 per cent of homes surveyed had residents who were malnourished or at risk of malnourishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCherie Hugo is the founder of Lantern Alliance, which is dedicated to improving the quality of life for older Australians through food. She says that four years on from the report, and despite many positive government initiatives driving improvement in the sector, the problem of malnutrition is still \"way bigger than it should be\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's so many reasons why malnutrition is important. It increases health complications. It increases the risk of fall by eight times. It increases pressure injuries, hospitalisations, infections and cognitive decline,\" she says.\n\n\n\nHugo says budget constraints play a role, as does a lack of training for kitchen staff. But one overlooked factor is how dietary requirements change as we get older.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"An older person's protein needs are on par with what you would see for an athlete. But the problem that also happens as we get older is our appetites decrease. So the problem is they're needing more protein, but not feeling as hungry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue was highlighted this week by Maggie Beer at a speech given at the National Press Club. The famous former chef was inspired to start the Maggie Beer Foundation to advocate for improved nutrition after visiting a number of facilities where she was \"often appalled\" by the food that was served there.\n\n\n\nFormer chef Maggie Beer spoke at the National Press Club on Wednesday where she described seeing \"appalling\" food being served in some aged care facilities. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas \"What was missing was not only the joy in food, but the real belief in most places that beautiful food will make such a difference to the wellbeing of residents and pride of the teams,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeer said that some of the best food she's eaten in aged care facilities were ones with strong links to countries with vibrant food cultures, such as the Italian, Greek and Vietnamese communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo agrees that enjoyable food that connects with a person's cultural identity is a \"huge uplift to resident satisfaction\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Food is a reflection of identity, it triggers memories, particularly when you have residents living with dementia. It's something that can bring that spark back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents are also more likely to finish a meal and subsequently not lose weight, which Hugo says is crucial to older people's overall health as they age.\n\n\n\nMore than meatballs\n\nTasty and culturally appropriate food can bring other benefits too.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile living in an Italian-focused aged care facility during her PhD research, Hugo saw that a successful meal was about more than its nutritional content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember having a meatball dish that was just delicious. But the thing that hit me was that often in an aged care space, it\u2019s not a noisy space. But what really struck me at this one home were the animated conversations in Italian.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appeared people were shouting at each other but Hugo discovered it was a heated debate about what constitutes the perfect meatball recipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The food is there to nourish, but there's that social connection too. It's a social lubricant if you have a great meal or you see the menu displayed and people get excited, that in itself elicits conversation,\" she says.\n\n\n\nA traditional Hungarian sz\u00e9kelyk\u00e1poszta or sauerkraut goulash, where the fermented cabbage is cooked with the meat and served with a dollop of sour cream on top. Source: Supplied / \u00c1rp\u00e1d Aged Care Similarly, at the \u00c1rp\u00e1d facility in Melbourne, meal times are social events. Magdalena says that her daughter will often join her for dinner so they can enjoy the food together. They are planning to do so again next week for her 100th birthday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She has said to me she likes to come here and eat because it feels like being back home, like the restaurants in Budapest.\"\n\n\n\nRisottos against social isolation\n\nThere are also a growing number of culturally appropriate options catering to the older Australians who want to continue living independently at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Adelaide, not-for-profit initiative Nonna's Cucina delivers home-cooked Italian food to 500 clients.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO Marco Staltari says the service started 26 years ago out of concern for older members of the Italian community who were struggling to cook for themselves, and the meal services on offer \"didn\u2019t really suit Italian tastebuds\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey emphasise flavours that Italian migrants grew up with. Traditional creamy risottos cater to those with northern Italian heritage. For Italian Australians with heritage from the south, they prepare pipi e patate, a dish of capsicum and potatoes. They also provide texture-modified foods to support people who are at higher risk of choking.\n\n\n\nAdelaide-based charity Nonna's Cucina delivers 500 home-style Italian meals daily and helps to reduce social isolation for older members of the community staying at home. Source: Supplied / Nonna's Cucina \"When people are older and lose a bit of their memory, these flavours always bring you back to your home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir menu rotates every five weeks, which general manager Dario Fabretto says provides their clients more choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you get older and you can\u2019t cook for yourself as much anymore, you might feel a bit hard done by or that it\u2019s unfair that you can\u2019t cook. And then you get told what you have to eat. So we try to provide as much variety as we can,\" Dario says.\n\n\n\nA feeling of home\n\nHugo says that being able to choose your meals, and feeling as if your preferences are being listened to, makes a significant impact in the quality of life for older Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's about residents feeling like their preferences are heard and understanding that they feel safe and can share their feedback. [This] links to a sense of maintaining your agency and having a voice and input into your community ... It's what it is to be human.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack at \u00c1rp\u00e1d Aged Care in Melbourne, Eva says she values the familiarity of home-cooked Hungarian meals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you're young, you don't think about these things, but when you're getting older and your time is over, you are just looking for a place where you belong.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The topic of e-scooters is a difficult one for Michael Seculovic.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, he marked what would have been his daughter Ava's 15th birthday.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe died last year after being hit by a car while riding her e-scooter across a busy road in Perth.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her dad's mind, Ava will always remain that 13-year-old girl on the precipice of taking on the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe had recently started at a new high school, which Seculovic was chuffed about, as it was the same school he had attended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was a bright, beautiful girl,\" he tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nMichael Seculovic's daughter Ava was 13 years old when she died from severe head injuries sustained in an accident on her e-scooter. Source: Supplied / Michael Seculovic \"She was very friendly; it didn't matter who it was, when anyone came up to her and said 'hello, how are you?' she always replied with 'good, thank you. How are you?'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was just beautiful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAva had received her scooter as a Christmas present just a few months before the accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeculovic says he had nagged her and her friends to wear helmets many times, as required by state law in Western Australia, but it was often a struggle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't from a lack of trying, I had went and purchased another helmet, as she had said that she didn't like the one she had,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But also, no one else was wearing a helmet, and like many girls, they are worried about their hair.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Call for scooter ban after Brisbane death\n\nTragically, Ava wasn't wearing one at the time of the accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeculovic has spent the past year reflecting on the regulations around e-scooters. He admits he wasn't fully aware of the legalities before his daughter's death.\n\n\n\nI was just going about everyday life, that was not really ever in front of me to know about.\n\nFor young people, e-rideables, such as e-scooters and e-bikes, represent an affordable and accessible means of transport \u2014 they are significantly cheaper than a car and can be used without a licence. Seculovic says he felt it offered his daughter some much-needed independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was her second year of high school, and she just wanted to have that sort of independence teenagers want,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as the devices have become more and more popular in Australia, so has debate over how to regulate them.\n\n\n\nAre e-bikes and e-scooters safe?\n\nParliamentary inquiries into e-rideables are taking place in WA and Queensland, following a rise in related accidents. Both will consider the benefits of the devices against issues regarding safety, regulation, enforcement and penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NSW government announced this week it is considering a temporary ban on the devices on public transport, pending community feedback, following two incidents in NSW and Victoria earlier this year, which involved e-rideable batteries catching fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy director of Monash University's Accident Research Centre (ARC), Professor Jennie Oxley, says incident rates have risen as the number of e-rideable users has grown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rates of injuries and deaths are increasing, and a big part of that is exposure [in traffic and public spaces], because these e-rideables are becoming popular, of course we're going to see increased numbers of injuries,\" she says.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Making a short trip? Why mopeds could be better for the environment than electric cars\n\nComparable state-based statistics on e-scooter-related injuries are not readily available.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the ARC collects data on emergency department presentations and hospital admissions related to e-mobility devices, which Oxley says mirrors the situation across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Victoria, between July 2017 and June 2023, there were 1,680 emergency department presentations related to e-scooter injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the same period, e-scooter injury rates increased from 0.3 to 14.9 per 100,000 people, says Oxley, adding that the rate would likely have increased with the growth of e-scooter use over the past two years.\n\n\n\nThe Victorian data did not specifically break down deaths related solely to e-scooters; instead, it listed 14 deaths as a result of all e-mobility devices between 2016 and 2020, with half of these related to e-bikes, while the rest related to other self-balancing devices, including e-scooters.\n\n\n\n\n\nWA Police confirmed it had recorded one death related to e-scooters in 2023 and three in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a submission to the inquiry into e-mobility safety in Queensland, the Australian Centre for Health Law Research said e-scooter incidents had resulted in at least eight deaths in Queensland in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Between January 2021 and December 2024, 4,902 people presented to 31 Queensland participating emergency departments with injuries from e-scooter incidents, resulting in eight deaths in 2024 alone,\" it reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These figures likely underestimate the true toll, as not all Queensland hospitals contribute data, and not all injured individuals seek treatment.\"\n\n\n\nAs more people use e-scooters, the incidents related to riding them have increased. Source: AAP / Luka Coch The submission noted that common injuries include fractures, dislocations and head trauma.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeculovic's daughter Ava suffered serious head injuries as a result of her accident in March 2024, which she later succumbed to.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile laws in WA ban those under 16 from riding e-scooters on roads in Australia, it is not uncommon to see children in their early teens out and about in the suburbs of Perth on e-scooters.\n\n\n\nGrowing popularity of e-rideables\n\nDespite the risks, experts say e-rideables are here to stay.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 report by cycling advocacy group WeRide Australia found that 3.6 million Australians had used an e-scooter in 2022 and that per capita usage was highest in WA and the ACT.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increasing affordability of e-scooters in recent years has also fuelled growth in the number of Australians using them.\n\n\n\nWhile it is illegal to travel on an e-scooter with more than one person, it has become common practice to do so in some parts of Australia. Source: Getty / Steve Waters While some high-end models may set you back around $5,000, a new e-scooter can cost as little as $500.\n\n\n\n\n\nOxley says while e-rideables are largely used by people commuting to and from work or study, gig-economy workers, such as food and mail delivery drivers, also rely heavily on them.\n\n\n\nAround one in five Australians used an e-scooter in 2022. Source: SBS News Estimates compiled by University of Sydney professor of transport management Stephen Greaves indicate that Australians own about 400,000 personal e-scooters and mobility devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is in addition to the thousands of e-mobility devices operating via share-ride schemes, which have been implemented in every capital city and across more than 25 local government areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreaves says they are a \"genuine alternative to motorised transport\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"E-mobility devices, including scooters, open up the possibility for many of those trips that are maybe 2-5 kilometres, where you think, 'why are people driving cars for such distances?'\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Electric Vehicle Association president Chris Jones says the boom in electric personal mobility is transformative and should be supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are some of the most accessible and affordable electric vehicles in the world, and they take up a fraction of the space of a car,\" he says.\n\n\n\nWe should be encouraging their uptake with sensible regulation.\n\nA submission to the Queensland inquiry from Brisbane West Bicycle User Group said that Queensland and the Brisbane City Council local government area are \"failing to capitalise on the congestion-busting benefits of micromobility, and particularly the increased accessibility\" afforded by e-mobility options.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt pointed out that in Brisbane, 56 per cent of all trips across all modes of transport between 2021 and 2024 were less than 5km in distance and that 75 per cent of trips under 5km were taken by car.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group asked the inquiry to consider the benefits of e-mobility devices and their potential to replace the \"second or third family car\", which would \"have significant environmental benefits, both in terms of day-to-day emissions and pollution, but also reduced demand for road space and parking...\"\n\n\n\nInconsistent regulation\n\nFor the benefits of e-rideables to be fully realised, experts say better regulation needs to be enforced.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws vary state by state and are overdue for an update, says Greaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen e-scooters first entered the Australian market around 20 years ago, they fell into grey regulatory territory, he explains, as their integration into transport systems and roads had not been planned for.\n\n\n\n\"The origins of these rules came originally from AustRoads [a national agency representing state transport departments] ... They were talking about kids' scooters and skateboards and all those sorts of things,\" Greaves says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They classified them as recreational devices: the terminology was a 'wheeled recreational device' and it was then up to each state to figure out how they were going to manage that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreaves says the variation between states has implications for whether devices can be used on roads or footpaths, age limits and registration requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, in NSW, we're not sure where scooters belong \u2014 some people consider them a kid's toy, others think of them as more of a moped. But, of course, they are not roadworthy as a motorcycle, so are illegal.\"\n\n\n\nIt's all a mess.\n\nWhile the NSW and Northern Territory governments have implemented laws that prohibit using personal e-scooters on public roads and footpaths, most other states permit their use under certain circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nA driver's licence is not needed to ride an e-scooter in jurisdictions where they are permitted in public areas, but riders often need to be above a certain age.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn WA and Victoria, riders must be at least 16 years of age to use an e-scooter in public spaces.\n\n\n\nQueensland allows those aged 12-15 to ride them as long as they are accompanied by an adult, while the ACT does not stipulate a minimum age; however, those under 12 must be accompanied by an adult.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelmets are generally required by law for public use, and certain activities, such as riding with more than one person or with a mobile phone in one hand, are not allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also variations in enforceable speed limits. Riders in WA can travel on footpaths as long as they do not exceed 10km/h, while in Tasmania, it is 15km/h. It is illegal to ride an e-scooter on a footpath in Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some states, the maximum speed for e-scooters in public areas is 20km/h; elsewhere, it is capped at 25km/h.\n\n\n\nRiding context and speed\n\nGreaves argues that regulation needs to be \"context dependent\" and take into account riding locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the inner city of Sydney, we have a decent bike network, and we have relatively low usage of those bike lanes. They should be allowed and that's what people expressed when we surveyed on this,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think they're alright on local roads, where we are moving to the 40km/h default speed limits. I don't think they should be on main roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Outside of the CBD, I think they should be allowed on footpaths. You go out into the suburbs and you might see two people walking on a footpath, [so] you've got this perfect infrastructure for e-scooters; let's use it for e-scooters and make it a shared path.\"\n\n\n\nTransport management professor Stephen Greaves says the local context needs to be considered when it comes to e-scooter regulations. Source: Supplied He says local governments should be engaged to help determine safe and appropriate contexts for e-rideables \u2014 but also speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, the state tries to set blanket rules around everything, but at the end of the day, the local jurisdiction needs to tweak those rules depending on the situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March, Queensland Police warned consumers to be aware that some e-scooters being sold in Queensland exceeded the legal speed limits, which put them in a different category to personal mobility devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreaves says while imposing limitations on the speed of e-scooters might help to ensure those sold on the market comply with legal limits, he is aware that some e-scooter owners in Australia are making alterations to increase the speed of their devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very easy to override that,\" he says.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO New rules could soon ban charging of e-bikes in NSW apartments SBS News 00:50 English\n\nHe adds that implementing very low speed limits for e-scooters could take away their \"intrinsic appeal\" in helping people get from A to B faster than it would take to walk. It may also affect device operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you get below about 10 km/h it's actually quite hard to control it, it gets wobbly. There is a sort of sweet spot which is about 15km /h.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Jennie Oxley from Monash points out that is the increased speed of e-scooters over walking as well as the slower interactions with traffic that add to the risk of injury.\n\n\n\nCompliance of e-mobility devices\n\nOne of the recommendations to come from a 2024 report from Monash University's ARC on injuries associated with e-scooters, e-bikes and other e-mobility devices was to \"increase police enforcement\" in an effort to deter \"noncompliant riding behaviours\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News contacted police departments in each Australian state and territory to obtain recent data on e-ridable-related infringements; however, only WA and the ACT provided them.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw numbers in the nation's capital reflect similar patterns to those in WA.\n\n\n\n\n\nWA officers recorded 303 infringements in regard to e-mobility devices between January 2024 and 7 October 2024 (when responsibility of collection of data moved to the Department of Transport) and a total of 510 infringements in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 85 per cent of those were related to helmets, and about 5 per cent were in relation to speeding.\n\n\n\nLaws around the use of e-scooters and other e-rideables differ from state to state. Source: Getty / BJP7images A WA Police spokesperson told SBS News: \"As with any vehicle, speed, drug and alcohol use and a lack of helmet use are contributing factors to the causes of serious injury or death involving ERDs [e-rideable devices].\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While infringements are an appropriate deterrent, they are only issued when the irresponsible or reckless rider is caught at that moment in time. The most effective way to deter irresponsible, dangerous and reckless operation of ERDs is to seize and destroy the vehicles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March, Queensland Police made a public appeal for people to take personal mobility device laws seriously, noting that between November 2022 and December 2024, more than 2,700 infringements were issued to riders for illegal road use.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile e-bikes and e-motorbikes are categorised differently from e-scooters, there have been calls to mandate their registration and to legalise their use on roads.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Faulty e-bike battery sparks Sydney apartment evacuation\n\nGreaves says research has shown community support for some sort of registration, insurance and licensing of e-mobility devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a number of considerations to take into account, but such measures could potentially encourage more responsible ownership and riding,\" he says.\n\n\n\n'It really sucks'\n\nSeculovic remembers refusing to wear a helmet when riding his bike as a child, but strongly encourages anyone using an e-scooter to wear one.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says parents with teens in particular face a challenge around e-scooter use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you don't let them have one, do you then run the risk that they will then jump on the back of someone else's anyway?\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite his personal grief over his daughter's death, Seculovic says banning scooters outright is not realistic.\n\n\n\nLook at all the road accidents, you can't just ban cars, can you?\n\nWhen a workmate recently expressed feeling conflicted about whether to allow their son to get an e-scooter, his only advice was: \"Go take him down to Wanneroo Road [northern Perth], and see Ava's cross.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's the end result, which could happen.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of the high stakes meeting with Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump said he would know within two minutes of meeting the Russian leader whether it would be a success.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took almost three hours before the leaders emerged from the meeting behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the first face-to-face meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Putin since 2019, with the Russian leader ostracised by Western leaders since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter their meeting, Mr Trump and Mr Putin emerged to speak before reporters in Anchorage, but they took no questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe that we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many points that we agreed on - most of them. I would say. A couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there. But we have made some head way. There is no deal until there is a deal. I will call up NATO in a little while. I will of course call up President Zelenskyy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump later told Fox News that he rated the meeting a 10 out of 10 - even though he revealed no details of the points of agreement and disagreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is not that much. There is one or two significant items (of disagreement). But I think they can be reached. Not it is really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done. And I would also say the European nations. They have to get involved a little bit. But it is up to President Zelenskyy. And if they like, I will be at the next meeting. They are going to set up a meeting between President Zelenskyy, President Putin and myself, I guess. Not that I want to be there, but I want to make sure that it gets done. We have a pretty good chance of getting it done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a change in the tone Mr Trump had a few weeks ago when he issued a August 8 deadline for Mr Putin to show a genuine commitment to a ceasefire - or face stronger sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the post-meeting press conference, Mr Putin was keen to cast the meeting as a success for him - in receiving the invitation, but also on the prospect of a Russian-US economic reset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I expect that today's agreement will be the starting point - not only for the solution of the Ukrainian issue. But will also help us bring back business and pragmatic relations between Russia and the US.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he has not shifted in his position on the full-scale invasion in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're convinced that in order to make the settlement lasting long-term, we need to eliminate the primary roots, the primary causes of the conflict. And we have said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia and to reinstate a just balance of security in Europe - and in the world on a whole.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at the end of the press conference, Mr Putin was eager to secure another meeting with the US President.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: \"Thank you very much Vladimir.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVladimir Putin: \"Next time in Moscow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: \"Oh, that's an interesting one! I will get a little heat on that one but I could see it possibly happening. Thank you very much Vladimir. Thank you all! Thank you!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVladimir Putin: Thank you so much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Sussex is a fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there was a lot of theatre and optics involved in the high stakes visit - and Mr Putin got what he wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yes, it's certainly a win for Vladimir Putin. The optics of it were that, you know, he came to American territory, but American territory in Alaska, which of course previously was part of the Russian Federation and there was a lot of media talk in Russia and billboards going up saying, you know, Alaska is Russian and we will take that back. So he got a photo opportunity with Donald Trump. So it makes him look, look respected and valued and making the American president travel all the way to Anchorage to meet him. And at the same time, he basically dodges those sanctions that Trump had threatened.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Cancian is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says despite the convivial language between Mr Trump and Mr Putin, the Alaska summit was planned haphazardly from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The press conference was startling - even bizarre - in the sense that the meeting was expected to last maybe six hours and broke up after about three. Then the press conference was called very abruptly. The journalists race into the room. The parties come on stage and speak their piece. Putin starts off and Trump responds, and then they trip off after a couple of minutes, they take no questions and Putin gets on his airplane, flies away. And I don't think anyone quite expected a result like that. On the other hand, the words spoken were very friendly. Both Putin and Trump were encouraging about the future, but vague. And this is clearly the first step on, you know, what could be a long journey.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says negotiations to end wars can take a long time to finalise, but there is a positive for Ukraine in that the worst outcome was avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Another encouraging thing was Trump saying that the Europeans and Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, had to be part of this agreement, and that had not come through quite clearly again about a week ago. The concern is that the pressure will go on to Zelenskyy to give up territory, to make an end to the conflict and get it over with as Trump would say. The Ukrainians are very reluctant to give up territory.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUkrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he has been briefed on the Alaska meeting in a phone call with Mr Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe call also ended with an invitation for him to come to Washington DC on Monday (18 August local time).\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "One of the world\u2019s most dangerous water-borne microorganisms, commonly called a \"brain-eating amoeba\", has recently been detected in two drinking water supplies in south-west Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth affected towns are about 750 kilometres west of Brisbane: Augathella (population roughly 300) and Charleville (population 3,000).\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring an analysis of water samples commissioned by Queensland Health, Naegleria fowleri was detected in the water systems of two health facilities, one in Charleville and one in Augathella, as well as in the incoming town water supply at both facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shire Council of Murweh, which takes in the two affected locations, issued a health notice for residents and visitors on August 7 warning of the detection of N. fowleri in the water supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what is this organism? And how significant is the risk likely to be in these Queensland towns, and elsewhere?\n\n\n\nWhat is the brain-eating amoeba?\n\nThe N. fowleri amoeba is a microscopic organism found around the world. It only lives in warm freshwater, generally between 25 and 40\u00b0C. This can include ponds, lakes, rivers, streams and hot springs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf someone is infected with N. fowleri , it causes what\u2019s called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a serious infection of the brain.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Alana felt good about donating her eggs until she realised her sexuality was an issue\n\nSymptoms include a sore throat, headache, hallucinations, confusion, vomiting, fever, neck stiffness, changes to taste and smell, and seizures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incubation period of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis \u2014 the time between infection and symptoms appearing \u2014 typically ranges from three to seven days.\n\n\n\n\n\nTragically, this illness is nearly always fatal, even if someone receives medical attention quickly. Death typically occurs about five days after symptoms begin.\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately though, cases are very rare. In the United States, there were 167 reported cases of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis between 1962 and 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only four survived.\n\n\n\n\n\nA global review of the disease up to 2018 reported that, of 381 known cases, Australia accounted for 22, the fifth highest number, after the US, Pakistan, Mexico and India. Some 92 per cent of people died.\n\n\n\nHow do people get infected?\n\nThe route of infection is very unusual and quite specific. N. fowleri infects the brain through a person\u2019s nose. The amoeba then passes through a protective membrane called the nasal epithelium.\n\n\n\nThis is an important physical barrier and allows the amoeba to travel to the brain through the olfactory nerve, which is responsible for our sense of smell. The infection then kills brain tissue and causes swelling of the brain, termed cerebral oedema.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfections occur in people when infected water travels up their nose. Most cases involve children and young people who have swum in infected waters. The majority of cases occur in males, with an average age of 14.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven water sports in affected waterways can be dangerous. A person is currently in intensive care in Missouri after it\u2019s believed they became infected while water skiing.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the recent detection in Queensland water supply systems, the source of the infection has not been reported. It\u2019s possible a fresh waterway, or groundwater, which feeds into the affected drinking water systems, was contaminated with N. fowleri , and the amoeba travelled from there. But this will likely be determined with further investigation.\n\n\n\nIs it dangerous in drinking water?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to note you can\u2019t get primary amoebic meningoencephalitis from drinking contaminated water.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut any activity that allows infected water to enter a person\u2019s nose is potentially dangerous. This can happen during a bath or a shower.\n\n\n\nSome people flush their nasal passages to clear congestion related to allergies or a viral infection. This has been linked to infections with N. fowleri . If you\u2019re going to flush your nasal passages, you should use a sterile saline solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven young children playing with hoses, sprinklers or water activities could be at risk. A 16-month-old child was fatally infected following an incident involving a contaminated water \"splash pad\" in the US in 2023. Splash pads are water-based recreation activities, primarily for young children, that involve splashing or spraying water.\n\n\n\nWhat is the risk in Queensland?\n\nRegarding N. fowleri , Australian drinking water guidelines advise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the organism is detected, advice should be sought from the relevant health authority or drinking water regulator.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guidelines also provide recommendations on how to disinfect water supplies and control N. fowleri , using chlorine and other chemical compounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll public town water supplies across Australia are regularly tested to ensure that water is safe to drink.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Albanese government moves ahead with election pledge to cap prescription medicines to $25\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know the exact cause of the detection of the amoeba N. fowleri in these Queensland towns\u2019 water supplies. But drinking or cooking with water contaminated with this amoeba will not cause an infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny activity that allows potentially contaminated water to go up the nose should be navigated carefully for now in the affected areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nContamination of a town drinking water supply from this amoeba is very rare and is unlikely in other Australian town water supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reduce your risk in potentially infected warm, fresh waters you should keep your head above water while swimming. And don\u2019t jump or dive in. You can use a nose-clip if you want to swim with your head under water.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amoeba cannot survive in salt water, so there\u2019s no risk swimming in the ocean. Also, properly maintained swimming pools should be safe from the organism.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Health advises that the amoeba cannot survive in water that is clean, cool and adequately chlorinated.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Talks to strike a landmark global treaty on plastic pollution fell apart on Friday, leaving many frustrated and some calling it a \"missed opportunity\".\n\n\n\n\n\nNegotiators from 185 nations met in Geneva last week to try and draft the world's first legally-binding treaty to deal with the growing global issue of plastic pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite working beyond Thursday's deadline and through the night, the talks were ultimately futile and nations could not reach a consensus.\n\n\n\n\n\nA large bloc of nations including the European Union, Britain and many African and Latin American countries called for curbing plastic production and phasing out toxic chemicals used in plastics.\n\n\n\nHowever, a smaller group of oil-producing states including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia argued instead for waste management.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese countries railed against the negotiations being based on the entire life-cycle of plastic: from the petroleum-derived substance through to waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile around 100 nations sought caps on plastic production, a number of countries including the United States stood against them and argued caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.\n\n\n\nWhile a large number of nations argued for caps on plastic production others, including the US, stood against them. Source: AAP / Martial Trezzini/EPA\n\n'Missed a historic opportunity'\n\nRepresentatives of countries voiced anger and despair as the talks unravelled, but said they wanted future negotiations \u2014 despite six rounds of talks over three years now having failed to find agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have missed a historic opportunity but we have to keep going and act urgently,\" said Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n\nColombia added: \"The negotiations were consistently blocked by a small number of states who simply don't want an agreement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTuvalu, speaking for 14 Pacific small island developing states, said: \"For our islands this means that without global cooperation and state action, millions of tonnes of plastic waste will continue to be dumped in our oceans, affecting our ecosystem, food security, livelihood and culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance's ecological transition minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said she was \"disappointed\" and \"angry\" and blamed a handful of countries \"guided by short-term financial interests\" for blocking an ambitious treaty.\n\n\n\n\"Oil-producing countries and their allies have chosen to look the other way,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham Forbes, the head of Greenpeace's delegation to the talks called the collapse of negotiations a \"wake up call for the world\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The vast majority of governments want a strong agreement, yet a handful of bad actors were allowed to use process to drive such ambition into the ground. We cannot continue to do the same thing and expect a different result. The time for hesitation is over,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental NGOs also warned that without radically changing the process to better reflect the majority view, future talks will hit the same dead end.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Azoulay from the Center for International Environmental Law's David Azoulay said the talks had been an \"abject failure\" because some countries were out to \"block any attempt at advancing a viable treaty\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature said the talks exposed how consensus decision-making \"had now \"outplayed its role in international environmental negotiations\".\n\n\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nOil-producing nations argued that recycling, reuse and product design were sufficient to address the problem of global plastic pollution without resorting to production cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, experts say these are not substantial answers to the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nIngar Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), which hosted the talks, has said the world \"will not recycle our way out of the plastic pollution crisis\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile 15 per cent of plastic waste is collected for recycling, only nine per cent is actually recycled.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The tiny particles infiltrating our bodies and causing big problems for Australia\n\nThe future of the UNEP negotiations is now uncertain and while some countries have committed to resuming negotiations, others expressed that they have lost faith after repeated attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndersen also pledged to continue work. \"We did not get where we want but people want a deal,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn current trends, annual production of fossil-fuel-based plastics will nearly triple by 2060 to 1.2 billion tonnes, while waste will exceed one billion tonnes, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Lee accepted that Qantas was sorry for the illegal outsourcing, but he wasn\u2019t convinced the measure of regret was \u201csignificant\u201d and described it as \u201cthe wrong kind of sorry\u201d. He pointed to efforts within Qantas to obscure the decision-making process for the firings, the willingness of Qantas to actively appeal the court\u2019s decisions before being able to fully review them, and the decision not to have Vanessa Hudson, the former CFO, testify in court. Hudson has been CEO since Joyce stepped down in 2023. On the $90 million penalty he ordered Qantas to pay the TWU, Lee said: \u201cIt does not strike me as intuitively wrong that greater rewards might be appropriate for circumstances of greater risk.\u201d The payment of at least a large part of the penalty to the union was \u201cwarranted\u201d, he said, adding that he was \u201csatisfied that such a course will facilitate and promote the specific and general deterrence\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will send a message to Qantas and well-resourced employers that, not only will they face potentially significant penalties for the breach of the [Fair Work] Act, but those penalties will be provided to trade unions to resource those units to fulfil their statutory roles as enforcers of the Act,\u201d he said. The decision was announced at a Federal Court hearing on Monday, following a verdict in the Federal Court in December. Qantas is yet to comment on the penalty. The TWU had sought the maximum penalty of $121 million, while Qantas was seeking a fine between $40 million and $80 million. The union had asked to be the recipient of the full sum. The case marks a significant win for the TWU at a time when the conditions of wages and work are being debated in the post-COVID economy. Qantas aircraft stand on the tarmac at Sydney Airport during the COVID lockdown in 2020. Credit: Bloomberg\n\nThe penalty is in addition to the $120 million Qantas has already agreed to pay in compensation to the illegally fired workers. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a final win for both those workers and the tens of thousands of other TWU members who backed them every step of the way. \u201cThey weren\u2019t just sacked, they were told by Qantas that they were delusional for questioning it,\u201d Kaine continued. \u201cThis ruthless, self-interested and illegal calculation to kick them to the curb has rightfully merited the largest ever penalty of its kind.\n\nLoading \u201cQantas is only sorry now that it has to pay the largest penalty fine of any employer in Australian corporate history.\u201d Stephen Smith, principal of Actus Workplace Lawyers, which specialises in employment law said: \u201cThe sheer size of the penalty awarded to the TWU in this case will no doubt encourage the TWU and other unions to pursue speculative claims against employers.\u201d In the future, Smith said unions will be able to pursue much larger maximum penalties because civil penalties under the Fair Work Act have recently increased.\n\nAfter the 2020 sackings, the TWU immediately challenged the decision in court, and it was found the following year that Qantas had acted illegally \u201cin part motivated by a desire to prevent the employees taking protected industrial action in the future\u201d. Former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. Credit: Eamon Gallagher Qantas appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which unanimously dismissed it, in a win for the TWU. In December 2024, Qantas agreed with the TWU to pay $120 million in compensation to the 1820 ground staff whose contracts were terminated, including 1700 workers who lost their jobs outright, as well as 120 who were redeployed within Qantas but suffered non-economic losses.",

Seems everyone\u2019s trying to \u2018do a Centra\u2019\n\nCollingwood rookie and last year\u2019s No.1 draft pick Ash Centra might have only had three touches during her debut, but the young gun still managed to kick a goal. However, it was her pre-game actions on Thursday night that had everyone talking.\n\nCentra skilfully bounced the footy between her legs like a basketball, inspiring many others (including Hawthorn coach Sam Mitchell and Pies men\u2019s players Nick Daicos, Jack Crisp and Darcy Cameron) to try and mimic the tricky move.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s [Centra] got a cult-following,\u201d Collingwood coach Sam Wright said after their loss to Carlton.\n\n\u201cEvery time, she got the ball \u2026 you could hear the crowd. I just think it\u2019s so great for our game. I mean, the long sleeves, you see her coming from a mile away.\n\n\u201cI was really happy for her that she kicked that goal, she\u2019s going to be a serious player.\u201d\n\n2. \u2018I\u2019ll wear a helmet and a ski mask\u2019: Harris jokes after eye injury\n\nTayla Harris wasn\u2019t in the game long before suffering an eye injury but did have time to take a trademark speccy. Credit: Getty Images\n\nStar Melbourne ruck-forward Tayla Harris says she is \u201c100 per cent good to go\u201d for the rest of the season after suffering an eye injury during Saturday night\u2019s clash against the Bulldogs.\n\nAfter pulling off a trademark speccy just moments earlier, Harris copped an arm to her face in a marking contest with Bulldogs counterpart Alice Edmond.\n\n\u201cI obviously had to go to hospital to get some expert opinion, and yeah, all good from that point of view, I\u2019ll get an appointment with the specialist ASAP and just clear up anything else and make a plan moving forward,\u201d Harris said on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m feeling good, obviously thankfully avoided anything major, but not ideal to poke yourself in the eye, I don\u2019t recommend it.\u201d\n\nHarris confirmed there was damage to her eyeball and said she was taking eye drops to accelerate the healing process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I\u2019m told,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs long as I can play, I\u2019ll be wearing whatever\u2019s needed, I\u2019ll wear a helmet and a ski mask if I need to.\u201d\n\n3. Snoop Dogg might commentate AFLW, but some aren\u2019t pleased\n\nAFL chief executive Andrew Dillon told Fox Footy on Thursday night that there were plans to have grand final pre-game performer Snoop Dogg involved in AFLW.\n\n\u201cSnoop has to bring it on grand final day but what he does in the lead-up is super important as well,\u201d Dillon said.\n\n\u201cWhether that is commentating on an AFLW game or not, I\u2019m not sure. But we want to get the game in front of him and get his thoughts.\u201d\n\nSnoop Dogg has been hired by the AFL to perform at the grand final on September 27. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHowever, Respect Victoria chair Kate Fitz-Gibbon, who was instrumental in the creation of Australia\u2019s National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children, described the AFL\u2019s choice of Snoop Dogg as a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d given his \u201cpublic history of boasting about violence against women\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is unfathomable that the AFL would deem this artist [as] an appropriate choice for its flagship event,\u201d Fitz-Gibbon said.\n\n\u201cSport has enormous power to influence culture. By elevating an artist with a track record of degrading women, the AFL risks sending the message that misogyny is entertainment.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n4. Molloy makes a stunning return\n\nChloe Molloy played a starring role in her long-awaited return to the AFLW, firing Sydney to a 20-point win over Richmond.\n\nThe Swans co-captain slotted four goals on return from a knee reconstruction. She tore her anterior cruciate ligament at training in September 2024 \u2013 just one game into last season.\n\nThe 26-year-old picked up where she left off, combining well with maturing midfielder Montana Ham (18 disposals, six score involvements) in front of 4126 fans.\n\n5. Zippy by name and nature: Young Swan stuns on debut\n\nAll eyes were on Swan debutant Zippy fish during Sydney\u2019s clash against Richmond on Friday night. As the Larrakia, Wongi, Noongar and Nunga woman told The Age last year, \u201cit would be a bit awkward if I was slow\u201d.\n\nWestern Australian AFLW player, Zipporah \u201cZippy\u201d Fish. Credit: Tony McDonough\n\nFish, drafted with pick No.5 last year, lived up to her name, flaunting her blistering pace from half-back.

    "text": "It\u2019s not an empty threat. Croatia is closely monitoring Segecic, and has already poached another of Australia\u2019s rising stars, with goalkeeper Anthony Pavlesic - who, like Segecic, was born and raised in Sydney and played youth international football for Australia - electing earlier this year to represent the nation of his family\u2019s heritage. Pavlesic, 19, this week sealed a transfer from Bayern Munich to Croatian club NK Rudes, whose chairman is Josip Simunic, another born-and-bred Aussie who famously turned his back on the Socceroos. Meanwhile, Popovic\u2019s policy of refusing to \u201csell\u201d the Australian jersey to players eligible to represent other countries may have cost him another top talent in Sunderland\u2019s Nectar Triantis, the former Central Coast Mariners star who has had his switch from Australia to Greece approved by FIFA. Triantis, 22, was called up by the Socceroos in March but was not used, and his negative experience in camp contributed to his decision, according to sources close to him. The last time Popovic spoke to Australian media, he warned that the country\u2019s budding young stars had to \u201cearn\u201d their call-ups, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not about, \u2018OK, I heard some guy scored two goals and yeah, great, we\u2019ll just give them a call to the national team.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t go like that.\u201d\n\nLosing Segecic, if it were to happen, would sting even more because he is a rare talent in a part of the field where the Socceroos desperately need new impetus. In fact, it could be argued that Segecic - who finished tied with former Adelaide United striker Archie Goodwin for the A-League\u2019s golden boot last season - is the most in-form Australian attacker anywhere in the world. He has had a direct hand in all three of the goals scored by Portsmouth so far this term, his latest involvement being a spectacular strike from outside the box to claw one back in a 2-1 defeat to Norwich City. For those who watched him in the A-League, it was a familiar highlight, with Segecic possessing the sort of swagger that makes him unafraid to swing his dangerous left foot at distance if the opportunity presents itself. \u201cI feel like these days, a lot of young kids don\u2019t believe in themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more robotic ... you don\u2019t see the old-fashioned No.10 types. As a young player coming through, the hardest thing is to have confidence and believe in yourself. I feel like if you tell yourself you\u2019re going to go out there, and you\u2019re going to do it, and you\u2019ve put the hard work in, there\u2019s a good chance that it can happen. If you don\u2019t back yourself, and you don\u2019t take that shot, you\u2019re never going to score \u2026 if you do, it could be the difference in the game.\u201d\n\nThere will be an immense sense of pride in Segecic\u2019s journey from a Sydney FC perspective, given he joined the club\u2019s academy at the age of 12, but also pain. Firstly, because the Sky Blues won\u2019t be able to cash in on Segecic\u2019s rise because they lost him to Portsmouth on a free transfer, pocketing under $1 million in training compensation for him, with no sell-on clauses retained - and secondly, because his trajectory suggests that had coach Ufuk Talay started him more often last season, they might have made the A-League finals. Loading He has signed a three-year deal with Portsmouth, and their decision to hand him the coveted No.10 jersey is a sign of the high esteem held in him by manager John Mousinho, who has scoured the A-League for diamond-in-the-rough recruits. Three other Australians are also at the club: Segecic\u2019s former Sydney FC teammate Hayden Matthews, ex-Brisbane Roar striker Thomas Waddingham and Central Coast Mariners product Jacob Farrell. \u201cHe must love the A-League,\u201d Segecic said. \u201cFrom the minute I spoke to him, I just felt like that\u2019s a manager I\u2019d love to play under. He gave me goosebumps. It\u2019s someone that you\u2019d love to fight for and do well for. He said he saw me playing in that No.10 role, and like you saw in the A-League, that\u2019s where I can cause the most damage. As soon as he said that, that was me sold.\u201d",

    "text": "Daily weekday trips at North Sydney station have more than halved to 12,200, while patronage at St Leonards has fallen by a third, and by more than a tenth at Wynyard and Town Hall. Sydney transport expert Mathew Hounsell said the metro line had proven to be \u201cabsolutely world beating\u201d in how it had encouraged people to use it consistently. \u201cIt helped bring the city back from the edge after COVID because you now have the whole northwest and north shore able to get into the city quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should serve as an example for the whole country that if you build frequent, reliable transport, people will use it.\u201d\n\nCrows Nest resident Charlie Smith said the metro was \u201clife-changing\u201d for his commute between work, home and university. \u201cIt\u2019s just so convenient to get everywhere, and the stations are so pretty. It\u2019s so fast and comes every four minutes \u2013 it\u2019s 10 minutes into the city, 10 minutes to Macquarie Uni where I study, and it\u2019s just perfect,\u201d he said. Martin Place metro station is consistently surpassing patronage forecasts. Credit: Sam Mooy Commuters will have to wait until at least April next year for the M1\u2019s final stage between Sydenham and Bankstown to open, which has been blamed on the complexity of converting the old T3 heavy rail line to metro train standards and disruptions from industrial action. Regan said a higher frequency of services than on the former T3 rail line, together with much faster journeys between Sydenham and the CBD and north shore, was forecast to boost patronage on the M1 line.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s quite asymmetrical. The patronage in the morning peaks is very heavily from the north, and less coming up from Sydenham,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cBut once the Bankstown line is opened, it will be much more balanced because you\u2019ll have an extra 10 stations picking up people from the south.\u201d Regan said it was expected to lead to similar passenger loads on the M1 line to and from the south-west to what was already experienced on services between the northwest and the CBD. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a very balanced load in both directions,\u201d he said. While Martin Place and Gadigal have surpassed expectations, Waterloo and Crows Nest stations continue to lag patronage forecasts.\n\nAt Waterloo, planned development around the station has been slower than originally forecast. \u201cIn COVID, everyone got a bit nervous about commercial so they switched it to [residential],\u201d Regan said. \u201cNow they\u2019re looking at the timing of it. Some of the development directly on our site has taken longer.\u201d Loading Similarly, at Crows Nest, it has taken time for some developments along the Pacific Highway to be completed. \u201cYou can really see it starting to accelerate now, and the housing developments directly above the station are now being marketed,\u201d Regan said. Trains run every four minutes in both directions on the M1 line during weekday peaks between about 7am and 10am, and from 3pm to 7pm. They operate every five minutes from 10am to 3pm, and every 10 minutes at other times. Regan said a boost to train frequencies before 7am on weekdays was \u201cdefinitely an option\u201d if patronage kept growing, and was possible with the existing 45-strong fleet.",

Source: Pulse Tasmania\n\nMore than $40,000 in fines have been handed down in just the space of a week in one Aussie state as new hi-tech road cameras were switched to enforcement mode at the start of this month.\n\nAfter more than two years of construction, the most expensive transport infrastructure project in Tasmania's history opened to commuters in June. At 1.2-kilometres, the Bridgewater Bridge is built across the River Derwent in Hobart and was fitted with speeding cameras which are now handing out serious fines.\n\nSince the grace period ended at the start of August, 246 motorists have been issued a speeding fine relating to the very first week of enforcement, the Department of State Growth confirmed to Yahoo News on Monday.\n\nProvided that all fines are eventually paid, that's $41,410 of revenue just from the period of August 1 to August 7.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDespite the tidy sum, authorities said the first week of enforcement still saw a significant decline in speeding compared to the trial period conducted in the previous weeks.\n\n\"We are pleased to report an approximate 70 per cent reduction in speeding incidents detected on the new Bridgewater Bridge since the speed cameras went live compared to the testing period,\" a department spokesperson told Yahoo.\n\nPlenty of Hobart locals. turned out to walk to bridge on the day it opened to the public in June.
