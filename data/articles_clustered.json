    "text": "Netflix has struck a deal with Warner Bros Discovery to buy the legacy Hollywood giant's studio and streaming business for $US72 billion ($108 billion).\n\nThe acquisition, announced overnight, would bring two of the industry's biggest players in film and TV under one roof. Beyond its namesake television and motion picture division, Warner owns HBO Max and DC Studios. And Netflix has risen to dominance as a household name ubiquitous to on-demand content, while building its own production arm to release popular titles like Stranger Things and Squid Game .\n\nThe cash and stock deal is valued at $US27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of approximately $US82.7 billion ($124.55 billion). The transaction is expected to close after Warner separates its Discovery Global cable operations into a new publicly-traded company in the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThis image released by Warner Bros Pictures shows Leonardo DiCaprio in a scene from One Battle After Another. (AP)\n\nShares of Warner Bros rose nearly 3 per cent in premarket trading while shares of Netflix and Paramount fell more than 2 per cent.\n\nGaining Warner's legacy studios would mark a notable shift for Netflix's current movie theatre footprint. Under the proposed acquisition Netflix has promised to continue theatrical releases for Warner's studio films \u2014 honouring Warner's contractual agreements for movie releases.\n\nNetflix has kept most of its original content within its core online platform. But there have been a few exceptions, such as limited theatre screenings of a KPop Demon Hunters sing-a-long and its coming Stranger Things series finale.\n\nAs recently as October \u2014 when Warner signalled that it was open to a potential sale of its business \u2014 Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated on an earnings call that the company had been \"very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks\" and that there was \"no change there\".\n\n\"We believe that we can be and we will be choosy,\" Sarandos said at the time, without fully ruling out a potential bid for Warner.\n\nREAD MORE: Tributes to woman killed by her own dog in South Australian home \ufeff\n\nNetflix has struck a deal with Warner Bros Discovery to buy the legacy Hollywood giant's studio and streaming business for $US72 billion ($108 billion). (AP)\n\nFriday's announcement arrives after a monthslong bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery. Rumours of interest from Netflix, as well as NBC owner Comcast, started bubbling up in the northern hemisphere autumn. But Skydance-owned Paramount, which completed its own $US8 billion merger in August, had also reportedly made several all-cash offers backed heavily by CEO David Ellison's family.",

(Getty)\n\n\"Australia's health system is valued for its mix of public and private healthcare, but both parts of the system are under increasing pressure,\" McMullen said.\n\n\"Public hospitals are struggling with a severe logjam crisis, which is pushing more patients towards the private sector.\n\n\"However, runaway insurance premiums, low value offerings and shady tactics like product phoenixing leave customers facing tough choices about the level of cover they can afford.\"\n\nCost of living pressures are seeing people drop gold-tier policies. (Nine)\n\nAustralians are paying more for private health insurance and getting less for their money in return, a new report from the country's top doctors' advocacy group says. (Getty)\n\nThe report card showed that every year since 2008, the growth of private health insurance premiums has outstripped inflation, health sector inflation, average weekly earnings and the indexation of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).\n\nBetween 2008 and 2024, premiums climbed more than 100 per cent, while MBS indexation \u2013 which was frozen for several years from 2013 \u2013 increased by less than 20 per cent.\n\nThe report card also shows that over the six years to June 2025, insurers increased benefits paid for in-hospital medical treatment by only 18.1 per cent, while sector profits grew by nearly 50 per cent over the same period.\n\nREAD MORE: Manhunt for prisoner who escaped from police at hospital \ufeff\n\nIn 2024-2025, insurers returned 84.2 per cent of premiums to consumers as benefits, below the 2019 level of 88 per cent.\n\nThe AMA is calling on the federal government to mandate a 90 per cent return minimum for insurers.\n\n\"Of course, private health insurers must make a surplus to be sustainable, but it is clear they are holding out on Australians while recording significant profits each year,\" McMullen said.\n\nThe AMA is calling for major reform. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"These insurers have ample capacity to increase the benefits paid to patients.\"\n\nThe report also found gold-tier policies are in decline as consumers face rising premiums and cost-of-living pressures.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the number of gold-tier policies have dropped by 360,000, despite the overall number of policies growing.\n\n\"These trends show that private health insurance is becoming less affordable for many Australians \u2013 and we are already seeing the drastic effects of this, with at least 14 private maternity units closing over the past five years,\" McMullen said.\n\n\"The need for a Private Health System Authority to better regulate the sector and drive long-term reform has never been more crucial. There are too many bodies involved in the regulation of private health \u2013 a single, independent authority would provide a unified and coherent approach.\"",

(ABC Illawarra: Justin Huntsdale)\n\nIt marks the end of a colourful history for one of Wollongong's most iconic and controversial establishments.\n\nGeorge Harrison and his wife Vania began operating the restaurant after signing a lease with the council in 1986 through their company Emibarb Pty Ltd.\n\nIt was a move criticised at the time by parts of the community who opposed Crown land, which is owned by the NSW government, being used for a large commercial restaurant.\n\nThe debate intensified when Mr Harrison became a prominent campaigner for the Labor Party, and then the lord mayor of Wollongong in 1999.\n\nFormer Wollongong ALP lord mayor George Harrison outside his family restaurant. (Supplied: Wollongong City Libraries and the Illawarra Historical Society)\n\nLabor Party connection\n\nOver the years the Lagoon became a favourite of Wollongong's political class.\n\nMr Harrison operated the restaurant while serving as the Labor lord mayor.\n\nThen in January 2001, while he was still lord mayor, a mysterious fire destroyed much of the restaurant and it had to be rebuilt.\n\nIn 2002 Mr Harrison suffered a loss in a long running legal battle with former business partner Delcie Shipp and declared himself bankrupt.\n\nHe was expelled from the Labor Party and was forced to resign as lord mayor, saying he resigned to protect his family.\n\n\"I feel a lot of pressure has been placed upon my family as a result of the personal litigation brought against me by a former business partner,\" he said at the time.\n\nA new 20-year-lease was signed with Wollongong Council in March 2003.\n\nEven after Mr Harrison's resignation the Lagoon remained a popular destination for Labor fundraising events.\n\nAfter one such event in 2005 the then-state MP for Wollongong, Noreen Hay, had to pay back money to Wollongong Council after the council picked up the tab for Labor councillors attending one of her fundraising events.\n\nNoreen Hay was the state member for Wollongong from 2003 to 2016. (ABC Illawarra)\n\n\"They hadn't paid, so due to the events that have arisen since the dinner I decided to cover the costs of those councillors myself,\" Ms Hay said at the time.\n\nMr Harrison died in 2020 from cancer, with the restaurant under the management of his son Andrew Harrison.\n\nRecent woes\n\nThe Lagoon also faced challenges in its later years.\n\nIn August 2023 a group of Illawarra businessmen were fined $2 million for the illegal overfishing of eastern rock lobsters and selling them without the required tags to establishments including the Lagoon.\n\nAs part of the case, head chef Emanuel Efstathiadis was fined $20,000 and handed a suspended jail sentence for acting as the conduit between the fishing company and the restaurant.\n\nIn May the restaurant was slapped with two $880 fines for failing to store food safely and for failing to maintain the required standard of cleanliness, after earlier warnings.\n\nDespite these recent difficulties, Andrew Harrison told ABC Illawarra in August he was very sad to see it coming to an end after working there since his childhood.\n\n\"Because I [started] at such a young age working throughout my childhood it became a part of me and it was in my blood,\" he said.\n\n\"Basically we have had two 20 year leases, so I have always known 2026 was going to be probably the last hurrah. So it's nothing new to me.\n\n\"It doesn't make it easier though because it's still 40 years of my life.\"\n\nAndrew Harrison worked in Lagoon Restaurant from a very young age. (Supplied: Lagoon Restaurant)\n\nQuestions about the lease\n\nWollongong Council's lease with the Lagoon was also scrutinised.\n\nThe council register revealed the lease with Emibarb Pty Ltd for Stuart Park Kiosk Lagoon from July 11, 2006, to July 10, 2026, was for $1 million.\n\nCommunity group Neighbourhood Forum 5 raised concerns at the time when the 1,400 square metre area of the lease was expanded to include an additional 660 square metres.\n\nAndrew Harrison said to the best of his knowledge that figure was just a \"starting point\".\n\n\"Since then the rent has increased in line with the CPI and I can confirm that the current rent being paid today is approximately double the figure shown on the register,\" he said.\n\nStuart Park in Wollongong with Lagoon Restaurant in the foreground. (ABC Illawarra: Justin Huntsdale)\n\nMr Harrison said the deal took into account upwards of $3 million invested by the Harrison family to reconstruct the venue after the fire.\n\nThe ABC sought to confirm the figures with Wollongong City Council but was told they were commercial-in-confidence.\n\nMr Harrison also said \"while the lease may look favourable on paper\" it was extremely challenging to rebuild over the course of almost three years.\n\n\"It took an enormous amount of work, investment, and personal sacrifice to rebuild and reopen,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe the Lagoon has added tremendous value to the site over the past four decades.\n\n\"When the restaurant burnt down and the site sat empty, the area became derelict, attracted antisocial behaviour, and wasn't a place families felt comfortable visiting.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nNeighbourhood Forum 5 is seeking assurances the community will be fairly compensated in the new lease and is asking for community oversight.\n\n\"We think it's time for the community to have a bit of input into what they are asking for in the lease,\" co-convenor John Riggall said.\n\n\"We're asking if possible to have some input into the scope of the tender documentation.\n\n\"We want to make sure the council gets fair value for money.\"\n\nA Wollongong City Council spokesperson told the ABC long-term leases provided security of tenure for both tenant and customer, and it is required \"to undertake a competitive tender process\".\n\nTwo companies that have submitted bids are the the inner Sydney restaurant and bar Grounds of Alexandria, which reportedly changed hands in 2023 for $186 million, and Top Pub Mittagong, currently known as the Mittagong Hotel.\n\nA spokesman for Wollongong Council said he was not aware of when the successful tenderer for the site would be announced.\n\nRegardless of who wins the new lease, the restaurant will occupy a key place in the city's culinary and political history.",

    "text": "The prime minister's office approved last-minute flight changes for Communications Minister Anika Wells and two staffers that cost taxpayers almost $100,000, Anthony Albanese has confirmed amid an ongoing expenses furore.\n\nMs Wells has been under fire since it emerged during Senate estimates she had spent $94,827 on three business-class flights to New York, where she delivered a speech on the incoming social media ban on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nShe was initially scheduled to travel with the prime minister for the September meeting, but delayed her departure when news of the Optus Triple Zero (000) outage broke.\n\nThe minister has repeatedly defended her spending, insisting it falls within the guidelines, as the Coalition called for an independent review of her expenses.\n\nAnika Wells has come under fire for the cost of flights she took to New York in September. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nMr Albanese backed her in on Sunday, telling ABC's Insiders Ms Wells was \"doing her job as the communications minister who is in charge of this world-leading legislation\".\n\nHe also confirmed that he spoke to Ms Wells about the decision for her to delay her departure and that his office signed off on the new flights.\n\n\"We make decisions as a government,\" he said.\n\n\"We spoke in the morning, and the minister travelled. It was a very significant event for Australia.\"\n\nOatmeal back on the menu as budget pressures grow It's been a long time coming, but there's a growing sense that budget politics might soon become more spicy.\n\nSince the New York flight revelation, the Brisbane-based minister has also been forced to explain a trip to Adelaide where she attended a friend's birthday party, a ski trip with her family to Thredbo and the cost of meals during the Paris Olympics.\n\nIn all cases, Ms Wells insists she was working and therefore it was within parliamentary guidelines to charge the expenses to the taxpayer.\n\n\"I had to be in two places at once. It was a really tricky situation,\" she told Sky News on Sunday, about the New York flights.\n\n\"I genuinely chose the option where I thought I could discharge my duties in both areas.\"\n\nThe uproar has distracted from Ms Wells's efforts to spruik the government's much-anticipated social media ban for under 16s, which is due to come into force on Wednesday.\n\nThredbo trip under the spotlight\n\nIn the case of the Thredbo trip, Ms Wells said she was invited by Paralympics Australia and she made use of a \"family reunion\" entitlement available to parliamentarians.\n\nNine newspapers on Sunday reported the minister had charged taxpayers almost $3,000 for travel allowances and flights for her family to join her at the snow.\n\nThe Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority shows Ms Wells claimed $844 for two nights' accommodation at Thredbo on June 20 and 21 and another $318 for a one-night stay in Canberra on June 22, listed as \"official\" duties and \"parliamentary\" duties.\n\nHer partner and children went skiing over the weekend, she said, while she attended the Adaptive Festival for Paralympics Australia, held a press conference and visited the National Training Centre.\n\nShe then attended official meetings in Canberra on Monday.\n\n\"Every parliamentarian has family reunion entitlement, which I follow. I followed the guidelines on this occasion. I followed the guidelines on all of the occasions. I will continue to do that,\" she told Sky News.\n\n\"Entitlements should be scrutinised, I'm happy for mine to be scrutinised, I'm happy for mine to continue to be scrutinised, but at the end of the day, I don't write these rules.\"\n\nThe family reunion entitlement allows MPs travelling within Australia to bring along their spouse, dependent children or other designated people at the government's expense, for the purpose of facilitating \"family life\", according to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese defended Anika Wells in an interview on Insiders. (ABC News)\n\nMr Albanese said the trip was \"within entitlements\" as Ms Wells was working during it in her capacity as sports minister.\n\nHe did not say, when asked, whether he would have done the same thing.\n\n\"There are rules there, and I'm not going to go through each and every one,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\nSimilar questions were asked of now-Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke almost a decade ago, after he charged taxpayers more than $12,000 for a four-day trip with his family to Uluru, including more than $8,000 for business-class flights.\n\nAt the time, Mr Burke insisted it was within guidelines but eventually conceded the trip was \"beyond community expectations\".\n\nLiberal frontbencher James Paterson called on Ms Wells to refer all her travel expenses to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority for review.\n\n\"Ministers of the Crown are paid very well, hundreds of thousands of dollars. If she wants to take her family on a ski holiday, she can pay for it herself,\" he told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\"Otherwise, she's completely out of touch with thousands of Australians right around the country struggling to make ends meet.\"\n\nSenator Paterson said the Coalition would be \"happy\" to take a look at whether the expenses guidelines were too broad, but added that he did not think the rules were the issue.\n\n\"Rules are not a substitute for judgement. Just because something can be done, doesn't mean it should be done,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this is about Anika Wells, and not about the rules.\"\n\nA government spokesperson said Ms Wells's travel \"was in accordance with the guidelines\".",

    "text": "Farmers are concerned Australia's new environmental laws will restrict their ability to manage their land responsibly.\n\nFollowing a deal between Labor and the Greens last week, the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation laws have introduced tightened controls for land clearing and larger fines for breaches.\n\nIn Queensland, native trees, including brigalow, mulga, boree, gidgee and eucalypt, are periodically cleared on properties to manage thick regrowth.\n\nJosh Phelps runs cattle on properties near Tambo, Brigalow and Bauhinia, in the heart of Queensland's scrub country.\n\n\"To put a blanket-type ruling over a nation, I just find it hard to grapple with,\" he said.\n\nThe Brigalow Belt runs from northern to Central Queensland and is known for its wide band of acacia-wooded grassland. (ABC Rural: Megan Hughes)\n\nThe Central Queensland producer said clearing was an essential part of land management, provided it was done in a \"sustainable\" way.\n\n\"A lot of that mulga land is actually rotated at 10, 15, 20-year intervals \u2014 not just to keep stock alive and healthy through dry times, but also as part of maintaining vegetation on the ground,\" Mr Phelps said.\n\nThe same laws for all sectors\n\nFederal Environment Minister and Queensland Senator Murray Watt faced \"furious\" backlash from sections of Australia's agricultural community after the laws passed parliament last week.\n\nThe laws do not automatically prevent clearing, but federal approval would be needed when clearing could damage nationally protected \"environmental matters\".\n\n\"If that clearing will have a significant impact on, for example, threatened species, then they would need to seek federal environmental approval to do that in the same way that other industries do,\" Senator Watt said.\n\nProducers say clearing is part of regular land maintenance. (ABC Rural: Marty McCarthy)\n\nHe also clarified that land clearing within 50 metres of rivers, creeks and wetlands within the Greater Barrier Reef catchment would need federal approval.\n\nSenator Watt has repeatedly stated that the changes to Australia's environmental laws will bring agricultural approvals in line with other sectors.\n\n\"All this means is that producers need to comply with the same environmental standards and laws that every other industry needs to meet, like mining, housing development, renewable energy and other industries,\" he said.\n\nThe clearing laws don't take into consideration the realities of managing land, Josh Phelps says. (ABC Rural: Maddelin McCosker)\n\nBut Mr Phelps said blanket rules were the fundamental problem with the changes.\n\n\"I think the forgotten element here is there's people involved in this,\" Mr Phelps said.\n\n\"We're not asking to knock down a heap of country, we're just asking to let us do what we do well.\"\n\nAn 'unaffordable' approvals process\n\nThis year, data from Queensland's Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) found Queensland livestock producers have cleared fewer trees for pasture, although environmentalists say the new federal laws do n 'o go far enough.\n\nQueensland Primary Industries Minister Tony Perrett said the changes added unnecessary red tape, created economic uncertainty and could render state-approved farming practices illegal.\n\n\"It's bringing farmers into line with multi-billion dollar foreign companies that propose mining projects here in the state,\" he said.\n\n\"This impact on mum-and-dad farmers in this state, to go through the regulatory process that's now required, will drive these people insane.\n\n\"This is never an easy process. It'll be unaffordable.\"",

    "text": "As I sit down to write up this interview with passionate Melbourne-based filmmaker Sue Thomson about her must-see documentary Careless, which examines the bipartisan mess that's been made of aged residential care via privatisation, a text from her pops up.\n\nThe mighty Margaret, Thomson's mother, whose resistance to going into care is the cornerstone of the film, died over the weekend. I've been given permission to mention this, and I think Margaret's worth saluting.\n\n\"She was funny and outrageous, smoked cigarettes, sewed all my clothes and my dolls', worked full-time as a nurse and was incredible,\" Thomson says.\n\n\"But over the years, I saw another side of her. She was full of grief and pain, residual trauma from her upbringing.\"\n\nFast Facts about Careless What: A funny, frank and fearless family-focused documentary about the state of aged care in Australia Directed by: Sue Thomson Starring: Margaret Thomson, Sue Thomson, Lola Nankervis When: In cinemas December 4 Likely to make you feel: Like the major party politicians have a lot to answer for\n\nLike many older Australians, some doors were best left closed, in Margaret's mind.\n\n\"We were never allowed to talk about her losing her mother at 16 in a very tragic way,\" Thomson says.\n\n\"Her father had a stroke. When my mum and dad divorced, we had family members she never saw again. My mum's armour went up big time, and she and I clashed for years.\"\n\nThomson and Margaret butt heads in the film but there's never any doubt of their deep bond of love and respect. Lola, Thomson's daughter with partner Brian Nankervis (ABC Melbourne host and RocKwiz co-host) eases their sparring.\n\n\"I have three children working in the arts, with Lola particularly interested in making her own documentaries,\" Thomson says. \"So I asked her if she would be interested in working on Careless. If I hadn't had Lola, my mother would have hardly been in the film.\"\n\nSue Thomson's mother Margaret (pictured) was the inspiration behind Careless. (Supplied: Ben Bryan)\n\nCareless features a gorgeous cast of older Australians faced with leaving their beloved homes, including immigrant Italian couple Luciana and Mario and First Nations Elder Professor Linda Payi Ford (Rak Mak Mak Marranunggu) who notes remote communities often have no care home provision, let alone a reliable phone or internet connection.\n\nLola bridged the gap.\n\n\"She did that with all the subjects, who saw her as their grandchild and were much more at ease.\"\n\nOmnishambles\n\nIntergenerational care, and how we've lost sight of that, is at the heart of Careless, which debuted at this year's Melbourne International Film Festival.\n\n\"Capitalism plays a big part, sadly,\" Thomson says. \"In Western society, it became all about home ownership, so you work longer hours and you're not available to care.\"\n\nThe film, co-written and produced by Thomson's regular collaborator, Adam Farrington-Williams, marks the finale of an unofficial trilogy.\n\nThe Coming Back Out Ball Movie explores aging as an LGBTQIA+ person, sometimes having to go back in the closet in care homes.\n\n\"What was incredible was their resilience and positivity, despite what they suffered through,\" Thomson says.\n\nUnder Cover investigates the shocking statistic that women over 50 are the fastest-growing cohort experiencing homelessness in Australia.\n\n\"There are women over 50 living in their cars,\" Thomson says.\n\n\"Loneliness is probably a bit of a through line.\"\n\nProfessor Linda Payi Ford is a senior research fellow at Charles Darwin University, with her research focusing on Indigenous issues. (Supplied: Ben Bryan)\n\nCareless opens with a montage of prime ministerial pratfalls, playing on the word 'careless', then goes on to unpick not just their clumsy footwork, but also how they have let older Australians down.\n\nBob Hawke and Paul Keating made moves towards business, but it was John Howard who turbocharged the privatisation shift. The successive Labor governments of Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Anthony Albanese have done little to course-correct.\n\n\"In 1997, the government very clearly saw it as a way of making lots of money, without thinking clearly about the long-term effects of monetising aging,\" Thomson says.\n\n\"They all talk a lot, we had a royal commission, and very little has changed.\"\n\nEven the food that residents are served is heinous, as ABC TV's Maggie Beer's Big Mission underlined.\n\n\" You're paying thousands of dollars for your parents to be fed slop. \"\n\nNavigating a labyrinth\n\nTechnology can be confounding for older Australians, too, Thomson says.\n\n\"My dad was an intellectual and an academic, and my mum was a nurse, and they were so bloody stoic, they'll be fine,\" she ponders.\n\nBut they're not.\n\n\"They'll say, 'My computer's really bad, it's not working'. But they're not using it properly. Or they've got arthritis in their fingers.\"\n\nCareless attempts to get to the bottom of Australia's failing aged care system. (Supplied: Ben Bryan)\n\nGovernment website My Aged Care is labyrinthine and difficult to navigate for even the most tech-savvy amongst us. Try phoning instead, and the wait time is gargantuan; hold music plays havoc with hearing aids, then the line drops out, so you start again.\n\n\"It's brutal,\" Thomson says.\n\n\"They'd ask mum to type in a number, and she doesn't even know where to find that. So children take over the role of dealing with the enormous amount of technology.\"\n\nChildren at the younger end of the scale also feature in Careless. A Greek chorus of kids narrates it, with a hint of ABC TV's Old People's Home For 4 Year Olds.\n\n\"One of them is trying to do a fundraiser at her school for connecting older people with younger people,\" Thomson says.\n\n\"We need to close the generational gap. Older people shouldn't be locked away by themselves. They have something to offer.\"\n\nWhile Margaret had her daughter Sue as support, many Australians in aged care are without relatives. (Supplied: Ben Bryan)\n\nMany of us have no kids to rely on.\n\n\"If my mum didn't have me, she'd be f**ked,\" Thomson says. \"If you don't have children and you're growing old in Australia, Jesus Christ, I feel for you.\"\n\nPointing to solutions\n\nThomson points to Scandinavian countries with a better model and hopes we can catch up.\n\n\"With empathy, we can affect change in the smallest possible way,\" she says.\n\n\"Governments should take more control, paying for wonderful, beautiful, diverse, inclusive communities where people can age in place, supported.\n\n\"But at the moment, that ain't going to happen.\"\n\nNovember films you need to see November saw the return of two beloved franchises; magic-filled Now You See Me and action classic Predator - but can either live up to their predecessors?\n\nCareless is a cry for change, and a fitting tribute to Margaret Thomson.\n\n\"Mum is quite representative of women that age who have done it tough, who find the humour in it,\" Thomson says.\n\n\"It was really important that this film was angry at the system, but I wanted to show that they're not just maudlin, bemoaning their lives.\n\n\"They're out there doing great things, trying to make the best of it, and often they're hilarious.\"\n\nCareless releases in Australian cinemas on December 4",

(ABC News: Hayden Smith)\n\nBy transitioning to a company limited by guarantee, QVMAG would be overseen by an independent board and officially recognised as a charity, unlocking the ability to access myriad other revenue streams.\n\nThe City of Launceston would retain ownership of the buildings and their vast collection.\n\n\"This ambitious Future Directions Plan aims to set the institution on a pathway to a sustainable and secure future,\" said then-Launceston mayor Albert van Zetten in June 2022.\n\n\" The Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery is one of Launceston's most treasured and important cultural institutions. \"\n\nBut now, more than three years later, supporters of QVMAG \u2014 including one of Australia's most acclaimed painters \u2014 say the \"transition of governance\" plan has stalled.\n\nConcern after director departs\n\nA cause for concern among stakeholders is the resignation of QVMAG's general manager, Shane Fitzgerald, who was working towards developing and implementing the Futures Plan.\n\nThe born and raised Tasmanian has worked in museum leadership roles across Australia and was working at QVMAG on the Futures Plan for more than three years.\n\nShane Fitzgerald was the main architect of the QVMAG Futures Plan. (City of Launceston Facebook )\n\nThe president of QVMAG Friends, Vicki Dewsbury, said Mr Fitzgerald was \"hired with the remit to find and implement a solution\" to the financial burden on ratepayers.\n\n\"His deep-dive research and consultation with staff and stakeholders was comprehensive and his findings compelling,\" Ms Dewsbury said.\n\n\" The Futures Plan outlined the options for how QVMAG might reduce its reliance on the City of Launceston. \"\n\nBut Mr Fitzgerald abruptly left his role at QVMAG earlier this year.\n\nIn a July 4 email to council staff \u2014 seen by the ABC \u2014 City of Launceston chief executive Sam Johnson said Mr Fitzgerald had stepped down \"to pursue new opportunities\".\n\nMr Fitzgerald has been contacted for comment.\n\nIn the latest QVMAG annual report, chair of the council-appointed Museum Governance and Advisory Board James Riggall paid tribute to Mr Fitzgerald's leadership and \"understanding of the role of galleries and museums in society\".\n\nArtist unhappy QVMAG progress 'has now been halted'\n\nEarlier this year, QVMAG hosted a highly successful exhibition featuring the life's work of Tasmanian artist Michael McWilliams.\n\nThe acclaimed painter said he was fully on board with the \"bold and powerful\" Futures Plan, but was concerned by the lack of recent progress towards key benchmarks.\n\nContemporary Tasmanian artist Michael McWilliams is a big supporter of the Futures Plan. (ABC News: Sarah Abbott)\n\nUnder the Futures Plan timeline, QVMAG was supposed to be registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission by November this year.\n\nA new skills-based board was earmarked to be established next month.\n\nNeither of those things have happened.\n\n\"QVMAG would have become a major player in the cultural sector and been able to access funding opportunities that are currently beyond its scope,\" McWilliams said.\n\n\" It is really disappointing to see the process has now been halted. \"\n\nMcWilliams, who won the inaugural Glover Prize in 2004, said the Futures Plan was \"not pie in the sky\" but based on substantial research.\n\nCouncil investigating path forward\n\nLaunceston Council chief executive Sam Johnson said the council was still committed to the Futures Plan and \"currently progressing most of the actions set out\".\n\n\"The decision to move to a company limited by guarantee in 2022 appears to have been made without a sufficient understanding of the legal and financial implications or timing of the transition,\" he said.\n\n\" This crucial investigative work is now being undertaken so we can properly progress all identified actions. \"\n\nSam Johnson, chief executive officer of Launceston City Council, says they are still progressing the Futures Plan. (Supplied: City of Launceston)\n\nTwo of the plan's cornerstones were the creation of an independent board and QVMAG's registration as a charity.\n\nBut the status of these projects remains unclear.\n\n\"The Museum Governance Advisory Board is active and meets regularly \u2014 an independent board is not required while the institution is owned and operated by the City of Launceston,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\n\"Local government is not eligible to apply for charitable status.\"\n\nHe said the recruitment process was underway for Mr Fitzgerald's successor following his resignation in July.",

    "text": "Michael Neser feared his Test cricket career was over when a frustrating hamstring injury struck him down at the worst possible time last summer.\n\nA year later, the affable bowling all-rounder is \"strong again\" and on the cusp of helping Australia to a 2-0 Ashes series lead.\n\nNeser, 35, went some way to justifying his shock selection ahead of Nathan Lyon in the second Ashes Test with two big wickets \u2014 both caught-and-bowled \u2014 under lights on day three at the Gabba.\n\nAfter England flew to 0-45 at the dinner break, Neser (2-27) stretched high to catch Ollie Pope (26) from his own bowling before giving Zak Crawley (44) the same treatment.\n\nCrawley played low into Neser's hands amid a collapse of 6-80 that looks to have cruelled England's hopes of levelling the series in Brisbane.\n\nMichael Neser snaring England number three Ollie Pope and opener Zak Crawley (right). (AP: Tertius Pickard)\n\nNeser had dropped Ben Duckett (15) on six earlier in the night so was pleased to have struck back with some valuable scalps in the top order.\n\n\"That first one Duckett hit was a bit harder, he hit that very hard. Those are 50-50s but the other two were pretty regulation. Fortunately enough, I caught them,\" Neser said.\n\nEngland (6-134) went to stumps 43 runs behind Australia, who set a big first-innings total of 511 and appear likely to seal a second win from as many Tests this series.\n\nThis week's home Test felt a world away for Neser last summer after the Queenslander suffered a long-term hamstring injury playing for Australia A in early November.\n\nLoading...\n\nNeser, who had played the second of his two Test matches in 2022, had been in the mix to replace injured Cam Green for the hotly-anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\n\nInstead, he watched as Mitch Marsh and Beau Webster earned the nod as all-rounders in the famous series win, all the while questioning his own Test future.\n\n\"To be honest, after the last season, when I thought I was bowling superbly and I had my chance and I did my hammy really badly, I thought, 'Bugger, that could've been my chance,'\" Neser said.\n\nHe needed two months to recover from his injury and eventually returned to the pitch for the end of the BBL and Sheffield Shield seasons.\n\nA mainstay of extended Test squads, he skipped out on a possible county cricket stint over the Australian winter to ensure he would be fit if called upon for the Ashes.\n\n\"A big pre-season did me wonders and I feel strong again. I feel like my hammy is back to the way it was,\" Neser said.\n\nThis week marked an end to Neser's three-year wait for a third chance in the Test team, with the quick called into an all-pace attack for depleted Australia at the Gabba.\n\n\"I always dream about playing for Australia. It's something that I live and breathe, cricket. To be given another chance, I'm very honoured,\" he said.\n\nNeser holds the odd distinction among world cricketers of playing all of his first three Test matches in day-night fixtures.\n\nHe was called in for a last-minute debut in the 2021/22 Ashes series before adding a second cap against West Indies in 2022 and then replacing Lyon in Brisbane.\n\nIn a perfect world, Neser would love a crack at red-ball Test cricket, but that may not come this summer with Pat Cummins likely to recover from a back injury for the third Test.\n\n\"I'm very fortunate and privileged that I've been given the chance with the pink-ball Tests,\" he said.\n\n\"But obviously it's a dream to play more Tests and red-ball, pink-ball, I love it all.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "One of Tasmania's two breast cancer screening buses continued operating for 14 months after it was officially declared unroadworthy, until two staff received electric shocks, forcing its withdrawal.\n\nThe public was told that the bus, dubbed 'Luna', sustained water damage that caused technical issues, leading to the cancellation of all future mobile appointments around the south and east coast until further notice.\n\nShould you skip your mammogram? Is the radiation safe? Here's how they work and who should have them We break down everything to do with mammograms and with the help of these experts, bust some myths about them.\n\nDocuments obtained under a Right to Information request reveal in April, the bus \"was affected by water leaks, causing water damage and electrical failures and a subsequent safety event with two staff experiencing minor electric shocks\", leading to the bus being immediately pulled from service and repairs later being quoted at $42,000.\n\nThe department was also told \"there will still be a risk that the vehicle's cladding could detach during transport, creating a further safety hazard,\" leading it to conclude \"continuing to use and maintain (mobile screening unit) Luna is unlikely to be the safest and most cost-effective option\".\n\nThe Breastscreen Tasmania bus was declared unroadworthy, so it was delivered to locations on a flatbed truck. (Supplied: Kristie Johnston)\n\nAnother document shows the department acknowledging that without a replacement for Luna, which screens about 5,500 women for breast cancer every year, \"there is potential for an additional 30 to 50 delayed cancer diagnoses per annum\" for women who do not access screening elsewhere.\n\nWhile the department could not provide the latest figures when asked, a missed locations document shows that as of August 14, only 39 per cent of women whose appointments were cancelled in April had been rebooked.\n\nThe department did say it was \"working hard to ensure affected clients are booked for a screening as soon as possible\".\n\nThe department acknowledged \"any reduction in screening rates increases the risk of women being diagnosed with breast cancer at later stages, when the cancer is more difficult and expensive to treat \u2026 which has a subsequent significant negative impact on these women, their families and communities, and the Tasmanian health system\".\n\nLong list of faults\n\nA mechanical inspection invoice from December 2022 shows the department had been aware of serious operational faults with Luna for years, well before it was officially declared unroadworthy.\n\nWomen on 'slightly unhinged' cancer support mission When Carol Smith was diagnosed with breast cancer, she relied on support from strangers on the internet. Now, she's making sure other WA women don't have to struggle alone.\n\nAn invoice contained an extensive list of significant defects with the bus, including coolant leaks and radiator problems, a faulty brake system, worn drive belts, a rusted exhaust system, a chassis at risk of cracking, oil leaks from the transmission, and inoperable wiper washers.\n\nThe invoice also revealed that Luna had no documented history of servicing, oil changes, or wheel bearing maintenance.\n\nInternal emails exchanged between department employees in February 2024 state the bus had \"packed it in\" and was deemed unroadworthy \"due to both excessive steering column movement and chassis rust\".\n\nThe department then arranged for Luna to be transported between screening sites on a flatbed trailer as a temporary measure, so it could legally remain operating while it sought a permanent solution.\n\nRTI documents reveal there had been attempts to replace the bus since 2023, including one proposal to scrap a replacement altogether in favour of a permanent clinic, although this plan never came to fruition.\n\nOne attempt would have delivered a new bus by June 2025, limiting the service gap to less than three months, but it was abandoned after legal concerns were raised about the risks and liability of using two vendors to supply different components of the bus.\n\nBridget Archer has said \"all attempts must be made\" to get the mobile screening program back on track. (ABC News: Jonny McNee)\n\nWhen will a replacement bus arrive?\n\nIn October, Health Minister Bridget Archer confirmed Varley Group had been chosen to deliver a new mobile breast screening bus, after months of scrutiny over the replacement's progress.\n\nAustralia lagging behind on breast density reporting High breast density elevates a woman's cancer risk, but unlike other countries, Australia doesn't routinely report this information.\n\nIn a media release, Ms Archer said the government \"anticipate[s] that it will be operational by September next year\" and aims to expedite its delivery.\n\nHowever, according to a procurement form included in the RTI documents, Varley Group's \"construction contract is 12 months with an estimated start date of November 2025, followed by a 12-month Defect Liability Period.\"\n\nThis could mean completion in November 2026, two months after the government's timeline, potentially leaving Tasmania without a second screening bus for 20 months.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the discrepancy between the contract end date and the publicly stated delivery timeline for the replacement bus, Ms Archer said \"the department's advice, following the selection of Varley Group as the preferred provider in September, was that delivery should occur within the next 12 months\".\n\nShe added, \"however, given the importance of this service to Tasmania's regions, I have made it clear that all attempts must be made to expedite this timeframe\".\n\nKristie Johnston says it was \"very lucky that things weren't a lot worse\" after the mishaps. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\n'The government should hang their heads in shame'\n\nKristie Johnston, independent MP for Clark, said she was deeply disturbed over the run of events.\n\n\"This department is charged with caring for Tasmanians and their healthcare, and yet they failed to act and protect their staff and protect patients who are accessing the service,\" she said.\n\n\"We're just very lucky that things weren't a lot worse.\n\n\"This is not a luxury service, this is a life-saving service and the government should hang their heads in shame.\n\n\"It's simply not good enough that we could have had a replacement bus service earlier this year with only three months of no service, but now we are waiting at least 18 months.\"\n\nWhat options do women have in the interim?\n\nWomen aged 40 and older are able to book free appointments at Tasmania's fixed breast screening clinics by calling 13 20 50.\n\nThese clinics are located in Hobart, Rosny Park, and Launceston.\n\nA temporary subsidy was introduced in October by the department to help women who, in the absence of a screening bus, need to travel to one of these clinics.\n\nThe scheme applies to all women whose mobile screening appointments were cancelled or missed in 2025 and 2026.\n\nDuring this year's state election campaign, the Liberals promised to build four additional permanent clinics, in Kingborough, Devonport, Triabunna and Glenorchy, but a timeframe for their opening has not been provided.\n\nConstruction recently began on a $15 million Public Diagnostic Breast Care Centre at the Royal Hobart Hospital's Liverpool clinics, a previous promise from the 2024 state election, which is expected to be completed in March 2026.",

This musical accent honoured Tommie Andersson, the orchestra\u2019s foundation theorbo and baroque guitar principal, who is making his final appearances with the ABO this tour after delighting audiences for nearly 40 years. This year\u2019s edition of the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra\u2019s Christmas offering took on a Spanish flavour. Credit: Laura Manariti Under the irrepressibly energetic direction of Paul Dyer, the orchestra and Brandenburg Choir were joined by guest artists Argentinian mezzo-soprano Maria Eugenia Nieva and Australian classical guitarist Andrew Blanch. Wearing a full-length bright red dress with a side slit, Nieva exuded plenty of Latin sensuality. Her strong, dark-chocolate mezzo voice animated a variety of numbers from the traditional carol Ri\u00fa Ri\u00fa Chi\u00fa, through Gioia & Amore by Spanish renaissance composer Soto de Langa and Nana from Six Popular Spanish Songs by Manuel de Falla to Santa la noche, an arrangement of Adolphe Adam\u2019s beloved classic O Holy Night.\n\nBlanch, who featured prominently in the program, was especially brilliant in Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s Leyenda, arranged to showcase the simmering passion of the guitar\u2019s rapid-fire flamenco technique. Once again, the Brandenburg Choir brought sheer delight to the choral aspect of No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! with crisp ensemble and crystalline diction. Between the customary bookends, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, and O Come, All ye Faithful, came some English schmaltz courtesy of John Rutter and Philip Stopford, as well as an intense account of the Kyrie from Palestrina\u2019s Missa Papae Marcelli. In chamber formation, the Brandenburgs themselves were in top form, bringing joyous dynamism to Monn\u2019s Sinfonia in G and whimsy to an arrangement of God Rest ye Merry, Gentlemen. Andersson\u2019s own solos and his poignant accompaniment of Stille Nacht (Silent Night) with its original Austrian lilt mirrored his quiet but impressive dedication. No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! continues to be a distinctive but deservedly popular Christmas tradition.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nParcels: LOVED Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSidney Myer Music Bowl, December 4 I dare you to stand still at a Parcels show. From the minute they hit the stage, the band\u2019s blend of electro-pop and disco-pop rhythms has the crowd possessed, grooving along to the psychedelic funky beat. The Australian five-piece indie band were formed in Byron Bay in 2014, and make the spontaneous move to Berlin that year. They have played some high-profile gigs in 2025, including Coachella and Glastonbury. This weekend, their national tour concludes in Sydney with two gigs on the steps of the Opera House. It\u2019s hard to stand still at a Parcels show. Credit: \u00a9Martin Philbey The band experiments with many different sounds across the set. Opening with Tobeloved, they show off their signature harmonies, reminiscent of The Beach Boys. It\u2019s clear how Berlin Club culture has influenced their music when they perform Gamesofluck, the stage lit with an electric blue as the keys and guitar pulse. They performed Overnight, a single co-produced and co-written with Daft Punk after they attended Parcel\u2019s first-ever show in Paris in 2016; the duo\u2019s electronic influence is evident in the live sound.\n\nFinallyover, their final song, has a much more mellow, retro rock feel like The Beatles. They perform a lengthy instrumental track, which feels improvised, exerting riffs that resemble the disco energy of Boney M and AC/DC\u2019s ultra-rock Thunderstruck. Parcels in full flight. Credit: \u00a9Martin Philbey \u201cI know we are a lot of people, but we move as one tonight,\u201d says one of the band, indistinguishable in the moody lighting, and that collective feeling carries through, maintaining a chill vibe across the entire set. During Summerinlove, the crowd leans into the sexiness with footage of couples kissing in the front row projected onto a heart-shaped kiss cam on the screen above. It\u2019s clear the band are having just as much fun as the crowd. Patrick Hetherington\u2019s foot pounds the stage as Jules Crommelin\u2019s hips thrust against his guitar and Noah Hill\u2019s neck jerks back and forth like a chicken. The band seemed to have as much fun as their energetic audience. Credit: \u00a9Martin Philbey\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of euphoria that fills the atmosphere at the all-ages concert. Like a rave, the infectious beats travel through your ears and all the way to your feet. The band asks tech staff to light up the crowd, as they peer into the masses extending up the theatre and across the green of the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. As Crommelin perches at the end of the stage, he says: \u201cJust going to take a second to take this all in.\u201d What a start to the summer.\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar THEATRE\n\nSoul of Possum \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until December 13 A few months ago, after nearly 10 years of consultation, parliament passed Treaty legislation for Aboriginal Victorians. It\u2019s the first treaty of its kind in Australia and one that not only acknowledges past injustices but also commits to returning decision-making powers to Aboriginal communities. Presented within this context, this latest staging of Soul of Possum serves as a potent and topical reminder of the past that still needs present reckoning. Soul of Possum is based on the experiences of the playwright\u2019s ancestors. Credit: Darren Gill\n\nBased on the personal histories of playwright Brodie Murray\u2019s ancestors (in particular his father and grandfather), the play is a taut reenactment of an altercation between colonial soldiers and members of an Indigenous population on the Murray River in Swan Hill. With a few cast changes, Soul of Possum\u2019s latest iteration follows on from a successful season at Castlemaine State Festival and Yirramboi Festival in 2021. It\u2019s 1853, in Wamba Wamba Country and Marnuu (Balla Neba) is troubled by his dreams; the voice of Possum predicts wide-scale destruction by a hostile force, a devastation of both people and wildlife. But his fellow warriors Gundi (Wimiya Woodley) and Barru (Murray) are sceptical and mock his warnings. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a steamboat moored at the river, with a military expedition about to disembark to open up the country for \u201cglorious empire\u201d. It\u2019s a story most of us should know; this first contact skirmish between two parties who are completely alien to the other\u2019s customs and cultures, and the resulting and continuing legacy of settler-occupation. The play asks us to imagine what it was actually like in the initial round of invasion and resistance, a pattern that would repeat itself across the land. The play is a taut renactment of an altercation between colonial soldiers and members of an Indigenous population on the Murray River in Swan Hill. Credit: Darren Gill\n\nThe stage is sparse except for a large projection of the riverbank at the back, two platforms on the left that serve as the steamboat and a clump of river reeds, a tree, and a campfire to the right. Preview night brought some rushed dialogue from the trio of warriors that should hopefully settle for the rest of the season. Maybe they feel there\u2019s no time to waste: under Beng Oh\u2019s direction, the 70-minute narrative moves fast, with the plight of both sets of white and blackfellas played out in alternate scenes before they finally meet. Loading What makes Soul of Possum interesting is that it dramatises the internecine in-fighting among each group. The First Nations Australians lose valuable time arguing about what to do with the threat of territorial trespass while the English marauders - Captain Gibbons (Leigh Scully), Lieutenant Bankes (Gabriel Partington), Dr Wilkins (Kevin Dee) and Irish convict Yates (Luke Mason) have their own on-board power conflicts to contend with. All four characters are performed with ease and conviction. There\u2019s an earnestness about this play and some unnecessary repetition in the script. The ending that brings us back to the present day also seems a bit too expository after everything that we\u2019ve witnessed before. Nonetheless, Soul of Possum does manage to take us into the crossfire of colonial violence in its short, sharp stage time.\n\nReviewed by Thuy On\n\nSoul of Possum was reviewed from a preview performance",

    "text": "\u201cAnika Wells was working on that trip as sports minister, participating in the lifting up of parasport. That\u2019s been driven by Anika Wells,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are rules there, and I\u2019m not going to go through each and every one. I\u2019ve got a big job, David [Insiders host David Speers]. It\u2019s completely within the rules. \u201cThere\u2019s family reunion entitlements \u2013 all the travel that\u2019s within the guidelines. She was working and there were announcements and there were events there.\u201d Wells is also under pressure over her use of taxpayer entitlements to attend a friend\u2019s birthday party in Adelaide, the sky-high cost of flights to New York for meetings at the United Nations and her use of expenses on trips to France undertaken as Sports minister. Wells faces multiple expenses questions\n\nSports and Communications Minister Anika Wells has been under pressure to justify travel expenses. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Wells has been under fire since Wednesday after revelations she charged taxpayers more than $100,000 for flights to New York to showcase Australia\u2019s social media ban. Loading This was swiftly followed by reports she had used her travel entitlements for trips to Adelaide, where she attended a friend\u2019s birthday party, and three trips to France in one year in her role as sports minister to attend the Rugby World Cup and the Olympics. The furore over Wells\u2019 use of expenses has overshadowed the minister\u2019s attempts to promote new laws that restrict under 16s\u2019 use of social media, which come into effect this Wednesday.\n\nIndependent Parliamentary Expenses Authority figures show the minister claimed $844 of taxpayer-funded travel allowance to stay at a resort in Thredbo over the two nights, and then claimed another $318 to stay in Canberra on Sunday night citing \u201cparliamentary duties\u201d. Her flights from Brisbane to Canberra, the nearest major airport to the Thredbo resort, cost taxpayers another $294.32. Wells was accompanied by her husband, Finn McCarthy, and two of her three children under \u201cfamily reunion\u201d rules that allow MPs to reunite with their families when travelling for work. Taxpayers spent another $1389.18 on flights so her family could join her for the weekend at the snow, with Wells\u2019 husband posting pictures of their children on the skiing trip a couple of days later on social media. All told, the two-day trip to the ski fields cost taxpayers $2845.50, but a government spokesman defended the minister\u2019s use of travel and entitlements, saying \u201cthe travel was in accordance with the guidelines\u201d.\n\nBut Wells\u2019 use of the family reunion rules is strikingly similar to a trip the current Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke took to Uluru back in April 2012, when he was the environment minister, and claimed $12,000 in allowances and flights so his family could join him on that trip. Details of Burke\u2019s trip emerged in 2015, soon after the Bronwyn Bishop \u201cchoppergate\u201d scandal. At the time, Burke insisted, like Wells, that he had not breached the rules but he did admit the trip was \u201cbeyond community expectations\u201d of what MPs should be claiming in taxpayer-funded expenses. Burke repaid $8656.48 of that trip \u2013 the cost of four airfares \u2013 five years later, in 2020. There is no suggestion that Wells contravened the rules on the trip to Thredbo because of her official engagements, but the expenses claims raise fresh questions about her use of entitlements and whether they are in line with \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers was asked last week on the ABC\u2019s 730 program if Wells\u2019 trip to New York passed the pub test, and argued: \u201cThat\u2019s for others to judge. But from my point of view, it\u2019s official travel. It\u2019s well within the guidelines.\u201d The rules for what expenses and allowances ministers can claim are governed by the Department of Finance\u2019s \u201cdominant purpose\u201d test. Loading That test states that expense claims can be made for one of four reasons \u2013 when an MP or minister is undertaking parliamentary duties, electorate duties, party political duties or official duties. On its website, the department states that \u201cthe dominant purpose test asks whether you would have undertaken the activity or incurred or claimed the expense, allowance or other public resource but for your parliamentary business\u201d.\n\nThe rules on reunions allow family members to travel from their home base to Canberra, with a maximum annual cost limit set as the equivalent value of nine business-class return airfares to Canberra for an MP\u2019s partner, plus three economy-class return airfares to Canberra for each dependent child. Parliament\u2019s Senate estimates committee heard last week that Wells, a staffer and a public servant had spent almost $100,000 on flights to attend the United Nations General Assembly and another $70,000 to host an event that spruiked the government\u2019s teen social media ban earlier this year. After a difficult appearance at the National Press Club last week during which Wells avoided directly answering questions about her New York trip, The Australian Financial Review then revealed the under-pressure minister took a three-day taxpayer-funded $3600 trip in June to Adelaide. During that trip, Wells attended a friend\u2019s birthday party as well as official meetings with state ministers.",

Or, if it still exists, it\u2019s at least usually complemented by some quality alternative eateries, maybe in one of those la-di-da outdoor dining precincts with a playground, a water feature and those cool timber lounge chairs. Westfield Chermside in Brisbane\u2019s north. Jamila Toderas But not all shopping centres are equal \u2013 particularly the big dogs: your Garden Cities, Indooroopillys and Chermsides \u2013 which is odd when so much else of the experience tends to be pretty consistent. Which is best? We wanted to find out, so over the past 12 months or so, we\u2019ve spent more time than we probably should hanging around the city\u2019s biggest suburban shopping centres to trial their eateries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Monster 800-seat brewpub touches down near Brisbane Airport Before you ask: no, food-angled shopping centres like Market Square, Sunny Park et al. don\u2019t count, nor does the CBD. This is the big suburban retail centres with a few anchor tenants like Myer or David Jones. We found you can get something half decent to eat at all these places. Still, there was one clear winner. 5. Westfield Carindale What are you doing, Carindale? This stalwart in the city\u2019s south-east is a good shopping experience as far as malls go, but its food options lag the centres further up this list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re not going to go hungry at Westfield Carindale, but it lags some of the other centres around town. Tammy Law You\u2019re never going to eat poorly here, but it\u2019s dominated by what I call \u201castroturfers\u201d \u2013 the chains that have picked up on a trending cuisine and done a certainly passable, very replicable, but not particularly exciting take on it: think Grill\u2019d for burgers, Roll\u2019d for Vietnamese, or Guzman y Gomez for Mexican. But it is getting better. Yes, David\u2019s Noodle & Hotpot is a chain, but it does very good malatang. There\u2019s Foster & Black and Cafe Halo for coffee, or Gong Cha for bubble tea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s also a Cinnabon, which hit Australia like a hurricane a couple of years back with cinnamon scrolls that are legitimately better than most independents. Cinnabon\u2019s tightly spiralled buns. So, a pass mark, I guess. But there are better options in Brisbane when you want to shop and feed. 4. Indooroopilly Shopping Centre Despite its fancy expansion in 2014, which added high-end retailers such as Scanlan Theodore, Aquila and Zimmermann, Indooroopilly Shopping Centre\u2019s eating options remained pretty underwhelming for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndooroopilly lagged behind other shopping centres for dining, but it\u2019s getting better. But it was the first centre outside Sunnybank to get a Hakataya Ramen, and from there, it\u2019s slowly become better and better. Motto Motto, from Sonos owner William Liu, is always worth a shout (it has an outlet in a lot of shopping malls around the south-east) for fast-paced Japanese. And the centre over-represents on specialty coffee, with both Foster & Black and Archer present and correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gold, though, is on the ground floor, where there\u2019s a Cinnabon and a David\u2019s Noodle & Hot Pot. Also, check out The Butcher\u2019s Grill: little more than a grill-and-counter setup attached to Andrew\u2019s Meats, its classic Angus beef burger \u2013 basically, a gussied up take on an old-school Australian barbecue burger (refreshing, in the face of the American-style onslaught) \u2013 has gone up in price recently, but is still one of the better value burgs around town. 3. Westfield North Lakes If you tend to breeze through Westfield North Lakes just to get to Ikea, you\u2019re missing out, because the centre boasts a stack of good food options.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, there\u2019s a TGI Fridays and an El Camino Cantina, and a whole lot of other phone-it-ins, but there are also a bunch of delicious alternatives: see Lanzhou Beef Noodle for hand-pulled Chinese noodle soup, Kinn for fast-paced, fragrant and wallet-friendly Thai, and Chicken Park for fried bird. There\u2019s also Smiling Dumplings and Noodles for, yep, dumplings and noodles, Bapboi for Korean barbecue, and the family run Ka-Chow Asian Kitchen for pan-south-east Asian. No need to resort to Swedish meatballs here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Westfield Chermside Now we\u2019re getting serious. Chermside is the third-largest shopping mall in Australia and, since the addition of its outdoor dining precinct in 2017, has bulked up its food options to match. Westfield Chermside\u2019s sunny outdoor dining precinct. There\u2019s a bunch of good options here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTry Momo for crisply fried Korean chicken, Kinn+Derm for legit Thai, and Hanok for Korean barbecue. Also, Simone Presta and Carmine Guarino recently opened a second instalment of their terrific fast-paced Italian eatery Scugnizzi. Scugnizzi serves quality fast-paced Italian. Morgan Roberts Elsewhere, there\u2019s Archer, Foster & Black and Be Kalii for coffee; Yo-Bar for self-serve frozen yoghurt and acai; Hakataya for ramen; NYC Bagel Deli for stacked bagels; and David\u2019s Noodle & Hotpot for malatang. That\u2019s just a taste of the independents (and smaller, quality chains), and then you have the big-box operators and fast food spots on top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaken altogether, it\u2019s well pitched and impressive in its ambition and utility, particularly when you consider Chermside probably didn\u2019t have to do this \u2013 it\u2019s not like the surrounding suburb heaves with restaurants and cafes. 1. Westfield Mt Gravatt Will any Brisbane shopping centre ever top Garden City for food? Probably not. And will anyone ever stop calling it Garden City? Again, probably not. Westfield Mount Gravatt (aka Garden City) is the clear winner when it comes to shopping centre food. Tammy Law\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis huge shopping mall \u2013 the eighth-largest in the country \u2013 is the solar plexus of Brisbane\u2019s multicultural southern suburbs, and that\u2019s reflected in the giddy breadth of its food options. It was already reasonably good before the centre opened its outside dining precinct in 2014. Then, on top of that, there\u2019s the 8 Street Asian food precinct downstairs, plus a bunch of good spots scattered in between. Where to start? The atrium at the top of the escalators at the north-western end of the centre is as good as any. Here, your Oportos, McDonalds and KFCs sit alongside operators such as 1919 Lanzhou Beef Noodle, with its unctuous, spicy bowls of hand-pulled Chinese noods; New Shanghai and its lengthy menu of house-made dim sum; and Hokkaido, with its perfectly flaked baked cheese tarts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWander down one of the halls to the outside dining precinct and you could eat at Betty\u2019s, Vapiano or Nando\u2019s, or get classy yum cha at Yum Cha Cuisine, killer Malaysian (including one of the best char kway teows in town) at Ya Hoo Kitchen, or well-pitched sushi at Sushi Edo. Hokkaido\u2019s famous cheese tarts. And then there\u2019s 8 Street, a charming facsimile of the kind of food alley you might find in Bangkok or Hong Kong. Here, there\u2019s a bunch of hole-in-the-wall vendors serving malatang, chongqing noodles, ramen, bibimbap and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScattered about other parts of the centre are a Hakataya Ramen, a Foster & Black and a David\u2019s Master Pot malatang joint. If you need to eat while you shop, Garden City is the spot.\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

They can't provide them,\" Bamyan's CEO, Ali Sarwari, said.\n\n\n\n\"They have no relationship or communication with the inside.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Muir, chief of protocol at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and a former ambassador to Qatar, told SBS News it's clear the embassy cannot continue to operate as it has been.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ambassador was sent and accredited to represent a sending state. In practice, that accreditation requires a subordinate of the sending state,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That state no longer exists and practical risks are accruing around the provision of the services of the embassy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Independent senator Fatima Payman, who was born in Kabul and fled to Australia as a child , said losing the embassy would be like \"the second fall of Afghanistan\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will be the second fall of Afghanistan.

    "text": "A senior federal minister is defending her taxpayer-funded trips as being within government guidelines, as new details emerge about other costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnika Wells came under fire for the $100,000 cost of flying herself and three staff to New York to promote Australia's social media age ban, with further details emerging about trips she took to Paris, Thredbo and Adelaide.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe accepted the spending would elicit a \"gut reaction\" in the average Australian, but said it was an independent agency booking flights, rather than her browsing \"Webjet\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWells was supposed to travel to New York on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Royal Air Force jet in September, but was delayed because of the fallout from a deadly Optus triple-zero outage.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO What to expect as the under-16s social media ban begins SBS News 07:06 English\n\n\"People can have an opinion about whether it was worth the money,\" Wells told Sky News on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But for me, the policy imperative that the life-changing work that we are trying to do ... it was really important and I stand by it.\"\n\n\n\nAlbanese defends spending as details emerge about other trips\n\nAlbanese defended the spending as within the guidelines and said the New York trip to promote the social media ban, which will come into effect on Wednesday, was \"very significant\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was an important event that led directly to the European Union taking action,\" he told ABC's Insiders on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the comments I heard from various UN officials was ... 'this is the first time I've been to a forum that has changed my mind'.\"\n\n\n\nWells, who is also the sports minister, reportedly took three trips to Paris in 12 months at a cost of $116,000, to attend major sporting events including the Rugby World Cup, Paris Olympics and Paris Paralympics.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was authorised to spend $6,000 on meals for five days, with one dinner reportedly billed for $600.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I recall sometimes I was eating a muesli bar in the car. These are big days,\" Wells said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I appreciate it looks a certain way because it's Paris, but that is where the Games were.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition industry spokesperson Alex Hawke said the spending did not pass the pub test, adding the expenses were so high they would \"make the royals blush\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It simply doesn't stack up and the minister's defences don't seem to stack up either,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the minister is eating a muesli bar ... then why is the taxpayer being charged for expensive dinners ... if she's not partaking of them.\"\n\n\n\nWells was also questioned about using travel entitlements to attend a friend's birthday while on a three-day, $3,600 work trip to Adelaide in June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I met with my South Australian counterpart in part about the South Australian Sport Institute, where we opened a para unit,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minister also spent $3,000 on flights and allowances for her husband and children to join her at Thredbo in June 2024 while she attended meetings with Paralympics Australia and Adaptive Festival organisers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWells acknowledged her family went skiing, but said she was there to work and the trip was within the family reunion and travel guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, current Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke took a work trip to Uluru and claimed $12,000 so his family could join him.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile within the rules, he repaid $8,656 of that trip when details emerged in 2015, admitting it was \"beyond community expectations\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWells did not indicate she would be paying any of the money back, and said \"I work really hard\" and that she will keep following the rules \"as I have in every single instance\".\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Ethel used to work long days picking fruit in regional NSW. But after falling off a tractor four months ago, she can barely move.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 33-year-old first came to Australia from Solomon Islands in 2022 under the federal government's Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PALM scheme is a temporary visa program designed to plug Australia's labour shortages by recruiting workers from nine Pacific Island nations and Timor-Leste.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthel \u2014 whose name SBS News has changed for privacy reasons \u2014 was initially employed under the scheme to work on a farm in northern Queensland but left after just four months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe take-home pay was more modest than she expected. After deductions, she says there was barely enough left to survive on, let alone support her family in Solomon Islands \u2014 the main reason she joined the scheme.\n\n\n\nEthel says $1,100 was deducted from her first pay for reasons that were unclear, leaving her with $500. Then, after paying rent and transport, she had only $200 left over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Family at home [were] asking for more money and we would send but we [were] left with nothing and that's why we left the PALM scheme,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's among the thousands of workers who have absconded from the scheme , citing poor working conditions, exploitation and, in some instances, abuse. The Department of Home Affairs confirmed in a statement to SBS News that there are more than 7,000 disengaged PALM scheme workers in Australia. Many are living either unlawfully (without a visa) or on a bridging visa awaiting further determination.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a disengaged worker without a visa, Ethel has no work rights or access to government support, relying instead on the help of the local community, volunteers, and charities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a situation that has left her \u2014 and many others \u2014 vulnerable to exploitation and injury.\n\n\n\nAustralia's hidden workforce\n\nSince leaving the PALM scheme in 2022, Ethel has been working illegally in regional Australia, receiving cash in hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August this year, while working at a farm in the regional NSW town of Leeton, she fell off a tractor and severely injured her leg.\n\n\n\nEthel has scars on her leg from an injury she sustained while working illegally on a farm in regional NSW. Source: Supplied Ethel spent a week in bed before the president of the volunteer-run Leeton Multicultural Support Group, Paul Maytom, was alerted. He took her to hospital where she spent three weeks and underwent three surgeries.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked what would have happened if Maytom hadn't intervened, Ethel couldn't bring herself to answer, just shaking her head and pursing her lips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Paul helped me so much, I thank Paul so much and Red Cross,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaytom first arrived in Leeton in 1967 to pick fruit. He served on the local council for 34 years and was mayor for 16 of those. Now retired, the 77-year-old spends his time helping disengaged workers like Ethel, even using his own money to pay for her medication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The people that I've worked with over the last 18 months, they're people that either don't have enough money because they've got sick, or they got injured and there's no cover,\" he tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has dozens of notebooks filled with information about the people he's helped \u2014 detailing accounts of underpayment, mistreatment and exploitation. He points to the case of one woman whose employment picking strawberries was terminated because she became pregnant.\n\n\n\nWe have a process that clearly upfront says that you have the same rights as Australian workers but yet that [an unfair dismissal] can happen.\n\nMaytom says he wants Australians to know the hidden plight of these hidden workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe if they understand what I know, they would accept and understand that these people are not really causing us any problem but they're caught in a trap and we need to help,\" he says.\n\n\n\nPaul Maytom has been supporting disengaged workers in Leeton in NSW for the past 18 months. Source: SBS News The number of disengaged workers in the PALM scheme ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), which, along with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is jointly responsible for the scheme, set up a disengagement taskforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for DEWR declined to confirm the total number of disengaged workers but told SBS News in a statement that \"the employer-reported disengagement rate\" among PALM workers has declined \"from 10 per cent in 2020-21 to 3 per cent in 2024-25\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Addressing PALM worker disengagement is a priority for the Australian Government. Wherever possible, the Australian Government seeks to support the re-engagement of disengaged PALM workers,\" the spokesperson said, adding that a dedicated response team has been established to implement recommendations from the taskforce,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reasons why PALM workers have left the scheme vary, but many have pointed to problems arising from pay deductions, wage theft, mistreatment, insufficient work and being tied to a single employer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA report by the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre noted employers are allowed to make deductions from the wages of PALM workers, which means they are sometimes left with just $100-$200 per week.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Labor criticised over worker visa rule backflip that could affect thousands\n\nPALM workers are also not allowed to leave their employer without approval from the DEWR.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, many workers experiencing hardship are faced with three choices: to stick with their employer, leave the scheme and return home, or abscond and seek cash-in-hand work.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut returning home isn't a simple option for many, including Ethel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to Solomon Islands in five months, we have nothing because they give us more deduction,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow Solomon Islands-born PALM worker Constantino Waowao also feels his options are limited. He says mistreatment by his employer in regional NSW caused him to leave the scheme in 2022.\n\n\n\nConstantino Waowao is one of many disengaged workers who cannot return home. Source: SBS News / Apple Photos Clean Up But the 43-year-old says he can't go back to Solomon Islands out of fear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm gay, I will never go back, if I go back they will kill me, that's why I'm here,\" Waowao tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince January 2023, he has been on a bridging visa, awaiting a decision on his protection status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't feel happy about this because I need protection now,\" he says.\n\n\n\nIllegal work necessary, but risky\n\nDespite the lack of protections, there is no shortage of work for disengaged workers, especially in agriculture.\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Davidson is a fifth-generation family farmer who grows oranges in Leeton and regularly employs seasonal workers. He tells SBS News he wants a better model for seasonal work that doesn\u2019t rely on disengaged workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think everyone can acknowledge it is a problem and we need to address it, it's not sustainable,\"\" he says.\n\n\n\nFarmer Justin Davidson says disengaged PALM workers deserve a second chance. Source: SBS News Davidson says he wants to see better protections and employment opportunities offered to those who have disengaged from the PALM scheme, and that he empathises with those who seek out cash-in-hand jobs.\n\n\n\nThese people need a second chance, they need income.\n\nKen Dachi from not-for-profit multicultural support organisation Welcoming Australia says allowing workers to move more easily between employers signed up to the PALM scheme would lead to fewer disengaged workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The name gives it away, it's the Pacific Australian Mobility Scheme, so the mobility component doesn't exist, it needs to be explicit and activated,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nFar from an issue only affecting the regions or the towns dependent on this shadow workforce, Dachi points out that the fruit picked by disengaged workers ends up in homes across the country.\n\n\n\nWelcoming Australia's Ken Dachi wants to see more flexibility introduced to the scheme. Source: SBS News / Apple Photos Clean Up \"A certain percentage of the food we buy every day is from the hands of a disengaged worker; it's exploited labour that contributed to its coming to the shelf,\" he says.\n\n\n\nModern slavery risks\n\nIssues stemming from the PALM scheme have been well-documented, with corroborated reports of exploitation and work site fatalities prompting the NSW government to establish a parliamentary inquiry into modern slavery in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for DEWR, there have been 104 deaths among workers participating in the PALM scheme (or its predecessors) dating back to 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The death of any PALM scheme worker is a tragedy, and the department extends its sympathies to the families, friends, employers and communities,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the majority of fatalities stemmed from \"medical conditions\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state's anti-slavery commissioner James Cockayne says disengaged workers are at significant risk of exploitation such as debt bondage, forced labour, deceptive recruitment, sexual harassment and violence and sexual servitude.\n\n\n\n\"At the margins, we see people, particularly when they disengage from the scheme, becoming very, very vulnerable to very serious exploitation, so serious that it rises to the level of modern slavery,\" Cockayne says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe blames labour hire companies for \"overcharging people for certain services like laundry, transport, access to refrigeration\", which he says pushes people into \"a hamster wheel of debt\".\n\n\n\nSBS News is investigating experiences of modern slavery in Australia. Have you got a story to share?\n\nGet in touch at investigations@sbs.com.au or contact Catalina Florez at catalina.florez@sbs.com.au.\n\nCockayne says there is also no licensing requirement for labour hire companies in NSW, making it attractive for \"dodgy\" companies to move to NSW from states where they are required to get a licence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Companies are moving here because the lack of licensing means that it's easier to make more profit, which, of course, is a synonym for exploit more people more easily,\" he says.\n\n\n\nNSW anti-slavery commissioner James Cockayne describes the exploitation faced by some PALM workers as \"serious\". Source: SBS News A NSW government spokesperson told SBS News: \"NSW has been actively engaged with the Commonwealth Government and other jurisdictions with a view to establishing a National Labour Hire Licencing Scheme, as recommended by the 2019 Migrant Workers' Taskforce.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"SafeWork takes a proactive approach to addressing safety, including through information provision, engagement with industry, and proactive compliance checks across NSW,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalls to a hotline run by Cockayne's office, 1800 Freedom, have increased by 116 per cent since this time last year, says the commissioner, adding that around half the calls received each week are connected to labour hire companies and, in many cases, the PALM scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Welcoming Australia, there are currently more than 30,000 PALM scheme workers in Australia. In the 2024\u201325 financial year, it's projected that workers participating in the scheme will pay more than $180 million in income tax.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australia Institute has found more than 230 Pacific Island workers were seriously injured and 45 died in Australia between 2020 and 2023.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO 'It broke us, the whole feeling of shame, anger, despair': Modern slavery survivor SBS News 08:25 English\n\nGiven the high percentage of deaths among a relatively small number of participants, Cockayne is alarmed at the lack of political urgency to fix the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe puts it down to a lack of political pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many of the stakeholders don't vote in Australia, the temporary migrant workers don't vote, their governments don't vote,\" he says.\n\n\n\nA history of migrant worker exploitation\n\nMoe Turaga arrived in Australia from Fiji in 1988 to help support his family.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis dad died when he was 13 years old, after which point Turaga says his mum struggled to make ends meet.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis cousin promised him he could study and earn more than $25 a week working in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It felt like a good option to come out and help mum out as well and also to develop my young siblings' journey,\" he says.\n\n\n\nUpon arrival, Turaga's passport was confiscated, and he was told he owed a debt for travel and visa costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe worked at a regional grape farm in Victoria to earn money to pay off the debt and help his family. His cousin assured him his wages were being sent back to his family.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after two years, Turaga decided to call his mum from a pay phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's when the penny dropped, that two years of our hard work, our families have never seen any money, nor did we,\" he says.\n\n\n\nTo this day, that question rings in my ears, when my mum asked me 'are you ever going to send money home?'\n\n\"To think that two years of our hard work \u2014 slogging it out in the middle of Victoria, in the winters and the summer \u2014 think that our families are not getting the fruits of our labour, we were absolutely devastated,\" Turaga says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe escaped the farm and found refuge in a local church.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuraga eventually recovered his passport, secured a visa and appropriate work.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's now a citizen, working as an advocate for others experiencing modern slavery.\n\n\n\nMoe Turaga says Australia has a long history of exploiting migrant workers. Source: SBS News Turaga regularly shares his story to make sure that what happened to him doesn't happen to other migrant workers. But he says he now gets hundreds of calls a week from exploited Pacific workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it's not easy for workers to just go home when they face hardship in the PALM scheme, largely for cultural and safety reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're not going home with a bit of shame because if these guys go home with no money to their families and if they've been debt\u2013bonded \u2014 if they've borrowed money to come over \u2014 that can be fatal,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Leeton has a reputation for welcoming newcomers (signs in the town read \"Leeton welcomes refugees, migrants and new settlers\"), Dachi says their support systems aren't designed to manage the scale and complexity associated with widespread worker disengagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Goodwill is not a strategy. Is it sustainable? No, there's donor fatigue, there's volunteer fatigue,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaytom agrees more coordinated support is needed. He wants to see safety nets formalised for disengaged workers, such as interim health cover and an amnesty offered to allow the ghost workforce to be re-engaged into the scheme.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO NSW inquiry finds more than 40,000 people trapped in modern slavery SBS News 00:57 English\n\n\"I have a good network of people around me, from their countries that do their best to support them while they can, but it can't go on forever,\" Maytom says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're sort of getting overloaded at the moment, I'm grateful for whatever support we can get but we can't keep on doing what we're doing, we must find a way forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News also contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for this story, but did not receive a response by the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders who have concerns about modern slavery can contact 1800 FREEDOM on 1800 3733366 or at antislavery@dcj.nsw.gov.au for confidential support and assistance from the NSW anti-slavery Commissioner.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "On a Saturday in mid-November, seven-time bridesmaid Merlyn Romit geared up for another wedding, but one without a happy couple.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the first event hosted by the 29-year-old Indian Australian's wedding planning company \u2014 and, to her knowledge, the first of its kind in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I came up with this idea three months ago , when one of my friends actually showed a similar event that's been done overseas,\" Romit told SBS Spice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The concept of immersive weddings and actually enjoying them for what they are, without the fuss of it, was actually done in India first, and then Ireland and London. I wanted to be one of the first to bring it to Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter months of planning, Romit saw her efforts come to life as over a hundred guests arrived at the event's waterfront location on Sydney's North Shore. They'd each paid between $90 and $109 to attend.\n\n\n\nMerlyn Romit, the founder of wedding planning company Desi Wed Australia, dazzled in a blush pink lehenga as she greeted guests at the Big Fat 'Fake' Indian Wedding. Source: Supplied / Sidd Rishi They ranged from engaged couples with pending nuptials to community members keen to experience the colour and vibrancy for which South Asian weddings are known.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendee Abhijit, 33, said: \"I think for a long time they were like very traditional, family orientated. Now people let loose and actually have a good time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShoraye Khatter, co-director of event partner Brown Munde Events, said \"we're at an age right now where people are missing out [on attending weddings]\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those people that don't go to weddings, they really want to experience it,\" he told SBS Spice.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile marriage rates have now returned to roughly pre-pandemic levels, event vendors are keen to make up for lost time \u2014 something Romit also considered when planning her event.\n\n\n\n\"After being a bridesmaid seven times, I found out how difficult it was to plan a South Asian wedding in Australia. And so, I just wanted to create a space that really brings the top vendors in our industry together,\" Romit said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendee Nadisha, 36, said: \"I'm in the wedding industry, so I wanted to come along and see what all the vendors were up to ... see them showcasing all their beautiful efforts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom marigold flower garlands adorning the entrance, to a vibrant mehendi (henna) station and an abundant biryani bar, the fake wedding invited guests to participate in both familiar and new customs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaree Whitlock from venue partner Zest Waterfront Venues said it's a good opportunity for people to learn about South Asian culture and have some fun.\n\n\n\nOne of the offerings exhibited by a vendor was a giant pavlova that newlyweds can help decorate for their wedding guests. Source: Supplied / Sidd Rishi \"I obviously don't come from [a South Asian] background so, for me culturally, it's so exciting to see something that's a little bit different that I kind of haven't been immersed in before,\" Whitlock told SBS Spice.\n\n\n\nMatrimony and money\n\nAside from the elephant archway framing the event's DJ booth, the buzz of the event was sobered by another elephant in the room \u2014 the rampant costs associated with South Asian weddings.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the average wedding has been estimated to cost over $36,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a South Asian wedding can be anything but average, often spanning over five days with various ceremonies depending on the cultural roots of the betrothed couple.\n\n\n\nAttendees also had the chance to briefly become Vogue cover models. Source: Supplied / Sidd Rishi Earlier this year, SBS Spice spoke to Sydney-based wedding planner Poonam Gururajan about how much her clients regularly shelled out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The smallest wedding I've ever worked on, I think it was around $45,000 to $50,000. That was just for the one day,\" Gururajan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you're looking at multi-day celebrations, it's anywhere from $150,000 to $500,000. When you talk about destination weddings, anywhere up to $800,000.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extravagance of South Asian weddings is no secret \u2014 perhaps most clearly demonstrated by the lavish , extensive 2024 nuptial festivities of Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani's son, Anant Ambani, with Radhika Merchant, which included performances by Rihanna and Justin Bieber.\n\n\n\nThe evening's celebrations included a classic game of musical chairs. Source: Supplied / Sidd Rishi Even before the Ambani wedding, the opulence of matrimonial ceremonies in the diaspora has progressively escalated in line with the rising cost of living, social media trends, and the improved accommodation of South Asian weddings by vendors outside the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the core of any South Asian wedding is always community, as shown by the warmth among attendees at Sydney's recent fake wedding, even if they'd come together for different reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother attendee, 28-year-old Rahul, said: \"It's so rare to meet such a diverse group of people within our own community. And so, for me, that's what's important about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're bold, we're different, we're challenging the norm,\" Romit said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Spice.\n\n\n\n",

And we've always punched well above our weight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the first time Australia has been drawn in the same group as a host nation since the very first time they were in ever in a World Cup, in West Germany in 1974.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia played the US in a friendly in Denver in October, losing two goals to one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exact dates, times, and venues for the entire group stage will be confirmed by FIFA tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we have a fair idea of what the Australian World Cup campaign will look like - and the news is good for the Socceroos, as they'll likely be based on the west coast of North America.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopovic says that's a logistical advantage, amongst other things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, the east coast is a lot further for us- we have to land in the west and get another flight to the east. So, I'm sure the fans are a lot happier, and I anticipate they'd be going through their phones, and trying hard to get tickets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe likely schedule - again, FIFA will confirm everything tomorrow - has Australia starting its campaign against the yet-to-be-determined European side in Vancouver on June the 14th.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey'll then play the United States in Seattle on June the 20th, before playing Paraguay in Santa Clara- about an hour's drive south-east of downtown San Francisco- on June the 26th.\n\n\n\n\n\nParaguay are a familiar opponent for Popovic- he played his last-ever game for the Socceroos against them, back in 2006 in Brisbane.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmongst a logjam of teams, they took the last automatic qualifying spot from South America this time around... and Popovic says he knows just how good they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of respect for South American teams. We saw how close they were to even getting second place in the group. So, a very good team. We anticipate a really tough match.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what of drawing a team from the European playoffs?\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkiye will start favourites to take that spot, but Popovic says he has no preferred opponent out of the four nations involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also says not knowing the opponent until next year won't matter in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is harder. You can scout four teams. But, once March comes around, I'm sure there will be enough time for them, and us, to know the opposition well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this expanded 48-team men's World Cup, the top two teams in each of the twelve groups, as well as the eight best third-placed teams, go through to the knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nA World Cup appearance - Australia's sixth in a row, and seventh overall - will provide a much-needed boost for the whole of Australian football.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootball Australia interim Chief Executive, Heather Garriock, says it should serve as a reminder of the importance of the domestic A-League competition, where many of the Australian squad started their careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, it's a credit to Tony. He's obviously bled 13 players that have debuted for Australia in the last twelve months- that is really unheard of. So, to build the depth within Australian football, it's a credit to Tony, but also a credit to the A-Leagues back home. So, it plays a really crucial role. And to see the youth get an opportunity, week in and week out, under pressure, it's really important for us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what will Popovic's Socceroos show the world in North America next year?\n\n\n\n\n\nPopovic acknowledges this bunch lack the sort of big names Australia had back in his playing days- but he says that won't hold Australia back, as they try to repeat their heroics in reaching the knockout stage of the last World Cup, in Qatar in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got a lot of young, good players coming through. Players that I think will have big careers in years to come. And this is a chance for them to be on the world stage. They'll see an exciting group. A confident group. And one that will give their all for our country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Cup opens on June the 12th...with a repeat of the 2010 World Cup's opening game...as Mexico hosts South Africa in Mexico City.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other two teams in Group A are South Korea and a European playoff winner- either Denmark, Czechia, the Republic or Ireland, or North Macedonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup B features co-hosts Canada, Asian champions Qatar, Switzerland, and another European playoff winner... one of Italy, Wales, Bosnia and Herzegovina, or Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup C has in it five-time champions Brazil, 2022 semi-finalists Morocco, Haiti, and Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup E features heavyweights Germany, Ecuador, African champions the Ivory Coast, and the smallest country to ever make a World Cup,...Curacao... population, 158,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup F shapes up as one of the toughest.... with the Netherlands, Japan, and Tunisia to be joined by whoever emerges from a playoff containing Ukraine, Poland, Albania, and Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup G features Belgium, Egypt, Iran, and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup H contains European champions Spain, Uruguay, Cape Verde, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup I comprises France- who came oh-so-close to winning the world title four years ago- Senegal, Norway, and the winner of an intercontinental playoff comprising Iraq, Bolivia, and Suriname.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup J is the group of defending world champions Argentina.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir opposition comprises Austria, Algeria, and Jordan.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup K features Portugal, Colombia, first-time qualifiers Uzbekistan, and the winner of playoff comprising Jamaica, New Caledonia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Group L has provided England some tough opposition, as they look for the first world title since 1966.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey must face 2018 runners-up Croatia, African power Ghana, and Panama.\n\n\n\n",

She was everybody's friend. She had lots of friends. She was sporty, athletic. She just made the most of life. It was almost like she lived an entire life in 11 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a rare and aggressive type of deadly brain cancer that forms in the brain stem - it mainly affects children.\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia says Pippa's diagnosis was shattering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your whole world comes crumbling down. At that point, I didn't realise that it was the worst possible tumour that anybody could be delivered, but I'd never had experience with brain tumours. You know that brain tumours are bad but to know the extent of that - I didn't know at the time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cancer is challenging to treat due to its location and infiltrative nature, making surgical removal impossible - so survival rates are so low.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamilies are often told to spend their time making memories.\n\n\n\n\n\nPippa died 21 months after she was diagnosed.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was just 11 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were very fortunate that we had 21 months and the majority of that time Pippa was relatively well and she was able to travel with us, so one of the best memories was living out her dream and taking her to Paris, and that's just something that remains with our family forever. It was a very beautiful and special time and we spent two weeks there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Cancer Research Foundation has awarded a $2.5 million grant to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will fund a lab dedicated to research treatments for brain cancers like DIPG in children and glioblastoma - another aggressive type of brain cancer - in adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nKerry Strydom is the C-E-O of the Cancer Research Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There really isn't a fantastic treatment option at the moment and what we are hoping is that this grant will provide hope to families with children with DIPG.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACRF Brainstorm Research Lab will use AI and other tools to test thousands of treatment options and determine the best course of action.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also fund a clean room to make personalised cell therapies for patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Misty Jenkins, the head of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, admits it's a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Prognosis for DIPG is the most dismal of any other cancer, and in fact, brain cancers kill more children than any other disease. And so the dial hasn't shifted for decades. And unfortunately oncologists are still having the same conversations with patients, which is telling them to go home and make memories with their families, and that there are no options available. And so we really need to start working together and collaborating better and really start to take more of a creative approach to tackling these really insidious, intractable diseases like brain cancer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brainstorm project will test new drugs as well as therapies for brain cancers, which they hope will speed up the process from discovering treatment options right through to clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an end to end pipeline, so it's going from the drug discovery using AI approaches and liquid handling robots for drug screening all the way through to laboratory based testing all the way through to our patients that are in the operating room, having their tumours removed, and then being able to sequence some quickly and diagnose quickly, and then using that information to inform our drug design.\"\n\n\n\n",

The United States, he said, was \"not doing too well\" before he took office, but now \"we're the hottest country anywhere in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Trump told reporters he did not care about the prize, but noted that he had \"settled eight wars\" in his 10 months in office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't need prizes. I need to save lives,\" Trump said. \"I saved millions and millions of lives, and that's really what I want to do.\"\n\n\n\nThe most logistically complex World Cup in history will be held across the United States, Mexico and Canada from 11 June to 19 July, with 16 more teams added to the global showpiece, up from the 32 nations involved in Qatar in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe draw was co-hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum and American actor and comedian Kevin Hart, and featured performances by the Village People, Robbie Williams and Andrea Bocelli.\n\n\n\n\n\nNFL legend Tom Brady, ice hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal were among the stars helping to conduct the draw.\n\n\n\nNFL legend Tom Brady, ice hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal were among the stars helping to conduct the draw.

And he would do that,\" Trump said recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nEleven of the 16 World Cup venues are in the United States, with three in Mexico and two in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Azteca Stadium in Mexico City will host the opening game and the final will take place at the MetLife Stadium outside New York City.\n\n\n\n",

Survey found that 54% of 18-to-34 year olds said that retail theft was justifiable to some degree.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics reported 270,000 retail thefts last year, a rise of 7 per cent on the previous year, and the highest in two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Atto says it\u2019s part of a broader shift in attitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" During an alarming crime rise, Australia is certainly more accepting of retail theft and our survey found that one in four believed it was justifiable to some degree to commit retail theft including taking an item and not paying for it. We do expect an increase in retail crime leading up to Christmas and we do say that retailers need to certainly be vigilant and also that police and law enforcement need to be out there looking after retailers as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, Victoria recorded the highest rise in all robberies, up by 16 per cent, followed by Tasmania with 11 per cent. Dr Vincent Hurley is a lecturer in criminology at Macquarie University, and a former police officer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" There's inflation, there's stagnation of their wages if they're working part time. So even to survive, they would consider stealing to be a way to survive in this cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to 93 per cent of consumers aged 55 years and older view shoplifting as \u2018not at all justifiable\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Hurley says self-checkouts that depersonalise payments, may be part of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They do not see stealing from an individual, from a person. They see the stealing from an organization, a corporation, which has no face, it has no identity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeventy per cent of shop owners report a rise in shoplifting over the past financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite retailers, police and peak bodies uniting to crack down on repeat offenders, Dr Hurley says the crime surge shows no signs of slowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" We should be worried about this trend as a society, absolutely! Low level crime can lead to much wider and more crime.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime Stoppers Victoria reports that nearly 70 per cent of retail theft in that state is committed by repeat offenders, many operating in well-organised networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one reason Harry Zhao fears fighting theft is a losing battle.\n\n\n\n",

FIFA is the official happiness provider of humanity,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what happened at the glitzy 2026 FIFA World Cup draw event:\n\n\n\nWho is in Australia's group?\n\nFormer Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand, along with broadcaster Samantha Johnson and sporting icons such as Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Aaron Judge, and Shaquille O'Neal, conducted the draw for 48 national teams, placing them in 12 different groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Neal drew Australia's name for group D, meaning the Socceroos will be playing against one of the hosts, the US (USMNT), and Paraguay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be the first time Australia is facing the host nation since 1974 in Germany.\n\n\n\nNFL legend Tom Brady, ice hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal were among the stars helping to conduct the draw.

The Socceroos have played the US four times, for one win, one draw and two losses.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Fox, the USMNT manager, Mauricio Pochettino, pointed out their previous clash against Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to respect all the opponents.

Since the Socceroos are in the group with one of the hosts, their games are likely to be scheduled on North America's west coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Socceroos' opponent for the first match is still unknown, as the national team will play their first match against the winner of playoff C between Slovakia, Kosovo, or Turkiye, on 13 June in Vancouver.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 19 June, Australia will be facing the hosts, United States, in Seattle, probably for their most important match in the group stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSix days later, for their last match, Australia will face Paraguay in Santa Clara.\n\n\n\nWhat if the Socceroos qualify?\n\nBased on the new World Cup rules, the top two teams from each of the 12 groups will qualify to the next stage, along with the eight best third-placed teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Socceroos win group D, they will face the best third-placed team from groups A, B, C, D or F, and if they get second, they have to play against the runners-up of group G, one of Egypt, Iran or New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinishing one of the eight best third-placers will also mean that the Socceroos will face the Group E, I, or K winner.\n\n\n\nFull group draw revealed\n\nGroup A: Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Play-off D winner (Czechia, Ireland, Denmark or Macedonia\n\nGroup B: Canada, Play-off A winner (Wales, Bosnia and Herzegovinam, Italy or Northern Ireland), Qatar, Switzerland,\n\nGroup C: Brazil, Morocco, Haiti, Scotland\n\nGroup D: The US, Paraguay, Australia, Play-off C winner (Slovakia, Kosovo, Turkiye or Romania)\n\nGroup E: Germany, Cura\u00e7ao, Ivory Coast, Ecuador\n\nGroup F: Netherlands, Japan, Play-off B winner (Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania) Tunisia\n\nGroup G: Belgium, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand\n\nGroup H: Spain, Cabo Verde, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay\n\nGroup I: France, Senegal, Play-off 2 winner (Bolivia, Suriname or Iraq), Norway\n\nGroup J: Argentina, Algeria, Austria, Jordan\n\nGroup K: Portugal, Play-off 1 winner (New Caledonia, Jamaica or Democratic Republic of the Congo), Uzbekistan, Colombia\n\nGroup L: England, Croatia, Ghana, Panama\n\nWhich is 'the group of death'?\n\nIt looks like for 2026, it will be hard to pick 'the group of death'.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Group I (France, Senegal, playoff 2 winner \u2014Bolivia, Suriname or Iraq \u2014 and Norway) can be one to watch, as the French superstar Kylian Mbappe, will be facing the Norwegian goal scorer Erling Haaland.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup L (England, Croatia, Ghana and Panama) is another one to watch, as England might be looking for revenge from Croatia, who beat them in the 2018 World Cup semifinal, bringing their World Cup streak to an end at that time\n\n\n\nTrump winning the controversial '2025 FIFA peace prize'\n\nThe event, however, was not just about football, as Infantino presented the inaugural FIFA peace prize to the US President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfantino said the award is presented by \"billions of football lovers\", and they gave the award to Trump for his \"actions to provide peace around the world\".\n\n\n\n\n\nInfantino said: \"This is what we want from a leader, a leader that cares about the people.

This musical accent honoured Tommie Andersson, the orchestra\u2019s foundation theorbo and baroque guitar principal, who is making his final appearances with the ABO this tour after delighting audiences for nearly 40 years. This year\u2019s edition of the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra\u2019s Christmas offering took on a Spanish flavour. Credit: Laura Manariti Under the irrepressibly energetic direction of Paul Dyer, the orchestra and Brandenburg Choir were joined by guest artists Argentinian mezzo-soprano Maria Eugenia Nieva and Australian classical guitarist Andrew Blanch. Wearing a full-length bright red dress with a side slit, Nieva exuded plenty of Latin sensuality. Her strong, dark-chocolate mezzo voice animated a variety of numbers from the traditional carol Ri\u00fa Ri\u00fa Chi\u00fa, through Gioia & Amore by Spanish renaissance composer Soto de Langa and Nana from Six Popular Spanish Songs by Manuel de Falla to Santa la noche, an arrangement of Adolphe Adam\u2019s beloved classic O Holy Night.\n\nBlanch, who featured prominently in the program, was especially brilliant in Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s Leyenda, arranged to showcase the simmering passion of the guitar\u2019s rapid-fire flamenco technique. Once again, the Brandenburg Choir brought sheer delight to the choral aspect of No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! with crisp ensemble and crystalline diction. Between the customary bookends, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, and O Come, All ye Faithful, came some English schmaltz courtesy of John Rutter and Philip Stopford, as well as an intense account of the Kyrie from Palestrina\u2019s Missa Papae Marcelli. In chamber formation, the Brandenburgs themselves were in top form, bringing joyous dynamism to Monn\u2019s Sinfonia in G and whimsy to an arrangement of God Rest ye Merry, Gentlemen. Andersson\u2019s own solos and his poignant accompaniment of Stille Nacht (Silent Night) with its original Austrian lilt mirrored his quiet but impressive dedication. No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl! continues to be a distinctive but deservedly popular Christmas tradition.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nParcels: LOVED Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSidney Myer Music Bowl, December 4 I dare you to stand still at a Parcels show. From the minute they hit the stage, the band\u2019s blend of electro-pop and disco-pop rhythms has the crowd possessed, grooving along to the psychedelic funky beat. The Australian five-piece indie band were formed in Byron Bay in 2014, and make the spontaneous move to Berlin that year. They have played some high-profile gigs in 2025, including Coachella and Glastonbury. This weekend, their national tour concludes in Sydney with two gigs on the steps of the Opera House. It\u2019s hard to stand still at a Parcels show. Credit: \u00a9Martin Philbey The band experiments with many different sounds across the set. Opening with Tobeloved, they show off their signature harmonies, reminiscent of The Beach Boys. It\u2019s clear how Berlin Club culture has influenced their music when they perform Gamesofluck, the stage lit with an electric blue as the keys and guitar pulse. They performed Overnight, a single co-produced and co-written with Daft Punk after they attended Parcel\u2019s first-ever show in Paris in 2016; the duo\u2019s electronic influence is evident in the live sound.\n\nFinallyover, their final song, has a much more mellow, retro rock feel like The Beatles. They perform a lengthy instrumental track, which feels improvised, exerting riffs that resemble the disco energy of Boney M and AC/DC\u2019s ultra-rock Thunderstruck. Parcels in full flight. Credit: \u00a9Martin Philbey \u201cI know we are a lot of people, but we move as one tonight,\u201d says one of the band, indistinguishable in the moody lighting, and that collective feeling carries through, maintaining a chill vibe across the entire set. During Summerinlove, the crowd leans into the sexiness with footage of couples kissing in the front row projected onto a heart-shaped kiss cam on the screen above. It\u2019s clear the band are having just as much fun as the crowd. Patrick Hetherington\u2019s foot pounds the stage as Jules Crommelin\u2019s hips thrust against his guitar and Noah Hill\u2019s neck jerks back and forth like a chicken. The band seemed to have as much fun as their energetic audience. Credit: \u00a9Martin Philbey\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of euphoria that fills the atmosphere at the all-ages concert. Like a rave, the infectious beats travel through your ears and all the way to your feet. The band asks tech staff to light up the crowd, as they peer into the masses extending up the theatre and across the green of the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. As Crommelin perches at the end of the stage, he says: \u201cJust going to take a second to take this all in.\u201d What a start to the summer.\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar THEATRE\n\nSoul of Possum \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until December 13 A few months ago, after nearly 10 years of consultation, parliament passed Treaty legislation for Aboriginal Victorians. It\u2019s the first treaty of its kind in Australia and one that not only acknowledges past injustices but also commits to returning decision-making powers to Aboriginal communities. Presented within this context, this latest staging of Soul of Possum serves as a potent and topical reminder of the past that still needs present reckoning. Soul of Possum is based on the experiences of the playwright\u2019s ancestors. Credit: Darren Gill\n\nBased on the personal histories of playwright Brodie Murray\u2019s ancestors (in particular his father and grandfather), the play is a taut reenactment of an altercation between colonial soldiers and members of an Indigenous population on the Murray River in Swan Hill. With a few cast changes, Soul of Possum\u2019s latest iteration follows on from a successful season at Castlemaine State Festival and Yirramboi Festival in 2021. It\u2019s 1853, in Wamba Wamba Country and Marnuu (Balla Neba) is troubled by his dreams; the voice of Possum predicts wide-scale destruction by a hostile force, a devastation of both people and wildlife. But his fellow warriors Gundi (Wimiya Woodley) and Barru (Murray) are sceptical and mock his warnings. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a steamboat moored at the river, with a military expedition about to disembark to open up the country for \u201cglorious empire\u201d. It\u2019s a story most of us should know; this first contact skirmish between two parties who are completely alien to the other\u2019s customs and cultures, and the resulting and continuing legacy of settler-occupation. The play asks us to imagine what it was actually like in the initial round of invasion and resistance, a pattern that would repeat itself across the land. The play is a taut renactment of an altercation between colonial soldiers and members of an Indigenous population on the Murray River in Swan Hill. Credit: Darren Gill\n\nThe stage is sparse except for a large projection of the riverbank at the back, two platforms on the left that serve as the steamboat and a clump of river reeds, a tree, and a campfire to the right. Preview night brought some rushed dialogue from the trio of warriors that should hopefully settle for the rest of the season. Maybe they feel there\u2019s no time to waste: under Beng Oh\u2019s direction, the 70-minute narrative moves fast, with the plight of both sets of white and blackfellas played out in alternate scenes before they finally meet. Loading What makes Soul of Possum interesting is that it dramatises the internecine in-fighting among each group. The First Nations Australians lose valuable time arguing about what to do with the threat of territorial trespass while the English marauders - Captain Gibbons (Leigh Scully), Lieutenant Bankes (Gabriel Partington), Dr Wilkins (Kevin Dee) and Irish convict Yates (Luke Mason) have their own on-board power conflicts to contend with. All four characters are performed with ease and conviction. There\u2019s an earnestness about this play and some unnecessary repetition in the script. The ending that brings us back to the present day also seems a bit too expository after everything that we\u2019ve witnessed before. Nonetheless, Soul of Possum does manage to take us into the crossfire of colonial violence in its short, sharp stage time.\n\nReviewed by Thuy On\n\nSoul of Possum was reviewed from a preview performance",

    "text": "\u201cAnika Wells was working on that trip as sports minister, participating in the lifting up of parasport. That\u2019s been driven by Anika Wells,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are rules there, and I\u2019m not going to go through each and every one. I\u2019ve got a big job, David [Insiders host David Speers]. It\u2019s completely within the rules. \u201cThere\u2019s family reunion entitlements \u2013 all the travel that\u2019s within the guidelines. She was working and there were announcements and there were events there.\u201d Wells is also under pressure over her use of taxpayer entitlements to attend a friend\u2019s birthday party in Adelaide, the sky-high cost of flights to New York for meetings at the United Nations and her use of expenses on trips to France undertaken as Sports minister. Wells faces multiple expenses questions\n\nSports and Communications Minister Anika Wells has been under pressure to justify travel expenses. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Wells has been under fire since Wednesday after revelations she charged taxpayers more than $100,000 for flights to New York to showcase Australia\u2019s social media ban. Loading This was swiftly followed by reports she had used her travel entitlements for trips to Adelaide, where she attended a friend\u2019s birthday party, and three trips to France in one year in her role as sports minister to attend the Rugby World Cup and the Olympics. The furore over Wells\u2019 use of expenses has overshadowed the minister\u2019s attempts to promote new laws that restrict under 16s\u2019 use of social media, which come into effect this Wednesday.\n\nIndependent Parliamentary Expenses Authority figures show the minister claimed $844 of taxpayer-funded travel allowance to stay at a resort in Thredbo over the two nights, and then claimed another $318 to stay in Canberra on Sunday night citing \u201cparliamentary duties\u201d. Her flights from Brisbane to Canberra, the nearest major airport to the Thredbo resort, cost taxpayers another $294.32. Wells was accompanied by her husband, Finn McCarthy, and two of her three children under \u201cfamily reunion\u201d rules that allow MPs to reunite with their families when travelling for work. Taxpayers spent another $1389.18 on flights so her family could join her for the weekend at the snow, with Wells\u2019 husband posting pictures of their children on the skiing trip a couple of days later on social media. All told, the two-day trip to the ski fields cost taxpayers $2845.50, but a government spokesman defended the minister\u2019s use of travel and entitlements, saying \u201cthe travel was in accordance with the guidelines\u201d.\n\nBut Wells\u2019 use of the family reunion rules is strikingly similar to a trip the current Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke took to Uluru back in April 2012, when he was the environment minister, and claimed $12,000 in allowances and flights so his family could join him on that trip. Details of Burke\u2019s trip emerged in 2015, soon after the Bronwyn Bishop \u201cchoppergate\u201d scandal. At the time, Burke insisted, like Wells, that he had not breached the rules but he did admit the trip was \u201cbeyond community expectations\u201d of what MPs should be claiming in taxpayer-funded expenses. Burke repaid $8656.48 of that trip \u2013 the cost of four airfares \u2013 five years later, in 2020. There is no suggestion that Wells contravened the rules on the trip to Thredbo because of her official engagements, but the expenses claims raise fresh questions about her use of entitlements and whether they are in line with \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers was asked last week on the ABC\u2019s 730 program if Wells\u2019 trip to New York passed the pub test, and argued: \u201cThat\u2019s for others to judge. But from my point of view, it\u2019s official travel. It\u2019s well within the guidelines.\u201d The rules for what expenses and allowances ministers can claim are governed by the Department of Finance\u2019s \u201cdominant purpose\u201d test. Loading That test states that expense claims can be made for one of four reasons \u2013 when an MP or minister is undertaking parliamentary duties, electorate duties, party political duties or official duties. On its website, the department states that \u201cthe dominant purpose test asks whether you would have undertaken the activity or incurred or claimed the expense, allowance or other public resource but for your parliamentary business\u201d.\n\nThe rules on reunions allow family members to travel from their home base to Canberra, with a maximum annual cost limit set as the equivalent value of nine business-class return airfares to Canberra for an MP\u2019s partner, plus three economy-class return airfares to Canberra for each dependent child. Parliament\u2019s Senate estimates committee heard last week that Wells, a staffer and a public servant had spent almost $100,000 on flights to attend the United Nations General Assembly and another $70,000 to host an event that spruiked the government\u2019s teen social media ban earlier this year. After a difficult appearance at the National Press Club last week during which Wells avoided directly answering questions about her New York trip, The Australian Financial Review then revealed the under-pressure minister took a three-day taxpayer-funded $3600 trip in June to Adelaide. During that trip, Wells attended a friend\u2019s birthday party as well as official meetings with state ministers.",

We rank Brisbane\u2019s largest from one to five. Matt Shea December 7, 2025 Save You have reached your maximum number of saved items. Remove items from your saved list to add more.

Or, if it still exists, it\u2019s at least usually complemented by some quality alternative eateries, maybe in one of those la-di-da outdoor dining precincts with a playground, a water feature and those cool timber lounge chairs. Westfield Chermside in Brisbane\u2019s north. Jamila Toderas But not all shopping centres are equal \u2013 particularly the big dogs: your Garden Cities, Indooroopillys and Chermsides \u2013 which is odd when so much else of the experience tends to be pretty consistent. Which is best? We wanted to find out, so over the past 12 months or so, we\u2019ve spent more time than we probably should hanging around the city\u2019s biggest suburban shopping centres to trial their eateries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Monster 800-seat brewpub touches down near Brisbane Airport Before you ask: no, food-angled shopping centres like Market Square, Sunny Park et al. don\u2019t count, nor does the CBD. This is the big suburban retail centres with a few anchor tenants like Myer or David Jones. We found you can get something half decent to eat at all these places. Still, there was one clear winner. 5. Westfield Carindale What are you doing, Carindale? This stalwart in the city\u2019s south-east is a good shopping experience as far as malls go, but its food options lag the centres further up this list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re not going to go hungry at Westfield Carindale, but it lags some of the other centres around town. Tammy Law You\u2019re never going to eat poorly here, but it\u2019s dominated by what I call \u201castroturfers\u201d \u2013 the chains that have picked up on a trending cuisine and done a certainly passable, very replicable, but not particularly exciting take on it: think Grill\u2019d for burgers, Roll\u2019d for Vietnamese, or Guzman y Gomez for Mexican. But it is getting better. Yes, David\u2019s Noodle & Hotpot is a chain, but it does very good malatang. There\u2019s Foster & Black and Cafe Halo for coffee, or Gong Cha for bubble tea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s also a Cinnabon, which hit Australia like a hurricane a couple of years back with cinnamon scrolls that are legitimately better than most independents. Cinnabon\u2019s tightly spiralled buns. So, a pass mark, I guess. But there are better options in Brisbane when you want to shop and feed. 4. Indooroopilly Shopping Centre Despite its fancy expansion in 2014, which added high-end retailers such as Scanlan Theodore, Aquila and Zimmermann, Indooroopilly Shopping Centre\u2019s eating options remained pretty underwhelming for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndooroopilly lagged behind other shopping centres for dining, but it\u2019s getting better. But it was the first centre outside Sunnybank to get a Hakataya Ramen, and from there, it\u2019s slowly become better and better. Motto Motto, from Sonos owner William Liu, is always worth a shout (it has an outlet in a lot of shopping malls around the south-east) for fast-paced Japanese. And the centre over-represents on specialty coffee, with both Foster & Black and Archer present and correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gold, though, is on the ground floor, where there\u2019s a Cinnabon and a David\u2019s Noodle & Hot Pot. Also, check out The Butcher\u2019s Grill: little more than a grill-and-counter setup attached to Andrew\u2019s Meats, its classic Angus beef burger \u2013 basically, a gussied up take on an old-school Australian barbecue burger (refreshing, in the face of the American-style onslaught) \u2013 has gone up in price recently, but is still one of the better value burgs around town. 3. Westfield North Lakes If you tend to breeze through Westfield North Lakes just to get to Ikea, you\u2019re missing out, because the centre boasts a stack of good food options.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, there\u2019s a TGI Fridays and an El Camino Cantina, and a whole lot of other phone-it-ins, but there are also a bunch of delicious alternatives: see Lanzhou Beef Noodle for hand-pulled Chinese noodle soup, Kinn for fast-paced, fragrant and wallet-friendly Thai, and Chicken Park for fried bird. There\u2019s also Smiling Dumplings and Noodles for, yep, dumplings and noodles, Bapboi for Korean barbecue, and the family run Ka-Chow Asian Kitchen for pan-south-east Asian. No need to resort to Swedish meatballs here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Westfield Chermside Now we\u2019re getting serious. Chermside is the third-largest shopping mall in Australia and, since the addition of its outdoor dining precinct in 2017, has bulked up its food options to match. Westfield Chermside\u2019s sunny outdoor dining precinct. There\u2019s a bunch of good options here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTry Momo for crisply fried Korean chicken, Kinn+Derm for legit Thai, and Hanok for Korean barbecue. Also, Simone Presta and Carmine Guarino recently opened a second instalment of their terrific fast-paced Italian eatery Scugnizzi. Scugnizzi serves quality fast-paced Italian. Morgan Roberts Elsewhere, there\u2019s Archer, Foster & Black and Be Kalii for coffee; Yo-Bar for self-serve frozen yoghurt and acai; Hakataya for ramen; NYC Bagel Deli for stacked bagels; and David\u2019s Noodle & Hotpot for malatang. That\u2019s just a taste of the independents (and smaller, quality chains), and then you have the big-box operators and fast food spots on top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaken altogether, it\u2019s well pitched and impressive in its ambition and utility, particularly when you consider Chermside probably didn\u2019t have to do this \u2013 it\u2019s not like the surrounding suburb heaves with restaurants and cafes. 1. Westfield Mt Gravatt Will any Brisbane shopping centre ever top Garden City for food? Probably not. And will anyone ever stop calling it Garden City? Again, probably not. Westfield Mount Gravatt (aka Garden City) is the clear winner when it comes to shopping centre food. Tammy Law\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis huge shopping mall \u2013 the eighth-largest in the country \u2013 is the solar plexus of Brisbane\u2019s multicultural southern suburbs, and that\u2019s reflected in the giddy breadth of its food options. It was already reasonably good before the centre opened its outside dining precinct in 2014. Then, on top of that, there\u2019s the 8 Street Asian food precinct downstairs, plus a bunch of good spots scattered in between. Where to start? The atrium at the top of the escalators at the north-western end of the centre is as good as any. Here, your Oportos, McDonalds and KFCs sit alongside operators such as 1919 Lanzhou Beef Noodle, with its unctuous, spicy bowls of hand-pulled Chinese noods; New Shanghai and its lengthy menu of house-made dim sum; and Hokkaido, with its perfectly flaked baked cheese tarts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWander down one of the halls to the outside dining precinct and you could eat at Betty\u2019s, Vapiano or Nando\u2019s, or get classy yum cha at Yum Cha Cuisine, killer Malaysian (including one of the best char kway teows in town) at Ya Hoo Kitchen, or well-pitched sushi at Sushi Edo. Hokkaido\u2019s famous cheese tarts. And then there\u2019s 8 Street, a charming facsimile of the kind of food alley you might find in Bangkok or Hong Kong. Here, there\u2019s a bunch of hole-in-the-wall vendors serving malatang, chongqing noodles, ramen, bibimbap and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScattered about other parts of the centre are a Hakataya Ramen, a Foster & Black and a David\u2019s Master Pot malatang joint. If you need to eat while you shop, Garden City is the spot.\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

(Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"People can have an opinion about whether it was worth the money,\" Ms Wells told Sky News on Sunday.\n\n\"But for me, the policy imperative that the life-changing work that we are trying to do ... it was really important and I stand by it.\"\n\nMr Albanese defended the spending as within the guidelines and said the New York trip to promote the social media ban, which will come into effect on Wednesday, was \"very significant\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"This was an important event that led directly to the European Union taking action,\" he told ABC's Insiders on Sunday.\n\n\"One of the comments I heard from various UN officials was ... 'this is the first time I've been to a forum that has changed my mind'.\"\n\nMs Wells, who is also the sports minister, reportedly took three trips to Paris in 12 months at a cost of $116,000, to attend major sporting events including the Rugby World Cup, Paris Olympics and Paris Paralympics.\n\n\"People can have an opinion about whether it was worth the money,\" Anika Wells says of her US trip. (Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nShe was authorised to spend $6000 on meals for five days, with one dinner reportedly billed for $600.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"I recall sometimes I was eating a muesli bar in the car. These are big days,\" Ms Wells said.\n\n\"I appreciate it looks a certain way because it's Paris, but that is where the Games were.\"\n\nOpposition industry spokesman Alex Hawke said the spending did not pass the pub test, adding the expenses were so high they would \"make the royals blush\".\n\n\"It simply doesn't stack up and the minister's defences don't seem to stack up either,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"If the minister is eating a muesli bar ... then why is the taxpayer being charged for expensive dinners ... if she's not partaking of them.\"\n\nAlex Hawke says Ms Wells' expenses were so high they would \"make the royals blush\".
