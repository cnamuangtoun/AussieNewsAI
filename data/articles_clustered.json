    "text": "Marijuana may damage oocytes \u2014 unfertilised eggs in female ovaries \u2014 in ways researchers worry may lead to infertility, miscarriage and possible genetic defects in babies , new research has found.\n\nHigher levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 a chemical in marijuana that produces a euphoric feeling or \"high\" \u2014 was linked with changes in how eggs mature and a possible increase in chromosome malformations, according to the study published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\n\"The findings of this study are concerning and highlight the importance of a cautious approach in using cannabis when planning to conceive,\" obstetrician Dr Jamie Lo, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynaecology and urology in the School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, said in an email. She was not involved with the study.\n\nBelieving marijuana to be safe, an increasing number of women turn to weed to handle nausea and other pregnancy complications, experts say. (juanmahache/Moment RF/Getty Images)\n\nUse of marijuana during pregnancy is rising.\n\nA June study found past-month self-reported cannabis use has more than tripled among pregnant women in the US from 2002 to 2020.\n\nNumerous studies have linked marijuana use during pregnancy to autism, poor fetal development, low infant birth weight, dangerously early deliveries and even death.\n\nThe new study is \"an exciting and novel approach to address a key gap in knowledge,\" Lo, who studies marijuana and fertility, said.\n\nA number of studies have looked at how marijuana might affect sperm, but until now no study had looked at the impact of marijuana on the human egg and ovarian follicle, she said.\n\nA follicle is a small, fluid-filled sac in the ovary that contains one unfertilised egg.\n\nDuring a woman's menstrual cycle, hormones kick off a chain of events that help the oocyte segregate chromosomes so it will be ready for fertilisation by sperm.\n\nHigher levels of THC appeared to impact this process, said lead study author Cyntia Duval, who conducted the study while a postdoctoral research fellow in ovarian biology at the University of Toronto.\n\nHowever, the study can only show an association and not a direct cause and effect, said Duval, who now directs applied research at CReATe Fertility Centre, a fertility clinic in Toronto, Canada.\n\nCReATe stands for Canadian Reproductive Assisted Technology.\n\n\"This is a hypothesis, and the worst thing I would want is for the public to read this and become fearful,\" she said.\n\n\"More studies are needed to verify our findings and determine how or even if the changes we observed affect reproduction.\"\n\nHigher levels of THC most harmful\n\nResearchers analysed over 1000 ovarian fluid samples from patients undergoing infertility treatment.\n\nOocytes from a smaller group of 62 patients who tested positive for THC were compared with a matched control group with no detectable use of cannabis.\n\nCompared with the control group, the group of patients with detectable levels of THC was associated with an increased oocyte maturation rate and a lower number of embryos with the correct number of chromosomes, the study team found.\n\nOn first glance, a higher maturation rate may appear to be positive, but developing too quickly can create problems with how oocytes prepare for reproduction, Duval said.\n\n\"Chromosomes need time to align perfectly to be ready to be fertilised by sperm and create healthy embryos,\" she said.\n\n\"So yes, we have more oocytes that are mature, but at what price if they don't have the right number of chromosomes?\"\n\nREAD MORE: Swedish health minister collapses during media conference\n\nMarijuana is becoming legal in more parts of the world, seeing its use increase. (AP)\n\nAnother part of the study examined extremely immature oocytes in vitro, which means in a test tube in the lab.\n\nThe oocytes were donated by women undergoing fertility treatment and were not suitable for use, Duval said.\n\nWhen exposed to THC for 24 hours in a petri dish, immature oocytes receiving higher levels of THC had more altered spindles \u2014 the structures that help chromosomes to segregate properly \u2014 which can lead to failures in embryonic development.\n\n\"The finding that exposure to higher levels of THC could be associated with worsened fertility and increased reproductive complications may help patients that cannot abstain from cannabis with a harm-reduction strategy,\" Lo said.\n\n\"With this information, these patients can consider reducing the amount of cannabis that they are using to mitigate adverse outcomes to their babies.\"\n\nThe potency of THC is not always obvious\n\nThe potency of THC quadrupled between 1995 and 2022 and is now even higher, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\"Cannabis flower and concentrates in dispensaries can have THC concentrations of more than 40 per cent.\n\nHigher THC concentrations have been associated with a greater likelihood of cannabis use progressing to cannabis use disorder, among other health concerns,\" the Institute states on its website.\n\nThis dangerous rise in potency may not be clear to consumers, experts fear. Looking at a product label might tell a person the \"precise potency\" of THC in a store where marijuana is legally sold.\n\nBut \"people buying cannabis illegally may not be able to access reliable information about the potency of the product they are using,\" researcher Tom Freeman, a professor of psychology at the University of Bath, told CNN in a prior interview.\n\nHe was not involved in the study.\n\nThe group of patients with detectable levels of THC was associated with an increased oocyte maturation rate and a lower number of embryos with the correct number of chromosomes (Getty)\n\n\"However, certain types of cannabis are typically more potent than others \u2014 cannabis extracts are typically more potent than cannabis flower,\" Freeman, director of the Addiction and Mental Health Group at the university in the United Kingdom, said.\n\nWhile people do try to adjust their consumption when the potency of their cannabis varies, \"such as by adding less cannabis to their joint or inhaling less deeply,\" these efforts fail to completely work, he added.\n\nThat means \"higher potency products still deliver a larger dose of THC to consumers than lower potency products,\" Freeman said.\n\nWomen may unknowingly harm the success of their future pregnancy by being exposed to higher THC levels than they intended, Lo said.\n\n\"Because it's hard to know the specific level of THC in various cannabis products on the shelves, I advise my patients to consider safer alternatives to treat the symptoms they're using cannabis for or at least try to reduce the frequency of their use.\"",

An \"epic fail?\" Or a roadworks accident?\n\nA photo of a road cone asphalted into a New Zealand footpath in New Plymouth, on the west coast of the North Island, has drawn derision on a Facebook community page, with one comment describing it as an \"epic fail\".\n\n\"OMG surely someone taking the piss,\" wrote another poster.\n\nYes, it's a road cone asphalted into the footpath, deliberately, by the council. (Stuff)\n\n\"Some drunk person is gonna try to kick that,\" said another.\n\nYet another suggested it could be art that becomes a local landmark.\n\nMelanie, who posted the photo, said she used the road daily.\n\nShe found the \"bizarre\" and she wasn't alone - screenshots of the post are doing the rounds on social media.\n\nHowever, a New Plymouth District Council spokesperson said the cone was simply protecting an exposed pipe.\n\nThe pipe connects a water main to an adjacent house, and was left uncovered while crews installed a new main, he said.\n\nA temporary asphalt patch was laid over the path as a safety measure, securing the cone in place over the pipe. Later this year, the connection will be finished and a permanent surface put down.\n\nThe council had not fielded any complaints over the cone, the spokesperson said.\n\nRoad cones have been in the spotlight this year, with the Government announcing a crackdown on their use.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon said there were \"hundreds of them doing very, very little\", and his deputy, David Seymour, complained about too many \"frickin' cones\".\n\nEven Transport Minister Chris Bishop calls their deployment \"overzealous\".\n\nTo tackle the tide of road cones, the Government launched a hotline for concerns about their use earlier this year. RNZ reported 650 reports in the hotline's first month of use. In Wellington, there were 115 complaints in two months.",

    "text": "Penrith's premiership dynasty has many fathers, but if it's to continue it will have to strike one of them down when it takes on James Fisher-Harris and the Warriors on Saturday night.\n\nAs wounded as the Kiwi club may be after an indifferent run into the finals, Fisher-Harris is sure to have them breathing fire in front of a frenzied Auckland crowd as both sides' seasons go on the line.\n\nFisher-Harris's ruthlessness as a competitor, his relentless intensity, his utter lack of mercy, and his ongoing refusal to consider the concepts of fatigue or pain are all important parts of the foundations on which the Panthers built their greatness.\n\nFisher-Harris led from the front for each of Penrith's four premiership wins. (Getty Images: Mark Kolbe)\n\nNow those same qualities are fixed on Penrith's demise in a high-stakes match for the first time, and one of the creators of the greatest winning run of modern times is aiming to destroy what he helped forge.\n\nSo Penrith know exactly what to expect, and it's not so much they'll leave their history with Fisher-Harris on the Mt Smart Stadium sideline, even if a knockout semifinal is hardly the time to get sentimental.\n\nThey'll take the memories out there with them and show the Kiwi prop the respect he demands, the only way they know how.\n\nFisher-Harris is one of the most decorated players of Penrith's dynasty. (Getty Images: Matt Blyth )\n\n\"I'll definitely go at him. Fish knows I love the challenge, but I always give respect to my uncle, I can't wait to go up against him,\" said winger Brian To'o.\n\n\"You always fight with your brothers; it brings the best out of you.\n\n\"It goes both ways, we want to bring the best out of each other, and that only happens when you go 110 per cent at each other.\n\n\"It's always been like that, everyone who's here and everyone who's left knows the go.\"\n\nThat means Fisher-Harris is certain to respond in kind. He still doesn't say much, but this is a serious business, and he never wants to play teams who muck around.\n\nFisher-Harris is the kind of player who forgot how to take a backward step so long ago it might be more accurate to say he never learned.\n\nHis journey to Penrith over a decade ago is the stuff of legend. Raised in the town of Kohukohu in New Zealand \u2014 which has a population of about 300 \u2014 Fisher-Harris was playing first-grade rugby alongside his father at 15.\n\nWhen he first came to Sydney, he packed one bag. He didn't know how to catch a train or a bus and lived in apartments above a horse stable.\n\nFisher-Harris helped drive much of Penrith's success over the past four seasons. (Getty Images: Brendon Thorne)\n\nHe was one of the first of the future Penrith legends to come through the grades \u2014 Isaah Yeo is the only one of the homegrown Panthers who debuted before him, and the two of them are the only players of their generation to play more than 200 games for the club.\n\nBy the time To'o was rising through the ranks, Fisher-Harris was already a focal point for the side, even if they and he were far from what they would become.\n\nFisher-Harris' status as an elite prop predates the premierships \u2014 his first truly great season came in 2019, the same year To'o debuted, but he'd been someone for the blockbusting winger to look to well before that.\n\n\"I was still in Under 20s, he was training in grade. He came up to me, shook my hand, asked me how training and everything was going,\" To'o said.\n\n\"It was a lot of words for him to say at once. He was very softly spoken then, but his actions spoke for themselves.\n\n\"He's been a role model figure for me, I always appreciated that, and I'll never forget it.\"\n\nCleary and Luai set for first meeting as NRL foes Photo shows Two men celebrate with the NRL premiership trophy Nathan Cleary and Jarome Luai drove Penrith to unfathomable heights together but now the two will face off in the NRL for the first time with both their seasons at a crossroads.\n\nNow, the Panthers are filled with players who came up under the high standards Fisher-Harris helped inspire, and Lindsay Smith, who replaced him as one of the starting props this year, is chief among them.\n\n\"There was probably a year or two there where I didn't say too much to him, I was too scared,\" Smith said.\n\n\"I learned a lot from him over the years. He's a big part of why I'm an NRL player and why I'm here today.\"\n\nEven though he left over the summer for the Warriors after securing a release on compassionate grounds, Fisher-Harris is still showing the way for the Panthers.\n\nDue to COVID and quirks of the NRL draw, Penrith has only played in New Zealand once since 2019.\n\nThat game came back in June when the Panthers downed the Warriors 28-18 despite resting their contingent of State of Origin players.\n\nAs was the case when they played Jarome Luai at Wests Tigers or Stephen Crichton at Canterbury, the prospect of taking on someone who helped build the empire brought out the best in Penrith, especially for prop Moses Leota, one of Fisher-Harris's best friends, who enjoyed his best game of the season.\n\nAt the time, the Panthers were stuck in 11th place on the ladder and were only two matches removed from the bottom of the ladder, but the win felt like the start of something.\n\n\"That was a turning point in our year,\" Smith said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"We'd strung two wins together, but to go over there and win without any of the Origin boys was pretty special.\"\n\nThat victory was the third in what turned out to be a nine-match winning streak that brought Penrith's season back from the dead as they reacquainted themselves with their famed blood and bone style that Fisher-Harris once helped define.\n\nAs Penrith got back to the old ways, it kept its chances at a fifth straight title alive.\n\nTo do so, they'll have to become just the third team in 117 years of Australian rugby league to win the competition from outside the top four, and even if they're favourites to win on Saturday, the odds are against them like never before.\n\nBut according to To'o, the difficulties that lie ahead, both in Auckland and potentially beyond, are exactly what the Panthers need if they're to create yet more history.\n\n\"We're taking the long road, so it is something different,\" To'o said.\n\n\"All these challenges we face, it brings the best out of us.\n\n\"Not playing there in so long, since 2019, it's another challenge for us and we're keen for it.\"",

I think there's a bunch of players around my age, sort of looking to push to that sort of Super Rugby level, like one day, and obviously Wallabies after that,\" he told ABC Sport.\n\n\"[It is] just a great opportunity to get to play at a high level and mesh with people who are seasoned players and have done it at the highest level, which I think will force us to rise and then hopefully go from there.\"\n\nMartens, 20, is a scrumhalf who showed off quick thinking and vision during Queensland's match against Tonga last month.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nA stand-out this season for the GPS club in Brisbane's Premier Grade competition, Martens is expected to come off the bench for the Reds this Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to ABC Sport, he said the exposure of professional set-ups and the opportunity to continue playing against high-level competition at the end of the club season was an exciting proposition for young players striving to break into Super Rugby.\n\n\"The more footy you play, the better you get, and the more footy at a higher level, as well, definitely helps,\" he said.\n\n\"The exposure that we get from this, and hopefully the time that we'll be able to get on the field with the people around us, will just help improve us so much faster.\"\n\nSuper Rugby AUS also gives those on the cusp of Wallabies selection a chance to shine and be noticed for Test matches at the end of the season.\n\nMassimo De Lutiis, 21, was a surprise selection in Joe Schmidt's January squad despite not having made his Super Rugby Pacific debut.\n\nMassimo De Lutiis wants to use Super Rugby AUS as a platform to break into future Wallabies' squads. (AAP: Darren England)\n\nThe Reds' prop forward went on to play nine matches for the Reds in 2025 before suffering a fractured wrist in May.\n\nThe young tighthead, who played alongside current Wallabies Tom Hooper, Tom Lynagh and Corey Toole for Australia A last year, said Super Rugby AUS was an opportunity for him to get back in contention for international consideration.\n\n\"For this Super Rugby AUS, we made a rule that we're just going to compete with each other, like, we're not going to go easy on each other no matter what. We're competing for that first spot,\" he told media on Wednesday.\n\n\"Obviously [playing for the] Wallabies is on the radar, and these are the games to prove myself. I'm going to be putting my hat in the ring for that.\n\n\"The more rugby, the better, that's all I can say. I think all the boys are keen. I know every other state's going to be keen to go.\"\n\nSuper Rugby AUS round one\n\nFriday, September 12\n\nNSW Waratahs vs Western Force, 7:30pm, Warringah Rugby Club, Warriewood, Sydney\n\nSunday, September 14\n\nQueensland Reds vs ACT Brumbies, 3pm, Ballymore Stadium, Herston, Brisbane",

    "text": "The Department of Defence has quietly axed a procurement process with Thales Australia that promised to scale up production at the company's Benalla munitions facility in north-east Victoria.\n\nUnder the deal, Thales was set to manufacture 155-millimetre M795 artillery ammunition.\n\nAt a National Press Club address last year, Minister for Defence Industry Pat Conroy said the Benalla factory would be the \"first dedicated facility outside the United States to manufacture this artillery round\".\n\nPat Conroy announced the deal at the National Press Club in Canberra in October last year. (AAP Image/Mick Tsikas)\n\nMr Conroy said it would produce 15,000 rounds a year by 2028, with the capacity to scale up to 100,000 rounds and support 550 jobs.\n\nBut in June this year, the Department of Defence issued a media release \u2014 omitting references to Thales or Benalla \u2014 saying it would \"cease the current procurement activity\" and \"refine\" requirements before \"reapproaching the market\".\n\nThe department said there had been \"notable changes in the global defence industrial base\" since the tender was awarded in 2023.\n\n\"This has included a surge in international demand for naval five-inch and a significant increase in global capacity to produce 155mm projectiles,\" the statement read.\n\nIt said the changes required defence to \"re-assess\" the manufacture of 155mm projectiles.\n\nPat Conroy (second from left) at an earlier meeting with Thales Australia executives in Bendigo. (ABC Central Victoria: Tyrone Dalton)\n\n\"Defence remains committed to working with industry to deliver a 155mm M795 forging capability by 2028, producing 15,000 rounds each year, with further additional capacity that will be determined as part of the re-approach to market,\" the statement read.\n\nIn a statement, a Thales spokesperson said the company was aware of the department's decision \"to re-assess its manufacturing approach on 155mm M795 ammunition\".\n\n\"As a guided weapons and explosive ordnance (GWEO) strategic partner, we are continuing to work with the department on its reassessed 155mm requirements,\" she said.\n\nThales employees assembling 5.56mm ball ammunition on a production line at Benalla. (Supplied: Department of Defence )\n\nLocal disappointment\n\nThe Australian Manufacturing Workers Union has more than 100 members at Thales Australia in Benalla.\n\nOrganiser Danny Miller said with jobs disappearing from the Goulburn Valley, the news of the deal's cancellation was \"certainly a kick in the guts\".\n\nDanny Miller says the cancellation is a \"kick in the guts\" amid job losses in the region. (Supplied)\n\n\"Jobs have disappeared and there are not replacement jobs being put in place by all companies, including the government,\" he said.\n\nHe said the government needed to build defence capabilities at home.\n\n\"Australia needs to build this capability on our shores and not have dependence on foreign countries to supply our defence forces to protect our sovereignty, should the worst-case scenarios play out,\" he said.\n\n\"Spending should come to local jobs and local capabilities, which is something that has been significantly diminished since privatisation occurred.\"\n\nState MP for Euroa Annabelle Cleeland said investment in the broader community had been flagged as part of the partnership.\n\nThe Nationals MP said she had hoped this would lead to more housing for the region.\n\n\"During meetings that were held with contractors, we were told that a portion of investment would \u2026 go back into the local community as a kind of legacy project,\" she said.\n\nAnnabelle Cleeland says she had hoped the project would lead to more housing for the area. (Supplied: Annabelle Cleeland)\n\n\"In the meetings, we spoke about the areas of biggest need for these projects \u2014 and [at] the top were housing to avoid major shifts in the local rental market, the need for relevant TAFE courses to upskill locals, and funding for accommodations for Benalla Health.\"\n\nShe was concerned about the way the announcement was made.\n\n\"I am appalled about the way the Labor government has gone about \u2026 announcing this,\" she said.\n\n\" It reeks, to be honest. \"\n\n'Bigger and better' project possible\n\nAustralian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) executive director Justin Bassi said the decision, announced late on a Friday, suggested the government wanted little media attention.\n\nBut he was optimistic about greater opportunities for defence industry if the project went back out to tender, as suggested in the department's June announcement.\n\nHe said conflict overseas, specifically Russia's war on Ukraine, had created a surge in demand for ammunition like 155mm projectiles.\n\nJustin Bassi is optimistic about greater opportunities for defence industry if the project goes back out to tender. (Supplied: ASPI)\n\n\"The changes in the international environment, where many countries were realising that they had no stockpiles or their stockpiles were rapidly decreasing because of their important support for Ukraine \u2026 that was having an impact on the global supply,\" he said.\n\n\"And so defence was suggesting that they needed to take a re-look at what their request was before going back out to market.\"\n\nMr Bassi said governments should be able to pivot in response to international changes, and that the project's second incarnation could be \"bigger and better\".\n\nThe original announcement for 15,000 rounds a year was not sufficient in his view, as Australia needed enough stockpile for its own purposes beyond training.\n\n\"Hopefully the new project, whenever it is announced, has a far greater desired capacity,\" he said.\n\nFresh call for defence spending boost\n\nThe Department of Defence's relationship with Thales came under scrutiny last year after a $1.2 billion contract awarded to the French weapons manufacturer was referred to the corruption watchdog.\n\nIn a statement, Shadow Minister for Defence Jacinta Nampijinpa Price said the ceasing of the procurement was \"disappointing\".\n\nJacinta Nampijinpa Price says the scrapping of the procurement deal is disappointing. (AAP: Mick Tsikas)\n\n\"At a time when we need weapons and munitions at speed and scale, the Albanese government continues to move at a snail's pace,\" she said\n\n\"There would be greater certainty for defence industry if the government followed the Coalition's call to increase defence spending to at least 3 per cent of GDP, to fund the capabilities we need as per the government's own plans and strategies.\"\n\nThe Minister for Defence Industry has been contacted for comment.",

(AP: Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nThe Trump administration asked the justices to intervene quickly, arguing the law gave him the power to regulate imports and that striking down Is Trump about to create the next great financial crisis?\n\nThe case will come before a court that has been reluctant to check Trump's extraordinary flex of executive power.\n\nOne big question is whether the justices' own expansive view of presidential authority allows for Trump's tariffs without the explicit approval of Congress, which the Constitution endows with the power to levy tariffs.\n\nThree of the justices on the conservative-majority court were nominated by Mr Trump in his first term.\n\n'Economic catastrophe'\n\nWhile the tariffs have raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth, Mr Trump has also used them to pressure other countries into accepting new trade deals.\n\nTrump leveraging peacekeeping in tariff 'deals' across Asia Photo shows Two men speak at a press conference at the White House. With Thailand, Cambodia, and Pakistan receiving reduced tariff rates in Donald Trump's latest negotiations, it appears there is a pattern of \"good deals\" among those who accept his intervention in the region.\n\nRevenue from tariffs totalled $US159 billion ($242 billion) by late August, more than double what it was at the same point a year earlier.\n\nSolicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the lower court rulings are already affecting those trade negotiations.\n\nIf the tariffs are struck down, the US Treasury might take a hit by having to refund some of the import taxes it has collected, the president's administration has said.\n\nA ruling against them could even impair the nation's ability to reduce the flow of fentanyl and efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine, Mr Sauer argued.\n\nThe administration did win over four appeals court judges, who found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act let the president regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations.\n\nIn recent decades, Congress has ceded some tariff authority to the president and Mr Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.\n\nAdd to your watchlist Photo shows Mystery Road Origin ABC iview with young detective Jay Swan in the bush. The critically acclaimed Mystery Road: Origin returns as Detective Jay Swan (Mark Coles Smith) and Mary (Tuuli Narkle) uncover dark secrets in a haunted timber town, where the past threatens to tear them apart.\n\nThe case involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Mr Trump justified by declaring a national emergency: the tariffs first announced in April and the ones from February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.\n\nIt does not include his levies on foreign steel, aluminium and vehicles, or the tariffs Mr Trump imposed on China in his first term that were kept by Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nThe president can impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he can act.\n\nAP/Reuters",

It's like this black cloud over your head \u2026 you literally can't do anything,\" she said.\n\n\" It got to the point where I couldn't be there for my child. \"\n\nRecent data showed South Australians are now putting more than $1 billion through the pokies, crossing that threshold for the first time this year and up nearly $53 million from the previous 12 months.\n\nThe state government made more than $450 million from those losses.\n\nPokies a mother's 'kryptonite'\n\nLosses were particularly high in regional areas, with the combined Mount Gambier and Grant local government areas losing $24 million, about $720 per person.\n\nMs Healey, 42, described the pokies as her \"kryptonite\" and estimated she lost thousands of dollars gambling to escape the pressures of being a single parent to a child with a disability and her own mental health issues.\n\nShe always gambled on payday.\n\nThe important bills would get paid, but she would \"just blow\" the rest and when she was on a winning streak she would \"be in there more often than not\".\n\nHer addiction quickly became a \"perpetual cycle\" of borrowing money from family and friends and \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\".\n\n\"I would then have to worry about how I was going to feed myself and my child and get to the next pay,\" she said.\n\nIt was only after she won and lost $2,000 in one day that Ms Healey realised things had to change.\n\n\"[I felt] devastated and really disappointed with myself that I could do that.

(ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nThe Greens recently called on the SA government to phase out all pokies by 2030.\n\nMs Murphy thought it would be difficult for governments to turn away from the revenue pokies brought in.\n\nBut she wanted more of that money to be spent on services to help people facing addiction.\n\nAn auditor general report from 2023 showed just one per cent \u2014 $5.38 million \u2014 of all gambling revenue received by the state government went back into the Gamblers Rehabilitation Fund.\n\n\"Indexing what they spend on harm to the revenue raised on gambling would be really helpful for service providers,\" Ms Murphy said.\n\nConsumer and Business Affairs Minister Andrea Michaels said rather than banning gaming machines, the focus was on \"supporting those who experience gambling-related harm\" and reducing the number of machines in the state.\n\nThe minister did not comment on the Gamblers Rehabilitation Fund.\n\n'Massive problem'\n\nMs Healey eventually found help with her addiction through Lifeline and now works with the service to help others.\n\nBec Healy wants to see the state government take a \"moral\" stand on gambling harm. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nShe said it would be \"moral\" to ban pokies outright and wants to see more done to help people experiencing addiction.\n\n\"To think large amounts of money like that are going through those machines, it's pretty devastating,\" she said.\n\n\"How many other people are in the position I was in?\n\n\"It's a massive problem \u2026 I think more could be put back into helping.\"",

(Getty Images: Lintao Zhang)\n\nUnlike the Olympics in 2021, when endurance events were moved north to Sapporo to avoid the heat, the World Championship will hold the long-distance walking events and marathons in Tokyo.\n\nThe 35km race walk will start at 8am, local time (9am AEST), on Saturday.\n\nThe women's and men's marathon are also scheduled to start at 8am on Sunday and Monday, respectively.\n\n\"I don't think it's any great secret, we do have some heat challenges in Tokyo,\" Coe said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm very proud to be able to say, with full justification, that we have the most accomplished and the most capable health and science team in any international sport and frankly, any sporting organisation.\n\n\"That shouldn't come as a surprise because we have been dealing with some of these challenges for a long time.\"\n\nLord Sebastian Coe questioned the inaction of world leaders to mitigate climate change. (Getty Images: Tim Clayton)\n\nCoe said sport was having to take the lead on climate change issues, taking aim at world leaders for their inaction.\n\n\"Some of you have heard me talk about the challenges of climate change. These are not transient. They're here to stay,\" Coe, the British two-time Olympic 1,500m champion in 1980 and 1984, said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"Governments have not stepped up to the plate, and sport is going to have to take some unilateral judgements and decisions here.\n\n\"If we are committed to athlete welfare, then we should probably be openly committed to that.\"\n\nHe added that international sport as a whole will have to \"revisit\" the global calendar to account for rising temperatures and admitted that there may need to be some flexibility if conditions worsened in Tokyo.\n\n\"If we are committed to athlete welfare, then it is inevitable that we are going to have to stage some of our endurance-based events maybe at times of the year that are going to give optimum chances for the athletes, and not leave them in a health or a performance deficit,\" Coe said.\n\n\"But what I can say is that we have the right people in place in Tokyo, and the right discussions taking place if we had to make any adjustments to the timetable in advance of those scheduled events because of these conditions.\"",

    "text": "\u201cWhen [his mother] Judy dropped him off at Murphy\u2019s Caulfield stables in the mid \u201970s, Andrew was officially the smallest and lightest apprentice in Victoria,\u201d Green told a small gathering of family and friends in Federation Chapel at Lilydale Memorial Park. \u201cFor the next six or seven years, we slept in adjacent beds in the kids\u2019 dorm. A young Andrew Vine had to give up being a jockey in the early 1980s after breaking his pelvis in a track accident. \u201cWe ate our meals together, we worked and rode horses alongside each other, and we gave each other unconditional support through the many challenges of that brutal and chaotic environment.\u201d Vine and Green both entered the stable environment as 14-year-olds, having been granted early exemption from the education department. It was no place for a teenage boy.\n\nThey were at the mercy of sadistic and perverted stable staff and because they had been indentured as apprentices by the state\u2019s governing body of racing, felt like they had little choice but to abide. Their treatment was kept as a dark secret for 30 years; they battled drug and alcohol addictions, and their pain was not aired in public until the 2008 \u201cJockey Ritual Trial\u201d in the County Court. Vine and Green were key prosecution witnesses in a case that led to two Caulfield stable hands \u2013 John Finlayson and John William Honeysett \u2013 being convicted of indecent assault during the 1970s. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget Andrew\u2019s unwavering supporting testimony that he gave under extreme pressure from a pair of rabid defence lawyers,\u201d Green said. \u201cHe was staunch and tough, and he didn\u2019t give an inch.\u201d\n\nLoading Until Vine\u2019s death, he hoped for restitution and accountability. He was to be part of a civil case against Victoria Racing Club, which was racing\u2019s governing body until 2001, seeking redress for historical pain and suffering. Despite his promise to Green to stay alive, he could not reverse his slide into ailing health, and died at home. Vine never had his day in court. Instead, family and friends were left on Friday to make sense of the 64-year-old\u2019s tumultuous life. Vine\u2019s first winner made headlines. He booted home 140-1 shot Tobazari at Caulfield in the late 1970s as an apprentice. But his riding career ended abruptly when he broke his pelvis during a training accident.\n\nHe entered the workforce and started a family in the late 1980s \u2013 taking in partner Margaret\u2019s children Mark and Tara before having a son of their own, Jesse, in 1992. But the injuries kept coming. Vine broke his neck in a workplace accident around the time his son was born, and eight years later he was clipped by a passing car while helping an elderly woman change a tyre. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call an ambulance,\u201d his son Jesse said. \u201cHe just walked it off, went home and laid on the floor because he insisted it was less painful than laying in bed. \u201cA few surgeries, and a few years later, his back was still no good.\n\n\u201cHe definitely didn\u2019t do himself any favours, not getting any details of anyone that was there, or any witnesses. So he was sort of left to fend for himself. \u201cBut that was Andrew. He never wanted to make a fuss.\u201d Former apprentice jockey Andrew Vine was described as a \u2018rough diamond\u2019 at his funeral service. Vine and Margaret separated in 1996, but became best friends. He would later become a \u201cstepfather\u201d to her fourth child, Mia, whose own father died in 2007 when she was four and a half years old. \u201cMia and I moved into Andrew\u2019s, and he looked after myself and Mia like she was his own,\u201d Margaret said.\n\nVine was described on Friday as a \u201ccool dad\u201d and a \u201cbit of a rough diamond\u201d. He had a \u201cbiker period\u201d, worked on cars in his backyard, enjoyed a punt and didn\u2019t mind a go on the pokies. His son even compared him to a hard-living rocker. \u201cWhen Ozzy Osborne died at the age of 76, I thought, \u2018I reckon Dad\u2019s got another good 10 years left at least\u2019. But, yeah, apparently not, Dad,\u201d Jesse said. But above all, Green said, Vine was \u201cdecent, kind, generous and unflinchingly loyal\u201d. \u201cHe was a proud and devoted father to Jesse, a committed partner to Margaret, a loving son, brother and uncle,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cHe truly loved animals, and we all know that animal lovers are the very best of people. For me, Andrew is my dearest friend. In many ways, my only true friend, and I\u2019ll never, ever forget him.\u201d Green has now farewelled all three of his former roommates from their horrific Caulfield apprentice days. Three years ago, Vine was one of more than a hundred witnesses, not all of them victims, who took part in a review of historic abuse within the Victorian racing industry. The Office of the Racing Integrity Commissioner released a 78-page paper in September 2023 calling on racing\u2019s three codes \u2013 gallops, harness and greyhounds \u2013 to draw on \u201cbest practice from other sports and industries\u201d to create a redress scheme for victims within 12 months. Racing Victoria announced a \u201crestorative engagement program\u201d for \u201cimpacted individuals\u201d last month. It is open for submissions for six months from September 1.",

    "text": "Postecoglou and Clough are very different blokes, of course, but are kindred spirits, personally and philosophically. They\u2019re both good for a quote. They\u2019re both combative, possibly too much so. They\u2019re both deep believers in the inherent romance of the game and recognise their role in delivering it to fans by playing romantic football. They\u2019re both magnetic characters who can convince a group of men to buy into a vision and give their all for it. A keen student of football history, there\u2019s little doubt that Postecoglou - now that he has been confirmed as Forest\u2019s new manager - has been not only inspired by Clough on his coaching journey, but will be determined to reach for the stars at the same club, in the same way. Brian Clough shakes hands with Forest chairman Jim Willmer at his appointment in 1975. Credit: Press Association Photos Before we get too positive, it\u2019s worth pointing out the potholes ahead for Postecoglou in his Premier League return. There\u2019s one big one in particular.\n\nEvangelos Marinakis, Forest\u2019s owner, seems like a pretty combustible guy. There are, let\u2019s say, some ethical concerns when it comes to his background. He fell out publicly with Postecoglou\u2019s predecessor, Nuno Espirito Santo, and has a track record at both Forest and Olympiacos (one of the other clubs he owns), which suggests a shortage of patience. There\u2019s a bit of Trump-Musk about this union, an unholy alliance between two powerful, larger-than-life characters. This, too, could blow up as spectacularly. The early predictions are that this will end in tears - but don\u2019t discount the possibility that they might be happy tears. Marinakis at a Nottingham Forest game last season. Credit: Getty Images Let\u2019s give them both a bit of credit here. Marinakis isn\u2019t blind; he saw everything Tottenham Hotspur did in Postecoglou\u2019s two-year stint, from his spectacular start to last season\u2019s 22 league defeats and 17th-placed league finish, from which the most reactionary sections of the British press have entirely separated from any sense of context (ie. injuries! They\u2019re a thing!). He saw the \u201csuicidal\u201d high defensive line against Chelsea. He also saw that they finished fifth in 2023-24. Yes, their last league campaign fizzled, but Postecoglou left Spurs with their first European trophy in decades, and a platform that Thomas Frank is now building on.\n\nMarinakis will have had personal explanations from Postecoglou about all the extenuating circumstances. He knows exactly what kind of manager he has just appointed, and we presume he has done so because he likes everything he brings to the table, and wants that for his club. And Postecoglou should know the bloke better than most. Famous last words, perhaps, but if anyone can tame the wild beast that is Marinakis, it might be him. They seem to have a close personal relationship. Both are proud Greeks who hung out in Greece during the off-season; it would be zero surprise if this move has actually been many weeks in the making, and that some of Forest\u2019s recent transfer dealings were made with a view to him being involved at some stage this term. Postecoglou with his victorious Tottenham players after the Europe League triumph. Credit: Getty Images That\u2019d partly explain why Postecoglou so quickly turned down approaches from Brentford, Saudi Arabian side Al-Ahli, Los Angeles FC, Fenerbahce and Bayer Leverkusen in recent weeks. Forest are a club on the up, which is new territory for Postecoglou; usually he takes over teams in decline. Last season, they placed seventh, their best finish in 30 years, and will play in the Europa League despite qualifying for the Conference League due to a convoluted ruling around Crystal Palace and multi-club ownership.\n\nBut there\u2019s work ahead that fits his brief. Marinakis says he wants Postecoglou\u2019s help to \u201cbuild something special\u201d, to take Forest from just another Premier League into one that wins things, and does so in style. Postecoglou, like Clough, offers something different: the courage to be stupid. The difficulty will be the abrupt shift from Espirito Santo\u2019s conservative, ball-allergic counter-attacking style towards Postecoglou\u2019s expansive, attacking modus operandi. But that\u2019s not exactly an unfamiliar challenge; Espirito Santo was one of the succession of unsuccessful Spurs managers whose templates Postecoglou was brought in to rip apart. Loading Forest\u2019s squad, while largely geared towards Nunoball, has plenty of talent capable of playing on the front foot, like Morgan Gibbs-White, the English international who Spurs somehow failed to sign; Callum Hudson-Odoi, Omari Hutchinson and Dan Ndoye, three exciting, explosive wingers; new signing Douglas Luiz, an all-round excellent midfielder; and full-backs Ola Aina and Neco Williams, who look like perfect fits for a system that asks them to invert.\n\nThere are certainly some pieces that might not fit as perfectly. Kiwi striker Chris Wood, for instance, might not have it in him to press as incessantly at Postecoglou likes his forwards to do. Defenders Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic might not enjoy walking the tightrope on the halfway line. Though the transfer window has just shut, there\u2019s scope to make any necessary changes in January and beyond. Unlike former Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, Marinakis doesn\u2019t dilly-dally on the transfer market. If there\u2019s a player he wants, he goes and gets them. Loading Forest\u2019s squad is big, too, with second and in some instances third-choice options available in almost every position, which makes them better prepared to compete in multiple competitions than Spurs were last season. The jokes at Postecoglou\u2019s expense were being cracked before his announcement was even confirmed. He always wins things in his second season - so he\u2019ll get them relegated and win next season\u2019s English Championship title, then. When Aina went off hurt after just 10 minutes of action for Nigeria on Wednesday morning (AEST), Postecoglou was instantly blamed, and the myth of his apparently hapless training methods was immediately raised. The doubters are out in force already, the narrative arc set. However, what they overlook is that Postecoglou will be a better manager due to his Tottenham experience. He says he takes away something new from every training session, much less every job. Those who say he can\u2019t \u201cadapt\u201d overlook that not only has he successfully adapted to football in four different countries now, but he even adapted at Spurs; the way they played in the Europa League was almost the antithesis of the singular way he is alleged to be dogmatically wedded to.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The bitter rivalry between Touk Miller and Dayne Zorko has defined the ferocity of their derby clashes for seven years, as the pair prepare to face off in the most crucial battle in Queensland\u2019s AFL history. In the Gold Coast Suns\u2019 fledgling days, when the QClash struggled for relevancy in a state dominated by rugby league, the on-field feud between the two competitors helped ignite a genuine intrastate rivalry. Their history dates back to early 2018, when Miller held his Brisbane Lions\u2019 rival to just 10 touches while finishing with 21 disposals of his own to win the second of his four Marcus Ashcroft Medals \u2013 the award for the best player on ground in the Queensland derby. The midfielder patted Zorko on the back and offered a handshake, which the latter refused. When they met later that year, their battle was bruising, with Zorko gaining the upper hand in a tight Lions win. Brisbane\u2019s veteran was spotted laughing at Miller as he extended his hand. The tension escalated further in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being cleared by the match review officer in round 20 of that season, an AFL investigation led to Miller receiving a one-game suspension for \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d after contacting Zorko\u2019s groin in a tackle. Miller, now 29, admitted he harboured hatred for the defending premiers yet could not help but praise his nemesis. Loading \u201c[Zorko\u2019s] a fantastic player \u2013 I respect the way he goes about it on the field \u2013 and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to clash at some point,\u201d Miller said, as his Suns prepared for a semi-final showdown with Brisbane. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably spark a bit of crowd noise, but it just adds to the fuel for the rivalry. \u201cIn games like this, you separate yourself from what\u2019s been said in the past. \u201cWe probably haven\u2019t gone at it for quite some time now, to be really honest with you. That patch where we did have a good two- or three-year span, I was tagging him for quite some time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the past 15 years, only competition points had been at stake between the two sides. Now, a preliminary final beckons. The Lions seek retribution for their Geelong humbling, while the Suns aim to mark their maiden finals foray with a deep September run after their one-point triumph over Fremantle. Has Dayne Zorko\u2019s shift to the backline all but ended his battles with Touk Miller? We will find out on Saturday. Credit: via Getty Images Suns legend Gary Ablett Junior said with a laugh that he was \u201cnot going to add\u201d to the notion the Miller-Zorko rivalry could rear again, but he warned the most composed outfit would emerge victorious. \u201cTouk\u2019s a competitor, and so is Zorko \u2013 they\u2019re the type of guys you want on your team. They want to win,\u201d Ablett Jnr said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading \u201cI\u2019m a big believer it doesn\u2019t matter what game you\u2019re playing in \u2013 whether it be regular season games or finals \u2013 you need to be preparing the same way. \u201cThat\u2019s always the challenge, making sure the players are preparing the way they normally would \u2026 and then when you get into the game, you\u2019ve got to stay composed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to play instinctive footy and read the game.\u201d Levi Ashcroft will have the chance to step up in Lachie Neale\u2019s absence. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images A hamstring injury kept Miller sidelined when the Suns last faced the Lions \u2013 a 66-point Gold Coast demolition masterminded by Matt Rowell (37 disposals, 15 clearances). But Miller is ready to rise again on Saturday. While the Suns have won just eight of 29 QClashes, he has averaged 21.12 disposals, 4.82 clearances and 5.24 tackles from 17 games, while kicking seven goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRivalries probably always bring out the best in most people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for long enough to learn that every time we get a chance to have a go at them, I\u2019m always going to try my best to get us the win.\u201d The midfield battle could well decide this contest, where rookie Levi Ashcroft has been tipped to join brother Will Ashcroft, Josh Dunkley and Hugh McCluggage in filling the void left by Lachie Neale\u2019s season-ending calf injury. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a massive void, but we\u2019re confident in our youth,\u201d Dunkley said. \u201cLevi Ashcroft plays on the wing, I\u2019ve talked about him being really selfless and one of the guys who will put his hand up this week to take that role. \u201cWhoever fills the void will do a good job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The day before my daughter was born, I curled up in bed and watched the first season of The Summer I Turned Pretty. It was a grey August, and the sun-kissed scenes at the fictional Cousins Beach proved a brief escape from my impending responsibilities. In 2023, I quietly cursed myself for wasting possibly my last day of guilt-free TV on a show about American teenagers reluctant to date outside their childhood friendship pool. But two years on, here I am watching the third and final season as Amazon Prime Video drip-feeds weekly episodes of the show based on the young-adult book trilogy by Jenny Han (To All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before). Loading And I\u2019m not alone. The series, in which Isabel \u2018Belly\u2019 Conklin (Lola Tung) has conflicted feelings for two brothers, Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher (Christopher Briney and Gavin Casalegno), is more popular than ever. And, at its heart, it\u2019s this love triangle that seems to draw people in. I\u2019m not the only self-respecting adult pledging their allegiance to #TeamConrad or #TeamJeremiah like it\u2019s the early oughts. While particularly prominent in teen fiction, TV writers have long leaned on the trope of the love triangle. It often plays out like this: an \u2018attractive\u2019 protagonist, often cis female, has to choose between a brooding bad boy and one who is more emotionally available. Some critics say the love triangle in YA fiction is at a crossroads with binary choices less appealing to a modern audience. Others point out that in the specific case of TSITP, the love triangle offers two equally unenticing options. Whatever the case, Belly and the Fisher brothers are just the latest in a long line of TV love triangles. Here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of some of the most memorable. Carrie, Big and Aidan (Sex and the City) As fictional love triangles go, it\u2019s hard to go past Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), Big (Chris Noth) and Aidan (John Corbett) from Sex and the City \u2013 a dynamic so enduring it was resurrected (against some fans\u2019 wishes) decades later in the sequel series And Just Like That... Carrie and Big\u2019s relationship was marked by miscommunication, mismatched desires and unmet needs. By contrast, everything with Aidan initially seemed easy. Aidan\u2019s southern country charm was contrasted to Big\u2019s cigars and avoidant attachment style. Like TSITP, it\u2019s compelling (and frustrating) to watch our protagonist swing from one archetype to another, making ill-informed choices along the way. Both shows offer plenty of opportunities to scream at the TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Karl, Susan and Izzy (Neighbours) Dr Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) on Neighbours. Everybody needs good neighbours. Unless good neighbours turn out to be good friends who have extramarital affairs with Natalie Bassingthwaighte. This love triangle, surely the longest-running on Australian TV, had Dr Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), his wife Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Izzy (Bassingthwaighte) in a twist, from the initial affair in 2004 to Izzy\u2019s return in 2018. Soap operas like Neighbours are the natural home of the love triangle, where characters have seemingly endless complications thrown their way. As Woodburne recently told The Guardian of her character Susan: \u201cI\u2019ve had some fantastic storylines: I was diagnosed with MS, I was abducted \u2026 and the Karl and Susan love triangle with Izzy will always remain a favourite as there was so much comedy, drama and tragedy. You don\u2019t go through your husband almost fathering a child that isn\u2019t his, and come out the other side the same person!\u201d Indeed. Buffy, Angel and Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Credit: Teenage vampire slayers need love too, and in the \u201990s and early 2000s, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) found herself torn between two vampires, Angel (David Boreanaz) and Spike (James Marsters). There\u2019s a lot on the line for this trio; Angel has his soul taken away when he and Buffy sleep together. Spike has his reputation as a bad boy to uphold. Unlike others on this list, Buffy ultimately chooses neither love interest. But that hasn\u2019t stopped rabid fans from choosing their own side. Meredith, Derek and Addison (Grey\u2019s Anatomy)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy might hold the record for the most love triangles on TV. Where to start? George, Izzie and Callie? Callie, Arizona and Mark? Mark, Derek and Addison? Of course, it has to be Meredith (Ellen Pompeo), Derek (Patrick Dempsey) and Addison (Kate Walsh). This one is responsible for one of the greatest lines in the show\u2019s 21 seasons, levelled at Meredith: \u201cAnd you must be the woman who\u2019s been screwing my husband\u201d. Technically, they were estranged. But even after Meredith asks Derek to choose her in a now-famous speech not unlike Conrad\u2019s entreaty to Belly the night before her wedding, he picks Addison. If I was a patient at this hospital, I\u2019d hope these doctors would pick me over their endless romantic trysts, but it makes for fascinating television. Rory, Jess and Dean (Gilmore Girls) Milo Ventimiglia and Alexis Bledel in Gilmore Girls Who can forget when Luke Danes\u2019 troubled-yet-bookish nephew, Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia), comes to Stars Hollow? Not every millennial who rewatches Gilmore Girls on an annual basis, that\u2019s for sure. Some have even drawn parallels from Jess\u2019 broody appeal to Conrad. Jess steals Rory\u2019s heart in a way her first boyfriend Dean Forester (Jared Padalecki) couldn\u2019t. He\u2019s smart, rebellious, and wants more for Rory than a life as a housewife in a small town. Throughout the series, Rory flits between both characters, eventually dating someone entirely different who meets her grandparents\u2019 elitist expectations at Yale. Fun! Still, it\u2019s hard to forget the Jess era, even if he did crash the car Dean built for her. Dawson, Pacey and Joey (Dawson\u2019s Creek) Joshua Jackson (Pacey), Katie Holmes (Joey) and James Van der Beek (Dawson) in Dawson\u2019s Creek.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "More people are going to a hospital in Australia's biggest healthcare system, as doctors claim critical figures are being hidden from the public.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSW hospital admissions have hit record levels, with more than 515,000 admitted patient episodes in the quarter from April to June 2025, the latest Healthcare Quarterly report by the Bureau of Health Information says.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 65,000 elective surgeries were performed across NSW, the highest number in any quarter since the bureau started reporting in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of patients on the waiting list at the end of June who had waited longer than clinically recommended for their surgery dropped to 2,534 \u2014 down from 8,588 at the end of March 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Australian Medical Association NSW president Kathryn Austin said stark figures were buried in the report released on Wednesday and questioned the bureau's presentation of data.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe pointed to how only 66.1 per cent of non-urgent surgeries, which should be completed within a year, were performed on time, marking a sharp decline from 82.4 per cent in the same quarter in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hiding these results does not make the problem go away \u2014 it only undermines confidence in the system and makes it harder to drive necessary change,\" Austin said.\n\n\n\nThe association said one in 10 patients spent longer than 13 hours and six minutes in the emergency department in urban hospitals, a trend it said was unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Bureau of Health Information said it applied the same criteria of \"objectivity, fairness and meaningfulness\" when highlighting key findings each quarter, regardless of the nature of the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decrease in the percentage of elective surgeries performed on time measure is a direct result of the large number of patients who had been overdue receiving their surgery during the quarter,\" a bureau spokesperson told AAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Surgery waiting time information remains available in the key findings, along with graphs clearly presenting waiting times and the percentage of surgeries performed on time.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Doctors' groups take temperature on appetite for health care reform SBS News 06:35 English\n\nNSW Health Minister Ryan Park said even though hospitals continued to experience high demand, the government was working towards relieving pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're investing in more staff, more hospitals and more beds, more quickly, and we're seeing lower wait times and less ramping,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While lower ED wait times and ramping are promising, there is still more to be done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe attributed the drop-offs to a recruitment drive of nearly 3,000 full-time health workers as retention rates return to pre-pandemic levels, and an uptake of urgent and virtual care health services.\n\n\n\nNSW Health Minister Ryan Park said that, despite hospitals continuing to experience high demand, the government was working towards relieving the pressure. Source: AAP / Dan Himbrechts Emergency departments had 785,084 attendances, with a slight drop of 1.3 per cent from the same quarter in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nBureau acting chief executive Hilary Rowell said: \"Fewer patients with less-urgent conditions presented to EDs. However, there were record numbers of patients presenting with more serious conditions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report notes nearly 80 per cent of patients who arrived by ambulance were transferred to ED staff within 30 minutes \u2014 up 5.6 percentage points compared with the same time in 2024.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Making the switch from branded products to a store's home brand alternatives could save shoppers thousands of dollars each year at checkout, according to a financial comparison website.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew analysis from Compare the Market indicates Australians are spending around $200 each week on average at the supermarket, but could save approximately $80 on these transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy comparing the costs of 20 staple items at two major supermarkets, it found people could save $4,212 annually thanks to the price gap between more expensive products and cheaper home brand items.\n\n\n\nWhat were the biggest price differences?\n\nCompare the Market estimates Australians are spending around $198.16 on their weekly shop, equivalent to $858.69 each month and $10,304.32 annually.\n\n\n\nCompare the Market spokesman Phillip Portman told SBS News people could potentially cut their spending in half if they buy home brand products, which were on average 49 per cent cheaper than their brand-name counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The brand-name trolley of items like bread, milk, eggs, and cheese came in at around $164, but the home-brand trolley came in at about $83. So, a huge saving and probably a lot bigger than what we were expecting,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitching to home brand products could save you $23 on a 4kg pack of laundry powder, $9.50 on 200g of instant coffee, $7.20 on a one-litre body wash, $6 on a 500ml mouthwash, and $5 on a 750ml multipurpose cleaning spray.\n\n\n\nIn its August survey, Compare the Market found people could save $4,212 annually by taking advantage of the price gap between more expensive products and cheaper home brand items. Source: SBS News Kate Browne, head of research at Compare Club, told SBS News home brand quality in Australia is \"very good\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing you might miss is a range of options. A home brand pasta sauce might just have only tomatoes in it, Browne said, while a branded version could include basil, garlic, or other flavours.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, price differences also come down to extras \u2014 like whether your tinned tomatoes have a ring-pull lid or not, she said.\n\n\n\nWhich types of products were cheaper?\n\nPortman said the biggest price differences are in the toiletries aisle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you give yourself a bit of wiggle room around things like shower gels or mouthwash, that's where we stand to see the biggest savings. It's also those cleaning items that tend to come with a bigger price difference,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Things like sponges, cleaning wipes, floor cleaner, they all come with a big saving if you are willing to switch.\"\n\n\n\nThe smallest savings were made on home-brand food items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could save around 30 cents on frozen peas, 50 cents on butter, and 75 cents on yoghurt.\n\n\n\nWhy are home brand products cheaper?\n\nSarah Megginson, media spokesperson at financial comparison site Finder, previously told SBS News there are a few reasons why home brand products cost less than branded ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include reduced packaging costs, fewer or no margins for intermediaries in the supply chain, and sometimes lower ingredient or formulation costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the biggest factor? Minimal marketing spend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Brands not only invest huge dollars in brand development and marketing campaigns for their products out in the world, but they also spend a small fortune with Woolworths to secure 'shelf space' in the prized eye-level shelves or end of aisles,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Home brand products are obviously not investing in this \u2014 they're happily sitting on the bottom shelves, out of the way of their more expensive counterparts.\"\n\n\n\nFor supermarkets, home brand products can be more than a budget-friendly option for shoppers \u2014 they're also a profit booster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Supermarkets love home brands because they own those brands,\" Browne said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen a huge shift in the way our supermarkets in Australia retail. Ten or 12 years ago, there were a lot more name brands. Now we've seen a huge shift to more and more supermarket-owned brands, and that is purely for profit.\"\n\n\n\nOther ways to save\n\nPortman said there are several other ways to save on your grocery bill if you plan ahead of your shopping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Try to plan meals around what items are going to be on special. It could also mean splitting your shop between multiple stores and not just staying loyal to the one store,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We always encourage people to vote with their wallets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also suggested looking past the overall cost of a product and checking the unit price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That gives you a bit of a better understanding of whether it's better to buy a smaller quantity, or whether buying in bulk is going to save you more money.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Alexandra Koster.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will soon arrive in Solomon Islands' capital, Honiara, to attend a regional summit that has become a point of tension between China, Taiwan, and Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe annual Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) counts Australia among its 18 member states and is also usually attended by its non-member 'dialogue partners', which include China, the United States, India, Japan and others.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this year the event is members-only, although Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele has said a meeting with dialogue partners will be held at a later date.\n\n\n\n'A bit of a walk back'\n\nThe Lowy Institute's Pacific Islands Program director, Mihai Sora, said the members-only decision started with Solomon Islands' announcement that it would exclude Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan isn't an an official PIF dialogue partner but has been part of the international delegation at PIF meetings for several decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When Solomon Islands telegraphed that they intended to exclude Taiwan from this meeting, some Pacific leaders, as well as Australia and New Zealand, criticised the move,\" said Sora, a former Australian diplomat who previously served in Solomon Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For a few Pacific countries, in fact, they threatened to boycott the meeting altogether,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Solomon Islands' decision to exclude all dialogue partners is a bit of a walk back from that ... the main objective is to exclude Taiwan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen announcing in August that dialogue partners would not be invited, Manele said this was because a review of each country's relationship with the Pacific had not been completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Pacific leaders said Solomon Islands made the decision after pressure from China. Wang Xiaolong, China's ambassador to New Zealand, denied this, but said Taiwan \"does not belong\" at the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not renounced the use of force to bring he island under its control. Taiwan strongly objects to the sovereignty claims and says only the island's people can decide their future.\n\n\n\nMany Pacific Islands Forum members are already in Honiara for the 54th leaders meeting and attended sessions on Monday morning. Source: Facebook / The Government of the Republic of Nauru Solomon Islands ended 36 years of diplomatic relations with Taiwan and switched allegiance to China in 2019, signing a security pact with China in 2022 that raised Australia's ire .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Solomon Islands' government thought that it would be more palatable to members if they could say that they're excluding all dialogue partners, and the reason being that it would allow Pacific leaders more bandwidth, more airtime to focus on their own issues rather than having to service international commitments in the same week,\" Sora said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer PIF governance and engagement director Sione Tekiteki expressed similar sentiments, saying the decision to exclude all countries was primarily aimed at avoiding tensions between Pacific countries affiliated with China and those affiliated with Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they invited China and not Taiwan, the countries affiliated with Taiwan would've been upset. And if it were the status quo, then Solomon's China relationship would probably have been marred,\" said Tekiteki, who is now a senior lecturer at Auckland University's Technology Law School.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, it was probably the only solution under the current circumstances.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Taiwan once had six allies in the region, this number has now been reduced to three: Tuvalu, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. Meanwhile, 13 of PIF's members have ties with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because China is so powerful and there's so much influence and resources, you could make the observation that it's slowly, through all of the influence, getting countries to change allegiance,\" Tekiteki said.\n\n\n\nSolomon Islands minister for foreign affairs and external trade Peter Shanel Agovaka welcomes delegates to this year's PIF. Source: Facebook / Pacific Islands Forum Sora agreed, saying Taiwan \"wasn't really investing very much in the development space, in the political cultivation space, it wasn't a key development or economic partner for Pacific countries\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China, on the other hand, is the world's largest market, which is high potential for Pacific countries seeking to export their resources, their fish, their logs, their minerals, and so it's got that market appeal and it can also just simply offer more,\" Sora said.\n\n\n\nAccelerating competition\n\nThis year's summit has also become a staging ground for a power struggle between Australia and China.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late August, both countries presented Solomon Islands with fleets of vehicles to be used during the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina gifted 27 four-wheel-drive SUVs to ferry attendees around Honiara, while Australia donated 22 vehicles \u2014 part of a larger 61-vehicle package \u2014 to local police to ensure security at the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nTekiteki said it wasn't the first time China and Australia had sought to curry Pacific goodwill through gifts, but such manoeuvres had particular importance during a time \"when all the eyes are on the region\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the broader context of the geopolitical competition, you want to be that partner that's seen as providing the support. And things like vehicles are very noticeable, particularly from a security point of view,\" Tekiteki said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're providing the vehicles, for example, police and escorts and things like that, but also the vehicles that transport leaders, it's got a symbolic significance to it.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia's donation of several dozen police vehicles to Solomon Islands is part of a $20 million package, which also includes funding for cybersecurity and road upgrades. Source: Facebook / Solomon Star News Elena Collinson, manager of research analysis at the Australia-China Relations Institute, agreed the donations \"reflect a contest for visibility and influence\" and that \"Beijing is seeking to gain profile with leaders, while Canberra is seeking to reinforce security ties\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Neither 'owns' the space \u2014 Solomon Islands is leveraging both,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nManele said China's gift was \"a symbol of our strong and enduring partnership\" and Australia's marked \"another important milestone in the strong and enduring partnership\" between the two nations, local media reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nSora said China's gift was about \"the optics of being seen as a credible and accepted security partner for Pacific countries\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It uses this sort of imagery to amplify throughout the region that China's here to help.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite China dwarfing Australia in terms of both economic and military might, Sora said Australia has \"always far outstripped China\" as a partner in the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia's the largest infrastructure provider, the largest development funding provider, the largest grant provider. It's the main security partner. So that asymmetry on the ground is actually different,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia redirects foreign aid to Pacific and Southeast Asia after US cuts\n\n\"It's Australia that is the established dominant security partner for Pacific countries. That's what China is seeking to challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, it's a question partly of how much is China willing to invest in its security diplomacy, but also ... how much are Pacific countries willing to accommodate an increased Chinese security presence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One question that still remains to be seen is how long can Australia keep it up for? How long is China's interest going to be directed at the Pacific Islands region and what exactly does China want? How far into the region's security landscape does it want to push?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lowy Institute's 2024 Pacific Aid Map found Australia remained \"by far\" the region's largest donor, with China in second place.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is currently negotiating a $500 million security pact with Vanuatu, with Albanese heading to the Pacific nation before the PIF. However, before leaving, he told ABC Radio National that the deal wouldn't be signed during his visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile details of the deal remain unknown, it is believed to contain significant economic and security elements, which some speculate focus on decreasing China's policing presence on Vanuatu.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Australia's security deal with Vanuatu delayed SBS News 04:06 English\n\nA security agreement with Vanuatu failed in 2022, after the country's parliament voted against it amid concerns the deal was inconsistent with its foreign policy of non-alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWesley Morgan, a research associate with the Institute for Climate Risk and Response at the University of New South Wales, said following Solomon Islands' 2022 deal, Australia was \"keen to avoid a situation where other countries sign security deals with China\".\n\n\n\nAustralia's COP31 bid and climate policies\n\nCollinson said one of the main things Australia was hoping for from this year's summit was Pacific support for its proposal to host next year's Conference of the Parties (COP) climate talks in partnership with the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Pacific leaders have already signalled support for the bid, they've also been clear the credibility of Australia as a host depends on stronger climate action, Collinson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For Pacific leaders, the test of Australia's credibility isn't what it says at summits but whether its climate policies translate into real progress that people across the islands can feel in their daily lives,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why over a third of this nation's citizens want to migrate to Australia\n\nTekiteki said the main barrier to Australia securing the bid is that T\u00fcrkiye is still vying for hosting rights. But if Australia secures the hosting position, Pacific nations are likely to push Australia to take further action on climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pacific leaders will ask Australia, 'If you're going to host the COP, what kind of ambition are you going to make with regards to your own emissions and with your own policies pertaining to climate change?'\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, Pacific nations would be expecting from a host to really make some ambitious inroads into their own climate emissions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a major threat to the security and prosperity of small island states, climate change is a regular topic of discussion at PIF.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forum's members have long been urging wealthy, high-emitting countries like Australia to adopt more ambitious climate change mitigation policies and provide financial assistance to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has already committed $100 million to a fund set up to support smaller, community-scale adaptation projects in the Pacific, and Morgan said the Pacific Islands would be lobbying Australia to chip in more.\n\n\n\nMorgan also said the Albanese government would be under pressure to set an ambitious 2035 emissions-reduction target.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Pacific Island countries \"are crystal clear that climate change is their single greatest security threat\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Australia is to really cement its place as a security partner for Pacific governments, Australia will need to be taking action to address climate change, and that means setting as strong a target as possible to cut emissions over the next decade,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's 2035 target is set to be announced this month. Climate policy advocates are pushing Australia to set a target of at least 70 per cent, while the Coalition and business lobby groups have warned such reductions would be a severe burden to taxpayers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

This is an agreement that will also, importantly respect sovereignty of Vanuatu, but one as well that respects sovereignty of Australia.

It's simply about improving services, improving the lives for Aboriginal Victorians, and it will be doing so over a period of time, because treaty lays out some very clear rules around how together we will achieve this change - and change is very much needed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNepal's government has lifted a ban on social media platforms, a day after violent street protests that left 19 people dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatforms including Facebook, X and YouTube were blocked last week, with the government citing concerns about fake news and fraud.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban sparked a massive protest rally in the capital Kathmandu which descended into chaos as protesters stormed the parliament building .\n\n\n\n\n\nNineteen people were killed and more than 100 injured when police opened fire on demonstrators.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis morning the apps became available again, with the Prime Minister saying, the protest deaths will be investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities have also imposed an indefinite curfew within the Kathmandu city area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Murdoch family has reached a deal that will see Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan cement control of the family media empire, which includes Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFox Corp says it has reached a mutual resolution on the legal proceedings related to the Murdoch Family Trust, resulting in the termination of all litigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new family trust will be established to benefit James Murdoch, Grace Murdoch and Chloe Murdoch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Murdoch children will be beneficiaries of a new trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of the payment was not disclosed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnge Postecoglou is being tipped to return to the English Premier League following Nuno Espirito Santo's sacking as Nottingham Forest coach.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite only being given a new contract in June after guiding Forest into the Europa League last term, Nuno has been axed three games into the new season.\n\n\n\n",

The defendant only had a chronic condition that could be treated as an outpatient and did not require hospitalisation,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA corrections department vehicle carrying Thaksin was seen arriving at a Bangkok jail less than an hour after a ruling that has gripped the country, the latest drama in two weeks of political chaos that saw the fall of another Thaksin-backed populist government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 76-year-old power-broker is experiencing a period of political reckoning after his daughter and protege, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was sacked as prime minister by a court on 29 August \u2014 the sixth premier from or backed by the Shinawatra family to be removed by the judiciary or military.\n\n\n\nFormer Thai prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was sacked as prime minister by a court last month.

He'll still likely play a role within Pheu Thai,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I still have doubts that he would spend the whole year in jail, as there are still legal ways to cut his sentence.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance's parliament has voted to oust the country's Prime Minister, Francois Bayrou, who has lost a confidence motion and is expected to tender his resignation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as part of the opposition party's plan to bring down the government in the face of increasing national debt and a deepening political crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 74-year-old, who has been Prime Minister since December last year, addressed parliament shortly before politicians voted to oust him.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe gambled the parliament would back his view that the country must slash public spending to repair its debts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government is proposing a plan to the country, a debt reduction plan, so that France can escape in a few years the inexorable tide of debt that overwhelms it. In four years, which is a reasonable timeframe in the life of a country and its inhabitants, it's not that we will no longer have debt, but our debt will no longer increase. And here's the plan: to reach the threshold of three per cent of annual public deficits by 2029, a threshold beyond which the debt no longer increases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Bayrou was instead ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office says he will appoint a successor in the next few days.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the fifth time Mr Macron has had to find a new Prime Minister in two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench MP and President of the ultra-conservative National Rally, Marine Le Pen, addressed the National Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Leaders of both the right and the left, you are guilty. You cannot cry in front of the cameras about the consequences of the misdeeds you have committed yourselves. It is indeed a curious way of waiving the debts for which you are accountable, the deficits for which you are responsible, the general collapse for which you are guilty, in order to seek the confidence of Parliament.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have also been calls for the President to resign following the government's collapse.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition parties are calling for new elections, as liberal politicians claim the exit of Mr Bayrou is a victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench MP and president of France Unbowed, Mathilde Panot spoke after the no-confidence vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bayrou wanted a moment of truth and I believe he got it. But what the result shows, beyond even Bayrou's government, is the sham of Macron\u2019s people that is coming to light. Realise that only a third of the hemicycle gave its confidence to the Prime Minister. This means that Macron's policy for the rich, in the service of the rich and of social war against the people received two-thirds of unfavourable votes in the hemicycle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says they don't want yet another Prime Minister to continue the same policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result marks a new crisis for Europe\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the country's province of Clermont-Ferrand, anti-government protesters are celebrating the ouster of Mr Bayrou in front of a local town hall.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtestor Alan Petit is among those calling for Mr Macron to be unseated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now that the change of the prime minister is a done deal, they need to get rid of what's higher up. That's a message for Macron.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOrpheline Barbarine is a 31-year-old Agricultural Engineer who was at the protest.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is advocating change for women in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Politics in France today is completely unpredictable, but we are here to ensure that women are not forgotten. Women make up 52 per cent of the population, yet one woman is killed every three days. So until that changes and we are heard, we will be here, regardless of the government's fate.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\u201cWhen [his mother] Judy dropped him off at Murphy\u2019s Caulfield stables in the mid \u201970s, Andrew was officially the smallest and lightest apprentice in Victoria,\u201d Green told a small gathering of family and friends in Federation Chapel at Lilydale Memorial Park. \u201cFor the next six or seven years, we slept in adjacent beds in the kids\u2019 dorm. A young Andrew Vine had to give up being a jockey in the early 1980s after breaking his pelvis in a track accident. \u201cWe ate our meals together, we worked and rode horses alongside each other, and we gave each other unconditional support through the many challenges of that brutal and chaotic environment.\u201d Vine and Green both entered the stable environment as 14-year-olds, having been granted early exemption from the education department. It was no place for a teenage boy.\n\nThey were at the mercy of sadistic and perverted stable staff and because they had been indentured as apprentices by the state\u2019s governing body of racing, felt like they had little choice but to abide. Their treatment was kept as a dark secret for 30 years; they battled drug and alcohol addictions, and their pain was not aired in public until the 2008 \u201cJockey Ritual Trial\u201d in the County Court. Vine and Green were key prosecution witnesses in a case that led to two Caulfield stable hands \u2013 John Finlayson and John William Honeysett \u2013 being convicted of indecent assault during the 1970s. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget Andrew\u2019s unwavering supporting testimony that he gave under extreme pressure from a pair of rabid defence lawyers,\u201d Green said. \u201cHe was staunch and tough, and he didn\u2019t give an inch.\u201d\n\nLoading Until Vine\u2019s death, he hoped for restitution and accountability. He was to be part of a civil case against Victoria Racing Club, which was racing\u2019s governing body until 2001, seeking redress for historical pain and suffering. Despite his promise to Green to stay alive, he could not reverse his slide into ailing health, and died at home. Vine never had his day in court. Instead, family and friends were left on Friday to make sense of the 64-year-old\u2019s tumultuous life. Vine\u2019s first winner made headlines. He booted home 140-1 shot Tobazari at Caulfield in the late 1970s as an apprentice. But his riding career ended abruptly when he broke his pelvis during a training accident.\n\nHe entered the workforce and started a family in the late 1980s \u2013 taking in partner Margaret\u2019s children Mark and Tara before having a son of their own, Jesse, in 1992. But the injuries kept coming. Vine broke his neck in a workplace accident around the time his son was born, and eight years later he was clipped by a passing car while helping an elderly woman change a tyre. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call an ambulance,\u201d his son Jesse said. \u201cHe just walked it off, went home and laid on the floor because he insisted it was less painful than laying in bed. \u201cA few surgeries, and a few years later, his back was still no good.\n\n\u201cHe definitely didn\u2019t do himself any favours, not getting any details of anyone that was there, or any witnesses. So he was sort of left to fend for himself. \u201cBut that was Andrew. He never wanted to make a fuss.\u201d Former apprentice jockey Andrew Vine was described as a \u2018rough diamond\u2019 at his funeral service. Vine and Margaret separated in 1996, but became best friends. He would later become a \u201cstepfather\u201d to her fourth child, Mia, whose own father died in 2007 when she was four and a half years old. \u201cMia and I moved into Andrew\u2019s, and he looked after myself and Mia like she was his own,\u201d Margaret said.\n\nVine was described on Friday as a \u201ccool dad\u201d and a \u201cbit of a rough diamond\u201d. He had a \u201cbiker period\u201d, worked on cars in his backyard, enjoyed a punt and didn\u2019t mind a go on the pokies. His son even compared him to a hard-living rocker. \u201cWhen Ozzy Osborne died at the age of 76, I thought, \u2018I reckon Dad\u2019s got another good 10 years left at least\u2019. But, yeah, apparently not, Dad,\u201d Jesse said. But above all, Green said, Vine was \u201cdecent, kind, generous and unflinchingly loyal\u201d. \u201cHe was a proud and devoted father to Jesse, a committed partner to Margaret, a loving son, brother and uncle,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cHe truly loved animals, and we all know that animal lovers are the very best of people. For me, Andrew is my dearest friend. In many ways, my only true friend, and I\u2019ll never, ever forget him.\u201d Green has now farewelled all three of his former roommates from their horrific Caulfield apprentice days. Three years ago, Vine was one of more than a hundred witnesses, not all of them victims, who took part in a review of historic abuse within the Victorian racing industry. The Office of the Racing Integrity Commissioner released a 78-page paper in September 2023 calling on racing\u2019s three codes \u2013 gallops, harness and greyhounds \u2013 to draw on \u201cbest practice from other sports and industries\u201d to create a redress scheme for victims within 12 months. Racing Victoria announced a \u201crestorative engagement program\u201d for \u201cimpacted individuals\u201d last month. It is open for submissions for six months from September 1.",

    "text": "Postecoglou and Clough are very different blokes, of course, but are kindred spirits, personally and philosophically. They\u2019re both good for a quote. They\u2019re both combative, possibly too much so. They\u2019re both deep believers in the inherent romance of the game and recognise their role in delivering it to fans by playing romantic football. They\u2019re both magnetic characters who can convince a group of men to buy into a vision and give their all for it. A keen student of football history, there\u2019s little doubt that Postecoglou - now that he has been confirmed as Forest\u2019s new manager - has been not only inspired by Clough on his coaching journey, but will be determined to reach for the stars at the same club, in the same way. Brian Clough shakes hands with Forest chairman Jim Willmer at his appointment in 1975. Credit: Press Association Photos Before we get too positive, it\u2019s worth pointing out the potholes ahead for Postecoglou in his Premier League return. There\u2019s one big one in particular.\n\nEvangelos Marinakis, Forest\u2019s owner, seems like a pretty combustible guy. There are, let\u2019s say, some ethical concerns when it comes to his background. He fell out publicly with Postecoglou\u2019s predecessor, Nuno Espirito Santo, and has a track record at both Forest and Olympiacos (one of the other clubs he owns), which suggests a shortage of patience. There\u2019s a bit of Trump-Musk about this union, an unholy alliance between two powerful, larger-than-life characters. This, too, could blow up as spectacularly. The early predictions are that this will end in tears - but don\u2019t discount the possibility that they might be happy tears. Marinakis at a Nottingham Forest game last season. Credit: Getty Images Let\u2019s give them both a bit of credit here. Marinakis isn\u2019t blind; he saw everything Tottenham Hotspur did in Postecoglou\u2019s two-year stint, from his spectacular start to last season\u2019s 22 league defeats and 17th-placed league finish, from which the most reactionary sections of the British press have entirely separated from any sense of context (ie. injuries! They\u2019re a thing!). He saw the \u201csuicidal\u201d high defensive line against Chelsea. He also saw that they finished fifth in 2023-24. Yes, their last league campaign fizzled, but Postecoglou left Spurs with their first European trophy in decades, and a platform that Thomas Frank is now building on.\n\nMarinakis will have had personal explanations from Postecoglou about all the extenuating circumstances. He knows exactly what kind of manager he has just appointed, and we presume he has done so because he likes everything he brings to the table, and wants that for his club. And Postecoglou should know the bloke better than most. Famous last words, perhaps, but if anyone can tame the wild beast that is Marinakis, it might be him. They seem to have a close personal relationship. Both are proud Greeks who hung out in Greece during the off-season; it would be zero surprise if this move has actually been many weeks in the making, and that some of Forest\u2019s recent transfer dealings were made with a view to him being involved at some stage this term. Postecoglou with his victorious Tottenham players after the Europe League triumph. Credit: Getty Images That\u2019d partly explain why Postecoglou so quickly turned down approaches from Brentford, Saudi Arabian side Al-Ahli, Los Angeles FC, Fenerbahce and Bayer Leverkusen in recent weeks. Forest are a club on the up, which is new territory for Postecoglou; usually he takes over teams in decline. Last season, they placed seventh, their best finish in 30 years, and will play in the Europa League despite qualifying for the Conference League due to a convoluted ruling around Crystal Palace and multi-club ownership.\n\nBut there\u2019s work ahead that fits his brief. Marinakis says he wants Postecoglou\u2019s help to \u201cbuild something special\u201d, to take Forest from just another Premier League into one that wins things, and does so in style. Postecoglou, like Clough, offers something different: the courage to be stupid. The difficulty will be the abrupt shift from Espirito Santo\u2019s conservative, ball-allergic counter-attacking style towards Postecoglou\u2019s expansive, attacking modus operandi. But that\u2019s not exactly an unfamiliar challenge; Espirito Santo was one of the succession of unsuccessful Spurs managers whose templates Postecoglou was brought in to rip apart. Loading Forest\u2019s squad, while largely geared towards Nunoball, has plenty of talent capable of playing on the front foot, like Morgan Gibbs-White, the English international who Spurs somehow failed to sign; Callum Hudson-Odoi, Omari Hutchinson and Dan Ndoye, three exciting, explosive wingers; new signing Douglas Luiz, an all-round excellent midfielder; and full-backs Ola Aina and Neco Williams, who look like perfect fits for a system that asks them to invert.\n\nThere are certainly some pieces that might not fit as perfectly. Kiwi striker Chris Wood, for instance, might not have it in him to press as incessantly at Postecoglou likes his forwards to do. Defenders Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic might not enjoy walking the tightrope on the halfway line. Though the transfer window has just shut, there\u2019s scope to make any necessary changes in January and beyond. Unlike former Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, Marinakis doesn\u2019t dilly-dally on the transfer market. If there\u2019s a player he wants, he goes and gets them. Loading Forest\u2019s squad is big, too, with second and in some instances third-choice options available in almost every position, which makes them better prepared to compete in multiple competitions than Spurs were last season. The jokes at Postecoglou\u2019s expense were being cracked before his announcement was even confirmed. He always wins things in his second season - so he\u2019ll get them relegated and win next season\u2019s English Championship title, then. When Aina went off hurt after just 10 minutes of action for Nigeria on Wednesday morning (AEST), Postecoglou was instantly blamed, and the myth of his apparently hapless training methods was immediately raised. The doubters are out in force already, the narrative arc set. However, what they overlook is that Postecoglou will be a better manager due to his Tottenham experience. He says he takes away something new from every training session, much less every job. Those who say he can\u2019t \u201cadapt\u201d overlook that not only has he successfully adapted to football in four different countries now, but he even adapted at Spurs; the way they played in the Europa League was almost the antithesis of the singular way he is alleged to be dogmatically wedded to.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The bitter rivalry between Touk Miller and Dayne Zorko has defined the ferocity of their derby clashes for seven years, as the pair prepare to face off in the most crucial battle in Queensland\u2019s AFL history. In the Gold Coast Suns\u2019 fledgling days, when the QClash struggled for relevancy in a state dominated by rugby league, the on-field feud between the two competitors helped ignite a genuine intrastate rivalry. Their history dates back to early 2018, when Miller held his Brisbane Lions\u2019 rival to just 10 touches while finishing with 21 disposals of his own to win the second of his four Marcus Ashcroft Medals \u2013 the award for the best player on ground in the Queensland derby. The midfielder patted Zorko on the back and offered a handshake, which the latter refused. When they met later that year, their battle was bruising, with Zorko gaining the upper hand in a tight Lions win. Brisbane\u2019s veteran was spotted laughing at Miller as he extended his hand. The tension escalated further in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being cleared by the match review officer in round 20 of that season, an AFL investigation led to Miller receiving a one-game suspension for \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d after contacting Zorko\u2019s groin in a tackle. Miller, now 29, admitted he harboured hatred for the defending premiers yet could not help but praise his nemesis. Loading \u201c[Zorko\u2019s] a fantastic player \u2013 I respect the way he goes about it on the field \u2013 and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to clash at some point,\u201d Miller said, as his Suns prepared for a semi-final showdown with Brisbane. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably spark a bit of crowd noise, but it just adds to the fuel for the rivalry. \u201cIn games like this, you separate yourself from what\u2019s been said in the past. \u201cWe probably haven\u2019t gone at it for quite some time now, to be really honest with you. That patch where we did have a good two- or three-year span, I was tagging him for quite some time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the past 15 years, only competition points had been at stake between the two sides. Now, a preliminary final beckons. The Lions seek retribution for their Geelong humbling, while the Suns aim to mark their maiden finals foray with a deep September run after their one-point triumph over Fremantle. Has Dayne Zorko\u2019s shift to the backline all but ended his battles with Touk Miller? We will find out on Saturday. Credit: via Getty Images Suns legend Gary Ablett Junior said with a laugh that he was \u201cnot going to add\u201d to the notion the Miller-Zorko rivalry could rear again, but he warned the most composed outfit would emerge victorious. \u201cTouk\u2019s a competitor, and so is Zorko \u2013 they\u2019re the type of guys you want on your team. They want to win,\u201d Ablett Jnr said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading \u201cI\u2019m a big believer it doesn\u2019t matter what game you\u2019re playing in \u2013 whether it be regular season games or finals \u2013 you need to be preparing the same way. \u201cThat\u2019s always the challenge, making sure the players are preparing the way they normally would \u2026 and then when you get into the game, you\u2019ve got to stay composed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to play instinctive footy and read the game.\u201d Levi Ashcroft will have the chance to step up in Lachie Neale\u2019s absence. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images A hamstring injury kept Miller sidelined when the Suns last faced the Lions \u2013 a 66-point Gold Coast demolition masterminded by Matt Rowell (37 disposals, 15 clearances). But Miller is ready to rise again on Saturday. While the Suns have won just eight of 29 QClashes, he has averaged 21.12 disposals, 4.82 clearances and 5.24 tackles from 17 games, while kicking seven goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRivalries probably always bring out the best in most people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for long enough to learn that every time we get a chance to have a go at them, I\u2019m always going to try my best to get us the win.\u201d The midfield battle could well decide this contest, where rookie Levi Ashcroft has been tipped to join brother Will Ashcroft, Josh Dunkley and Hugh McCluggage in filling the void left by Lachie Neale\u2019s season-ending calf injury. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a massive void, but we\u2019re confident in our youth,\u201d Dunkley said. \u201cLevi Ashcroft plays on the wing, I\u2019ve talked about him being really selfless and one of the guys who will put his hand up this week to take that role. \u201cWhoever fills the void will do a good job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: Michael Dahlstrom\n\nWhen an old washing machine or fridge becomes too worn down to be sold on Facebook Marketplace, the only option for most Aussies is to dump it on the nature strip for the council pickup. But a group of Sydney councils is warning only 57 per cent of the materials in large household appliances are being recycled, and the city is expected to run out of landfill in just five years.\n\nThe solution could involve asking manufacturers to pay a levy on each product they produce, a project run by the Southern Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (SSROC) and the Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence has suggested.\n\nModelling by the groups found that an average of $37 per appliance would help cover the cost of collection and recycling. To \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the chances of the product being repaired and components being recovered, that figure would have to increase to $49.\n\nThe levy was proposed during a project on product stewardship funded by the NSW Environment Protection Authority.

Composite materials like wires coated in plastic, heat pumps and ozone-depleting gases in fridges were noted as being particularly challenging to process.\n\nProduct Stewardship Centre of Excellence director John Gertsakis said a well-regulated program to ensure more whitegoods were recycled or repaired was \u201cwell overdue\u201d in Australia. He noted that manufacturers in the European Union are already required to fund product stewardship schemes.\n\nDuring the talks, interviews were conducted with manufacturers, and they generally supported a scheme to improve stewardship as long as industry was involved in its design.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
