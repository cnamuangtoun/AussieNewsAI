    "text": "Disease resistance to antibiotics is rising faster than \ufeffmedical advances can keep up with, potentially putting billions around the world in danger.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\ufeff's Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report found that one in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections that caused common conditions in people worldwide in 2023, were resistant to antibiotic treatments.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2023, the report found antibiotic resistance in people rose 40 per cent, or 5 to 15 per cent each year.\ufeff\n\nAntibiotic resistance is riding around the world. (Getty)\n\nAnita Williams, from the Centre for Child Health Research at the University of Western Australia, said the findings were \"alarming but not surprising\".\n\n\"Thankfully, the proportion of resistance in Australian children is lower than global averages,\" she said.\n\n\"Whilst globally 45 per cent of E coli were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, in Australian children it was only 21.5 per cent. For methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA), globally it was 27.1 per cent, whilst in Australian children it was 13.6 per cent.\"\n\nWithout effective antibiotics, even routine surgeries could become extremely risky. (Getty)\n\nHowever, she said, antibiotic resistance from bacteria in children was nonetheless on the rise in the country.\ufeff\n\nProfessor Mark Blaskovich from the Institute for Molecular Bioscience said that the nearby South East Asia region had one of the highest levels of resistance at 31 per cent, which posed a potential danger of transmission to travellers.\n\n\"Particularly worrying is the finding that some of our more powerful antibiotics are being used more widely than they should be, meaning that resistance to these important antibiotics will continue to develop more quickly than it should, leading to their obsolescence,\" he said.\n\nResistance from bacteria that cause diseases like E coli is increasing. (Getty)\n\n\"This leads to the need for new antibiotics, but as outlined in another recent WHO report, the development pipeline for new antibacterial agents is sparsely populated.\n\n\"While Australia is doing relatively well compared to the rest of the world, it must not be complacent and should commit to funding research that combats antibiotic resistance.\"\n\nMultiple experts noted that in countries with weaker health systems - usually poorer countries - the problem was, but that the current hyper-connectivity of the world meant transmission of resistant bacteria could happen very easily.\n\n\"Because about five million deaths were associated with antimicrobial resistance (not just antibiotics, but also antivirals and antifungals),\" Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake from The Australian National University said.\n\n\"By 2050, this could reach 10 million deaths a year and have a negative impact on global GDP with global losses of US$100 trillion ($153.4 trillion).\"\n\nHe and others rejected the idea that tightening prescription requirements for antibiotics was a catch-all solution\ufeff.\n\n\"It is not just an issue of doctors prescribing antibiotics inappropriately. Instead, it also includes the vast spectrum of antimicrobial use not just in humans, but also in animals and plants, the use of the unprescribed over-the-counter antibiotics, the contamination of waterways with antibiotics, and the development of new antibiotics,\" he said.\n\n\"Developing new antibiotics, however, is not cost-effective for businesses, so they require healthy government subsidies to make it attractive for pharmaceutical companies.\ufeff\"\n\nPeople can help prevent bacterial spread through simple acts like washing their hands. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nReece Pharmaceuticals chief executive James Graham said most antibiotic classes had been discovered between the 1940s and 1980s.\n\n\"This innovation gap is colliding with escalating global resistance, leaving doctors with fewer options and patients at greater risk,\" he said.\n\n\"Infections that were once easily treated now mean longer hospital stays, higher treatment costs, and, in some cases, preventable amputations such as those seen in diabetic foot infections.\ufeff\"\n\nAssociate Professor Andreea Molnar from Swinburne University of Technology laid out the problem starkly, saying without effective antibiotics, even \"routine\" surgeries were \"dangerously risky\".\n\nWhile multiple experts are calling for better surveillance and increased incentives from government, Dr Trent Yarwood of the \ufeffAustralasian Society for Infectious Diseases, said everybody had a part to play.\n\n\"Prevent infections by washing your hands, getting vaccinated and practising good food safety,\" he said.\n\n\"Only take antibiotics when they are necessary and only for as long as is recommended by your doctor.\"",

(ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nBut an auditor-general report tabled in parliament on Tuesday found the hydrogen office \u2014 which was dissolved in May \u2014 has spent $285.2 million over three years.\n\nThis includes capital costs of $209.2 million, with the agency writing off $85.7 million of that because it related to early works on designing hydrogen production and storage in Whyalla.\n\n\"This accounting treatment recognises that there is insufficient certainty that economic benefits will flow to the state,\" the auditor-general report states.\n\nThe office also incurred $53.4 million in operating expenses and $12.5 million for the purchase of land at Whyalla.\n\nThe hydrogen power plant had been proposed for Whyalla. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\nThe state opposition said the report showed the \"eye watering amount of money that Labor has gambled and lost on its hydrogen fantasy\".\n\n\"The Office of Hydrogen Power spent over $285 million in just three years in its existence on their hydrogen power plant that's now destined for the scrap heap,\" shadow energy spokesperson Stephen Patterson said.\n\nMr Patterson said the government could not argue that its $593 million allocated to the hydrogen plant was being transferred to the Whyalla steelworks.\n\n\"In fact, a big chunk of this money is not going to be recovered,\" he said.\n\nStephen Patterson says a \"big chunk\" of the money will not be recovered. (ABC News)\n\nBut the government said it will recoup much of its spending by selling the four gas turbines it purchased for the hydrogen plant.\n\nEnergy and Mining Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the 200-megawatt generator will provide additional generation capacity for the state when it is in private hands.\n\n\"We're buying generators, and those generators have a cost, and what you're seeing reflected in the auditor-general's report is the rough cost estimates of the generators,\" he said.\n\n\"Without wanting to prejudice any potential sale process, obviously the generators have a value, they're an asset that the government will hold.\"\n\nAsked if the sale of the generators would recoup the full $285 million spent by the hydrogen office, Mr Koutsantonis said: \"I would suspect that we'll do exceptionally well given the wait for generators and the demand for these generators globally\".\n\nTom Koutsantonis says the government will recoup much of its spending by selling gas turbines it purchased for the hydrogen plant. (ABC News: Ashlin Blieschke)\n\n'We have the intellectual property'\n\nThe Department for Energy and Mining, which took over responsibility for hydrogen in May, told the auditor-general the sales process for the turbines opened in early August.\n\nIt also advised the auditor-general that it intends to \"recoup the original purchase price\" in the sale.\n\nRegarding the $85.7 million deemed to have \"no immediate future economic benefit\", Mr Koutsantonis said this impairment was \"an accounting standard for projects that have been cancelled\".\n\n\"When you buy infrastructure or you procure reports or you do engineering studies or you do works that might be used for other purposes \u2014 but not for the specific purpose \u2014 the auditor-general \u2026 requires that that become an impairment,\" he said.\n\nTom Koutsantonis says infrastructure acquired for the hydrogen plant could still be used. (ABC News: Justin Hewitson)\n\nHe cited the Port Dock rail extension project as an example.\n\nThe $16.4 million rail extension project was started by the Weatherill government in 2017 and scrapped by the Marshall government in 2019.\n\nThe Malinauskas government restarted the project in 2022 for a cost of more than $50 million, and Mr Koutsantonis said the government was able to use sleepers and rail lines that were acquired before the project was shelved.\n\nHe said the infrastructure acquired for the hydrogen plant, including substations and transmission lines, could still be used.\n\n\"All the studies that we've done as part of the hydrogen jobs plan to get a generator operational can absolutely be used, we have the intellectual property over all that work,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of it is for infrastructure that can be used for other projects as well.\"",

However, some operations appear to be having less success with the new tech than others.\n\nUS Attorney Joseph Nocella called it \"one of the largest investment fraud operations in history\".\n\nProsecutors said that at one point Mr Chen bragged that the so-called \"pig-butchering\" scam was pulling in $46m a day.\n\nThe have accused Mr Chen of sanctioning violence against workers, authorising bribes to foreign officials and using his other businesses, such as online gambling and cryptocurrency mining, to launder illicit profits.\n\nMr Chen was the \"mastermind behind a sprawling cyber-fraud empire,\" Assistant Attorney-General John Eisenberg alleged.\n\nThe 38-year-old has been charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy offences.\n\nClaims of forced labour in compounds\n\nAccording to Mr Chen's indictment, Prince Holding Group built at least 10 compounds in Cambodia.\n\nWorkers \u2013 often migrants held against their will \u2013 were forced to contact thousands of victims through social media or online messaging platforms, build rapport and entice them to transfer cryptocurrency with hopes of big investment returns, the indictment said.\n\nScams are often run out of walled compounds such as this one that was raided by Cambodian authorities in 2022. (Reuters: Cindy Liu)\n\nProsecutors said the money was funnelled into other Prince Holding Group businesses and shell companies and used to pay for travel and entertainment, watches, holiday homes, rare artwork and a Rolex watch for an executive's spouse.\n\nOne victim was scammed out of more than $617,000 in cryptocurrency, prosecutors said.\n\nScam centres pop up on Australia's doorstep As scam centres run by organised crime find it harder to operate in South-East Asia, evidence emerges of them moving into the Pacific and setting up lucrative operations estimated to net billions each year.\n\nThe compounds allegedly functioned as forced labour camps and had dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed-wire fences.\n\nInside the compounds, automated call centres used hundreds of mobile phones lined up on racks controlling tens of thousands of fake social media profiles, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to the treasury department's sanctions statement, workers at the compounds were held captive, isolated and sometimes beaten after being lured with the promise of high-paying jobs in fields such as customer service or tech support.\n\nPhotographs included in Mr Chen's indictment showed a man with a bloody gash on his face, dozens of men on the ground with their hands bound, and a man with red lash marks on his chest and arms.\n\nMr Chen allegedly personally approved of at least one beating, which involved a man believed to be causing trouble at a compound, but cautioned that he not be \"beaten to death\".\n\nIn 2023, the United Nations estimated about 100,000 people were being forced to carry out online scams in Cambodia, as well as at least 120,000 in Myanmar and tens of thousands in Thailand, Laos and the Philippines.\n\nAlleged victims could be repaid\n\nMr Chen, a native of China who is also known as \"Vincent,\" remained at large as of Tuesday, according to prosecutors.\n\nHe faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted over the US charges.\n\nThe US could use the 127,271 bitcoins it seized to repay victims if the court approves such a course of action.\n\nUS and British authorities have also imposed sanctions on Mr Chen's company, which is involved in real estate development and financial services.\n\nThe US Treasury Department has declared it a transnational criminal organisation.\n\nChinese authorities have been investigating the company for cyber scams and money laundering since as early as 2020, according to court records reviewed by the US Institute of Peace.\n\nCambodian government arrests more than 1,000 people in cybercrime raids A crackdown by Cambodian authorities on cybercrime has led to more than 1,000 arrests.\n\nJacob Daniel Sims, a transnational crime expert and visiting fellow at Harvard University's Asia Center, described Prince Holding Group as \"an essential part of the scaffolding that makes global cyber-scamming possible\".\n\nHe said Mr Chen was a \"central pillar\" of the criminal economy intertwined with Cambodia's ruling regime.\n\nMr Chen has served as an adviser to Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father, former prime minister Hun Sen, and was honoured with the title \"neak oknha\" \u2014 the equivalent to an English lord.\n\n\"While the indictment and sanctions don't instantly dismantle these networks, they fundamentally change the risk calculus,\" Mr Sims said.\n\nThey make \"every global bank, real estate firm and investor think twice before touching Cambodian elite money\".\n\nLast year the US and UK imposed sanctions on Ly Yong Phat, one of Cambodia's richest men and a leading member of the ruling Cambodian People's Party, after he was implicated in allegations of forced labour, human trafficking and online scams.\n\nABC/Wires",

(ABC News: Peter Healy)\n\nVictorian Ambulance Union secretary Danny Hill said graduates who languish on the jobs waiting list were unable to keep their skills up-to-date.\n\n\"It would be helpful if the likelihood of actually getting employment in [Victoria] was communicated to them earlier because often, they tell us that they weren't told they only take on 300 graduates a year,\" Mr Hill said.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Victoria University said it was open with students about employment opportunities.\n\nAmbulance Victoria only took on 134 graduate paramedics in the 2023-2024 financial year, but roughly 800 students graduate each year. (ABC News: Margaret Burin)\n\nThe regional retention problem\n\nMr Hill said another issue with Ambulance Victoria's current recruitment policy was staff retention.\n\nHe said recruiting regional people to work in regional locations led to improved staff retention rates in rural areas.\n\n\"Straightaway as soon as a person who's grown up in Melbourne and lives in Melbourne is sent to a remote area, they want to [return to the city] so they put themselves down on a preference list to try and move and then they eventually get a transfer and then they have to re-recruit [for the regions],\" Mr Hill said.\n\nMr Hill said he would welcome moves to train more people who have worked as ambulance community officers in regional areas to become local paramedics.\n\n\"It's better to find people that will actually work in those locations \u2014 it makes much more sense to do that rather than have someone come in from interstate,\" he said.\n\nJoey said his local experience had given him intimate knowledge of how to deal with emergency situations in his rural town.\n\n\"You already understand the lay of the land, you know where to go and where other crews are coming from,\" he said.\n\n\"The way we work in rural communities can sometimes be looked at as a lifestyle, so if you don't want to do the lifestyle necessarily and you just want it to be a job, then you can just find another branch.\n\n\"I got to return back to where I kind of started and I'm still here three years later, which is nice.\"",

    "text": "Residents in the Shire of Coolgardie say they are happy that local government elections will go ahead this week, but frustrations remain about how the embattled regional council has arrived at this point.\n\nWestern Australian Local Government Minister Hannah Beazley yesterday announced she would not suspend Coolgardie's council, almost two months after issuing a show-cause notice to the shire.\n\nMs Beazley yesterday branded the financial situation at the debt-laden shire as \"unprecedented in the history of this state\".\n\nDespite this, she granted the shire's leadership a further 12 months to \"get their house in order\".\n\nMs Beazely told a busy community meeting that the council would not be suspended, and would be given 12 months to improve its situation. (ABC Golfields: Macey Turner )\n\nWhile the minister's announcement was met with cautious applause during a community meeting held in Coolgardie, concerns were expressed about how the shire would return to a financially stable position\n\nLong-term resident Jan McLeod, from Widgiemooltha, said she was disappointed with the lack of community engagement during the past year.\n\nShire of Coolgardie resident Jan McLeod says she is glad the local election will go ahead. (ABC Goldfields: Macey Turner )\n\n\"They have not involved the community, they have not asked us, and that is what the community needs,\" she said.\n\nShe said community members had been raising concerns for years before the minister intervened, and had made several attempts to escalate concerns to other agencies.\n\n\"We are not the only local government that has had this difficulty, and yet we are the one that they say is 'the worst case in Western Australia', so they should look at themselves very carefully,\" she said.\n\n\"The community had nowhere else to turn.\"\n\nShire of Coolgardie residents had mixed emotions after the council was not suspended. (ABC Goldfields: Macey Turner )\n\nMore than just financial recovery\n\nThe shire financial recovery plan showed it would be able to clear its $27.5 million debt by 2035.\n\nFollowing Ms Beazley's decision, shire president Mal Cullen said they remained confident they would prove they were on the right track in a shorter time frame.\n\nMr Cullen said the sale of their most significant asset, a workers' accommodation village, would \"go a long way\" to proving itself a financially stable shire.\n\n\"For our council and our administration, it's recognition of a lot of hard work that's gone into both the shire's position paper and the financial recovery plan over the past four or five months,\" he said.\n\nMal Cullen and Aaron Cook at a council meeting in September 2025. (ABC Goldfields: Macey Turner )\n\nBut Mr Cullen said stability was not just about clearing debt.\n\nHe hoped that repaying creditors would also rebuild trust.\n\n\"There's certainly a fair bit of concern from a fair few residents, and that's part and parcel of the rebuilding of those relationships with the community,\" he said.\n\nPush for voters\n\nOn a positive note, Ms Beazley said voter turnout for Coolgardie's election this weekend was expected to exceed the state average.\n\nVoting is not compulsory in Western Australian local government elections, though strongly encouraged. Elector participation across all WA local government elections sat at 31.2 per cent in 2023, according to the WA Electoral Commission. Coolgardie recorded a 31.9 per cent participation rate at that election.\n\nBut in the lead-up to Saturday's ballot, Coolgardie resident and council candidate Paul Wilcox said there was a noticeable reluctance to vote due to the uncertainty with the shire.\n\nCouncil candidate Paul Wilcox says he believes the uncertainty regarding Coolgardie's future has deterred people from voting. (ABC Goldfields: Macey Turner )\n\n\"[There's been] a bit of reluctance to get involved because people are asking questions if there's any point in voting,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm hoping even though we've only got five or six days to go, that this gives more of a push for people who were thinking about voting to get out there and vote.\"\n\nBuck stops at the council\n\nCurrent councillors at a meeting in September 2025. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Macey Turner.)\n\nMs Beazley hoped that upcoming reforms to the Local Government Act would bring more accountability to the sector.\n\nThis includes the appointment of a local government inspector from January next year. The inspector will have greater powers to investigate and intervene in local government conduct issues.\n\nMs Beazley said while she had frustrations with \"threshold\" limitations imposed by the Local Government Act, it was ultimately the council's responsibility to ensure proper financial oversight.\n\n\"It should not take this level of state government intervention for council to act responsibly,\" she said.",

Contact Antonia O'Flaherty at Oflaherty.Antonia@abc.net.au or on antoniaoflaherty@protonmail.com\n\nThe minister did not say whether he alerted other members of government to the issue, but that he asked the health department's director general to determine whether the issue would impact other patients.\n\nBy \"late September\" Metro North Health became aware it was a systemic issue at the outpatient service, initially believing the imaging results of up to 9,000 patients may not have been seen by doctors.\n\nThe number of patients involved has since increased to 12,529.\n\nAfter the issues were revealed by the ABC, Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the government had only been briefed on the issue on September 29.\n\nThe health minister was on leave from September 19, returning on October 13.\n\nHealth minister says he ordered internal investigation\n\nMr Nicholls was asked in state parliament during Question Time whether he knew about the failures at the health service before he went on leave.\n\nMr Nicholls said when he became aware of the first case at Caboolture Hospital, he directed Queensland Health director-general David Rosengren to \"carry out a thorough investigation\" before he went on leave.\n\n\"So yes I was aware of the one case, and yes I discussed it with the director-general, and yes with the director-general we were concerned about the failures,\" he said.\n\nHealth minister Tim Nicholls. (ABC News: Chris Gillette)\n\n\"And yes we directed metro [north] health and their director of medical services to undertake a full scan and that is the appropriate way to go, we are a responsible government.\"\n\nThe minister told the ABC his office was first alerted to the extent of the issue on September 29.\n\nIn a statement, the Opposition leader Steven Miles said the health minister should not have \"jetted overseas\" after being told about the \"major issue\" at Caboolture Hospital.\n\n\"This is not a health bungle, this is a blatant failure of leadership, of ministerial responsibilities and of accountability\".\n\nThe problem with medical scan results going unchecked at the outpatient service only became public after the ABC sent questions to Metro North Health on September 29.\n\nQueensland hospital investigation Queensland Health will investigate reports patients did not receive crucial test results from Townsville hospital.\n\nIn the statement that day Metro North Health told the ABC that the issue was identified \"early in September\" and described it as \"a gap\" in how medical imaging results were distributed within its Specialist Outpatients department.\n\nThe following day Metro North Health chief medical officer Elizabeth Rushbrook told media the health service became aware that it was a systemic issue by \"late September\" but did not provide specific dates.\n\nThe problem stemmed from an internal change to process in April 2023, which meant paper copies of imaging results may not have been given to clinicians, and the hospital couldn\u2019t be sure that electronic results were checked either.\n\nPremier insists acting minister doing an 'excellent job'\n\nAt a media conference on September 30, Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the government had only been briefed on the extent of the issue the day before.\n\n\"I've asked the health and hospital network to talk to Queenslanders today.\n\n\"I have this view that where information comes to light, it has to be shared, particularly where it impacts an individual,\" he said at the press conference.\n\nDuring the same week, it also emerged that at Townsville's urology department some patients, some of whom have cancer, had not received test results or follow-up care, with Queensland Health launching a Part 9 investigation into the matter on September 29.\n\nWhen asked if the health minister should return from leave, Mr Crisafulli said the acting minister, Dale Last, was doing an \"excellent job\".\n\nMetro North Health said only patients who had imaging at the specialist outpatient service between April 1 2023 and September 4 2025 are affected and concerned patients can call the hospital on 07 5316 5163.",

    "text": "\u201cWe are more like a medical item than a fashion piece,\u201d says Jochen Gutzy, Birkenstock chief communications officer. \u201cAs our chief executive says, \u2018we\u2019re like aspirin for the feet\u2019.\u201d Fashion is a relative newcomer to the Birkenstock business, with supermodel Heidi Klum launching their first official fashion collaboration in 2003. But the brand\u2019s medical history runs far deeper than Klum\u2019s noughties denim designs. Loading The footwear company\u2019s journey began in 1774, with German shoemaker Johann Birkenstock. It picks up pace in 1897 with great-grandson Konrad Birkenstock and his fixation on orthopaedic shoe lasts. That foot-health fixation remains, outlasting a series of Carls and Karls in the family, which gave up control of the business in 2012. It has even survived an IPO in 2023, when the company was valued at up to $US8.3 billion ($12.8 billion).\n\n\u201cWalking is like breathing and drinking water, and the footbeds are the ingredient that the human being needs for healthy living,\u201d Gutzy says. \u201cWe care about people\u2019s health and wellbeing. Now I think fashion is looking for the real thing because the consumers are better informed.\u201d Birkenstocks being assembled at the company\u2019s German factory in G\u00f6rlitz. While Gutzy is happy with growing sales to fashion consumers, the business is not chasing collaborations, having declined potentially lucrative partnerships with former Louis Vuitton creative director Marc Jacobs, streetwear giant Supreme and Guram Gvasalia\u2019s French fashion brand Vetements. A year after Louis Vuitton said yes to a partnership with Supreme in 2017, which was greeted with fanfare by Vogue and GQ, Birkenstock said no.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no benefit for us except prostitution because this is just prostitution,\u201d Reichert told The Cut. Marc Jacobs unofficially adapted Birkenstocks for the runway for his seminal grunge spring 1993 collection for Perry Ellis. More recently, when Jacobs approached Birkenstock with sketches for an official collaboration, it was time to raise the red flag, again, Gutzy says. \u201cWe said \u2018thank you, but no\u2019 because the ideas that he had in mind for the outsole... it might get some attention out there, but from an orthopedic standpoint, it\u2019s wrong, so let\u2019s not do it. \u201cWe feel comfortable with what we\u2019re doing. When I joined the company in 2012, we produced 12.3 million pairs. Now we are sitting [at] around 40 million. We plan on doubling that capacity in the coming years.\u201d At Birkenstock factories outside the picturesque German town of G\u00f6rlitz, automated machines are being introduced alongside the 1900 workers supervising the production of cork innersoles, the cutting of leather and precise placement of buckles.\n\nDuring a workshop, where I designed my own pair of sandals (sorry Supreme and Marc Jacobs) I learnt that it\u2019s pronounced Birken-sh-tock. Say the name correctly and no one will question your decision to wear sandals with socks. An off-duty Gigi Hadid in New York. Right: Birkenstock \u201cBoston Big Buckle\u201d clogs. Birkenstock manufactures 95 per cent of its shoes in Germany, and has a factory outpost in Portugal. Last month the company said it had bought a facility near Dresden to further increase its manufacturing capacity. Entrepreneur Margot Fraser distributed the shoes through Californian health food stores in the \u201960s, cementing their hippie reputation for crunchy granola feet. The US is still crucial to the brand\u2019s success. In Australia, Marcel Goerke pioneered an appetite for the footwear, challenging the supremacy of the thong as summer footwear in 1992, with a catalogue aimed at the local market. In 1993 Birkenstock opened its first store in Melbourne. Sydney had to wait until 2024.\n\nLoading \u201cMarcel was raised in a family that distributed Birkenstock shoes over the span of three generations and then moved to Australia,\u201d says Gutzy. \u201cAustralian consumers understand the product. It\u2019s one of the markets with the highest per capita usage of Birkenstock products worldwide.\u201d In the \u201990s Goerke noticed that Birkenstocks wore down more quickly in Australia than in Germany, and pushed a repairs program. Last year more than 5000 pairs were repaired in Australia. \u201cThey are designed to be repaired,\u201d Gutzy says. Having found their feet in the world of fashion, Birkenstock has one more obstacle to face.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Harry Enfield, legendary British comedian, pioneering 1990s satirist, is sitting in a small, brightly lit London kitchen beside a sink. It\u2019s almost a surprise. Early communications from his people suggested Enfield would only be interviewed about his upcoming Australian tour, Harry Enfield: And No Chums, if he did it as one of his famous comedy characters. Cash-waving Cockney loudmouth Loadsamoney perhaps. Or maybe well-bred fool Tim Nice-But-Dim Esq, or cheesy radio DJ Dave \u201cNicey\u201d Nice (my vote). All part of the cavalcade of characters he played in BBC TV shows that made Enfield a household name in Britain from the 1980s onwards. But here is the real Enfield, hands clasped on top his head as he explains why there is a hammer an arm\u2019s reach away on the sink top. \u201cWell, one of my people is sitting here shaking his head and giggling,\u201d Enfield says of a confidant just beyond the laptop\u2019s screen. \u201cOne has to discipline one\u2019s people sometimes, right?\u201d In the 1990s, more than 10 million people tuned in to watch Enfield\u2019s sketch TV shows, from Harry Enfield\u2019s Television Programme to Harry Enfield & Chums and Harry & Paul, the latter adding his longtime collaborator Paul Whitehouse to the title. Harry Enfield as his character Kevin the Teenager. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo Enfield was already famous in late-1980s Britain for TV appearances as Greek kebab-shop owner character Stavros and Loadsamoney, the bravado-infused figure satirising prime minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s ideology and politics. When Enfield got his own show, a plethora of comedy guises and double acts was unleashed, ranging from clueless upper-class twit Tim Nice-But-Dim Esq, working-class caricatures Wayne and Waynetta Slob, witless young Conservative Tory Boy and cheesy radio DJs Smashie and Nicey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch was the fame of Enfield\u2019s recalcitrant adolescent character Kevin the Teenager, he and best friend Perry, played by actor, director and regular collaborator Kathy Burke, got their own feature film, Kevin & Perry Go Large, in 2000. The movie\u2019s promotional tour 25 years ago brought Enfield to Australia for the first time, although he barely saw the place. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve been there, and I just really sat in a hotel room for two days,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I went out at lunchtime, cuddled the Sydney Opera House and then ran back. That was all I did. It was nice to fondle it.\u201d Enfield\u2019s TV shows in the 1990s and 2000s were shown here, but he may be better known for The Windsors (2016-2023), a sitcom lampooning the British royal family in which Enfield played Prince Charles and then the King. His portrayal of the monarch \u2013 all furrowed brow, cuff-twiddling and starchy downturned mouth \u2013 was, he says, parody but not without empathy. That\u2019s been his approach with every character, no matter their stature. Enfield with frequent collaborator Paul Whitehouse as their characters The Old Gits. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo \u201cWhat Paul Whitehouse and Kathy Burke and I have always done is a lot of stuff that\u2019s full of truth,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Kevin the Teenager, everyone has teenagers, they know that kind of thing, but it\u2019s always nice, it\u2019s never nasty. It might be mischievous, but it\u2019s never malicious. And I think that\u2019s what people like really. Or most people.\u201d Enfield, who rarely gives interviews and eschews celebrity status, is segmenting Harry Enfield: And No Chums between character performance, talking about his career and answering questions from the audience. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m very old to be doing Kevin now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m 64. But I\u2019ll be talking about how he affects my life these days. There will be loads of characters in the show, but I\u2019ll also be talking about my life in comedy and how [comedy has] changed and also the people I\u2019ve done that I\u2019ve got into trouble for doing, maybe a little bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some characters from decades ago that he wouldn\u2019t do now. \u201cBecause things have changed a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are more wary. I\u2019m not really sure who invents the rules these days.\u201d He recalls working on satirical TV puppet show Spitting Image and voicing boxer Frank Bruno, a casting that wouldn\u2019t happen today. He\u2019s not certain Women, Know Your Limits!, his satire about misogyny \u2013 presented as a 1930s-style British public service announcement about the terrors of letting women think for themselves \u2013 would be allowed now either. TAKE 7: THE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO HARRY ENFIELD Worst habit? Some might say I\u2019m big-headed. Greatest fear? Losing my staggeringly good looks. The line that stayed with you? How Peter Cook described me: \u201cLauded by his equals, feared by his rivals and loathed by all and sundry.\u201d Biggest regret? I wish I had drowned my sisters. I have had to share my mummy\u2019s affections with them. Favourite book? I haven\u2019t written one about myself yet. But when I do, it\u2019ll be that. The artwork/song you wish was yours? Release The Bats by Nick Cave\u2019s Birthday Party. If you could time travel, where would you choose to go? I would travel forward 200 years. By then there will be a vast statue of me in every world metropolis. \u201cThere\u2019d probably be a lot of people saying you\u2019re perpetuating stereotypes,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is rubbish, obviously, but that\u2019s just an example. In fact, a few years ago, I went on this yoga week and there was this German woman who was very sweet but kept on frowning at me. \u201cI thought, oh, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done. And then one day, she came up and said, \u2018I\u2019ve realised who you are. You\u2019re Women, Know Your Limits!\u2019 She was a professor in gender studies, and she said every year, the first thing she shows her new students is that sketch, and then they start from there. That was lovely, you know? Pretty much everything I do is that kind of thing.\u201d Enfield\u2019s era of TV crammed with sketch comedy shows is over. Drama wins over comedy, he says, in terms of funding. He\u2019s pleased to see David Mitchell and Robert Webb have a new TV sketch show, Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping, but equally cheered by the diversity and number of people making new comedy online. \u201cThere are more people frightened of more things nowadays and more people frightened of offending anyone,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, people who want to be offended are always going to be offended. As I say, my thing is mischief, not malice. Some people will find that offensive because they\u2019ve got a fixed view of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and they don\u2019t really have a sense of humour about things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnfield is a big fan of Australian comedian Sam Campbell and British poet, comedian and actor Tim Key, and is regularly taken to see new comedians by his adult children. He and Whitehouse get together as much as possible. \u201cHe\u2019s the loveliest man,\u201d Enfield says. \u201cI once upset Richard Curtis. He said to me, \u2018I\u2019m still trying to get over when you said I\u2019m the second-nicest man in the world after Paul Whitehouse.\u2019\u201d What does he think of fans from the other side of the globe, in a place he visited once 25 years, wanting to see his show? Enfield may be part of a steady groundswell of tours by comics of his generation \u2013 Ben Elton, Tony Robinson, Alan Davies, Eddie Izzard, Bill Bailey to name a few \u2013 but their TV and live shows are perhaps better known here. Loading \u201cDo you mean I\u2019m culty?\u201d Enfield says, leaning forward with a quizzical smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never been culty over here, I\u2019ve just been on the telly. So, I like being a cult. That\u2019s good.\u201d He is greatly looking forward to being in Australia again, although his friend Elton, a longtime Australian resident, will be away. \u201cI\u2019m coming to talk to everyone about everything,\u201d he says. \u201cIncluding meeting Camilla in real life.\u201d What was that like? \u201cIt was cool,\u201d Enfield says. \u201cShe was very nice. I sat next her in church, and we had a little chat. I didn\u2019t tell her some of the nastier things \u2026 not nasty, but some of the silly and naughty things that we\u2019ve done [about her].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

And also the identification of the people to make sure as soon as possible. And what we also see as top priority at the moment it is about aid coming to the people. It is very important that in addition to the emergency aid that will be in the trucks, there is also materials to allow the key actors to rebuild these infrastructures.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities say the triple zero system in Victoria is back to normal after an early morning power outage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outage took out the computer-aided dispatch system at around 12.30am, forcing emergency call operators to revert to pen and paper to record information.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system was down for a number of hours before gradually coming back online.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian government says the incident is being thoroughly investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut opposition leader Brad Battin says the outage is a symptom of a much larger problem with the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen this too often, and we saw the results and outcomes in the past. When they ended up doing a review it came up with the conclusions of how you could fix triple zero.

After a prolonged and courageous battle with cancer, we are heartbroken to announce that Michael D'Angelo Archer, known to his fans around the world as D'Angelo, has been called home,\" his family said in a statement to Variety.\n\n\n\nMusician D'Angelo won plaudits for albums including his 1995 debut Brown Sugar and Voodoo, released in 2000.

    "text": "Venezuela's government has announced it will be closing its embassies in Australia and Norway in a restructuring of its foreign service, as tensions escalate between the South American country and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe closures are part of the \"strategic re-assignation of resources\", President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Venezuelan government said consular services to Venezuelans in Norway and Australia will be provided by diplomatic missions, with details to be shared in the coming days.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenezuela has also announced it will be opening new embassies in Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe, which it described as \"two sister nations, strategic allies in the anti-colonial fight and in the resistance against hegemonic pressures\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth countries have governments that are aligned with Russia, which recently expressed support for Venezuela at the United Nations while criticising the US .\n\n\n\n\n\nRaul Sanchez-Urribarri, an associate professor from the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at La Trobe University, called Venezuela's decision to close its embassy in Australia a \"strong disappointment\" and said he is concerned about the lack of consular services for Venezuelans in Australia.\n\n\n\nSanchez-Urribarri said he was first made aware of the news that the embassy would be closing after a friend reached out to him asking how he would renew his passport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Venezuelan population in Australia is not terribly big, but it's still significant,\" Sanchez-Urribarri said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's calculated at about 10,000 to 15,000 Venezuelans who use those services, and Australia being so distant from other locations, then there is concern that by shutting down the consular services, it will be hard for Venezuelans to avail themselves of those services if they're moved to another location.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLuis Patino, the vice president of the Venezuelan Community of South Australia, told SBS News he was not surprised the Venezuelan government chose to close its embassy in Australia as it has been changing many aspects of its foreign policy in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Patino \u2014 who moved to Australia in 2019 as a refugee \u2014 said the change makes him concerned for Venezuelans living in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a country, they're leaving all your citizens without permits and passports and any kind of documents they need to do,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatino also said visa applications for Australian citizens who want to visit their families in Venezuela could be impacted.\n\n\n\nWhy is Venezuela closing its embassy in Australia?\n\nSanchez-Urribarri said he's \"mystified\" about Venezuela's decision to close its embassy in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it may be loosely related to Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize last week for her \"tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Venezuelan opposition figure Mar\u00eda Corina Machado awarded Nobel Peace Prize\n\nIn 2023, Machado won a resounding victory in the opposition's primary election, and her rallies attracted large crowds, but a ban on holding public office prevented the democracy campaigner from running for president against Maduro in 2024, and she went into hiding.\n\n\n\n\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, announced on Friday that Machado had been awarded the prize for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSanchez-Urribarri said the award was an \"unforeseen\" development but represents a \"further dent\" in the Maduro regime's legitimacy.\n\n\n\nMar\u00eda Corina Machado won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize last week for her work fighting for democracy. Source: AAP / Matias Delacroix/AP \"It bolsters the legitimacy and the visibility for the claim for redemocratisation in Venezuela,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting on X after her win, Machado dedicated the prize \"to the suffering people of Venezuela and to [US] President [Donald] Trump for his decisive support of our cause!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize recipient is decided by the Norwegian Nobel Committee each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is independent of the Norwegian government, but the Scandinavian country said it received notice of the Venezuelan embassy closure and no reason for the decision.\n\n\n\nA Norwegian foreign ministry spokesperson said Venezuela's decision was \"regrettable\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Despite the fact that we have different views on several issues, Norway wishes to keep the dialogue with Venezuela open and will work towards that,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSanchez-Urribarri said he believes the Venezuelan government may have decided to \"lump\" the closure of the Australian embassy in with the closure of the Norwegian embassy to give the announcement more heft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nothing has happened recently [between Australia and Venezuela] that I know of that would merit that kind of reaction. In the case of Norway, I think it's quite clear \u2014 without a doubt,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"But in the case of Australia, my main hypothesis right now is that this was something that was announced for bombastic effect, but there isn't really a reason.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia's relationship with Venezuela\n\nSanchez-Urribarri said Australia doesn't have a \"functional relationship\" with Venezuela right now due to the decline of democracy and rise of authoritarianism under Maduro, who has been president since 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Australia was among several countries, including the US and the United Kingdom, along with the European Union, that recognised the former Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate president until free and fair elections were held.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Venezuelan opposition leader awarded Nobel Peace Prize SBS News 01:05 English\n\nThe validity of Maduro's presidential election and win last year was rejected by the US, European governments and 10 Latin American countries, including those with left-wing governments with strong historical ties to Venezuela.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany countries said the election was rigged and backed opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez's claim that he had won, but Gonz\u00e1lez fled Venezuela and sought asylum in Spain last September after a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\n\n\nEscalating tensions with the US\n\nTensions between the US and Venezuela have been escalating in recent months as Maduro alleges Trump is attempting to drive him from power.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has explicitly accused Maduro of leading drug cartels and called him one of the \"largest narco-traffickers in the world\", although he has played down accusations that he is seeking to oust the Venezuelan president.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September, Trump delivered the 'Major's List' to Congress \u2014 a list of 23 countries the US government says are responsible for sourcing and transporting illegal drugs into the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenezuela was listed as one of five countries the US said had \"failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts\" to stop the drug trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US also recently doubled a bounty for Maduro's arrest to US$50 million ($75 million).\n\n\n\nCarlos Eduardo Morreo, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne and Latin American studies researcher, told SBS News earlier this year that the US government is attempting to paint Venezuela as a \"narcoterrorist\" state.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Morreo said there is \"no proof really that Maduro and the government is involved in the shipments or benefits from these shipments or that the state is involved in any of these things directly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary tensions have also increased between the US and Venezuela.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US government has recently conducted fatal military strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug trafficking boats that some international experts say violate international law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has also been a significant US military build-up in the southern Caribbean, with at least seven US warships reported in the region, along with one nuclear-powered submarine and F-35 stealth fighter aircraft deployed to Puerto Rico, posing a growing threat to Maduro.\n\n\n\nThe president has called for citizens to train for a potential US attack, and the president has deployed 25,000 troops along Venezuela's coastline and its border with Colombia.\n\n\n\n\n\nSanchez-Urribarri said it is difficult to get a true sense of how Venezuelans are responding to these threats due to fear of speaking freely under the Maduro government, but he is seeing a \"strong anticipation or anxiety\" in social media comments about what will happen between Venezuela and the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a wide range of attitudes about it \u2014 from people who think something will happen any time soon to others that are in more of a 'watch and see' situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Reuters.\n\n\n\n",

It is then collated to create a digital phonebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nActing Prime Minister Richard Marles said the government was aware of the breach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've notified authorities, and that is being worked through. But obviously, there is concern,\" he told reporters on Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\nActing Prime Minister Richard Marles said authorities are looking into the breach. Source: AAP / James Ross Initial reporting by Australian website Ette Media claimed both major party leaders' details, as well as those of Marles and former prime minister Scott Morrison, were \"scraped\" by the US-based site from professional networking platforms including LinkedIn.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt prompted Ley's office to request that LinkedIn \"remove the information\" from the Opposition leader's profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is obviously concerning, and we have reached out to LinkedIn to understand what occurred here. We are waiting for their response,\" an Opposition spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn told SBS News that the third-party use of personal data is prohibited, with the platform having several measures in place to protect users.\n\n\n\n\"In addition to the technology and teams we've long had in place to stop unauthorised data scraping, we continue to invest in new defences and take legal action when necessary, to detect and prevent our members' information being used without their consent,\" a LinkedIn spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe security breach follows new data from the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), which shows 42 per cent of cyber incidents last year were the result of stolen credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency responsible for detecting and disrupting malicious cyber threats released its annual report on Tuesday, revealing a rise of 11 per cent in cyber incidents.\n\n\n\nASD director-general Abigail Bradshaw said the way cyber criminals and state actors are gaining access to organisations, critical infrastructure, and businesses is changing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Networks are increasingly not being hacked, but are being breached through compromised or stolen credentials to gain unauthorised access,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn almost half of the incidents impacting large organisations, access was gained using real usernames and passwords, often stolen or bought by cyber criminals on the dark web.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that the access is genuine, instead of a hack, it is harder to track.\n\n\n\n\n\nASD urged Australians to opt out of using passwords and replace them with multi-factor authentication, among a series of other measures , to keep their families' data safe.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\u201cWe are more like a medical item than a fashion piece,\u201d says Jochen Gutzy, Birkenstock chief communications officer. \u201cAs our chief executive says, \u2018we\u2019re like aspirin for the feet\u2019.\u201d Fashion is a relative newcomer to the Birkenstock business, with supermodel Heidi Klum launching their first official fashion collaboration in 2003. But the brand\u2019s medical history runs far deeper than Klum\u2019s noughties denim designs. Loading The footwear company\u2019s journey began in 1774, with German shoemaker Johann Birkenstock. It picks up pace in 1897 with great-grandson Konrad Birkenstock and his fixation on orthopaedic shoe lasts. That foot-health fixation remains, outlasting a series of Carls and Karls in the family, which gave up control of the business in 2012. It has even survived an IPO in 2023, when the company was valued at up to $US8.3 billion ($12.8 billion).\n\n\u201cWalking is like breathing and drinking water, and the footbeds are the ingredient that the human being needs for healthy living,\u201d Gutzy says. \u201cWe care about people\u2019s health and wellbeing. Now I think fashion is looking for the real thing because the consumers are better informed.\u201d Birkenstocks being assembled at the company\u2019s German factory in G\u00f6rlitz. While Gutzy is happy with growing sales to fashion consumers, the business is not chasing collaborations, having declined potentially lucrative partnerships with former Louis Vuitton creative director Marc Jacobs, streetwear giant Supreme and Guram Gvasalia\u2019s French fashion brand Vetements. A year after Louis Vuitton said yes to a partnership with Supreme in 2017, which was greeted with fanfare by Vogue and GQ, Birkenstock said no.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no benefit for us except prostitution because this is just prostitution,\u201d Reichert told The Cut. Marc Jacobs unofficially adapted Birkenstocks for the runway for his seminal grunge spring 1993 collection for Perry Ellis. More recently, when Jacobs approached Birkenstock with sketches for an official collaboration, it was time to raise the red flag, again, Gutzy says. \u201cWe said \u2018thank you, but no\u2019 because the ideas that he had in mind for the outsole... it might get some attention out there, but from an orthopedic standpoint, it\u2019s wrong, so let\u2019s not do it. \u201cWe feel comfortable with what we\u2019re doing. When I joined the company in 2012, we produced 12.3 million pairs. Now we are sitting [at] around 40 million. We plan on doubling that capacity in the coming years.\u201d At Birkenstock factories outside the picturesque German town of G\u00f6rlitz, automated machines are being introduced alongside the 1900 workers supervising the production of cork innersoles, the cutting of leather and precise placement of buckles.\n\nDuring a workshop, where I designed my own pair of sandals (sorry Supreme and Marc Jacobs) I learnt that it\u2019s pronounced Birken-sh-tock. Say the name correctly and no one will question your decision to wear sandals with socks. An off-duty Gigi Hadid in New York. Right: Birkenstock \u201cBoston Big Buckle\u201d clogs. Birkenstock manufactures 95 per cent of its shoes in Germany, and has a factory outpost in Portugal. Last month the company said it had bought a facility near Dresden to further increase its manufacturing capacity. Entrepreneur Margot Fraser distributed the shoes through Californian health food stores in the \u201960s, cementing their hippie reputation for crunchy granola feet. The US is still crucial to the brand\u2019s success. In Australia, Marcel Goerke pioneered an appetite for the footwear, challenging the supremacy of the thong as summer footwear in 1992, with a catalogue aimed at the local market. In 1993 Birkenstock opened its first store in Melbourne. Sydney had to wait until 2024.\n\nLoading \u201cMarcel was raised in a family that distributed Birkenstock shoes over the span of three generations and then moved to Australia,\u201d says Gutzy. \u201cAustralian consumers understand the product. It\u2019s one of the markets with the highest per capita usage of Birkenstock products worldwide.\u201d In the \u201990s Goerke noticed that Birkenstocks wore down more quickly in Australia than in Germany, and pushed a repairs program. Last year more than 5000 pairs were repaired in Australia. \u201cThey are designed to be repaired,\u201d Gutzy says. Having found their feet in the world of fashion, Birkenstock has one more obstacle to face.",

    "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s one born every minute\u201d is the ominous headline on Richard Z. Santos\u2019s article for Slate about the booming business of luxury writers\u2019 retreats. And yes, there is this vague suggestion throughout his piece that the people who sign up for these expensive adventures could be conning themselves.\n\nSpend a few thousand to get to Guatemala and enjoy a beach massage and a traditional Mayan shaman fire ceremony, Santos writes. Spend a week on the Queen Mary 2, or a Tuscan estate, or a French chateau. \u201cMaybe \u2013 if your jet lag and the wine from the night before have worn off \u2013 you can even sneak in a little writing time.\u201d\n\nThe ocean liner Queen Mary 2 is one of the options for a luxury writers\u2019 retreat. Credit: Cunard\n\nOn the internet, there are dozens of these tempting offers for writers or wannabe writers with deep pockets, all sounding like White Lotus without the horrible people. These are not venerable writers\u2019 retreats such as Yaddo in New York State, where applicants compete to get in. Anyone with the cash can go.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fantastic if someone was serving you delicious, healthy food, and there was a crackerjack writing coach on call if you have a question or get stuck?\u201d it says on the website of Jennifer Louden, who organises retreats in the US. \u201cAnd a glorious wise circle of women to giggle with.\u201d",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Harry Enfield, legendary British comedian, pioneering 1990s satirist, is sitting in a small, brightly lit London kitchen beside a sink. It\u2019s almost a surprise. Early communications from his people suggested Enfield would only be interviewed about his upcoming Australian tour, Harry Enfield: And No Chums, if he did it as one of his famous comedy characters. Cash-waving Cockney loudmouth Loadsamoney perhaps. Or maybe well-bred fool Tim Nice-But-Dim Esq, or cheesy radio DJ Dave \u201cNicey\u201d Nice (my vote). All part of the cavalcade of characters he played in BBC TV shows that made Enfield a household name in Britain from the 1980s onwards. But here is the real Enfield, hands clasped on top his head as he explains why there is a hammer an arm\u2019s reach away on the sink top. \u201cWell, one of my people is sitting here shaking his head and giggling,\u201d Enfield says of a confidant just beyond the laptop\u2019s screen. \u201cOne has to discipline one\u2019s people sometimes, right?\u201d In the 1990s, more than 10 million people tuned in to watch Enfield\u2019s sketch TV shows, from Harry Enfield\u2019s Television Programme to Harry Enfield & Chums and Harry & Paul, the latter adding his longtime collaborator Paul Whitehouse to the title. Harry Enfield as his character Kevin the Teenager. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo Enfield was already famous in late-1980s Britain for TV appearances as Greek kebab-shop owner character Stavros and Loadsamoney, the bravado-infused figure satirising prime minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s ideology and politics. When Enfield got his own show, a plethora of comedy guises and double acts was unleashed, ranging from clueless upper-class twit Tim Nice-But-Dim Esq, working-class caricatures Wayne and Waynetta Slob, witless young Conservative Tory Boy and cheesy radio DJs Smashie and Nicey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch was the fame of Enfield\u2019s recalcitrant adolescent character Kevin the Teenager, he and best friend Perry, played by actor, director and regular collaborator Kathy Burke, got their own feature film, Kevin & Perry Go Large, in 2000. The movie\u2019s promotional tour 25 years ago brought Enfield to Australia for the first time, although he barely saw the place. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve been there, and I just really sat in a hotel room for two days,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I went out at lunchtime, cuddled the Sydney Opera House and then ran back. That was all I did. It was nice to fondle it.\u201d Enfield\u2019s TV shows in the 1990s and 2000s were shown here, but he may be better known for The Windsors (2016-2023), a sitcom lampooning the British royal family in which Enfield played Prince Charles and then the King. His portrayal of the monarch \u2013 all furrowed brow, cuff-twiddling and starchy downturned mouth \u2013 was, he says, parody but not without empathy. That\u2019s been his approach with every character, no matter their stature. Enfield with frequent collaborator Paul Whitehouse as their characters The Old Gits. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo \u201cWhat Paul Whitehouse and Kathy Burke and I have always done is a lot of stuff that\u2019s full of truth,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Kevin the Teenager, everyone has teenagers, they know that kind of thing, but it\u2019s always nice, it\u2019s never nasty. It might be mischievous, but it\u2019s never malicious. And I think that\u2019s what people like really. Or most people.\u201d Enfield, who rarely gives interviews and eschews celebrity status, is segmenting Harry Enfield: And No Chums between character performance, talking about his career and answering questions from the audience. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m very old to be doing Kevin now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m 64. But I\u2019ll be talking about how he affects my life these days. There will be loads of characters in the show, but I\u2019ll also be talking about my life in comedy and how [comedy has] changed and also the people I\u2019ve done that I\u2019ve got into trouble for doing, maybe a little bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some characters from decades ago that he wouldn\u2019t do now. \u201cBecause things have changed a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are more wary. I\u2019m not really sure who invents the rules these days.\u201d He recalls working on satirical TV puppet show Spitting Image and voicing boxer Frank Bruno, a casting that wouldn\u2019t happen today. He\u2019s not certain Women, Know Your Limits!, his satire about misogyny \u2013 presented as a 1930s-style British public service announcement about the terrors of letting women think for themselves \u2013 would be allowed now either. TAKE 7: THE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO HARRY ENFIELD Worst habit? Some might say I\u2019m big-headed. Greatest fear? Losing my staggeringly good looks. The line that stayed with you? How Peter Cook described me: \u201cLauded by his equals, feared by his rivals and loathed by all and sundry.\u201d Biggest regret? I wish I had drowned my sisters. I have had to share my mummy\u2019s affections with them. Favourite book? I haven\u2019t written one about myself yet. But when I do, it\u2019ll be that. The artwork/song you wish was yours? Release The Bats by Nick Cave\u2019s Birthday Party. If you could time travel, where would you choose to go? I would travel forward 200 years. By then there will be a vast statue of me in every world metropolis. \u201cThere\u2019d probably be a lot of people saying you\u2019re perpetuating stereotypes,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is rubbish, obviously, but that\u2019s just an example. In fact, a few years ago, I went on this yoga week and there was this German woman who was very sweet but kept on frowning at me. \u201cI thought, oh, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done. And then one day, she came up and said, \u2018I\u2019ve realised who you are. You\u2019re Women, Know Your Limits!\u2019 She was a professor in gender studies, and she said every year, the first thing she shows her new students is that sketch, and then they start from there. That was lovely, you know? Pretty much everything I do is that kind of thing.\u201d Enfield\u2019s era of TV crammed with sketch comedy shows is over. Drama wins over comedy, he says, in terms of funding. He\u2019s pleased to see David Mitchell and Robert Webb have a new TV sketch show, Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping, but equally cheered by the diversity and number of people making new comedy online. \u201cThere are more people frightened of more things nowadays and more people frightened of offending anyone,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, people who want to be offended are always going to be offended. As I say, my thing is mischief, not malice. Some people will find that offensive because they\u2019ve got a fixed view of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and they don\u2019t really have a sense of humour about things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnfield is a big fan of Australian comedian Sam Campbell and British poet, comedian and actor Tim Key, and is regularly taken to see new comedians by his adult children. He and Whitehouse get together as much as possible. \u201cHe\u2019s the loveliest man,\u201d Enfield says. \u201cI once upset Richard Curtis. He said to me, \u2018I\u2019m still trying to get over when you said I\u2019m the second-nicest man in the world after Paul Whitehouse.\u2019\u201d What does he think of fans from the other side of the globe, in a place he visited once 25 years, wanting to see his show? Enfield may be part of a steady groundswell of tours by comics of his generation \u2013 Ben Elton, Tony Robinson, Alan Davies, Eddie Izzard, Bill Bailey to name a few \u2013 but their TV and live shows are perhaps better known here. Loading \u201cDo you mean I\u2019m culty?\u201d Enfield says, leaning forward with a quizzical smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never been culty over here, I\u2019ve just been on the telly. So, I like being a cult. That\u2019s good.\u201d He is greatly looking forward to being in Australia again, although his friend Elton, a longtime Australian resident, will be away. \u201cI\u2019m coming to talk to everyone about everything,\u201d he says. \u201cIncluding meeting Camilla in real life.\u201d What was that like? \u201cIt was cool,\u201d Enfield says. \u201cShe was very nice. I sat next her in church, and we had a little chat. I didn\u2019t tell her some of the nastier things \u2026 not nasty, but some of the silly and naughty things that we\u2019ve done [about her].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",
