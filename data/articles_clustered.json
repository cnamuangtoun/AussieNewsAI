    "text": "The homicide trial of late global football star Diego Maradona's medical team for alleged malpractice has been declared a mistrial by an Argentine court.\n\nThe decision on Thursday follows the removal of one of the three judges overseeing the case by an Argentine court.\n\nOne of the trial's defendants had requested the disqualification of Judge Julieta Makintach due to a possible lack of impartiality and for allegedly authorising the filming of a documentary during court hearings.\n\nDiego Maradona captained Argentina to World Cup victory in 1986. (Getty)\n\nMakintach accepted the court's disqualification but defended her conduct.\n\n\"My impartiality is not at stake. There is no suspicion of a lack of neutrality because there is nothing that could imply that,\" Makintach said on Tuesday prior to being removed.\n\nThe ousted judge is accused of authorising a camera crew to film the hearings, which breached judicial rules. Makintach claims she only gave an interview and has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nA fresh trial will be held with a new panel of judges. But it remains unclear when the new trial will begin.\n\n\"The new court will discuss the admissibility of the evidence, and a debate hearing will be set, where each party will have to redraw the accusation line, the defence lines and, from there, start these debates again,\" Cosme Iribarren, one of the prosecutors, said after the court's decision.\n\nREAD MORE: Israel authorises new settlements most countries view as illegal\n\nArgentine Judge Julieta Makintach is accused of authorising a camera crew to film the hearings during the trial. (AP Photo/Gustavo Garello) (AP)\n\nFernando Burlando, one of the lawyers representing Maradona's daughters, hopes the new trial could end with a quicker sentencing.\n\n\"Given the great knowledge that all parties have of the case, we can do it in an express manner and we could have the trial for the death of Diego Armando Maradona, perhaps with a sentence before the end of the year,\" Burlando said outside the court in Buenos Aires.\n\n\"The only thing we want is for the process to move forward,\" Dalma Maradona, the soccer star's daughter, said.\n\nMaradona, world-famous for scoring the goal that won Argentina the 1986 World Cup, died at the age of 60 due to heart failure in November 2020, days after undergoing surgery for a subdural hematoma.\n\nThe spotlight is on neurosurgeon Leonardo Luque, Maradona's personal physician for the last four years of his life. (AP PHOTO/NATACHA PISARENKO)\n\nArgentine prosecutors have accused eight medical staff of \"simple homicide\" in the footballer's death.\n\nThe prosecutors in the case seek to prove that there was malpractice during his home hospitalisation and that the medical team responsible for his care acted recklessly and negligently.\n\nThe trial for seven of the eight defendants began in March, with the eighth due to be tried by jury after the initial proceedings finish. The charges carry a possible sentence of eight to 25 years in prison.",

    "text": "President Donald Trump has audaciously claimed virtually unlimited power to bypass Congress and impose sweeping taxes on foreign products.\n\nNow a federal court has thrown a roadblock in his path.\n\nA three-judge panel of the US Court of International Trade ruled Wednesday that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and plaster taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 on imports from almost every country in the world.\n\nThe ruling was a big setback for Trump, whose erratic trade policies have rocked financial markets, paralysed businesses with uncertainty and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.\n\nA federal appeals court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump to continue collecting tariffs under an emergency powers law for now. (AP)\n\nBut Trump's trade wars are far from over. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Thursday allowed the president to temporarily continue collecting the tariffs under the emergency powers law while he appeals the trade court's decision.\n\nJeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the nonprofit Liberty Justice Centre who represented the five small businesses that sued, called the appeals court order a mere \"procedural step''. He expressed confidence that courts would block the tariffs, which represent \"a direct threat'' to his clients' livelihoods.\n\nThe administration has other ways to pursue the president's goal of using tariffs to lure factories back to America, raise money for the US Treasury and pressure other countries into bending to his will.\n\nFinancial markets, which would welcome an end to Trump's tariffs, had a muted response to the news Thursday; stocks rose modestly.\n\n\"Investors are not getting too carried away, presumably in the expectation that the White House will find a workaround that allows them to continue to pursue their trade agenda,'' said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at the financial services firm Ebury.\n\nTrump's IEEPA tariffs are being challenged in at least seven lawsuits. In the ruling Wednesday, the trade court combined two of the cases \u2014 one brought by five small businesses and another by 12 US states.\n\nThe US Court of International Trade has jurisdiction over civil cases involving trade. The legal challenge to Trump's tariff is widely expected to end up at the US Supreme Court.\n\nWhich tariffs did the court block?\n\nThe court's decision blocks the tariffs Trump slapped last month on almost all US trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.\n\nTrump on April 2 \u2014 Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50 per cent on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10 per cent baseline tariffs on almost everybody else. He later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the United States \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. But he kept the baseline tariffs in place.\n\nClaiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, he justified the taxes under IEEPA by declaring the United States' longstanding trade deficits \"a national emergency.\"\n\n\"The reason that he chose IEEPA was he thought he could do this unilaterally without much oversight by Congress,\" Schwab said.\n\nIn February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the US border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.\n\nThe US Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But politicians have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Trump has made the most of it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during the 157th National Memorial Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery, Monday, May 26, 2025, in Arlington, Va. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) (AP)\n\nWhy did the court rule against the president?\n\nThe administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the US dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.\n\nThe court rejected the administration's argument this time, deciding that Trump's sweeping tariffs exceeded his authority to regulate imports under IEEPA. It also said the tariffs did nothing to deal with problems they were supposed to address. In their case, the states noted that America's trade deficits hardly amount to a sudden emergency. The United States has racked them up for 49 straight years in good times and bad.\n\nAnother federal judge also blocked Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose tariffs on Thursday. The ruling from US District Judge Rudolph Contreras came in a lawsuit from two Illinois-based educational toy companies. The ruling only blocks the collection of tariffs from the companies that sued, and was handed down the day after the trade court's broader finding.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Driver charged over Liverpool football parade tragedy\n\nSo where does this leave Trump's trade agenda?\n\nWendy Cutler, a former US trade official who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, says Wednesday's decision \"throws the president's trade policy into turmoil.\"\n\nOther countries may be reluctant to make concessions during Trump's 90-day pause if there's a chance the courts will uphold the decision striking down the IEEPA tariffs. \"Can those negotiations move forward?'' said Antonio Rivera, a partner at ArentFox Schiff and a former Customs and Border Protection attorney.\n\nLikewise, companies will have to reassess the way they run their supply chains, perhaps speeding up shipments to the United States to offset the risk that the tariffs will be reinstated on appeal.\n\nStill, the ruling leaves in place other Trump tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminium and autos. Those levies were invoked under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot simply be imposed at the president's own discretion.\n\nTrump still has the authority to raise those Section 232 tariffs. He can also pursue new ones. The Commerce Department, for instance, last month launched a Section 232 investigation into the national security implications of pharmaceutical imports.\n\nThe court also left in place tariffs Trump imposed on China in his first term\u2014 and President Joe Biden kept \u2014 in a dispute over Beijing's use of hard-nose tactics to give Chinese companies an edge in advanced technology. The US alleged that China unfairly subsidised its own firms, forced companies from the US and other foreign countries to hand over trade secrets and even engaged in cybertheft. Trump has leeway to expand those tariffs if he wants to put more pressure on China.\n\nThe trade court also noted Wednesday that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15 per cent and to just 150 days on countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.\n\nWhat is the likely the economic and financial fallout from the decision?\n\nWhen the IEEPA tariffs were in place, America's average tariff rate was 15 per cent, the highest in decades and up from 2.5 per cent before Trump's tariff onslaught began this year. Without them, the US tariff rate is still a hefty 6.5 per cent, according to economists Stephen Brown and Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics.\n\nThey say the US economy would grow faster in the second half of 2025 \u2014 at a 2 per cent annual rate, up from the 1.5 per cent they'd been forecasting \u2014 without the weight of the IEEPA tariffs. Prices also wouldn't rise as fast.\n\nImporters may get relief. Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday, lawyer Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote that if the trade court's decision \"is upheld, importers should eventually be able to get a refund of (IEEPA) tariffs paid to date. But the government will probably seek to avoid paying refunds until appeals are exhausted.\u2033",

    "text": "A paraglider has shared his extraordinary story of survival after being unexpectedly lifted into the upper atmosphere during a flight, reaching an altitude of 8,598 metres without oxygen, and narrowly escaping death.\n\nPeng Yujiang, 55, was conducting a routine equipment test on Saturday at a training site about 3,000m above sea level in north-west China's Gansu Province, when he was lifted in an unexpected updraft over the Qilian Mountains.\n\n\"I had just bought a second-hand paragliding harness and wanted to test it. So I was conducting ground parachute shaking. After a while, the wind suddenly picked up and lifted me into the air. I tried to land as soon as possible, but I failed,\" Mr Peng told China Media Group.\n\nWhat started as a calm session quickly turned dangerous when a sudden surge of wind pulled him into rapidly forming cumulonimbus clouds.\n\nDespite trying to descend, he became trapped in the cloud system.\n\n\"I found myself surrounded by cumulonimbus clouds and trapped inside,\" he said.\n\n\"It was terrifying \u2014 everything around me was white. Without the compass, I wouldn't have known which direction I was heading.\n\n\"I thought I was flying straight, but in reality, I was spinning. Eventually, I managed to fly out toward the north-east.\"\n\nPeng Yujiang said he became completely disorientated in the incident. (Reuters/CCTV)\n\nExperts said Mr Peng encountered a rare and dangerous phenomenon known as \"cloud suck\", a condition in which strong convective updrafts carry paragliders to extreme altitudes.\n\nInside such clouds, experts explained that temperatures can plummet to -40 degrees Celsius and oxygen levels are severely low.\n\nWithout an oxygen mask and with his face exposed, Mr Peng endured freezing conditions as ice crystals formed on his face, body and equipment.\n\nHis gloves were not fully zipped, leaving his hands numb and nearly frozen. Still, he managed to control his paraglider using his compass and radio communication with teammates.\n\n\"As soon as I came out of the clouds, I was very excited because I had survived. The scariest moment was when I tried to pull out of the spiral and failed and when the canopy nosedived. It's still frightening to think about. I'm not sure about the future, but for now I definitely won't fly for a while,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities have issued Peng Yujiang with a temporary flying ban following the ordeal. (Reuters/CCTV)\n\nLooking back at his flight data, he was shocked to learn he had reached 8,598 meters \u2014 far higher than he had realised mid-air. He suspects he may have briefly lost consciousness during descent.\n\nHis experience echoes that of German paraglider Ewa Wisnierska, who survived -40C temperatures after being sucked into a storm system in northern NSW in 2007.\n\nShe reached an altitude higher than Mount Everest.\n\nMs Wisnierska said blacking out saved her life because it \"slowed down all her functions\".\n\nShe had been training for the upcoming Paragliding World Championships at the time.\n\nMr Peng meanwhile has been paragliding for four and a half years and holds a B-level licence \u2014 China's second tier in a five-level system, requiring at least 20 days of flight experience and a minimum of 40 individual flights.\n\nThe Gansu provincial aeronautical sports association issued a report on Wednesday, local time, saying that ground parachute shaking does not require prior approval and that Mr Peng's experience was entirely an unforeseen accident.\n\nHowever, Mr Peng was still handed a six-month flight suspension, as the flight site and airspace had not been approved in advance.\n\nReuters/ABC",

Her conduct caused harm to both the plaintiffs and the defence,\" Judge Maximiliano Savarino said in declaring the mistrial. \"The only person responsible is the recused judge.\n\n\"This is an unpleasant decision.\"\n\nAt the courthouse, two of the soccer star's daughters, Gianinna and Dalma Maradona, began to weep.\n\nThe decision threw into doubt the timeline of the trial, which was initially expected to last until July.\n\nThursday's ruling said a higher court would select the three new judges by lottery \"within a reasonable period of time\".\n\nWhat the trial is examining\n\nThe case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care for the soccer star in weeks leading up to his sudden death on November 25, 2020.\n\nMaradona homicide trial in limbo as judge steps down Photo shows Fans of Argentine soccer legend Diego Armando Maradona hold a banner that reads ''Justice for God'' The future of the trial is now in doubt as one of the three presiding judges has stepped down from the case amid accusations of ethical breaches.\n\nMaradona died at age 60 from cardiac arrest while recovering from surgery for a blood clot on the brain at a rented home outside Buenos Aires.\n\nAlthough the case largely hinges on medical technicalities, the bi-weekly testimonies have also become tabloid fodder \u2014 like much in Maradona's life, which included long spates of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nExperts have taken the stand to allege that Maradona agonised for 12 hours before his death while his sisters and daughters have tearfully accused his medics of leaving him alone in squalor when he should have been hospitalised.\n\nThe defendants, who deny all accusations, were charged with culpable homicide, a crime similar to involuntary manslaughter in that it implies the accused were aware of the risk caused by their reckless conduct and ignored it.\n\nThey include Leopoldo Luque, Maradona's primary physician at the time of his death, as well as his psychologist, psychiatrist, medical coordinator and nurses.\n\nThe crime carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The defendants say Maradona was a difficult patient who did not allow himself to be treated.\n\nMaradona, who famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup, is regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time.\n\nHis rags-to-riches story resonated with his fellow Argentines and he is widely revered as a national hero.\n\nAP",

    "text": "Alex de Minaur has joined the chorus of tennis voices calling for the crowded men's tennis schedule to be shortened, warning that players are in danger of having their careers ended early with physical and mental burnout.\n\nHis lament came on the day when he cited his own mental fatigue during his surprise exit at Roland Garros to Alexander Bublik on Thursday, and while his Australian colleague Adam Walton was having to battle with a shoulder injury in his loss to Andrey Rublev.\n\nDe Minaur then chose the moment to launch a wider broadside about the state of the men's ATP tour program, echoing the complaints kicked off by fellow Australian Jordan Thompson earlier in the week.\n\n\"No-one's got a solution,\" said de Minaur, admitting the tour grind was affecting him after his 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 loss.\n\n\"But the solution is simple: you shorten the schedule, right?\n\n\"What's not normal is that for the last three, four years I've had two days off after the Davis Cup and I've gone straight into pre-season, straight into the new season again.\n\n\"Once you start, you don't finish until November 24. So it's never-ending. The way it's structured \u2026 I had to deal with that. I'm still dealing with that right now.\n\n\"The solution is you shorten, because what's going to happen is players' careers are going to get shorter and shorter because they're just going to burn out mentally. There's just too much tennis.\"\n\nThompson, who has been battling on all season with three injuries he believes have only been exacerbated by the ceaseless tour grind, had earlier described the ATP schedule as \"shit\" and \"just a joke\".\n\nTwo-time French Open finalist Casper Ruud also picked up the theme after his own injury-hampered defeat to Nuno Borges on Wednesday as he likened the ATP's ranking system to a \"rat race\" with players feeling compelled to compete in the men's tour's mandatory events even if they are carrying injuries.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"You feel you're obligated to play with certain rules that the ATP have set up with the mandatory events,\" he said.\n\n\"You feel like you lose a lot if you don't show up and play \u2026 the punishments are quite hard, in terms of everyone else will play, gain points, and you won't.\n\n\"If you don't play a mandatory event, they cut 25 per cent of your year-end bonus.\n\n\"You're forcing players to show up injured or sick, or whatever, when that's not what I think is very fair.\"\n\nBrisbane's Walton admitted after his straight-sets defeat that he was still battling on with an arm injury \"that's not great\".\n\n\"The season's pretty relentless. I don't have the luxury, like some of the top players, in being able to play less. I guess if you're good enough, you don't have to play as much to collect points, right?\" the world No.91 said.\n\n\"So in order for me to collect all the points, I've got to play a lot. I don't have a solution, but yes, it is very taxing on the body.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to. A newsletter delivered each Saturday.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "When Oprah Winfrey first read the Alice Walker novel The Colour Purple, she became obsessed with it.\n\nSpeaking to Larry King on his talk show in 2009, she explained how she was cast in the 1985 Steven Spielberg film.\n\nListen to the podcast Photo shows Future Tense tile. Future Tense explores new ideas and new technologies.\n\n\"I ate, slept, thought all the time about The Colour Purple \u2026 when I moved to Chicago, I got a call asking me to audition [for the] movie, I had never gotten a call like that in my life from anybody,\" she says.\n\nDespite that stroke of luck, Winfrey was convinced she hadn't got the role.\n\n\"I'm singing, praying and crying, and a woman comes out to me and says there is a phone call for me \u2026 It was [director] Steven Spielberg saying he wanted to see me in his office in California tomorrow.\"\n\nOprah was offered her dream role playing Sofia in the film, which went on to be a box-office hit.\n\n\" What I learned from that was that I had drawn The Colour Purple into my life \u2026 and it changed the way I thought about my life forever. \"\n\nWhat is manifestation?\n\nWinfrey's interview on Larry King was about the self-help book she endorsed, The Secret, which had exploded in popularity at the time.\n\nWritten by Australian author Rhonda Byrne, the book claimed to help readers harness the laws of attraction \u2014 essentially the belief that thought alone could help you get what you want.\n\nOprah Winfrey is a big supporter of manifestation and believes it's what led to her being cast in the hit film The Colour Purple. (Reuters: Mike Segar)\n\nIt's been nearly 20 years since the book was published, and the practice of manifestation and positive thinking continues to gain popularity across cultures.\n\nIt can involve methods like being clear and intentional about your goals and practising rituals to help bring those goals into reality.\n\nThe rituals are varied, but can include journalling, vocalising mantras, practising positive self-talk and creating vision boards.\n\nManifesting is also big business with self-help professionals, like Mel Robbins and Gabrielle Bernstein, releasing countless books, podcasts and international speaking tours on how to do it.\n\nIn a 2022 podcast episode about manifestation, Robbins claims the form of manifesting she promotes is \"backed by neuroscience\" and isn't just wishful thinking.\n\nLife coach Mel Robbins backs the practice of manifesting, but doesn't believe it's simply wishful thinking. (Getty: Scott Eisen / Stringer)\n\n\"It is a tool that you are going to use precisely, intentionally, systematically with purpose, because you use manifesting to rewire your mind \u2026 to help you do the work to achieve your dreams.\"\n\nThere's no denying that manifestation is popular, and the way that individuals use it in their own lives can be varied.\n\nBut is there a dark side to the practice?\n\nThe downsides to relying on positive thinking\n\nWinfrey's public endorsement of The Secret on her widely watched show helped boost the book's popularity, but it was not without criticism.\n\nFor example, when Kim Tinkham appeared on the show in 2007, she told Winfrey she was so moved by The Secret that she was going to forego cancer treatment, against her doctor's advice.\n\nWinfrey tried to talk her out of this, clarifying that she didn't think this was the message to take away from the book.\n\nTinkham died in 2010.\n\nWhen discussing the book on King's show, Winfrey wanted to clarify her endorsement of The Secret, saying that the mistake it made was that it \"tried to let that be the answer to all questions.\" She added: \"The law of attraction is just one law, there are many laws working in the world\".\n\nLaura D'Olimpio is an associate professor from the University of Birmingham and says she believes manifestation stops many people from learning.\n\n\"I see manifesting as a form of wishful thinking and therefore, in my mind, it's an intellectual vice, because it's a way of thinking that interrupts our attainment of knowledge,\" she tells ABC Radio National's Future Tense.\n\nD'Olimpio claims that manifesting promotes self-centredness \u2014 and self-blame if it doesn't work.\n\n\"The thing that strikes me about manifesting is that it really narrows down just on 'what I want',\" she says.\n\nThis approach worries her.\n\n\" [Manifesting] downplays the role of other features in making something come true or not, which can include chance, luck, circumstance and the efforts of others. \"\n\nManifesting, like many self-help concepts, comes with rituals.\n\nOne is the 369 manifestation method, which went viral on social media in 2021, and includes the act of writing down what you want to manifest three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon and nine times at night.\n\nD'Olimpio says rituals like the 369 method promote obsessive and compulsive thinking.\n\n\"It seems to really encourage that obsessive ritual of trying to make this belief come into reality through the power of thought,\" she says.\n\nAlong with Winfrey, celebrities including Ariana Grande, and Dua Lipa, have credited manifestation as one of the reasons for their success.\n\nDr Laura D\u2019Olimpio says the popularity of manifesting is concerning. (Supplied: University of Birmingham: Dr Laura D\u2019Olimpio)\n\nFor example, when Lipa headlined Glastonbury last year, she told the crowd, \"I've written this moment down and wished for it and dreamt it and worked so hard\".\n\nWhile it's a romanticised way to frame your dreams coming true, D'Olimpio has concerns that manifestation is a \"closed theory\", meaning that if it doesn't work, we won't know about it.\n\n\"[Those that practise are] pointing to the outcome that they want to say, 'See, I'm right in manifesting'. But that's a form of confirmation bias,\" she says.\n\n\"When it doesn't come about, they often say, 'Oh, well, it wasn't in my higher good or my best interest' \u2026 So you can't falsify it, which means that they're not deterred by instances where it doesn't come true.\"\n\nRealistic optimism\n\nPeople turn to manifestation for a variety of reasons, and many do so in the hope that they can maintain a positive mindset and attract good things.\n\nShould we hold onto hope? Photo shows An older woman with a scarf on her head cries. Hope may seem useless in desperate times, but it can be redefined to help people move through difficulty.\n\nAnd in recent years, it can feel like remaining optimistic is increasingly hard to achieve.\n\nPeople are grappling with the impacts of climate change, an increase in natural disasters and global conflicts, most notably Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nHumans need optimism to move forward, but there can be confusion about what that means, says author Sumit Paul-Choudhury.\n\n\"Being positive about the future doesn't necessarily mean that you have to think that everything is fine and will turn out to be fine,\" he says.\n\n\" I think a useful form of optimism doesn't deny that there are problems. \"\n\nWhile thinking optimistically can be a segue into engaging with self-help materials that promote manifesting, Paul-Choudhury says people should aim for dispositional optimism instead.\n\n\"It is this general approach to life in which you think that there are solutions to your problems and that there are always opportunities ahead,\" he says.\n\nStream your favourite shows on the free ABC listen app Photo shows Image of Dr Karl on a pink background and Listen app logo Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks \u2026 and you don't need to be a scientist to find it!\n\n\"You're generally always believing that there are ways forward that seem to be associated with better outcomes.\"\n\nPaul-Choudhury says those who aim for this type of optimism and mindset are more likely to live happier lives.\n\n\"People who rank reasonably strongly with that kind of optimism seem to live for longer.\"\n\nWhile D'Olimpio acknowledges there are valid concerns about manifestation, she doesn't want it to be viewed as criticism of optimism.\n\nShe says there is an important role for optimism in our society, and that \"manifesting distorts that positive thinking into thinking that thought alone can create reality\".\n\n\"I'm hoping that with education and other ways of opening up people's thinking, they can see that [manifesting] is a distorted version of positive thinking and very self-focused rather than community-based.\"",

So really it comes as no surprise that, within minutes of three American judges blocking his tariffs from taking effect this week, he hit back with an appeal and questioned their authority.\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring that the Court of International Trade took a stand. The judges stopped short of passing judgment on the effectiveness or wisdom of tariffs, but ruled the president couldn\u2019t just use emergency powers in an (apparent) bid to protect the US economy. That power, it reminded Trump, actually rests with the Congress. The situation remains fluid, though; overnight a federal appeals court agreed to temporarily preserve the tariffs while the appeal is urgently held.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is used to getting his own way. Credit: Bloomberg\n\nNonetheless it\u2019s probably a bit awkward for Trump, given his No.1 rival \u2013 Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2013 won\u2019t have the same constraints on his power. Whether Xi pushes forward with tariffs on the US is unclear (he also has a lot to lose from imposing tariffs) but he may want to seize the opportunity to rub the mud in Trump\u2019s face at a time when the US president can\u2019t fight back.\n\nBut whether or not the court\u2019s finding withstands the appeal, Trump has (and will continue to) hurt businesses and customers worldwide \u2013 including here in Australia.

Metres away, the kettle and microwave on the front verandah is the closest they can get to a kitchen for now.\n\nWhen the swollen Manning River finally receded last week, Bennett and her partner, Mario Agius, returned from the refuge of their neighbour\u2019s home on higher ground to find every inch of floor covered in a thick, brown sludge swept in from the waterway, which reached a record height days earlier.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a mud-free house,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cI appreciate the small things in life now.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still some seeping through the floors and gaps in her Croki home, but the shovelling and hosing down is done, and she\u2019s in good spirits.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, most of the mud had been cleared from Michelle Bennett\u2019s house.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nIn the madness of cleaning up, she\u2019s lost her last hair tie and been left with an unruly mop for days.\n\nBennett is collecting donated clothes from Cundletown\u2019s community centre, just across the river from Taree, when the Herald speaks with her; without power or a working washing machine, she\u2019s been wearing the same clothes for days.\n\nLike Bennett and Agius, many in Croki, a village a few kilometres along the Manning north from Taree, were left without insurance after flooding in 2021 upped premiums by more than $30,000 per year.\n\nThe devastation has taken its toll, though. When the Manning River started swelling, it was exciting seeing how high the waterway would rise, Bennett says. Then came the adrenaline rush of preparing for the flood to hit. That, too, was quickly replaced with the reality of the destruction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get there, we\u2019ve still got a roof over our heads,\u201d Bennett says.\n\nWithout insurance, it will be a long, costly road back to normality for Bennett and Agius, who will be left thousands of dollars out of pocket to make their home \u201cflood friendly\u201d for the next time the Manning breaks its banks.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cIt\u2019s just Mother Nature doing her thing at the moment.\u201d\n\nBennett and Agius know the risks of staying put on the banks of the Manning after two major floods in the past four years, but haven\u2019t once considered leaving their home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what our community does to pitch together to help,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cDifferent people in the community have been doing all different sorts of things. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nDozens of bags of Bennett and Agius\u2019 muddied clothes and bed linen have been picked up by neighbours and volunteers to be washed since the roads cleared.\n\nSoon, though, a volunteer at the community centre is on the hunt for a pack among the piles of gifted goods.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one, and I lost it the other night,\u201d Bennett laughs.\n\nUglow was one of only a few of Croki\u2019s few dozen residents whose homes weren\u2019t inundated when the Manning rose. Some had just finished renovating their homes after the 2021 flood battered the village; almost all lost their cars in both floods. This time around, the water stopped two millimetres short of flowing into the Uglows\u2019 home.\n\nThe main driver for moving, Uglow says, is the unaffordable insurance costs that leave locals vulnerable to losing everything each time the village floods.\n\nKile Nicholas checks on Phil Lorking, 80, in the isolated village of Croki last week. Credit: Kate Geraghty\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t do it again,\u201d Uglow says from beside a bonfire locals have gathered around nightly to keep morale high since the water receded.\n\nToby Uglow, who has lived with his wife, Rachel, in Croki since 2006, says while his home was spared any damage in this flood, some of the village\u2019s less fortunate long-term residents have decided to move on.\n\nTheir neighbours, though, are less optimistic and grappling with the decision to stay or go.\n\nThe lessons learnt there in the past three years could go a long way to better preparing the Mid North Coast, and towns like Taree, for the next natural disaster, says Elizabeth Mossop, the head of Living Lab Northern Rivers.\n\nMeanwhile just over four hours up the highway from Taree, Lismore has been on its own slow and winding road to recovery since the historic 2022 floods that left much of the town underwater and destroyed homes and businesses.\n\nWaters have mostly receded but damage to roads and bridges still prevents access to some parts, with resupply operations continuing.\n\nAbout 3500 people remain isolated in six communities across the mid-north coast and Hunter regions, while about 700 homes and 400 other buildings have been deemed uninhabitable. More than 6000 insurance claims have been filed, about a quarter of them coming from the MidCoast council area. The floods have also claimed five lives.\n\n\u201cThe face of the village is going to change a fair bit after this one,\u201d Uglow says. \u201cIt is very sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are all going to be dealing with versions of the same problem, and if they can find a way to really work together, to share resources and expertise, that lays the foundation,\u201d Mossop says.\n\n\u201cThey are all going to have to make plans for recovery.\u201d\n\nMossop leads the collaboration between the University of Technology Sydney, Southern Cross University and the NSW Reconstruction Authority which is focused on designing a sustainable future for Lismore. It has offered to carry out a similar initiative on the Mid North Coast.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of if another large-scale flood hits the region, but when, Mossop says.\n\n\u201cWhat you hope, is that we can just translate those things very directly so that people are not trying to reinvent the wheel,\u201d Mossop says.\n\nFirst, though, the region will need to focus on its recovery.\n\nSecuring housing for those who were displaced or lost their homes in the floods, and getting businesses back-up and running is at the top of the list to achieve that, Mossop says.\n\n\u201cObviously, the priority has to be focused on helping to make people whole again,\u201d Mossop says.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think about the future while you\u2019re dealing with the disaster, but when we get to the situation where people are starting to think about how to go forward, that kind of planning has to take place with building in an understanding of what it is going to take to make these places more resilient into the future.\u201d\n\nBut, Mossop says, that planning doesn\u2019t just need to take place on the Mid North Coast.\n\n\u201cThere are very few places anywhere in Australia that have thought seriously about the kind of adaptation work to minimise the impacts of flooding,\u201d Mossop says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve thought about it, historically, in a kind of 20th century way of \u2018How can we defeat the floodwaters, how can we keep the floodwaters out of here?\u2019 And we\u2019re now dealing with a scale of events where that\u2019s not possible.\n\n\u201cWe have to think about it in this different way ... what can we do if the floodwaters are coming? What can we do to minimise the damage that they cause, to minimise threats to safety, and to minimise the period of disruption that is caused by these floods.\u201d\n\nLoading\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just floods, the regions\u2019 resilience against other disasters, including bushfires needs to be improved.\n\nWhat that looks like going forward is not yet clear.\n\nIn Lismore, a $900 million buyback scheme, under which homes in the city\u2019s most flood-prone areas have been bought by the NSW government, was introduced to move properties and people out of harm\u2019s way. No such scheme has been locked in for the Mid North Coast, but it is one of many options on the table.\n\nPlan and adapt\n\nMal Lanyon, chief executive of the NSW Reconstruction Authority, says authorities are working through disaster adaptation planning to understand the risks associated with each region, and what kind of mitigation can be put in place, so residents can live safely in communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about recovery, it\u2019s about trying to prevent the impacts of disasters before they happen, knowing that obviously we can\u2019t stop disasters in the types of rainfall that we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of weeks,\u201d Lanyon says.\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to say whether Taree and the Mid North Coast\u2019s recovery could be modelled on Lismore and the Northern Rivers, Lanyon says there have been significant lessons from the past few years, including how quickly clean-up started.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made significant strides,\u201d Lanyon says. \u201cWe had a plan in long before any of the water started to recede.\u201d\n\nBut, for all the lessons that were learnt from previous floods, there are many that weren\u2019t.\n\nSome locals in and around Taree say they were left in the dark about the scale of the disaster flowing down the Manning until it was too late, warned that the flooding would reach only minor to moderate levels. Instead, the river reached its highest levels since 1929.\n\nDuring some of the heaviest rainfall that hit Taree, three flood gauges immediately upstream from Taree were unavailable. If not for their own research and diligence after similar issues during the 2021 floods, Toby Uglow says, Croki residents would have been caught off guard by the record flooding.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says the gauges, which provide the weather bureau with real-time data on river levels, were unavailable at various times during the flooding due to a Telstra outage, but that its weather forecasts and warnings service is \u201cresilient and not dependent on any one piece of equipment\u201d.\n\n\u201cForecasts and warnings for all regions are based on a combination of many different observing systems including satellites, automatic weather stations, radars, rain gauges and hydrological monitoring stations. The composite nature of these systems allows specialist staff to monitor approaching weather and issue forecasts and warnings,\u201d the weather bureau said in a statement, adding that flood warnings for the Manning, Myall, Paterson, Williams and Hunter rivers had been in place for several days before the gauges were affected.\n\nPaul and Liz Brennan, who were helicoptered to safety from their flooded Oxley Island home across the river from Taree, say they only became aware of the severity of the flooding when it was too late to evacuate.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be another one of these examples where we were unable to provide people with effective advice about what was going to happen,\u201d Mossop says.\n\nRescued: Oaxley Island residents Liz Brennan, her husband Paul Brennan (second from right) and a neighbour (right). Credit: Kate Geraghty\n\nThe complete scale of the damage in these floods is not yet clear, but the impact is being tallied as the water recedes; across the Mid North Coast, water inundated more than 1100 homes, more than 15,000 cubic metres of flood debris has been cleared, and more than 1200 cattle carcasses, a number expected to increase, have been retrieved.\n\nOutside the major centres across both the Mid North Coast and Hunter regions, farmers have been hit as hard as anyone.\n\nIn Hinton, near Maitland in the Hunter, the Wilson family threw thousands of dollars of milk away when road closures that isolated the tiny town stopped trucks from reaching the farm.\n\nWith 200 of the farm\u2019s 250 acres underwater, the Wilsons lost all of their grazing paddocks they rely on to feed their 180-odd cattle. Until at least September they will have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on buying hay while they wait for the paddocks to dry and become workable again.\n\n\u201cThe farmers put so much into their land and care for their animals \u2026 there is a mental health component right through these sorts of incidents and impacts on those directly affected,\u201d Lanyon says.\n\nIt\u2019s farmers like the Wilsons who will be struggling to get up and keep going again, Lanyon says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got little doubt that some people, particularly primary producers who have been through this a number of times, are feeling despair,\u201d he says.\n\nLocals start the clean-up on Manning Street in Taree. Credit: Kate Geraghty\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re people that love their animals, they love working the land, and yet they\u2019ve found over the past few years, that they\u2019ve had repeated disasters, which has not only impacted on their income, but certainly on their lifestyle and on their animals.\u201d\n\nWhatever the way forward, planning for the next disaster needs to start now, MidCoast Mayor Claire Pontin says.\n\n\u201cWe are needing to have a discussion about where to from here,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is not a clear path.\u201d\n\nPontin is keen to start immediate talks with state and federal governments about what mitigation work can be done to help protect the Mid North Coast.\n\n\u201cIt is something that we need to start doing on behalf of the community,\u201d Pontin says.\n\n\u201cSome of our people now have just been flooded so many times they\u2019re tearing their hair out, and they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nLoading\n\nBut, through all the destruction, and despite the long road ahead, Pontin is hopeful the community will recover as it has done before.\n\n\u201cPeople just amaze me,\u201d Pontin says.\n\nIn Croki, as some of her neighbours plan to leave their flood-prone homes, Michelle Bennett is grateful for the little things.\n\nWhile most of her furniture and many of her possessions have been ruined, it\u2019s not physical objects she holds on to. And, like Pontin, she is amazed by people\u2019s decency in the face of a crisis.\n\n\u201cA lot of stuff went, but I\u2019ve learnt it\u2019s the people, it\u2019s the memories that are so much more important than those things,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brought out a lot of beauty in people.\u201d\n\nGet alerts on significant breaking news as happens.

    "text": "At its peak, the use of Yeo in his usual Panthers link-man role in the 2022 decider had him passing 28 times, at a 1.65 ratio to every run he took. Hence the accusations of excessive \u2018Pantherisation\u2019 of the NSW attack by the end of Brad Fittler\u2019s tenure. In Fittler\u2019s defence, who wouldn\u2019t pick the key figures in the most dominant club side of the modern era, and permit them to play with the same distinct attacking structure that delivered Yeo, Nathan Cleary and Jarome Luai annual premiership rings? In time, though, Queensland learnt how to pick off the Penrith-esque sweeping shifts where Yeo linked to his club playmakers. Dane Gagai somehow furthered his \u2018Origin Gagai\u2019 alter-ego in 2022 by consistently swooping on those plays like he had the NSW game plan written down his forearm.\n\nHe didn\u2019t always make the tackle, but Gagai\u2019s rushing defence often did enough to stifle the Blues\u2019 plays. Club defences just weren\u2019t equipped to do that when Penrith pulled them out. Yeo\u2019s approach first changed under Michael Maguire last year, and continued to the extreme when Daley and the Blues returned to Suncorp. Along with Payne Haas, Yeo repeatedly punched over the advantage line, found his feet and a quick play-the-ball to generate crucial early momentum. \u201cThe ruck was pretty slow, so there was probably a struggle for momentum,\u201d Yeo said of his run-first mentality. \u201cWhich was a bit like the last series as well, so I don\u2019t think we were overthinking it or anything, just playing the game that was in front of us.\n\n\u201cThat was the style of footy needed I think. Try to get through the middle as much as we can. \u201cThat\u2019s probably more the nature of Origin footy I think, certainly [Wednesday night] was pretty middle-focused and that grinding style of game.\u201d Daley agreed, but stressed Yeo is still welcome to give the ball air when he sees fit. The pairing of Mitchell Moses as a second dominant playmaker alongside Cleary naturally switches the skipper back to a run-first 13, though.\n\n\u201cI think having two halves like Nath and Mitch and the way they play, like to be on-ball, it does bring \u2018Yeoy\u2019s\u2019 running game out,\u201d Daley said. \u201cI think it was a case of him mixing it up and playing what suited and the more that he can mix it up, the better. It did really help everyone, those carries of his. \u2018Yeoy\u2019 and Payne got us over the advantage line so often, it was a great captain\u2019s knock from him. \u201cAnd if the defence tries to jam him, he can still pass and add that depth to the attack, which he\u2019s so good at doing. And opportunities do come off the back of that too. \u201cI think he knows the balance in his game better than anyone.\u201d\n\nYeo\u2019s running game also had an impact on an underdone Maroons hooker Harry Grant, who was targeted like rarely before in a match. \u201cThat was probably the worst game I\u2019ve seen Harry play,\u201d Johns offered after Grant was uncharacteristically frustrated, mistake-prone and fatigued by 43 tackles in 58 minutes. Knackered: Queensland hooker Harry Grant. Credit: Getty Images Again, Yeo noted that going after the opposition hooker and dialling up his defensive workload is hardly rocket science, even by rugby league standards. But Grant came into Origin I with just one Storm game under his belt after a six-week hamstring injury. And Yeo especially went looking for him, just as Daley\u2019s last Origin side failed to find an injured Thurston all those years ago.\n\n\u201cThere was a little of looking for Harry and that\u2019s because he\u2019s such a good player, I think you\u2019ll find most teams try to wear him out in defence,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cBut this sort of game, if someone hasn\u2019t played a lot of footy, you probably do really try to dial that up and target someone as much as you can. \u201cMost hookers will lead the tackle count though and that\u2019s probably just how the game went with the middle focus.\u201d And as for the Pantherisation of NSW, the Blues treatment of Queensland\u2019s dummy-half heartbeat followed the same script Penrith deployed in last year\u2019s grand final triumph.\n\nLoading Grant tackled himself to a standstill for Melbourne that night with 59 tackles in 80 minutes, a defensive workload the Blues replicated before Billy Slater gave his exhausted hooker a breather. Of all the exhaustive Origin analysis, Daley\u2019s sound selection moves delivering a cherished win in Brisbane ring truest. So too does the promise of more cohesion between Moses and Cleary after their first game as a halves pairing. The prospect of earlier ball to edge weapons Latrell Mitchell and Stephen Crichton in Perth, where NSW have rattled up 38 and 44 points the previous two times they\u2019ve visited, is especially tantalising. Particularly when they get the balance of game smarts and game plan right.",

We have to move. We\u2019ve got two weeks to pull this off.\u201d That\u2019s where Barbieri caught Hepworth\u2019s desperate plea and flicked it onto Dumont, whose season with the Glory had just concluded. \u201cI thought, why not?\u201d Dumont says. \u201cIt\u2019d be a great way to expand my knowledge and learn something new.

That was four weeks ago. A week later, Dumont was in Adelaide for a one-day training camp to meet her new teammates; they knew she was in the room before she\u2019d announced herself, thanks to their heightened other senses. \u201cIt was pretty cool. That was a learning thing for me,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd last week, Dumont flew direct from Dubai, where she managed to squeeze in a short holiday break, to Japan, and wore the gloves at the IBSA Blind Football Grand Prix as the Bilbies chased their first-ever world ranking. Casey Dumont and the Bilbies celebrate. Credit: Haruo Wanibe/JBFA \u2018We just want to be included\u2019 Australia\u2019s women\u2019s blind football team was founded in 2014, and their nickname - the \u2018Bilbies\u2019 - couldn\u2019t be more fitting. Like the kangaroo, the bilby is a native marsupial, linking them symbolically to the Socceroos, Matildas and other national sides. But more poignantly, the bilby itself is also vision-impaired, and relies on its other senses to get by.\n\nIndeed, getting by remains a challenge. The team is not directly affiliated with Football Australia, and they are entirely self-funded; they were only able to get to Japan last week on the back of a GoFundMe page. Nobody is getting paid. For Hepworth, the trip is costing $2500. \u201cWe\u2019re wearing Macron, not Nike,\u201d says Hepworth. \u201cOur sponsor is not aligned with Football Australia because we just haven\u2019t been able to receive the buy-in from them. We\u2019re not trying to slam Football Australia, we just want to be included. But I\u2019m sure with Heather [Garriock, interim CEO] at the helm and Casey in the goals, we can sort that out.\u201d The Bilbies hope to compete at the Paralympics in 2028 but that, too, is out of their hands. Only men\u2019s blind football is currently part of the program; a decision on the inclusion of the women is set to be made in June. Dumont wants to be there with them, and is hopeful her next A-League club is understanding and open to it contractually. Her involvement with the Bilbies is believed to be a world-first for women\u2019s blind football; while most nations try to import the best goalkeepers they can, none has gone as far as bringing in a decorated former international who has won three A-League championships, an Asian Cup in 2010, went to a World Cup in 2011, and has a fearsome reputation as a penalty-stopping specialist.\n\nCasey Dumont and the Bilbies. Credit: Haruo Wanibe/JBFA They finished third at the IBSA Blind Football Grand Prix, beating England 1-0 in the third-place match. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to put my green and gold back on,\u201d Dumont says. \u201cI can\u2019t really say that because [as a goalkeeper] I don\u2019t wear green and gold, but what I mean is that I\u2019m really excited that I\u2019m able to represent my country again. It\u2019s a great opportunity, but it\u2019s also so fulfilling. \u201cIf I can help this team go far and grow and learn and expand, and be involved in so many more tournaments and championships, then that\u2019s the biggest reward of it all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be amazing to be able to tick off a Paralympics, but I\u2019m looking at the smaller goals, and that\u2019s just getting the funding that\u2019s needed for this Bilbies team, getting them involved as many tournaments as they can, helping the girls grow and competing against some of the best teams in the world. Because we have a very young team and I can\u2019t wait to see what this team is like in five years\u2019 time. If this is what they\u2019re like after being together for a couple of months \u2026 they\u2019re going to be phenomenal.\u201d Away from football, Dumont is a nurse.

Reports say the writer excelled for Algiers Racing Uni\u2019s First XI, but I have my doubts. Imagine relying on Albert as your last line of defence, the bloke spouting stuff like, \u201cThe only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone\u201d. Or: \u201cAn intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself\u201d.\n\nWake up, Albie! The ball is coming! Tuberculosis intervened, sadly, the goalie trading gloves for philosophy, plus those olive-green novels \u2013 The Stranger, The Fall \u2013 that ask the big questions. Each title has been a staple of high school and Existentialism 101.\n\nNot that Camus used the term. Indeed he rejected the e-word, preferring instead to forge fables around the incomprehensibility of existence. As that\u2019s the central plank, that irksome query about why we\u2019re here, and what we should do about it. \u201cMan is the only creature who refuses to be what he is,\u201d as Camus said. Which makes you wonder what we\u2019re meant to be.\n\nCathy Wilcox\u2019s cartoon. Credit:\n\nPrecisely the conundrum heard in Canberra this month. Is it any wonder? How can a power bloc of two parties implode into a rabble, losing seats like musical chairs, going from Coalition to Noalition?

Question being, are Mama Ley and Papa Littleproud going through a break-up, or merely a break? Either way, whether this new reunion lasts, the existentialism burns deep, fanned by those pesky Camus questions.",

    "text": "Posting on his social media platform X, Musk has indicated his disappointment with the unwillingness of Republicans to carry out spending cuts, musing that the only way out of the \u201cbankruptcy of America\u201d is to radically boost GDP growth. It\u2019s difficult to disagree with his assessment, or to find much reason for optimism in either Britain or America. Trump and Starmer are very different leaders leading very different countries, but they face the same core question: how do you keep the show on the road when your voters demand more spending? The demographic challenges facing both countries are well known: an older population has more voters who no longer work, who vote themselves a larger share of income, which increases fiscal pressure on the young and weighing on birth rates.\n\nLoading It\u2019s a doom-loop that the West\u2019s democracies have yet to find an escape from. Growing our way out of trouble would require a technological revolution. Older voters prioritise healthcare and pensions ahead of investment in infrastructure or education, which reduces the funds available for pro-growth policies. Worse still, redistribution requires taxation that directly weighs on economic activity. If Musk succeeds in solving AI, robotics and space exploration, then we might get the resources and growth we need to escape the spiral, just as the Industrial Revolution pulled us out of the Malthusian trap. If he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll need another way out of this mess. Solving demographics isn\u2019t the answer. Boosting birth rates is a necessary long-term fix, but doesn\u2019t address the more pressing present concerns.\n\nShort of drawing on Jonathan Swift\u2019s A Modest Proposal and rendering workers into Soylent Green at retirement age, there\u2019s no obvious policy that will. And if we\u2019re stuck with our inverted pyramid of people, that leaves us with \u201cdemocracy\u201d as the factor most likely to give way. About 48 per cent of all UK public spending goes on welfare, health and social care and debt interest spending. These are the items of spending that are either too toxic to touch \u2013 imagine the outrage if Starmer stood up and announced an end to the triple lock, or swinging cuts to the bloated NHS \u2013 or would tip the country into a financial crisis via defaulting on our obligations. The UK and US both have older populations with more voters who no longer work, who want a larger share of income. Credit: Bloomberg They\u2019re also some of the items with the most forecast growth, as today\u2019s young become tomorrow\u2019s old. The state pension is set to hit 8 per cent of GDP, health spending 15 per cent and adult social care somewhere about 2.5 per cent. A little over 25 pence in every pound earned in Britain will be earmarked for these line items alone. If we can\u2019t cut spending democratically, we\u2019ll be made to cut it. And cutting spending democratically is hard.\n\nLoading One implication of the median voter theorem \u2013 the observation that in a democratic system, the man in the middle tends to get his way \u2013 is that when median incomes are below the mean, the state will tend to engage in more redistribution. This is certainly true in Britain, where 53 per cent of the population lives in households that pay less in taxes than they receive in benefits, and it\u2019s likely to be true in the United States as well (where the top and bottom quintiles are net losers and net beneficiaries, respectively). In fact, \u201cdemocracies spend more\u201d seems to be a good general rule. Match V-Dem democracy scores to IMF data and \u2013 with some caveats around matching names and entries \u2013 the general gist is that more democratic countries spend somewhere about 12-15 points of GDP more than their less democratic peers, with researchers emphasising spending on social protection and education. Combine this with the observation that it\u2019s entirely possible for older generations to burden their younger successors with debts, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe incentives given to today\u2019s politicians are to spend to win today\u2019s votes. Unless voters today are altruistic about future generations \u2013 and when the population is ageing because fewer people have children, their motive to be so is greatly reduced \u2013 then you can end up in the sort of unsustainable spiral Britain and America have found themselves in. By 2055, the US national debt is expected to be 156 per cent of GDP, and deficits around 7 per cent. In Britain, it\u2019s for 130 per cent of GDP, and a deficit of 9 per cent. Project that out to 2073, and debt hits 274 per cent of GDP, with the deficit a healthy 21 per cent of national income. If politicians ignore the warning signs \u2013 or voters punish those who attempt to correct course \u2013 we could find the choice between debt and democracy made for us. These are ludicrous numbers. There is no prospect of funding that sort of deficit at that sort of debt. The question is what we\u2019ll get instead. The most likely answer seems to be some form of fiscal cliff-edge ending up with less democratic choice in government. This could take a \u201csoft\u201d form, such as self-imposed restrictions on spending and debt which politicians agree to adhere to in order to restore market confidence.\n\nA souped-up form of the Office for Budget Responsibility and harsher fiscal rules would be one version of this. Government by bond market \u2013 where investors demand higher yields for risky policies, driving the state towards fiscal consolidation \u2013 would be another. Loading At the other end of the scale, a debt bailout would effectively cede a large degree of sovereignty to whichever institution sets the terms of the loan. Britain has been down this road before, in 1976, when the IMF imposed higher taxes and lower spending. This would be an extreme outcome. It is not entirely out of the range of possibilities. Cutting spending democratically is hard. Undermining institutions is relatively easy.",

So, always, whether it was me in the role, Steve Hocking, Mark Evans before that, Adrian Anderson before him, then Andrew Demetriou, there has always been tension with the clubs. But, no, it\u2019s not a gender thing. \u201cLaura has broken down a lot of barriers. She is an incredibly talented administrator, and she will continue to be incredibly successful and a great help for me and a great help for the team going forward.\u201d Kane will oversee the delivery of the AFL, AFLW, VFL and VFLW seasons, and take charge of a newly formed health and medical team that will handle the AFL\u2019s response to mental health and concussion issues. She will also be the executive leading the AFLW. Dillon is hunting for a new EGM of football performance, who will be responsible for the match review office, umpiring, game analysis and player movement, laws of the game, innovation, and the AFL\u2019s football engagement with its 18 clubs.\n\nLoading Dillon conceded Kane may have been set up to fail because of the wide scope of her original remit. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. But what I did, I have been in the role now for 18 months \u2026 having a look at how we are going, and just seeing the complexity now in the football operations department, I made the call, football is at the heart of everything we do,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cYou make your decisions around that. When I, after 18 months, looking at my team and how best we are to succeed, having two roles on the executive with a focus on football was really important to me... We also do a lot of other stuff but footy is at the heart of it. Laura is a member of the AFL executive, she has an incredibly important job.\u201d Executive general manager of inclusion and social policy Tanya Hosch will depart the AFL on June 6, while Stephen Meade will continue to be the league\u2019s general counsel, but no longer sit on the executive team.\n\nThe integrity portfolio will move to the remit of the incoming chief operating officer. Western Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains, Fremantle counterpart Simon Garlick and Sydney chief Tom Harley are in contention for that role. Two pride rounds in \u2018flexible\u2019 AFLW fixture The AFLW season has been brought forward and will feature 12 rounds over 12 weeks for the first time and adopt what the league has dubbed a flexible fixture framework. The schedule for the league\u2019s tenth season was released in full on Friday, with the campaign opening with a throwback clash between Carlton and Collingwood under lights at Ikon Park on Thursday, August 14. On the same night, West Coast will host Gold Coast in Perth. The Eagles announced on Thursday that midfielder Jess Hosking would sit out the season for personal reasons.\n\n\u201cWhile this has been a difficult decision it is the right time for me to take a break from football for personal reasons,\u201d said Hosking, who was recruited from Richmond and has also played for Carlton. \u201cI wish [coach] Daisy [Pearce] and the girls the best of luck for the season ahead.\u201d This season will be the first time since the competition expanded to 18 teams that it has launched during the men\u2019s home-and-away campaign, with rounds one and two of AFLW coinciding with rounds 23 and 24 of the AFL. To ensure supporters can watch both fixtures, AFL head of strategy and scheduling Josh Bowler has introduced provisions for slight time changes if the match windows for a club are within one hour of overlapping.\n\n\u201cGiven this is the first time we\u2019ve launched the AFLW season within the men\u2019s home-and-away season with all 18 teams, it was important to ensure fans can support both teams during the crossover, so we\u2019ve introduced a flexible fixture framework for W games. Loading \u201cThis will only come into play if one club\u2019s AFL and AFLW match windows are within one hour of overlapping, then we may have a slight time change to make sure one finishes before the other starts. \u201cFurther to that, if a club is hosting two home games over one weekend, these will fall on different days to ensure the club can operationally deliver the best possible match-day experience for fans across two venues.\u201d This change comes after the Western Bulldogs had a fixture clash last season when the men\u2019s elimination final at the MCG corresponded with the women\u2019s home opener against Port Adelaide at the Whitten Oval. The women\u2019s match was later switched to the MCG where they played as the curtain raiser.",

    "text": "In the changing rooms later, Queensland players were carrying their babies just like NSW players were. Nobody was destroying walls or slamming doors. Billy Slater looked morose, but morose like the only single dad at a kids\u2019 birthday party. The rest of the players were chatting, having a drink, putting it all behind them. I know we\u2019ve heard this before, but look at the depth of talent Laurie Daley was able to leave out. He had the luxury of omitting four of the most destructive forwards in the NRL in Keaon Koloamatagi, Stefano Utoikamanu, Terrell May and Haumole Olakau\u2019atu. He didn\u2019t need Api Koroisau. He didn\u2019t even have to think about Jake Trbojevic. NSW winger Brian To\u2019o celebrates after scoring a try. Credit: Getty Images He could overlook Jarome Luai, Campbell Graham, James Tedesco and Ryan Papenhuyzen. His selections and style of play were more conservative than the National Party. He has a whole Origin second team in reserve, and a new generation ahead with the likes of Ethan Strange, Mark Nawaqanitawase, Jacob Preston, Blake Steep, and who knows, one day Lachlan Galvin.\n\nDepth? He\u2019s drowning in it. Queensland, meanwhile, are spoilt for lack of choice. Tom Dearden for Daly Cherry-Evans: is that it? \u201cMobility\u201d in the middle forwards eventually came to mean \u201ctoo small\u201d. They were being pushed back on Wednesday before they started giving away penalties.\n\nTino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, their best big man, responded to being dominated by trying to separate NSW players\u2019 heads from their necks. This tactic used to work in Origin but now it just means penalties, backpedalling, exhaustion. Cherry-Evans and Kalyn Ponga play behind beaten packs most weeks; Wednesday was more of the same. So. Is it really happening, and if it is, what are the structural causes behind it? One is rugby league\u2019s increasing control of raw violence. The on-paper Origin always failed to eventuate because Queensland compensated for their shallower talent pool with their power to intimidate. Even in the era of Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston and the other galacticos, they had their Josh McGuires and their Nate Myles, their Felise Kaufusis, their Josh Papaliis and their Matt Scotts. Out wide, they had Will Chambers and Dane Gagai. It\u2019s easy to forget that in their almost uninterrupted success from 2006 to 2017, their pack was repeatedly written off and they won as much through primitivism as polish. Now that whacking people is a liability, Queensland lose one of their advantages. Not that NSW didn\u2019t whack Queenslanders too, but Queenslanders did it better.\n\nThe current Queensland team is being criticised, up north, as \u201ctoo nice\u201d. Nobody likes being called too nice, but the curbs on brutality and the close attention of video referees have hurt Queensland more than Les Boyd or Paul Gallen ever did. Another change is cultural. After a generation of effort, NSW have managed to find the darkness within. Through their old boys\u2019 stories of humiliation, their baseball bats, their misery on Caxton Street, the Blues have discovered, or manufactured, a chip on their inside shoulder. On Wednesday, the hatred seemed to be flowing against the laws of nature. A third structural change is the conversion of young players to a NSW-first mentality. This loyalty used to be Queensland\u2019s, but the NSW hierarchy is now spotting talent early and bringing it into Origin camps, which now indoctrinate youngsters like Crusader Camps. Maybe the turning point was the widespread belief that Macksville\u2019s Greg Inglis played for Queensland because he wanted to. NSW lost a generational player when he gravitated towards passion and a perception (unique to rugby league) that Queensland treated Indigenous players better. To see Latrell Mitchell being won over to the NSW-first cause is to see a shift that may prevent the Inglis situation from being repeated.\n\nAfter 43 years, maybe NSW have found a way to tap their bigger talent pool. Yeah, I know. Having committed these thoughts to print, I do realise that Queensland will now win in Perth and Sydney. And we\u2019ll reassess game one and realise that if a few penalties and six-again calls had gone the other way, if one ball wasn\u2019t dropped, one tackle wasn\u2019t missed, then the momentum reversed and history changed. Instead, NSW succumbed to hubris, which should be reserved for spectators and journalists. Loading But until then, let\u2019s say that the thing has happened and Queensland have run out of their magic. It\u2019s happened before: from 1990 to the early 2000s, the Blues won 10 Origin series to Queensland\u2019s four. Losing made Queensland more like Queensland. They said that NSW dominance would kill Origin. The league imagined how to change eligibility rules, to get non- Queenslanders into maroon jerseys. Anticipating that it might be happening again, already the NRL has spoken of the wealth of Kiwi and Pasifika players who are sitting watching the game\u2019s mid-season showcase. Eventually, the show needs Queenslanders to win again and if that means putting New Zealand and Tonga in Queensland, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see. But it might take time, and NSW should enjoy that time while it lasts. Especially if it\u2019s only a couple of weeks.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 48 hours of uncertainty over Trump's tariffs, little is resolved, but one thing is clear: the global trade war is far from over.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House is announcing multiple new trade deals are on the way, this news breaking in a whirlwind of conflicting headlines as the Trump Administration fights the Federal Court over an attempt to block tariffs on international imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, has described the court order to Fox News as an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This trade negotiation season has been really, really effective for the American people. And it's unfortunate that people would attack it, as the journalists did or the way the judges just did. You know, these activist judges are trying to slow down something right in the middle of really important negotiations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOvernight, the White House made a successful appeal against the Federal Court order blocking the President's international tariff order.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to press pause on the U-S Court of International Trade's decision to block tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means the trade penalties are still in play - for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe block on tariffs could be reinstated, but White House Trade Advisor Pete Navarro says whatever roadblocks are thrown in their way - he and his colleagues will overcome them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So look, the tariff, the tariffs remain in place. The court told us, they didn't all but tell us, they told us go do it another way. So you can assume that even if we lose, we will do it another way. And I can assure the American people that the Trump tariff agenda is alive, well, healthy, and will be implemented to protect you, to save your jobs and your factories, and to stop shipping foreign wealth, our wealth into foreign hands.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket analysts, including Ballast Rock Private Wealth's [[Portfolio Manager]] Jim Carroll, are reporting to investors with this assurance: if you're confused, so are we.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just impossible to decipher all of these shenanigans. You really either need to be a long-term investor and just turn off the television, or you have to be a very active trader. Anything in between, you're really setting yourself up for problems. We have tried to communicate to clients that this is an environment in which discipline is going to be tested.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Spindel is chief investment officer of Potomac River Capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think markets are just going to continue to be caught in this pinball machine of court decisions, executive orders and judicial reviews.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n50 Park Investments' Adam Sarhan has urged investors to keep calm and carry on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a secondary thing even, though it's capturing the headlines right now. Investors are looking forward. Trump has already rolled back most of these tariffs anyway, so these court rulings are just headlines. Trump probably prepared an appeal before the ruling even came out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nU-S tariffs remain a bargaining chip as trade talks continue on the world stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has continued its push for an exemption to the penalties, with Australian goods currently subject to a 10 per cent baseline tariff and all steel and aluminium imports to the U-S hit with 25 per cent tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia brings more American products on-shore than it exports to the U-S - a factor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has previously said should mean it is exempt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut President Trump's so-called' best friend' Britain is in a similar position - and did not manage to shake off 10 per cent penalties on most of its imports to the U-S.\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Reinsch is a senior advisor to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, and says countries hoping for reprieve may be disappointed.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A federal appeals court has reinstated the most sweeping of United States President Donald Trump's tariffs, a day after a trade court ruled Trump exceeded his authority in imposing the duties and ordered an immediate block on them.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn order from the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington provided no opinion or reasoning but directed the plaintiffs in the case to respond by 5 June and the administration by 9 June.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US Court of International Trade had threatened to kill or at least delay the imposition of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on most US trading partners.\n\n\n\nWhat was the trade court ruling?\n\nThe trade court found Trump had overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from nations that sell more to the US than they buy.\n\n\n\nThe court said the US constitution gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate commerce with other countries which is not overridden by the president's emergency powers to safeguard the US economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 US states.\n\n\n\nTrump administration confident in tariffs\n\nSenior Trump administration officials said they were undeterred by the trade court's ruling, saying they expected either to prevail on appeal or use other presidential powers to ensure they go into effect.\n\n\n\nThe White House also said the ruling had not interfered with any negotiations with top trading partners scheduled for the days ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nA fourth round of talks with Japan is scheduled for Friday in Washington, and a trade negotiating team from India will head to the US next week for further discussions.\n\n\n\nHow have financial markets responded?\n\nFinancial markets, which have fluctuated wildly in response to every twist and turn in Trump's trade war, reacted with cautious optimism to the trade court ruling. But gains in stocks were largely limited by expectations that the court's ruling faced a potentially lengthy appeals process.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts said broad uncertainty remained regarding the future of Trump's tariffs, which have cost companies more than US$34 billion ($52.7 billion) in lost sales and higher costs, according to a Reuters analysis.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "If it feels like renting is more expensive these days, that's because it is.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows rents have been climbing steadily since the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 especially in capital cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some states, that means an increase of over $250 a week compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Renting has never been harder in Australia, especially in this state\n\nHow does your state compare?\n\nOver the past six years, rents have surged in every state and territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 2019, NSW and the ACT had the highest median rents at $480 per week. Fast forward to April 2025, and NSW still tops the list at $650 a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Australia has had the steepest rise in rents \u2014 jumping 75 per cent from $350 to $613 a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nTasmania has the lowest median rent, but even there, prices have climbed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTasmanians now pay $430 a week on average, up from $270 before the pandemic.\n\n\n\nWestern Australia has had the steepest rise in rents, but NSW has the highest median rental price. Source: SBS News Here's how median weekly rent looks across the country:\n\n\n\nNSW : $650 (Previously: $480)\n\nWestern Australia: $613 (Previously: $350)\n\nACT : $595 (Previously: $480)\n\nNorthern Territory: $560 (Previously: $430)\n\nQueensland : $560 (Previously: $380)\n\nVictoria : $520 (Previously: $385)\n\nSouth Australia: $495 (Previously: $325)\n\nTasmania : $430 (Previously: $270)\n\nRental inflation has finally slowed across capital cities \u2014 but it's still cheaper to live in regional areas. Source: SBS News\n\nIs living further from the CBD cheaper?\n\nWe've always known city living comes at a premium \u2014 but that dynamic briefly flipped during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now, rents in capital cities are still high \u2014 but that growth has started to slow. As of April 2025, annual rental inflation in capital cities has eased to around 5.5 per cent, down from a peak of 8.5 per cent in late 2023.\n\n\n\nBut that's still an increase from the pandemic era, where rents in capital cities actually fell. With international borders closed, temporary rent freezes, and a wave of people moving out, city demand dropped and vacancies rose.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, rents in regional areas rose, driven by people relocating and tighter supply.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile rents in some regional areas have caught up, it's still a more affordable rental option than the CBD \u2014 though the gap has narrowed in recent years.\n\n\n\nThe data says it could be cheaper to live just outside of the CBD. Source: SBS News\n\nShould you stay or should you go?\n\nMany renters are left wondering: in the face of rental hikes, is it cheaper to move or stay put?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data suggests rent increases have become both larger and more common since the pandemic \u2014 no matter if you move or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince mid-2022, the majority of properties (80-95 per cent) with new tenants saw rent hikes compared to the previous lease. This hit a high of 94 per cent in early 2023 and eased to 83 per cent in April 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting tenants haven't been spared either. Around 82 per cent of renters who stayed in place experienced a rent increase by late 2023.\n\n\n\nEven if you choose to stay, you might still be hit with a rental increase. Around 82 per cent of renters who stayed in place experienced a rent increase by late 2023. Source: SBS News\n\nWho's hit harder: movers or stayers?\n\nRent increases are usually bigger for those moving into a new property.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween June 2022 and June 2023:\n\n\n\n\n\n- 70 per cent of new tenants faced rent hikes of over 10 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Only 30 per cent of existing tenants had increases that steep.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in good news, more recently, rent hikes have started to ease.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of April 2025, 43 per cent of new tenants experienced a rent rise of more than 10 per cent, while 10 per cent of people saw no change.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong existing tenants, just under half (48 per cent) had a rent rise under 10 per cent, while one in four had no increase at all.\n\n\n\n",

But listening to the Australian people, not lecturing from the top down, listening from the ground up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's tough times for many Australians out there. We got a tough message from them at the last election, and we need to approach communities that we seek to represent with humility.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Back together again: a new Coalition deal after eight days apart SBS News 28/05/2025 04:43 Play\n\nWhy are there fewer women in the shadow ministry?\n\nLey unveiled the Coalition's new front bench on Wednesday, making several changes in the shadow ministry.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Ley is the Opposition's first female leader, the number of women in the cabinet has decreased compared to the previous term.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen questioned on this, Ley said 40 per cent of her cabinet is \"made up of women\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The party is led by a woman. When we make the calls that we need to, I will be at the table for every single one of those big calls,\" she told the ABC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 15 men and eight women in the new shadow cabinet, and 19 men and 11 women across the wider ministry. Peter Dutton's final shadow cabinet included 11 women and 12 men, and his wider ministry had 17 men and 13 women overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nJane Hume, former finance spokesperson, is one of the women who lost their role in the new Coalition cabinet.\n\n\n\nHume is known for her involvement in the Opposition's strategy during the elections to restrict work-from-home for public servants \u2014 a plan the Coalition ultimately ditched.\n\n\n\n\n\nLey said Hume's demotion was not related to this policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This isn't about who is sitting at what table and what role they have. It's broader than that ... It's about every one of the 54 members of our party room having a role to play,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is about putting the best team on the field and respecting Jane's talents ... The communication skills of so many of my team mean that they will feature prominently across the debate and carry that argument and that advocacy forward.\"\n\n\n\n'Last week was a messy week'\n\nFormer National Party leader Michael McCormack, who had been advocating for the reunification of the Coalition, said the parties \"shouldn't have split in the first place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Last week was a messy week ... It looked messy and people out in voter land must have looked and thought, what on earth are those people doing, naval-gazing, talking about themselves?\" he told ABC News Breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Liberals and Nationals have been very good, very, very good for decades, and it was madness that we separated, but it\u2019s taken a week, we\u2019re back together, and thankfully that is so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if Nationals leader David Littleproud had \"misled the party room\", McCormack said: \"We weren't told everything that went on between Sussan Ley and David [Littleproud], ... That was, I suppose, a thing that David chose to do,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe former party leader, who had previously criticised Littleproud's handling of the split, acknowledged that he approached Ley for the reunification.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen questioned about whether he had been punished for this by not being offered any frontbench positions, he said, \"you have to ask David Littleproud about that\".\n\n\n\n\n\nLittleproud has previously denied claims of vengeance, pointing out his plans on \"generational change\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to a question on whether he will lead the party again, McCormack said: \"You never say never.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A United States trade court has blocked Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs from going into effect, ruling that the president overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from nations that sell more to the US than they buy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Manhattan-based Court of International Trade said the US constitution gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate commerce with other countries that is not overridden by the president's emergency powers to safeguard the US economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the President's use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because [federal law] does not allow it,\" a three-judge panel said in the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 US states.\n\n\n\nThe companies, which range from a New York wine and spirits importer to a Virginia-based maker of educational kits and musical instruments, have said the tariffs will hurt their ability to do business.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least five other legal challenges to the tariffs are pending.\n\n\n\n\n\nOregon attorney-general Dan Rayfield, a Democrat whose office is leading the states' lawsuit, called Trump's tariffs unlawful, reckless and economically devastating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,\" Rayfield said in a statement.\n\n\n\nTrump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is meant to address \"unusual and extraordinary\" threats during a national emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the US or freeze their assets. Trump is the first US president to use it to impose tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe justice department has said the lawsuits should be dismissed because the plaintiffs have not been harmed by tariffs that they have not yet paid, and because only Congress, not private businesses, can challenge a national emergency declared by the president under IEEPA.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn imposing the tariffs in early April, Trump called the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his 10 per cent across-the-board tariffs on all imports, with higher rates for countries with which the US has the largest trade deficits, particularly China.\n\n\n\nMany of those country-specific tariffs were subsequently paused. The Trump administration announced on 12 May that it would also temporarily reduce the steepest tariffs on China while working on a longer-term trade deal. Both countries agreed to cut tariffs on each other for at least 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's on-and-off-again tariffs, which he has said are intended to restore US manufacturing capability, have shocked US financial markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US dollar rose against both the Swiss franc, a traditional currency safe-haven, and the Japanese yen following the court decision.\n\n\n\nAustralia responds to ruling\n\nAustralian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the government would study the ruling closely, noting the duties might be subject to further legal proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Albanese government has been consistent in the view that these tariffs on Australian imports into the US are unjustified,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will continue to engage and strongly advocate for the removal of tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trade court's decision can be appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, and ultimately the US Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like taking no for an answer. So really it comes as no surprise that, within minutes of three American judges blocking his tariffs from taking effect this week, he hit back with an appeal and questioned their authority.\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring that the Court of International Trade took a stand. The judges stopped short of passing judgment on the effectiveness or wisdom of tariffs, but ruled the president couldn\u2019t just use emergency powers in an (apparent) bid to protect the US economy. That power, it reminded Trump, actually rests with the Congress. The situation remains fluid, though; overnight a federal appeals court agreed to temporarily preserve the tariffs while the appeal is urgently held.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is used to getting his own way. Credit: Bloomberg\n\nNonetheless it\u2019s probably a bit awkward for Trump, given his No.1 rival \u2013 Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2013 won\u2019t have the same constraints on his power. Whether Xi pushes forward with tariffs on the US is unclear (he also has a lot to lose from imposing tariffs) but he may want to seize the opportunity to rub the mud in Trump\u2019s face at a time when the US president can\u2019t fight back.\n\nBut whether or not the court\u2019s finding withstands the appeal, Trump has (and will continue to) hurt businesses and customers worldwide \u2013 including here in Australia. Why? Because some of the damage has already been done.",

    "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s like glamping, but with more mud,\u201d Bennett says.\n\nSince then, the pair has relocated to a caravan parked outside while they slowly work to rebuild their lives. Metres away, the kettle and microwave on the front verandah is the closest they can get to a kitchen for now.\n\nWhen the swollen Manning River finally receded last week, Bennett and her partner, Mario Agius, returned from the refuge of their neighbour\u2019s home on higher ground to find every inch of floor covered in a thick, brown sludge swept in from the waterway, which reached a record height days earlier.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a mud-free house,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cI appreciate the small things in life now.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still some seeping through the floors and gaps in her Croki home, but the shovelling and hosing down is done, and she\u2019s in good spirits.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, most of the mud had been cleared from Michelle Bennett\u2019s house.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nIn the madness of cleaning up, she\u2019s lost her last hair tie and been left with an unruly mop for days.\n\nBennett is collecting donated clothes from Cundletown\u2019s community centre, just across the river from Taree, when the Herald speaks with her; without power or a working washing machine, she\u2019s been wearing the same clothes for days.\n\nLike Bennett and Agius, many in Croki, a village a few kilometres along the Manning north from Taree, were left without insurance after flooding in 2021 upped premiums by more than $30,000 per year.\n\nThe devastation has taken its toll, though. When the Manning River started swelling, it was exciting seeing how high the waterway would rise, Bennett says. Then came the adrenaline rush of preparing for the flood to hit. That, too, was quickly replaced with the reality of the destruction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get there, we\u2019ve still got a roof over our heads,\u201d Bennett says.\n\nWithout insurance, it will be a long, costly road back to normality for Bennett and Agius, who will be left thousands of dollars out of pocket to make their home \u201cflood friendly\u201d for the next time the Manning breaks its banks.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cIt\u2019s just Mother Nature doing her thing at the moment.\u201d\n\nBennett and Agius know the risks of staying put on the banks of the Manning after two major floods in the past four years, but haven\u2019t once considered leaving their home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what our community does to pitch together to help,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cDifferent people in the community have been doing all different sorts of things. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nDozens of bags of Bennett and Agius\u2019 muddied clothes and bed linen have been picked up by neighbours and volunteers to be washed since the roads cleared.\n\nSoon, though, a volunteer at the community centre is on the hunt for a pack among the piles of gifted goods.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one, and I lost it the other night,\u201d Bennett laughs.\n\nUglow was one of only a few of Croki\u2019s few dozen residents whose homes weren\u2019t inundated when the Manning rose. Some had just finished renovating their homes after the 2021 flood battered the village; almost all lost their cars in both floods. This time around, the water stopped two millimetres short of flowing into the Uglows\u2019 home.\n\nThe main driver for moving, Uglow says, is the unaffordable insurance costs that leave locals vulnerable to losing everything each time the village floods.\n\nKile Nicholas checks on Phil Lorking, 80, in the isolated village of Croki last week. Credit: Kate Geraghty\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t do it again,\u201d Uglow says from beside a bonfire locals have gathered around nightly to keep morale high since the water receded.\n\nToby Uglow, who has lived with his wife, Rachel, in Croki since 2006, says while his home was spared any damage in this flood, some of the village\u2019s less fortunate long-term residents have decided to move on.\n\nTheir neighbours, though, are less optimistic and grappling with the decision to stay or go.\n\nThe lessons learnt there in the past three years could go a long way to better preparing the Mid North Coast, and towns like Taree, for the next natural disaster, says Elizabeth Mossop, the head of Living Lab Northern Rivers.\n\nMeanwhile just over four hours up the highway from Taree, Lismore has been on its own slow and winding road to recovery since the historic 2022 floods that left much of the town underwater and destroyed homes and businesses.\n\nWaters have mostly receded but damage to roads and bridges still prevents access to some parts, with resupply operations continuing.\n\nAbout 3500 people remain isolated in six communities across the mid-north coast and Hunter regions, while about 700 homes and 400 other buildings have been deemed uninhabitable. More than 6000 insurance claims have been filed, about a quarter of them coming from the MidCoast council area. The floods have also claimed five lives.\n\n\u201cThe face of the village is going to change a fair bit after this one,\u201d Uglow says. \u201cIt is very sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are all going to be dealing with versions of the same problem, and if they can find a way to really work together, to share resources and expertise, that lays the foundation,\u201d Mossop says.\n\n\u201cThey are all going to have to make plans for recovery.\u201d\n\nMossop leads the collaboration between the University of Technology Sydney, Southern Cross University and the NSW Reconstruction Authority which is focused on designing a sustainable future for Lismore. It has offered to carry out a similar initiative on the Mid North Coast.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of if another large-scale flood hits the region, but when, Mossop says.\n\n\u201cWhat you hope, is that we can just translate those things very directly so that people are not trying to reinvent the wheel,\u201d Mossop says.\n\nFirst, though, the region will need to focus on its recovery.\n\nSecuring housing for those who were displaced or lost their homes in the floods, and getting businesses back-up and running is at the top of the list to achieve that, Mossop says.\n\n\u201cObviously, the priority has to be focused on helping to make people whole again,\u201d Mossop says.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think about the future while you\u2019re dealing with the disaster, but when we get to the situation where people are starting to think about how to go forward, that kind of planning has to take place with building in an understanding of what it is going to take to make these places more resilient into the future.\u201d\n\nBut, Mossop says, that planning doesn\u2019t just need to take place on the Mid North Coast.\n\n\u201cThere are very few places anywhere in Australia that have thought seriously about the kind of adaptation work to minimise the impacts of flooding,\u201d Mossop says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve thought about it, historically, in a kind of 20th century way of \u2018How can we defeat the floodwaters, how can we keep the floodwaters out of here?\u2019 And we\u2019re now dealing with a scale of events where that\u2019s not possible.\n\n\u201cWe have to think about it in this different way ... what can we do if the floodwaters are coming? What can we do to minimise the damage that they cause, to minimise threats to safety, and to minimise the period of disruption that is caused by these floods.\u201d\n\nLoading\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just floods, the regions\u2019 resilience against other disasters, including bushfires needs to be improved.\n\nWhat that looks like going forward is not yet clear.\n\nIn Lismore, a $900 million buyback scheme, under which homes in the city\u2019s most flood-prone areas have been bought by the NSW government, was introduced to move properties and people out of harm\u2019s way. No such scheme has been locked in for the Mid North Coast, but it is one of many options on the table.\n\nPlan and adapt\n\nMal Lanyon, chief executive of the NSW Reconstruction Authority, says authorities are working through disaster adaptation planning to understand the risks associated with each region, and what kind of mitigation can be put in place, so residents can live safely in communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about recovery, it\u2019s about trying to prevent the impacts of disasters before they happen, knowing that obviously we can\u2019t stop disasters in the types of rainfall that we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of weeks,\u201d Lanyon says.\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to say whether Taree and the Mid North Coast\u2019s recovery could be modelled on Lismore and the Northern Rivers, Lanyon says there have been significant lessons from the past few years, including how quickly clean-up started.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made significant strides,\u201d Lanyon says. \u201cWe had a plan in long before any of the water started to recede.\u201d\n\nBut, for all the lessons that were learnt from previous floods, there are many that weren\u2019t.\n\nSome locals in and around Taree say they were left in the dark about the scale of the disaster flowing down the Manning until it was too late, warned that the flooding would reach only minor to moderate levels. Instead, the river reached its highest levels since 1929.\n\nDuring some of the heaviest rainfall that hit Taree, three flood gauges immediately upstream from Taree were unavailable. If not for their own research and diligence after similar issues during the 2021 floods, Toby Uglow says, Croki residents would have been caught off guard by the record flooding.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says the gauges, which provide the weather bureau with real-time data on river levels, were unavailable at various times during the flooding due to a Telstra outage, but that its weather forecasts and warnings service is \u201cresilient and not dependent on any one piece of equipment\u201d.\n\n\u201cForecasts and warnings for all regions are based on a combination of many different observing systems including satellites, automatic weather stations, radars, rain gauges and hydrological monitoring stations. The composite nature of these systems allows specialist staff to monitor approaching weather and issue forecasts and warnings,\u201d the weather bureau said in a statement, adding that flood warnings for the Manning, Myall, Paterson, Williams and Hunter rivers had been in place for several days before the gauges were affected.\n\nPaul and Liz Brennan, who were helicoptered to safety from their flooded Oxley Island home across the river from Taree, say they only became aware of the severity of the flooding when it was too late to evacuate.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be another one of these examples where we were unable to provide people with effective advice about what was going to happen,\u201d Mossop says.\n\nRescued: Oaxley Island residents Liz Brennan, her husband Paul Brennan (second from right) and a neighbour (right). Credit: Kate Geraghty\n\nThe complete scale of the damage in these floods is not yet clear, but the impact is being tallied as the water recedes; across the Mid North Coast, water inundated more than 1100 homes, more than 15,000 cubic metres of flood debris has been cleared, and more than 1200 cattle carcasses, a number expected to increase, have been retrieved.\n\nOutside the major centres across both the Mid North Coast and Hunter regions, farmers have been hit as hard as anyone.\n\nIn Hinton, near Maitland in the Hunter, the Wilson family threw thousands of dollars of milk away when road closures that isolated the tiny town stopped trucks from reaching the farm.\n\nWith 200 of the farm\u2019s 250 acres underwater, the Wilsons lost all of their grazing paddocks they rely on to feed their 180-odd cattle. Until at least September they will have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on buying hay while they wait for the paddocks to dry and become workable again.\n\n\u201cThe farmers put so much into their land and care for their animals \u2026 there is a mental health component right through these sorts of incidents and impacts on those directly affected,\u201d Lanyon says.\n\nIt\u2019s farmers like the Wilsons who will be struggling to get up and keep going again, Lanyon says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got little doubt that some people, particularly primary producers who have been through this a number of times, are feeling despair,\u201d he says.\n\nLocals start the clean-up on Manning Street in Taree. Credit: Kate Geraghty\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re people that love their animals, they love working the land, and yet they\u2019ve found over the past few years, that they\u2019ve had repeated disasters, which has not only impacted on their income, but certainly on their lifestyle and on their animals.\u201d\n\nWhatever the way forward, planning for the next disaster needs to start now, MidCoast Mayor Claire Pontin says.\n\n\u201cWe are needing to have a discussion about where to from here,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is not a clear path.\u201d\n\nPontin is keen to start immediate talks with state and federal governments about what mitigation work can be done to help protect the Mid North Coast.\n\n\u201cIt is something that we need to start doing on behalf of the community,\u201d Pontin says.\n\n\u201cSome of our people now have just been flooded so many times they\u2019re tearing their hair out, and they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nLoading\n\nBut, through all the destruction, and despite the long road ahead, Pontin is hopeful the community will recover as it has done before.\n\n\u201cPeople just amaze me,\u201d Pontin says.\n\nIn Croki, as some of her neighbours plan to leave their flood-prone homes, Michelle Bennett is grateful for the little things.\n\nWhile most of her furniture and many of her possessions have been ruined, it\u2019s not physical objects she holds on to. And, like Pontin, she is amazed by people\u2019s decency in the face of a crisis.\n\n\u201cA lot of stuff went, but I\u2019ve learnt it\u2019s the people, it\u2019s the memories that are so much more important than those things,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brought out a lot of beauty in people.\u201d\n\nGet alerts on significant breaking news as happens.

    "text": "At its peak, the use of Yeo in his usual Panthers link-man role in the 2022 decider had him passing 28 times, at a 1.65 ratio to every run he took. Hence the accusations of excessive \u2018Pantherisation\u2019 of the NSW attack by the end of Brad Fittler\u2019s tenure. In Fittler\u2019s defence, who wouldn\u2019t pick the key figures in the most dominant club side of the modern era, and permit them to play with the same distinct attacking structure that delivered Yeo, Nathan Cleary and Jarome Luai annual premiership rings? In time, though, Queensland learnt how to pick off the Penrith-esque sweeping shifts where Yeo linked to his club playmakers. Dane Gagai somehow furthered his \u2018Origin Gagai\u2019 alter-ego in 2022 by consistently swooping on those plays like he had the NSW game plan written down his forearm.\n\nHe didn\u2019t always make the tackle, but Gagai\u2019s rushing defence often did enough to stifle the Blues\u2019 plays. Club defences just weren\u2019t equipped to do that when Penrith pulled them out. Yeo\u2019s approach first changed under Michael Maguire last year, and continued to the extreme when Daley and the Blues returned to Suncorp. Along with Payne Haas, Yeo repeatedly punched over the advantage line, found his feet and a quick play-the-ball to generate crucial early momentum. \u201cThe ruck was pretty slow, so there was probably a struggle for momentum,\u201d Yeo said of his run-first mentality. \u201cWhich was a bit like the last series as well, so I don\u2019t think we were overthinking it or anything, just playing the game that was in front of us.\n\n\u201cThat was the style of footy needed I think. Try to get through the middle as much as we can. \u201cThat\u2019s probably more the nature of Origin footy I think, certainly [Wednesday night] was pretty middle-focused and that grinding style of game.\u201d Daley agreed, but stressed Yeo is still welcome to give the ball air when he sees fit. The pairing of Mitchell Moses as a second dominant playmaker alongside Cleary naturally switches the skipper back to a run-first 13, though.\n\n\u201cI think having two halves like Nath and Mitch and the way they play, like to be on-ball, it does bring \u2018Yeoy\u2019s\u2019 running game out,\u201d Daley said. \u201cI think it was a case of him mixing it up and playing what suited and the more that he can mix it up, the better. It did really help everyone, those carries of his. \u2018Yeoy\u2019 and Payne got us over the advantage line so often, it was a great captain\u2019s knock from him. \u201cAnd if the defence tries to jam him, he can still pass and add that depth to the attack, which he\u2019s so good at doing. And opportunities do come off the back of that too. \u201cI think he knows the balance in his game better than anyone.\u201d\n\nYeo\u2019s running game also had an impact on an underdone Maroons hooker Harry Grant, who was targeted like rarely before in a match. \u201cThat was probably the worst game I\u2019ve seen Harry play,\u201d Johns offered after Grant was uncharacteristically frustrated, mistake-prone and fatigued by 43 tackles in 58 minutes. Knackered: Queensland hooker Harry Grant. Credit: Getty Images Again, Yeo noted that going after the opposition hooker and dialling up his defensive workload is hardly rocket science, even by rugby league standards. But Grant came into Origin I with just one Storm game under his belt after a six-week hamstring injury. And Yeo especially went looking for him, just as Daley\u2019s last Origin side failed to find an injured Thurston all those years ago.\n\n\u201cThere was a little of looking for Harry and that\u2019s because he\u2019s such a good player, I think you\u2019ll find most teams try to wear him out in defence,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cBut this sort of game, if someone hasn\u2019t played a lot of footy, you probably do really try to dial that up and target someone as much as you can. \u201cMost hookers will lead the tackle count though and that\u2019s probably just how the game went with the middle focus.\u201d And as for the Pantherisation of NSW, the Blues treatment of Queensland\u2019s dummy-half heartbeat followed the same script Penrith deployed in last year\u2019s grand final triumph.\n\nLoading Grant tackled himself to a standstill for Melbourne that night with 59 tackles in 80 minutes, a defensive workload the Blues replicated before Billy Slater gave his exhausted hooker a breather. Of all the exhaustive Origin analysis, Daley\u2019s sound selection moves delivering a cherished win in Brisbane ring truest. So too does the promise of more cohesion between Moses and Cleary after their first game as a halves pairing. The prospect of earlier ball to edge weapons Latrell Mitchell and Stephen Crichton in Perth, where NSW have rattled up 38 and 44 points the previous two times they\u2019ve visited, is especially tantalising. Particularly when they get the balance of game smarts and game plan right.",

We have to move. We\u2019ve got two weeks to pull this off.\u201d That\u2019s where Barbieri caught Hepworth\u2019s desperate plea and flicked it onto Dumont, whose season with the Glory had just concluded. \u201cI thought, why not?\u201d Dumont says. \u201cIt\u2019d be a great way to expand my knowledge and learn something new. I reached out to Bess, we chatted, and then I basically worked out how I would be a part of it, and it made it work.\u201d\n\nCasey Dumont. Credit: Getty Images When the news was announced on the Bilbies\u2019 group chat - by Jude, Hepworth\u2019s deafblind and non-verbal son, who she described as one of the team\u2019s unofficial mascots - the response was euphoric. \u201cIt was just such a beautiful mutual opportunity for the girls to know that they have someone that\u2019s going to have their back,\u201d says Hepworth. That was four weeks ago. A week later, Dumont was in Adelaide for a one-day training camp to meet her new teammates; they knew she was in the room before she\u2019d announced herself, thanks to their heightened other senses. \u201cIt was pretty cool. That was a learning thing for me,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd last week, Dumont flew direct from Dubai, where she managed to squeeze in a short holiday break, to Japan, and wore the gloves at the IBSA Blind Football Grand Prix as the Bilbies chased their first-ever world ranking. Casey Dumont and the Bilbies celebrate. Credit: Haruo Wanibe/JBFA \u2018We just want to be included\u2019 Australia\u2019s women\u2019s blind football team was founded in 2014, and their nickname - the \u2018Bilbies\u2019 - couldn\u2019t be more fitting. Like the kangaroo, the bilby is a native marsupial, linking them symbolically to the Socceroos, Matildas and other national sides. But more poignantly, the bilby itself is also vision-impaired, and relies on its other senses to get by.\n\nIndeed, getting by remains a challenge. The team is not directly affiliated with Football Australia, and they are entirely self-funded; they were only able to get to Japan last week on the back of a GoFundMe page. Nobody is getting paid. For Hepworth, the trip is costing $2500. \u201cWe\u2019re wearing Macron, not Nike,\u201d says Hepworth. \u201cOur sponsor is not aligned with Football Australia because we just haven\u2019t been able to receive the buy-in from them. We\u2019re not trying to slam Football Australia, we just want to be included. But I\u2019m sure with Heather [Garriock, interim CEO] at the helm and Casey in the goals, we can sort that out.\u201d The Bilbies hope to compete at the Paralympics in 2028 but that, too, is out of their hands. Only men\u2019s blind football is currently part of the program; a decision on the inclusion of the women is set to be made in June. Dumont wants to be there with them, and is hopeful her next A-League club is understanding and open to it contractually. Her involvement with the Bilbies is believed to be a world-first for women\u2019s blind football; while most nations try to import the best goalkeepers they can, none has gone as far as bringing in a decorated former international who has won three A-League championships, an Asian Cup in 2010, went to a World Cup in 2011, and has a fearsome reputation as a penalty-stopping specialist.\n\nCasey Dumont and the Bilbies. Credit: Haruo Wanibe/JBFA They finished third at the IBSA Blind Football Grand Prix, beating England 1-0 in the third-place match. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to put my green and gold back on,\u201d Dumont says. \u201cI can\u2019t really say that because [as a goalkeeper] I don\u2019t wear green and gold, but what I mean is that I\u2019m really excited that I\u2019m able to represent my country again. It\u2019s a great opportunity, but it\u2019s also so fulfilling. \u201cIf I can help this team go far and grow and learn and expand, and be involved in so many more tournaments and championships, then that\u2019s the biggest reward of it all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be amazing to be able to tick off a Paralympics, but I\u2019m looking at the smaller goals, and that\u2019s just getting the funding that\u2019s needed for this Bilbies team, getting them involved as many tournaments as they can, helping the girls grow and competing against some of the best teams in the world. Because we have a very young team and I can\u2019t wait to see what this team is like in five years\u2019 time. If this is what they\u2019re like after being together for a couple of months \u2026 they\u2019re going to be phenomenal.\u201d Away from football, Dumont is a nurse. This isn\u2019t her first brush with disability - she has family experiences, too - but it is with vision-impairment, and the unique challenges that come with it. Loading She has begun to notice how much her teammates get stared at in public, or how few people actually move out of the way when someone is walking nearby with a cane. And she loves how ready they are to laugh at themselves and each other when someone stacks it. \u201cThey\u2019ve taught me so much,\u201d she says.",

    "text": "Posting on his social media platform X, Musk has indicated his disappointment with the unwillingness of Republicans to carry out spending cuts, musing that the only way out of the \u201cbankruptcy of America\u201d is to radically boost GDP growth. It\u2019s difficult to disagree with his assessment, or to find much reason for optimism in either Britain or America. Trump and Starmer are very different leaders leading very different countries, but they face the same core question: how do you keep the show on the road when your voters demand more spending? The demographic challenges facing both countries are well known: an older population has more voters who no longer work, who vote themselves a larger share of income, which increases fiscal pressure on the young and weighing on birth rates.\n\nLoading It\u2019s a doom-loop that the West\u2019s democracies have yet to find an escape from. Growing our way out of trouble would require a technological revolution. Older voters prioritise healthcare and pensions ahead of investment in infrastructure or education, which reduces the funds available for pro-growth policies. Worse still, redistribution requires taxation that directly weighs on economic activity. If Musk succeeds in solving AI, robotics and space exploration, then we might get the resources and growth we need to escape the spiral, just as the Industrial Revolution pulled us out of the Malthusian trap. If he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll need another way out of this mess. Solving demographics isn\u2019t the answer. Boosting birth rates is a necessary long-term fix, but doesn\u2019t address the more pressing present concerns.\n\nShort of drawing on Jonathan Swift\u2019s A Modest Proposal and rendering workers into Soylent Green at retirement age, there\u2019s no obvious policy that will. And if we\u2019re stuck with our inverted pyramid of people, that leaves us with \u201cdemocracy\u201d as the factor most likely to give way. About 48 per cent of all UK public spending goes on welfare, health and social care and debt interest spending. These are the items of spending that are either too toxic to touch \u2013 imagine the outrage if Starmer stood up and announced an end to the triple lock, or swinging cuts to the bloated NHS \u2013 or would tip the country into a financial crisis via defaulting on our obligations. The UK and US both have older populations with more voters who no longer work, who want a larger share of income. Credit: Bloomberg They\u2019re also some of the items with the most forecast growth, as today\u2019s young become tomorrow\u2019s old. The state pension is set to hit 8 per cent of GDP, health spending 15 per cent and adult social care somewhere about 2.5 per cent. A little over 25 pence in every pound earned in Britain will be earmarked for these line items alone. If we can\u2019t cut spending democratically, we\u2019ll be made to cut it. And cutting spending democratically is hard.\n\nLoading One implication of the median voter theorem \u2013 the observation that in a democratic system, the man in the middle tends to get his way \u2013 is that when median incomes are below the mean, the state will tend to engage in more redistribution. This is certainly true in Britain, where 53 per cent of the population lives in households that pay less in taxes than they receive in benefits, and it\u2019s likely to be true in the United States as well (where the top and bottom quintiles are net losers and net beneficiaries, respectively). In fact, \u201cdemocracies spend more\u201d seems to be a good general rule. Match V-Dem democracy scores to IMF data and \u2013 with some caveats around matching names and entries \u2013 the general gist is that more democratic countries spend somewhere about 12-15 points of GDP more than their less democratic peers, with researchers emphasising spending on social protection and education. Combine this with the observation that it\u2019s entirely possible for older generations to burden their younger successors with debts, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe incentives given to today\u2019s politicians are to spend to win today\u2019s votes. Unless voters today are altruistic about future generations \u2013 and when the population is ageing because fewer people have children, their motive to be so is greatly reduced \u2013 then you can end up in the sort of unsustainable spiral Britain and America have found themselves in. By 2055, the US national debt is expected to be 156 per cent of GDP, and deficits around 7 per cent. In Britain, it\u2019s for 130 per cent of GDP, and a deficit of 9 per cent. Project that out to 2073, and debt hits 274 per cent of GDP, with the deficit a healthy 21 per cent of national income. If politicians ignore the warning signs \u2013 or voters punish those who attempt to correct course \u2013 we could find the choice between debt and democracy made for us. These are ludicrous numbers. There is no prospect of funding that sort of deficit at that sort of debt. The question is what we\u2019ll get instead. The most likely answer seems to be some form of fiscal cliff-edge ending up with less democratic choice in government. This could take a \u201csoft\u201d form, such as self-imposed restrictions on spending and debt which politicians agree to adhere to in order to restore market confidence.\n\nA souped-up form of the Office for Budget Responsibility and harsher fiscal rules would be one version of this. Government by bond market \u2013 where investors demand higher yields for risky policies, driving the state towards fiscal consolidation \u2013 would be another. Loading At the other end of the scale, a debt bailout would effectively cede a large degree of sovereignty to whichever institution sets the terms of the loan. Britain has been down this road before, in 1976, when the IMF imposed higher taxes and lower spending. This would be an extreme outcome. It is not entirely out of the range of possibilities. Cutting spending democratically is hard. Undermining institutions is relatively easy.",

So, always, whether it was me in the role, Steve Hocking, Mark Evans before that, Adrian Anderson before him, then Andrew Demetriou, there has always been tension with the clubs. But, no, it\u2019s not a gender thing. \u201cLaura has broken down a lot of barriers. She is an incredibly talented administrator, and she will continue to be incredibly successful and a great help for me and a great help for the team going forward.\u201d Kane will oversee the delivery of the AFL, AFLW, VFL and VFLW seasons, and take charge of a newly formed health and medical team that will handle the AFL\u2019s response to mental health and concussion issues. She will also be the executive leading the AFLW. Dillon is hunting for a new EGM of football performance, who will be responsible for the match review office, umpiring, game analysis and player movement, laws of the game, innovation, and the AFL\u2019s football engagement with its 18 clubs.\n\nLoading Dillon conceded Kane may have been set up to fail because of the wide scope of her original remit. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. But what I did, I have been in the role now for 18 months \u2026 having a look at how we are going, and just seeing the complexity now in the football operations department, I made the call, football is at the heart of everything we do,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cYou make your decisions around that. When I, after 18 months, looking at my team and how best we are to succeed, having two roles on the executive with a focus on football was really important to me... We also do a lot of other stuff but footy is at the heart of it. Laura is a member of the AFL executive, she has an incredibly important job.\u201d Executive general manager of inclusion and social policy Tanya Hosch will depart the AFL on June 6, while Stephen Meade will continue to be the league\u2019s general counsel, but no longer sit on the executive team.\n\nThe integrity portfolio will move to the remit of the incoming chief operating officer. Western Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains, Fremantle counterpart Simon Garlick and Sydney chief Tom Harley are in contention for that role. Two pride rounds in \u2018flexible\u2019 AFLW fixture The AFLW season has been brought forward and will feature 12 rounds over 12 weeks for the first time and adopt what the league has dubbed a flexible fixture framework. The schedule for the league\u2019s tenth season was released in full on Friday, with the campaign opening with a throwback clash between Carlton and Collingwood under lights at Ikon Park on Thursday, August 14. On the same night, West Coast will host Gold Coast in Perth. The Eagles announced on Thursday that midfielder Jess Hosking would sit out the season for personal reasons.\n\n\u201cWhile this has been a difficult decision it is the right time for me to take a break from football for personal reasons,\u201d said Hosking, who was recruited from Richmond and has also played for Carlton. \u201cI wish [coach] Daisy [Pearce] and the girls the best of luck for the season ahead.\u201d This season will be the first time since the competition expanded to 18 teams that it has launched during the men\u2019s home-and-away campaign, with rounds one and two of AFLW coinciding with rounds 23 and 24 of the AFL. To ensure supporters can watch both fixtures, AFL head of strategy and scheduling Josh Bowler has introduced provisions for slight time changes if the match windows for a club are within one hour of overlapping.\n\n\u201cGiven this is the first time we\u2019ve launched the AFLW season within the men\u2019s home-and-away season with all 18 teams, it was important to ensure fans can support both teams during the crossover, so we\u2019ve introduced a flexible fixture framework for W games. Loading \u201cThis will only come into play if one club\u2019s AFL and AFLW match windows are within one hour of overlapping, then we may have a slight time change to make sure one finishes before the other starts. \u201cFurther to that, if a club is hosting two home games over one weekend, these will fall on different days to ensure the club can operationally deliver the best possible match-day experience for fans across two venues.\u201d This change comes after the Western Bulldogs had a fixture clash last season when the men\u2019s elimination final at the MCG corresponded with the women\u2019s home opener against Port Adelaide at the Whitten Oval. The women\u2019s match was later switched to the MCG where they played as the curtain raiser.",

    "text": "In the changing rooms later, Queensland players were carrying their babies just like NSW players were. Nobody was destroying walls or slamming doors. Billy Slater looked morose, but morose like the only single dad at a kids\u2019 birthday party. The rest of the players were chatting, having a drink, putting it all behind them. I know we\u2019ve heard this before, but look at the depth of talent Laurie Daley was able to leave out. He had the luxury of omitting four of the most destructive forwards in the NRL in Keaon Koloamatagi, Stefano Utoikamanu, Terrell May and Haumole Olakau\u2019atu. He didn\u2019t need Api Koroisau. He didn\u2019t even have to think about Jake Trbojevic. NSW winger Brian To\u2019o celebrates after scoring a try. Credit: Getty Images He could overlook Jarome Luai, Campbell Graham, James Tedesco and Ryan Papenhuyzen. His selections and style of play were more conservative than the National Party. He has a whole Origin second team in reserve, and a new generation ahead with the likes of Ethan Strange, Mark Nawaqanitawase, Jacob Preston, Blake Steep, and who knows, one day Lachlan Galvin.\n\nDepth? He\u2019s drowning in it. Queensland, meanwhile, are spoilt for lack of choice. Tom Dearden for Daly Cherry-Evans: is that it? \u201cMobility\u201d in the middle forwards eventually came to mean \u201ctoo small\u201d. They were being pushed back on Wednesday before they started giving away penalties.\n\nTino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, their best big man, responded to being dominated by trying to separate NSW players\u2019 heads from their necks. This tactic used to work in Origin but now it just means penalties, backpedalling, exhaustion. Cherry-Evans and Kalyn Ponga play behind beaten packs most weeks; Wednesday was more of the same. So. Is it really happening, and if it is, what are the structural causes behind it? One is rugby league\u2019s increasing control of raw violence. The on-paper Origin always failed to eventuate because Queensland compensated for their shallower talent pool with their power to intimidate. Even in the era of Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston and the other galacticos, they had their Josh McGuires and their Nate Myles, their Felise Kaufusis, their Josh Papaliis and their Matt Scotts. Out wide, they had Will Chambers and Dane Gagai. It\u2019s easy to forget that in their almost uninterrupted success from 2006 to 2017, their pack was repeatedly written off and they won as much through primitivism as polish. Now that whacking people is a liability, Queensland lose one of their advantages. Not that NSW didn\u2019t whack Queenslanders too, but Queenslanders did it better.\n\nThe current Queensland team is being criticised, up north, as \u201ctoo nice\u201d. Nobody likes being called too nice, but the curbs on brutality and the close attention of video referees have hurt Queensland more than Les Boyd or Paul Gallen ever did. Another change is cultural. After a generation of effort, NSW have managed to find the darkness within. Through their old boys\u2019 stories of humiliation, their baseball bats, their misery on Caxton Street, the Blues have discovered, or manufactured, a chip on their inside shoulder. On Wednesday, the hatred seemed to be flowing against the laws of nature. A third structural change is the conversion of young players to a NSW-first mentality. This loyalty used to be Queensland\u2019s, but the NSW hierarchy is now spotting talent early and bringing it into Origin camps, which now indoctrinate youngsters like Crusader Camps. Maybe the turning point was the widespread belief that Macksville\u2019s Greg Inglis played for Queensland because he wanted to. NSW lost a generational player when he gravitated towards passion and a perception (unique to rugby league) that Queensland treated Indigenous players better. To see Latrell Mitchell being won over to the NSW-first cause is to see a shift that may prevent the Inglis situation from being repeated.\n\nAfter 43 years, maybe NSW have found a way to tap their bigger talent pool. Yeah, I know. Having committed these thoughts to print, I do realise that Queensland will now win in Perth and Sydney. And we\u2019ll reassess game one and realise that if a few penalties and six-again calls had gone the other way, if one ball wasn\u2019t dropped, one tackle wasn\u2019t missed, then the momentum reversed and history changed. Instead, NSW succumbed to hubris, which should be reserved for spectators and journalists. Loading But until then, let\u2019s say that the thing has happened and Queensland have run out of their magic. It\u2019s happened before: from 1990 to the early 2000s, the Blues won 10 Origin series to Queensland\u2019s four. Losing made Queensland more like Queensland. They said that NSW dominance would kill Origin. The league imagined how to change eligibility rules, to get non- Queenslanders into maroon jerseys. Anticipating that it might be happening again, already the NRL has spoken of the wealth of Kiwi and Pasifika players who are sitting watching the game\u2019s mid-season showcase. Eventually, the show needs Queenslanders to win again and if that means putting New Zealand and Tonga in Queensland, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see. But it might take time, and NSW should enjoy that time while it lasts. Especially if it\u2019s only a couple of weeks.",

Source: Queensland government\n\nAs several councils across Australia move to limit where residents can park their caravans and trailers, and introduce red tape for landowners hosting short-stay travellers on their properties, one council has announced it's taking a decidedly different approach. It will formally allow people to park their motorhomes and tiny homes and live on private properties, in a measure aimed at offering some relief to the housing crisis.\n\nAcross Australia, several councils have recently introduced restrictions on where caravans and trailers can be parked, especially in residential areas, citing concerns about limited street parking and safety. Meanwhile a number of Queensland councils have made it harder for large land owners to accomodate farm stays for travellers in caravans.\n\nBut with a suffocating housing crisis gripping the country, the Shire of Manjimup, in Western Australia's southwest and taken the complete opposite tack.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News, Shire President Donelle Buegge said the council had adopted a policy that allows people to apply to live in caravans or tiny homes on wheels on private land for up to two years, offering a rare show of housing flexibility from local lawmakers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBack in August, the WA government announced reforms to the Caravan Parks and Camping Grounds Regulations Act, which came into effect in September. The changes allowed local governments to approve the use of caravans or tiny homes on wheels as temporary accommodation on private land for up to two years, with the possibility of renewal \u2013 something the council is now embracing.\n\nCaravans and tiny homes on wheels can now be permanently parked on private property for up to two years within the Shire of Manjimup LGA. Source: Getty/RAC\n\nAussie council praised for move to address housing shortage\n\nOn Tuesday, the Shire of Manjimup voted to enact the policy and to allow council greater discretion to approve applications from those who are ageing in place, or facing other personal circumstances that require temporary accommodation.\n\n\"The state government was very broad with what we could do, this now gives us the policies, it gives our officers clear guidelines,\" Buegge told Yahoo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"People can stay in tiny homes on wheels and caravans for up to two years as long as they meet health and safety requirements. As long as they have water, a place for waste to go, and things like that.\n\nBuegge said the region is under increasing strain from a \"huge housing shortage,\" with the rental market unable to keep up with demand.\n\n\"Every house that becomes available for rent is getting 30 to 35 applications. And we\u2019re not alone in this\u2014 it's happening everywhere,\" she said. \"But we don\u2019t have a short-term fix. I know of around 37 kids who are couch surfing right now because they can\u2019t stay at home while finishing school. Even just a small sense of stability can make a huge difference.\"\n\nBuegge said the new policy could provide that difference. \"This gives people a little bit of leeway, a little bit of security while we continue to work towards longer-term solutions. Having your own space, even temporarily, can do so much for someone\u2019s self-confidence and sense of safety.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe also acknowledged that she believes many people had already been living this way.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s already happening \u2014 people just don\u2019t talk about it because they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll be told to move on. This policy removes that fear and legitimises what, for some, is the only option,\" she said. \"If something this small can make life a bit easier for someone, then I think it\u2019s the least we can do.\"\n\nCaravan rule change follows same move by Queensland council\n\nIt comes as Lockyer Valley Regional Council, 90km west of Brisbane, announced last week residential use of caravans will now be permitted for up to six months in a 12-month period if the person is parked on a family or friend's property.\n\nThe change in that local government area means the landowner and the caravan occupant will not require council approval and this arrangement has been locked in until the end of 2027.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"While the state and federal governments carry the responsibility for meeting housing demand, allowing for the temporary use of caravans is a practical step local governments can take,\" Cheryl Steinhardt, Lockyer Council\u2019s Regulatory Services Councillor said.\n\n\"Not only does it benefit people waiting for a rental to become available or for a property to settle, it also supports people doing it tough.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?

Sometimes, you just need to know where to look.\n\nFor those travelling the continent like Mariella and Dougal, who are constantly on the lookout for animals, there's plenty to fill your days with. According to figures from the Australian federal Department of Environment, there is an estimated 566,000 living species in Australia, with only about 147,000 having been previously described.\n\n\"Since hitting the road, we've made it a mission to photograph every species we come across,\" Mariella told Yahoo News Australia.\n\n\"We're enthusiastic naturalists and passionate wildlife photographers, so any opportunity to document unique wildlife encounters is a real thrill for us.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd it's been a thrill they've been chasing for years now, joining the growing number of people in Australia that live a nomadic lifestyle.\n\n\"During Covid, we made the decision to buy a caravan and hit the road, and we haven\u2019t looked back since,\" she said.\n\nThe nomadic lifestyle provides plenty of opportunity to have wild encounters. Source: BrotherNatureOz/Facebook\n\nWhile Mariella is from Italy, she's been living in Australia for the past decade and met Dougal in his hometown of Airlie Beach in Queensland.\n\n\"We left Airlie Beach about four years ago and have been on the move ever since,\" she explained to Yahoo. \"We live full-time in our off-road caravan, which has been amazing. It gives us the freedom to change our backyard often.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe couple is currently in Katherine, in the Northern Territory, before heading to Darwin to begin some work. Mariella is a qualified teacher aide while Dougal is a carpenter but has just been hired as a nature guide.\n\n\"We usually take jobs that offer a place to park the van, or we connect with people happy to share their properties in exchange for a contribution.

      "Road Authorities To Remove Banksia Cones Highway"
    ],
    "text": "Endangered wildlife are being forced to 'run the gauntlet' for a good meal in a Perth suburb, outraging concerned residents.\n\nA grim video has emerged of what some locals have deemed a \u201cdeath trap\u201d in the middle of a busy Aussie highway, prompting a surprise response from road authorities.\n\nDean Arthurell was recently travelling on the Tonkin Highway near Ellenbrook, a suburb about 30 minutes north of Perth, when he saw several endangered black Carnaby\u2019s cockatoos feasting on banksias planted in the fenced centre refuge.\n\nWhile he first spotted the greenery when it was added about five years ago as part of a multi-million dollar upgrade, the founder of Carnaby's Crusaders told Yahoo News it wasn\u2019t until recently he noticed cockatoos were risking their lives to reach the now mature plants.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re producing banksia cones so that\u2019s why they\u2019ve obviously come to my attention, and obviously the birds\u2019 attention, because they\u2019re producing food,\u201d Arthurell said, adding he believes the shrubs are banksia prionotes, which are a significant food source for the species.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn a time where there is really lean food sources, to have an abundance of a key food source that stretches over 1km down the middle of a four-lane highway is a bit criminal.\u201d\n\nArthurell said the section in question sits in a 100km/h zone, baiting birds to \u201crun the gauntlet\u201d and dodge cars and large trucks in order to reach the sustenance. Remarkably, in light of the video, Main Roads WA told Yahoo News it has agreed to prune back the plants immediately and ensure their \u201ctotal removal\u201d soon after.\n\nPlacing a key food source that stretches over 1km down the middle of a four-lane highway is 'criminal', Arthurell said. Source: Carnaby's Crusaders\n\nRoad authorities to remove banksia cones from highway\n\nIn an effort to draw attention to the \u201cclueless\u201d landscaping, Arthurell posted footage of two Carnaby\u2019s cockatoos precariously perched in between vehicles whizzing past in both directions. The clip quickly angered thousands of locals, with many calling for the \u201cdangerous\u201d plants to be removed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd it seems, Main Roads WA is paying attention.\n\nThe bird advocate told Yahoo he received a call from authorities on Wednesday confirming contractors had been hired to remove the banksia cones that are attracting the birds. The work is expected to take place over the next few days, and the cuttings will be transported to a black cockatoo rehabilitation centre, he said.\n\n\u201cMain Roads was alerted, via a Facebook post, regarding Black Cockatoos foraging along Tonkin Highway in Ellenbrook,\u201d a spokesperson told Yahoo, explaining that the presence of the trees \"had not been an issue\u201d until recently.\n\n\u201cThis is likely due to the plants not being old enough to flower as prolifically as they are now, as well as the lack of food availability in the local area for Black Cockatoos (especially given the last two very dry years we have experienced).\n\n\u201cAs the flowering Dwarf Banksias at this location are attracting these important birds to fly across Tonkin Highway, Main Roads has arranged for the Dwarf Banksias to be heavily pruned back immediately, followed by the total removal of all foraging species from the median and the edges of the verge.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMain Roads said it will be donating the pruned branches to the Kaarakin Black Cockatoo Conservation Centre to support their rehabilitation work. Arthurell said \u201cit's great\u201d that Main Roads listened to public outcry about the banksias.\n\nThe state\u2019s southwest is home to three threatened black cockatoo species: the endangered Carnaby\u2019s cockatoo, the critically endangered Baudin\u2019s cockatoo and the Forest Red-tailed black cockatoo, which is listed as vulnerable.\n\nConservationists have warned that if declining numbers are not turned around, all three could be extinct within 20 years.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
