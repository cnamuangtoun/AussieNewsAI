    "text": "A gleaming blue, 7-metre-tall astronaut has been unveiled in Perth's CBD, taking pride of place outside Council House.\n\nDesigned by US artist Brendan Murphy, the sculpture called Boonji Spaceman was a donation by the artist but City of Perth took on costs of transportation and installation, believed to be between $150,000\u2013$250,000.\n\nThe acquisition was championed by former Perth Lord Mayor Basil Zempilas who stepped down from the council in March after being elected to state parliament.\n\nMr Zempilas has long championed branding Perth as the City of Light \u2014 as it was dubbed by astronaut John Glenn in 1962 when the people of Perth turned on their lights to acknowledge his mission to become the first American to orbit the earth.\n\nIt was that story and meeting Mr Zempilas that persuaded Murphy to donate one of his spacemen to Perth after the pair were introduced by gallery owner Paul Gullotti.\n\nBrendan Murphy is the artist and creator of Perth's Boonji Spaceman. (ABC News: Phoebe Pin)\n\n\"I'm not in the business of giving my work away. I'm one of the top-selling artists in the world,\" Murphy told Mark Gibson on ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\"[Mr Zempilas and I] had a couple of great chats and Zoom calls, and Basil was really inspired by my work.\n\n\"When that happens that means a lot to me, and this history of John Glenn identifying Perth as the city of lights, that really connected the dots for me.\"\n\nThe kebab out, Spaceman in\n\nWhen the council voted to accept the donation last year Mr Zempilas said it was \"an incredible opportunity\" to bring a real tourist attraction that fit Perth's story to the city.\n\nBut not everyone was pleased with the idea, particularly as the site allocated was previously occupied by another popular piece of public art \u2014 the Ore Obelisk, affectionately dubbed \"the kebab\".\n\nThe 15-metre-tall sculpture was designed by City of Perth town planner Paul Ritter and erected to celebrate Western Australia's population reaching 1 million in 1971.\n\nThe Ore Obelisk, pictured in December 1980, once sat in Stirling Gardens. (Supplied: State Library of Western Australia)\n\nFeaturing different geological specimens of rock, it symbolised the expansion of mining in the state in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe sculpture was dismantled and placed in storage in 2021 following \"engineering reports that it was unsafe and posed a risk to public safety\", a spokesperson for the council said.\n\nHelen Curtis, who runs a public art consultancy, launched the \"Save the Kebab\" campaign to restore and bring back the Ore Obelisk.\n\nShe was annoyed to find the council had allocated funds to the Boonji Spaceman.\n\nNow that the spaceman is in place she is continuing her campaign to reinstate the the kebab.\n\n\"We don't really love what he's bringing, and it's not just me,\" Ms Curtis said.\n\n\"There is a huge groundswell of people from the arts, design, the history professions.\n\n\"But also the broader Perth community and even people who worked in parks and gardens at the City of Perth are showing support for the campaign.\"\n\nThe Ore Obelisk was removed in 2021 due to structural safety concerns. (Facebook: City of Perth)\n\nSpaceman 'not local'\n\nMs Curtis said the Boonji Spaceman was not unique to Perth, as Murphy had already installed versions of the sculpture in London, Oslo, Dubai and Antigua.\n\nThe Perth version of the Boonji Spaceman is called Lightning.\n\n\"This is not about parochialism at all,\" Ms Curtis said.\n\n\"If the City of Perth is into Instagrammable tourism attractions then we can do that here ourselves.\n\n\"Let's look after what we have first, right? That should be our priority. The Ore Obelisk \u2014 why didn't the City of Perth look after that?\n\n\" These are really important parts of our heritage. They're our own Perth story. \"\n\nShe said if the city wanted tourist attractions it should commission local artists to create original work.\n\nA 'forward moving' sculpture\n\nThe unveiling of the Boonji Spaceman sculpture at Stirling Gardens. (ABC News: Phoebe Pin)\n\nMurphy said he was surprised to learn that his spaceman had caused controversy.\n\n\"I had no idea any of this existed until recently,\" he said.\n\nThe artist rejected claims his work was not connected with the story of Perth and was simply a copy of work he had created elsewhere.\n\n\"First of all I'm not an American artist. I'm an artist, and my role \u2026 is to bring people together and to try and create works that inspire people,\" he said.\n\n\"Having put [the Boonji Spaceman] in other cities around the world I know the effect it has.\n\n\"I've seen it bring people together and \u2026 in most cases, I think people will be proud because it's a very forward-looking, forward-moving sculpture. It's very contemporary.\"\n\nBasil Zempilas attended the Boonji Spaceman unveiling. (ABC News: Phoebe Pin)\n\nMurphy said the words written on the sculpture had been personalised for Perth, based on conversations with locals and research on the city's history.\n\nThe words \"ambition\" and \"City of Light\" appear on the spaceman's chest.\n\n\"I'm hopeful and pretty confident that everyone will come together once they experience the sculpture and I think they'll be proud of it,\" Murphy said.\n\nCity of Perth said the Boonji Spaceman would remain in its Stirling Gardens location for a year before being moved to another, as yet unnamed, location in the city.\n\nIt did not say how much it would cost to restore the Ore Obelisk but said it required significant work, including replacing all the conglomerate rock elements.",

    "text": "Celebrity sightings at the Chelsea Flower Show are a dime a dozen.\n\nThe prestigious annual garden extravaganza \u2014 widely considered the world's most famous \u2014 draws a stream of A-listers to west London.\n\nIf you looked up from the colourful exhibits this year, you might even have caught a glimpse of King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who are annual attendees.\n\nDavid Beckham, Joanna Lumley and Piers Morgan were also among those sashaying between the blooms.\n\nBut spotting the Australian Great Sun Orchid. Well, that's much rarer.\n\nBritish actor Joanna Lumley strikes a pose at the show on Monday. (Reuters: Toby Melville)\n\nIt was the first time the purple flower has ever been displayed at the show, and that's for a good reason.\n\nThe orchid grows naturally only in specific parts of southern Australia, where it flowers between September and December.\n\nBut at Chelsea this year, it bloomed months out of season, thousands of kilometres from its natural habitat, in a completely different climate.\n\nThe incredible feat saw judges from Britain's Royal Horticultural Society \u2014 the centuries old charity behind the show \u2014 reward it with a gold medal.\n\n\"It's like winning the plant Olympics,\" said Kinglsey Dixon, the West Australian botanist who masterminded the Great Sun Orchid's appearance.\n\n\"The gold is beyond the icing of the cake. It is the cake.\"\n\nBut it almost didn't happen.\n\nThe Great Sun Orchids brought a slice of Australia to the Chelsea Flower Show. (Supplied: Reece Morgan-Tolworthy)\n\nThe Australian flower was part of a wider exhibit which also showcased orchids from South-East Asia and the Pacific.\n\nAssisted by the elite team at Kew Royal Botanic Gardens and other collaborators around the world, each display featured orchids as they would look in their natural habitat.\n\nThe Great Sun Orchid was planted in sandy soil amongst granite rocks and blackened sticks, taken from Professor Dixon's own Western Australian property after a recent bushfire.\n\nIt was in stark contrast to the tropical displays around it, and that was exactly what Professor Dixon intended.\n\n\"It's us. It's Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a country of extremes and amongst all this, orchids are growing.\"\n\nQueen Camilla was among those inspecting the orchids at the show. (Supplied: Reece Morgan-Tolworthy)\n\nKew's orchid team pitched the idea of bringing the rare flower to Chelsea eight months ago.\n\n\"I said, 'Yeah, but we need years,'\" Professor Dixon said.\n\nWith transporting the plant from Australia and getting it to flower logistically impossible in that time frame, the team called on a colleague in Germany for help.\n\n\"I knew he had material that he's been growing for about 40 years from seed \u2026 I begged him, and he agreed,\" Professor Dixon said.\n\nWith the centrepiece secured, every other aspect was planned with the utmost precision, in the pursuit of winning gold.\n\nThe show's judging is notoriously strict.\n\nIt dates to 1913 and draws the world's most prominent gardeners to the smart streets of West London, not to mention celebrities and the British aristocracy.\n\nAustralia's Great Sun Orchid flowers only between September and December. (fickr: Corymb34 from Australia)\n\nStandards are eye-wateringly high, eclipsed perhaps only by the cost of an entry ticket, which can cost over 130 pounds ($270).\n\n\"We had some intel from previous years one display was disqualified because the font size was not quite the correct accredited size,\" Professor Dixon said.\n\n\"So we just were literally going around with tweezers, pulling off sand, pulling off grass and making sure the rocks are perfect.\"\n\nTheir hard work not only won gold, but the admiration of Camilla and Charles, who grow orchids in their Wildflower meadow at the king's country estate, Highgrove.\n\nCharles has supported the species' conservation for many years.\n\nThe exhibition organisers hope the win at Chelsea can attract more support to protect them, as the species faces growing threats in every corner of the globe.\n\nProfessor Kingsley Dixon was all smiles in London after claiming a gold medal. (ABC News: Adrian Wilson)\n\nOrchids 'particularly sensitive'\n\nThere are more than 30,000 species of orchids globally. They grow on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nBut their future is far from guaranteed.\n\n\"If you have degradation of land, fires out of season, other types of disruptions due to climate change, for example, then many plants and animals are then disrupted by those,\" said Mike Fay, the senior research leader in conservation genetics at Kew.\n\n\"The orchids are particularly sensitive.\"\n\nProfessor Fay explained the complex interactions orchids had with the environment meant they act as early warning systems for looming issues.\n\n\"If the orchid starts doing badly, then it's a sign that there's something major going wrong \u2026 they are the canary in the coal mine,\" Professor Fay said.\n\nScientists believe up to 60 per cent of orchids face possible extinction, and they're considered the most threatened plant group in Australia.\n\n\"It is important that every effort is made to arrest this decline for future generations to experience our incredible diversity,\" said Australian Orchid Foundation (AOF) co-chair Helen Richards.\n\n\"The AOF is delighted with the success that Kingsley has had with his display at Chelsea as it focuses local and international attention on the plight of Australia's orchid populations and the attempts being made to preserve our orchid heritage.\"\n\nThat sentiment is shared by the gold medal winners.\n\n\"It's not a message of despair but it's a message of a call to arms,\" Professor Dixon said.\n\n\"We can do it, and we can change it from bad news to a good news story very quickly.\"",

    "text": "Determined not to let back-to-back disasters crush their celebration, Australia's wettest town is preparing for its 100th sugarcane harvest.\n\nA sour start to 2025 threatened to overshadow the sweet milestone for Tully in Far North Queensland after successive tropical lows brought months of flooding rain during the peak growing season.\n\nDespite a significant reduction in the size of the crop, the growers say they are hopeful there's another 100 years ahead for the Tully Sugar Mill.\n\nOvercoming the odds\n\nOver the past two weeks multiple events have been held to mark the occasion, including the development of a historical site and mural.\n\nA mural has been established near the mill to mark the event. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nTully Sugar chief executive Andrew Yu said it was a special time for the town and the industry.\n\n\"This is not only a celebration of Tully Sugar it's really a celebration of the town, of the community, because basically Tully was built around the sugar mill,\" he said.\n\n\"The theme of the celebration is called 'growing together for 100 years'. That's very true because without the community support, without the growers, there wouldn't be a mill.\"\n\nAndrew Yu says the town was built around its sugar mill. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nHe said every time he heard the factory noise or saw the smoke coming out of the stack it made him excited.\n\nFor canegrowers like Anthony Silvestro and Hardeep Singh this season is extra special.\n\nEven though both are expecting lower yields on their farms south of Tully due to the floods, their spirits remained high.\n\n\"It's a good legacy what the mill has done for the district and the growers. It's been good to see that it's kept our community going,\" Mr Silvestro said.\n\n\" It's good to be a part of it, good to be connected to a mill that's lasted the century and hopefully it's got a few more centuries in it. \"\n\nSugarcane growers hope the industry will continue to thrive for centuries to come. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nCane growing is an industry used to overcoming extreme weather, like Tropical Cyclone Larry in 2006 and Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011.\n\nIn 1925, Tully received more than 3,600 millimetres of rain. In 2025 it reached that figure in the first five months.\n\nThat is just 100mm shy of the total for the same period in 1950, the wettest year on record, with 7,898mm.\n\nIt is the reason the town's famous Golden Gumboot is 7.9 metres tall.\n\nThe sugar mill in Tully has been crushing cane for a century. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nEven so, Mr Singh feels confident there are good years to come.\n\n\"I can see the mill going for 100 more years with the next generation and yeah, it's great to be a part of a good community,\" he said.\n\nBuilding on early success\n\nSugarcane has been grown in Tully since 1865, but it was not until November 1925 the town got its own mill.\n\nThe mill was built between 1924 and 1925. (Supplied: Greg Shannon)\n\nIt quickly became successful \u2014 by 1927 it was the first Australia sugar mill to crush more than 200,000 tonnes in a season.\n\nBy 1931 the Tully Co-Operative Sugar Million Association Limited was formed and local canegrowers bought the mill off the government.\n\nIt remained a grower-owned co-operative until 1990 when it became a public company known as Tully Sugar Limited.\n\nIn 2011 Chinese agribusiness company COFCO took over the mill which this year expects to crush at least 2.3 million tonnes of cane.\n\nTerry Grandshaw and Danielle Skocaj work together at SRA. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nThe celebration is about more than looking back.\n\nFor Danielle Skocaj, who joined the industry 20 years ago, it was also about the future.\n\nNow principal researcher for Sugar Research Australia (SRA), she said when she first started there were only two or three female extension officers employed by the company.\n\n\"Whereas now you look at a lot of our advisory staff \u2014 not just in SRA but other industry organisations \u2014 its researchers, technicians [have] got to be at least 50-50, if not more a female than male ratio,\" she said.\n\n\" I think women have a very bright future in the industry. I guess we're able to look at things from a different perspective. \"\n\nThe Tully sugar industry has been growing since 1925. (Supplied: Greg Shannon via Brice Henry)\n\nSRA Burdekin district manager Terry Grandshaw said both the people and the technology had come a long way since cutting cane by hand.\n\n\"We've got to remember our fathers and grandfathers, they made real step change in the industry,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's really important to understand we went from hand harvesting to mechanical harvesting, to trash blanket, to green cane harvesting.\"\n\nMs Skocaj is thrilled to see the mill continue to thrive today.\n\n\"The mill is the centre of our town,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a large industry, employs a lot of people, and to have withstood the last 100 years for all the different challenges is something definitely worth celebrating.\"",

(Supplied: DPHI Major Projects Portal)\n\n\"[This] has been informed by the completion of these technical studies and consultation with the government's State Design Review Panel,\" the company said.\n\n\"The crematorium remains part of the proposal for a later stage [of the development], and there will be dedicated consultation for this and all later stages of the project.\"\n\nThe revised concept plan, yet to be made public, is the third time the developer has changed the cemetery's size despite calls from Wollondilly Shire Council and the community to relocate or scrap the project.\n\n\"The amendments make no difference,\" said Tracey McConchie, who lives metres from the site.\n\nSandstone burials in bushfire zone\n\nBuilding Douglas Park Memorial Park, on a nearly 17,000 square-metre irregular block owned by Benima Pty Ltd, was first earmarked seven years ago.\n\nBut dozens of residents like Ms McConchie said it was the wrong site for the multi-million-dollar development.\n\n\"[The site] is basically a sandstone rock shelf. [The developer] would have to use a rock whipping process to basically manufacture soil to a depth to bury bodies,\" Ms McConchie said.\n\nTracey McConchie (centre) is among dozens of residents fighting the proposed cemetery since 2018. (ABC Illawarra: Brooke Chandler)\n\n\" There's no public transport to the site. It's in a bushfire zone, there's no sewerage, there's no gas line. It basically fails every criteria devised. \"\n\nFive years ago, despite strong opposition from the community and council, Wollondilly's Local Planning Panel approved the first blueprint for Douglas Park Memorial Park at 27,784 burial plots.\n\nThat capacity was almost tripled by the developer last year, alongside plans to offer funeral services daily using a crematorium and chapel.\n\nResidents staged a funeral procession in 2020 to demonstrate how the cemetery would clog roads. (Supplied: Paul Grierson)\n\nIn its 2024 scoping report the developer said increasing the number of burial plots \"responds to the need for cemeteries in NSW\" as evidenced in the 11th Hour report which found public cemeteries in Sydney would close to new burials in a decade.\n\n\"But we are on the outskirts of the [Sydney] region \u2026 and Wollondilly Shire itself is well supplied into the future, even with increases in the population,\" Ms McConchie said.\n\nShe also said a crematorium close to people's homes was \"inappropriate\" and raised health concerns.\n\nTo access the cemetery, cars would have to use either the Hume Highway or a windy, one-way route over the Nepean River known as The Gorge which Deputy Mayor Matthew Deeth said \"doesn't make sense\".\n\nMatthew Deeth says Wollondilly Shire Council will back the community's ongoing opposition to the cemetery. (ABC Illawarra: Kelly Fuller)\n\n\"We're not seeing the local infrastructure plans for the road networks being ready in time to not only take this type of development, but also the surrounding development of Wilton and Appin,\" Cr Deeth said.\n\nHe said if the DPHI approved the cemetery the road network would reach a \"failure point\".\n\nResidents ill, move away\n\nWhen Paul Grierson learnt the Douglas Park cemetery would be assessed as an SSD he sold his \"dream home\" and moved to nearby Picton.\n\n\"I just didn't have another two years of fighting in me,\" Mr Grierson said.\n\n\"I don't want to live with a cemetery, and it's going to happen at some level.\"\n\nPaul Grierson and his wife no longer live at Douglas Park due to the proposed cemetery. (ABC Illawarra: Brooke Chandler)\n\nHe is one of about four households who no longer live near Douglas Park Drive, partly because of the proposal.\n\nMs McConchie said \"it's a very unfair [and] sad outcome\" for the community.\n\n\"Some people have been made very ill trying to deal with this,\" she said.\n\nWollondilly Shire Council is currently reviewing whether developments like cemeteries should be built on rural land in the future.\n\nIf any amendments are made to the Local Environmental Plan (LEP), like prohibiting cemeteries in rural zones, the council told the ABC it would only affect development applications lodged after the change is made.\n\nHT Building Pty Ltd said the amended concept plan would be available for public comment in the coming months.",

    "text": "A dam in north-east Tasmania has \"significant structural concerns\" and should be decommissioned, a report has found.\n\nNeighbouring the small township of Pioneer, the Pioneer Dam is believed to have been built nearly a century ago by the Endurance Tin Mining Company, with \"limited records of its construction\".\n\nA report released in April, commissioned by the Department of Natural Resources and Environment, found the structural condition of the disused dam was \"critically compromised\".\n\nIt said recent severe weather events had caused trees to fall and create holes in the dam wall, and \"unauthorised modifications\" including the removal of culvert pipes had further compromised the dam's structural integrity.\n\nThe report found the dam had \"indicators of imminent instability\". (Flussig)\n\nFurthermore, it said the top of the dam wall had been used as \"unauthorised access to an adjacent campground\".\n\nThe report recommended the water levels be lowered immediately, and the dam decommissioned, given \"indicators of imminent instability\".\n\n\"The most risk averse and responsible course of action is to implement an immediate reservoir drawdown, followed by a staged decommissioning plan, unless a clear operational need justifies comprehensive rehabilitation works,\" Max Moller, of Hobart-based Flussig Engineers, stated in the report.\n\nModelling of a piping failure shows the extent of a potential breach. (Flussig)\n\nThe Parks and Wildlife Service (PWS) said in the short term, it had decided to lower the water level once it receives engineering advice \u2014 expected in early July \u2014 advising it how to do so.\n\n\"A final decision on the long-term management of Pioneer Dam will be made following the next stage of planning, advice and completion of works to lower the dam level,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nPWS closed the dam and nearby Pioneer Lake, which is popular for camping and fishing, following a site visit by the engineering company in December.\n\nCommunity calls for safety measures\n\nAlana Keygan at Pioneer Lake in north-east Tasmania. (Supplied: Alana Kegan)\n\nAlana Keygan lives in Pioneer with her family.\n\n\"I used to go kayaking on the lake on a daily basis, take the kids down there. It's just a really beautiful spot to be,\" she said.\n\n\"It's completely silent, you can hear the birds chirping and you're just surrounded by so much nature and beauty.\"\n\nBut she hasn't been since it was closed to the public, and is concerned about a potential dam breach.\n\n\"It seems to be quite an urgent thing that needs to be addressed,\" she said.\n\nThe Dorset council is facilitating a community meeting between PWS and residents on Monday to discuss the situation.\n\nA breach could inundate nearby roads with floodwaters reaching depths of 2.3\u20133 metres within an hour, the report found. (Flussig)\n\nDorset Mayor Rhys Beattie said Flussig Engineers would deliver a briefing on their findings.\n\n\"Parks and Wildlife are taking the required steps to assure safety,\" she said.\n\nMs Keygan will be attending and advocating for an emergency plan in the event of a breach, and the installation of floodwater warning signs for the roads.\n\n\"And what systems are in place for the community to get the word out quickly to each other?\" she said.\n\nIt's something another Pioneer local, Jenny Bellinger, would also like to see.\n\n\"I'm quite concerned on the safety aspect,\" she said.\n\n\"The kids in the town swim in the river because they couldn't go to the lake this year.\n\n\"Are kids going to notice that the water is rising quickly? I don't know.\n\n\"We need probably a siren there to let everyone know if the dam wall does break.\"\n\nModelling shows flood could cut access routes\n\nAs part of the report, the engineers undertook modelling to see what would happen if the dam wall breached.\n\nFlood mapping withheld from public Photo shows Flooding covers most of the town of Huonville Tasmania's hydroelectric operator says it did not want to \"create unnecessary concern\" for residents of a small town by releasing flood mapping, done in 2016, which shows what could happen should a rare earthquake event cause catastrophic failure of two dams.\n\nThe modelling assumed the weather on the day of the breach was fair, with no rain.\n\nWhile it predicted no residential or commercial buildings would be inundated, the floodwaters would likely cut off critical access routes and isolate communities.\n\nMs Bellinger wants more modelling done to see what would happen during rainy conditions.\n\n\"I think it needs to be updated to what would happen in a one-in-20-year event or a one-in-50-year event,\" she said.\n\nThe report said further assessments may be required to consider potential loss of life, given Pioneer Lake's use as a recreational camping and fishing site.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Anyone considering a trip to the US is confronted with a question: Is it safe to go? Headlines from the second administration of President Donald Trump convey scenes of disruption, confusion, corruption and shattered norms. Is it possible to enjoy a vacation in a country like this? There are 27,500 commercial flights travelling in US skies a day. Credit: Bloomberg You can imagine two circles of a Venn diagram: One represents the Trump-spurred disruption and sense of perma-crisis he brings. A second one represents basic aviation safety and having a good time. Surely, the two circles can\u2019t stay separate forever. If and when they overlap, will they overlap on your holiday to the US? The US suffered its most deadly air crash in years in January when an American Airlines Flight collided with a US Army Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia, killing 67 people. A preliminary investigation raised questions about congestion in the area and the air traffic control staffing. A perhaps more pressing example in the era of Trump: air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty airport near New York lost radar vision and radio contact with flights on April 28. Some controllers were so upset afterwards that they took trauma leave. After the scare, the chief executive of United, which uses Newark as a hub, cut back flights for safety. One contributing factor is that Newark is a temporarily closed runway, set to reopen in June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading But to give a sense of the challenge for the US more broadly, consider that there are 3800 commercial flights a day in Australia. In the US, that number is closer to 27,500, with air traffic controllers monitoring and directing 5000 flights simultaneously in peak periods. The Federal Aviation Administration has been trying to upgrade its network of staff and equipment for decades, while attracting more air traffic controllers. There are now 14,000 air traffic controllers in the US, nearly 2000 of them hired last year. However, that still leaves a shortfall of 3000. Trump has largely inherited this problem, though he previously had four years as president to address it. However, it\u2019s far from clear that Trump is inclined or capable of improving the situation for US air traffic control. Immediately after the January crash near Washington, Trump blamed \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d hires as contributing to the ability of air traffic controllers to function. In a statement at the time, Trump claimed that under former president Joe Biden the FAA \u201cspecifically recruited and hired individuals with \u2018severe intellectual\u2019 disabilities [and] psychiatric issues ...\u2019\u201d When Trump returned to office in January, he came with billionaire campaign funder Elon Musk in tow, pushing a radical government-slashing project called DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFAA air traffic controllers are themselves exempt from DOGE cuts and are being recruited. But at more senior levels, the Washington Post reports, in keeping with the DOGE purges, there has been an exodus of people. American air traffic control is ripe for reform. As the Brookings Institute notes: \u201cThe consensus of countless commissions and expert reports is that air traffic management is a 24/7 high-tech service \u2018business\u2019 trapped in a regulatory agency that is constrained by federal budget and acquisition rules.\u201d That is, the budget for its modernisation keeps getting eaten up by the cost of maintaining legacy systems. United chief executive Scott Kirby reassured reporters in New York on May 13: \u201cAt Newark, first and foremost, it is safe. It is absolutely safe when these issues happen. Our pilots are trained with back-up procedures to keep the airline safe, and so whether you lose communications or radar, we have back-up procedures.\u201d Donald Trump is all about disruption and retribution. But what does that do for aviation safety? Credit: AP To his credit, Kirby has not shied away from the issue. Kirby has publicly highlighted the jam United and the US aviation sector has been put in by the FAA, and by Trump. In April, as the world watched and waited for the next shoe to drop in Trump\u2019s tariff strategy, Kirby offered not one but two earnings estimates, depending on whether the US president\u2019s moves triggered a recession or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, in his first 100 days in office, has imposed hiring freezes across government, stripped federal employees of job protections and fundamentally downsized the US government while centralising White House power. The head of the US Department of Transportation, Sean Duffy \u2013 an ex-congressman, prosecutor and former reality TV star, natch \u2013 has announced a plan expected to cost tens of billions of dollars to fix the US air traffic control system within four years. Trump supports the plan. But the devil is in the delivery. And to be sure, many air traffic controller bodies around the world are in the process of rebuilding staff. Airservices Australia, for example, is recruiting and training controllers. \u201cWe expect controller numbers to be back to surplus capacity by mid-year,\u201d a company spokesman said. But in the US, the problem is longstanding and deep-seated. Now uncertainty abounds for Americans and visiting travellers alike. And it\u2019s not just the fear of accidents. It\u2019s also the waiting, the delays and the disruptions on the ground that mark so much travel in the US. As for Newark Liberty Airport, Kirby cut back flights in light of the safety scare and issued two messages exhorting regulators to take further actiondespite his insistence that it\u2019s safe. Not everyone agrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliam McGee, a senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project, told NPR he just didn\u2019t \u201csee the seriousness and the sense of purpose from this administration\u201d to address the FAA problems. The US has been grappling with air traffic control issues for years. Credit: AP Despite Kirby\u2019s commentary on the FAA and US aviation, he is supportive of Trump\u2019s aspirations to bring back well-paid jobs to the US, saying the goal is \u201claudable\u201d. He notes that United is \u201cone of the few companies left in the country that creates the kind of jobs where you can make a six-digit income, you can support a family, buy a house and [send] your kids to college, even if you only have a high school education\u201d. Kirby says he is taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump on the economy and tariffs. Speaking the day after Trump announced a reduction in tariffs with China, Kirby said: \u201cEveryone should kind of take a breath because we\u2019re not at the end game yet. We\u2019re not at the new normal yet\u201d. Whatever the outcome, United is betting big on the future. After being the only American airline to fly to Australia through COVID lockdown, United is piling on more capacity for flights to Australia. Already, from November to March, United says it was the largest carrier between the US and Australia as measured by available seat miles. While the majority of those flights were Americans visiting Australia, Australians travelling to the US are well represented.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Crucially, it had done so as its energy demand increased. This is what makes the data so remarkable. Over recent years, the world \u2013 and China in particular \u2013 has deployed renewable energy technology far faster than expected. This was always good news. The problem has always been that demand for electricity kept growing faster than the supply of new renewables, so while there was more clean energy in global systems, emissions kept growing. Myllyvirta\u2019s new analysis, first published in Carbon Brief earlier this month, shows that China has finally broken this terrible nexus: emissions in China are finally falling as its use of electricity grows.\n\n\u201cBeing able to cut emissions while power demand not just grew but grew above the historical average is certainly a historic milestone, showing the scale that clean energy additions have reached in China,\u201d Myllyvirta told this masthead on Tuesday. And what happens in China affects us all. Loading \u201cNeedless to say, if the fall in emissions is sustained, that constitutes a major breakthrough for the global energy transition and the global climate effort, as China has been responsible for all of the net increase in CO2 emissions since the Paris climate conference, so an emission peak in China would highly likely enable global emissions to peak and decline,\u201d Myllyvirta said. \u201cWhether the falling trend in China\u2019s emissions continues depends strongly on the clean energy targets in China\u2019s upcoming Paris climate commitments and five-year plan; if the current rate of clean energy additions is continued, it is very likely that it will.\u201d\n\nSo far, the indications for this are good, at least politically. Though China\u2019s \u201call of the above\u201d energy policy includes new coal plants as well as clean power, the clean is outweighing the dirty. Those new coal plants are not only displacing older ones, they are running under capacity. And China remains determined to achieve energy independence at pace \u2013 which means generating energy domestically to cut its dependence on imports of oil, gas and coal. Energy analyst Tim Buckley notes that China is acting in self-interest here. As it expands its regional hegemony, China is determined both to free itself of coal, oil and gas imported via potentially vulnerable shipping lanes, and to dominate the technologies of the future. It is also worth noting that the slight dip in emissions may be a signal of a plateau in emissions rather than an ongoing decline, Buckley says.\n\nLoading This means that even as the Trump administration goes about unpicking former president Joe Biden\u2019s subsidies for green energy deployment to support the American shale oil industry, China is pushing harder on new clean tech. A speech made by Chinese President Xi Jinping last month also caught the attention of climate analysts and diplomats. China must accelerate the transition to clean energy, he said. \u201cClear waters and green mountains are just as valuable as gold and silver. Green transformation is not only the essential way to address climate change, but also a new engine for economic and social development.\u201d\n\nStriking a determinedly different tone from the Trump administration, he added, \u201cWe must deepen international co-operation. Solidarity and co-operation are needed more than ever as the world faces multiple, compounded challenges. We should rise above estrangement and conflict with openness and inclusiveness.\u201d But the key news in a colourful speech was buried in some of its most drab language. Xi said that in coming months China would announce a new emissions reduction target for 2035 that would cover \u201call economic sectors and all greenhouse gases\u201d. This is significant because in the past China has committed to reducing greenhouse pollution only relating to electricity production. China will increase its climate ambition across its economy, even as it beats its own climate targets. This is a good sign for crucial global climate talks to be held in Brazil later this year, before which other nations, including Australia, are expected to announce strong new 2035 targets. \u201cWhat\u2019s already clear is that China\u2019s recipe for peaking and reducing emissions is a combination of rapid electrification \u2013 not just in transportation but also in industry and buildings \u2013 with very large-scale additions of clean energy,\u201d Myllyvirta says.",

    "text": "Treat a visit to Rowe Street like a pub crawl, and discover a cult soup spot, an epic mart with a \u201csauce corner\u201d, barbecue eateries, night markets, grocers and lots more.\n\nSave Log in , register or subscribe to save recipes for later. You have reached your maximum number of saved items. Remove items from your saved list to add more. Share\n\nEastwood\u2019s food claim to fame, historically at least, is the Granny Smith apple. First discovered growing on Maria Ann \u201cGranny\u201d Smith\u2019s property back in the 1860s, the apple is still celebrated with an annual festival. But since Eastwood\u2019s commercial centre was pedestrianised in the 1990s, the suburb has had plenty more to offer in the culinary stakes. The catalyst has been a rapid shift in demographic: as of 2021, more than 48 per cent of residents claim Chinese ancestry, while nearly 9 per cent have roots in Korea. Rowe Street takes those figures off the page and renders them in full colour, with the Koreatown Project, backed by government funding, accelerating the transformation of the street\u2019s east end from local hub to delicious destination, as vital for Korean cooking and culture as Strathfield or Lidcombe. Jimmy Park, the project\u2019s manager, has witnessed the change first-hand. \u201cWhen I came in 1988, there were only two Korean shops on Rowe Street,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, it\u2019s more than 120.\u201d Those range from hairdressers and boutiques, to the grocers and restaurants that give the street its distinctive flavour. Cross the station, and Korean turns to Chinese, with broad regional representation and plenty outside the lines. Justin Li, a Ryde councillor who recommends treating a visit to Rowe Street a little like a pub crawl, says it\u2019s the demise of a fast-food giant that best represents Eastwood\u2019s evolution. \u201cAn old Chinatown institution, Super Bowl, recently opened on Rowe Street West, ironically where Eastwood\u2019s McDonald\u2019s once stood. It says a lot about the changing demographics and tastes locally over the last few decades.\u201d The choice of side is your own, but such is the scope that whichever you pick first, odds are it won\u2019t be too long before you\u2019re back for more. Hwagae Banchan\u2019s specialty is the array of side dishes \u2013 banchan \u2013 that accompany a Korean meal. Jennifer Soo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHwagae Banchan Shop Exit the station to the east, and you\u2019ll find a clutch of stalls specialising in Korean street food, including tteokbokki, the spicy rice cakes, and flash-fried Korean-style hot dogs. Stop at Hwagae Banchan Shop, though, and the specialty is the array of side dishes \u2013 banchan \u2013 that accompany a Korean meal. Classics include cabbage or spring onion kimchi tinted red with gochugaru, Korean chilli powder, or braised lotus root. Stock up, then grab some kimbap, Korea\u2019s answer to a sushi roll, to takeaway. 10 Railway Parade, Eastwood Rice cakes, or tteok, are the main draw at Siroo. Jennifer Soo Siroo Rice Cake Cafe Make for Rowe Street, perhaps drop into ginseng specialist Cheong Kwan Jang, then join the line at Siroo. With South Koreans now drinking 353 cups of coffee per head a year \u2013 more than double the global average \u2013 the nation\u2019s cafe culture is ever-expanding. That partly explains Siroo\u2019s popularity, but it\u2019s the rice cakes, or tteok, that are the main draw. Made each morning by owner Changhyun Lee, Siroo\u2019s tteok are characteristically chewy, with the injeolmi \u2013 made with sticky rice and finished with roasted soybean powder \u2013 a signature. Buy a pack, or try it in the cafe\u2019s viral shaved-ice dessert, bingsu. 106 Rowe Street, Eastwood, sirooricecakecafe.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiryang Gukbap soup shop channels South Korea\u2019s south-east. Jennifer Soo Miryang Just a couple of doors up from celebrated Korean-Chinese restaurant Biwon (try the jajangmyeon) is Miryang, a freshly opened soup restaurant channelling South Korea\u2019s south-east. The menu may be short, but the flavours are long and deep in everything from wagyu shank soup and gukbap with sundae \u2013 the Korean blood sausage \u2013 to the signature, light and aromatic Miryang-style pork soup loaded with spring onions. Season yours with salted shrimp and load up on fluffy rice \u2013 refills come free. 104 Rowe Street, Eastwood, instagram.com/miryang_eastwood The sauce section at Eastwood Mart. Jennifer Soo Eastwood Mart There\u2019s no shortage of grocers on this side of Eastwood station: S-Mart is an all-rounder, while KMALL09 (also in Lidcombe) stands out for its epic size, heaving shelves and range of K-beauty products. But Eastwood Mart, smack-bang on Rowe Street, is a classic. Big enough to have the range, small enough to feel personal, it\u2019s the place for bulk kimchi, noodles, seaweed and fresh vegetables. Don\u2019t leave without taking a turn around the \u201csauce corner\u201d or grabbing some mandu from the staff helming the hotplate out front.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n73 Rowe Street, Eastwood Getbawi specialises in hoe, or raw seafood. Jennifer Soo GetBawi Up the hill from K-bakery La Vigne and tucked into a shopping mall, newcomer GetBawi has quickly garnered a dedicated following. The reason? It\u2019s one of the few Sydney restaurants specialising in hoe, or raw seafood, served here on platters with the likes of perilla leaves for wrapping. Other highlights include spicy blue swimmer crab hotpot and the textural masterpiece that is yukhoe tang tang, featuring high-grade raw beef strewn with umami-rich octopus. 201/62-80 Rowe Street, Eastwood, instagram.com/getbawi Split a bowl of gamjatang soup with friends at Guk\u2019s Eedaero Gamjatang. James Brickwood Guk\u2019s Eedaero Gamjatang\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, family-run Pu Ji Mi sold mountains of jok bal (soy-braised pork hocks) in this unassuming mall. Its closure in February was mourned far and wide, but the good news is that in its place Eastwood now has its own outpost of Guk\u2019s Eedaero Gamjatang, Jongguk Lee\u2019s cult soup kitchen. Split a gamjatang with friends, and it\u2019ll be rich from long-simmered pork bones and doenjang, spicy from gochugaru and gochujang and loaded with perilla, potatoes and enoki mushrooms. Add a round of ice-cold Cass lager to keep the vibes high. 202/62-80 Rowe Street, Eastwood Photo: Jennifer Soo Dae Jang Kum Crossing the road, Uncles\u2019 Butchery, is a chance to score Korean barbecue meats \u2013 Black Onyx chuck tail flap, say \u2013 but if you\u2019d prefer to grill here and now, a block up is Dae Jang Kum, where the charcoal burns hot, and the beef intercostal in soy and sesame is the order.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Latrell Mitchell\u2019s former coach Jason Demetriou says it as well as anybody. \u201cWhen Latrell speaks the narrative doesn\u2019t always go the direction he wants. The narrative can go anywhere because he\u2019s either loved or he\u2019s not liked.\u201d For nine months and counting, the NRL\u2019s most intriguing figure has kept his counsel and kept the quotes to himself. Yet Mitchell is still rugby league\u2019s biggest star and accordingly, the man rugby league media flocks to most. Even when he won\u2019t talk. Shots of him playing golf in the rain and his Instagram account - endorsing South Sydney\u2019s social media campaign to ditch Accor Stadium for Allianz - have counted as Latrell news this week from NSW Origin camp. Along with updates that Latrell still ain\u2019t talking. And conjecture about whether he should be. It hasn\u2019t always been this way. More just Mitchell\u2019s latest wrestle in his complicated relationship with the fourth estate, not to mention his place in the rugby league ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatrell Mitchell: the man everyone wants a piece of. Credit: Michael Howard Now in his tenth season of first-grade, Mitchell has occupied rare air for years as far as newsworthiness goes. No-one in rugby league compares. For what he does on the field that no-one else can. And what he says off the field that no-one else will. Since the internet came into being, only Jarryd Hayne has broken it like Mitchell in this game. Though you suspect Andrew Johns would have rivalled them if his career - mercifully for the Eighth Immortal - hadn\u2019t just missed the rise of social media. Loading Brisbane\u2019s enigmatic Reece Walsh might still match Mitchell some day, though more headlines are the last thing he or the Broncos need. Nick Kyrgios is probably the only Australian athlete who trumps South Sydney\u2019s superstar in turning the heads of Sydney-based editors and TV producers chasing clicks, comments and views.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitchell\u2019s lasting impact on his Indigenous people will always, rightly, leave all that in the shade. I still recall standing in the SCG sheds in 2019, when he was just 22 and still a Rooster, as he addressed the torrent of racial abuse he was receiving on social media for the first time. I asked Mitchell if he truly grasped the pile-on coming his way. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Everything that is said about Aboriginal people really affects me,\u201d was his simple, lasting reply. On Indigenous issues and representation, no voice has rung louder or longer than Mitchell\u2019s in Australian sport since. Latrell Mitchell before an Indigenous All Stars game. Credit: NRL Photos For a while afterwards, Mitchell revelled in the lighter side of breaking the world wide web too. When the Rabbitohs flew him to Philadelphia to work with reconditioning guru Bill Knowles in 2022, Mitchell returned with his hamstrings in order and a new outlook on his rugby league life. \u201cI\u2019ve been having fun, that\u2019s always been me, I\u2019ve just been perceived as someone else,\u201d Mitchell told colleague Christian Nicolussi during a mid-season South Sydney media day, conducting no less than a dozen interviews in the Redfern Oval stands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it all my life, I\u2019ve talked a big game but always backed it up. \u201cI think a lot more players need to be outspoken and confident in themselves, and understand the power you have in this game\u2026 In the US they are funny, and I took a lot out of the way they talk. \u201cThey know the power they have. We need to start understanding that.\u201d Good times for all. Because Mitchell did back himself up with big game after big game in a career-best run. And delivered a slew of headline-worthy quotes to boot. He declared \u201cthat NSW jersey is mine\u201d after terrorising incumbent Blues centre Matt Burton one Friday night, laughed off accusations of lying down to draw a penalty with \u201ccall me Trell Milk\u201d and \u201cused [the media] to my advantage and the Roosters took the bait\u201d when tensions were at their highest against his former club and Mitchell was being booed relentlessly. Box office: Latrell Mitchell roars to the crowd after nailing a sideline conversion against the Roosters in 2022. Credit: Getty Two years on, Mitchell understands the power he also wields in not speaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the most tumultuous period of his career, when he briefly considered walking away from the game and Souths pondered similarly uncomfortable questions about his future at the club, Mitchell needed Wayne Bennett like never before. Forget the side-mouth, single word answers and cranky old Wayne routine. The 75-year-old uses the media to his advantage better than anyone. Bennett\u2019s return to the Rabbitohs coincided with Mitchell needing to put his head down. Needing to repay the club for a hellish campaign that ended with a foot injury, one-game ban and $40,000 in NRL and South Sydney fines (with a further $80,000 fine suspended) for the photos of him standing over a white substance in a Dubbo hotel room. The Mitchell narrative of last year - which also included his involvement in the Spencer Leniu-Ezra Mam racism saga, an expletive-laden Triple M interview and suspension for belting Shaun Johnson - was wilder than ever as it grew untenable. Wayne Bennett returned to South Sydney when Latrell Mitchell needed him most. Credit: Getty Nine months of no comment is Mitchell, with South Sydney\u2019s backing, taking charge of the narrative and letting \u201chis footy do the talking\u201d - one of his favourite refrains over the years. Nine months of no comment also leaves that potentially career-defining drama in Dubbo hanging in the air though. It remains the reference point for any reporter worth their salt because Mitchell has never addressed it himself.\n\nAdvertisement",

There are a number that are still missing as well, and that search continues. And our thoughts are for those communities out there that have been affected by this major and significant weather event. It's going to take some time. As we know, Australians and New South Wales people are resilient, we will get through this, and we will be there to support you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is travelling to flood-affected areas today.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal MPs have expressed broad support for reuniting with the Nationals, though concerns linger over the latter\u2019s policy demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth parties have delayed announcing their shadow cabinet line-ups as talks continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a virtual party room meeting last night, Liberal leader Sussan Ley said there was strong backing to remain in coalition, but not at any cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nationals are pushing for commitments to nuclear energy, divestiture laws, a regional investment fund, and improved phone coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Liberal source says that none of the proposals were deal breakers, but M-Ps remain cautious about unclear costings and the risk of signing what they call, a blank cheque.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael has allowed limited aid into Gaza for the first time in weeks, but shortages remain severe.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian officials say just 100 trucks carrying food and medical supplies entered on Wednesday local time, far below what's needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome southern bakeries have reopened using U-N-supplied flour, but many trucks remain stuck at the border.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent fears crowds may loot incoming aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu says a new distribution zone will soon allow U-S companies to deliver food safely in military-controlled areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, we intend to have large safe zones in the south of Gaza. The Palestinian population will move there for their own safety, while we conduct combat in other zones, and receive humanitarian aid there without Hamas interference. In the meantime, we authorised letting trucks enter Gaza to provide for immediate needs. Yesterday, I think 100, more than 100 trucks went in. More will come in today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael imposed the blockade in March, accusing Hamas of diverting aid, claims Hamas denies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN says a quarter of Gaza\u2019s population faces famine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to health officials, at least 29 people, including children, have died from starvation in recent days.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials are working to understand how the ban on international student enrolments at Harvard University will impact Australians studying there.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration revoked the university's ability to enrol international students and is forcing existing students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal status.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd posted on X [[former Twitter]] that the Embassy is working to obtain further details from the U-S government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are monitoring closely developments at Harvard University in relation to the administration\u2019s statement this afternoon on the future enrolment of international students. I know this will be distressing for Harvard\u2019s many Australian students. The Embassy is working with the United States Government to obtain the details of this decision so that Australian students can receive appropriate advice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Rudd adds that he intends to engage with the U-S administration on the impact this decision will have on Australian students and their families both at Harvard and at other campuses across the United States.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a University of Queensland study, Australians are swearing less online than expected, ranking below the U-S and UK in global profanity use.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers analysed over 1.7 billion words from online content across 20 English-speaking countries, tracking 597 vulgar words using computational linguistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Australia\u2019s reputation for colourful language, lead researcher Martin Schweinberger suggests Aussies may reserve swearing for in-person conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe notes many might find the findings surprising, as profanity and slang are often embraced as part of Australian culture, even in tourism slogans like \u201cso where the bloody hell are you?\u201d asked by model Lara Bingle.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nTo tennis, and Alex de Minaur faces a challenging first week at the French Open, with a potential quarter-final clash against rival Jannik Sinner looming, if he can get that far.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe draw has offered little relief for Australia\u2019s 15-strong contingent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the women\u2019s bracket, Maya Joint and Ajla Tomljanovic will meet in a first-round clash dubbed a 'battle of the generations'.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes just days after the two face off in the Morocco Open semi-final on Friday, Joint's first W-T-A semi-final and Tomljanovic\u2019s 10th French Open campaign.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Flour and other food aid will start reaching some of Gaza's most vulnerable people after Israel let some humanitarian aid trucks through, but nowhere near enough to make up for shortages caused by an 11-week blockade, Palestinian officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael said it allowed 100 trucks also carrying baby food and medical equipment into the enclave on Wednesday, two days after announcing its first relaxation of the restrictions under mounting international pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael imposed the blockade on all supplies in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters \u2014 a charge the group denies\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations said a quarter of Gaza's 2.3 million people were at risk of famine.\n\n\n\nTrucks carrying aid have begun entering Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing. Source: Getty / Amir Levy \"Some bakeries will begin receiving flour to produce bread, and we expect the distribution of bread to begin later today,\" Amjad al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network in Gaza, told the Reuters news agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said just 90 trucks had entered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"During the ceasefire, 600 trucks used to enter every day, which means that the current quantity is a drop in the ocean, nothing,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWorkers produce bread for distribution at the World Food Programme bakery after a limited amount of flour entered the Gaza Strip. Source: Getty / Anadolu Bakeries backed by the UN's World Food Programme would produce the bread and the agency's staff would hand it out \u2014 a more controlled system than previously when bakers sold it directly to the public at a low cost, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea is to try and reach the most needy families, those who are desperate, as it is just the start,\" Shawa said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian health minister Majed Abu Ramadan said on Thursday that 29 children had died from \"starvation-related deaths\" in Gaza in recent days and that many more were at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinians have been scrambling for basic supplies, with Israel's blockade leading to critical food and medicine shortages.\n\n\n\nUmm Talal al-Masri, 53, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, described the situation as \"unbearable\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No one is distributing anything to us. Everyone is waiting for aid, but we haven't received anything,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We barely manage to prepare one meal a day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUN agencies have said that the amount of aid entering Gaza falls far short of what is required to ease the crisis.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Global criticism of Israel mounts as its Gaza campaign continues\n\n\"I am tormented for my children,\" Hossam Abu Aida, another resident of the Gaza Strip, told AFP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For them, I fear hunger and disease more than I do Israeli bombardment,\" the 38-year-old added.\n\n\n\nIsrael orders evacuation of parts of northern Gaza\n\nThe Israeli army issued an evacuation warning on Thursday for 14 neighbourhoods of northern Gaza, as it pressed a renewed offensive that has drawn international condemnation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an Arabic-language statement on Thursday, the military said it was \"operating with intense force\" in 14 areas in the northern Gaza Strip, accusing \"terrorist organisations\" of operating there.\n\n\n\nIsraeli strikes have continued along the Gaza Strip. Source: AAP / Mohammed Saber/EPA Israeli military strikes on Gaza killed at least 52 Palestinians across the enclave on Thursday, Gaza's civil defence agency said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has repeatedly said it seeks to avoid civilian casualties and targets militants.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Beit Lahiya on the northern edge of the enclave, a tank shell hit a medicine warehouse inside Al-Awda Hospital and set it ablaze, the health ministry said.\n\n\n\nRescue workers had been trying to extinguish the fires for hours, it added.\n\n\n\n\n\nTanks are stationed outside the hospital, medics say, effectively blocking access to the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gaza healthcare system has been barely functioning, with most of the medical facilities out of order, because of repeated Israeli military strikes, raids and the ban on the entry of medical supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel would be open to a temporary ceasefire to enable the return of hostages taken by Hamas-led fighters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if they were not returned, he said it would press ahead with a military campaign to gain total control of Gaza.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Pope Leo calls on Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza\n\n\"Netanyahu continues to stall and insist on pursuing the war. There is no value to any agreement that doesn't stop the massacres in Gaza permanently,\" senior Hamas official Sami Ab Zuhri said in response to Netanyahu's comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas attack in October 2023, in which some 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's campaign has since killed more than 53,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, and devastated the coastal strip, where aid groups say signs of severe malnutrition are widespread.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Therapeutic Drug Administration has approved a new drug that could offer hope to those with Alzheimer's.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and affects around 600,000 Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers say the new medication represents a significant step on the path to better treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I think we're seeing with Alzheimer's what we saw with cancer research about 50 years ago; we no longer have drugs just for the symptoms, we have drugs that now target the underlying disease process in Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Michael Woodward is the Director of Aged Care Research and Memory Clinic at Austin Health.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the drug, Donanemab, works to remove the build-up of the protein called amyloid plaque, which is linked to memory loss and impaired thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this can slow the progression of Alzheimer's, Professor Woodward says the drug is no panacea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The drug is only effective, however, for people with mild Alzheimer's disease. That includes mild cognitive impairment and early dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. It's not suitable for people who are considerably affected by their Alzheimer's disease, people who need day to day care, people who can't look after their bathing, their dressing, or what have you. [With] that degree of severity, unfortunately, this drug will not be effective. It's only effective in people with the early symptoms such as significant memory loss and maybe a little loss of day to day independence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n67 year old Joel Fulton was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis wife Diane says the drug offers hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If this drug could do what it says and give us quality time, that would be just everything. It really would.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n77 year old Frank Freschi is being treated with a similar drug that targets the amyloid plaque.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's part of a clinical trial that started three years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My view is if I can help and I can get some benefit perhaps at the end, even if it's only a year of slowing down that decline, that's worth doing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDonanemab can have some major side effects including brain swelling and bleeding.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say symptomatic side effects are fairly rare though.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Christopher Rowe is the Director of the Australian Dementia Network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They occur in about two per cent of patients getting this drug, but that is because they're watched very carefully, with MRI scans - you have to have about five in the first six months - and if you see early signs of the development of swelling in the brain or a little bit of bleeding in the brain, you need to stop the drug for a while.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDonanemab isn't cheap either.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and costs around $4,700 a month, with treatment lasting 12 to 18 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a possibility that could change after a review process in July, but Professor Rowe says listing the drug could lead to a large jump in demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is going to be a bit of a shock for the health system. There's already fairly long waiting times to see a memory specialist, and we expect this to really lead to a surge in demand for those services that are already overstretched.\"\n\n\n\n",

And I thank her for that. And as a consequence, I have decided to send those spokespeople home as a sign of good faith, and Sussan, as a sign of good faith, will not be announcing Shadow Cabinet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four policy areas are: a 20 billion-dollar regional investment fund; divestiture powers over large supermarkets engaging in anti-competitive behaviour; a recommitment to nuclear energy; and an expansion of telecommunications universal service obligations for regional Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese has announced that M-Ps and Senators will return to Canberra for the 48th Parliament on July the 22nd.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than two weeks after their resounding election victory, Labor will return to parliament with at least 93 seats in the House of Representatives, up from 78 in its first term.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor could have as many as 94 seats, depending on the outcome in the Melbourne-based seat of Calwell, which is yet to be finalised.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission says Calwell has been the most complicated count in its history.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo men have died and others are missing as as intense rainfall and flooding continues over a large section of New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least three people are missing and tens of thousands of people remain isolated along the state's mid-north coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flooding has been caused by a low pressure system over the region that has dumped months of rain in just a few days.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvacuation orders have been issued to 34 areas and more than 48,000 people remain isolated.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales S-E-S Commissioner Mike Wassing is urging people to heed the warnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are very high risk operations. I will not compromise the safety of my people, or any other emergency services people. These are highly trained people, they are working very closely with the community. What the community can do to help us is to heed those warnings, relocate early and evacuate if it is safe to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nA mother and her two children have suffered critical burns after a gas cylinder explosion caused a fire at their home in Melbourne's south-east.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fire is being treated as suspicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 30 firefighters arrived at the townhouse in Chadstone last night [[21/05]] to find flames burning through the roof of the two-story home.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 37-year-old woman and two primary school aged children were found unconscious inside; they're all in a critical condition in hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nA neighbour says smoke billowed kilometres up into the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Israeli embassy staff have been shot and killed while attending an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington D-C.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mayor of D-C, Muriel Bowser, says there is no active threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing his arrest, police say the suspect yelled 'Free Palestine'.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Pamela Smith from the D-C Police Department says the suspect has been apprehended and has indicated that he is responsible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect, who is now in custody. Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum. He approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire, striking both of our decedents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations reports around 90 trucks carrying aid have been dispatched into Gaza, but says they are just a drop in the ocean compared to how much aid is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt remains unclear how much, if any, of the aid being allowed into Gaza is reaching civilians, with the U-N and other humanitarian workers saying even once inside the enclave, Israeli officials are restricting their movements and activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U-N Office for the Corrdination of Humanitarian Affairs, says around 500 trucks need to enter Gaza daily in order to provide adequate food and supplies to the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Food Programme Director for the occupied Palestinian territories, Antoine Renard, says access must be granted to all aid convoys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we speak, there have been only 78 trucks that have been managed by the United Nations to enter into Gaza. All the different goods so far are just in Keren Shalom on the Gaza side. We have not been able to pick them up because we are still facing challenges related to the routing to access Gaza.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New Zealand government has brought down a budget with a deficit of 14.7 billion dollars- despite making more than five billion dollars in savings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's no easy path back to surplus, either, with the forward estimates forecasting deficits in each of the next four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance Minister Nicola Willis is emphasising growth in this budget, with the centrepiece being a business tax break worth more than 1.5 billion dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition Labour party has attacked the savings made, saying they are disproportionately coming from female-dominated industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nAnge Postecoglou says Tottenham's victory in the Europa League final can be a springboard for his future at the club.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 59-year-old Australian coach has made history, guiding Tottenham to the Europa League title, and thus a spot in the Champions League next season, with a one goal to nil over Manchester United in the Spanish city of Bilbao.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's Tottenham's first major title in 17 years, and first title in Europe in 41 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nPostecoglou has admitted he's prioritised the Europa League since the end of January.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe admits that's had a deleterious effort on his team in the English Premier League, where they are coming 17th.\n\n\n\n\n\nTottenham's fall in the Premier League has put extreme pressure on Postecoglou's job, but he says this victory proves his critics don't understand what he's doing.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Anyone considering a trip to the US is confronted with a question: Is it safe to go? Headlines from the second administration of President Donald Trump convey scenes of disruption, confusion, corruption and shattered norms. Is it possible to enjoy a vacation in a country like this? There are 27,500 commercial flights travelling in US skies a day. Credit: Bloomberg You can imagine two circles of a Venn diagram: One represents the Trump-spurred disruption and sense of perma-crisis he brings. A second one represents basic aviation safety and having a good time. Surely, the two circles can\u2019t stay separate forever. If and when they overlap, will they overlap on your holiday to the US? The US suffered its most deadly air crash in years in January when an American Airlines Flight collided with a US Army Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia, killing 67 people. A preliminary investigation raised questions about congestion in the area and the air traffic control staffing. A perhaps more pressing example in the era of Trump: air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty airport near New York lost radar vision and radio contact with flights on April 28. Some controllers were so upset afterwards that they took trauma leave. After the scare, the chief executive of United, which uses Newark as a hub, cut back flights for safety. One contributing factor is that Newark is a temporarily closed runway, set to reopen in June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading But to give a sense of the challenge for the US more broadly, consider that there are 3800 commercial flights a day in Australia. In the US, that number is closer to 27,500, with air traffic controllers monitoring and directing 5000 flights simultaneously in peak periods. The Federal Aviation Administration has been trying to upgrade its network of staff and equipment for decades, while attracting more air traffic controllers. There are now 14,000 air traffic controllers in the US, nearly 2000 of them hired last year. However, that still leaves a shortfall of 3000. Trump has largely inherited this problem, though he previously had four years as president to address it. However, it\u2019s far from clear that Trump is inclined or capable of improving the situation for US air traffic control. Immediately after the January crash near Washington, Trump blamed \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d hires as contributing to the ability of air traffic controllers to function. In a statement at the time, Trump claimed that under former president Joe Biden the FAA \u201cspecifically recruited and hired individuals with \u2018severe intellectual\u2019 disabilities [and] psychiatric issues ...\u2019\u201d When Trump returned to office in January, he came with billionaire campaign funder Elon Musk in tow, pushing a radical government-slashing project called DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFAA air traffic controllers are themselves exempt from DOGE cuts and are being recruited. But at more senior levels, the Washington Post reports, in keeping with the DOGE purges, there has been an exodus of people. American air traffic control is ripe for reform. As the Brookings Institute notes: \u201cThe consensus of countless commissions and expert reports is that air traffic management is a 24/7 high-tech service \u2018business\u2019 trapped in a regulatory agency that is constrained by federal budget and acquisition rules.\u201d That is, the budget for its modernisation keeps getting eaten up by the cost of maintaining legacy systems. United chief executive Scott Kirby reassured reporters in New York on May 13: \u201cAt Newark, first and foremost, it is safe. It is absolutely safe when these issues happen. Our pilots are trained with back-up procedures to keep the airline safe, and so whether you lose communications or radar, we have back-up procedures.\u201d Donald Trump is all about disruption and retribution. But what does that do for aviation safety? Credit: AP To his credit, Kirby has not shied away from the issue. Kirby has publicly highlighted the jam United and the US aviation sector has been put in by the FAA, and by Trump. In April, as the world watched and waited for the next shoe to drop in Trump\u2019s tariff strategy, Kirby offered not one but two earnings estimates, depending on whether the US president\u2019s moves triggered a recession or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, in his first 100 days in office, has imposed hiring freezes across government, stripped federal employees of job protections and fundamentally downsized the US government while centralising White House power. The head of the US Department of Transportation, Sean Duffy \u2013 an ex-congressman, prosecutor and former reality TV star, natch \u2013 has announced a plan expected to cost tens of billions of dollars to fix the US air traffic control system within four years. Trump supports the plan. But the devil is in the delivery. And to be sure, many air traffic controller bodies around the world are in the process of rebuilding staff. Airservices Australia, for example, is recruiting and training controllers. \u201cWe expect controller numbers to be back to surplus capacity by mid-year,\u201d a company spokesman said. But in the US, the problem is longstanding and deep-seated. Now uncertainty abounds for Americans and visiting travellers alike. And it\u2019s not just the fear of accidents. It\u2019s also the waiting, the delays and the disruptions on the ground that mark so much travel in the US. As for Newark Liberty Airport, Kirby cut back flights in light of the safety scare and issued two messages exhorting regulators to take further actiondespite his insistence that it\u2019s safe. Not everyone agrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliam McGee, a senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project, told NPR he just didn\u2019t \u201csee the seriousness and the sense of purpose from this administration\u201d to address the FAA problems. The US has been grappling with air traffic control issues for years. Credit: AP Despite Kirby\u2019s commentary on the FAA and US aviation, he is supportive of Trump\u2019s aspirations to bring back well-paid jobs to the US, saying the goal is \u201claudable\u201d. He notes that United is \u201cone of the few companies left in the country that creates the kind of jobs where you can make a six-digit income, you can support a family, buy a house and [send] your kids to college, even if you only have a high school education\u201d. Kirby says he is taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump on the economy and tariffs. Speaking the day after Trump announced a reduction in tariffs with China, Kirby said: \u201cEveryone should kind of take a breath because we\u2019re not at the end game yet. We\u2019re not at the new normal yet\u201d. Whatever the outcome, United is betting big on the future. After being the only American airline to fly to Australia through COVID lockdown, United is piling on more capacity for flights to Australia. Already, from November to March, United says it was the largest carrier between the US and Australia as measured by available seat miles. While the majority of those flights were Americans visiting Australia, Australians travelling to the US are well represented.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Crucially, it had done so as its energy demand increased. This is what makes the data so remarkable. Over recent years, the world \u2013 and China in particular \u2013 has deployed renewable energy technology far faster than expected. This was always good news. The problem has always been that demand for electricity kept growing faster than the supply of new renewables, so while there was more clean energy in global systems, emissions kept growing. Myllyvirta\u2019s new analysis, first published in Carbon Brief earlier this month, shows that China has finally broken this terrible nexus: emissions in China are finally falling as its use of electricity grows.\n\n\u201cBeing able to cut emissions while power demand not just grew but grew above the historical average is certainly a historic milestone, showing the scale that clean energy additions have reached in China,\u201d Myllyvirta told this masthead on Tuesday. And what happens in China affects us all. Loading \u201cNeedless to say, if the fall in emissions is sustained, that constitutes a major breakthrough for the global energy transition and the global climate effort, as China has been responsible for all of the net increase in CO2 emissions since the Paris climate conference, so an emission peak in China would highly likely enable global emissions to peak and decline,\u201d Myllyvirta said. \u201cWhether the falling trend in China\u2019s emissions continues depends strongly on the clean energy targets in China\u2019s upcoming Paris climate commitments and five-year plan; if the current rate of clean energy additions is continued, it is very likely that it will.\u201d\n\nSo far, the indications for this are good, at least politically. Though China\u2019s \u201call of the above\u201d energy policy includes new coal plants as well as clean power, the clean is outweighing the dirty. Those new coal plants are not only displacing older ones, they are running under capacity. And China remains determined to achieve energy independence at pace \u2013 which means generating energy domestically to cut its dependence on imports of oil, gas and coal. Energy analyst Tim Buckley notes that China is acting in self-interest here. As it expands its regional hegemony, China is determined both to free itself of coal, oil and gas imported via potentially vulnerable shipping lanes, and to dominate the technologies of the future. It is also worth noting that the slight dip in emissions may be a signal of a plateau in emissions rather than an ongoing decline, Buckley says.\n\nLoading This means that even as the Trump administration goes about unpicking former president Joe Biden\u2019s subsidies for green energy deployment to support the American shale oil industry, China is pushing harder on new clean tech. A speech made by Chinese President Xi Jinping last month also caught the attention of climate analysts and diplomats. China must accelerate the transition to clean energy, he said. \u201cClear waters and green mountains are just as valuable as gold and silver. Green transformation is not only the essential way to address climate change, but also a new engine for economic and social development.\u201d\n\nStriking a determinedly different tone from the Trump administration, he added, \u201cWe must deepen international co-operation. Solidarity and co-operation are needed more than ever as the world faces multiple, compounded challenges. We should rise above estrangement and conflict with openness and inclusiveness.\u201d But the key news in a colourful speech was buried in some of its most drab language. Xi said that in coming months China would announce a new emissions reduction target for 2035 that would cover \u201call economic sectors and all greenhouse gases\u201d. This is significant because in the past China has committed to reducing greenhouse pollution only relating to electricity production. China will increase its climate ambition across its economy, even as it beats its own climate targets. This is a good sign for crucial global climate talks to be held in Brazil later this year, before which other nations, including Australia, are expected to announce strong new 2035 targets. \u201cWhat\u2019s already clear is that China\u2019s recipe for peaking and reducing emissions is a combination of rapid electrification \u2013 not just in transportation but also in industry and buildings \u2013 with very large-scale additions of clean energy,\u201d Myllyvirta says.",

    "text": "Treat a visit to Rowe Street like a pub crawl, and discover a cult soup spot, an epic mart with a \u201csauce corner\u201d, barbecue eateries, night markets, grocers and lots more.\n\nSave Log in , register or subscribe to save recipes for later. You have reached your maximum number of saved items. Remove items from your saved list to add more. Share\n\nEastwood\u2019s food claim to fame, historically at least, is the Granny Smith apple. First discovered growing on Maria Ann \u201cGranny\u201d Smith\u2019s property back in the 1860s, the apple is still celebrated with an annual festival. But since Eastwood\u2019s commercial centre was pedestrianised in the 1990s, the suburb has had plenty more to offer in the culinary stakes. The catalyst has been a rapid shift in demographic: as of 2021, more than 48 per cent of residents claim Chinese ancestry, while nearly 9 per cent have roots in Korea. Rowe Street takes those figures off the page and renders them in full colour, with the Koreatown Project, backed by government funding, accelerating the transformation of the street\u2019s east end from local hub to delicious destination, as vital for Korean cooking and culture as Strathfield or Lidcombe. Jimmy Park, the project\u2019s manager, has witnessed the change first-hand. \u201cWhen I came in 1988, there were only two Korean shops on Rowe Street,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, it\u2019s more than 120.\u201d Those range from hairdressers and boutiques, to the grocers and restaurants that give the street its distinctive flavour. Cross the station, and Korean turns to Chinese, with broad regional representation and plenty outside the lines. Justin Li, a Ryde councillor who recommends treating a visit to Rowe Street a little like a pub crawl, says it\u2019s the demise of a fast-food giant that best represents Eastwood\u2019s evolution. \u201cAn old Chinatown institution, Super Bowl, recently opened on Rowe Street West, ironically where Eastwood\u2019s McDonald\u2019s once stood. It says a lot about the changing demographics and tastes locally over the last few decades.\u201d The choice of side is your own, but such is the scope that whichever you pick first, odds are it won\u2019t be too long before you\u2019re back for more. Hwagae Banchan\u2019s specialty is the array of side dishes \u2013 banchan \u2013 that accompany a Korean meal. Jennifer Soo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHwagae Banchan Shop Exit the station to the east, and you\u2019ll find a clutch of stalls specialising in Korean street food, including tteokbokki, the spicy rice cakes, and flash-fried Korean-style hot dogs. Stop at Hwagae Banchan Shop, though, and the specialty is the array of side dishes \u2013 banchan \u2013 that accompany a Korean meal. Classics include cabbage or spring onion kimchi tinted red with gochugaru, Korean chilli powder, or braised lotus root. Stock up, then grab some kimbap, Korea\u2019s answer to a sushi roll, to takeaway. 10 Railway Parade, Eastwood Rice cakes, or tteok, are the main draw at Siroo. Jennifer Soo Siroo Rice Cake Cafe Make for Rowe Street, perhaps drop into ginseng specialist Cheong Kwan Jang, then join the line at Siroo. With South Koreans now drinking 353 cups of coffee per head a year \u2013 more than double the global average \u2013 the nation\u2019s cafe culture is ever-expanding. That partly explains Siroo\u2019s popularity, but it\u2019s the rice cakes, or tteok, that are the main draw. Made each morning by owner Changhyun Lee, Siroo\u2019s tteok are characteristically chewy, with the injeolmi \u2013 made with sticky rice and finished with roasted soybean powder \u2013 a signature. Buy a pack, or try it in the cafe\u2019s viral shaved-ice dessert, bingsu. 106 Rowe Street, Eastwood, sirooricecakecafe.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiryang Gukbap soup shop channels South Korea\u2019s south-east. Jennifer Soo Miryang Just a couple of doors up from celebrated Korean-Chinese restaurant Biwon (try the jajangmyeon) is Miryang, a freshly opened soup restaurant channelling South Korea\u2019s south-east. The menu may be short, but the flavours are long and deep in everything from wagyu shank soup and gukbap with sundae \u2013 the Korean blood sausage \u2013 to the signature, light and aromatic Miryang-style pork soup loaded with spring onions. Season yours with salted shrimp and load up on fluffy rice \u2013 refills come free. 104 Rowe Street, Eastwood, instagram.com/miryang_eastwood The sauce section at Eastwood Mart. Jennifer Soo Eastwood Mart There\u2019s no shortage of grocers on this side of Eastwood station: S-Mart is an all-rounder, while KMALL09 (also in Lidcombe) stands out for its epic size, heaving shelves and range of K-beauty products. But Eastwood Mart, smack-bang on Rowe Street, is a classic. Big enough to have the range, small enough to feel personal, it\u2019s the place for bulk kimchi, noodles, seaweed and fresh vegetables. Don\u2019t leave without taking a turn around the \u201csauce corner\u201d or grabbing some mandu from the staff helming the hotplate out front.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n73 Rowe Street, Eastwood Getbawi specialises in hoe, or raw seafood. Jennifer Soo GetBawi Up the hill from K-bakery La Vigne and tucked into a shopping mall, newcomer GetBawi has quickly garnered a dedicated following. The reason? It\u2019s one of the few Sydney restaurants specialising in hoe, or raw seafood, served here on platters with the likes of perilla leaves for wrapping. Other highlights include spicy blue swimmer crab hotpot and the textural masterpiece that is yukhoe tang tang, featuring high-grade raw beef strewn with umami-rich octopus. 201/62-80 Rowe Street, Eastwood, instagram.com/getbawi Split a bowl of gamjatang soup with friends at Guk\u2019s Eedaero Gamjatang.

Its closure in February was mourned far and wide, but the good news is that in its place Eastwood now has its own outpost of Guk\u2019s Eedaero Gamjatang, Jongguk Lee\u2019s cult soup kitchen. Split a gamjatang with friends, and it\u2019ll be rich from long-simmered pork bones and doenjang, spicy from gochugaru and gochujang and loaded with perilla, potatoes and enoki mushrooms. Add a round of ice-cold Cass lager to keep the vibes high. 202/62-80 Rowe Street, Eastwood Photo: Jennifer Soo Dae Jang Kum Crossing the road, Uncles\u2019 Butchery, is a chance to score Korean barbecue meats \u2013 Black Onyx chuck tail flap, say \u2013 but if you\u2019d prefer to grill here and now, a block up is Dae Jang Kum, where the charcoal burns hot, and the beef intercostal in soy and sesame is the order.

Yet Mitchell is still rugby league\u2019s biggest star and accordingly, the man rugby league media flocks to most. Even when he won\u2019t talk. Shots of him playing golf in the rain and his Instagram account - endorsing South Sydney\u2019s social media campaign to ditch Accor Stadium for Allianz - have counted as Latrell news this week from NSW Origin camp. Along with updates that Latrell still ain\u2019t talking. And conjecture about whether he should be. It hasn\u2019t always been this way. More just Mitchell\u2019s latest wrestle in his complicated relationship with the fourth estate, not to mention his place in the rugby league ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatrell Mitchell: the man everyone wants a piece of. Credit: Michael Howard Now in his tenth season of first-grade, Mitchell has occupied rare air for years as far as newsworthiness goes. No-one in rugby league compares. For what he does on the field that no-one else can. And what he says off the field that no-one else will. Since the internet came into being, only Jarryd Hayne has broken it like Mitchell in this game. Though you suspect Andrew Johns would have rivalled them if his career - mercifully for the Eighth Immortal - hadn\u2019t just missed the rise of social media. Loading Brisbane\u2019s enigmatic Reece Walsh might still match Mitchell some day, though more headlines are the last thing he or the Broncos need. Nick Kyrgios is probably the only Australian athlete who trumps South Sydney\u2019s superstar in turning the heads of Sydney-based editors and TV producers chasing clicks, comments and views.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitchell\u2019s lasting impact on his Indigenous people will always, rightly, leave all that in the shade. I still recall standing in the SCG sheds in 2019, when he was just 22 and still a Rooster, as he addressed the torrent of racial abuse he was receiving on social media for the first time. I asked Mitchell if he truly grasped the pile-on coming his way. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Everything that is said about Aboriginal people really affects me,\u201d was his simple, lasting reply. On Indigenous issues and representation, no voice has rung louder or longer than Mitchell\u2019s in Australian sport since. Latrell Mitchell before an Indigenous All Stars game. Credit: NRL Photos For a while afterwards, Mitchell revelled in the lighter side of breaking the world wide web too. When the Rabbitohs flew him to Philadelphia to work with reconditioning guru Bill Knowles in 2022, Mitchell returned with his hamstrings in order and a new outlook on his rugby league life. \u201cI\u2019ve been having fun, that\u2019s always been me, I\u2019ve just been perceived as someone else,\u201d Mitchell told colleague Christian Nicolussi during a mid-season South Sydney media day, conducting no less than a dozen interviews in the Redfern Oval stands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it all my life, I\u2019ve talked a big game but always backed it up. \u201cI think a lot more players need to be outspoken and confident in themselves, and understand the power you have in this game\u2026 In the US they are funny, and I took a lot out of the way they talk. \u201cThey know the power they have. We need to start understanding that.\u201d Good times for all. Because Mitchell did back himself up with big game after big game in a career-best run. And delivered a slew of headline-worthy quotes to boot. He declared \u201cthat NSW jersey is mine\u201d after terrorising incumbent Blues centre Matt Burton one Friday night, laughed off accusations of lying down to draw a penalty with \u201ccall me Trell Milk\u201d and \u201cused [the media] to my advantage and the Roosters took the bait\u201d when tensions were at their highest against his former club and Mitchell was being booed relentlessly. Box office: Latrell Mitchell roars to the crowd after nailing a sideline conversion against the Roosters in 2022. Credit: Getty Two years on, Mitchell understands the power he also wields in not speaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the most tumultuous period of his career, when he briefly considered walking away from the game and Souths pondered similarly uncomfortable questions about his future at the club, Mitchell needed Wayne Bennett like never before. Forget the side-mouth, single word answers and cranky old Wayne routine. The 75-year-old uses the media to his advantage better than anyone. Bennett\u2019s return to the Rabbitohs coincided with Mitchell needing to put his head down. Needing to repay the club for a hellish campaign that ended with a foot injury, one-game ban and $40,000 in NRL and South Sydney fines (with a further $80,000 fine suspended) for the photos of him standing over a white substance in a Dubbo hotel room. The Mitchell narrative of last year - which also included his involvement in the Spencer Leniu-Ezra Mam racism saga, an expletive-laden Triple M interview and suspension for belting Shaun Johnson - was wilder than ever as it grew untenable. Wayne Bennett returned to South Sydney when Latrell Mitchell needed him most. Credit: Getty Nine months of no comment is Mitchell, with South Sydney\u2019s backing, taking charge of the narrative and letting \u201chis footy do the talking\u201d - one of his favourite refrains over the years. Nine months of no comment also leaves that potentially career-defining drama in Dubbo hanging in the air though. It remains the reference point for any reporter worth their salt because Mitchell has never addressed it himself.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "It's now cheaper to buy Kiwi butter in Australian supermarkets than in New Zealand stores.\n\nBuying local butter in New Zealand has become prohibitively expensive for local shoppers. Source: Michael Dahlstrom\n\nA \u201cperfect storm\u201d has led to butter prices increasing by more than 65 per cent over the last year in New Zealand, forcing one popular bakery to buy it from Australia instead.\n\nKaye\u2019s Bakery owner Luella Penniall told Yahoo News she always tries to buy local butter, but lately the price has been too high. Her broker often advises her to import her massive multi-tonne order of butter from Australia, where she can make greater savings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s craziness. There could be $1.50 a kilo difference, and when you\u2019re buying $50,000 or $100,000 worth at a time, that adds up to a lot,\u201d she said.\n\nContracts with retailers who sell her produce prevent her from suddenly altering her price, so continuing to always use local butter as the cost soars would come at a massive financial cost. Besides, increasing the price of her famous cakes, slices and biscuits would harm Kiwi shoppers who are already struggling with the cost of living.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a New Zealand manufacturer and I don\u2019t want my products to become unaffordable,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: \ud83c\udf0f Grocery shop brings New Zealand dad to tears after move to Australia\n\nA 400-gram packet of Westgold sells at Woolworths for NZ$9.95 (A$9.16) locally, but the price in the Australian supermarket is $6.50. Source: Michael Dahlstrom/Woolworths\n\nWoolworths selling NZ butter cheaper to Aussie customers\n\nKiwi shoppers are also feeling the pinch at the country's three major supermarkets, Woolworths, PAKnSAVE and New World.\n\nAt Woolworths, New Zealand-made 400-gram packs of Westgold sell for NZ$9.95 (A$9.16) locally, but the price drops to just $6.50 in Australian stores. While 250-gram packs of New Zealand's famous Mainland butter are selling for $8.90 ($8.15) in New Zealand versus $6.50 in Australian stores.\n\nWhy are New Zealand butter prices so high?\n\nAccording to an international supply chain expert, a major reason Kiwis are charged high prices for their own butter is that it\u2019s in high demand overseas, where it can be bought at a \"good price\" in greater amounts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNew Zealand butter is a premium product, and it\u2019s really well recognised around the world,\u201d Australian National University business and economics lecturer David Leaney explained.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar is struggling due to concerns about a recession, China\u2019s slumping economy, and the threat of tariffs from US President Donald Trump. This makes it more affordable right now for overseas buyers to use their strong currencies to snap up Kiwi butter.\n\nDemand is also being driven by problems in the northern hemisphere with extreme weather and crop failure leading to shortages. This reduced competition is also leading to the New Zealand product attracting a premium.\n\nWhy farmers are also paying more to make butter\n\nLooking domestically, New Zealand farmers are facing ongoing pressures as drought continues to increase the cost of raising animals. Buying and transporting extra feed comes with an added cost. And when cattle consume supplementary feed rather than paddock grass the fat concentration of the milk is altered, further impacting the sale price.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt's unusual for all of the international factors to line up all in the same direction. And it's even more unusual for all the domestic ones to do the same. It\u2019s a perfect storm at the moment,\u201d Leaney said.\n\nAustralians also paying higher prices due to overseas contracts\n\nTravelling around New Zealand, it\u2019s often astonishing to see how little local fresh fruit and vegetables are available in supermarkets. When orchards and backyard trees are sprouting lemons, oranges and apples, retail shelves are lined with American-grown fruit.\n\nThis is driven by producers being locked into big international contracts, which buy a greater volume of food than local retailers need.\n\n\u201cEven if they wanted to sell locally at a higher price, they\u2019ve already been lured in by big contracts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe same thing happens with Australia\u2019s natural gas. We signed some really big contracts to supply gas at a huge volume to overseas markets, with prices locked in. And even though we could sell it for more domestically, we can't, because we\u2019re locked into those contracts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou end up with gas going overseas, and then being imported back here at a higher price.\u201d\n\nLeaney thinks increasing butter prices will be temporary, and the price will stabilise due to market forces.\n\nHe compares the situation to eggs in Australia, where avian influenza outbreaks led to shortages and increased prices. While prices no longer seem to be increasing, they\u2019re unlikely to drop again unless economic drivers change.\n\n\u201cThe problem is hard to fix. It self-adjusts because sometimes not all of the factors will keep aligning. Exchange rates could change, or the gap in the market will be filled by someone else. Once you become the most expensive option, then suddenly people will start looking for the second or third,\u201d Leaney said.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

    "text": "Virgin angered passengers by installing what has been described as a 'shower curtain' to divide business and economy classes. Source: Australianfrequentflyer/serfty\n\nVirgin Australia is in the throes of a massive $110 million upgrade to its Boeing 737 airliners, aimed at enhancing the guest experience. However, the airline has been forced to respond after a 'disappointing' detail was spotted on a recent flight \u2014 and passengers can expect to see it until at least next year.\n\nCabin reconfigurations, which have added extra rows of seating in the planes, saw the removal of perspex dividers that separate economy and business classes. Now, what's replaced it is what passengers have described as a \"shower curtain\" in a move that has frustrated many.\n\nHowever, Virgin Australia has defended the move, assuring Aussies the dividers are temporary. \"Virgin Australia is currently rolling out new cabin dividers as part of the refurbishment of our Boeing 737 interiors,\" a spokesperson told Yahoo News.\n\n\"The first of which includes the installation of a cross-aisle curtain between Business and Economy class to help manage guest flow. From early next year, divider panels will be mounted underneath the overhead bins on either side of the curtain, providing a more defined partition between cabins.\"\n\nVirgin is in the process of upgrading its fleet of airplanes. Source: Getty\n\nIt's understood that this type of divider is used in many airlines with narrowbody aircraft around the world and allows for more efficient use of floor space in the Economy cabin. However, some customers have questioned why the airline didn't simply wait to do the perspex upgrade.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It seriously looks like someone has ducked down to Spotlight and bought something off the specials table,\" one traveller lamented.\n\nAnother speculated that the purpose of the curtain was to prevent economy passengers from using the forward toilet, usually reserved for business class passengers.\n\n\"Could have waited until the perspect was finished and installed altogether next year,\" they said.\n\nWhat else is Virgin Australia upgrading?\n\nThe upgrade will see an extra six to 12 economy seats added to the planes.\n\nBoth business and economy have had new or refurbished seating implemented in the 737s, with in-seat power in both classes. Wi-Fi and in-flight entertainment via passengers' own devices are also a new feature on the upgraded planes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe airline claims that larger overhead lockers have been installed so that 50 per cent more carry-on baggage can fit, although there will be no increase in the individual passenger allowance.\n\nIt's expected the works will be completed in the next two years, subject to operational requirements.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
