    "text": "Australian cattle farmers have been dealt a blow after China announced it would cap beef imports to better protect its own producers.\n\nCOVID-era trade ruptures with China had been seemingly repaired in recent years, but 2026 brings fresh frustrations for the beef industry.\n\n\"So we have a billion dollars worth of beef that will need to go to other markets,\" Cattle Australia chair Garry Edwards said.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government was in talks with China over the new tariffs.\ufeff (Nine)\n\nFrom yesterday, China is slapping limits on beef imports from overseas. Anything exceeding the cap will be hit with a 55 per cent tax rate, with the aim by China to protect its own domestic productions.\n\n\"The large volume of beef that's been redirected from the American market into China has gone in there at very low prices, and that's had a direct impact on Chinese beef producers,\" Edwards said.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government was in talks with China over the new tariffs.\ufeff\n\n\"This is something that wasn't Australia being singled out. This is a general position that China has put,\" Albanese said.\n\nOpposition Leader Sussan Ley said the Albanese government should have been able to stop the tariffs impacting Australian farmers.\n\n\"Australia should not be included in any of these arrangements when it comes to restrictions,\" she said.\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud called on Albanese and Trade Minister Don Farrell to \"make urgent representations to their counterparts in Beijing\".\n\nCattle Australia chair Garry Edwards. (Nine)\n\nThe unexpected upside for Australian consumers is the possibility that more beef not being sold offshore will result in a surplus that needs to be sold domestically, which could cause prices to be cut.\n\n\"We may see a reduction in domestic beef prices as a result, because you'll see more high-quality beef available within the domestic market,\" Edwards said.\n\nDespite the government's talks with China, Albanese says other countries may just get more Australian beef.",

(Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\nWill interest rates rise in 2026?\n\nIt's possible, and some banks think we'll get a hike as soon as February 3.\n\n\"With what we know at the moment, I don't think there are interest rate cuts on the horizon for the foreseeable future,\" RBA Governor Michele Bullock said after the central bank's final rates decision of the year on December 9 .\n\n\"The question is, is it just an extended hold from here, or is it a possibility of a rate rise?\n\n\"They are the two things the board will be looking closely at coming into the new year.\"\n\nThose hawkish comments have led a range of economists to tip a rate hike in 2026.\n\nCommonwealth Bank head of Australian economics Belinda Allen says the first meeting of the year will be a live one, and both CBA and NAB are predicting a 25-basis-point increase on the first meeting of the year.\n\nNAB has forecast even more pain, pencilling in a further cut in May.\n\nThe market is more pessimistic.\n\n\ufeff The market has been pricing in around a 27 per cent chance of a hike in February (that figure has been both slightly higher and lower throughout late December, but was at zero at the start of the month), and an end-year cash rate of about 4 per cent.\n\nNot everyone agrees with that, though.\n\nThe other half of the big four banks, Westpac and ANZ, are predicting a year of holds, as are some economists.\n\n\"We expect to see the cash rate remain at 3.6 per cent in 2026, with the swing back to rate hikes more a story for 2027,\" AMP chief economist Shane Oliver wrote.\n\n\"But we concede that the risks look like they are now a bit more to the upside on rates in 2026.\n\n\"However, our assessment is that the swing in the money market from expecting 2 or 3 more cuts after the August RBA meeting to now expecting nearly two hikes (in 2026) is premature and a bit too extreme.\"\n\nMortgage holders appear to have little hope for a rate cut in the near future. (Joe Armao/The Age)\n\nWhy aren't interest rates expected to come down?\n\nCasual observers \u2013 particularly those with a mortgage \u2013 might be wondering why we're suddenly talking about the prospect of rate hikes, not cuts.\n\nAfter all, it was only a few months ago that economists were talking about the cash rate settling around 3.1 per cent.\n\nThe reason for the turnaround is an unexpected surge in inflation.\n\nHaving fallen back into the central bank's target band of 2-3 per cent, the consumer price index (CPI) jumped to 3.2 per cent in the September quarter and again to 3.8 per cent in October, with underlying inflation not too far behind.\n\n\ufeff The data-driven RBA will get two new batches of inflation figures before its February decision \u2013 for November on January 7 and December on the 28th.\n\nIf inflation cools off, so too will the chance of a rate hike.\n\nBut if it comes in hot once again, then mortgage holders will have every right to feel nervous about the first rates decision of the year.\n\n\"If trimmed mean inflation in the December quarter does not fall back as we expect (and comes in around 0.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter or more), then a hike as early as February is possible,\" Oliver said.\n\n\"December quarter CPI inflation is the key to what happens early next year on rates.\"",

    "text": "Just weeks before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Chinese authorities restricted half of all private cars from the city's roads, alternating daily bans for number plates ending in even and odd numbers.\n\nThe radical move was just one of a suite of measures aiming to curb the city's choking smog, alongside factory closures and halts on construction.\n\nOver decades of intensive development, residents had become accustomed to smog that not only caused untold respiratory and health problems but was also threatening to derail the Games.\n\nA view from the ABC's office in Beijing on the eve of the 2008 Olympics opening ceremony. (ABC)\n\nEven after the haze cleared, complaints by athletes and visiting media clouded the Games' legacy, spurring a renewed campaign of pollution reduction in China.\n\nAs China's economy kept growing after 2008, its emissions of aerosols \u2014 small particles in the air, distinct from greenhouse gases \u2014 peaked and then dropped rapidly.\n\nAerosols can include particles emitted by burning fossil fuels, others by volcanic eruptions or bushfires \u2014 even airborne sea salt is considered an aerosol.\n\nWhen enough of them are concentrated in one place, haze can become visible, and weather conditions, including temperature and rainfall, may be impacted.\n\nLikewise, when emissions are reduced, that can cause a significant change, too.\n\nSuch has been the success of China's air-cleaning effort since the 2010s that researchers have now linked it to changes in weather far beyond its borders, including in Australia.\n\nResearchers have also tied it to global temperature rises as the aerosols' masking effect on global warming is diminished.\n\nReflecting heat, changing rain\n\nUnlike greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, most aerosols reflect sunlight away from Earth and produce a cooling effect.\n\nCSIRO scientist Melita Keywood likened their effect to the colour of a roof over a home.\n\n\"[Sulphate aerosols] are like a white roof that reflects light, but a black roof absorbs heat,\" she said.\n\n\"In some countries where it's cold, you might want to have a black roof, but in Australia you probably want to have a white roof.\"\n\nDark roofs linked to hotter homes Research has found dark-roofed homes are as much as 10 degrees warmer than homes with light-coloured roofs.\n\nMany aerosols also interact with water vapour in the air, affecting clouds and rainfall both positively and negatively.\n\nLate in 2025, a team of Chinese researchers published a paper linking Australia's hot and dry weather in the 2010s to China's aerosol reductions.\n\nThey found weather systems were impacted thousands of kilometres across the Pacific, reducing moisture across large parts of Australia and significantly raising the risk of bushfires in all states and territories.\n\nDespite Australia's relatively high rainfall since 2020, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology professor Yang Yang, who was among the study's authors, said changes in China have continued to impact Australian weather.\n\n\"The marked increase in Australian rainfall after 2020 does not invalidate conclusions about the influence of Chinese aerosols on Australia's climate,\" he said.\n\n\"Rather, it indicates that during this later period, large-scale climate variability exerted a stronger influence.\"\n\nMultiple climate scientists said more work was needed to properly understand the effect of China's emission reduction on Australian weather.\n\n\"[2019] came at the end of a three-year drought, so you've got to be really careful in drawing too many conclusions from that,\" University of Southern Queensland's Tim Cowan said.\n\nNonetheless, some researchers have argued the effect of China's clean-up has been felt even further afield.\n\nFrom China across the globe\n\nLast year, a team of mostly European climate scientists labelled East Asian aerosol reductions as the biggest reason for the acceleration of global warming since 2010.\n\nOne of them, Finnish Meteorological Institute researcher Joonas Merikanto, said China's changes had disrupted continental weather patterns, spreading the impact.\n\n\"It affects the local circulation patterns over the Pacific and, for example, influences the monsoon precipitation over the Asian region,\" he said.\n\nJoonas Merikanto says China's pollution clean-up has accelerated global warming since 2013. (Supplied: Joonas Merikanto)\n\nScientists frequently liken the impact of removing pollution to \"unmasking\" or \"revealing\" warming that had already been caused by greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nDecades before China's emissions peaked, Europe's effort to cut pollution demonstrated this effect.\n\n\"[Europe] was heavily polluted in the 80s,\" Leipzig University professor of theoretical meteorology Johannes Quaas said.\n\n\" I grew up in an industrial area. I know the smell of sulphuric acid in the air from playing as a child outside when I shouldn't. \"\n\nClimate scientist Karsten Haustein estimated that most central European countries have experienced almost 3 degrees Celsius of warming since pre-industrial times, exacerbated when the cooling effect of that pollution was removed.\n\n\"Probably a bit more than a degree of extra warming was essentially just hidden by the aerosols,\" he said.\n\nHazy understanding\n\nIn 2024, Tim Cowan was among a group of researchers who found Asian aerosol emissions had increased Australia's monsoon rainfall in the decades before China's historic clean-up.\n\n\"Observations show a significant increase in Australian summer monsoon rainfall since the mid-twentieth century,\" the researchers wrote in a paper published in The Journal of Climate.\n\n\" Our results suggest that Asian anthropogenic aerosol emissions played a key role in the observed increase in Australian summer monsoon rainfall from 1930 to 2014. \"\n\nIn 2024, researchers found Asia's aerosol emissions had strengthened Australia's monsoon rains in preceding decades. (Supplied: James Cobain)\n\nThis aligns with Professor Yang's assertion that China's reduction of its aerosol emissions had the opposite effect on Australian rainfall from 2013.\n\nHowever, there are relatively few papers besides these to compare the results.\n\nDr Cowan said Australia was probably not pulling its weight in aerosol research.\n\n\"I can only name a handful of people that have looked at aerosols since the time I finished my PhD [in 2015],\" he said.\n\nDr Keywood agreed Australia had not placed as much research attention on aerosols as other countries and said they would become more important as the climate warms.\n\n\"It's something that's kind of always been in the hard basket because it's quite [computationally] intensive,\" she said.\n\nThis is particularly true when studying rainfall, one of the most closely watched weather statistics in Australia.\n\nKnowing how Australian rain might be affected by Chinese aerosols is made harder by the different effects of the particles and complex weather systems transporting them across the Pacific.\n\n\"One of the key things you need to produce rain is a cloud condensation nuclei particle, and it turns out that the things that are really good at that are like sulphate,\" Ms Keywood said.\n\n\"But [other aerosols] like black carbon don't like water.\"\n\nBlack carbon is emitted by industrial processes, agricultural burning and diesel engines. (ABC)\n\nMore changes coming\n\nWhile scientists unpack the consequences of China's dramatic smog reversal, more of Australia's Asian neighbours are seeking to emulate its success.\n\nIn India and Bangladesh, air pollution is a persistent and deadly problem linked to millions of excess deaths each year and increasingly acidic rainfall.\n\nClimate experts agree it is imperative to reduce the pollution, but acknowledge it will likely increase heating and extreme weather in the South Asian region.\n\n\"From the temperature point of view, there will definitely be a local increase,\" Dr Haustein said.\n\n\" If we remove the [aerosols it] means more flooding in Bangladesh, and in India, maybe issues with the pre-monsoon, which is really important for agriculture. \"\n\nKarsten Haustein says emissions from Asian countries like China and Indonesia affect Australian weather differently. (Supplied: Swen Reichhold)\n\nHowever, when asked how this might affect the Pacific and Australia, Dr Haustein was hesitant to make such clear predictions.\n\n\"Disentangling the remote effects [of aerosols], not only the regional effects \u2026 it's crazy difficult,\" he said.\n\nOnly 2,000 kilometres from Australia, Indonesia's capital Jakarta, now recognised by the UN as the world's largest city, also ranks among the most polluted metro areas.\n\n\"I think the issue now for Australia is we feel like we're fairly far removed from the problem [of aerosol pollution],\" Dr Cowan said.\n\n\"I think our understanding of the role aerosols play in driving our climate I think it's fairly rudimentary.\"",

    "text": "In some of the darkest days in the political relationship between Australia and China, trade became a tool to inflict pain.\n\nThe early 2020s trade war saw China slap higher tariffs on Australian wine and barley, impose biosecurity measures against beef and timber and ban lobsters and even some coal.\n\nIt took four long years for the trade relationship to be resolved, and even longer for the political friendship to be rekindled.\n\nBut the devastating consequences from that time still cast a long shadow of lingering fear within trade circles.\n\nSo, it's no wonder panic is rippling across the industry since Beijing slapped huge new tariffs on Aussie beef this week.\n\nAustralian beef, seen on shelves in the US, was exported at record levels this year. (Supplied: Dalene Wray)\n\nFears of larger trade crackdown\n\nQuestions were immediately raised about whether this was a result of political breakdown between the two countries, despite the relationship appearing healthy and thriving.\n\nAnd the bigger fear is whether this could be the start of a larger trade crackdown by Beijing.\n\nThe answer, as with most issues in China, is rarely simple.\n\nChina's Ministry of Finance and Commerce announced that from the start of 2026, several countries, including Australia, would be impacted by new beef import tariffs.\n\nThe trade measures included a new 55 per cent fee on beef imports that exceeded an annual quota. A quota that has been exceeded by a large margin in the past.\n\nChina's commerce ministry on Wednesday explained the tariffs, also impacting Brazil and the United States, were designed to protect the burgeoning domestic cattle industry from oversupply.\n\nIn other words \u2014 China wants more of its people to eat its own beef, and not the prized stuff from overseas.\n\nLoading\n\nAustralian industry 'disappointed'\n\nThe announcement sent a wave of anger through Australia's beef industry, which said it was \"extremely disappointed\", and suggested Australian leaders needed to go in to fight against Beijing.\n\nBut if you've looked at China's domestic economy recently, the move shouldn't come as much of a surprise.\n\nChina's domestic economy is in deep trouble, plagued by a real-estate crisis, local government debt, and a slowdown in manufacturing and infrastructure investment.\n\nChina's consumers are also saving more and spending less.\n\nTo combat its sluggish financial sector, Beijing has been focusing on stimulating local industries \u2014 including beef \u2014 to boost local capacity and demand.\n\nBut as local production has climbed, so too has the importation of more treasured foreign beef, resulting in an oversupply and driving down local prices.\n\nThis week's announcement is Beijing's attempt to address that, by using trade policy to reach its very public goals of boosting domestic economic growth.\n\nChina is facing extra pressure right now to improve its local fortunes, as it stares down threats from major overseas partners, like the European Union, which is threatening its own tariffs after a surge in Chinese imports.\n\nLoading...\n\nA crucial domestic market\n\nWith China's export market under threat, its domestic market becomes more important than ever.\n\nAustralia's beef export industry says it is no threat to China's local production, but China clearly disagrees.\n\nIn fact, in the last year, Australian imports of beef have surged into Beijing in levels not seen since before the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly filling a gap left by US beef after Donald Trump unleashed a tit-for-tat tariff war.\n\nThe new quota set by China for Australian beef in 2026 is almost exactly the same as the quota for 2025, which Australia exceeded by about 100,000 tonnes.\n\nThat is about a third of Australia's beef export total to China in the last year.\n\nBut in several successive years before 2025, Australia's beef export capacity was always well below threshold levels.\n\nIt's likely Beijing's new measures are aimed at trying to rein in an Australian surge and managing local growth, rather than a direct target on Australia.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese doesn't seem too concerned about the change and isn't likely to take this as a political fracture in his relationship with China's leader Xi Jinping.\n\nAnd although there's no overt political undertone to these new tariffs, there is still one important message: global trade is increasingly delicate, especially as Beijing sets its sights on becoming the largest and most powerful economy in the world.",

    "text": "The signs were evident early on in Usman Khawaja's career that he would do things his own way.\n\nKhawaja made his international debut for Australia in the 2011 New Year's Test against England in Sydney \u2014 during an Ashes series that was otherwise quite forgettable from an Australian perspective.\n\nComing in to the Australian side to replace injured skipper Ricky Ponting, Khawaja became the first Australian Test debutant to bat at number three since Justin Langer 18 years prior and quickly made an impression.\n\nKhawaja replaced the injured Ricky Ponting (right) when he made his debut in the final Test of the 2010-11 Ashes. (Getty Images: Hamish Blair)\n\nFacing up to towering English paceman Chris Tremlett, Khawaja neatly flicked the first ball of his Test career off his hips for two before sending his second ball screaming to the boundary via a full-blooded pull shot.\n\nThe first eight balls of Khawaja's Test career yielded 15 runs. The fluency and audacity of the young Khawaja was a far cry from the dogged veteran fighter he would become later in his career.\n\nThat New Year's Test \u2014 which England won by an innings and 83 runs \u2014 has gone down in infamy if you're Australian, and in folklore if you're English. Before last month's Boxing Day Test, it was England's most recent Test win Down Under.\n\n'My greatest blessings': Khawaja's emotional retirement message Australia batter Usman Khawaja will retire after the fifth and final Ashes Test at the SCG, which starts on Sunday.\n\nIn Australia's side on that occasion, alongside Khawaja, were fellow youngsters Steve Smith and Phillip Hughes. The trio should have formed the backbone of a strong Australian batting line-up for the decade and a half that followed but would play just one further Test together before Hughes's tragic death in November 2014.\n\nKhawaja will retire having played 88 Tests for Australia, yet it feels as if he could've easily played 20 more.\n\nSmith is currently at 122 Tests and counting, while David Warner \u2014 who made his Test debut shortly after Khawaja \u2014 retired having played 112. Nathan Lyon \u2014 who also debuted in 2011 \u2014 currently has 141 Test appearances.\n\nKhawaja's numbers in the one-day format also suggest he should have logged far more than 40 ODI appearances for his country \u2014 with the last of those coming in the 2019 World Cup.\n\nLike many a prodigious young Australian cricketer, Khawaja was axed from the Test team early on and faced a constant uphill battle to become a regular fixture in the side during the first half of his career.\n\nSince his debut at the start of 2011, Khawaja endured through four separate calendar years where he didn't play a single Test for Australia \u2014 two of those came in 2020 and 2021 as Australia trialled a conveyor belt of openers alongside Warner.\n\nKhawaja (left) and Warner became a prolific opening partnership from 2022. (Getty Images: Ryan Pierse)\n\nCould Khawaja have played more throughout that period? His Shield numbers from the seasons he wasn't selected aren't all that favourable, and Khawaja would likely argue that being ignored for those two years led to what came afterwards.\n\nOnce Khawaja was reinstated for the New Year's Test in 2022 against England, he did not leave any room for doubts over whether he belonged at the top level, becoming one of the most prolific Test openers in the world.\n\nFor someone who has been in and out of Australia's Test side since making his debut, Khawaja's career numbers are gaudier than you think.\n\nKhawaja will have a chance at the SCG to add to his 16 Test centuries for Australia. (AP Photo: Eranga Jayawardena)\n\nHis 6,206 Test runs are more than the career marks of Adam Gilchrist, Ian Chappell and Bill Lawry, with a chance to surpass Michael Hussey if he scores just 30 next week. He also has more Test centuries (16) than Damien Martyn, Michael Slater and Dean Jones.\n\nImportantly, Khawaja's game has travelled well throughout his Test career, with seven of his Test tons coming outside of Australia in India, England, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, New Zealand and the UAE. For comparison's sake, Warner scored just six \u2014 three in South Africa, two in Bangladesh and one in Dubai.\n\nKhawaja's overall average outside of Australia is 40.18 and his 48.05 average as an opener, where he played half his Tests, are both figures comparable to some of the great top-order players in Test history.\n\nYet it's likely that all those numbers will pale in comparison to what his true generational impact has been as Australia's first Muslim Test cricketer.\n\nDespite Australia being a proudly multicultural nation, its men's cricket team has historically been one devoid of diversity.\n\nIt was only in last year's Perth Test that two Indigenous players \u2014 Brendan Doggett and Scott Boland \u2014 represented Australia's men's side in a Test match for the first time, a record fellow Indigenous paceman Jason Gillespie suggested the country shouldn't be proud of.\n\nThe Pakistan-born Khawaja has importantly understood his platform as a trailblazer in the Australian men's cricket team.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nHe has not been shy about speaking openly about the struggles he faced as a person of colour coming through the ranks, and the systemic issues surrounding cricket's pathways programs that have held back others like him.\n\nKhawaja is proudly and unapologetically Muslim and has explained how his faith has helped his career. His presence has raised awareness of Islam within the Australian team. Khawaja's teammates often celebrate series wins with non-alcoholic champagne out of respect for his faith.\n\nHow Usman Khawaja is changing the face of Australian cricket Trailblazer Usman Khawaja talks about racism in cricket and urges Cricket Australia to diversify for the sake of the game.\n\nThe Test team hasn't traditionally been a place where centuries have been followed by celebrations borrowed from LeBron James, yet Khawaja has slowly changed those rigid norms too.\n\nKhawaja has been more than happy to break ground as someone of a South Asian background in a predominantly white space. His ability to deal with all that comes with the territory makes it easier for the next Usman Khawaja coming through the ranks in future generations.\n\n\"Never let anyone convince you that you can't, because if they do convince you, then you never will,\" he said while announcing his retirement at the SCG.\n\n\"I'm a proud Muslim coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team. Look at me now. And you can do the same.\"\n\nThe impact of Khawaja's career is already evident with players of South Asian descent such as Harjas Singh, Harkirat Bajwa, Yash Deshmukh and Aryan Sharma having recently represented Australia at the Under-19 level.\n\nPlayers such as Australian Under-19 star Harjas Singh (pictured) have Khawaja to look towards for representation in the Test team. (Getty Images: Alex Davidson/ICC)\n\nPlayers such as Jason and Tanveer Sangha, Gurinder Sandhu and Nivethan Radhakrishnan being regulars at the domestic level suggest Australian cricket's diversity problem is slowly improving, and Khawaja is largely to thank.\n\nYet, a lack of diversity hasn't dissipated Khawaja's love for Australian cricket one bit.\n\nKhawaja is a fighter through and through. It is embodied in the way he has worked himself back into the team on multiple occasions and in the number of times he has dug in to win or save a Test match for his country in the face of adversity.\n\nKhawaja's spirit and never-say-die attitude is as Australian as it gets.\n\nAlongside Australian men's captain Pat Cummins, Khawaja is the prototypical modern-day athlete who is completely unafraid to touch on political and societal issues, showing his successors the importance of being a role model both on and off the field.\n\nIt is fitting that just as it looked like the end of Khawaja's career would be decided for him earlier this summer, he fought his way back in once again \u2014 riding a bit of luck in the process \u2014 to write his own fairytale ending.\n\nIf you've followed Khawaja's career over the last 15 years, then you'll know he'll have had it no other way.",

    "text": "Australia's transport industry is warning of a truck driver shortage crisis as its workforce shrinks.\n\nThe national road transport association, NatRoad, said the problem stems from a number of factors, including an aging workforce.\n\nAccording to NatRoad there is currently a shortfall of around 28,000 truck drivers across Australia, which is forecast to increase to 78,000 unfilled positions by 2029.\n\nThat would be a 26 per cent drop on the current national truckie workforce of 189,900 drivers.\n\nAnd this comes as the Australian Logistics Council projected the current 223 billion tonne kilometres of road freight volumes will grow by around 56 per cent between 2018 and 2040.\n\nNatRoad said less than 5.4 per cent of the current driver workforce were aged 25 years or younger, while 47 per cent were 55 years or older.\n\nMr Hannifey has been an active member of the industry on a number of issues including road safety. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard)\n\nRoad safety and transport advocate Rod Hannifey said the issue has been building for several years, as the industry has struggled to bring new drivers through to bolster its ranks.\n\n\"Drivers often came up through families \u2014 you'd take your kids with you, they'd fall in love with the trucks and eventually join the industry,\" he said.\n\n\"That can't happen now because of insurance and restrictions.\n\n\"Kids can't come in the cab, so they never get exposed to it, and once they choose another job, we don't get them back.\"\n\nMr Hannifey also identified the fines and penalties truck drivers faced as a deterrent.\n\nMr Hannifey said truck drivers are being squeezed by strong penalties and undesirable work conditions. (ABC New England: Lara Webster)\n\n\"We understand the need to operate safely and legally, but the framework we work under is designed by people who don't have to live by it,\" he said.\n\n\"Penalties can be extreme, for things like driving 10 minutes longer than scheduled because you need a shower, toilet, or a decent meal.\n\n\"Drivers constantly worry about what they'll get pinged for next.\n\n\"It scares people out of the industry.\"\n\nA growing problem\n\nNatRoad chief executive Warren Clark said unless the current trajectory was changed, there would be a sizeable shortfall of drivers before 2030.\n\n\"With the growth in freight tasks and what's required of transport, estimates suggest there will be more than 78,000 unfilled positions by 2029,\" he said.\n\nMr Clark said the organisation is looking into the best way to bring younger drivers into the industry. (Supplied: NatRoad)\n\nBut, Mr Clark said the shortage had an impact beyond the driver's cabin.\n\n\"Everything that appears on your table or in your house has, at some point, travelled on a truck.\"\n\nMr Clark said resolving the issue would involve creating stronger career pathways.\n\n\"If you're entering any industry, you need to know where you start, how you get trained, and what your progression looks like,\" he said.\n\n\"Training needs to be consistent across the country, because we're competing with industries that already have those systems in place.\"\n\nAlmost 80 per cent of Australia's freight is shifted through trucks according to aggregate data. (Supplied: Australia Post)\n\nThe other area of significant improvement was the recruitment of women, who make up only 6.4 per cent of drivers.\n\n\"We also need to address why women aren't entering the industry, \" Mr Clark said.\n\n\"There aren't enough facilities or rest stops \u2014 and that's not just an issue for women, it affects all road users.\n\n\"What we need is strong leadership from the top, real commitment, and genuine action, and that has to come from the highest levels of government.\"",

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nKhawaja scored centuries in India, England, Sri Lanka, the UAE and Pakistan, his country of birth, when Australia toured the nation for the first time in 24 years for three Tests in March 2022.\n\nThe past couple of years have been leaner for the former Sydneysider, with a historic double century in Galle in January his only century from his past 49 Test innings, averaging just 33.8 in that time.\n\nIn that time, Khawaja said some of the calls to retire felt like \"attacks\" from former players and the media, and said coach Andrew McDonald had asked him to stick around when he made clear he was willing to step aside during the 2024/25 summer.\n\n\"I felt people were coming for me, saying I was selfish for staying on, but I wasn't staying on for myself,\" he said.\n\n\"Andrew McDonald, not begged, but said: 'No, we want you to stay. We need you for Sri Lanka. I want you to stay on.' And so I did. It was never totally about me.\"\n\nStill, poor form and his age led to speculation of an impending retirement leading into the series and that was only fuelled when Khawaja was unable to open in either innings of the first Test of this summer's Ashes series due to back spasms, and missed the second Test due to the injury.\n\nHis international career looked over after being initially omitted from the squad for the third game in Adelaide before Smith's gameday withdrawal gave him a reprieve.\n\nPushed into the middle order for the first time in almost three years, Khawaja's 82 and 40 were enough to squeeze Josh Inglis out for the Boxing Day Test and set up his Sydney finale.\n\n\"As I walk off for the last time, I do so with gratitude and peace, or as we say 'salam,'\" he said.\n\n\"Grateful for the journey, the people, the lessons. Thank you for letting me live my dream and for sharing it with me.\"",

    "text": "Modular and prefabricated homes could be used for public housing in Canberra to help \"scale up\" the local home manufacturing industry.\n\nIt's just one method the ACT government is considering to meet its target of enabling 30,000 new homes in the territory by 2030.\n\nThe Master Builders Association has labelled the target \"a pipe dream\", but Planning Minister Chris Steel says they're doing all they can to achieve the goal, despite falling about 100 dwellings short of its first-year target of 4,200 new homes.\n\nThat's why modular and prefabricated housing and components are increasingly viewed as potential solutions to Australia's housing crisis.\n\nThey're built off-site in factories and then transported to their final location for assembly, and are often a cheaper and quicker housing option.\n\nBut those in the industry warn there needs to be substantial changes in planning, regulation and finance rules to make modular and prefabricated housing an affordable, scalable solution.\n\nManufactured houses 'the future of building'\n\nGeoff McGinley first looked into tiny homes to avoid the mortgage trap. (ABC News: Joel Wilson)\n\nGeoff McGinley's modular housing business began as a project to design and build his own home.\n\n\"I'd done 28 years in the Navy, and I was ready for the next dream, for the next passion to follow, and I needed an affordable housing solution,\" Mr McGinley said.\n\n\"I didn't want to get locked into the mortgage trap that I see, and so I thought, 'I'll go for a tiny house'.\"\n\nThough tiny houses are comparatively affordable and quick to move and set up, Mr McGinley wasn't happy with the size of the structures on offer.\n\n\"Tiny houses are, well, tiny, so \u2026 I went and found a really high-quality manufactured house,\" Mr McGinley said.\n\n\" And manufactured houses really are, I think, the future of building in Australia. \"\n\nThe biggest constraint Adapt Homes faces is the planning process, Geoff McGinley says. (ABC News: Joel Wilson)\n\nMr McGinley constructed what he says is like \"an extra-large tiny house on wheels\".\n\n\"I took this National Construction Code modular house, and we put it onto a commercial truck trailer \u2026 it legally meets the definition of a caravan,\" he explained.\n\n\"Having delivered my house and moved in, I sort of turned to my builder and said, 'Hey, we can't stop at one'.\n\n\"There is this housing crisis in Australia, and there's a lack of options.\n\n\"People are looking for different ways to solve their housing solutions, and they're getting locked into a smaller range.\n\n\"We wanted to give people options so that they had a housing solution when traditional ways of doing this didn't work.\"\n\nMr McGinley's company, Adapt Homes, now offers several moveable tiny houses, which range in size from 14 to 40 square metres, and can be joined together or stacked, like toy bricks, to make larger buildings.\n\nManufactured mostly in China, Mr McGinley argues the supply of these types of homes \u2014 which, once built, can be set up on a property in a matter of hours \u2014 could be easily scaled up to provide 1,000 a month.\n\n\"The biggest constraint is not our ability to manufacture the homes,\" Mr McGinley said.\n\n\"The biggest constraint is the planning process.\n\n\"Obviously, we want to ensure that these homes are fit for purpose and suit the environment.\n\n\"But our planning processes take a long time \u2014 a really, really long time \u2014 they can take three to four times the duration to build a house.\"\n\nMr McGinley said these factory-made homes could be used to provide crisis accommodation quickly and give more options to people for whom owning a home is currently out of reach.\n\n\"We see young families or old families, we see people escaping a crisis, we see people who are just trying to live life their way,\" he said.\n\n\" Let's accept that there is a path for long-term habitation in a tiny house on wheels. And let's see this as both an option, but also as our sort of go-to. Let's fix something. \"\n\nHigh demand for prefabricated options\n\nAndrew Copley says there needs to be a change in regulation regarding modular housing. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nAJC Modular chief executive Andrew Copley agrees that changes to regulation are needed in order to meet the housing demand in both the ACT and nationally.\n\nHis company's factory in Queanbeyan uses Australian-made structurally-insulated panels to build modular granny flats and homes.\n\nThe panels are an insulated foam core sandwiched between two structural facings \u2014 in AJC's case, gyprock.\n\n\"We use structurally insulated panels for a few reasons,\" Mr Copley said.\n\n\"The cost: because we can make them a lot quicker, they go together like Lego pieces; and the sustainability aspect \u2014 they're highly efficient for energy efficiency ratings.\"\n\nPrefab panels stacked up inside the modular housing factory in Queanbeyan. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nHe also said the panels are cut to size \u2014 so they involve minimal wastage.\n\n\"And even if we do have wastage, we've got specialised recycling bins here to make the best use of that waste, whereas at a [traditional house] job site, it just all gets dumped into one generic waste bin,\" he said.\n\nAn artist's impression of a modular home. (Supplied: AJC Modular )\n\nMr Copley said his company had seen so much demand that they're now setting up a second factory in Brisbane.\n\nBut he argues that design approval and certification processes stand in the way of building the number of homes needed to meet government housing targets.\n\n\"From the time it takes me to start a job and complete it, it's about 12 to 14 weeks,\" he said.\n\n\"However, getting it to that point where we're actually allowed to start it is the biggest hurdle.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what state it is; it's just a massive red tape on this product where it shouldn't be.\n\n\"These are all preset designs. They're pre-engineered. Everything is built exactly the same way every single time.\n\n\"But yet we still have these massive hurdles and massive roadblocks to get the product through.\"\n\nAn artist's impression of a modular home. (Supplied: AJC Modular )\n\nMr Copley thinks Australia could learn from the American industry.\n\n\"In America, they'll come and inspect your factory, they'll look over your building methods, they'll look at your engineered drawings,\" he said.\n\n\"And as long as you meet those set criteria and you tick all the boxes \u2014 like your setbacks are within the requirements, the house size is within the requirements \u2014 it's an automatic approval.\n\n\" We should have the same here. It's concerning that we're not at that stage yet. \"\n\nCalls for more investment and less red tape\n\nThe ACT is ahead of achieving the national housing target to build 1.2 million homes over 5 years, but still fell about 100 dwellings short of its first-year target of 4,200 new homes.\n\nAnna Neelagama is sceptical the territory will be able to build 30,000 homes by 2030. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nMaster Builders ACT chief executive Anna Neelagama is sceptical the target will be met in the territory.\n\n\"Master Builders ACT has labelled the 30,000 target a pipe dream,\" she said.\n\n\"Our data indicates we will need to build a whopping 4,700 homes each calendar year in order to make up that shortfall and achieve that goal by 2030.\n\n\"The industry is suffering from a stranglehold of red tape and regulation, and what we've said to the ACT government is that we need to give builders time and money back in order to get on with the job of building houses.\"\n\nAmong the things the industry group are asking for to meet the target is a faster planning system; investment in critical construction trades; and a hold on implementing changes from the National Construction Code 2022 (NCC 2022) \u2014 the primary framework of minimum standards for new buildings and building work, which is reviewed every three years.\n\nBut the peak body has welcomed the proposed Missing Middle changes to the ACT's planning system, and argues the inclusion of modern methods of construction \u2014 like the use of modular and prefabricated materials or buildings in their entirety \u2014 is necessary if demand for housing is to be met.\n\n\"They can reduce build times by up to 50 per cent, and they can also reduce the cost of a home end-to-end by about 20 per cent,\" Ms Neelagama said.\n\nHowever, she warned that modular housing \"absolutely\" should be built by a licensed builder, and raised several questions around compliance.\n\n\"In Australia, building a house is very highly regulated,\" Ms Neelagama said.\n\n\"The homeowner is represented by an independent certifier, and it's very heavily governed here in the ACT by the Construction Occupations Registrar.\n\n\"Modern methods of construction are obviously far less site-based, and there aren't those checks and balances available yet, in order to deliver the quality consumer outcomes.\n\n\"So, at what point do the certification and quality checks occur? Is it in the factory? Is it on site? Who are the people responsible for putting it all together?\n\n\"These questions remain unanswered by the ACT government.\"\n\nChris Steel says greater uptake of modular housing will require \"a whole change in thinking\". (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nACT government using prefabricated homes for public housing\n\nPlanning Minister Chris Steel said the government was indeed seeking answers on how to bring more modular and prefabricated homes into Canberra.\n\n\"The Commonwealth has put some money on the table to accelerate modern methods of construction, and so we'll work with them and try to use that funding to try and demonstrate this type of housing in the ACT through public housing,\" he said.\n\n\"Then that might enable the private sector to get on board.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Steel argued that the challenges of modular housing need to be met at multiple levels of government, and within industry.\n\n\"It requires a whole change in thinking,\" Mr Steel said.\n\n\"There is an opportunity through modern methods of construction to gain efficiencies and scale up production of new homes, and there is a considerable national effort that's required to support that at every different level.\n\n\"We're working with the Commonwealth on that, but we'll need to work with industry.\n\n\"We also need to look at [how] the planning and building system [support] this type of development when it is built on site, so they can gain the necessary approvals \u2014 potentially part of that in the factory, but then certainly once it's transported out on site and put in place.\"\n\nMr Steel said the government had been talking with banks and financial institutions about what they need to do to restructure loans to support this type of housing.\n\nHowever, he said one of the fundamental problems is the cost of transporting modular housing, which can be quite high if coming from interstate.\n\n\"But if we've got local suppliers, then there may be the opportunity through procurement standards that the ACT government might set for public housing, for example, to try and scale up the industry through government procurement,\" he said.\n\n\" That might also entice the private sector and mums and dads who want to build this housing \u2026 if we can show some great examples of it being used in public housing in the ACT. \"\n\nOne of the biggest costs for modular housing is transporting the structures into place. (ABC News: Joel Wilson)\n\nMissing middle focus remains\n\nMr Steel said the government's focus on providing housing for the missing middle remained sharp.\n\nMissing middle housing refers to terraces, townhouses, duplexes and low-rise apartment buildings, and the government wants them in areas currently zoned for standalone houses.\n\n\"One of the commitments that we made at the election was to deliver a pattern book for housing in the ACT,\" he said.\n\n\"This Canberra housing pattern book would be a set of pre-approved designs, which could then have an accelerated pathway through the planning system.\n\n\" We want to focus on missing middle housing and provide the opportunity for prefabricated or modular housing as part of the pattern book in Canberra. \"\n\nDespite the pessimism in the industry and concerns about delays in implementing the proposed missing middle changes, Mr Steel remains optimistic the government's housing target can be met through a combination of planning changes and land release.\n\n\"We're on track to meet the national housing target, and we are at the moment putting in place all of the regulatory changes, the zoning changes, to enable the 30,000 homes,\" Mr Steel said.\n\n\"We're confident at this stage that we've already pretty much met the target in year one, and we've got the future reforms currently before the Assembly, and more to come next year that will enable us to reach the target.\"",

    "text": "At 82, artist Pippin Drysdale brims with energy and humour.\n\nThe renowned Western Australian ceramic artist's major retrospective, Infinite Terrain, opened in December at the Art Gallery of Western Australia (AGWA), and its creation is due, in part, to a spirited encounter with Colin Walker, AGWA's director.\n\nThe two met at a private gallery opening several years ago but Drysdale had no idea who he was.\n\n\"He said 'oh do you go to the art gallery much?' and I said 'no, they don't give a rat's arse about me',\" she says.\n\n\"And then he wrote me a note saying 'oh, we'll have to change that' or something. Colin's never let me live that down.\"\n\nPippin Drysdale grew herbs and made paper flowers before turning to ceramics. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nThe subsequent exhibition has involved a mammoth effort by curator Isobel Wise, tracking down work from a prolific 40 years and bringing them together to tell the story of Drysdale's creative arc.\n\n\"Isobel has done an amazing job,\" she says.\n\n\"I was battling with her in the beginning and somehow, it's like the taming of the shrew \u2014 I'm not easy.\n\n\" She has pushed on and for me to have that privilege of suddenly feeling that my whole journey has come together; it's creating for me a wonderful sense of how much I've done. \"\n\nOne of Pippin Drysdale's early pieces, Irregular slab form, 1985. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\n'I just fell on my feet'\n\nDrysdale is the first to admit hers is has not been the career of a struggling artist.\n\nShe was born in Melbourne in 1943 and grew up in Perth, and, as a child she always loved art.\n\nShe had several enterprises before turning to ceramics, including growing herbs and making and selling paper flowers in Melbourne before the urge to go into pottery seized her in 1981.\n\nShe and a friend enrolled in a three-year diploma at what was then Perth Tech.\n\n\"Anyhow, well off we went on this three-year madness,\" she says of her TAFE course, which was followed by a decision to go to the US to study at Anderson Ranch, an arts centre in Colorado, which she funded by selling off work she'd made at Fremantle Arts Centre.\n\n\"I filled the car up, took them all down to the Freo arts centre to flog them came home with $5,500 cash and threw it on the floor and said 'I'm going to America'.\n\nA piece from Drysdale's Eastern Goldfields series III, made in 1998. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\n\"I went by Hawaii, had a wonderful little affair there then rushed off to America and then ended up in the Anderson Ranch with all such a diversity of cultures and we had the most amazing lecturers.\n\n\" I just fell on my feet everywhere I went, and then I finally came home from this amazing journey after nearly a year. \"\n\nAfter settling back into the cottage in Fremantle her father bought her, where she still lives and works, she went to Curtin University to complete a degree in Fine Arts.\n\n\"I then started at Curtin, had three extraordinary years there, and the rest is history,\" she says.\n\nA piece from Pippin Drysdale's 2017 Pilbara series III - Ominous clouds. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nInspired by travel\n\nIn the years after her studies, Drysdale embarked on a series of journeys that shaped her work. These included, in the early nineties, spending months in Italy at the Grazia Maioliche di Deruta factory before going onto the Siberian city of Tomsk for a residency at the university.\n\nShe recalled a hair-raising series of events involving a stolen handbag, a missing passport and arriving in the previously closed city shortly after Russia opened up to the outside world, along with visits to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\nA piece from Pippin Drysdale's Russian series - OTT, 1993. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\n\"It was like living in a Fellini movie \u2014 it was crazy stuff and we were the first English-speaking people to arrive in Tomsk and Tomsk had only been opened one week,\" she says.\n\n\"They'd send a bus and take us out to a dacha [summer house] where they'd make great big vats of wonderful chamomile tea where we sweated like crazy then they'd come in and whip you with birch leaves.\"\n\nThe result of everything she saw in Europe was what she came to call her OTT (over the top) series, using blacks and white and lustres of silver and gold in her work.\n\nShe then had another change of style in the late 1990s, with trips to remote parts of Western Australia and the Northern Territory.\n\n\" I was just blown away. I felt so humble at the age of 50 to go out and walk in gorges and camp in the Bungles and even took helicopters. \"\n\nThe result has been multiple series of work deeply infused with the landscapes she sees in her travels.\n\nDrysdale doesn't take photographs or sketches on her trips.\n\n\"I'm lousy, I just seem to absorb everything visually and emotionally really.\n\n\"I'm not one for writing, I think after Curtin University, having to have a stupid book and write down what you're thinking and doing, which I hated.\n\n\" I just experience it and then whatever comes, comes. \"\n\nThree pieces from Pippin Drysdale's 2006 series, Tanami traces series V. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nA pivotal collaboration\n\nSince 1992, Drysdale has worked with fellow potter Warrick Palmateer, who throws the exquisite porcelain vessels which are her canvas.\n\n\"He has been a pivotal part of my practice. I'm sure I would never have existed if I hadn't had Warrick in my life,\" she said.\n\nIt was Palmateer who sparked a major shift in Drysdale's work in 2016, encouraging her to look at the Karlu Karlu/The Devil's Marbles, a series of large, precariously balanced granite boulders in the Northern Territory, south of Tennant Creek.\n\nTwo sets from Drysdale's Breakaway series IV - Elephant Rocks (front) and Wolf Creek Crater (back), made in 2025. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nThat signalled a shift from symmetrical, open vessels to more organic, closed pieces that reflect the natural formations.\n\n\"Warrick was the one that said, 'let's look at the Devil's Marbles' and that was a big influence on me,\" she said.\n\n\" As much as I love the pure form, I was ready to create something more sculptural, and he was amazing. \"\n\nIt took a year of experimentation to produce the smooth, asymmetrical boulder forms without cracking.\n\nIt set Drysdale off on a new creative roll.\n\nThe resulting series now form superb landscapes in AGWA's first floor gallery, set on wide plinths that allow visitors to see the work without it being behind glass.\n\nWorks from Drysdale's 2024 Breakaway series III - The patterning of light: Swift parrot installation, a response to the plight of the critically endangered parrot. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nNever in the safe zone\n\nDrysdale's work is now sought after all around the world, including by a friend she refers to as Stoker Devonshire (real name Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire, who resides at Chatsworth House), who has amassed a substantial collection of Drysdale's work.\n\n\"He's been such a catalyst. They did become wonderful friends (and) I've been to stay there many times over the years,\" she said.\n\nAt 82, Drysdale has no plans to slow down. The backyard studio she has worked in for forty years is stocked with pure white porcelain vessels ready for the painstaking work of glazing, etching and sanding.\n\nAfter a short break in December, she will be back in the studio, preparing work for another show.\n\n\"I'll start working in January, I've got a lot of blanks down there that I need to work on.\"\n\nPippin Drysdale's Fremantle studio with pieces reading for etching and glazing. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nEach piece involves hours and days of work.\n\n\"There's so many parts to it and you can never rest on your laurel. You have a little run where it's fabulous then the kiln starts playing up and you just aren't getting the glazes to fuse.\n\n\" You're never in the safe zone, I can tell you, it's always a drama. \"\n\n\n\nBut she's under no illusions about how extraordinary her career has been.\n\n\"I have been born under a lucky star,\" she says.\n\n\"I've been so loved and somehow one door opens another shuts, and I've just had the most amazing journey of a lifetime really.\"\n\nPippin Drysdale: Infinite Terrain is at the Art Gallery of Western Australia until April 6, 2026.",

There'll be more details coming out as they come to hand but certainly in the last 24 hours some positive signs are the indications coming out of the various tests he's having.\"\n\nGilchrist said Martyn was a \"great friend \u2026 a fine player and a terrific fella\".\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nHe said people from all around the world had reached out to show their love, which was fitting considering Martyn's brilliance with the bat away from home, where he scored nine of his 13 Test centuries.\n\n\"A lot of his best cricket work was done overseas, which is often the greatest challenge, out of your own comfort zone,\" Gilchrist said.\n\n\"The respect with which opposition teams speak about him, his talent and his quality, that's where it rings true.\n\n\"Sometimes the Australian cricket audience might not fully appreciate Marto because a lot of his work was done in the late hours in Australia when everyone was asleep and we were playing on foreign shores.\"",

    "text": "Pamela Misius's 40,000 square metre property is among the largest in New South Wales, but the number of homes she has been allowed to build on it is one.\n\nMs Misius's daughter, son-in-law and their four children live with her in the Yarramundi home on the western outskirts of Greater Sydney.\n\n\"Haley and Phil [Walton] moved back to help me with my [late] husband when he had dementia,\" the 77-year-old said.\n\n\"Then they stayed on because I couldn't see [myself] living here on my own with just the upkeep of the property.\"\n\nPamela Misius's property is 40,000 square metres in semi-rural Yarramundi, west of Sydney. (ABC News)\n\nAs the growing family crowded the home, they decided to try to build a second house on the same land, just a few metres away.\n\n\"We could look after Pam as she got older, and in turn she could help us look after the kids,\" Mr Walton said.\n\nBut any plan would require the approval of Hawkesbury City Council.\n\nThe first application for a second home was shot down in January 2019, according to council documents.\n\nThen an application for a renovation was rejected in November 2021.\n\nMr Walton, a 40-year-old stonemason who owns a construction company, decided to carry out an illegal renovation of the home, before fighting the council in the Land and Environment Court.\n\n\"There is no merit or jurisdictional reason not to grant development consent,\" Commissioner Elizabeth Espinosa ruled.\n\nBut the process cost time, energy and money.\n\n\"We've spent $200,000 fighting this,\" Mr Walton said.\n\nPhil Walton is among the seven people who live in the Yarramundi house. (ABC News: Tony Ibrahim )\n\nA proposal to cut councils out of the picture\n\nThe days when a council decides if a second home or a granny flat is built on the state's largest properties could be numbered.\n\nA NSW parliamentary inquiry is investigating if it is worthwhile overriding council authority by creating a new provision under the state government's planning laws.\n\nThis blanket rule would only apply to properties larger than 20,200 square metres \u2014 the inquiry posits there's more than 240,000 in the state \u2014 that are zoned for rural (RU1 to RU6) or environmental (C3 and C4) use.\n\nJohn Ruddick is heading the public inquiry looking into the issue of secondary dwellings on rural land. (Supplied)\n\nThe change would make it easier for families to live next door, easing the cost of housing, aged care and child care, said John Ruddick, chair of the Select Committee on Rural Housing and Second Dwelling Reform.\n\n\"It's not gonna cost the government anything, and it's going to help with the housing crisis,\" the Libertarian Party member said.\n\n\" We have a lot of vacant space, but what we have is excessive red tape which is constraining property development. \"\n\nMulti-generational housing could be a solution to housing shortage Communal living was once common in regional Australia.\n\nThe parliamentary committee was formed with unanimous support in the Legislative Council, but the government is not bound to adopt its findings.\n\n\"The broad legislative reforms to secondary dwellings \u2026 have merit, but steps must be taken to ensure additional dwellings minimise adverse impacts,\" the NSW government stated in a submission.\n\nImpact on housing affordability\n\nBuilding a second home on an existing lot would remove one significant expense: the cost of land.\n\nMr Ruddick said the areas where most second dwellings would be built include the Hawkesbury, Orange, Bega and Port Macquarie, but there could be a boom in the Mid North Coast, Shoalhaven, Snowy Monaro and Tamworth.\n\n\"It used to be standard practice to leave home when you're a late teenager, early 20s,\" he said.\n\n\"It's now almost becoming a standard practice to delay that 10 years.\"\n\nNicole Gurran disagrees that building a second home will help housing affordability. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nBut a leading academic does not believe the policy is ambitious enough to result in a meaningful number of extra houses.\n\n\"This is not a measure that's going to address housing affordability,\" Nicole Gurran said, professor of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Sydney\n\n\" It's talking about simply making it easier to do something that you can already do. \"\n\nShe believes councils should keep their decision-making powers.\n\n\"It's almost impossible to have a blanket policy for developing on rural land. We'll have to deal with exceptions as they arise, which they will.\"\n\nRate reform will be needed, councils say\n\nCouncils believe it is critical that the plans of new buildings are individually assessed against their surroundings.\n\n\"There is broad agreement that any reforms need to allow councils to carefully tailor requirements to the local conditions,\" Local Government NSW (LGNSW) said in its submission.\n\nThe group advocating for councils says rates will need to be reformed if second homes are going to be built on large properties. (ABC News)\n\nThe group lists a variety of reasons, including some that boil down to funding and resources.\n\n\"These potentially thousands of additional properties will be unratable,\" the advocacy group said.\n\n\"Any additional rural secondary dwelling reform must occur in concert with rate reform that reflects the true cost of servicing properties with multiple dwellings, particularly in rural and farmland areas, and would help councils maintain financial viability.\"\n\nThis is because rates are calculated on the value of land, and not the buildings on them.\n\nPhilip Walton said he would be happy to pay 50 per cent more in rates if he could have a second home on the property.\n\nFrom farms to residential communities\n\nLGNSW warns the building of homes on farmland could lead to the zoning being changed in the future from agricultural to residential use.\n\nProfessor Gurran said the concern is credible.\n\n\"You want to avoid cutting up that rural land, you know, by stealth or in an unplanned way,\" she said.\n\n\"Once you change a land used from being primarily agricultural and shift it towards being more residential, then the future of that land starts to get locked in place.\"\n\nThere are concerns that building second homes on farmland could see them changed in the future to residential. (ABC News)\n\nBut the NSW Farmers Association claims the lack of housing is limiting agricultural productivity.\n\n\"Farmers struggle to house workers, families face difficulties planning for succession and essential workers like teachers, nurses and police find they have nowhere to live in our communities,\" vice-president Rebecca Reardon told the inquiry.\n\nShe said some farmers are told they can build a second home, but only if an existing structure is knocked down and replaced, preventing it from being used for another purpose.\n\n\"If we do not have accommodation, very simply put, we cannot get workers.\n\n\"We want to be able to say we might need a second dwelling, even a third dwelling.\"\n\nThe inquiry's report is due in February next year.",

    "text": "But he was dropped and recalled so many times that Khawaja was left to conclude that he did not fit the mould. There were axings in 2011 (twice), 2013 (plus a homework suspension in India), 2016, 2017 (twice), 2019 and then finally, for a day in Adelaide this series. As often happens, recalls came as a result of others\u2019 misfortune - Travis Head\u2019s positive COVID Test in 2022, for example, when Khawaja marked his return with back-to-back hundreds at the SCG. Khawaja embraces his father, Tariq. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI\u2019ve broken down so many barriers, I\u2019ve had to fight so many battles,\u201d he says. \u201cI got dropped a lot early on because I was different, I didn\u2019t really fit into the mould, the 50/50 calls went against me. I\u2019ve no doubt of that. \u201cI don\u2019t say this with any prejudice because I loved my journey, I\u2019m very grateful for where I am right now, but if my name was John Smith I would\u2019ve got away with a bit more if I\u2019m totally honest. But I wasn\u2019t and I was trying to break that down.\u201d\n\nLoading As a committed Muslim, Khawaja looks upon his subsequent recall to finish the series as somewhat providential. It had arrived after he made his peace with God that if Perth was to prove his final Test match, he was grateful nonetheless. \u201cIt has to be, right? I know people don\u2019t believe in God, but I believe God does everything, the good and the bad,\u201d Khawaja says. \u201cI pray five times a day every day and have a very close connection with God personally, and for me it wasn\u2019t like \u2018please God let me play again, let me finish my career like this\u2019, it was, \u2018thank you for everything you\u2019ve given me, I\u2019m very grateful and happy to go out now\u2019. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to play again and once I didn\u2019t play in Adelaide I thought it\u2019s going to be hard for me to play unless something goes awry, which it did. But the odds of that happening are low, batsmen don\u2019t miss a lot of Test matches. So I was very comfortable. I was in my gratitude state, which I have been for a long time, saying thank you for all the Test matches I\u2019ve played, been able to do a lot of great stuff both inside and outside of cricket. \u201cI was really just happy to help the team out if they needed me. I never wanted to be a guy who left a series halfway through. No offence to anyone who has, everyone has the right to leave whenever they want, but I tried to avoid that because I knew if something happened to one of the batsmen the series was still alive. So I said I\u2019m happy to be 12th man until the end of the series if that\u2019s the case and I\u2019ll just retire in Sydney.\u201d\n\nOver these past few weeks there has been much said about \u201cfarewell\u201d matches or series, and whether Khawaja deserves one. It has rankled him, especially given that internal discussions have been more about getting him to play one more India tour in 2027 rather than pushing him to the exit. There is something poetic about how Khawaja will finish his Test career having played two distinct halves. Forty-four Tests between 2011 and 2019 when he was in and out of the side, then another 44 Tests over the past four years where he has been a trusted and ever-present member of the team. Khawaja announces his retirement. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer \u201cIt really annoyed me that everyone was talking about the farewell tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about that. It wasn\u2019t a case of finishing at the SCG, it was a case of finishing the series and if that\u2019s the last one it\u2019s the last one. To be honest it\u2019s been more so that Andrew McDonald has kept pushing me, too. I could\u2019ve left last summer. Even this year when I haven\u2019t had a great year by my standards, I was still wanted. \u201cThis whole period was always a bonus for me, and I think it\u2019s helped me to play. It took a little bit of stress and pressure off me. I was never holding on, I was always ready to go. Whenever I felt like it was time to go, I was ready to go. Even right until the very end when I spoke to Andrew, he was laughing and going \u2018how can we get you to India, what do we need to do?\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was nice to think if I said I was staying on this wasn\u2019t my last match. Pretty positive I would\u2019ve played the next series and gone to South Africa. You obviously need to score runs to be in the team, but it wasn\u2019t a case that I was getting dropped. I\u2019m happy and content that I was still in the team and I\u2019ve left on my own terms rather than being pushed out.\u201d Providence or not, there will also be something entirely fitting about Khawaja\u2019s final Test match taking place at the SCG. The SCG and the suburbs around it were where Khawaja spent his first few summers in Australia between 1991 and 1995, sparking the love of cricket that still burns brightly whenever he speaks about it. \u201cThe SCG was 10 minutes down the road. I was in absolute awe of the NSW guys. I used to watch Richard Chee Quee when I was younger, not knowing I\u2019d get to play with him one day in grade cricket,\u201d Khawaja says. \u201cHe helped me a lot through those early years of grade cricket and learning how to play with men, when I was just coming in as a 16-year-old, learning the art and getting absolutely nailed by everyone, especially as a little brown kid trying to play a very white game in Sydney.\u201c\n\nMoney was tight in the Khawaja household. To get a glimpse of international cricket up close, the family would wait until the closing overs of a match, when attendants would open the public gates for early departures, to sneak in for the end of day/night games. Khawaja remains conscious of the cost of playing the game for immigrant and working-class families. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford tickets. My Mum said tickets were about $30 each back then, and that was way too much for us. So we\u2019d wait right until the end of a one-dayer, they\u2019d open the gates and I\u2019d get to see the last five overs or so. We\u2019d run in and watch the last little bit of cricket and that\u2019s all I got. Back then if the game wasn\u2019t sold out on TV they wouldn\u2019t even show it, so I\u2019d be 10 minutes away from the SCG listening to it on the radio. I\u2019ve never lost those memories. \u201cI watched my first game of cricket in the old Doug Walters Stand, it was disgusting, but luckily with my skin colour I could get away with it in the sun. But we were watching Dean Jones and Mark Waugh batting and my brother would go \u2018watch these guys, they\u2019re the best runners between the wickets ever\u2019 and the aura of the Australian team. \u201cThen to be able to play there, debut there for NSW, debut there for Australia, make my comeback there, in 2022 and hopefully finish there, So much emotion goes into that ground for me, because I grew up literally next to it. It\u2019s a very special place.\u201d\n\nKhawaja celebrating the first of two centuries on his return to the Test side at the SCG in 2022 against England. Credit: Getty Images Khawaja will finish in esteemed company among Australian top order players. He\u2019s currently 29 runs short of the runs tallied by Mike Hussey, and has more hundreds than the likes of Doug Walters, Ian Chappell or Bill Lawry. But his defining achievement, more than any runs, centuries or victories, will be in showing it is possible for a south Asian Australian to play the game at the highest level for a long time. In his own, wise-cracking way, Khawaja is to Australian cricket what Jim Brown was to American football or Jackie Robinson to baseball: pathfinders. \u201cThere was a wide narrative among the multicultural community that we can\u2019t represent Australia in cricket, they don\u2019t pick our kind,\u201d he says. \u201cAll those narratives that we\u2019re lazy, we\u2019re selfish, we don\u2019t care about the team, we don\u2019t mingle well. All these false racial stereotypes I had to try to break down throughout my career, even up until now. \u201cThe journey\u2019s been so much tougher but I\u2019m so grateful I got to do it because I\u2019ve been able to show people of all backgrounds, it doesn\u2019t matter what ethnicity, what colour or what faith you have, you can play for Australia. You might have to be a little more resilient than the guy next to you, you have to go in there with an open mind and understand that.\n\n\u201cYour journey might not be as easy, but hopefully now I\u2019ve done this journey and been very successful, hopefully the next person will have an easier journey. Then the next person after that will have an easier journey. Then hopefully at some point they\u2019ll have the same journey. That\u2019s the ultimate goal. Seeing is believing, and they\u2019ve seen it now.\u201d This is not to say that the job is done. Far from it. In the weeks and months after his final Test match, Khawaja will play plenty of golf, spend plenty more time with his young and growing family, and do the odd bit of commentary. But he will also work assiduously at trying to keep that pathway open. Loading \u201cI didn\u2019t like the Australian cricket team growing up because I didn\u2019t see myself in the team,\u201d Khawaja says. \u201cI supported the Windies or Pakistan, pretty much anyone but Australia, until the age of 13 when Gilly and Brett Lee won me over with the way they played the game. I decided \u2018I love these guys\u2019. They didn\u2019t seem like that older generation.\u201d",

    "text": "Unconventional Venues Loni Peterson, the owner of LP Creative Events in Denver, says wedding venues will continue to be more surprising with spaces such as historic ruins, caves and airport hangars. \u201cCouples want their special day to stand out among the noise and one way they can do that is by hosting their guests at a \u2018non wedding\u2019 venue,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are also having couples holding their events in open fields, fairgrounds and ski and snowboard trails.\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Jodie Haydon were among those who married at non wedding venues in 2025 when they tied the knot at The Lodge. They also wrote their own vows. Credit: Mike Bowers\n\nMultiple Celebrations Xin Huang, a wedding planner and the owner of Le Petite Priv\u00e9 in New York, says she is seeing many couples host celebrations spread out over months \u2013 whether with a cultural ceremony or a reception months before or after the legal marriage, or separate receptions months apart. Couples are also celebrating across cities or countries that have meaning to them or where their loved ones live. \u201cThis is a beautiful way to parade your love and share what is important to you in the different settings and cultures that speak to you,\u201d Huang says. Projected Videos \u201cWith draping and white colour schemes being two huge decor trends in 2025, there has been a natural progression with the use of projection,\u201d says Jessica Ralph, the owner and executive planner of Parties A La Carte in Tampa Bay, Florida.\n\nLoading \u201cDraped, sheer white overlay creates an effective backdrop for projection and an elevated, romantic setting.\u201d (Videos can be displayed on a blank wall, with rear projection used to ensure a seamless set-up.) Some couples are also using a mix of photos from their relationship, while others are focusing on engagement session images, says Masha Sakhno, the founder of Masha Sakhno Photo in Honolulu. In addition to sharing their love story, couples are also displaying images of family members. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to add sentiment and nostalgia to the celebration,\u201d she says. Memorable Entertainment Wedding attendees can expect to be entertained more. Couples are welcoming guests with musicians and dancers, blending DJs with live bands (or saxophones), and introducing unexpected performances during cocktail hour. Many are also adding activities that engage other senses, such as coffee stations, gelato carts or custom fragrance bars.\n\nLoading \u201cCouples are seeking those surprise-and-delight moments that make guests feel part of something personal and alive,\u201d says Fallon Carter, an event planner and the founder of Fallon Carter Events in Washington, DC. Love Notes Pinterest\u2019s 2026 trends predictions anticipate a resurgence in personalised notes and letters. Peterson says more of her clients were incorporating notes to their guests in their reception decor. \u201cI\u2019m seeing them find unique ways to connect with each guest,\u201d she says, \u201cwhether thanking them for travelling to celebrate their marriage, including an inside joke or introducing them to the person sitting next to them at their table.\u201d Heidi Moore, a stationer and the owner of Idieh Design, based in Phoenix, has also noticed that many of her clients are choosing to leave individualised notes.\n\n\u201cSome craft one message per couple, while others write a unique note for each person,\u201d she says. Sometimes handwriting is replaced with handwritten-style fonts to save time. Dessert Cocktails Couples will be incorporating signature dessert cocktails during the cake cutting to elevate the moment, says Koby Morris, the owner of Southern Standard, an events bar services company based in New Braunfels, Texas. Decadent, fruity mocktails and espresso martinis are favourites that will be also trending in 2026. Curated Food There is an increasing focus on food as part of the overall design, rather than simply sustenance, says Alice Wilkes, a wedding planner and the founder of Alice Wilkes Design in London.\n\n\u201cPlanners are seeing a growing interest in the presentation of food itself, with beautifully styled dishes, canapes and drinks becoming an extension of the event\u2019s aesthetic and storytelling,\u201d she says. \u201cCouples are embracing elevated dessert rooms, tasting stations and interactive chef-led moments.\u201d It\u2019s no longer a case of chicken or beef at weddings with more emphasis on presentation and curated menus. Deborah Miller, the founder of Deborah Miller Catering & Events in New York, is seeing more couples opt for cocktail-style wedding receptions, with food stations, passed canapes and small plates over more traditional plated dinners. \u201cThis allows for a lot more culinary creativity,\u201d Miller says.\n\nBold Colours and Stripes Pinterest\u2019s 2026 trends report also predicts that vivid colours and stripes will inspire decor choices, which event planners forecast will influence weddings. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing couples choosing to make a statement with saturated colours,\u201d says Dawn Crothers, the president and creative director of Something Vintage Rentals, based in Temple Hills, Maryland. \u201cHues like red, teal, burgundy and deep green will be strong for 2026.\u201d \u201cFull-colour tablescapes, mixed-hue glassware, layered colourful florals and vivid linens will be popular for creating immersive, theatrical environments,\u201d says Sarah Farsh, an owner and the creative director of Olympic Valley Stables, an event venue in Olympic Valley, California, and an owner of Tahoe Engaged, a wedding vendor directory. Bridal Party Outfit Changes Second looks are no longer just for the bride and groom. Patricia Voto, a New York-based designer and the founder of One Of, recently created three looks for a mother of the bride, who changed from ceremony to reception to after-party.",

    "text": "Platinum, used in high-end jewellery, benefited from the lift in gold. At half the price of its shiny precious metal counterpart, platinum is relatively cheap for jewellers. It is also a metal important to vehicle production, both internal combustion and electric. Throw in the Trump turmoil and a global shortage (due to a fall in the world\u2019s largest producer nation, South Africa) and you set the stage for one of the most unexpected increases in value for a precious metal this year. But crypto became even more cryptic\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s election was a very different story for another, much more volatile, investment class. Backers of cryptocurrencies believed the new president would drive prices up. There was speculation that Bitcoin \u2013 then trading at about $US100,000 \u2013 would move through the $US150,000 mark. But Bitcoin finishes the year around the $US87,000 mark, having tumbled from its October peak of $US124,700. It\u2019s not just Bitcoin that has suffered as investors have shunned more colourful investment opportunities due to concerns over American inflation. By some estimates, more than $US1 trillion in value was wiped from cryptocurrencies through the final three months of 2025.\n\nThe inopportune trade surplus with the United States Australia produces very little platinum. But it is one of the world\u2019s biggest gold producers. The big lift in gold prices did something that had not happened since Harry Truman was in the White House \u2013 deliver Australia a trade surplus with the United States. In January, February, March and then in July, gold was a key factor in Australia selling more goods and services to the US than buying them.\n\nWith Donald Trump attacking any nation that ran a trade surplus with the US (the penguins and seals of Heard and McDonald Islands at one point faced an American tariff hit), it could not have come at a worse time. It hasn\u2019t been helped by the drop-off in American tourism to Australia. There were almost 100,000 fewer visitors from the US over the past 12 months compared with the same period ahead of COVID. American tourists aren\u2019t getting as much value for their greenback, either. A big global story has been the drop in the value of the United States dollar. The Australian dollar appreciated by 8 per cent against its US counterpart.\n\nThat might make it more enticing for prospective Australian tourists to check out Trump\u2019s America \u2013 as long as they\u2019re ready to hand over all their social media history. The taxman cometh Even Jim Chalmers could not believe the position Peter Dutton took ahead of the 2025 election. The Coalition went to voters opposed to Labor\u2019s modest personal income tax cuts that start flowing from July 1 this year. Loading The tax cuts, which will be delivered over two years, were the one big surprise out of Chalmers\u2019 March budget. Even more surprising was the Coalition\u2019s opposition.\n\nThe budget is increasingly reliant on personal income tax collections. A combination of bracket creep, a strong jobs market and a tax system that gives more concessions to wealth and assets (particularly those held by older Australians) means the tax burden on ordinary workers is growing. The mid-year budget update revealed that of all income taxes collected by the government \u2013 personal, company, superannuation, petroleum and fringe benefits \u2013 the share coming from workers is on track to hit 69 per cent by 2028-29. Cost-of-living crisis? Try 1692 per cent inflation The re-emergence of inflation pressures, both in Australia and around the world, caught pundits and central banks off guard.\n\nDomestically, trying to track accurately price pressures across the economy was made more difficult by government energy subsidies. Headline inflation, which had peaked at 7.8 per cent in late 2022, tumbled to 1.9 per cent by the middle of this year. But then came the end of various state and federal electricity subsidies. While the federal government\u2019s $75-a-quarter subsidy finally ended with the calendar year, the biggest impact occurred in Brisbane where the former Miles government\u2019s $1000 came to an end in June. That led to electricity inflation in Brisbane jumping by a mind-boggling 1692.5 per cent in July. A year earlier, it had been minus 93 per cent. By year\u2019s end, Brisbane\u2019s overall inflation rate was a nation-leading 5.2 per cent.\n\nWhile electricity prices have been upended by government action, coffee prices have soared due to international factors. A global supply shortage due to poor weather in key growing areas has meant that anyone with a coffee (or chocolate) addiction has had to pay through the nose for their daily caffeine hit. The single largest weekly purchase by Australian households is the fuel for their cars. During 2025, Peter Dutton spent much of the election campaign visiting service stations and promising that a Coalition government would halve the fuel excise for 12 months. But petrol prices were relatively stable. Even as Dutton was manhandling bowsers everywhere he went, petrol was actually cheaper than it had been a year earlier.\n\nThe Uncertainty Index If you were confused by the economic events of the year, spare a thought for the Reserve Bank. It started the year with its first interest rate cut since the start of the COVID pandemic amid signs that inflation was easing. Despite three rate cuts, the bank finished the year with financial markets tipping it would start lifting interest rates in February.\n\nLoading In a sign of the economic rollercoaster faced by the bank, following Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs, it actually discussed a half percentage point rate cut to offset a global downturn. Every three months, the bank issues its \u201cstatement on monetary policy\u201d, which contains key forecasts as well as a general discussion of the economy\u2019s outlook. It was in the May iteration of that statement that the bank\u2019s confusion \u2013 shared by the rest of the world \u2013 became clear. That one statement used the term \u201cuncertain\u201d on 132 occasions.\n\nNever before had the bank been so unsure of the future. A growing population \u2013 but more slowly One of the most politically charged debates of the year has been population growth or, more specifically, net overseas migration. Australia has increasingly relied on migrants to grow the population, fill specialised and non-skilled jobs while international students had become the cash cows of the nation\u2019s universities. But the post-COVID surge in migration, on top of a lift in house prices (which picked up as soon as the Reserve Bank started cutting interest rates), combined to give the debate over immigration a sharp political edge through 2025.\n\nSince the international border was reopened in early 2022, net overseas migration has added almost 1.5 million residents to the country. Some of the surge was due to the two-year closure of the international border. In particular, students who had not been able to get into the country flooded back (and provided much-needed staff to the nation\u2019s cafes and restaurants). That pushed net overseas migration to a record 555,000 in late 2023. It has eased since then, so much so that the government\u2019s own budget estimates for the 2024-25 overestimated net overseas migration by 30,000.",

    "text": "Veteran Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja has announced his retirement from international cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"God, through cricket, has given me far more than I ever imagined,\" he told reporters at a press conference at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Friday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's given me memories I'll carry forever, friendships that go well beyond the game, and lessons that shaped me, who I am off the field.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja said the fifth Ashes Test of the series at the SCG \u2014 where he made his debut in 2011 \u2014 will be his last.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis announcement followed months of speculation about his future. He was unable to open in the first Ashes Test in Perth in November due to back spasms and then missed the Brisbane Test last month with the injury.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference at which he announced his retirement, Usman Khawaja also told reporters that he'd been subjected to double standards after speaking about political issues in recent years. Source: AAP / Robbie Stephenson / PA Wire At age 39, he will become Australia's oldest Test player in 40 years at the SCG on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe will finish with 88 Tests to his name, having already risen to be Australia's 15th greatest run-scorer in history with 6,206.\n\n\n\nKhawaja criticises double standards in cricket\n\nOn-field accomplishments aside, Khawaja has been widely regarded as a trailblazer in Australian sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first Muslim to play Test cricket for Australia, he's been a prominent advocate for inclusion and representation, speaking openly about faith, racism and belonging at the elite level.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja has also used his profile to advocate for humanitarian causes, and he has been a vocal supporter of the people of Gaza during Israel's post-October-7 military campaign in the enclave.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Aid agencies in Gaza condemn Israel's suspension of their licences to operate SBS News 03:07 English\n\nHe used Friday's announcement as a chance to highlight issues that still exist within the game, beginning with coverage of his back spasms this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja was heavily criticised in some quarters for playing golf in the lead up to the Perth Test, before the spasms forced him from the field and then ruled him out of Brisbane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I could have copped it for two days, but I copped it for five days straight,\" Khawaja said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't even about my performances, it was about something very personal. It was about my preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The way that everyone came at me about my preparation was quite personal in terms of things like 'he's not committed to the team, he was only worried about himself, he played this golf comp the day before, he's selfish, he doesn't train hard enough, he's lazy'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are the same racial stereotypes that I've grown up with my whole life.\"\n\n\n\nKhawaja said the comments from former players and those in the media were at odds with the way other injuries were spoken about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can give you countless number of guys who have played golf the day before a match and have been injured, but you guys haven't said a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can give you even more examples of guys who have had 15 schooners the night before a game and have then been injured, but no-one said a word because they were just being Aussie larrikins, they were just being lads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But when I get injured, everyone went at my credibility and who I am as a person.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja believed part of that commentary came down to the fact he had been outspoken on political issues in recent years, and the most notably the plight of Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\"I kind of know why I get nailed a lot of the time, particularly over the last two years,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I understand that I've talked about certain issues outside cricket which leaves me exposed and a lot of people don't like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I still find it hard when I say that everyone deserves freedom and that Palestinians deserve freedom and equal rights, and why that's a big issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I get it because I put myself out there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even when we get to Australian politics and we get all these right-wing politicians that are anti-immigration and (fuel) Islamophobia and I speak up against them, I know that people don't love that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I feel like I have to because where these guys are trying to divide and create hate and trying to create animosity in the Australian community, I'm doing the exact opposite.\"\n\n\n\nSCG fitting location for Khawaja's farewell\n\nHis decision to walk away also means the Sydney Test will also turn into something of a farewell party, with the series decided and Australia 3-1 up.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney will be a fitting location for his final Test, given so much of his career has been based around the city he moved to as a four-year-old from Islamabad, Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis 2011 debut against England, in which he scored 37 runs, offered Australian fans hope at the end of the worst home summer this century.\n\n\n\nUsman Khawaja with his wife Rachel and children Aisha and Ayla at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where Khawaja will soon play his final Test match.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more than a decade, Melbourne-based social enterprise, Sisterworks, has been helping migrant and refugee women enter the workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're in a real interview, you're looking at the person ,you're looking at their eyes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining courses focus on customer service, hospitality and people skills, as well as networking, resume writing and interviewing to ensure the women are 'job ready'.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ifrin Fittock, Sisterworks CEO, says late last year, a group of nine graduates found themselves in a situation neither they or their teachers had prepared for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We actually got caught on surprise when towards the end of last year we sent about nine sisters to an interview and they didn't make it, they didn't pass the interview. Upon investigation, we found out that they're actually not being interviewed face to face, but actually being interviewed by videos slash AI interviews and because they've never been exposed to it before, I think they just failed because they don't know what to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir experience is not unique, with job seekers increasingly sharing their own experiences with so-called \"robo\" interviews on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAN: \"Hello.\"\n\n\n\nROBOT: \"Hi, thank you so much for joining the interview today. I'm so excited to talk to you and get to know more about you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Robo\" interviews are when a candidate is interviewed by an AI system rather than a human.\n\n\n\n\n\nFittock says this style of interview can add extra barriers for migrant and refugee applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenges with these AI recruitment or AI interview for some of our sisters is really, first of all, English is not their first language, but also the level of digital literacy that they may or may not have because they need to actually navigate through, apart from answering questions, they also need to navigate that click of a button and pay attention to the timer and all that pressure really mounting up, especially when you see the ticking clock running in front of you. So it's all really quite confronting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, 43 percent of organisations use AI \"moderately\" in their recruitment, while 19 per cent use the technology \"extensively\" when hiring new staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's according to The Australian Responsible AI report, which details how Australian businesses are tracking when it comes to AI practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs employers increasingly embrace AI, video interview training is now part of the Sisterworks job course.\n\n\n\n\n\nFatemeh Hazrati - orginally from Iran - is among those currently taking part in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AI has real big effect on our life nowadays. All of us have to learn it, [and] [We] just need to adapt ourself for new things and accept challenges to learn new things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAI in recruitment is often touted for its ability to save both time and money.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there are mounting concerns around its potential to discriminate.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Natalie Sheard is from the Melbourne Law School at the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe led a study published earlier this month [[May 14]] that suggests AI hiring systems are creating new barriers to employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it could be older applicants, women, people who speak English as a second language, job seekers with disabilities. In my research I heard of systems not being accessible to job seekers with disabilities. I heard of CV screening systems using things like gaps in employment history to screen candidates out and having a gap in your employment history is a well-known proxy for gender as women tend to have time out of the workforce to care for family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also explains how those with English as a second language can be disadvantaged in video interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Another concern is that the way these systems tend to operate is the AI doesn't assess the video. What happens is the audio from your video is transcribed and then AI is used to evaluate your answer and it's well established that those transcription services perform poorly for people who speak English as a second language or have accents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMonash University's Professor Andreas Leibbrandt has also researched the role of AI in recruitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there are benefits to the technology, and if deployed correctly, a system can be less bias than a human.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one study, conducted in the US, he found women and non-anglo candidates are more likely to apply for a job if they know AI tools are being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not that both women or ethnic minorities feel there's no bias in the AI algorithm, but they feel that this bias is less so than when they're faced with a human recruiter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he's concerned by a lack of transparency, regulation and potential bias built into algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These AI algorithm are fed with training data sets or data sets from corporations. But their training data in itself may be biased. It may come from an organisation where there was, for instance, bias against women.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue around data sets and algorithms also emerged in Doctor Sheard's research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So one example there is a lot of these systems are built overseas, so they might've been trained on data on populations that aren't comparable to the Australian population. And therefore again, the system won't perform as well for particular demographic groups that we have in Australia. For example, refugees, migrant women, first Nations, Australians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are growing calls for the Australian government to better regulate the use of AI in recruitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Hunter is the CEO of Diversity Council Australia - the independent not-for-profit peak body leading diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With such high adoption rates and the rapid acceleration of the technology, we're just concerned that people aren't putting in place the proper considerations around ethical use.\"\n\n\n\n",

It had arrived after he made his peace with God that if Perth was to prove his final Test match, he was grateful nonetheless. \u201cIt has to be, right? I know people don\u2019t believe in God, but I believe God does everything, the good and the bad,\u201d Khawaja says. \u201cI pray five times a day every day and have a very close connection with God personally, and for me it wasn\u2019t like \u2018please God let me play again, let me finish my career like this\u2019, it was, \u2018thank you for everything you\u2019ve given me, I\u2019m very grateful and happy to go out now\u2019. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to play again and once I didn\u2019t play in Adelaide I thought it\u2019s going to be hard for me to play unless something goes awry, which it did. But the odds of that happening are low, batsmen don\u2019t miss a lot of Test matches. So I was very comfortable. I was in my gratitude state, which I have been for a long time, saying thank you for all the Test matches I\u2019ve played, been able to do a lot of great stuff both inside and outside of cricket. \u201cI was really just happy to help the team out if they needed me. I never wanted to be a guy who left a series halfway through. No offence to anyone who has, everyone has the right to leave whenever they want, but I tried to avoid that because I knew if something happened to one of the batsmen the series was still alive. So I said I\u2019m happy to be 12th man until the end of the series if that\u2019s the case and I\u2019ll just retire in Sydney.\u201d\n\nOver these past few weeks there has been much said about \u201cfarewell\u201d matches or series, and whether Khawaja deserves one. It has rankled him, especially given that internal discussions have been more about getting him to play one more India tour in 2027 rather than pushing him to the exit. There is something poetic about how Khawaja will finish his Test career having played two distinct halves. Forty-four Tests between 2011 and 2019 when he was in and out of the side, then another 44 Tests over the past four years where he has been a trusted and ever-present member of the team. Khawaja announces his retirement. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer \u201cIt really annoyed me that everyone was talking about the farewell tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about that. It wasn\u2019t a case of finishing at the SCG, it was a case of finishing the series and if that\u2019s the last one it\u2019s the last one. To be honest it\u2019s been more so that Andrew McDonald has kept pushing me, too. I could\u2019ve left last summer. Even this year when I haven\u2019t had a great year by my standards, I was still wanted. \u201cThis whole period was always a bonus for me, and I think it\u2019s helped me to play. It took a little bit of stress and pressure off me. I was never holding on, I was always ready to go. Whenever I felt like it was time to go, I was ready to go. Even right until the very end when I spoke to Andrew, he was laughing and going \u2018how can we get you to India, what do we need to do?\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was nice to think if I said I was staying on this wasn\u2019t my last match. Pretty positive I would\u2019ve played the next series and gone to South Africa. You obviously need to score runs to be in the team, but it wasn\u2019t a case that I was getting dropped. I\u2019m happy and content that I was still in the team and I\u2019ve left on my own terms rather than being pushed out.\u201d Providence or not, there will also be something entirely fitting about Khawaja\u2019s final Test match taking place at the SCG. The SCG and the suburbs around it were where Khawaja spent his first few summers in Australia between 1991 and 1995, sparking the love of cricket that still burns brightly whenever he speaks about it. \u201cThe SCG was 10 minutes down the road. I was in absolute awe of the NSW guys. I used to watch Richard Chee Quee when I was younger, not knowing I\u2019d get to play with him one day in grade cricket,\u201d Khawaja says. \u201cHe helped me a lot through those early years of grade cricket and learning how to play with men, when I was just coming in as a 16-year-old, learning the art and getting absolutely nailed by everyone, especially as a little brown kid trying to play a very white game in Sydney.\u201c\n\nMoney was tight in the Khawaja household. To get a glimpse of international cricket up close, the family would wait until the closing overs of a match, when attendants would open the public gates for early departures, to sneak in for the end of day/night games. Khawaja remains conscious of the cost of playing the game for immigrant and working-class families. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford tickets. My Mum said tickets were about $30 each back then, and that was way too much for us. So we\u2019d wait right until the end of a one-dayer, they\u2019d open the gates and I\u2019d get to see the last five overs or so. We\u2019d run in and watch the last little bit of cricket and that\u2019s all I got. Back then if the game wasn\u2019t sold out on TV they wouldn\u2019t even show it, so I\u2019d be 10 minutes away from the SCG listening to it on the radio. I\u2019ve never lost those memories. \u201cI watched my first game of cricket in the old Doug Walters Stand, it was disgusting, but luckily with my skin colour I could get away with it in the sun. But we were watching Dean Jones and Mark Waugh batting and my brother would go \u2018watch these guys, they\u2019re the best runners between the wickets ever\u2019 and the aura of the Australian team. \u201cThen to be able to play there, debut there for NSW, debut there for Australia, make my comeback there, in 2022 and hopefully finish there, So much emotion goes into that ground for me, because I grew up literally next to it. It\u2019s a very special place.\u201d\n\nKhawaja celebrating the first of two centuries on his return to the Test side at the SCG in 2022 against England. Credit: Getty Images Khawaja will finish in esteemed company among Australian top order players. He\u2019s currently 29 runs short of the runs tallied by Mike Hussey, and has more hundreds than the likes of Doug Walters, Ian Chappell or Bill Lawry. But his defining achievement, more than any runs, centuries or victories, will be in showing it is possible for a south Asian Australian to play the game at the highest level for a long time. In his own, wise-cracking way, Khawaja is to Australian cricket what Jim Brown was to American football or Jackie Robinson to baseball: pathfinders. \u201cThere was a wide narrative among the multicultural community that we can\u2019t represent Australia in cricket, they don\u2019t pick our kind,\u201d he says. \u201cAll those narratives that we\u2019re lazy, we\u2019re selfish, we don\u2019t care about the team, we don\u2019t mingle well. All these false racial stereotypes I had to try to break down throughout my career, even up until now. \u201cThe journey\u2019s been so much tougher but I\u2019m so grateful I got to do it because I\u2019ve been able to show people of all backgrounds, it doesn\u2019t matter what ethnicity, what colour or what faith you have, you can play for Australia. You might have to be a little more resilient than the guy next to you, you have to go in there with an open mind and understand that.\n\n\u201cYour journey might not be as easy, but hopefully now I\u2019ve done this journey and been very successful, hopefully the next person will have an easier journey. Then the next person after that will have an easier journey. Then hopefully at some point they\u2019ll have the same journey. That\u2019s the ultimate goal. Seeing is believing, and they\u2019ve seen it now.\u201d This is not to say that the job is done. Far from it. In the weeks and months after his final Test match, Khawaja will play plenty of golf, spend plenty more time with his young and growing family, and do the odd bit of commentary. But he will also work assiduously at trying to keep that pathway open. Loading \u201cI didn\u2019t like the Australian cricket team growing up because I didn\u2019t see myself in the team,\u201d Khawaja says. \u201cI supported the Windies or Pakistan, pretty much anyone but Australia, until the age of 13 when Gilly and Brett Lee won me over with the way they played the game. I decided \u2018I love these guys\u2019. They didn\u2019t seem like that older generation.\u201d",

    "text": "Unconventional Venues Loni Peterson, the owner of LP Creative Events in Denver, says wedding venues will continue to be more surprising with spaces such as historic ruins, caves and airport hangars. \u201cCouples want their special day to stand out among the noise and one way they can do that is by hosting their guests at a \u2018non wedding\u2019 venue,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are also having couples holding their events in open fields, fairgrounds and ski and snowboard trails.\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Jodie Haydon were among those who married at non wedding venues in 2025 when they tied the knot at The Lodge. They also wrote their own vows. Credit: Mike Bowers\n\nMultiple Celebrations Xin Huang, a wedding planner and the owner of Le Petite Priv\u00e9 in New York, says she is seeing many couples host celebrations spread out over months \u2013 whether with a cultural ceremony or a reception months before or after the legal marriage, or separate receptions months apart. Couples are also celebrating across cities or countries that have meaning to them or where their loved ones live. \u201cThis is a beautiful way to parade your love and share what is important to you in the different settings and cultures that speak to you,\u201d Huang says. Projected Videos \u201cWith draping and white colour schemes being two huge decor trends in 2025, there has been a natural progression with the use of projection,\u201d says Jessica Ralph, the owner and executive planner of Parties A La Carte in Tampa Bay, Florida.\n\nLoading \u201cDraped, sheer white overlay creates an effective backdrop for projection and an elevated, romantic setting.\u201d (Videos can be displayed on a blank wall, with rear projection used to ensure a seamless set-up.) Some couples are also using a mix of photos from their relationship, while others are focusing on engagement session images, says Masha Sakhno, the founder of Masha Sakhno Photo in Honolulu. In addition to sharing their love story, couples are also displaying images of family members. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to add sentiment and nostalgia to the celebration,\u201d she says. Memorable Entertainment Wedding attendees can expect to be entertained more. Couples are welcoming guests with musicians and dancers, blending DJs with live bands (or saxophones), and introducing unexpected performances during cocktail hour. Many are also adding activities that engage other senses, such as coffee stations, gelato carts or custom fragrance bars.\n\nLoading \u201cCouples are seeking those surprise-and-delight moments that make guests feel part of something personal and alive,\u201d says Fallon Carter, an event planner and the founder of Fallon Carter Events in Washington, DC. Love Notes Pinterest\u2019s 2026 trends predictions anticipate a resurgence in personalised notes and letters. Peterson says more of her clients were incorporating notes to their guests in their reception decor. \u201cI\u2019m seeing them find unique ways to connect with each guest,\u201d she says, \u201cwhether thanking them for travelling to celebrate their marriage, including an inside joke or introducing them to the person sitting next to them at their table.\u201d Heidi Moore, a stationer and the owner of Idieh Design, based in Phoenix, has also noticed that many of her clients are choosing to leave individualised notes.\n\n\u201cSome craft one message per couple, while others write a unique note for each person,\u201d she says. Sometimes handwriting is replaced with handwritten-style fonts to save time. Dessert Cocktails Couples will be incorporating signature dessert cocktails during the cake cutting to elevate the moment, says Koby Morris, the owner of Southern Standard, an events bar services company based in New Braunfels, Texas. Decadent, fruity mocktails and espresso martinis are favourites that will be also trending in 2026. Curated Food There is an increasing focus on food as part of the overall design, rather than simply sustenance, says Alice Wilkes, a wedding planner and the founder of Alice Wilkes Design in London.\n\n\u201cPlanners are seeing a growing interest in the presentation of food itself, with beautifully styled dishes, canapes and drinks becoming an extension of the event\u2019s aesthetic and storytelling,\u201d she says. \u201cCouples are embracing elevated dessert rooms, tasting stations and interactive chef-led moments.\u201d It\u2019s no longer a case of chicken or beef at weddings with more emphasis on presentation and curated menus. Deborah Miller, the founder of Deborah Miller Catering & Events in New York, is seeing more couples opt for cocktail-style wedding receptions, with food stations, passed canapes and small plates over more traditional plated dinners. \u201cThis allows for a lot more culinary creativity,\u201d Miller says.\n\nBold Colours and Stripes Pinterest\u2019s 2026 trends report also predicts that vivid colours and stripes will inspire decor choices, which event planners forecast will influence weddings. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing couples choosing to make a statement with saturated colours,\u201d says Dawn Crothers, the president and creative director of Something Vintage Rentals, based in Temple Hills, Maryland. \u201cHues like red, teal, burgundy and deep green will be strong for 2026.\u201d \u201cFull-colour tablescapes, mixed-hue glassware, layered colourful florals and vivid linens will be popular for creating immersive, theatrical environments,\u201d says Sarah Farsh, an owner and the creative director of Olympic Valley Stables, an event venue in Olympic Valley, California, and an owner of Tahoe Engaged, a wedding vendor directory. Bridal Party Outfit Changes Second looks are no longer just for the bride and groom. Patricia Voto, a New York-based designer and the founder of One Of, recently created three looks for a mother of the bride, who changed from ceremony to reception to after-party.",

    "text": "Platinum, used in high-end jewellery, benefited from the lift in gold. At half the price of its shiny precious metal counterpart, platinum is relatively cheap for jewellers. It is also a metal important to vehicle production, both internal combustion and electric. Throw in the Trump turmoil and a global shortage (due to a fall in the world\u2019s largest producer nation, South Africa) and you set the stage for one of the most unexpected increases in value for a precious metal this year. But crypto became even more cryptic\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s election was a very different story for another, much more volatile, investment class. Backers of cryptocurrencies believed the new president would drive prices up. There was speculation that Bitcoin \u2013 then trading at about $US100,000 \u2013 would move through the $US150,000 mark. But Bitcoin finishes the year around the $US87,000 mark, having tumbled from its October peak of $US124,700. It\u2019s not just Bitcoin that has suffered as investors have shunned more colourful investment opportunities due to concerns over American inflation. By some estimates, more than $US1 trillion in value was wiped from cryptocurrencies through the final three months of 2025.\n\nThe inopportune trade surplus with the United States Australia produces very little platinum. But it is one of the world\u2019s biggest gold producers. The big lift in gold prices did something that had not happened since Harry Truman was in the White House \u2013 deliver Australia a trade surplus with the United States. In January, February, March and then in July, gold was a key factor in Australia selling more goods and services to the US than buying them.\n\nWith Donald Trump attacking any nation that ran a trade surplus with the US (the penguins and seals of Heard and McDonald Islands at one point faced an American tariff hit), it could not have come at a worse time. It hasn\u2019t been helped by the drop-off in American tourism to Australia. There were almost 100,000 fewer visitors from the US over the past 12 months compared with the same period ahead of COVID. American tourists aren\u2019t getting as much value for their greenback, either. A big global story has been the drop in the value of the United States dollar. The Australian dollar appreciated by 8 per cent against its US counterpart.\n\nThat might make it more enticing for prospective Australian tourists to check out Trump\u2019s America \u2013 as long as they\u2019re ready to hand over all their social media history. The taxman cometh Even Jim Chalmers could not believe the position Peter Dutton took ahead of the 2025 election. The Coalition went to voters opposed to Labor\u2019s modest personal income tax cuts that start flowing from July 1 this year. Loading The tax cuts, which will be delivered over two years, were the one big surprise out of Chalmers\u2019 March budget. Even more surprising was the Coalition\u2019s opposition.\n\nThe budget is increasingly reliant on personal income tax collections. A combination of bracket creep, a strong jobs market and a tax system that gives more concessions to wealth and assets (particularly those held by older Australians) means the tax burden on ordinary workers is growing. The mid-year budget update revealed that of all income taxes collected by the government \u2013 personal, company, superannuation, petroleum and fringe benefits \u2013 the share coming from workers is on track to hit 69 per cent by 2028-29. Cost-of-living crisis? Try 1692 per cent inflation The re-emergence of inflation pressures, both in Australia and around the world, caught pundits and central banks off guard.\n\nDomestically, trying to track accurately price pressures across the economy was made more difficult by government energy subsidies. Headline inflation, which had peaked at 7.8 per cent in late 2022, tumbled to 1.9 per cent by the middle of this year. But then came the end of various state and federal electricity subsidies. While the federal government\u2019s $75-a-quarter subsidy finally ended with the calendar year, the biggest impact occurred in Brisbane where the former Miles government\u2019s $1000 came to an end in June. That led to electricity inflation in Brisbane jumping by a mind-boggling 1692.5 per cent in July. A year earlier, it had been minus 93 per cent. By year\u2019s end, Brisbane\u2019s overall inflation rate was a nation-leading 5.2 per cent.\n\nWhile electricity prices have been upended by government action, coffee prices have soared due to international factors. A global supply shortage due to poor weather in key growing areas has meant that anyone with a coffee (or chocolate) addiction has had to pay through the nose for their daily caffeine hit. The single largest weekly purchase by Australian households is the fuel for their cars. During 2025, Peter Dutton spent much of the election campaign visiting service stations and promising that a Coalition government would halve the fuel excise for 12 months. But petrol prices were relatively stable. Even as Dutton was manhandling bowsers everywhere he went, petrol was actually cheaper than it had been a year earlier.\n\nThe Uncertainty Index If you were confused by the economic events of the year, spare a thought for the Reserve Bank. It started the year with its first interest rate cut since the start of the COVID pandemic amid signs that inflation was easing. Despite three rate cuts, the bank finished the year with financial markets tipping it would start lifting interest rates in February.\n\nLoading In a sign of the economic rollercoaster faced by the bank, following Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs, it actually discussed a half percentage point rate cut to offset a global downturn. Every three months, the bank issues its \u201cstatement on monetary policy\u201d, which contains key forecasts as well as a general discussion of the economy\u2019s outlook. It was in the May iteration of that statement that the bank\u2019s confusion \u2013 shared by the rest of the world \u2013 became clear. That one statement used the term \u201cuncertain\u201d on 132 occasions.\n\nNever before had the bank been so unsure of the future. A growing population \u2013 but more slowly One of the most politically charged debates of the year has been population growth or, more specifically, net overseas migration. Australia has increasingly relied on migrants to grow the population, fill specialised and non-skilled jobs while international students had become the cash cows of the nation\u2019s universities. But the post-COVID surge in migration, on top of a lift in house prices (which picked up as soon as the Reserve Bank started cutting interest rates), combined to give the debate over immigration a sharp political edge through 2025.\n\nSince the international border was reopened in early 2022, net overseas migration has added almost 1.5 million residents to the country. Some of the surge was due to the two-year closure of the international border. In particular, students who had not been able to get into the country flooded back (and provided much-needed staff to the nation\u2019s cafes and restaurants). That pushed net overseas migration to a record 555,000 in late 2023. It has eased since then, so much so that the government\u2019s own budget estimates for the 2024-25 overestimated net overseas migration by 30,000.",

We\u2019re less than 10 per cent of their total beef imports.\u201d\n\nAnthony Albanese and Trade Minister Don Farrell \u201cneed to make sure that they\u2019re in there and get a carve out\u201d for Australia, Mr Littleproud said, because the current circumstances would make it \u201cunviable\u201d.\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud has urged the federal government to take swift action. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nAgriculture Minister Julie Collins has revealed the Australian government has already made \u201cmade representations at the highest senior ministerial levels\u201d to its Chinese counterparts over the tariffs.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC, Ms Collins reiterated Australia had not been singled out by China, but that the changes were to apply to all of China\u2019s overseas imports.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is for all of their importers, they\u2019ve done an average,\u201d she told the ABC.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve said, \u2018This is your average of what you\u2019re allowed to send into China and then, (anything) over that there will be a tariff applied\u2019.\u201d\n\nAgriculture Minister Julie Collins said Australia had lobbied the Chinese government over the tariffs. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nMs Collins said the government did have \u201cserious concerns about the way\u201d the tariffs were being applied but added \u201cwe have not been singled out yet\u201d.\n\nAustralia\u2019s argument to China was that its exports were not a threat to China\u2019s domestic industry, and Australian beef was a high-quality product desired by the Chinese market, she said.\n\n\u2018Severe impact\u2019: AMIC to lobby government\n\nA peak body has claimed the move could affect more than $1bn in trade between the two countries.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn Thursday, the Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC) criticised the move, saying it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d with the announcement.\n\nThe changes would have the potential to reduce Australian beef exports to China by about one-third compared with the past year, which accounted for trade worth more than $A1bn, it said.\n\n\u201cThis decision appears to reward other countries who have surged the volume of beef exported to the Chinese market in recent years,\u201d AMIC chief executive Tim Ryan said.\n\n\u201cThis decision will have a severe impact on trade flows to China over the duration of the measures\u2019 enforcement, disrupt the longstanding relationships fostered under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, and restrict the ability for Chinese consumers to access safe and reliable Australian beef.\u201d\n\nAustralian beef imports to China have been hit with a 55 per cent tariff. Picture: NewsWire / Nikki Sho\n\nAlong with Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA), AMIC complied with the Chinese government\u2019s year-long investigation preceding the changes, the peak body said, including providing formal evidence at in-person hearings in China and hosting Chinese investigators in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDuring this period, AMIC and MLA \u201crepeatedly stressed\u201d Australia\u2019s position as a trusted and reliable source of beef for China and their role in meeting the country\u2019s domestic consumer demand, Mr Ryan said.\n\n\u201cImports of Australian beef are not a cause of damage to the domestic beef industry in China,\u201d he said.\n\nAMIC plans to lobby the Australian and Chinese government to consider the consequences of the measures.\n\n\u201cWe will make strong representations on our members\u2019 behalf to the Australian and Chinese governments regarding the severe and unnecessary impact of these new measures,\u201d Mr Ryan said.\n\n\u201cRegardless of our disappointment with these safeguard measures, AMIC will continue to work constructively with our Chinese counterparts to mutually improve our respective industries for long-term prosperity.\u201d\n\nAnthony Albanese has downplayed the impact of the Chinese tariffs. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\n\u2018Australia not singled out\u2019: PM\n\nThe Prime Minister has confirmed Australian officials are communicating with their Chinese counterparts regarding the move.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMr Albanese emphasised Australia was not being targeted by China\u2019s policy, and the move had been a broad one.\n\n\u201cThis is something that wasn\u2019t Australia being singled out,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is a general position that China has put.\n\n\u201cWe are advocating, as we always do, for Australian industry.\u201d\n\nPressed on the potential impacts of the announcement, Mr Albanese declined to go into specifics, instead pointing to his belief that Australian beef was \u201cthe best in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe compete in the world very well, and our products are in great demand right around the world, we expect that will continue to be so,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe Australian beef industry has never been stronger than it is today as we enter 2026.\u201d\n\nSussan Ley was part of the cabinet that secured the China-Australia Free Trade agreement, she said. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\n\u2018Worrying\u2019: Ley on trade threat\n\nSussan Ley has described the new tariffs as \u201cworrying\u201d, and urged Mr Albanese to take strong action to protect Australian producers.\n\n\u201cAustralian beef is the best beef in the world and our trade with China is important,\u201d the Opposition Leader told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cNow to see that hesitation and threat that we have had reports of today is worrying.\n\n\u201cSo what the Prime Minister needs to do is leverage the very good relationship that he tells us he has with President Xi, and make sure he makes contact, and makes it very clear that Australia should not be included in any of these arrangements when it comes to restrictions on the trade of beef to China, or additional tariffs that may be placed on that trade.\u201d\n\nIn terms of Mr Albanese advocating the interests of Australian beef producers, Ms Ley added local industry should \u201cexpect no less\u201d of the prime minister.",
