    "text": "The US economy shrank at a 0.3 per cent annual pace from January through March, the first drop in three years, as US President Donald Trump 's trade wars disrupted business.\n\nFirst-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the US tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump imposed massive tariffs .\n\nThe January-March drop in gross domestic product \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services \u2014 was down from a 2.4 per cent gain in the last three months of 2024. Imports grew at a 41 per cent pace, the fastest since 2020, and shaved 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a signed executive order during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden of the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP)\n\nConsumer spending also slowed sharply \u2014 1.8 per cent growth from 4 per cent in October-December last year. Federal government spending plunged 5.1 per cent in the first quarter.\n\nForecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet had, on average, expected the economy to eke out 0.8 per cent growth in the first quarter, but many expected GDP to fall.\n\nFinancial markets sank on the report. The Dow Jones tumbled 400 points at the opening bell shortly after the GDP numbers were released. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5 per cent and the Nasdaq composite fell 2 per cent.\n\nBut business investment rose at a 21.9 per cent clip as companies poured money into equipment.\n\nAnd a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3 per cent annual rate from January through March, up from 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThis category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Labor projected for majority win in latest YouGov poll\n\nAnthony Matesic works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nTrump took to his social media platform Truth Social to blame his predecessor Joe Biden for the figures, saying he \"didn't take over until January 20th\".\n\n\"Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers,\" he said.\n\n\"Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.'\n\n\"This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!\"\ufeff\n\nTrump's comments about the current state of the economy come after he took credit for a boom period early last year.\n\nIn January 2024 he posted \"THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET\" on Truth Social, off the back of the US stock market posting positive results. Biden was still president at the time.\ufeff\n\nA post on Truth Social by Donald Trump, dated January 30, 2024. He writes about taking credit for a booming economy off the back of his own poll numbers while Joe Biden was still president. (Truth Social)\n\nThe surge in imports \u2014 the fastest since 1972 outside COVID-19 economic disruptions \u2014 is likely to reverse in the second quarter, removing a weight on GDP.\n\nFor that reason, Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics forecasts that April-June growth will rebound to a 2 per cent gain.\n\nBut many economists say that Trump's massive import taxes \u2014 the erratic way he's rolled them out \u2014 will hurt growth in the second half of the year and that recession risks are rising.\n\nWednesday's report also showed an increase in prices that is likely to worry the Federal Reserve which is still trying to cool inflation after a severe pandemic run-up.\n\nREAD MORE: Man drives onto jetty and is blocked from leaving\n\nShipping containers are seen ready for transport at the Guangzhou Port in the Nansha district in southern China's Guangdong province, April 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)\n\nThe Fed's favoured inflation gauge \u2013 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index \u2013 rose at an annual rate of 3.6 per cent, up from 2.4 per cent in the fourth quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PC inflation registered 3.5 per cent, compared with 2.6 per cent from October-December. The central bank wants to see inflation at 2 per cent .\n\nThe first-quarter GDP numbers \"highlight the bind that the Federal Reserve is in,\" Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics wrote in a commentary.\n\nThe Fed must weigh whether to cut interest rates to support economic growth or leave rates high because of elevated inflation.\n\n\"The economy was essentially stagnant in the first three months of the year while growth in headline and core inflation accelerated, fanning concerns of stagflation.''\n\nTrump inherited a solid economy that had grown steadily despite high interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to members of the Michigan National Guard at Selfridge Air National Guard Base on Tuesday. (AP)\n\nHis erratic trade policies \u2014 including 145 per cent tariffs on China \u2014 have paralysed businesses and threatened to raise prices and hurt consumers.\n\nThere is potential evidence emerging that the solid job market, a pilar of the US economy during the pandemic recession, may be weakening.\n\nOn Wednesday, payroll provider ADP showed that companies added just 62,000 jobs in April, about half of what was expected, and down from 147,000 in March. That could be a signal that businesses may be taking a more cautious approach to hiring amid uncertainty over tariffs. Still, the ADP figures often diverge from the government's jobs reports.\n\nEmployers in the education and health, information technology, and business and professional services industries all cut jobs. Business and professional services include sectors such as engineering, accounting and advertising.\n\n\"Unease is the word of the day,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.\n\n\"It can be difficult to make hiring decisions in such an environment.\"",

    "text": "Australia's Bendigo Bank is predicting four more rate cuts, including one this month, after the latest Reserve Bank's figures , released yesterday, revealed underlying inflation has moved into its target range.\n\nBendigo Bank's chief economist David Robertson said he now expected the central bank to shift its \"laser sharp focus on inflation\" to other areas of the economy.\n\n\"The RBA has been dealing with global inflation shock for three years but its concerns are quickly moving from price stability and inflation to protecting growth and jobs,\" Robertson said.\n\nThe RBA is now expected to cut interest rates in May, with more reductions to come. (Nine)\n\nWhile yesterday's RBA's headline inflation figure remained unchanged at 2.4 per cent, the trimmed mean, the Reserve Bank's favoured measure of core or underlying inflation, has slowed from 3.3 per cent to 2.9 per cent - putting it back in the target range for the first time since December 2021.\n\nThe inflation data had set the scene for a May rate cut, Robertson said in his latest economic update, the only question was a matter of by how much.\n\n\"The next cut is almost certain for May 20, but of what magnitude?\" he said.\n\n\"We have four more cuts, including May, in our forecasts taking the rate down to around 3.1 per cent, a drop of 25 basis points per quarter.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the markets are now factoring in five rate cuts to around a 2.8 per cent level by year-end. It's a deeper path than previously expected.\"\n\nWhile the RBA could ease rates quickly if global conditions suddenly worsen, Robertson said this looked like an unlikely course of action for the moment.\n\n\"A larger 50 basis point cut in May is most unlikely unless markets become dislocated like in the GFC, which isn't currently visible, but a 35 basis point cut from the RBA in May would round out the cash rate to more convenient fractions.\"\n\nGlobal markets were facing extreme turbulence in the face of uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's global tariffs, despite the latest exemptions and deferrals, he said.\n\n\"Equity markets have been clawing back some of their losses but there are still difficult times ahead,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"Tariffs are generally bad for everyone but especially problematic for the country imposing them. So with the escalation between the US and China - the world's two largest economies - it's a question of just how much slower these economies will be growing this year and next.\"\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) now forecasts US growth will reduce by a third to 1.8 per cent this year, and China's GDP growth is projected at 4 per cent (down from 4.6 percent).\n\nAustralia has not been immune from the tariff turbulence, with local growth rates also downgraded.",

(ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nWith minimal options for recycling in the city of 40,000 people, Mr Barker's business was immediately overwhelmed.\n\nBut a forced closure due to a lack of profit has put the town back to square one on recycling.\n\nFinding a new purpose\n\nMike Barker said he was struggling with severe depression and about to do his second \"work for the dole\" program through Centrelink before he put his dream of helping the climate into action.\n\nMike Barker says finding ways to help his town recycle has changed his life. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nHe noticed a bed frame on the side of the road discarded as trash and thought \"with a few extra screws\" it had the potential to be as good as new.\n\nBefore he knew it, Mr Barker had opened a workshop to see what more he could recycle.\n\n\"I didn't plan to go into the volunteer part of the workforce but it just sort of fell into place,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought here I was getting over my depression and put it out there that volunteers were welcome of any physical or mental capacity.\"\n\nGeraldton Geraldton & Midwest E-waste was fuelled by volunteers. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nRenewed calls for recycling focus\n\nAlmost a decade later, the company was recycling \"basically everything from your toaster upwards\", including plastics, glass and electronics.\n\nNew items such as bowls and plates made from recycled materials were also sold to customers on Facebook and at local market stalls.\n\nGeraldton & Midwest E-waste provided \"opportunities locally\", where around three volunteers ended up helping at the facility daily.\n\nMr Barker said he was proud of the difference he made to the environment, but struggled to make a profit.\n\nMike Barker says seeing his recycling dream end has him feeling \"like a failure\". (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\n\"We've achieved thousands of tonnes of small appliances not going into landfill every year,\" he said.\n\n\"We've expanded out further through Dongara, Jurien, Northampton and Shark Bay contracts with the local shires.\n\n\"But unfortunately that's not enough to keep our head above water.\"\n\nMr Barker said without an e-waste recycling facility in town it created a big gap for the Midwest.\n\nMr Barker says the facility was able to recycle almost everything from a kitchen appliance. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\n\"[Geraldton] was 30 years behind everyone else already and now [this closure] will take us another step back,\" he said.\n\n\"Because I don't see anyone in local government stepping up to make a difference and that's what this was \u2014 trying to educate people.\n\n\" You can tell by the amount of people that come in here every week, we've got thousands of supporters and they're all heartbroken. \"\n\nA costly process\n\nCity of Greater Geraldton deputy mayor Natasha Colliver said the community was sad to see the facility close, but if residents wanted to recycle they just had to \"look hard and do some research\" about the options in town.\n\nWhile Ms Colliver accepted waste management was a local government responsibility, she said cost was the underlying barrier.\n\n\"Off the top of my head the current rubbish levy sits at around $400 and if we were to introduce yellow-top bins you'd be looking at doubling that,\" she said.\n\n\"[If ratepayers] didn't want that extra cost then we'd have to look at cutting another service so it's that really wicked dilemma.\"\n\nNatasha Colliver says the council \"can't afford\" kerbside recycling. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nCurrently, council only provides one bin to each household for all waste.\n\nDespite years of residents calling for kerbside recycling, Ms Colliver said there still had not been direct community consultation about the topic.\n\n\"But perhaps it might be a good idea to run a survey around this,\" she said.\n\nMs Colliver said as people moved from metropolitan areas to the region they were often shocked at the lack of kerbside recycling and it highlighted a \"disappointing\" difference between cities and the country.\n\nGeraldton & Midwest E-waste have stopped accepting new waste. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\n\"It really comes down to an equity issue and where I think regional people miss out on lots of things because it's not a fair playing ground,\" she said.\n\n\" It's just really hard for us to fulfil everything [state government] wants to do in the waste space \u2026 there's a lot of great things but regional councils just can't afford it. \"\n\nThe ABC contacted Environment Minister Reece Whitby for comment but did not receive a response by deadline.",

Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor will claim the Coalition's budget deficits would be at least $10 billion smaller than Labor's forecast $150 billion shortfalls over four years.\n\nAt the start of the campaign, in late March, the research group found Labor was on 50.2 per cent and the Coalition on 49.8 per cent.\n\nA separate Redbridge-Accent poll published in the Daily Telegraph on Thursday mirrored the YouGov results, showing Labor has extended its lead by an extra point to 53 per cent.\n\nBoth polls indicate Labor would win a second term in office on Saturday and may potentially expand its majority.\n\nAn analysis by YouGov projects Labor could win between 76 seats and 85 seats.\n\nMr Dutton, speaking from his northern Brisbane seat of Dickson, sought to downplay the significance of the Coalition's election campaign performance, which is facing growing internal Coalition criticism for being ill-prepared and mistake-ridden.\n\nSetbacks have included Mr Dutton not appearing to know the price of eggs, prematurely musing about life in Kirribilli, reversing a planned ban on public service work from home rules, \"verballing\" the Indonesian president, and admitting he did \"not know\" Donald Trump despite guaranteeing he would land a trade deal in his first months in office.\n\nThe Coalition has also struggled to sell its cornerstone nuclear power policy and suffered an industry backlash \u2014 including from Coalition fundraiser Gina Rinehart \u2014 over Mr Dutton's plan to intervene in the gas market.\n\n\"This election really is a referendum, not about the election campaign, but about the last three years of government,\" Mr Dutton said. \"Are you better off today than you were three years ago?\"\n\n'Nervous' Albanese also confronts dwindling primary\n\nDespite the poll trends, Mr Albanese continued to downplay his prospects, admitting to Sydney's KIIS FM that; \"I'm nervous\".\n\n\"Elections are tough \u2026 and they're tough to win. And here's a little fun fact for you, there has not been a prime minister re-elected since John Howard in 2004. [For] 21 years we've had a revolving door\".\n\nDespite Labor's lead in the headline national two-party preferred polls, both sides of politics are predicted to suffer weak levels of primary support.\n\nPeter Dutton drops vow to change school curriculum, after 'indoctrination' claims Photo shows Dutton looks down the barrell of the camera. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has dropped his vow to change the national school curriculum, after comments earlier in the campaign that students should be able to think freely without being \"indoctrinated\" by educators.\n\nYouGov said 31.4 per cent of voters say they will give their first preferences to Labor, with the Coalition capturing about the same, or 31.1 per cent. Both would be lower than the last election.\n\nGreens are estimated to capture 12.6 per cent of the vote, on par with the party's 2022 result, while Pauline Hanson's One Nation has lifted its base from 5 per cent three years ago to 9.3 per cent.\n\n\"Others\" are at 7.2 per cent, down from 9.2 per cent in 2022.\n\nYouGov's research was based on responses from 1,100 voters between last Thursday and Tuesday.It's two-party preferred results were based on \"respondent-allocated\" preferences, rather than the 2022 patterns.\n\nThe low primary support suggests preference flows will play an outsized role in Saturday's final results, particularly in outer-urban electorates, where there are signs disgruntled One Nation voters are more likely to preference the Liberal Party than in the past.\n\nYouGov's \"central\" case is for Labor to win 84 seats, with the Coalition falling to 47 seats, and the Greens retaining 3 seats. Independents would hold 14 and \"others\" would have the remaining two seats of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe group believes its data indicates all sitting independents would win their seats on Saturday, with the Coalition to also lose the electorates of Bradfield, Calare, Cowper, Monash and Wannon.\n\nBy contrast, the Coalition would regain from Labor the seat of Aston, which the government won in a by-election in 2023.\n\nIt also suggests the three Queensland seats held by the Greens will be close-run contests that remain too close to predict.\n\n\"While Labor is favoured to win Brisbane and Griffith from the Greens, the results will be determined by the preferences of voters of the third-placed party in what are three-way contests between Labor, Greens and the Coalition,\" YouGov said.\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

    "text": "Australia's Dyson Daniels has been named the NBA's most improved player.\n\nDaniels, who plays for Atlanta Hawks, beat out fellow finalists Ivica Zubac (Los Angeles Clippers) and Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons).\n\nThe 22-year-old emerged as a productive starter at shooting guard for the Hawks after arriving in Atlanta in the trade that sent high-scoring guard Dejounte Murray to New Orleans on July 6.\n\nBefore the trade, Daniels was best known for his defensive play.\n\nInjuries and other trades helped clear the way for the 6-foot-7 Daniels to flourish as a scoring complement to Trae Young while providing impressive all-around production.\n\nBendigo-born Daniels is now entrenched as an important foundation player for the Hawks, joining Young, forward Jalen Johnson and 2024 number one overall NBA draft pick Zaccharie Risacher.\n\nHe led the NBA with 229 steals, the most since Seattle's Gary Payton had 231 in the 1995/96 season.\n\nDaniels finished as the runner-up to Cleveland's Evan Mobley in the voting for NBA defensive player of the year.\n\nHis nickname \u2014 'Great Barrier Thief' \u2014 is a nod to his roots in Australia and defensive prowess.\n\nDaniels's impressive gains as a scorer, defender, rebounder and playmaker helped him claim the top spot in the voting for most improved player.\n\nThanks to his role as a starter beside Young in Atlanta's back-court, Daniels improved his scoring from 5.8 points per game with New Orleans in 2023/24 to 14.1.\n\nHis rebounds rose from 3.9 to 5.9, his steals from 1.4 to 3.0 and his assists from 2.7 to 4.4.\n\nDaniels became only the fifth player since 1973/74 to average at least 14.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.0 steals, joining Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Michael Ray Richardson and Alvin Robertson.\n\nThe most improved player award, like several other NBA honours, was voted on by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league and cast ballots shortly after the end of the regular season.\n\nAP",

    "text": "US President Donald Trump appeared to suggest he knew more about interest rates than Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and said rates should be cut.\n\n\"Mortgage rates are actually down slightly even though I have a guy in the Fed that I'm not a huge fan of,\" Mr Trump said at a White House event.\n\n\"[Mr Powell] should reduce interest rates.\n\n\" I think I understand interest a lot better than him because I've had to really use interest rates. \"\n\nThe president's comments came after the US economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter of the year.\n\nAccording to a report released by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, American Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decreased at an annualised rate of 0.3 per cent between January and March.\n\nThat was worse than the 0.3 per cent growth economists had been forecasting, and came amid deep uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's broad tariffs.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has continued to spruik his government's economic record on the same day figures showed the national economy contracted. (Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein)\n\nThe latest data marks the American economy's worst performance in three years, and a dramatic reversal on the 2.4 per cent annualised growth recorded in the last three months of 2024.\n\nDespite those figures, Mr Trump continued to spruik his government's economic record during an address to American business leaders on Wednesday, local time, and suggested he would look to implement fresh tariffs on pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\"We're going to be getting tremendous amounts of drug and pharmaceutical companies that are going to be pouring into the country,\" he said.\n\n\"We're going to give them a lot of time to do it, but after that, there's going to be a tariff wall put up, and they won't be happy about it.\n\n\"They'll be happy if they start building right now. Right now, it's going to be 'build', and after a certain period of time, it's going to get tougher, tougher, tougher, and then it's going to be real hard to do business in this country.\"\n\nThe president said during an earlier meeting of his cabinet that he believes Americans don't need much of what China exports, while dismissing the possible effect of a trade war on consumers caused by his triple-digit tariffs on Beijing.\n\nThe tariffs have hit China hard, Mr Trump said, and as a result, China's factories are \"not doing business\".\n\nUS economy shrinks 0.3 per cent Photo shows Man in a suit speaking into a microphone behind a podium while holding up a chart A flood of imports into the United States ahead of the Trump administration's tariffs have dampened economic growth.\n\nThe president downplayed the impact of fewer Chinese imports, saying \"maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally\".\n\nEarlier, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer revealed that while the Trump administration expects to conclude initial tariff deals with some trading partners within weeks, negotiations with India are not yet \"finish-line close\", and no official talks with China are underway.\n\nMr Greer told Fox News Channel that the administration \"targeted\" deals focused on increased market access for US exports, reducing tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, and enhancing US economic security.\n\n\"I would say that we have deals that are, that are close,\" he said.\n\n\"As the negotiator, I don't like to negotiate in public, but I will say we're talking about a matter of weeks and not months, to have some initial deals announced.\"\n\nIn recent days, Trump officials have said that a deal with one key unnamed trading partner has been reached but needs approval from the country's parliament and prime minister.\n\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is set to meet with representatives from Japan, Guyana, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines to negotiate fresh trade deals amid President Trump's tariffs. (Reuters: Kevin Mohatt)\n\nMr Greer said he would look to meet with representatives from Japan, Guyana and Saudi Arabia on Thursday and the Philippines on Friday, and is working closely with South Korea and Britain.\n\nHe also said he is telling counterparts that they should reduce tariff levels and \"take down your non-tariff barriers that stop me from sending my industrial and ag (agriculture) to your country\".\n\nWhile Mr Greer said there were no official talks with China taking place, he confirmed he had a call with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng announcing steep reciprocal tariffs on April 2.\n\n\"Instead of having an economy that's financed by the government, we want to make real stuff and sell it, and it means we have to deal with foreign trade practices that are harmful, including in China,\" Mr Greer said.\n\nUS Senate rejects bill to rein in Trump tariffs\n\nHours after the revelation that the US economy has contracted for the first time in three years, an evenly split US Senate rejected the latest bipartisan bid to block Mr Trump's tariffs.\n\nThree Republicans joined Democrats to support the measure to terminate the national emergency that Mr Trump declared as the basis for 10 per cent global tariffs on US trading partners and higher reciprocal tariffs on 57 trading partners, including the European Union.\n\nBig moments from Trump's first 100 days Photo shows Donald Trump sits in front of gold curtains. April 29 marks day 100 of Donald Trump's extraordinarily eventful second term as US president. Here's some of what you might have missed.\n\nThe 49-49 vote fell short of the simple majority needed to pass the resolution and send it on to the House of Representatives.\n\nRepublican support had reduced from weeks prior, when four Senate Republicans joined Democrats to pass a similar bill to terminate new tariffs on Canada. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority.\n\n\"The United States Senate cannot be an idle spectator in the tariff madness. The Congress has the power to set tariffs and regulate global trade,\" senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who introduced the resolution, said ahead of the vote.\n\nThe resolution was co-sponsored by Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 an outspoken critic of Trump's tariff policy.\n\nIt also drew support from Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Senator Mitch McConnell, a fourth Republican who had voted for the earlier measure, was absent.\n\n\"It's not perfect. I think it's too broad. But it sends the message that I want to send \u2014 that we really need to be far more discriminatory in imposing these tariffs and not treat allies like Canada the way we treat adversaries like China,\" Senator Collins of Maine told reporters.\n\nThe earlier measure, which had multiple Republican sponsors, went nowhere in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which last month blocked the ability of Congress to move quickly to challenge Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe White House threatened to veto the latest resolution on Monday, saying it would undermine national and economic security.\n\nReuters",

    "text": "Australian winemakers are deeply concerned about recent data indicating the nation is exporting some of its lowest wine volumes in more than two decades.\n\nExcluding China, the amount of Australian wine exported to the rest of the world declined in the past 12 months, as cheaper, bulk wine falls out of favour and health-conscious consumers drink less.\n\nWhile China took $1.03 billion worth of Australia's premium wine last year, Wine Australia's latest report shows the lucrative market has cooled from its peak.\n\nIt has prompted Australian winemakers to again call for support to find new markets, or transition out of the industry.\n\nThe Chinese market for Australian wine producers has reduced by more than two-thirds since 2018. (Supplied Kingston Wine Estates)\n\nWine Australia marketing insights manager Peter Bailey said the industry faced tough times, and it could get worse.\n\n\"What it shows is the global wine market is facing considerable headwinds, which are impacting on the results outside of China, and they're unlikely to be resolved in the near term,\" he said.\n\n\" We're seeing a long-term trend of consumers drinking less alcohol due to health and wellbeing concerns, and more recently it's been around cost-of-living pressures, and these could get worse in certain markets given the economic and political turmoil taking place globally. \"\n\nPremium wine drives growth\n\nAustralia's overall wine exports increased 41 per cent in value last year to reach $2.64 billion, while overall volume increased by just six per cent.\n\nThe increase in value was attributed mainly to premium wine heading to China after the removal of hefty tariffs last year.\n\nBut the volume of wine exported to China was well below its pre-tariff peak, while exports to the rest of the world dropped by nine per cent.\n\nAlmost 60 per cent of the wine produced in Australia is exported. (ABC Riverland: Will Hunter)\n\nMr Bailey said China remained keen on Australia's premium wine but was not the solution to the industry's wider crisis.\n\n\"The lower volume and higher value demonstrate that China is very much a premium market for Australian wine and will therefore not solve any oversupply issues,\" he said.\n\nCall for government support\n\nKingston Estate Wines, in South Australia's Riverland, is one of Australia's leading bulk wine exporters.\n\nManaging director Bill Moularadellis said the entire industry was adapting to a very different Chinese market since tariffs.\n\nBill Moularadellis from Kingston Wine Estates says the drop in global wine consumption is a major concern for the industry. (Supplied: Kingston Estate Wines)\n\n\"We're all competing in a much smaller market, and there's been significant price deflation,\" he said.\n\nMr Moularadellis said some premium brands had been able to grow sales in China, but it was important to look at the full picture.\n\n\"It will be a mistake to allow the Chinese export sales growth to hide and mask the contraction in world consumption and exports into our established markets,\" he said.\n\nKingston Estate Wines exports about 90 per cent of its total production. (Supplied: Kingston Estate Wines)\n\nMr Moularadellis said the \"seismic shift\" in global drinking habits required new markets and products to revive the industry.\n\n\"There has been a focus on premiumisation, and with that, there's been an abandonment of new product development that's targeted at new wine consumers,\" he said.\n\n\"We must concentrate our efforts and resources on entry-level products that recruit new consumers that ultimately become the premium wine consumers of tomorrow.\"\n\nMr Moularadellis said the industry was \"unfairly disadvantaged\" through China's tariffs and needed government assistance through an expanded export market development grant scheme.\n\nAustralian winemakers are concerned about low exports. (Landline: Tim Lee)\n\nSome silver linings\n\nMatt McCulloch, managing director at Langmeil Winery in the Barossa, welcomed the news that China had imported more than $1 billion worth of Australian wine last year.\n\nAustralian wine exports fall in volume Photo shows A hand reaches for a glass of wine. A Harry Potter book is on the coffee table Australian wine exports have been hit by a global trend in people drinking less alcohol and cutting costs, but hope remains for the re-opening of a major market.\n\n\"It's good to see the recovery in pretty challenging times that we've had since COVID, and then tariffs, then geopolitical tensions, cost-of-living pressures, overall \u2026 getting back up towards about 90 per cent of where we were before the events of 2020 onward took place,\" Mr McCulloch said.\n\n\" However, that's the headline numbers. Within that, there's a lot of pain in the industry out there still at the moment. \"\n\nMr McCulloch said if consumption and production were falling for the Australian industry as a whole, but there was still an excess in the global wine sector, \"then we've got to have a look at what we'll be doing in the future\".\n\n\"Which is focusing on being a better but not bigger industry, making fewer and finer wines,\" he said.\n\n\"But that's going to be a relatively painful transition for some, more than others.\"",

    "text": "Efforts to sign up farms in Western Australia's agricultural heartland to carbon farming schemes are being questioned, with an expert labeling the practice a financial risk for growers.\n\nCarbon farming group Carbon Sync is looking to sign up growers in the catchments around Irwin and Mingenew, about 360 kilometres north of Perth in WA's Wheatbelt.\n\nThe practice changes land management strategies, including cover cropping between cash crops and time-controlled grazing to increase carbon storage in the soil.\n\nLandholders can then sell 1 tonne of stored carbon for 1 Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) to companies trying to offset carbon emissions.\n\nIndustry perspective\n\nCarbon Sync is a soil carbon farming project developer funded by Chevron.\n\nIt is the largest of its kind in WA, with 15,000 hectares under its management.\n\nLandholders pay Carbon Sync $15,000 per year for the first four years, a uniform cost, regardless of their property size.\n\nManaging director Louise Edmonds said Carbon Sync took on a proponent position for projects, meaning it held the risk and responsibility for each project's life.\n\nLouise Edmonds says she is confident in carbon farming. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Anna Cox)\n\nCarbon Sync then takes 35 per cent of the ACCUs generated.\n\nMs Edmonds said there was no data yet about how much carbon had been stored from Carbon Sync's portfolio because all projects were in their first year.\n\n\"Building soil carbon is quite a slow process, and in our projects we will baseline in the first year of the project, then come back five years later to measure the increase in soil,\" she said.\n\nMeasuring soil carbon\n\nSoil carbon is measured by assessing a 1-metre core sample in a laboratory.\n\nThe process is repeated five years later.\n\nMs Edmonds said Carbon Sync had not previously done its own testing as the project was new, but the method had been developed over 10 years.\n\n\"The whole method and the market is at a stage of maturing now where the confidence is there that it can be done,\" she said.\n\nAustralian National University environmental law and policy scholar Andrew Macintosh said he believed farmers were taking a major risk as science showed sequestration of additional amounts of carbon in the soil around Irwin and Mingenew would be \"unlikely\".\n\nAndrew Macintosh says he worries farmers are taking a major risk. (ABC News: Alex McDonald)\n\nHe said farmers signing \"permanence obligations\" of either 25 or 100 years risked not receiving credits or eventually needing to pay credits back due to no sequestration occurring.\n\n\"I'm very concerned for anybody doing a soil carbon project in [this] part of Western Australia,\" he said.\n\nMr Macintosh said storing carbon in the soil of the Midwest and Wheatbelt region was unlikely.\n\n\"It is very difficult to do so in a way that you have confidence that the credit issued in relation to changes in soil carbon actually reflect the impacts of management changes, rather than \u2026 seasonal changes,\" he said.\n\n\"Natural variability, year-to-year changes driven by climate and [seasons] both naturally result in carbon going up and down.\n\n\"Those changes are significantly larger than any management changes.\n\n\"Seasonal variability is the primary driver of the changes in soil carbon stocks.\n\n\"[The landholder] can start at a time when the soil carbon is naturally high on their land they come back five years later and due to seasonal changes [the levels] have dropped.\n\n\"So even though they've committed an action, they get no credits or revenue from what they've done.\n\n\" I think it's very unlikely that they're going to be successful. \"\n\nMs Edmonds said the concerns were \"fair\" as carbon farming had not been attempted in the area before, but Carbon Sync was confident.\n\n\"We wouldn't have invested all of the time, effort, and money into this if we didn't believe it could be done. We're out there, determining if it can be done,\" she said.\n\n\"In every agricultural innovation, there are pioneers and people who believe that it can be done and are willing to give it a go.\"\n\nProject viability\n\nMs Edmonds said projects registered five or six years ago on the east coast were now generating significant gains in soil carbon.\n\nThe Clean Energy Regulator issued 150,000 ACCUs across two projects in Queensland for the first time under the soil carbon method in 2024.\n\nTurning soil carbon into cash Photo shows A hand in the dirt holds the roots to show a close up of the root system. Dirt, bugs, microbes and carbon, Australian farmers are finally getting large-scale returns for what is sequestered in their soil\n\n\"The projects that we're registering right now [in WA] are actually trials, you could look at it like that,\" Ms Edmonds said.\n\n\"These things don't happen quickly, and the approach that we're taking is a commercial approach to demonstrating the viability of the projects.\"\n\nProfessor Macintosh said he believed a small number of projects were working as they should, but \"90 per cent or more\" were not.\n\nHe said the fundamental flaw was in the administration by the Clean Energy Regulator.\n\n\"This scheme is plagued by terrible administration by the body that is meant to regulate this,\" he said.\n\n\" I fear that these people haven't been told the whole truth. \"\n\nA spokesperson for the Clean Energy Regulator said, like any business activity, implementing emission avoidance and carbon sequestration projects would have risks.\n\nProject developers say soil carbon has never been measured in the Mid West. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Anna Cox)\n\n\"If proponents understand these risks and how to manage them, they can make informed decisions about scheme participation and maximise project outcomes,\" they said.\n\n\"Crediting risks under the Australian Carbon Credit Unit Scheme are managed by scientifically robust methods, conservative measurement and modeling approaches, and comprehensive administrative controls.\"\n\nGrower concerns\n\nChief executive of farmer representative body Mingenew Irwin Group, Dee McKeown, said he believed in the benefits of soil carbon but said growers needed more evidence before investing in the practice.\n\nDee McKeown says growers are cautious of risk. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Anna Cox)\n\n\"There is still a lot of unknown from the grower's side,\" he said.\n\n\"The soil carbon side, in particular, there are a lot of perceived restrictions in what we can do with our soil types and with our climate.\"\n\nMr McKeown said growers did not want to lose efficiencies in their operations and needed to maintain productive land with minimal risk to ensure food security for Australia.\n\n\"We don't want to put ourselves at risk. We want to know the methods available to us are genuine options to us in the region,\" he said.\n\n\"Growers are very unique in that science only applies when they see it in practice because regions are so different.\"",

    "text": "Investigators from Spain's cybersecurity agency and the CNI intelligence service will seek information from the country's grid operator, REE, and private energy companies as part of a probe into the causes of massive blackouts across Spain and Portugal, Reuters has reported.\n\nTwo sources told Reuters that the investigation would happen in full collaboration with the energy companies and was aimed at gathering all necessary data and information as soon as possible.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez has separately announced a government investigation into the massive power outage that halted trains, shut airports and trapped people in lifts on Monday across the entire Iberian peninsula.\n\nMore than 50 million people were plunged into darkness across Spain and Portugal after a massive loss of power generation sparked widespread blackouts. (Reuters: Jon Nazca)\n\nREE has denied that a dependence on solar power was to blame for Spain and Portugal being plunged into darkness, after Mr Sanchez's opponents pointed the finger at low investment in a system that increasingly relies on intermittent renewable energy sources.\n\nThe grid operator, which is headed by former Socialist minister Beatriz Corredor, has narrowed down the source of the outage to two separate incidents of loss of generation in substations in south-western Spain, but says it has yet to identify their exact location and that it is too early to explain what caused them.\n\nIn an interview with Cadena SER radio, Ms Corredor said on Wednesday that it was wrong to blame the outage on Spain's high share of renewable energy.\n\nThe mass power outages halted public transport routes, shut airports and trapped people in lifts for hours. (Reuters: Jon Nazca)\n\n\"These technologies are already stable and they have systems that allow them to operate as a conventional generation system without any safety issues,\" she said, adding she was not considering resigning.\n\nJust before the system crashed, solar energy accounted for 53 per cent of electricity production, wind for almost 11 per cent and nuclear and gas for 15 per cent, according to REE data.\n\nThe share of renewables as a source of electricity production in Spain has grown to 56 per cent in 2024 from 43 per cent a decade earlier, according to REE. Spain is targeting 81 per cent by 2030.\n\nA government investigation has now been called into the causes of the blackouts, with Spain's grid operator REE to be questioned by cybersecurity investigators. (Reuters: Bruna Casas)\n\nEnergy Minister Sara Aagesen said the government had given power companies a deadline of late on Wednesday to provide data for \"every millisecond during those five seconds\" when the system on Monday experienced a huge loss of generation, triggering a disconnection from the rest of Europe.\n\nOne problem on Monday was that there was not enough backstop stable power, such as gas and nuclear, to handle the sudden fall of power generation, an industry source told Reuters.\n\n\"The problem wasn't so much the massive entry of renewables, rather the lack of synchronous generation,\" the source said.\n\nFierce political debate rages over energy sources\n\nPolitical opponents of the Spanish prime minister have also accused him of taking too long to explain the blackout, suggesting he was covering up for failings at REE.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Since REE has ruled out the possibility of a cyber attack, we can only point to the malfunctioning of REE, which has state investment and therefore its leaders are appointed by the government,\" Miguel Tellado, a parliamentary spokesperson for the opposition conservative People's Party, said in an interview on RTVE.\n\nHe called for an independent investigation to be conducted by Spain's parliament rather than the government probe Sanchez has announced.\n\nHow a power outage caused chaos in Spain and Portugal Photo shows police officer speaks to members of the public outside a train station in madrid Traffic was gridlocked, trains stopped working, people were stuck in lifts and nuclear power stations were automatically shut down as a blackout hit tens of millions of people across Spain and Portugal.\n\nREE itself warned in May 2024 of the risks of a major outage. Renewable sources are spread across the country's territory and connect to substations that were not designed to handle high volumes of generation, it said in a report.\n\nTo withstand sudden oscillations in frequency, the grid needs to invest in load-shedding relays to act as shock absorbers when there's a plunge in generation, REE said.\n\nThis message was echoed in a January report by Spain's competition watchdog CNMC, which said the voltage on the electricity grid had sometimes \"reached maximum values close to the authorised thresholds, and have even exceeded them at certain times\".\n\nSpain's government said it had asked private energy companies for \"maximum collaboration and transparency\" to help identify the cause of the outage.\n\nAsked about the controversy, Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen said on Wednesday the cause of the blackout was still unknown and it was \"imprudent to speculate\".\n\n\"The system has worked perfectly well with similar demand and a comparable energy mix. Consequently, pointing the finger at renewables \u2026 does not seem appropriate,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Sanchez also defended his government's energy model and stressed that the cause of the outage was not yet known.\n\n\"Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear power are frankly lying or demonstrating their ignorance,\" he told a news conference.\n\n\"Nuclear power plants, far from being a solution, have been a problem\" during the blackout because \"it was necessary to divert large amounts of energy to them to keep their cores stable\", Mr Sanchez said.\n\nThe outage could have been caused by a lack of supply from stable sources such as gas, nuclear or hydropower on the day and an excess of unstable sources such as sun and wind that caused a disparity when there was a drop in demand, Jorge Sanz, former president of the Commission of Experts on Energy Transition Scenarios, told TVE.\n\nThis caused transport networks to disconnect as a precaution and triggered a collapse of the grid, he said.\n\nThe government expects private and public investment of some 52 billion euros ($92b) through 2030 to upgrade the power grid so it can handle the surge in demand from data centres and electric vehicles. Aelec, the utility lobby, has said that is not enough.\n\nJordi Sevilla, REE's chair until 2020, wrote in an opinion piece in Cinco Dias newspaper that the government was moving too fast to decommission nuclear power plants that can provide stable generation to offset the peaks and troughs of intermittent renewable energy.\n\nAFP/Reuters",

(Defence Media: CPLRobert Whitmore)\n\nAs the region's largest aid donor \u2014 as well as by far the largest and most economically powerful member of the Pacific Islands Forum \u2014 the decisions made in Canberra shape at least some lives across the Pacific.\n\nPacific leaders, officials and civil society groups will certainly be watching the result closely, even if few others in the region are.\n\nPacific leaders will watch closely whether Prime Minister Anthony Albanese holds onto government on Saturday. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)\n\nAnd some leaders have already weighed in, with PNG's foreign minister Justin Tkatchenko saying his \"personal\" hope is for a Labor win and Palau's president Surangel Whipps Jr taking a thinly veiled swipe at Peter Dutton for his decade-old quip about climate change.\n\nOthers weren't as keen to make their feelings known, with Samoa's leader Fiame Naomi Mata\u02bbafa and Tonga's prime minster Aisake Eke, declining the ABC's requests to comment.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nOn the streets of Tonga and Papua New Guinea, everyday people might not know the election is on this Saturday \u2014 but they have some strong thoughts about Australia and its influence in the region.\n\nOne lady who stopped to speak with the ABC in Port Moresby said she'd worked as a volunteer on a health program near the legendary Kokoda Trek, in a sector which often relies heavily on Australian support.\n\nShe said while Papua New Guinea was very glad to receive Australian help, too much money was still \"sucked up\" by the capital and by the government rather than reaching the rural and remote provinces which desperately need more support.\n\n\"There is so much money pumped in by [Australia],\" she said.\n\n\" We feel it's like a tea strainer \u2014 only a little [bit] pours down into the remote areas. \"\n\nIt's a common sentiment in the Pacific: people are grateful for support but feel the aid doesn't necessarily reach the intended recipients\n\nFairly or not, that means development partners like Australia \u2014 as well as local officials \u2014 sometimes bear the brunt of frustration.\n\nOne Port Moresby resident described the situation in his home province succinctly: \"All the roads are buggered.\"\n\n\" We are still backwards, not going up. \"\n\nBut, at times, Australia's long and persistent presence as a donor has also paid dividends.\n\nWhen the ABC stopped two women for a chat in Nuku'alofa this week, neither had any idea about the polls this weekend but both could nominate \u2014 without hesitation \u2014 Australian development assistance programs, including budget support for Tonga and scholarship programs.\n\n\"It's really good because they're sending our people to have an opportunity to study [in Australia] and come back and use that knowledge here to help our country develop,\" she said.\n\n'Dancing to their tune'\n\nWhatever happens on Saturday, Australian development money will continue to flow.\n\nThe Pacific takes up an ever-growing proportion of Australia's aid budget, and the Coalition has signalled that even if it does make cuts to development spending, the Pacific will be spared.\n\nThat means at least $2 billion every year will continue to be funnelled into programs across the region.\n\nAustralia will also continue to plough more and more money into loans for Pacific infrastructure projects across the region.\n\nEarlier this week, the Coalition promised it would lift the lending ceiling for the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific \u2014 which provides funding to the region's infrastructure projects \u2014 from $3 billion to $5 billion.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton has promised to increase much money Australia can lend for Pacific infrastructure. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nThat may not happen for quite some time \u2014 so far the AIFFP has only lent around $1 billion for Pacific projects \u2014 but it's a clear signal that both sides of politics will continue down this path.\n\nBoth Labor and the Coalition have also made it clear that funding regional security and policing initiatives \u2014 which are designed in part to stop China making more inroads in the space \u2014 will remain a key priority.\n\nSome Pacific development and civil society groups say no matter who wins power, they'd like to see fewer contracts handed out for \"short term\" three- or five-year programs and more money ploughed into projects tackling truly stubborn problems.\n\nIn Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa, National Coordinator for Civil Society Sesimani Lokotui says she still feels like locals could exert more control over the key development programs being funded by Australia.\n\nSesimani Lokotui, national coordinator for civil society in Tonga. (Supplied)\n\n\"What we are doing in Tonga is dancing to the tune of music that they are playing,\" she said.\n\n\"At any given point, they can change that music and we would have to [do the] choreography again.\"\n\nShe says the responsibility doesn't solely lie with Australia and other donors but with Tonga as well.\n\n\"How about we align ourselves and then give them our list of demands instead of trying to align our list of demands to their priorities.\"\n\nTransparency International Papua New Guinea chair Peter Aitsi wants more money put towards anti-corruption measures. (ABC News: Natalie Whiting)\n\nBack in Port Moresby, the board chairman of Transparency International PNG Peter Aitsi told the ABC that while Australian assistance on infrastructure and security was invaluable, he'd like to see more funding for programs designed to root out corruption and build \"institutional change\".\n\n\"Our country is going through some very, very difficult times, and a lot of that is as a result of neglect of our government systems over decades,\" he said.\n\n\"That requires a significant amount of effort and dedication to really see improvement in the government system. That will allow us to better implement and utilise assistance from overseas partners like Australia.\"\n\nRival visions\n\nPerhaps the biggest point of difference between the two sides of politics when it comes to the election is on migration policy \u2014 although the debate has been exceptionally low key in Australia, and hasn't really filtered out into the Pacific.\n\nBoth the Coalition and Labor continue back the Pacific Labour Mobility Scheme which brings thousands of workers from the region to Australia for temporary work, although the Opposition has signalled it might scrap the ALP's changes to the scheme \u2014 including a requirement to give workers minimum weekly hours.\n\nBoth Labor and the Coalition support the Pacific Labour Mobility Scheme, but disagree on recent changes to the program. (ABC News: Lucy Cooper)\n\nThe Coalition has also flagged that it will review \u2014 or possibly cut \u2014 the federal government's Pacific Engagement Visa which will bring 3,000 people from the region to Australia permanently.\n\nFew people the ABC spoke to also raised climate change, a subject that inevitably comes up in any extended conversation about Australia with Pacific leaders or officials.\n\nHow anxieties about national security could shape the election outcome Photo shows Anthony Albanese, wearing a colourful shirt and shell necklace, speaks to people off-camera. With Australian voters facing an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world, both Labor and the Coalition are trying to burnish their national security credentials.\n\nThe Albanese government says unlike the Coalition it has made serious attempts to cut Australia's emissions, and has promised to co-host a major Conference of the Parties meeting on climate with the Pacific in 2026.\n\nBut Dr Viliamu Iese from the Oceania Institute at the University of Melbourne told the ABC that Pacific leaders and citizens should be aware that both major parties have backed the expansion of coal and gas projects \u2014 which flies in the face of its commitments to the Pacific.\n\n\"We all know that Australia does contribute a lot in the emission of greenhouse gases, not only in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"They also export a lot of other coal and also natural gas that are emitted by other countries. Australia is contributing enormously to the emission of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nWhatever the outcome on Saturday, that's a discussion which will not die away in the Pacific.",

    "text": "\u201cI didn\u2019t take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden \u2018Overhang.\u2019 This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS.\u201d He\u2019s wrong on both counts. When Trump took office, the sharemarket, after rising more than 90 per cent during Biden\u2019s term, was still booming, partly in expectation of his promised tax cuts and deregulation. It kept rising until mid-February, when Trump announced his plans for \u201cthe Big One,\u201d his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. Since the day of that announcement, it has fallen more than 9 per cent. So it\u2019s definitely Trump\u2019s stock market. There is no Biden overhang, either in markets or the economy, which he handed over to Trump in a healthy state.\n\nLoading That\u2019s actually borne out by the GDP data. If the effects of the trade imbalance are excluded, consumer spending and investment numbers, while slowing, were still quite solid. It was Trump\u2019s tariffs that distorted trade activity and generated the shrinking GDP bottom line. Trump unveiled the detail of his tariffs \u2013 the baseline 10 per cent universal tariff and the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on the 90-odd countries with the biggest trade surpluses with the US (whose implementation was subsequently paused for 90 days after the financial markets\u2019 shocked reaction) \u2013 on \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d or April 2, which was after the end of the March quarter. When the June quarter numbers are available, the big bulge in inventories and equipment spending from the March quarter ought to have shrunk significantly, and the trade balance narrowed somewhat because of the universal tariffs and the 145 per cent tariff on imports from China. Already, US West Coast port authorities are reporting massive falls in container volumes. Once the second-quarter data comes out, the ongoing effects of the tariffs on consumer spending and business investment will be clearer. They are unlikely to be positive.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump told a rally of supporters in Michigan that \u201cinflation is basically down and interest rates came down despite the fact that I have a Fed person [Federal Reserve Board chairman Jerome Powell] who\u2019s not really doing a good job.\u201d Trump\u2019s verbal attacks on Powell and the Fed\u2019s credibility and independence have been another factor in the sharemarket\u2019s fall. Along with the trade data, the US Commerce Department also released inflation data for March, which showed a slight \u2013 0.1 percentage point \u2013 drop in the headline inflation rate to 2.4 per cent. That would normally be good news, except that the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation had yet to flow through to companies\u2019 profit margins or consumer prices in March. When it does, it will push up the inflation rate, reduce consumer spending, slow the growth of the underlying economy and could even lead to a recession. That combination of economic contraction and higher inflation \u2013 stagflation \u2013 would be the worst-case economic outcome for America from Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\nThe first-quarter data does underscore how significantly even the prospect of Trump\u2019s tariffs has distorted business and consumer behaviour. Trump has downplayed the effect of higher prices and shortages of goods that will flow from the tariffs on China alone. \u201cWell, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally,\u201d he said after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The tariffs, of course, will apply to a lot more goods than dolls. Their cost will feed into the cost bases of most businesses and will be passed on, almost entirely, to consumers, if the history of tariffs is any guide. They are effectively a highly regressive form of tax on consumption. In some instances - probably in many, given how reliant the US is on imports, particularly from China - there will be empty shelves because either Chinese exporters see no profit in trying to sell products with a 145 per cent tariff attached, or they\u2019ve gone out of business.\n\nLoading Both the US and China are being damaged even in this early phase of the trade war, with surveys of manufacturers in both countries showing reduced activity and slumps in both business and consumer confidence. In the US, consumer confidence is near five-year lows, according to a Conference Board survey released this week. That\u2019s the lowest since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump can try to blame Biden for what\u2019s now occurring, but it is his trade policies \u2013 what the Wall Street Journal dubbed \u201cthe dumbest trade war in history\u201d \u2013 and an overlay of Musk\u2019s crude assault on government agencies that have driven the sea-change in sentiment, behaviour and costs within the US economy. They are driving the world\u2019s biggest economy towards the proverbial cliff - and it\u2019s all on him.",

And I think from watching those, it\u2019s deterred me away from him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnthony Albanese, I suppose, has tried to save the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Marlee Conlan, 29, a high school music teacher from Woodend in the Victorian electorate of McEwen, the decision is just as complicated. Like many others, she\u2019s uninspired by the two major parties. \u201cI\u2019ve just kind of lost faith in the big two parties. I\u2019m probably aiming for a hung parliament, if anything, because ... if I had to choose from the big two, I\u2019d definitely be leading towards Labor, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the best option, to be honest,\u201d she said. Marlee Conlan, 29, is a high school music teacher from Woodend in the electorate of McEwen. She was always leaning towards a minor party or independent and has decided to vote for the Legalise Cannabis Party. Credit: Justin McManus \u201cI\u2019m putting Legalise Cannabis Party first, not necessarily because of the legalise cannabis [aspect], but like, literally everything else ... cost of living, housing, energy, education, climate, health, integrity.\u201d Conlan\u2019s sentiment reflects the broader trend in electorates across the country where voters are searching for alternatives that align with personal values and the pressing concerns of everyday Australians.\n\nMeanwhile in Tuesday\u2019s latest Resolve Political Monitor conducted for this masthead by Resolve Strategic, Australians have given Labor a clear lead over the Coalition putting the government ahead by 53 to 47 per cent in two-party terms despite new signs of pressure on its primary vote. The exclusive results show that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has cemented his lead over Dutton as preferred prime minister \u2013 ahead by 47 to 31 per cent \u2013 in a dramatic turnaround from surveys in January and February showing that voters had swung to the opposition leader. The results show that support for the Greens has risen 1 percentage point to 14 per cent and Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation has risen by the same amount to 7 per cent. Support for independent candidates has fallen in national terms since the last Resolve survey two weeks ago, but it is stronger in NSW, Victoria and Queensland when compared with surveys taken at the last election. The undecided voters we interviewed were recruited and provided an incentive through Resolve Strategic. They were screened to ensure they lived in the seats that could help decide the 2025 election outcome, were not fully committed in their vote choice, and did not work in an occupation that would give them special insight into the election. Here\u2019s what they said.\n\nAnna Deakin, 22 Anna Deakin, 22 lives in Queensland\u2019s Griffith electorate. Griffith electorate in Queensland, nursing assistant, student and retail worker. Voting stance: Voted early, preferencing the Greens. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to see the ads change with the Liberal campaign. I\u2019ve seen a lot more to do with the cost of living and bringing fuel prices down, when previously \u2026 I hadn\u2019t seen any of that. I ended up doing it [voting] early, the other day \u2026 I feel like there has been an exponential increase in the number of campaigners outside of the voting centres, which was really interesting to see.\u201d\n\nScott Reeves, 59 Scott Reeves, 50, lives in the seat of Robertson in NSW. Lives in Kariong in the electorate of Robertson, NSW. TAFE teacher, home owner and lives with partner and adult children. Voting stance: Undecided at the start of the campaign, and is considering an independent candidate or Labor. \u201c[Peter Dutton] came out and made two fairly significant policy statements and then backed out of them completely \u2026 if you\u2019ve had four years to prepare for an election, it doesn\u2019t fill you full of confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve both come out with very similar takes on housing. Having worked in that industry for most of my life \u2026 we don\u2019t have the ability to meet any of the targets either party are talking about. There\u2019s just not enough tradesmen. \u201cI\u2019d rather see [tax] go to some purpose, rather than give it back to me. If you don\u2019t want it, then don\u2019t tax me. But if you\u2019re going to tax me, then use it. Use it for something that benefits my kids, my grandkids, my great-grandkids in the future.\u201d Steven Kater, 63 Lives in Bondi in NSW\u2019s Wentworth electorate, business owner, single. Voting stance: formerly Liberal voter, will preference One Nation, then Liberal.\n\n\u201cI still like \u2026 Pauline Hanson. I haven\u2019t changed in that view. Because I just think these people are Australians. They seem like they know what\u2019s going on \u2026 whoever gets in, they\u2019ll pressurise them to be very careful of normal Australian people. Steven Kater will be voting for One Nation. \u201cIt could be a hung parliament. And what I\u2019m worried about, and it did come out of when I was watching the [leaders\u2019] debate \u2026 Mr Dutton did say to Mr Albanese, \u2018Will the Greens give you the first vote?\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m worried about small business, with the tax cuts \u2026 I would have liked to see talk ... about Israel and Gaza, what they\u2019re going to do there because that\u2019s still very [important] and Ukraine too.\u201d Tony Cheng, 48\n\nBrisbane, Queensland, Lives in Summer Hill, lawyer, single (mortgage-holder), shares home with parents. Tony Cheng, 48, is still undecided. \u201cThere\u2019s time. I\u2019ll just go in and look a bit closer at what their policy platforms are, and maybe make a judgment on that.\u201d Voting stance: still undecided. \u201cThe promises of the election platforms and commitments they were putting out there \u2026 if you\u2019re really stuck in that middle \u2013 that\u2019s probably popping the whole thing up \u2013 you\u2019re not really getting much from it \u2026 other than the fuel excise, I suppose. It\u2019s not like in the last six months [Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton] suddenly stepped up to become a person that we don\u2019t know they are \u2026 their presentation and the level of confidence that they instil in all of us that hasn\u2019t changed. I might as well flip a coin on the day. There\u2019s news in the lead up, so there\u2019s time. I\u2019ll just go in and look a bit closer at what their policy platforms are, and maybe make a judgment on that.\u201d Kenneth Ralston, 31\n\nKenneth Ralston has not changed his mind and will be voting Liberal. Lives in Berwick in the Victorian electorate of Bruce. Is single and is a car parts salesman. Voting status: Likely Liberal voter, which he has always leant towards. \u201cI still sort of feel leaning towards Liberal, but I do feel Liberals maybe made a bit of a mess of it since we probably last spoke a few weeks ago ... and I feel a bit stuck with it. You\u2019re not going to fix everything by spending more and overspending ... you\u2019re not going to get anywhere. You need to cut it. You need to reduce it.\u201d Adrian Hill, 50\n\nLives in Croydon North in the Victorian electorate of Deakin, is a technical manager for a chemical manufacturing company. Adrian Hill will be voting for an independent in his electorate of Deakin in Victoria. Voting status: Will vote local independent, after leaning Liberal earlier in the campaign. \u201cIf I was to go for either of the majors, I would have now switched. I would go for Albanese. However, the reality is ... neither of them are getting my vote. I suppose I\u2019ve done a little more research on my local candidate ... Michael Sukkar, and I\u2019ve been less than impressed with him during the course of this election campaign ... and as much as I could easily go for a major or put someone else there, I think an independent is the right thing to do.\u201d George Semertzidis, 57\n\nGeorge Smertzidis says for him the biggest election issues would be housing affordability and the cost of living. Lives in Victoria\u2019s McEwen electorate, is a textiles director, married. Voting stance: Originally keen on independents, is still unsure now. \u201cI want to vote for an independent or the minor parties because we\u2019ve been 15 years in politics without bipartisan support. When it matters we don\u2019t get that bipartisan support and I feel that independents might close that gap and force the major parties to come to the table on issues that are important to the country.\u201d John Nolan, 55\n\nJohn Nolan changed his mind and is voting for Albanese over Dutton. Lives in the Chisholm electorate in Victoria, is a single, warehouse storeman. Voting stance: Originally leaning towards Dutton, has now voted for Albanese. \u201cI really do like strong leaders but I think Albanese\u2019s more calming and I like what he wants to do better than what Dutton wants to do. They\u2019re both good leaders in their own way and I don\u2019t know if Australia\u2019s ready for a change that probably Dutton will give us.\u201d Andy Hannan, 42",

They went overseas and interstate, and tried to remain amicable.\n\nThen, he said, something changed.\n\nSimon recalled that one afternoon in late October or November in 2022, he was dropping off the children when Erin pulled him aside for a private chat.\n\nShe sat in the car with Simon and said she had discovered that his tax return for the previous financial year noted they were separated. \u201cBefore that we hadn\u2019t gotten the government involved in the fact we were separated at all before,\u201d Simon said.\n\n\u201cShe said that mattered, I think, for the Family Tax Benefit, something of that nature.

She was also keen for him to sign a form stipulating that they would each pay half of the children\u2019s school fees.\n\nHowever, Simon told Erin he had been advised by child support staff not to do so, as the school fees would be covered in the child support payments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she was very upset about that,\u201d Simon told the jury.",

    "text": "The most common version, illustrated by a wind turbine in flames, reads in part: \u201cA two-megawatt windmill is made up of 260 tonnes of steel that required 300 tonnes or [sic] iron ore and 170 tonnes of coking coal, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons.\u201d An aerial view of wind turbines in Port Augusta, South Australia. Credit: Getty Images It goes on: \u201cA windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.\u201d The claim is intended to discredit wind power altogether.\n\nHowever, it comes from a partial quote from geoscientist David Hughes, writing in 2009 about so-called energy or carbon payback \u2013 how long it takes for a turbine to offset the amount of carbon emissions used in its creation. His full quote read: \u201cThe question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less; in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is, a windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.\u201d Loading Hughes has told Reuters that his comments were taken out of context and were intended to show that not every location was suitable. Since 2009, technology has improved markedly. The federal energy department says the carbon payback time for an offshore wind turbine is now five to 12 months into a 30-year lifespan, and between 85 and 94 per cent of its weight can be recycled. Various studies put the payback for onshore wind at four to six months.\n\nSimilarly, electric vehicles are emissions intensive at first because of the embedded carbon in their batteries. The average payback time is about 41,000km of driving, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF) says, and their lifespan in 2024 was about 250,000km. Payback can be expected to shrink further as technology improves. Myth: There\u2019s no point in acting until China does This has been a popular line for sceptics of climate action for a decade at least, and it seems to make sense \u2013 China overtook the US as the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitter in 2006, and it now builds more coal-fired power plants than the rest of the world put together. But there is more to the story.\n\nLoading China is determined to achieve energy independence, and since it imports 60 per cent of its oil and 55 per cent of its coal, it is building a new energy system at high speed to wean itself off foreign energy sources. \u201cFor every coal plant they build, they build six wind and solar projects, and they build a battery project, and they build a nuclear project,\u201d says energy analyst Tim Buckley. A massive solar and wind farm near Weifang, China. Credit: AP Last year China accounted for about 45 per cent of the world\u2019s solar installations, 65 per cent of the world\u2019s wind installations and 60 per cent of the world\u2019s battery energy storage systems.\n\nAs a result, it is likely that China hit peak emissions last year, or will do so this year, five years ahead of target. Even without its high-speed transformation, China is not the world\u2019s singular climate villain. It might be the biggest overall emitter, but per person China creates 8.89 tonnes of greenhouse pollution a year \u2013 much less than both Australia (15 tonnes) and the US (17.7 tonnes). In a speech last week, apparently made with an eye on the climate policies of US President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, \u201cHowever the world may change, China will not slow down its climate actions, will not reduce its support for international co-operation, and will not cease its efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.\u201d Myth: We need nuclear for baseload power\n\nWhatever the case for nuclear energy \u2013 and it is a case that is at best contested \u2013 the need for baseload power is not it. In the Ipsos survey, 50 per cent of Australians believe that \u201cbuilding more renewable energy generation will lead to more blackouts and brownouts\u201d. Advocates for nuclear power claim that it will provide necessary baseload power for \u201cwhen the sun doesn\u2019t shine and the wind doesn\u2019t blow\u201d. Protesters at Peter Dutton\u2019s cancelled announcement were wearing hazmat suits and measuring out spots for a potential nuclear reactor. Credit: James Brickwood But the very notion of \u201cbaseload power\u201d is old-fashioned, says Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University. He says the idea was born during the creation of the first huge coal-fired power plants in France and England in the 1930s.\n\nSince the machines \u2013 like Australia\u2019s ageing coal fleet \u2013 could not be turned up or down to meet demand, excess capacity had to be built into the system. Modern grid technology is built to closely meet peaks and troughs in demand with variable renewables coming from various sources, backed by batteries, pumped hydro and gas. The Australian Energy Market Operator predicts that reliability is likely to be maintained over the coming years as long as investment in renewable energy is adequate. Myth: Offshore wind farms cause harm to whales The claim that offshore wind turbines harm or even kill whales is quite simply wrong, and there is credible research that suggests it is misinformation deliberately spread by fossil fuel interests.\n\nThe claim \u2013 which half of survey respondents found believable \u2013 has been thoroughly debunked by scientists. A humpback whale breaching off K\u2019gari, formerly known as Fraser Island, in Queensland. In fact, as reported by this masthead, whales swim around obstacles such as wind turbines. What about other species? Wind turbines in general \u2013 both offshore and onshore \u2013 can kill birds, though much less than traditional energy production, high-rise buildings, or cats, and there are solutions such as painting one blade black. Offshore wind infrastructure can benefit fish by creating an artificial reef. Myth: Floating wind turbines are novel, unproven technology\n\nThe federal government has declared six offshore wind zones around Australia. In some locations \u2013 including the Illawarra and Hunter coasts in NSW \u2013 the proposal is to use floating turbines in deeper water. A common criticism is that this has never been done before and is unlikely to work. Globally, most offshore wind development to date consists of turbines fixed to the seabed floor. However, that does not mean the engineering challenges of floating turbines are new. Associate Professor Michelle Voyer from the University of Wollongong and the Australian Centre for Offshore Wind Energy, says the offshore oil and gas industry has used floating infrastructure for years.\n\nLoading Floating offshore wind farms are already being built overseas, including in Scotland and Norway, she adds. Voyer says Australia is at least seven years away from constructing floating turbines and will be able to learn from overseas experience. \u201cThe companies involved are going to be doing a lot of work around questions of feasibility,\u201d she said.

Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nOften referred to as the \u201cBarbie drug\u201d or \u201cvacation peptide\u201d, melanotan has been growing in popularity and prevalence, largely thanks to social media, where it has been promoted.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to maintain that \u201csummer glow\u201d as we head into winter, you may have come across a slew of products on social media promising to give you a \u201cnatural\u201d tan.\n\nMelanotans \u2013 often listed as melanotan I or melanotan II \u2013 are synthetic peptides that mimic the skin\u2019s natural production of melanin when exposed to the sun.\n\nDr Katherine Armour, a dermatologist and founder of Bespoke Skin Technology in Melbourne, explains that melanotan I, or afamelanotide, \u201cis a licensed medication used to treat a rare, inherited photosensitivity disorder called erythropoietic protoporphyria. Part of the protection afforded by this drug in treated patients is via its effects in tanning the skin.\u201d\n\nMelanotan I is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia to treat this skin condition. Melanotan II, on the other hand, is what you\u2019ll find in most of these tanning products online. The ingredient can also cause prolonged erections, and so can be found in some erectile dysfunction drugs.\n\nMelanotan II is not approved by the TGA for use as a tanning agent and is illegal to sell and promote in Australia.\n\nThese tanning agents appear in various forms, including nasal sprays, tablets, injections and creams. In marketing, products containing melanotan are sometimes more obliquely referred to as \u201cpeptide tanners\u201d, \u201ctan boosters\u201d, or \u201cnatural tan accelerators\u201d.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last election, talk of First Nations affairs was everywhere \u2013 with Labor\u2019s campaign featuring the promised implementation of the reforms described in the Uluru Statement from the Heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step was Voice, a constitutionally enshrined advisory body on First Nations affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Labor did keep their promise to hold the referendum, it was defeated in late 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, the major parties have taken a different approach to addressing First Nations affairs in their election campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been completely absent from any of the campaigning from both sides of the major parties, and that\u2019s quite deliberate. They\u2019re both steering away from it because they don\u2019t want the failure of the referendum tarnishing any of their potential chances. Labor has seemingly walked away from the Uluru Statement from the Heart, there\u2019s been no mention of Truth or Treaty. The Coalition\u2019s response, there has been an assumption that the Australian public does not support Indigenous rights.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s Dr Bartholomew Stanford, a Torres Strait Islander man from Masig Island and senior lecturer in Indigenous Studies at James Cook University.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has pivoted to economic policies, preferencing reforms for programs to increase employment and Commonwealth procurement, funding for First Nations environmental ranger programs and general policy, such as an increase in urgent care clinics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s core Indigenous policy is a promise to audit Indigenous expenditure, and address what they call 'wasteful spending'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have created a new role for \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d, reflecting moves by the Trump administration in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Stanford believes both sides of government have failed to address key issues affecting First Nations people and fulfilling Indigenous rights \u2013 including not implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s falling well behind other settler nations and is not meeting basic international standards, which is really undermining any genuine attempts at reconciliation in our country while also tearing at the fabric of Australia\u2019s national identity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tensions can make election time stressful for First Nations communities and community-controlled organisations, says Catherine Liddle, CEO of SNAICC - a leading organisation for First Nations children and families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we are interested in is policies that make a difference, policies that show that governments are actually doing what they need to do and that is listening to communities. We know that come election times, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people it\u2019s often a really anxious time because we know that the conversations and policies often become a quick race to the bottom.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Nations communities experience distinct challenges that are often overlooked by policy, as reflected in the reporting from Closing the Gap - which does find that only four out of 19 targets are on track (SNAICC 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's yet another source of frustration and anxiety for First Nations voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the Australian Electoral Commission has started to send out mobile polling teams, who go to almost 500 remote communities across Australia \u2013 many are First Nations communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of these communities is Pirlangimpi, in the Tiwi Islands at the top of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many remote communities, they face challenges such as over-crowded housing, limited access to health services, and badly maintained infrastructure like roads.\n\n\n\n\n\nNITV\u2019s Josh Van Staden travelled to the Tiwis to look into the issues for these communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe spoke to community members who still advocate for voting.\n\n\n\n\n\nVox 1 \u201cBut it\u2019s good for us to vote, because then we can hear about what\u2019s going on...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVox 2 \"What is going to happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVox 3 \"What needs to be done and ...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVox 1 \"Yeah what needs to be done.\u201d ]]\n\n\n\n\n\nPirlangimpi sits in the seat of Lingiari, an electorate named after a trailblazer for Indigenous land rights \u2013 Vincent Lingiari.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an electorate that spans the majority of the Northern Territory, it is also the electorate with the highest proportion of First Nations voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seat is currently held by Marion Scrymgour, a Tiwi and Anmatjere woman and Labor member.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen interviewed by Karla Grant for NITV\u2019s Living Black this month, Ms Scrymgour said her constituents were devastated by the result of the referendum and would advocate for Truth and Treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\nMS: \u201cAnd they wanted to be able to say to governments 'let us drive this policy debate and let us be able to make the decisions and to work with the government to get better outcomes for our communities'.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKG: \u201cSo what do you say that a re-elected government should do about Treaty and Truth-telling?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMS: \u201cY\u2019know Karla it\u2019s not up to me to say as a re-elected government but certainly as a re-elected member in Lingiari, I will do everything I can as the local member to elevate those voices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Dr Stanford welcomes the support for Truth and Treaty from Ms Scrymgour, he also cautions voters to consider whether parties are likely to support the values of their local members when it comes to First Nations Affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also says this same critical thinking should be applied to voting for minor party and independent candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Liddle also provides some advice for voters for election day and into the next term of parliament.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The United States economy unexpectedly contracted in the first three months of the year on an import surge triggered by Donald Trump's tariff plans, although the president pinned the blame squarely on his predecessor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sharp increase in imports was a reflection of businesses and consumers stockpiling foreign goods to get ahead of Trump's sweeping trade levies, which went into effect earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three major Wall Street indices fell on the economic news, before paring losses to close mixed, while oil prices extended their losses.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a cabinet meeting in Washington, Trump insisted the growth downturn was the legacy of former president Joe Biden's policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's Biden, that's not Trump,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStriking a more positive tone, he highlighted the \"whopping\" 22 per cent rise in gross domestic investment during the first quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual economic growth stayed above 2 per cent in every year of Biden's presidency, reaching 2.8 per cent in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the world's largest economy decreased at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent in the first quarter, after growing 2.4 per cent in the final months of 2024, according to the estimate from the US commerce department.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was sharply below the market consensus estimate of 0.4 per cent growth, according to Briefing.com, and marked the first quarterly contraction since 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commerce department said in a statement the contraction was in large part down to an \"upturn in imports,\" aided by a decline in consumer and government spending.\n\n\n\nA 'blaring warning'\n\nIn a statement, the White House called GDP a \"backward-looking indicator\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"It's no surprise the leftovers of Biden's economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GDP figures were published on the 101st day since Trump returned to White House, along with fresh data showing a slowdown in the US Federal Reserve's favoured inflation gauge last month.\n\n\n\nThe US economy has unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter, after a surge in imports. Source: ABACA / Pool/PA Trump's introduction of sweeping tariffs against most countries sparked a selloff in financial markets, sending volatility to levels not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement: \"This decline in GDP is a blaring warning to everyone that Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans' failed MAGA experiment is killing our economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the dramatic market movements in early April, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on the higher tariffs for dozens of countries to allow for trade talks, while maintaining a baseline 10 per cent rate for most countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the administration has also added to the tariffs on China, with the level of duties introduced since January now totalling 145 per cent \u2014 with some sector-specific measures pushing levies even higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina has responded with its own steep, targeted measures against US goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump said China was getting \"hammered\" by the tariffs, and said he still hoped to make a deal with China, whom he referred to as \"the leading candidate for the chief ripper-offer\" of America.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" Trump said, arguing that the US did not need many of the things China produced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists at the US financial services firm Wells Fargo wrote in an investor note the US economy is at a greater risk of recession now than a month ago, \"but this 0.3 per cent contraction in Q1 GDP is not the start of one\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It reflects instead the sudden change in trade policy that culminated in the biggest drag from net exports in data going back more than a half-century.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "When Eduardo Caceres-Sandoval was growing up in Perth, he recalls actively discussing the 2016 US election in primary school \u2014 but little was mentioned about the Australian election of the same year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this, the Chilean Australian went on to study Asia-Pacific security studies in Canberra, partly because his parents encouraged him to read books about Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a teenager, it kind of made me realise the world is moving \u2026 it's moving away from Europe and US, it's moving toward Asia,\" says the 20-year-old university student.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaceres-Sandoval is among a growing number of gen Z Australians concerned about Australia's interactions with the world, particularly following the trade disputes between Australia and the US .\n\n\n\n\n\nPolls have shown that scepticism about the US relationship is most common among Australia's diverse communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2018, polls run by the Lowy Institute have consistently shown that Australians who had at least one parent born in an Asian country have lower trust in the United States, compared to those whose parents were both born in Australia.\n\n\n\nEduardo Caceres-Sandoval says his Chilean Australian parents encouraged him to read about the Asia-Pacific region when growing up. Credit: Supplied In addition, a lower proportion of them find the alliance with the US important for Australia's security.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese perspectives could become more important as Australia's diversity continues to grow. Around 31.5 per cent of Australia's population was born overseas , according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures from 2023. This is up from 17.7 per cent in 1911.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-time voter Ria Verma, 19, says her Indian parents' migration journey to Australia two decades ago has \"complicated\" her opinion on the Australia-US alliance. She is also concerned that both the US and Australia want to cut migration numbers .\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Verma and Caceres-Sandoval want to see Australia's foreign policy become more independent, while maintaining the existing alliance with the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's already happening, but I would like Australia to just go all-in in terms of engaging with its Asian counterparts,\" Caceres-Sandoval says.\n\n\n\nRia Verma says immigration has been a life changing opportunity for many people, including her parents. Credit: Supplied\n\nNuanced shift of views on US between generations\n\nThere is generally a bipartisan approach to foreign and defence affairs in Australia, so the issue has had limited influence on voters in elections \u2014 only 5 per cent considered it the most important issue in the last election, according to the Australian Electoral Study in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that could change at this year's election . The ABC's Vote Compass tool shows an increase in voters nominating foreign affairs as a voting priority compared to the 2022 election. The issue resonates most among voters aged 18 to 29.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Donald Trump's higher tariffs on nearly 60 countries kick in as global trade war deepens\n\nNineteen-year-old Canberra voter Regina Ng, who hopes to pursue a career in foreign policy, says the subject is among the top issues for her when considering her vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think foreign policy would be one of the highest things that I would rank in terms of how I view the election,\" says Ng, who studies international relations at the Australian National University.\n\n\n\nRegina Ng says foreign policy is among the top issues she'll be looking at in deciding her vote. Credit: Supplied Dylan Rafel Adams, a 19-year-old Greek Australian student, will be casting his first vote at a federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe tells SBS News that he and his peers are \"more aware\" of the Australia-US relationship than their parents' generation.\n\n\n\nI feel that our generation have grown up with the US and the influence of the United States, their popular culture, basically every aspect of their social life is integrated into our Australian cultural upbringing.\n\nAdams says he's been an advocate for the Australia-US alliance in the past few years, but the new Trump administration made him \"start to question the alliance\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut still, Adams says he's not \"against\" the alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm still supportive of our alliance [with the US], and we can look at AUKUS and a lot of scientific developments that our nations make together \u2014 regardless of who\u2019s the president of the US,\" he said pointing to the security partnership that will see Australia buy nuclear submarines from the US.\n\n\n\nDylan Rafel Adams says he considers national security as the most important election issue when considering who he will vote for. Credit: Supplied Adams' views on the US appear to mirror the dynamics of how gen Z Australians see the Australia-US relationship \u2014 they remain supportive but sceptical about the partnership \u2014 according to the Lowy Institute poll in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the trade disputes, the poll shows the majority of Australians still find the Australia-US alliance important for Australia\u2019s security, with only 4 per cent considering it \"not at all important\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there is a generational gap \u2014 while 61 per cent of Australians aged 60 and above considered Australia\u2019s alliance with the US \"very important\", only 41 per cent of people aged 18 to 29 considered it so.\n\n\n\nGenerational divide when it comes to trust\n\nRyan Neelam, director of the Lowy Institute's public opinion and foreign policy program, says there has also been a dramatic drop in trust in the US among Australians aged 60 and above.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, 72 per cent had \"a great deal of trust\" in the US, but this dropped dramatically to 39 per cent in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong Australians aged 18 to 29, trust in the US fell by a smaller margin (just 4 percentage points) but they were already at relatively low levels, and this group has reported the lowest level of trust among all age groups since 2018.\n\n\n\nThe age divide can also be seen in differing views about US President Donald Trump's demand that US allies increase defence spending .\n\n\n\n\n\nThirty-nine per cent of Australians aged 18 to 29 approved, compared with 61 per cent of those aged 60 and above who endorsed the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lowy poll also shows Australians aged 18 to 29 have the highest level of trust in Anthony Albanese's competence at handling foreign policy (54 per cent), but the lowest trust in Peter Dutton (11 per cent), compared to other age groups.\n\n\n\nPlans could 'hurt' young people\n\nSarah Ramantanis, who is the chief executive of the not-for-profit Young Australians in International Affairs, says young Australians are increasingly questioning how the strategic and trade relationships with the US could affect their job security and other economic prospects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example \u2026 Trump's tariff policy naturally encourages an increase in domestic production within the US, [which means] less aluminium production and subsequent jobs within the sector in Australia,\" Ramantanis tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the war in Gaza has also led to \"a significant shift\" among young Australians as they lose respect for the US, while Trump's withdrawal from the international climate agreement makes young people more concerned about climate change.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Climate Wars (Revisited): Party Time Ep 3 SBS News 17/04/2025 26:41 Play\n\nThere is also concern about the Coalition's election pledge to increase Australia\u2019s defence spending to 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says the funding boost will help Australia maintain its relationship with allies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdams says while it's \"essential\" for Australia to increase defence funding amid an \"unstable global environment with increasing tensions\", he's worried the Coalition's plan could hurt young people.\n\n\n\nWhen food is expensive, wait times for doctors are long and universities are seeing mass course cuts, it scares me that the Coalition is willing to spend more money on defence than they would on health or education.\n\nCaceres-Sandoval also believes it's necessary to enhance Australia's defence capabilities, but he is concerned the military spending could be complicated, amid the current US-Australia trade tensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If 3 per cent of our GDP is going to the American military industrial complex, will we have good will and security guarantees in exchange?\" he asks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As an Australian voter, I want honesty.\"\n\n\n\nCuts to public service raise fears about career pathways\n\nSeveral young voters who are prioritising foreign policy in this election tell SBS News that they would like to pursue a career in the field, but say the cost of living crisis and intense job competition within the sector may turn them off.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, a major pathway for graduates to become diplomats has been through joining the public service.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ramantanis says many young Australians now have their eyes on overseas international relations organisations.\n\n\n\nI think a lot of youth lose sight of hope that working within government is going to be the way to create sustainable change \u2014 just given the current climate of inconsistent leadership and fear for the upcoming election in Australia and overseas as well.\n\nSome tell SBS News they are worried the Coalition's proposal to cut 41,000 public jobs over five years would mean fewer job opportunities when they graduate.\n\n\n\n\n\nRamantanis hopes the upcoming government will continue to support youth initiatives such as the New Colombo Plan, a scholarship program run by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to support university students to study in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also wants to see if the next government can help open up more jobs in the international relations sector that \"align with young people's values, like sustainability technology or international affairs alike\".\n\n\n\nAnd for those who\u2019ve already worked in the sector, they hope the upcoming election will see more culturally diverse Australians represented in the parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think I would like to see more Asian Australians in the public discourse,\" says Caroline Wang, a Sydney-based China analyst in her early 30s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would love to see more diversity in the foreign policy debate and national conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would do ourselves a massive favour by bringing diversity into the public debate, especially [those] who have cultural and linguistic knowledge and can inform the debate with their experiences and their lens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and

I couldn't commute full time into the office. So if it was mandated and I would have to look for other options.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a solo parent - her commute takes up tosix hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says making the trip more than once a week would blow out her budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It starts to easily go over $100, $150, quite easily, in the one day. So, if we're starting to come into the office, three or four times a week. That's a lot of extra money that I currently don't have in my budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe topic of working from home has become a point of contention, with the coalition vowing to bring public servants back to the office full time, if it won government, before quickly backflipping.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a policy proposal federal Opposition Leader Peter Dutton now admits was a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"Will you be asking for forgiveness from female voters?\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"I think I am today. Look, I think we've made a mistake in relation to this policy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, some major companies, both here and overseas, are making similar moves to ban or restrict working from home arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional services company P-w-C, told British Parliament it's prepared to respond if staff refuse to return for at least three days a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief People Officer at professional services giant PwC, Phillippa O'Connor, says disciplinary action would be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is as with any other employment policy something that we would look to follow through to disciplinary action if that were required. And I think we feel that that's actually important for the very minority of population that are not in compliance to deliver on that fairness agenda.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, flexible working arrangements don't seem to be going away, with more than one-third of Australians still regularly working from home.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Committee for Economic Development of Australia [[CEDA]] says those employees are able to work nearly 20 per cent more hours than those in the office.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also found flexible working arrangements have increased workplace participation by more than 4 per cent post COVID - especially for primary carers, people with disability, and single parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEDA Economist James Brooks says it broadens job opportunities for people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The likelihood that they're in a job at all has actually increased so this is a function of a tight labour market and demand for workers, but its hard to ignore that working from home has given more people opportunities. So they're able to find more jobs which are suited to them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates for flexible working arrangements also say there are ways to ensure productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nGavin Shipman is the Vice President of Teleperformance Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says both employers and employees can find solutions to ensure working from home does not impact productivity levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it\u2019s important that organisations put the right technologies, solutions and processes in place, to make sure employees feel that they\u2019re actually achieving when they are working from home.

Bellamy also offered to remove the disputed recipes from future editions of her cookbook to avoid further conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I did not plagiarise any recipes in my book which consists of 100 recipes I have created over many years, since falling in love with baking as a child and growing up baking with my mum in our home kitchen,\" she wrote on her Instagram stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I immediately offered to remove both recipes from future reprints to prevent further aggravation, which was communicated to Nagi swiftly through discussions.\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram / @brookibakehouse Source: Instagram / @brookibakehouse The situation intensified on Wednesday when the United States-based food blogger Sally McKenney also accused Bellamy of copying her vanilla cake recipe, which she said was originally published in 2019.\n\n\n\nLegal and ethical implications\n\nIn her statement, Maehashi said: \"Profiting from plagiarised recipes is unethical, even if it is not copyright infringement, and undermines the integrity of the entire book.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Matthew Rimmer, a professor in intellectual property and innovation law at the Queensland University of Technology, said in Australia, copyright law does not protect the idea of a recipe itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is about what's called the 'knockoff economy', which is a wide range of different areas in which usual intellectual property norms don't really operate. For example, standup comedy as well as cooking recipes,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been quite a bit of academic discussion as well in terms of areas that do not fairly fit squarely within fields of intellectual property. This case would be one of them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRimmer said allegations of 'plagiarism' don't typically apply to recipes, as the concept is most commonly associated with literary works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not everything is going to be able to be protected by copyright. So you're going to have to think about other regimes of intellectual property. In this instance, I think this is more of a question of 'passing off' or consumer law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If someone has a substantial identity, someone else can't pass off that and misappropriate their business reputation, but that is something that would need to be proven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maybe there is a claim that is also being made there that there's some sort of misleading and deceptive conduct, but that's going to be difficult to prove on the basis of a couple of standard recipes.\"\n\n\n\n",

Goods inflation is up. So the warning signs are here that inflation - as we've seen historically. When you've had a surge of it, the risk is that it comes back again.

It's darling. Darling. It's me, darling. Where are you? You just got out. My phone died, darling. Well, where are you calling from darling? A chance to pay phone, darling. They take your titanium card. No, darling. Oh darling. Even better. They're free darling.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's from a social media ad promoting public pay phones.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were once on almost every street corner in every suburb and town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can remember because it's my hometown, when that was a red box in that location and certainly dropping the coins in it, it has been in that location for a long time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Phil Constable who runs a hardware shop in the New South Wales town of Narooma .\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most people consider pay phones a retro relic from the past, they continue to play an important role in the lives of many Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires they provided an important link with the outside world when mobile services were down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was the only port of, how should I say, external communication. At the time of our bushfires, when the town was out of power for three, three and a half days, there was no mobile phone communication. We couldn't, in our business serve customers by POSTPONE and stuff, and when they made the access to the phone free over that landline, the crowds at a time of heavy tourist activity or in patronage in our community were really up and down a block twice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil thinks difficult moments can bring out the best in people.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's what he saw when nearly 1000 calls were made from the public phone after the fires knocked out mobile coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatience and humility he says were on display during those difficult days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was just fantastic and it was so much good faith and humility with the people waiting their turn. It was just terrific.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTelstra wants the public phone in Narooma to receive national landmark status along with two other phones.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne on Melville Road, Brunswick West, Melbourne and another deep in Queenland's Gulf Country.\n\n\n\n\n\nTelstra wants a formal acknowledgment of the three phones for what it says is their cultural and social impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nLandmark status would mean the phones would be added to the National Heritage List as places of outstanding significance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorian Naomi Parry Duncan says the three were chosen for different reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Melbourne's Brunswick West, there's Australia's most called from public phone to crisis support lines. With over 13,000 calls to Lifeline made since calls became free in Narooma on the south coast of New South Wales. During the black summer bush fires, I was actually there and I saw the community rely on their local phone when everything else, including power and mobile coverage, was down and in Doomadgee, in remote Queensland. This local phone remains a vital connection point.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLifeline chief executive Colin Seery says public phones remain a vital safety net for Australians doing it tough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says for some people they're the safest, and in some cases the only way, to reach out, especially if they don't have access to a mobile or feel more comfortable calling from a public space.\n\n\n\n\n\nTelstra's Chief Customer Advocate, Teresa Corbin says in the past year alone, more than 300,000 free calls made from public phones were to crisis support services such as Lifeline and Triple zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since we made all standard national and mobile calls free from public phones in 2021, usage has more than tripled. Last year alone, Aussies made around 25 million free calls including over 300,000 to Triple zero and other crisis support lines.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2021, Telstra says all local and national calls to standard Australian fixed line numbers and mobiles have been free on the nation's 15,000-odd public phones.\n\n\n\n\n\nTelstra is mandated to maintain payphones, even as their use drops in other countries.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\u201cI didn\u2019t take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden \u2018Overhang.\u2019 This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS.\u201d He\u2019s wrong on both counts. When Trump took office, the sharemarket, after rising more than 90 per cent during Biden\u2019s term, was still booming, partly in expectation of his promised tax cuts and deregulation. It kept rising until mid-February, when Trump announced his plans for \u201cthe Big One,\u201d his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. Since the day of that announcement, it has fallen more than 9 per cent. So it\u2019s definitely Trump\u2019s stock market. There is no Biden overhang, either in markets or the economy, which he handed over to Trump in a healthy state.\n\nLoading That\u2019s actually borne out by the GDP data. If the effects of the trade imbalance are excluded, consumer spending and investment numbers, while slowing, were still quite solid. It was Trump\u2019s tariffs that distorted trade activity and generated the shrinking GDP bottom line. Trump unveiled the detail of his tariffs \u2013 the baseline 10 per cent universal tariff and the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on the 90-odd countries with the biggest trade surpluses with the US (whose implementation was subsequently paused for 90 days after the financial markets\u2019 shocked reaction) \u2013 on \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d or April 2, which was after the end of the March quarter. When the June quarter numbers are available, the big bulge in inventories and equipment spending from the March quarter ought to have shrunk significantly, and the trade balance narrowed somewhat because of the universal tariffs and the 145 per cent tariff on imports from China. Already, US West Coast port authorities are reporting massive falls in container volumes. Once the second-quarter data comes out, the ongoing effects of the tariffs on consumer spending and business investment will be clearer. They are unlikely to be positive.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump told a rally of supporters in Michigan that \u201cinflation is basically down and interest rates came down despite the fact that I have a Fed person [Federal Reserve Board chairman Jerome Powell] who\u2019s not really doing a good job.\u201d Trump\u2019s verbal attacks on Powell and the Fed\u2019s credibility and independence have been another factor in the sharemarket\u2019s fall. Along with the trade data, the US Commerce Department also released inflation data for March, which showed a slight \u2013 0.1 percentage point \u2013 drop in the headline inflation rate to 2.4 per cent. That would normally be good news, except that the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation had yet to flow through to companies\u2019 profit margins or consumer prices in March. When it does, it will push up the inflation rate, reduce consumer spending, slow the growth of the underlying economy and could even lead to a recession. That combination of economic contraction and higher inflation \u2013 stagflation \u2013 would be the worst-case economic outcome for America from Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\nThe first-quarter data does underscore how significantly even the prospect of Trump\u2019s tariffs has distorted business and consumer behaviour. Trump has downplayed the effect of higher prices and shortages of goods that will flow from the tariffs on China alone. \u201cWell, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally,\u201d he said after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The tariffs, of course, will apply to a lot more goods than dolls. Their cost will feed into the cost bases of most businesses and will be passed on, almost entirely, to consumers, if the history of tariffs is any guide. They are effectively a highly regressive form of tax on consumption. In some instances - probably in many, given how reliant the US is on imports, particularly from China - there will be empty shelves because either Chinese exporters see no profit in trying to sell products with a 145 per cent tariff attached, or they\u2019ve gone out of business.\n\nLoading Both the US and China are being damaged even in this early phase of the trade war, with surveys of manufacturers in both countries showing reduced activity and slumps in both business and consumer confidence. In the US, consumer confidence is near five-year lows, according to a Conference Board survey released this week. That\u2019s the lowest since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump can try to blame Biden for what\u2019s now occurring, but it is his trade policies \u2013 what the Wall Street Journal dubbed \u201cthe dumbest trade war in history\u201d \u2013 and an overlay of Musk\u2019s crude assault on government agencies that have driven the sea-change in sentiment, behaviour and costs within the US economy. They are driving the world\u2019s biggest economy towards the proverbial cliff - and it\u2019s all on him.",

    "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of just brought me on to the mentality that, well, I don\u2019t actually have to vote for them and I think my vote will be better suited going with a minor, independent party. I\u2019m going to vote for the Greens in this election after all.\u201d Jacquie McLean, 39, lives in the marginal NSW seat of Gilmore. The single parent, who had ruled out voting for Labor, has changed her mind after being unimpressed by Liberal campaign material. Credit: Wolter Peeters Borbas is not alone in reassessing his political allegiances. Across the country, voters are weighing their discontent against practicality as they prepare to cast their ballots. In the marginal seat of Gilmore, 39-year-old social assistance worker Jacquie McLean described the challenges she was facing as a single parent in West Nowra. Initially ruling out Labor due to disappointment with her local MP, she ultimately changed her mind after reviewing campaign materials \u2013 concluding that Labor was the better of two bad options. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s been popping up in the ads is [Peter] Dutton. And I think from watching those, it\u2019s deterred me away from him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnthony Albanese, I suppose, has tried to save the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Marlee Conlan, 29, a high school music teacher from Woodend in the Victorian electorate of McEwen, the decision is just as complicated. Like many others, she\u2019s uninspired by the two major parties. \u201cI\u2019ve just kind of lost faith in the big two parties. I\u2019m probably aiming for a hung parliament, if anything, because ... if I had to choose from the big two, I\u2019d definitely be leading towards Labor, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the best option, to be honest,\u201d she said. Marlee Conlan, 29, is a high school music teacher from Woodend in the electorate of McEwen. She was always leaning towards a minor party or independent and has decided to vote for the Legalise Cannabis Party. Credit: Justin McManus \u201cI\u2019m putting Legalise Cannabis Party first, not necessarily because of the legalise cannabis [aspect], but like, literally everything else ... cost of living, housing, energy, education, climate, health, integrity.\u201d Conlan\u2019s sentiment reflects the broader trend in electorates across the country where voters are searching for alternatives that align with personal values and the pressing concerns of everyday Australians.\n\nMeanwhile in Tuesday\u2019s latest Resolve Political Monitor conducted for this masthead by Resolve Strategic, Australians have given Labor a clear lead over the Coalition putting the government ahead by 53 to 47 per cent in two-party terms despite new signs of pressure on its primary vote. The exclusive results show that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has cemented his lead over Dutton as preferred prime minister \u2013 ahead by 47 to 31 per cent \u2013 in a dramatic turnaround from surveys in January and February showing that voters had swung to the opposition leader. The results show that support for the Greens has risen 1 percentage point to 14 per cent and Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation has risen by the same amount to 7 per cent. Support for independent candidates has fallen in national terms since the last Resolve survey two weeks ago, but it is stronger in NSW, Victoria and Queensland when compared with surveys taken at the last election. The undecided voters we interviewed were recruited and provided an incentive through Resolve Strategic. They were screened to ensure they lived in the seats that could help decide the 2025 election outcome, were not fully committed in their vote choice, and did not work in an occupation that would give them special insight into the election. Here\u2019s what they said.\n\nAnna Deakin, 22 Anna Deakin, 22 lives in Queensland\u2019s Griffith electorate. Griffith electorate in Queensland, nursing assistant, student and retail worker. Voting stance: Voted early, preferencing the Greens. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to see the ads change with the Liberal campaign. I\u2019ve seen a lot more to do with the cost of living and bringing fuel prices down, when previously \u2026 I hadn\u2019t seen any of that. I ended up doing it [voting] early, the other day \u2026 I feel like there has been an exponential increase in the number of campaigners outside of the voting centres, which was really interesting to see.\u201d\n\nScott Reeves, 59 Scott Reeves, 50, lives in the seat of Robertson in NSW. Lives in Kariong in the electorate of Robertson, NSW. TAFE teacher, home owner and lives with partner and adult children. Voting stance: Undecided at the start of the campaign, and is considering an independent candidate or Labor. \u201c[Peter Dutton] came out and made two fairly significant policy statements and then backed out of them completely \u2026 if you\u2019ve had four years to prepare for an election, it doesn\u2019t fill you full of confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve both come out with very similar takes on housing. Having worked in that industry for most of my life \u2026 we don\u2019t have the ability to meet any of the targets either party are talking about. There\u2019s just not enough tradesmen. \u201cI\u2019d rather see [tax] go to some purpose, rather than give it back to me. If you don\u2019t want it, then don\u2019t tax me. But if you\u2019re going to tax me, then use it. Use it for something that benefits my kids, my grandkids, my great-grandkids in the future.\u201d Steven Kater, 63 Lives in Bondi in NSW\u2019s Wentworth electorate, business owner, single. Voting stance: formerly Liberal voter, will preference One Nation, then Liberal.\n\n\u201cI still like \u2026 Pauline Hanson. I haven\u2019t changed in that view. Because I just think these people are Australians. They seem like they know what\u2019s going on \u2026 whoever gets in, they\u2019ll pressurise them to be very careful of normal Australian people. Steven Kater will be voting for One Nation. \u201cIt could be a hung parliament. And what I\u2019m worried about, and it did come out of when I was watching the [leaders\u2019] debate \u2026 Mr Dutton did say to Mr Albanese, \u2018Will the Greens give you the first vote?\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m worried about small business, with the tax cuts \u2026 I would have liked to see talk ... about Israel and Gaza, what they\u2019re going to do there because that\u2019s still very [important] and Ukraine too.\u201d Tony Cheng, 48\n\nBrisbane, Queensland, Lives in Summer Hill, lawyer, single (mortgage-holder), shares home with parents. Tony Cheng, 48, is still undecided. \u201cThere\u2019s time. I\u2019ll just go in and look a bit closer at what their policy platforms are, and maybe make a judgment on that.\u201d Voting stance: still undecided. \u201cThe promises of the election platforms and commitments they were putting out there \u2026 if you\u2019re really stuck in that middle \u2013 that\u2019s probably popping the whole thing up \u2013 you\u2019re not really getting much from it \u2026 other than the fuel excise, I suppose. It\u2019s not like in the last six months [Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton] suddenly stepped up to become a person that we don\u2019t know they are \u2026 their presentation and the level of confidence that they instil in all of us that hasn\u2019t changed. I might as well flip a coin on the day. There\u2019s news in the lead up, so there\u2019s time. I\u2019ll just go in and look a bit closer at what their policy platforms are, and maybe make a judgment on that.\u201d Kenneth Ralston, 31\n\nKenneth Ralston has not changed his mind and will be voting Liberal. Lives in Berwick in the Victorian electorate of Bruce. Is single and is a car parts salesman. Voting status: Likely Liberal voter, which he has always leant towards. \u201cI still sort of feel leaning towards Liberal, but I do feel Liberals maybe made a bit of a mess of it since we probably last spoke a few weeks ago ... and I feel a bit stuck with it. You\u2019re not going to fix everything by spending more and overspending ... you\u2019re not going to get anywhere. You need to cut it. You need to reduce it.\u201d Adrian Hill, 50\n\nLives in Croydon North in the Victorian electorate of Deakin, is a technical manager for a chemical manufacturing company. Adrian Hill will be voting for an independent in his electorate of Deakin in Victoria. Voting status: Will vote local independent, after leaning Liberal earlier in the campaign. \u201cIf I was to go for either of the majors, I would have now switched. I would go for Albanese. However, the reality is ... neither of them are getting my vote. I suppose I\u2019ve done a little more research on my local candidate ... Michael Sukkar, and I\u2019ve been less than impressed with him during the course of this election campaign ... and as much as I could easily go for a major or put someone else there, I think an independent is the right thing to do.\u201d George Semertzidis, 57\n\nGeorge Smertzidis says for him the biggest election issues would be housing affordability and the cost of living. Lives in Victoria\u2019s McEwen electorate, is a textiles director, married. Voting stance: Originally keen on independents, is still unsure now. \u201cI want to vote for an independent or the minor parties because we\u2019ve been 15 years in politics without bipartisan support. When it matters we don\u2019t get that bipartisan support and I feel that independents might close that gap and force the major parties to come to the table on issues that are important to the country.\u201d John Nolan, 55\n\nJohn Nolan changed his mind and is voting for Albanese over Dutton. Lives in the Chisholm electorate in Victoria, is a single, warehouse storeman. Voting stance: Originally leaning towards Dutton, has now voted for Albanese. \u201cI really do like strong leaders but I think Albanese\u2019s more calming and I like what he wants to do better than what Dutton wants to do. They\u2019re both good leaders in their own way and I don\u2019t know if Australia\u2019s ready for a change that probably Dutton will give us.\u201d Andy Hannan, 42",

    "text": "Crying in the dock, Simon Patterson was asked repeatedly if he needed a break. He told the jury that if it was OK, he would like to continue talking about his marriage.\n\nAfter asking for a tissue, he told the court that he and Erin once shared a largely friendly relationship after their separation. Often, they would exchange text messages about politics and other interesting topics.\n\nThey even continued to share family holidays, he said. They went overseas and interstate, and tried to remain amicable.\n\nThen, he said, something changed.\n\nSimon recalled that one afternoon in late October or November in 2022, he was dropping off the children when Erin pulled him aside for a private chat.\n\nShe sat in the car with Simon and said she had discovered that his tax return for the previous financial year noted they were separated. \u201cBefore that we hadn\u2019t gotten the government involved in the fact we were separated at all before,\u201d Simon said.\n\n\u201cShe said that mattered, I think, for the Family Tax Benefit, something of that nature. And so, she would be obliged to claim child support off me, which had never happened before.\u201d\n\nSimon Patterson arrives at court. Credit: Jason South\n\nSimon told the court his tax status was changed as a result of a miscommunication between him and his accountant. He said Erin rejected his efforts to revert it.\n\nFrom then on, Simon said, communication became more functional and less \u201cchatty\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat was probably the first thing that made me feel that there was a substantial change in our relationship, that before that, our habit for years was to message each other a lot, in a chatty way, and the chatty nature of it pretty much stopped,\u201d Simon said.\n\nHe said that a few weeks later, Erin applied for child support. She was also keen for him to sign a form stipulating that they would each pay half of the children\u2019s school fees.\n\nHowever, Simon told Erin he had been advised by child support staff not to do so, as the school fees would be covered in the child support payments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she was very upset about that,\u201d Simon told the jury.",

    "text": "The most common version, illustrated by a wind turbine in flames, reads in part: \u201cA two-megawatt windmill is made up of 260 tonnes of steel that required 300 tonnes or [sic] iron ore and 170 tonnes of coking coal, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons.\u201d An aerial view of wind turbines in Port Augusta, South Australia. Credit: Getty Images It goes on: \u201cA windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.\u201d The claim is intended to discredit wind power altogether.\n\nHowever, it comes from a partial quote from geoscientist David Hughes, writing in 2009 about so-called energy or carbon payback \u2013 how long it takes for a turbine to offset the amount of carbon emissions used in its creation. His full quote read: \u201cThe question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less; in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is, a windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.\u201d Loading Hughes has told Reuters that his comments were taken out of context and were intended to show that not every location was suitable. Since 2009, technology has improved markedly. The federal energy department says the carbon payback time for an offshore wind turbine is now five to 12 months into a 30-year lifespan, and between 85 and 94 per cent of its weight can be recycled. Various studies put the payback for onshore wind at four to six months.\n\nSimilarly, electric vehicles are emissions intensive at first because of the embedded carbon in their batteries. The average payback time is about 41,000km of driving, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF) says, and their lifespan in 2024 was about 250,000km. Payback can be expected to shrink further as technology improves. Myth: There\u2019s no point in acting until China does This has been a popular line for sceptics of climate action for a decade at least, and it seems to make sense \u2013 China overtook the US as the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitter in 2006, and it now builds more coal-fired power plants than the rest of the world put together. But there is more to the story.\n\nLoading China is determined to achieve energy independence, and since it imports 60 per cent of its oil and 55 per cent of its coal, it is building a new energy system at high speed to wean itself off foreign energy sources. \u201cFor every coal plant they build, they build six wind and solar projects, and they build a battery project, and they build a nuclear project,\u201d says energy analyst Tim Buckley. A massive solar and wind farm near Weifang, China. Credit: AP Last year China accounted for about 45 per cent of the world\u2019s solar installations, 65 per cent of the world\u2019s wind installations and 60 per cent of the world\u2019s battery energy storage systems.\n\nAs a result, it is likely that China hit peak emissions last year, or will do so this year, five years ahead of target. Even without its high-speed transformation, China is not the world\u2019s singular climate villain. It might be the biggest overall emitter, but per person China creates 8.89 tonnes of greenhouse pollution a year \u2013 much less than both Australia (15 tonnes) and the US (17.7 tonnes). In a speech last week, apparently made with an eye on the climate policies of US President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, \u201cHowever the world may change, China will not slow down its climate actions, will not reduce its support for international co-operation, and will not cease its efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.\u201d Myth: We need nuclear for baseload power\n\nWhatever the case for nuclear energy \u2013 and it is a case that is at best contested \u2013 the need for baseload power is not it. In the Ipsos survey, 50 per cent of Australians believe that \u201cbuilding more renewable energy generation will lead to more blackouts and brownouts\u201d. Advocates for nuclear power claim that it will provide necessary baseload power for \u201cwhen the sun doesn\u2019t shine and the wind doesn\u2019t blow\u201d. Protesters at Peter Dutton\u2019s cancelled announcement were wearing hazmat suits and measuring out spots for a potential nuclear reactor. Credit: James Brickwood But the very notion of \u201cbaseload power\u201d is old-fashioned, says Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University. He says the idea was born during the creation of the first huge coal-fired power plants in France and England in the 1930s.\n\nSince the machines \u2013 like Australia\u2019s ageing coal fleet \u2013 could not be turned up or down to meet demand, excess capacity had to be built into the system. Modern grid technology is built to closely meet peaks and troughs in demand with variable renewables coming from various sources, backed by batteries, pumped hydro and gas. The Australian Energy Market Operator predicts that reliability is likely to be maintained over the coming years as long as investment in renewable energy is adequate. Myth: Offshore wind farms cause harm to whales The claim that offshore wind turbines harm or even kill whales is quite simply wrong, and there is credible research that suggests it is misinformation deliberately spread by fossil fuel interests.\n\nThe claim \u2013 which half of survey respondents found believable \u2013 has been thoroughly debunked by scientists. A humpback whale breaching off K\u2019gari, formerly known as Fraser Island, in Queensland. In fact, as reported by this masthead, whales swim around obstacles such as wind turbines. What about other species? Wind turbines in general \u2013 both offshore and onshore \u2013 can kill birds, though much less than traditional energy production, high-rise buildings, or cats, and there are solutions such as painting one blade black. Offshore wind infrastructure can benefit fish by creating an artificial reef. Myth: Floating wind turbines are novel, unproven technology\n\nThe federal government has declared six offshore wind zones around Australia. In some locations \u2013 including the Illawarra and Hunter coasts in NSW \u2013 the proposal is to use floating turbines in deeper water. A common criticism is that this has never been done before and is unlikely to work. Globally, most offshore wind development to date consists of turbines fixed to the seabed floor. However, that does not mean the engineering challenges of floating turbines are new. Associate Professor Michelle Voyer from the University of Wollongong and the Australian Centre for Offshore Wind Energy, says the offshore oil and gas industry has used floating infrastructure for years.\n\nLoading Floating offshore wind farms are already being built overseas, including in Scotland and Norway, she adds. Voyer says Australia is at least seven years away from constructing floating turbines and will be able to learn from overseas experience. \u201cThe companies involved are going to be doing a lot of work around questions of feasibility,\u201d she said. Myth: Building more solar and wind farms is taking away our best agricultural land",

Yep, an unmistakable mist of incredulity had arrived.\n\nSuddenly, there was nowhere to hide. In all the years before this, the team review had one, maybe two camera angles at the coaches\u2019 disposal to go through the positives and negatives of our performance, variations on the side-on, broadcast perspective that you\u2019d all be familiar with.",

    "text": "But off-label use of melanotan comes with real risks. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nOften referred to as the \u201cBarbie drug\u201d or \u201cvacation peptide\u201d, melanotan has been growing in popularity and prevalence, largely thanks to social media, where it has been promoted.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to maintain that \u201csummer glow\u201d as we head into winter, you may have come across a slew of products on social media promising to give you a \u201cnatural\u201d tan.\n\nMelanotans \u2013 often listed as melanotan I or melanotan II \u2013 are synthetic peptides that mimic the skin\u2019s natural production of melanin when exposed to the sun.\n\nDr Katherine Armour, a dermatologist and founder of Bespoke Skin Technology in Melbourne, explains that melanotan I, or afamelanotide, \u201cis a licensed medication used to treat a rare, inherited photosensitivity disorder called erythropoietic protoporphyria. Part of the protection afforded by this drug in treated patients is via its effects in tanning the skin.\u201d\n\nMelanotan I is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia to treat this skin condition. Melanotan II, on the other hand, is what you\u2019ll find in most of these tanning products online. The ingredient can also cause prolonged erections, and so can be found in some erectile dysfunction drugs.\n\nMelanotan II is not approved by the TGA for use as a tanning agent and is illegal to sell and promote in Australia.\n\nThese tanning agents appear in various forms, including nasal sprays, tablets, injections and creams. In marketing, products containing melanotan are sometimes more obliquely referred to as \u201cpeptide tanners\u201d, \u201ctan boosters\u201d, or \u201cnatural tan accelerators\u201d.",
