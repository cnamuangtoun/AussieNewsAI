    "text": "A New Zealand government authority has issued a warning about an \"ethical\" internet scheme founded by an Australian man using a false name.\n\nIt comes after the ABC revealed that the Australian corporate regulator was making \"preliminary inquiries\" into the alternative internet project, called the Equilux Lightweb, pitched as the opposite of the dark web through its requirement that users verify their identity to stop online crime.\n\nAs many as 2,000 people from around the world, including from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the US, have poured $19 million into the Lightweb startup, according to internal company records.\n\nLightweb's founder calls himself David Stryker, but his real name is David Sevelle, a NSW man with a history of investments that failed to pay off and who has previously been sanctioned by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\n\nMr Sevelle's latest Lightweb scheme, which trades under various names including StrykerFusion, has drawn the ire of New Zealand authorities by promoting its online webinars.\n\nNew Zealand's financial watchdog, the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), said it \"recommends caution\" when dealing with the Lightweb scheme and its related entities, noting that the companies were not registered in New Zealand and were promoting \"unrealistic returns\".\n\n\"StrykerFusion and its associated entities are not registered on the Financial Service Register to provide financial services or products in New Zealand,\" the warning states. \"StrykerFusion is not a member of any approved dispute resolution scheme. If investors have complaints about StrykerFusion, they will not be able to seek a resolution through an approved dispute resolution scheme.\"\n\nDo you know more about this or have a similar story? Email turner-cohen.alex@abc.net.au\n\nA Facebook advertisement promoting Lightweb's online webinars. (Facebook)\n\nThe government agency said it was concerned about the scheme's claims, particularly that \"early investors will earn multiples of their investment back in the space of a few years\".\n\n\"The FMA believes StrykerFusion's claims about investment returns are unsubstantiated and unrealistic,\" the warning reads.\n\nThe release went on to say that Mr Sevelle, the scheme's founder, had received a lifetime ban from providing financial services in Australia, and had been going by the name David Stryker, which the ABC unearthed earlier this month.\n\nMr Sevelle was contacted for comment on the latest developments, but he did not immediately respond.\n\nHe previously declined an interview with the ABC, but stated in writing that he and the Lightweb platform had done nothing wrong.\n\nIn his previous statement to the ABC, Mr Sevelle said he had not lied about his real identity and was simply using a \"professional name\", the same way actors, writers and influencers did, comparing himself to Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne.\n\nLoading...\n\nPast scheme\n\nThe Australia financial regulator, ASIC, sued Mr Sevelle in 2006 for running an unregistered property investment scheme that left 70 \"unsophisticated\" investors out of pocket to the tune of $13 million.\n\nThe scheme, called Mega Money, operated in the Central Coast, Hunter Valley, South Coast and Canberra regions.\n\nIn a previous statement to the ABC, Mr Sevelle said \"there was no impropriety\" in the Mega Money collapse and that he was not fined or charged.\n\nMr Sevelle was banned permanently through court-ordered enforceable undertakings from providing financial advice, dealing in financial products, and carrying on a financial services business, including through the promotion and operation of any managed investment scheme.\n\nAn advertisement for the Lightweb platform, previously named the Galaxy Lightweb. (Supplied)\n\nIn the wake of the initial media reporting, Mr Sevelle held a crisis and said customers could not receive refunds anymore while he prepared for a \"class action\" against the ABC.\n\nAt one point in the meeting, Mr Sevelle asked: \"Who is going to benefit from our demise?\"\n\nHe answered his own question: \"Definitely the Australian government if they can affect it \u2026 not blaming the Australian government just yet, but they're definitely involved now through the ABC.\"\n\nDavid Sevelle has been promoting an \"ethical\" internet scheme called the Lightweb, which is yet to launch. (Facebook)\n\nSince the meeting, Mr Sevelle wrote an email to customers.\n\n\"I will not shy away from controversy, but rather I will walk towards it, as I have taught, when there is a situation where there are two distinct truths, they will be contested,\" the email read.\n\n\"There will be only 1 victor when the intellectual battle plays out.\"\n\nHe also said: \"It is said it took Noah 50 years to build the ark with 8 persons. We are building an ark to house all of humankind within.\"\n\nASIC has previously told the ABC it was making \"preliminary inquiries\" into the Lightweb scheme.",

(Getty Images: Adam Pantozzi)\n\nThere could yet be further withdrawals. The event begins on Tuesday with the first round and quarterfinals, before the semis and final are played on Wednesday.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner met in the final of the Cincinnati Open in Ohio on Monday, and Sinner quit at 0\u20135 down in the first set, apparently due to illness. The Italian is due to partner with Katerina Siniakova. The Czech women's doubles number two has replaced Emma Navarro as partner of the men's singles world number one.\n\nWhether he will be recovered enough to play remains to be seen.\n\nThat is unlikely to help de Minaur, however, as Boulter is currently playing in a tournament in Cleveland, unless she is knocked out early.\n\nSpaniard Alcaraz is scheduled to play with Emma Raducanu.\n\nFrench veteran Gael Monfils, who partnered Kyrgios in the DC Open in Washington recently, has replaced him as Osaka's partner.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

    "text": "The cotton industry in Far North Queensland may be in its infancy, but there is hope the success of this year's crop will entice more growers to trial it.\n\nCotton is grown mainly to the south and west of Cairns, but logistics and seasonal conditions have caused the size of the planting to steadily shrink.\n\nThe unirrigated dryland cotton typically yields four bales per hectare, but agronomist Maurilio Rezende said this year, the Atherton Tablelands crop was closer to seven bales per hectare.\n\n\"It's the best season I've ever seen up here, for sure,\" he said.\n\n\"We just had enough rain just to keep the season ticking along.\n\n\"Normally, on previous years, what's been happening has been getting too much rain up front.\n\n\"This is a fantastic result, really \u2026 we had a perfect finish.\"\n\nBumper cotton harvest\n\nIt was an emotional result for grower Ross Johnson, who farms at Innot Hot Springs, about 150 kilometres south-west of Cairns.\n\nHis dryland crop has yielded about eight bales per hectare.\n\nFar North Queensland growers have yielded their best crop. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nMr Johnson thought he was in for a terrible season after a particularly wet February submerged his paddocks.\n\n\"But with favourable weather, re-fertilising in some areas and good management, it bounced back \u2014 and it's bounced back to an extraordinary, unbelievable situation,\" he said.\n\n\" It's a little bit overwhelming compared to what it was, so it's gone from disaster to, yeah, it's incredible. \"\n\nFurther west at St Ronan's Station in Forty Mile, farm manager Luke Crossley has wrapped up his sixth cotton harvest.\n\nLuke Crossley has been growing cotton for about six years. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\n\"It was a pretty wet beginning of the season, but once we started going, it turned out to be an unreal season for dryland and irrigated,\" he said.\n\nMr Crossley grew 750 hectares this year and expects to plant an extra 100 hectares next season.\n\n\"We're getting better for growing cotton in the north \u2014 definitely a change from our first few years of doing it, but it all comes with trial and error,\" he said.\n\n\"Every year we keep getting better, better yields and consistency.\"\n\nBright northern future\n\nMr Rezende said there was once a time when 10,000 hectares of cotton was grown across the western Atherton Tablelands region.\n\nThis year, about 2,000 hectares will be harvested, but he expects the strong season will tempt new and former growers to try the crop.\n\nCotton is a relatively new industry in Far North Queensland. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\n\"There's a lot of opportunity to grow up here,\" Mr Rezende said.\n\n\"We certainly have the area, we certainly have enough moisture to grow the crop, we just need to get a bit more consistent yields.\n\n\"There's a fair few growers, and growers that grew in the past and they stopped growing, [that] are looking to grow cotton again.\n\n\"I reckon if we see cotton [prices] again around that $700 plus [per bale], there definitely will be a lot more growers growing again.\"\n\nCotton yields are measured in bales. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nCotton serves as a rotation crop in a broadacre system, helping to maintain soil health for other crops such as corn and sorghum.\n\nBut one of the biggest costs facing growers is transport, as the cotton needs to travel about 1,000 kilometres south to a gin in Emerald for processing.\n\nBut if the industry continued its positive trajectory, Mr Rezende saw potential for a processing facility to be established closer to home.\n\n\"The more we get consistent yields, the area is going to grow and then the gin will follow for sure,\" he said.",

Kaeo Weekes, who's pretty familiar with the spectacular himself, says Strange \"just does whatever he wants on the field\".\n\nStrange is young enough that he's never played against Penrith, who the Raiders will face in a blockbuster on Friday night, so all he knows about them is what he's seen and heard.\n\nHe's young enough to have never played in a finals game, a run that will end in just a few weeks, and young enough that when he goes back home to the Central Coast he's still just one of the fellas.\n\n\"A lot of my mates from back home don't really watch footy. Some of them won't even watch my games,\" Strange said.\n\nThe NRL's most improved for 2025 Photo shows A man runs the ball during a rugby league match When Kaeo Weekes faced his former club for the first time in 2025 he had one of the toughest nights of his career. He finished the rematch as one of Canberra and the NRL's newest and most dazzling stars.\n\n\"It's really easy to stay grounded because they're not bothered about it, I go home and I'm never talking about footy.\n\n\"I'm just the same old me cause of that, so shout out to those boys.\"\n\nIt's a good thing that Strange has those old mates to keep him humble, because on the field he is soaring.\n\nHis footwork and power make him a terror on the edge of the ruck, his toughness makes him a roughneck in the best sense of the word and, like any good Raider under Ricky Stuart, there are few problems he can't solve with a combination of focused aggression and a willingness to do whatever it takes.\n\nStrange's attacking stats in 2025 \u2014 through 21 games he has 11 tries, nine try assists, 14 line breaks, 11 line break assists and 71 tackle busts \u2014 don't just speak for themselves, they match up with some of Canberra's very best individual seasons of recent years.\n\nJack Wighton, who Strange replaced at five-eighth at the beginning of last year, played 22 games in his Dally M season in 2020 for 13 tries, eight try assists, 11 line breaks, 14 line break assists and 66 tackle busts.\n\nThere are similarities between the two \u2014 they both love the physical side of the game, an attribute Strange attributes to his father, Roosters NRLW and women's Blues coach John.\n\n\"That\u2019s something the old man put into me. He coached me growing up and he was always big on being physical no matter where you play \u2013 in the halves or fullback or whatever, you always have to be physical,\" Strange said.\n\nBoth Strange and Wighton have a left-foot step that cracks like a whip \u2014 the former's second try against Manly two weeks ago was straight out of the Wighton playbook \u2014 even though Strange is right-footed.\n\nBut Strange is his own man and his own player, and now this is his time. In a sophomore season where he's improved with each game, he's been playing hard and direct and dangerously, and he's learning how to do it all the time.\n\n\"I'm just trying to stay on the ball. Last year I could zone in and out of games, sometimes I'd be really involved and sometimes I wouldn't. This year I just try to stay consistent,\" Strange said.\n\n\"There's been a lot more clarity about how we play and our attack.\n\n\"I don't know why [I step off my left], I carry it left-handed as well but I'm right-handed and kick with my right.\n\n\"A lot of the boys I grew up watching and who played here, like Blake Austin and Jack Wighton, they did the same, so maybe it comes from them.\"\n\nIt can be easy for a Raider to fly under the radar but after the season they've had there's no escaping the limelight, especially for Strange.\n\nThe young Raider has helped his side to storm into premiership contention. (Getty Images: Mark Nolan)\n\nAfter his last game, a three-try effort against Manly, Stuart predicted he would make the Kangaroo tour and play State of Origin next year, which is saying something given how hard Stuart has worked all season to keep the Raiders young stars grounded.\n\nStrange didn't want to talk about it too much, other than affirming he would like to represent New South Wales and Australia ahead of New Zealand or England, given he's eligible for all three nations.\n\nBut he did say that such praise meant more coming from Stuart than it would from anybody else.\n\nThe two are close \u2014 Stuart wanted the Raiders to sign Strange based on just a couple of minutes of match footage and helped secure his signature by assuring Strange's parents he'd treat him like his own son.\n\nBut there's much to do before Stuart's heady predictions are put to the test, starting with the match against Penrith in Mudgee, which shapes as a finals match in all but name.\n\nIt's a big one for the young Raiders, who are 3-1 in their matches against the top four this season but have yet to play the Panthers. They're all big games from here on in as the club pushes for its first premiership in over three decades.\n\nA lack of experience in the finals has been tagged as Canberra's biggest weakness, but that freshness cuts both ways when it comes to a player like Strange.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nHe is young enough that he's never played in games like this before, but by the same token, he's young enough that he's never been scarred by defeat or learned how to be afraid \u2014 which means he's fearless.\n\nThere's an eagerness to the Raiders to lock horns with the best, the hunger of the rising contender with their eyes on the champion, and that comes through as Strange explains he doesn't find the challenges ahead intimidating, but exhilarating.\n\n\"That's what I'm looking forward to, seeing how I go in those kind of situations,\" Strange said.\n\n\"The Panthers know who they are. They're so good and thorough with their game plan and through that winning streak they've gone back to what they've been for so long.\n\n\"I try not to think too much about the proportions or what's going on outside of the field because once you get out there it's another game.\n\n\"When you're in a big game, like the ones we had against the Bulldogs or the Storm, it's still a game of footy.\"",

    "text": "Western Australia's environmental regulator has approved the construction of a $4 billion hot briquetted iron plant near the state's largest export port.\n\nThe processing plant, set to be built in Port Hedland, is backed by South Korean steel-maker POSCO and would refine raw iron ore from the Pilbara and turn it into direct reduction process hot briquetted iron (HBI), otherwise known as briquetted steel.\n\nThe state's Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has approved the Port Hedland Iron (PHI) project to produce 2 million tonnes of iron briquettes annually.\n\nThe export town is the second-largest regional centre in the Pilbara, which provides around 40 per cent of the world's iron ore.\n\nHot briquetted iron is considered a more valuable product, which could more than double Australia's iron ore export revenue, according to a report published in May by the Superpower Institute.\n\nThe PHI project would be located in the Boodarie Strategic Industrial Area, about 10km from of South and Port Hedland. (Supplied: PHI)\n\nThe project, originally called the Port Hedland Green Steel Project, plans to be powered by renewables by 2050.\n\nExperts, however, are not convinced it will reach those ambitions.\n\nHow green is it?\n\nFor the refining process to be considered green, the plant will need to be powered by renewable energy.\n\nThe EPA report outlines POSCO's plan to be 100 per cent powered by renewable energy by 2049.\n\nIn the meantime, the facility will be powered using gas.\n\nUniversity of Western Australia sustainable engineering researcher Bill Grace said it would be incorrect to call the project green.\n\n\"It's potentially a green iron project in the long term \u2026 but it's not a green project from the outset, that's for sure,\" he said.\n\nMr Grace was not convinced the project would come to fruition because it was not clear how POSCO would source the hydrogen needed to displace gas.\n\n\"POSCO aren't proposing to produce renewable energy \u2026 so they would be buying that green energy from someone, which means someone has to have a bankable green hydrogen project to make this work,\" he said.\n\nIn recent months, several high-profile hydrogen projects, including in the Pilbara, have been abandoned by investors.\n\nHundreds of millions of tonnes of iron ore is shipped out of Port Hedland every year. (ABC Pilbara: Charlie Mills)\n\nPaving the way\n\nIn its report, the EPA acknowledged the project would create \"significant\" greenhouse gas emissions while powered by gas.\n\nBut it reasoned it would provide a net benefit to global emissions by helping decarbonise the steelmaking process.\n\nIt highlighted the project's potential to pave the way for more renewable hydrogen projects.\n\n\"The EPA also notes the broader potential of the proposal to act as a commercial enabler of the renewable hydrogen industry in Western Australia,\" the report said.\n\nMoving on from port town\n\nTown of Port Hedland Mayor Peter Carter said the project would represent a major step forward for the area by diversifying its economy beyond exporting iron ore in its raw form.\n\nPeter Carter says if it goes ahead the project would inspire job creation and business investment. (ABC News: Eliza Borrello)\n\n\"We've always been an iron ore port and we'll continue to be an iron ore port,\" he said.\n\n\"But [now with] a company like POSCO coming to town and having a green [iron] mill in our town, it will attract so many other people to come and say, 'If POSCO is there, why aren't we there?' It's a big draw card for other industry to come to play.\"\n\nIn its report, the EPA noted potential risks to the town's air quality from the project's nitrous oxide emissions, especially when considering separate developments earmarked for the same area.\n\nThe project would be located within the Boondarie Strategic Industrial Area, where several major mining companies are also developing hydrogen projects.\n\nMayor Peter Carter said he was not concerned about air quality in town with the project based 15km away. (ABC News: Charlie McLean)\n\nCr Carter said local air pollution was not a concern for town residents.\n\n\"I think it will be fine. The location is about 15 kilometres out of town,\" he said.\n\nWith environmental approval secured, the next step for the project would be gaining the consent of the area's Kariyarra native title holders.\n\nThat can not happen until the Kariyarra people reach a land use agreement with the WA government, something still being negotiated.\n\nA spokesperson for Port Hedland Iron, the body set up to manage the project, said the environmental approval was an important step as it considered a final investment decision.",

It fits all the things that we love. \"\n\nHowever, their dwelling has fallen foul of local council rules and they may lose their home.\n\nWhen the couple had their tiny home on wheels built in Coolagolite in 2023, they saw it as an opportunity to secure a place during a rental crisis.\n\nThey believed their tiny home was classified as a caravan within NSW government legislation, as it was on wheels and could be towed on the road.\n\nThe couple has permission from the land owners to park their tiny home. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\n\"It was designed to fit within the size and weight specifications for caravans as per Transport for NSW,\" Mr Heins said.\n\nTiny homes on wheels are not considered permanent dwellings and are therefore dealt with under vehicle safety laws, often assessed as caravans.\n\nUnder NSW law, one caravan can be installed on a property without needing council approval if it is associated with an occupied house and used by members of the household.\n\nThe couple is not related to the owners of the property, but they say they are \"like second family\" and believe the definition of household is \"broad\" under the law.\n\nThe owners say they are happy to be able to help the couple and support them being on the property.\n\nAn eviction notice was delivered to the property. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nBega Valley Shire Council issued the owners of the property a draft eviction notice in April and followed it with a formal notice in June.\n\nThe council referred to the dwelling as an unauthorised structure that needed development approval and ordered them to stop using or to demolish the structure by the end of September.\n\n\"We were very shocked and surprised,\" Mr Bohn said.\n\n\"All of this time, money and effort put into a place to be called home, it was suddenly like it's taken without any path for us.\"\n\nThe couple had their tiny home designed by local engineers. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nCrisis units in dispute\n\nThe Social Justice Advocates of the Sapphire Coast (SJA) is facing similar challenges over the definitions of moveable dwellings.\n\nThe charity's housing and homelessness convenor, Michael Brosnan, said the organisation operated two dozen caravans and eight moveable units across the Bega Valley to house people at risk of homelessness or needing transitional accommodation.\n\n\"That area of housing is vital for our community, and it's shown to be vital because of the number of homelessness,\" Mr Brosnan said.\n\nThree crisis accommodation units are located on private church land in Bega, but the council has determined there is no pathway to approve them.\n\nMr Brosnan said the SJA had attempted to get multiple development applications through the council.\n\nThree units that can be folded up and transported by trailer are currently in dispute. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nHe said the council had taken the view that the dwellings were to be classified as \"manufactured homes\".\n\nHowever, Mr Brosnan said they were too small to fit that classification, and he could not get them registered to be towed on the road.\n\nThe SJA lodged a case in the NSW Land and Environment Court against the council over the definitions of their units, and a two-day hearing is scheduled for December.\n\n\"We've just got to work out a way forward,\" Mr Brosnan said.\n\n\"I'm certainly not going to knock on the doors and ask those people to leave.\"\n\nMick Brosnan says there is a housing crisis in the Bega Valley. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nLegislation delays\n\nThe NSW government is considering reforms to the planning legislation around moveable dwellings and caravans.\n\nThe Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure released draft reforms in late 2023, but when questioned by the ABC, it did not say when they would be finalised.\n\n\"Reforms for tiny homes and moveable dwellings are still being considered before any final policy decisions are made,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"Councils can already approve tiny homes through its relevant approval pathway.\n\n\" Separate approval pathways for tiny homes are not necessary because they are considered either buildings, manufactured homes, or caravans, which already have clear approval pathways. \"\n\nThe department put the responsibility back on local councils to interpret and apply the legislation.\n\nChallenge for councils\n\nBega Valley Shire Mayor Russell Fitzpatrick said the matter was \"not a high priority for the state government\".\n\n\"The need is to get a clear definition, otherwise council becomes the meat in the sandwich in the local arguments, as is the case here,\" he said.\n\nCr Fitzpatrick declined to comment on individual cases within the Bega Valley.\n\nRussell Fitzpatrick wants the NSW government to clarify how councils should classify tiny homes. (ABC South East NSW: Floss Adams)\n\nHowever, the council drafted a Local Approvals Policy to create an approval pathway for the SJA's crisis accommodation units this year, but said in recent council meeting papers that the Department of Planning did not support it as it used ambiguous terms and contained factual inaccuracies.\n\n\"It's all well and good to say, 'Oh, they can just implement a Local Planning Act'. Well, it's not as simple as that,\" Cr Fitzpatrick said.\n\n\"You're at the behest of the state government all the time.\"\n\nFurther north, Shellharbour City Council planned a tiny house pilot last year but told the ABC it was still working through \"the complex legislative pathway\" and had not been able to start it.\n\nHeather Shearer researches attitudes around tiny homes in Australia. (ABC News: Nicholas McElroy)\n\nHeather Shearer, a researcher with Griffith University's School of Engineering and Built Environment, said most councils were not averse to tiny homes on wheels, but did not know how to classify them.\n\n\"It's perfectly understandable that councils are reluctant because many councils in Australia have very small budgets. They don't have a huge number of planners,\" Dr Shearer said.\n\n\" The onus should be on state and federal governments rather than the councils. \"\n\nMs Shearer said tiny homes would not \"solve the housing crisis\", but clearer approval pathways were crucial to help them become a viable option in the country's housing mix.\n\nMr Heins and Mr Bohn are also appealing their matter to the Land and Environment Court.\n\n\"Everyone talks about the housing crisis. Here's people \u2026 finding small solutions,\" Mr Heins said.\n\n\"They're finding little gaps, little edges and niches where they can do something positive.\n\n\"It's time for change.\"",

He was seen with an icepack on his head during a break and retired after playing just 22 minutes.\n\nSinner, who turned 24 on Saturday, was on a 12-match winning streak and had won 26 straight matches on hard courts. He was bidding to become the first player to win back-to-back men's Cincinnati Open titles since Roger Federer in 2014 and 2015.\n\nAlcaraz, who is ranked number two, now holds a 9-5 advantage in his match-ups with the Italian.\n\nSinner won in four sets at Wimbledon, while the Spaniard won a five-set thriller at the French Open, while winning in straight sets in the Rome Masters in May.\n\nIt was only the third time the top two men's players have met in the Cincinnati Open final, the last being Novak Djokovic and Alcaraz in 2022 and Federer and Djokovic in 2012.\n\nThe Cincinnati Open is considered a tune-up for the US Open, which begins this weekend in New York.\n\nThe past two years, both the men's and women's Cincinnati Open champions went on to win the final grand slam tournament of the year.\n\nSwiatek downs Paolini to claim Cincinnati title for the first time\n\nThird-ranked Iga Swiatek captured the Cincinnati Open title by defeating number seven Jasmine Paolini 7-5, 6-4.\n\nSwiatek has won all six meetings against the Italian, dropping only one set in those matches.\n\nPaolini jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first set but Swiatek roared back to go ahead 5-3.

    "text": "Do you find the sounds of everyday technology annoying? These sounds are almost impossible to avoid or ignore.\n\nOur lives are threaded with technology from the hum of our fridges and vacuum cleaners to the rumbles of life-saving medical equipment.\n\nIn recent years, personal devices like Alexa and Siri have made digital voices a daily interaction, with the rise of AI chatbots likely to increase how often we converse with machines.\n\nA group of Melbourne-based sound artists are asking: how is technology changing the way we hear \u2014 and how should we value the sounds they make?\n\nThese artists show that beauty can still be found in our everyday lives and unexpected places, even in the toughest of circumstances such as while undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nMaking art in challenging circumstances\n\nWhen musician Biddy Connor first underwent chemotherapy in 2020, she became obsessed with the sounds of the IV machine that pumped fluids into her body.\n\n\"On my first day of chemo, as soon as the nurse walked away, I put my phone on top of the IV machine to record it,\" Connor shares.\n\n\" It was my way of coping with what was happening. \"\n\nConnor received her cancer diagnosis only a few weeks before starting treatment.\n\n\"I didn't know what to expect so I was scared,\" she says.\n\nListening to the hospital sounds around her brought Connor some comfort.\n\n\"I was in a room with six other people and they all had their sounds as well as their nurses talking to them,\" she recalls.\n\nBiddy Connor recorded IV machines from her chemotherapy sessions and turned them into songs. (Chamber Made: Sarah Walker)\n\nDuring her time in hospital, Connor kept recording the sounds of the medical equipment around her. She became fascinated by the rhythmic bangs and beeps as the machines administered medications and monitored her condition.\n\nThe intersection between listening, technology and the body is what Tamara Saulwick wants artists and audiences to experience during Listening Acts, an upcoming exhibition and live performances in the Melbourne Recital Centre.\n\nSaulwick is the artistic director of Chamber Made, a Melbourne-based group of sound artists and experimental performers.\n\n\"In some cases, these artists are revealing the poetry in every day technological sounds,\" Saulwick says. \"Others are using technology as the vehicle to deliver the sound.\"\n\nHow sound artists are using technology\n\nUnlike traditional musicians, sound artists often work with environmental sounds as well as musical elements. They also experiment with different methods of recordings.\n\nOne of the installations in the exhibition is Monica Lim's Chit + Chat: two water-cooler machines imbued with interactive chatbots.\n\nLim was inspired by the water-cooler chats which used to be the glue that bind office workers together. She asks the question: \"What happens when the workers are replaced by machines that listen?\"\n\nThe water coolers, called Chit and Chat, can respond to nearby conversations, just like a human colleague.\n\nAt a time when we're fiercely debating the role of AI in our lives, \"[Lim] is using the technology and critiquing the technology at the same time,\" Saulwick says.\n\nAnother artist in the performance, Aviva Endean, uses binaural recording methods to create intimate sounds that could only be experienced through headphones.\n\nBinaural technology tries to replicate the acoustic properties of human ears, Endean explains. \"Binaural recording uses microphones placed in the same position as our ears.\"\n\nEndean's piece goes to the edges of what we can hear, including sounds that can only be heard through bone conduction similar to how a doctor uses a stethoscope.\n\nAviva Endean's sound installation uses technology which replicates human hearing including sounds which can only be heard through headphones. (Supplied: Chamber Made)\n\n\"Without the headphones on, you wouldn't hear anything at all because it would be so quiet,\" she says. \"But with the bone conduction, the sound feels extremely present.\"\n\nBut working with binaural technology makes Endean query: do we all hear sounds in the same way? Part of the answer to Endean's question might be found in the Deaf and hard of hearing community.\n\nFinding meaning in the noise\n\nThe Deaf and hard of hearing community makes a distinction between hearing and listening.\n\nOn her website, percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie, one of the most high-profile deaf musicians, clarifies the difference between hearing and listening:\n\n\" Hearing is a medical condition, whereas listening is an act of choice. \"\n\nAlthough people's capacity to hear might be on a spectrum, everyone is capable of listening.\n\n\"It's the intentionality and the focus with which we attend to the listening act that's critical,\" Saulwick says.\n\nSaulwick's own installation is a distillation of recordings from three vocalists, dispersed through 39 tablet speakers.\n\nHard of hearing composer makes music from hearing aids Photo shows A collection of hearing aids held in composer Rebecca Bracewell's hands. Rebecca Bracewell creates music by harnessing feedback emitted by her hearing aids.\n\nEndean says it's possible to enjoy sounds without placing any judgement on its source.\n\n\"I often find something interesting from just listening to sound as material,\" she says. \"So not necessarily thinking about what is creating this sound.\"\n\nConnor has used her chemotherapy cancer journey to find meaning in the sounds others think are unpleasant, even distressing.\n\nShe has used some of her hospital recordings as part of an album.\n\nConnor's new song-cycle, Song To The Cell, features two IV machines as accompanying instruments to her singing.\n\n\"I enjoy really challenging sounds, but I also love the release from them into beauty,\" Connor admits.\n\n\" I hope it helps people to listen more to what's going on around them. \"\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

    "text": "If productivity has been the same for 10 years, does it mean everyone is actually happy about it? Or it's at a point where no one wants to take extra actions to improve it perhaps people don't believe it's worth doing it? As per previous news, many topics in the roundtable are about increasing taxes, from taxing property owners to increasing GST and taxing EV on road usage. I don't understand how increasing taxes can be linked to improving productivity. Even if we improved productivity by imposing more taxes, can our standard of living really be better? - Gan6324\n\nThanks for the question.\n\nTo your second point, the people calling for different kinds of taxes aren't necessarily calling for more taxes overall.\n\nThey're calling for our tax system to be rearranged \u2014 and that can mean having exactly the same level of taxation as exists now, but with higher taxes in some areas and lower taxes in other areas.\n\nWhat's often forgotten in discussions about the tax system is how taxes get people to behave in certain ways because people respond to the incentives and disincentives that taxes provide.\n\nSo, if we want less of something, we should tax it more. If we want more of something, we should tax it less.\n\nBut right now, the tax system is so out of whack that it's overly reliant on taxing the income of younger workers (don't we want people to work?), while encouraging people to pour their money into non-productive assets (like owner-occupied housing).\n\nEconomists like Ken Henry and Ross Garnaut, to the Productivity Commission and others, have also been sounding the alarm about the \"economic rents\" that monopolistic and oligopolistic industries are extracting from Australia's economy.\n\nThey say the optimal tax treatment of those industries is to tax them more, and that would allow us to tax smaller businesses much less. They say small businesses need help from the tax system (with less tax, and more tax incentives), to grow, to thrive, and to compete with the huge incumbents, and that could lead to greater business investment that would lead to productivity growth.\n\nSo, higher taxes (in some areas of the economy) and lower taxes (in other areas of the economy) could improve productivity in the years ahead, if they work hand-in-hand.\n\nWe have to think in holistic terms about the issue, not piecemeal.",

    "text": "The Queensland government has flagged potential changes to the state's learner licence scheme, including the requirement for 100 hours of supervised driving.\n\nThe former Labor government kicked off a review of Queensland's learner licence program in 2023, which still hasn't been completed.\n\nOne of the key requirements for learner drivers who are under the age of 25 is to undertake 100 hours of supervised driving.\n\nTransport Minister Brent Mickelberg said the current licensing scheme had some \"second order consequences\", pointing to the 100 hours rule as an example.\n\n\"Many young people are disadvantaged because they don't have access to be able to do those 100 hours. We're looking at that piece of work at the moment,\" he said.\n\nQueensland Transport Minister Brent Mickelberg says some young people don't have the ability to do 100 hours of supervised driving. (ABC News)\n\n\"I think it's fair to say it's a pretty complicated space. We want to ensure that we get the right road safety outcomes, that drivers are equipped to be able to safely use our roads.\n\n\"But we also want to ensure that young people have access to be able to get a driver's licence as well.\"\n\nMr Mickelberg indicated the government was also looking at other forms of licensing, such as those used by motorcyclists.\n\nLearners need to be 'exposed to different conditions'\n\nRACQ general manager for advocacy Joshua Cooney said having a good sample of driving as a learner before going onto a provisional licence was \"very important\".\n\n\"It's very important for learners to be exposed to different conditions, road conditions, different weather \u2014 whether it's driving during the day or driving at night,\" he said.\n\nMr Cooney acknowledged access to a car was fundamental to accumulating 100 hours of supervised driving.\n\n\"I guess there's different ways that we can help learners through their learning journey,\" he said.\n\nQueensland reviews learner licence process, including 100 hours supervised driving requirement Photo shows A learner driver symbol on the windscreen of a car The review will look at all components of the Queensland graduated licensing system, including new technology.\n\n\"But \u2026 there probably needs to be a core threshold for people to spend time as a learner driver behind the wheel learning different conditions and different circumstances.\n\n\"Mobility is critical and we appreciate the government looking at ways to help young Queenslanders with their mobility means.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Department of Transport and Main Roads said the review of the learner licence program was due to be completed by June.\n\nThe review is examining other elements of the scheme, including the practical driving test and the PrepL course.\n\nThe requirement for 100 hours of supervised driving has been in place in Queensland since 2007.\n\nLearner drivers over the age of 25 do not need to do the 100 hours before moving to their provisional licence.",

    "text": "Some interpreted Andy Farrell\u2019s praise for the Wallabies being a \u201chell of a team\u201d and a \u201cforce to be reckoned with\u201d as a cynical deflection away his team losing the third Test, and maybe some of it was. But it was also pretty spot on. Consistency is key It got a bit lost in the confusion of James O\u2019Connor\u2019s selection - and a reshuffling bench - but the value of selection consistency by Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt was clear in the Boks\u2019 upset. Schmidt named the same starting side from Sydney, bar one, and mostly the same bench, too. The last time Schmidt named just one change in the starting XV? The team that ran on against England at Twickenham last year. It can take some luck with injuries, but cohesion and consistency haven\u2019t been a strong point of the Wallabies in recent years, with lots of tinkering from lots of coaches. But when looking at World Cup-winning sides, fielding most of the same team over a number of preceding years is always a common trait.\n\nDon\u2019t rush veterans out the door Nic White of the Wallabies applauds the fans after being substituted off. Credit: Getty Images The contributions of Nic White recently, with gritty defence and pressure kicking, show the value of time in the Test saddle. It simply can\u2019t be faked. And even after several years in the wilderness, and after a patchy start, James O\u2019Connor\u2019s muscle memory had him pulling all the right levers in the second half, when every bad decision can concede territory and points. Longer-term No.23 anyone? We can be quick in rugby to search for the next young thing, rising up the ladder. But mostly, when it comes to Test rugby, the proven old thing is way more valuable.\n\nLeadership is about action Harry Wilson is not the most naturally athletic footballer, and that was his downfall in the eyes of Wallabies coaches before Joe Schmidt. Dave Rennie had him in and out of the Wallabies, and Eddie Jones just had him out. But Schmidt has figured out that there have not been many more passionate Wallabies ever, than Wilson, and his choice as captain has materially improved the side. He lifts as a leader, and the Wallabies take their emotional cues from the skipper. If you are looking for answers about why the Wallabies \u201chave no quit in them\u201d, as Michael Hooper said, look no further than the example set by the captain. Jorgensen is a freak\n\nAt what point do we stop being surprised by the stuff \u2018Mild Max\u2019 can do on a rugby field? In yet another superb Test performance \u2013 coming after a superb spring tour and a super Lions series \u2013 Jorgensen scored a crucial try with his trademark side-swerve that regularly embarrasses teammates at training. But it was his gritty defence that shone just as much at Ellis Park. Even with forwards down his channel, Jorgensen stood his ground all night. Rank improvement The win over the Springboks may help the Wallabies go deep at the 2027 World Cup, and not just boost belief. It also boosted the Wallabies\u2019 world ranking in a major way, with the 16-point win harvesting three valuable ranking points.\n\nLoading The Wallabies need to finish the year in the top six to get a top seeding for their home World Cup. That way, you avoid having one of the very big boys in your pool, and likely avoid major teams in the early finals, too. The Wallabies are still ranked sixth, but the win over the Boks turned a narrow margin ahead of Argentina into a big buffer. And get this - if the Wallabies beat SA again with the same margin, they can even leapfrog the Boks into third this weekend Nick Frost is world-class\n\nThe giant Brumby was demoted on the spring tour last year because the Wallabies coaches wanted more edge and physicality from him. Frost has vastly improved his contact strength and a thumping one-on-one shot on Eben Etzebeth in the second half spoke volumes. Throw in the fact Frost is arguably the best lineout forward in the game, and the 206cm giant is shaping as a vital World Cup weapon. Schmidt is a mind-gamer It was an historic win, but it didn\u2019t stop Joe Schmidt going hard on the mind games straight after the Wallabies win, saying he felt the team had been lucky and the scoreboard didn\u2019t reflect the contest against a Boks side who\u2019ll be fired up next week in Cape Town.\n\nIt would be interesting to hear if the language used in the dressing rooms was the same. You\u2019d doubt it. Hot takes may burn There was no shortage of pundits and columnists keeping a low profile on Sunday, or audibly beeping as they swiftly reversed their views. Scepticism about a Wallabies win was understandable, but the scalding hot take of one RugbyPass columnist \u2013 titled The Wallabies have no chance against the Springboks \u2013 ended up particularly egg-on-facey. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest: if the Springboks don\u2019t pulverise the Wallabies at Ellis Park, it\u2019s a major upset. Ellis Park doesn\u2019t deal in fairy tales. The altitude is unforgiving, the Boks are unrelenting, and history is unyielding. This is the double world champions against the sixth-best team in the world. How good are the Wallabies? We\u2019re about to find out. Keep an ear out for the audible thunk as they come back down to earth.\u201d We heard a thunk, alright.\n\nAre the Wallabies hoodoo gurus? This Wallabies side is quietly ticking off some hoodoos and records. The win at Twickenham was the first against England there since 2016, the Wales\u2019 win was a record, and victory over the Lions at Accor was the first win at Sydney Olympic Park in a decade. The win in Newcastle was a first, too. The Wallabies celebrate with the Ella Mobbs Cup after their victory. Credit: Getty Images The breakthrough win at Ellis Park now means the longest drought at a regular venue is Eden Park, at 39 years. The Wallabies play the All Blacks at Eden Park next month. That is all. Just leaving it there.\n\nFraser McReight is the world\u2019s best no.7 As far as a pure openside fetcher goes, it\u2019s hard to find anyone as good in the world game as Fraser McReight. His performance against the Boks continued a remarkable tradition of No.7s in gold, and his and names sits comfortably with Poidevin, Wilson, Waugh, Smith, Pocock and Hooper. Fraser McReight is world class. Credit: Getty Images Discipline is key As recently as three years ago, the Wallabies\u2019 discipline was the worst of any tier-one nation. They routinely conceded 12-13 penalties a game and lost at least one man to the sin-bin each game.\n\nLoading It pointed to a team that struggled for belief and was more often on the back foot than the front. That has changed dramatically under Schmidt and his obsession with strong fundamentals, particularly in the carry-clean. The Wallabies conceded just four penalties at Ellis Park, and have now gone seven straight Tests without a card; the longest since 2017. Depth is developing The Wallabies\u2019 depth has been a problem in recent years, but it is worth noting Schmidt\u2019s side claimed back-to-back wins against the British and Irish Lions and the Springboks without star forwards Rob Valetini and Allan Alaalatoa, their first two choices for the No.10 jersey and the first-choice No.9. And with a couple of hookers missing as well. Giteau law demise timely",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size When people first encounter the art of Charles Brooks, they\u2019re invariably impressed \u2013 if a little perplexed. Some of his works recall the grand pillars of ancient Roman architecture, or volcanic caves forged by fiery explosions. Others resemble the types of precious metals one expects to find inside a pirate\u2019s treasure chest, or old-fashioned rooms with peculiar Alice in Wonderland-style dimensions. Many admirers assume these images were created on a computer, perhaps with the aid of artificial intelligence. Some might mistake them for photorealist illustrations. Few realise they are actually photographs \u2013 and they all have one thing in common. Brooks, 47, is a Melbourne-based photographer who specialises in capturing the interiors of musical instruments. It\u2019s a highly technical endeavour that involves a laparoscope \u2013 a thin, tube-like camera used in keyhole surgery \u2013 in addition to multiple light sources, sophisticated editing software, infrared thermometers and sacks of rice. Brooks is the only person in this world who uses this technique, which he developed himself. Self-portrait by Charles Brooks, a former professional cellist who now specialises in photographing the interiors of musical instruments. Credit: Charles Brooks \u201cIt started during the COVID lockdowns,\u201d he explains when I visit him at his Hawthorn apartment to observe him at work. \u201cAll these musicians started losing jobs, so they decided to put their instruments into the repair shop. I took the opportunity to go in with my probe lenses and play around, but I never thought it would become a whole thing.\u201d When Brooks posted an early photo on Reddit, revealing the interior of a friend\u2019s 245-year-old cello, he expected to sell a handful of prints. But over the past few years, his extraordinary images have been reproduced an estimated 20 million times in newspapers and magazines across the world. What began as a niche pursuit is now his full-time occupation. In partnership with the Australian World Orchestra, which will perform Mahler\u2019s 4th and 5th symphonies in Melbourne and Sydney in September, Brooks is photographing two instruments on this crisp winter\u2019s morning: a cello, circa mid-1700s, and a viola made in the 1910s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAWO cellist Molly Kadarauch looks suitably nervous as she hands over her instrument, which was crafted by Pietro Antonio Testore, a member of Milan\u2019s highly regarded Testore family. \u201cI\u2019ve had it since 1989,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a couple of cracks, which devalued it, so it\u2019s been under extensive repair.\u201d Kadarauch breathes a sigh of relief when she learns that Brooks is a former professional musician himself, having held principal cello positions in China, Chile and Brazil. \u201cA didgeridoo is deliberately hollowed out by termites, which is why it looks like a cave,\u201d Brooks says. Credit: Charles Brooks He passes her cello to Bendigo-born violin maker Rainer Beilharz, who sets about cleaning its interior by pouring dry rice through the F-holes on either side of its bridge \u2013 so named because they resemble a cursive F \u2013 before gently shaking it and tipping the grains back out. \u201cStradivarius himself would have done this,\u201d Beilharz explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a time-honoured technique, which is why no one messes with it.\u201d Brooks places the cello on a felt-covered table, which is surrounded by three flash bulbs. He hands Kadarauch the thermometer gun, inserts his laparoscope \u2013 which he has modified to capture high-resolution images \u2013 and begins shooting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are intensely powerful lights, so they put out a lot of heat,\u201d he says as he instructs Kadarauch to alert him if the temperature nears 30 degrees. \u201cI have to wait eight to 10 seconds between each photograph so I don\u2019t boil the varnish.\u201d It\u2019s a painstaking process, requiring up to 300 individual photographs. Afterwards, he will stitch them together on his computer, allowing every detail to remain in sharp focus. \u201cI use all kinds of software to blend together the bits that are in focus, which is why parts of the image are angled,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably take me three hours just to do the photos, then another week to put them together.\u201d The interior of a 1717 Stradivarius violin, with an estimated value of $20 million. In reality, it\u2019s priceless. Credit: Charles Brooks As Australian World Orchestra violist Lisa Grosman awaits her turn, Brooks mentions that he recently photographed a 1717 Stradivarius, which is on loan to her AWO colleague, Daniel Dodds. \u201cIt\u2019s a $20 million violin, so you have to take every possible precaution,\u201d he says, explaining how Beilharz carefully dismantled the end pin, bridge, strings and tailpiece in preparation for the shoot. \u201cThese instruments are held together by tension instead of glue, because glue would dampen the vibrations. When I remove that tension, there\u2019s a chance the sound post \u2013 the dowel in the centre that transfers vibrations, which is often called the \u2018soul\u2019 of a violin \u2013 could just tip over. That\u2019s why I need a luthier [a maker of string instruments] to get everything precisely back in place, because even if you move something by a millimetre, it really changes the sound. \u201cThankfully, I\u2019ve never actually had one fall over.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrooks, who hails from New Zealand, began photographing the night sky about 10 years ago. \u201cAstrophotographers often want to capture the whole Milky Way, but it\u2019s hard to get in a single shot because it arches from one horizon to the other,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to move the lens this way and that, over and over. Now, I use those techniques when I\u2019m photographing instruments. In both cases, you\u2019re trying to uncover hidden spaces and show details that you wouldn\u2019t normally see.\u201d Over the years, Brooks has documented the interiors of grand pianos, flutes, guitars, pipe organs, saxophones, clarinets, French horns and even a didgeridoo. The interior of a Fazioli grand piano. Credit: Charles Brooks \u201cI was expecting to see a wooden instrument that had been chiselled out by hand,\u201d he says. \u201cBut of course, it\u2019s an incredible organic structure because it\u2019s deliberately hollowed out by termites, which is why it looks like a cave.\u201d Each time he peers inside an instrument, he unlocks its secrets. \u201cYou\u2019ll find repairs and tool marks and even the writing of Stradivarius himself,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might discover thin wooden veneers that are a preventative measure against cracking, or you\u2019ll see scratches from cleaning or the signatures of people who\u2019ve repaired a cello or a viola.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Marlon Williams is torn between two worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\nE mawehe ana au ki nga ao e rua ( I am split between two worlds ) are the first words sung in the new documentary that follows one of Aotearoa's (the M\u0101ori name for New Zealand) greatest musical exports, Marlon Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Worlds \u2014 Ng\u0101 Ao E Rua, follows the 34-year-old musician as he records his first album sung entirely in te reo M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori language) \u2014 Te Whare T\u012bwekaweka \u2014 and documents the challenges of reconnecting with culture, deepening ties with community, and reclaiming his reo (language).\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams identifies as part M\u0101ori, part P\u0101keh\u0101 (M\u0101ori for a white New Zealander) \u2014 from both Ng\u0101i Tahu and Ng\u0101i Tai iwi (tribes). He has always sung in te reo M\u0101ori, but is still not fluent in it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a challenge many M\u0101ori share today. While language revitalisation efforts have ramped up in recent decades, reclaiming Indigenous languages is still an uphill journey. And for Williams, music is the strongest way back.\n\n\n\nAotearoa musician Marlon Williams is not fluent in M\u0101ori. But he still recorded an album entirely in te reo in the hope to reconnect with culture. Source: Supplied \"This documentary is about my process in making an album fully in te reo M\u0101ori and the M\u0101ori language and all the bumps and slides along the way,\" Williams told SBS News after its Melbourne International Film Festival premiere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maori is always a beautiful thing to sing in. Like a lot of things in my life, music was the way to find a new way of thinking. But it was very patchy and certainly wasn't fluent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm still not fluent, but music's helped me find a sense of entitlement to the language.\"\n\n\n\nLost languages\n\nTe reo M\u0101ori was once the language of daily life in Aotearoa. But British colonisation and assimilation policies sought to erase it \u2014 and almost succeeded.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren were told M\u0101ori \"had to be left at the school gates\" and that English was \"the bread-and-butter language\". Those who spoke it risked corporal punishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result was stark: In 1913, around 90 per cent of M\u0101ori schoolchildren spoke te reo (the language). But by 1975, that number had plummeted to just 5 per cent.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meet New Zealand's youngest MP whose parliamentary war cry went viral\n\nFor director Ursula Grace Williams, the Samoan filmmaker behind the documentary, that kind of loss is deeply personal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My mama is from Apia \u2014 she was born in Samoa and came over to New Zealand in the 1960s,\" Ursula told SBS News. \"At that time, it was assumed that you needed to assimilate into colonial culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer Nana, who was born in Vaimoso, a village on the island of Upolu in Samoa, prohibited her mother from speaking Samoan at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My grandmother \u2014 without any shame or disrespect at all to her \u2014 but my mum wasn't allowed to speak Samoan in the house at all.\"\n\n\n\nWe lost our connection to our own mother's tongue. Ursula Grace Williams, director of 'Marlon Williams: Two Worlds \u2013 Ng\u0101 Ao E Rua'.\n\n\"My mum was not allowed to speak, so we weren't allowed to speak. I know small greetings \u2026 but it's a shame I don't speak the language.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says her experience made her understand what it was like to \"lose something beyond your control that should belong to you forever\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You hold it in your bones.\"\n\n\n\nMusician Marlon Williams and filmmaker Ursula Grace Williams both know what it's like to lose their own language. Source: Supplied\n\nFrom loss to revival\n\nBy the mid-1970s, M\u0101ori activism was pushing back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1975, a petition with 30,000 signatures called for te reo to be taught in schools. It became a turning point, sparking the creation of k\u014dhanga reo (M\u0101ori-language preschools), bilingual and immersion schools, adult learning initiatives such as Te \u0100taarangi, and M\u0101ori broadcasting.\n\n\n\n\n\nTe reo M\u0101ori became an official language in 1987, the direct result of the WAI11 Waitangi Tribunal claim . This M\u0101ori Language Act 2016 reaffirmed that status, acknowledged the harm caused by past language suppression, and committed the Crown to revitalisation.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Pioneering Australian school aims to prove there's more to education than NAPLAN\n\nThe current strategy sets ambitious goals for 2040: over 85 per cent of New Zealanders will value te reo M\u0101ori as central to national identity; one million people will hold a basic conversation in it; and 150,000 M\u0101ori over 15 will use it as often as English.\n\n\n\n\n\nUrsula saw the benefits firsthand. \"I was lucky enough that my mum had the foresight when there was a resurgence of M\u0101ori in New Zealand in the 90s that she enrolled me into a bilingual unit,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My first learned language was actually te reo M\u0101ori. There are a lot of similarities [with Samoan].\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's Te Moana Nui a Kiwa \u2014 it's a broader region of the Pacific.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTe Moana Nui a Kiwa is a name used in both Samoan and M\u0101ori cultures to represent the Pacific Ocean \u2014 the significance of it as a source of life, a pathway for exploration, and a connector of people and culture. It is 'The Great Connector' of all Polynesia.\n\n\n\nMusic as a gateway to 'preserve difference'\n\nFor Marlon Williams, preserving M\u0101ori culture through music is part of that continuum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a very basic human thing to preserve difference,\" he said. \"In an increasingly globalised world \u2026 it's important to be able to understand different pedagogies and methodologies of understanding of life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWaitata \u2014 or Maori songs \u2014 have always carried whakapapa (genealogy), identity and history. Williams joins a long legacy of artists recording in te reo, but, as Dr Julian Rawiri Kusabs notes, that wasn\u2019t always possible.\n\n\n\nMarlon Williams joins a growing cohort of artists who have recorded songs in M\u0101ori in the last few decades, but before that, it typically wasn't viewed as being \"commercially viable\". Source: Supplied \"It hasn't always been viewed as commercially viable,\" Kusabs, a Maori educator at the University of Melbourne with Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa, Te Arawa, Ng\u0101ti Awa, Ng\u0101ti Maru (Hauraki), and Tainui iwi affiliations, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have had to fight to get that. But in the last few decades, you've had a lot of artists \u2014 both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori \u2014 recording and re-recording songs in the language.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKusabs says Marlon's album shows that fluency isn't the only measure of authenticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that there are opportunities for someone like Marlon to go back to the language and have the opportunity to record and engage in it, even despite the fact that there aren't resources that make fluency available, that's a really positive step,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThere's a range of ways that Maori people can still gain meaning even if they're not necessarily fluent. Dr Julian Rawiri Kusabs, M\u0101ori Educator at the University of Melbourne\n\n\"There's still a lot of meaning and value that can be gained from having the language more available and having more culture available.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even if they can't understand every word, just being able to hear the sounds, hear the intonations, hear the styles and connect with a long tradition that way.\"\n\n\n\nThe protest of the everyday\n\nRevival efforts have shown some signs of success.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment data shows the proportion of New Zealanders able to speak te reo in daily life rose from 24 per cent in 2018 to 30 per cent in 2021. Almost a quarter of M\u0101ori said they spoke te reo as one of their first languages, up 17 per cent in 2018, with younger people most likely to speak more than a few words or phrases.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut tensions remain.\n\n\n\n\n\nKusabs warns of recent hurdles: attempts to roll back te reo in official settings, cuts to M\u0101ori language teacher training, and a growing backlash to bilingual efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After all these fights for revitalisation, you're seeing a bit of pushback recently against having it be given equal prominence and equal opportunity and equal standing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"I think that's part of fighting for a language and also fighting for an Indigenous culture \u2014 it's filled with those difficulties, setbacks, and struggles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Ursula, the most powerful response to the film is one of persistence and the \"protest of the everyday\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's those stories of the everyday \u2014 in terms of where we choose to place our time and who we choose to connect with and how we choose to position ourselves within society \u2014 those are the things that chip away at discussions and narratives and the context of where we are,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the protest of the everyday \u2026 standing in yourself and speaking your language and reconnecting with fragments of who you are.\"\n\n\n\nMarlon Williams hopes that his story can inspire others to find their way back to te reo M\u0101ori and help them any shame around losing the language. Source: Supplied / Ian Laidlaw\n\n'It's yours by birthright'\n\nFor Marlon Williams, that persistence has already had an effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There have been people reaching out,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because I'm not fluent and because on one level, I'm not classically M\u0101ori in appearance, it feels like people have been afforded a little bit more room to find their own way back to [learning M\u0101ori] without the sense of shame or embarrassment that comes with that.\"\n\n\n\nShame is always there when trying to reclaim a language that has been lost over generations. Marlon Williams\n\nHe hopes that his album and documentary will help others shed the shame, even a little bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's there and it's yours by birthright to go into that world,\" he said. \"That sense of shame at having lost it [the language] \u2014 it's not a reason not to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the reason to get into it because that shame is something that's been overlaid into you and the estrangement is built on the system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's all the more reason to feel like you've got the right to be able to do that and go into that world.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAs government officials, business leaders and economists attend a national economic round table in Canberra this week, you will keep hearing them mention a buzzword: productivity growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank, productivity refers to how much output can be made within a given set of inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt includes two aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne is labour productivity, which focuses on workers themselves, such as their skillsets, the technology they use, and how they are managed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other one is multifactor productivity, which looks at factors beyond the workers, such as capital, land, energy and materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy will it be the focus of the national economic round table this week?\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Treasurer Jim Chalmers says that's because there's no better time than now to talk about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our economy is finally balanced, between the progress we've made on wages and inflation and living standards and the productivity that we desperately need to sustain that progress in the years and decades ahead. Living standards, higher living standards, are the holy grail, and that makes productivity the primary focus.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent decades, Australia's productivity growth has slowed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Financial Year of 2022/2023, it was only 0.9 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt mirrors the general experience of many advanced economies, but the Reserve Bank says the slowdown also reflect persistent flaws of Australia's economy, such as declining business competition, slower upgrades in technology, and low wage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrent Wiltshire, Deputy Director of Grattan Institute's Economic Prosperity program, says in the past decade, there have been attempts and measures by both federal and state governments to increase talent pools and business investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There have been reforms to skilled migration in the past few years, (such as) streamlining employer sponsorship (which has been) good, the reform of point tests (which) is underway - that's a big layer for the input - but it hasn't been implemented. There's been some attempts on tax reform, although not particularly big. We have seen some changes in higher education. State governments also play a role too, so we've seen Victorian and New South Wales (government) are reforming their planning system on more houses can be build at where people live.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr Wiltshire says these policies haven't been able to offset some persistent barriers for Australia's productivity, including its ageing population. He says Australia's growth of service sector also slows down productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of the round table, various stakeholders already signal their pitches to boost Australia's productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness representatives call for cutting the levels of red tapes and the uptake of emerging technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnions want to see four-day working weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelfare advocates urge the Government to fix what they call the broken employment services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the calls, one of the most controversial topics is artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt follows the Treasurer's comment that A-I is what he calls a game changer for Australia's economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut questions have been looming regarding A-I's tolls on human jobs, regulations on copyrights, and the capacity of businesses to roll out the technology. Even Mr Chalmers has also admitted that Australia needs to find a middle path for A-I.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jake Goldenfein is a law and technology scholar at Melbourne Law School. His research has found while A-I may help boost productivity at work, the roll out of A-I can be pricey and slow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we as a nation are interested in increasing sovereign capability around A-I and getting benefits from A-I, we need to think about ways in which we can do that but don't rely so heavily on international software companies, because we are sending a lot of cash overseas in order to procure these technology products that aren't necessarily what our organisations need, and require a lot of work to operate safely.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three-day national summit only serves as a brainstorming platform for the Albanese government.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Danielle Wood, the chair of the Productivity Commission, says the government needs to re-adopt what she calls the growth mindset to its policy making, as young Australians are already paying price for the low productivity growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians born in the 1990s \u2013 who hit the job market in the 2010s when economic growth was slow \u2013 were the first generation not to earn more than people born a decade before. \"This generation will bear more of the cost of addressing climate change \u2013 both the impacts of wilder weather, and the policy response \u2013 because Australian policy makers have for so long avoided the lowest cost policy choices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Chalmers says he has realistic but also optimistic expectations on the outcome of the summit.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says while the round table won't solve all economic problems in three days, it will set light on the government's budgets in the next three years.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Around 30 leaders from business, unions and civil society will convene in Canberra on Tuesday for three days of discussion and debate about the country's economic future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summit, first announced in June, is a key part of the government's strategy to build national consensus around economic reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers has said that the ideas discussed at the roundtable will inform \"the next three budgets and beyond\". A number of topical and controversial ideas for reform are on the table, including major tax reform, deregulating artificial intelligence and a four-day work week.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what can we expect from the roundtable, and what might it achieve?\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers speaks to the media ahead of his three-day economic reform roundtable. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\nWhat is the point of the roundtable?\n\nWhen Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the summit in June, he said the aim was to \"build the broadest possible base of support for further economic reform\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt addresses a need for long-term economic reform, in particular to improve Australia's sluggish productivity \u2014 a key determinant of our standard of living.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe roundtable follows news last week that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had downgraded productivity growth from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent . In its economic outlook, the RBA said that slow productivity will take a toll on business revenues, household incomes and demand. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that productivity has been in decline since 2016.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Anthony Albanese announces new move to tackle Australia's productivity problem\n\nAfter the RBA's announcement, Chalmers told reporters that \"productivity is the most serious economic challenge that we have in our economy\".\n\n\n\nWho will be there?\n\nThe roundtable is organised around three main themes:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Resilience (Tuesday)\n\n\n\n\n\n- Productivity (Wednesday)\n\n\n\n\n\n- Budget sustainability and tax reform (Thursday)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the invitation list is a diverse assembly of around 30 leaders from the business community, the union movement and civil society who will attend alongside economists, policy experts and heads of key government agencies. Some of the sectors represented at the roundtable include banking, universities, mining and superannuation.\n\n\n\nRBA governor Michele Bullock will deliver a presentation at the three-day economic roundtable. Source: AAP / Dan Himbrechts Presentations will be delivered by RBA governor Michele Bullock, Productivity Commission chair Danielle Wood and Grattan Institute CEO Dr Aruna Sathanapally among others. The government says a further 900 submissions from experts, industry leaders and individuals will also inform the outcome of the roundtable.\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the big ideas up for discussion?\n\nHousing is a high priority on the government's agenda, with leaked documents seen by the ABC suggesting the government may be considering deregulation to boost housing supply. These changes could include pausing the National Construction Code and reforming the Environment Protection and Biodiversity (EPBC) Act in order to speed up development approvals.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence is also proving to be a hot topic, with the Productivity Commission leading calls to reduce regulation of AI to boost productivity. This has been met with resistance from unions and creative bodies who are calling for greater protection of workers and intellectual property against the risks of AI.\n\n\n\nMultiple proposals for tax reform can be expected . Independent MP Kate Chaney is calling for an increase to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to 15 per cent, combined with an annual offset payment of $3,300 to individuals. Meanwhile, the Productivity Commission is arguing for a lowered corporate income tax rate for small and medium-sized businesses, which it says will boost investment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther topics that have been discussed in the lead-up to the roundtable include negative gearing reforms, a union-led push for a four-day work week , and reintroducing a carbon price .\n\n\n\nWhat are the concerns with it?\n\nThe leaked Treasury advice published by the ABC last week raised concerns that the outcomes of the economic roundtable may have been determined before the roundtable began. This led Opposition treasury spokesperson Ted O'Brien, who is attending the roundtable, to warn the summit had been \"engineered to rubberstamp\" Labor policy and could become a \"privileged talkfest\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Albanese told reporters that they were \"awaiting the forum, and ideas will then come through normal government processes. That's how good policy happens\".\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has defended the purpose of the economic roundtable, arguing that its role is to generate ideas that will inform economic policy. Source: AAP / Dean Lewins A spokesperson for Chalmers said the government is not \"pre-empting ideas\" but \"preparing for them as you would expect\".\n\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the government has already confirmed it won't be implementing all the ideas brought forward to the roundtable.\n\n\n\nWhat we won't see\n\nChalmers has already poured cold water on the ACTU's bid for a four-day work week. Last week, he told The Conversation \"it's not something we've been kind of working up or considering\".\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, Finance Minister Katy Gallagher has signalled a focus on working from home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Certainly we support working with unions and others about how to make sure workers have the right flexibility to juggle all the different and competing priorities in their lives and work from home is part of that ,\" she told Channel 7's Sunrise on Monday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese also downplayed the prospect of major tax reform when speaking to reporters last Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only tax policy we're implementing is the one we took to the election.\"\n\n\n\nOutside Parliament House on Monday morning, Chalmers said that while the roundtable presents a number of challenges, he is optimistic about Australia's appetite for economic reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am realistic but optimistic that we can make progress together. I don't believe we will solve every challenge in our economy in three days. This is about three days to inform the next three budgets and beyond and I am really looking forward to that.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australia's largest airline has been ordered to pay a landmark penalty of $90 million for what has been dubbed the largest case of illegal sackings in the country's history.\n\n\n\n\n\nQantas outsourced more than 1,800 baggage handlers, cleaners and ground staff in 2020, in a move the Federal Court ruled was designed to curb union bargaining power in wage negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe embattled airline's appeal to the High Court was unsuccessful, paving the way for the penalty to be awarded on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Transport Workers Union (TWU) sought the maximum penalty of $121 million , while Qantas urged Justice Michael Lee to impose a \"mid-range\" penalty between $40 million and $80 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Court judge cited the \"sheer scale of the contraventions, being the largest of their type\" as a reason to impose a penalty that would deter other businesses from similar conduct.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Nearly six million Qantas records held in hacked system, airline says\n\nHe ordered Qantas to pay $90 million in penalties, $50 million of which is to be paid directly to the union that brought the proceedings and highlighted the illegal conduct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To deprive someone of work illegally is to deprive someone of an aspect of their human dignity, and this is not assuaged simply by expressions of regret,\" Lee said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was scathing about the embattled airline's conduct after the outsourcing, pointing to efforts to place a \"less than candid\" picture of the outsourcing decision before the court .\n\n\n\n\n\nHe noted Qantas had apologised publicly but then had attempted to deny any compensation payments to the affected workers.\n\n\n\nLawyer Josh Bornstein, representing the TWU, said the penalty made industrial relations history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the largest penalty handed down for a breach of industrial relations laws in 120 years. It is also perhaps the darkest day in Qantas' 105-year history,\" he told reporters outside court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It has been five long years. Today is a victory, not just for our colleagues but for all Australian workers,\" said Anne Guirguis, who worked at Qantas for 27 years cleaning aircraft before being laid off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can close this chapter and move on now,\" Guirguis told reporters outside court.\n\n\n\n\n\nTWU national secretary Michael Kaine described the decision as a \"final win\" for the Qantas workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Qantas was not sorry to workers when it illegally outsourced these workers, many finding out they'd lost their jobs over a loudspeaker in the lunch room,\" Kaine said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Qantas is only sorry now that it has to pay the largest penalty fine of any employer in Australian corporate history.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson apologises to customers, says airline will work to rebuild trust\n\nQantas will have to pay the hefty bill on top of a $120 million compensation payment it has made to the affected ground staff for their economic loss, pain and suffering following the outsourcing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Lee said he didn't have enough evidence to be convinced those payments would be made.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court was told the scandal-plagued airline began to finally accept responsibility for its actions in 2023, Lee noted, which coincided with the departure of former CEO Alan Joyce.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe courtroom was packed with union members and representatives, who hugged and exchanged smiles after Justice Lee handed down his decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after Qantas also sold tickets to cancelled flights for several years, triggering more legal turmoil and a $100 million fine after it was sued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Some interpreted Andy Farrell\u2019s praise for the Wallabies being a \u201chell of a team\u201d and a \u201cforce to be reckoned with\u201d as a cynical deflection away his team losing the third Test, and maybe some of it was. But it was also pretty spot on. Consistency is key It got a bit lost in the confusion of James O\u2019Connor\u2019s selection - and a reshuffling bench - but the value of selection consistency by Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt was clear in the Boks\u2019 upset. Schmidt named the same starting side from Sydney, bar one, and mostly the same bench, too. The last time Schmidt named just one change in the starting XV? The team that ran on against England at Twickenham last year. It can take some luck with injuries, but cohesion and consistency haven\u2019t been a strong point of the Wallabies in recent years, with lots of tinkering from lots of coaches. But when looking at World Cup-winning sides, fielding most of the same team over a number of preceding years is always a common trait.\n\nDon\u2019t rush veterans out the door Nic White of the Wallabies applauds the fans after being substituted off. Credit: Getty Images The contributions of Nic White recently, with gritty defence and pressure kicking, show the value of time in the Test saddle. It simply can\u2019t be faked. And even after several years in the wilderness, and after a patchy start, James O\u2019Connor\u2019s muscle memory had him pulling all the right levers in the second half, when every bad decision can concede territory and points. Longer-term No.23 anyone? We can be quick in rugby to search for the next young thing, rising up the ladder. But mostly, when it comes to Test rugby, the proven old thing is way more valuable.\n\nLeadership is about action Harry Wilson is not the most naturally athletic footballer, and that was his downfall in the eyes of Wallabies coaches before Joe Schmidt. Dave Rennie had him in and out of the Wallabies, and Eddie Jones just had him out. But Schmidt has figured out that there have not been many more passionate Wallabies ever, than Wilson, and his choice as captain has materially improved the side. He lifts as a leader, and the Wallabies take their emotional cues from the skipper. If you are looking for answers about why the Wallabies \u201chave no quit in them\u201d, as Michael Hooper said, look no further than the example set by the captain. Jorgensen is a freak\n\nAt what point do we stop being surprised by the stuff \u2018Mild Max\u2019 can do on a rugby field? In yet another superb Test performance \u2013 coming after a superb spring tour and a super Lions series \u2013 Jorgensen scored a crucial try with his trademark side-swerve that regularly embarrasses teammates at training. But it was his gritty defence that shone just as much at Ellis Park. Even with forwards down his channel, Jorgensen stood his ground all night. Rank improvement The win over the Springboks may help the Wallabies go deep at the 2027 World Cup, and not just boost belief. It also boosted the Wallabies\u2019 world ranking in a major way, with the 16-point win harvesting three valuable ranking points.\n\nLoading The Wallabies need to finish the year in the top six to get a top seeding for their home World Cup. That way, you avoid having one of the very big boys in your pool, and likely avoid major teams in the early finals, too. The Wallabies are still ranked sixth, but the win over the Boks turned a narrow margin ahead of Argentina into a big buffer. And get this - if the Wallabies beat SA again with the same margin, they can even leapfrog the Boks into third this weekend Nick Frost is world-class\n\nThe giant Brumby was demoted on the spring tour last year because the Wallabies coaches wanted more edge and physicality from him. Frost has vastly improved his contact strength and a thumping one-on-one shot on Eben Etzebeth in the second half spoke volumes. Throw in the fact Frost is arguably the best lineout forward in the game, and the 206cm giant is shaping as a vital World Cup weapon. Schmidt is a mind-gamer It was an historic win, but it didn\u2019t stop Joe Schmidt going hard on the mind games straight after the Wallabies win, saying he felt the team had been lucky and the scoreboard didn\u2019t reflect the contest against a Boks side who\u2019ll be fired up next week in Cape Town.\n\nIt would be interesting to hear if the language used in the dressing rooms was the same. You\u2019d doubt it. Hot takes may burn There was no shortage of pundits and columnists keeping a low profile on Sunday, or audibly beeping as they swiftly reversed their views. Scepticism about a Wallabies win was understandable, but the scalding hot take of one RugbyPass columnist \u2013 titled The Wallabies have no chance against the Springboks \u2013 ended up particularly egg-on-facey. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest: if the Springboks don\u2019t pulverise the Wallabies at Ellis Park, it\u2019s a major upset. Ellis Park doesn\u2019t deal in fairy tales. The altitude is unforgiving, the Boks are unrelenting, and history is unyielding. This is the double world champions against the sixth-best team in the world. How good are the Wallabies? We\u2019re about to find out. Keep an ear out for the audible thunk as they come back down to earth.\u201d We heard a thunk, alright.\n\nAre the Wallabies hoodoo gurus? This Wallabies side is quietly ticking off some hoodoos and records. The win at Twickenham was the first against England there since 2016, the Wales\u2019 win was a record, and victory over the Lions at Accor was the first win at Sydney Olympic Park in a decade. The win in Newcastle was a first, too. The Wallabies celebrate with the Ella Mobbs Cup after their victory. Credit: Getty Images The breakthrough win at Ellis Park now means the longest drought at a regular venue is Eden Park, at 39 years. The Wallabies play the All Blacks at Eden Park next month. That is all. Just leaving it there.\n\nFraser McReight is the world\u2019s best no.7 As far as a pure openside fetcher goes, it\u2019s hard to find anyone as good in the world game as Fraser McReight. His performance against the Boks continued a remarkable tradition of No.7s in gold, and his and names sits comfortably with Poidevin, Wilson, Waugh, Smith, Pocock and Hooper. Fraser McReight is world class. Credit: Getty Images Discipline is key As recently as three years ago, the Wallabies\u2019 discipline was the worst of any tier-one nation. They routinely conceded 12-13 penalties a game and lost at least one man to the sin-bin each game.\n\nLoading It pointed to a team that struggled for belief and was more often on the back foot than the front. That has changed dramatically under Schmidt and his obsession with strong fundamentals, particularly in the carry-clean. The Wallabies conceded just four penalties at Ellis Park, and have now gone seven straight Tests without a card; the longest since 2017. Depth is developing The Wallabies\u2019 depth has been a problem in recent years, but it is worth noting Schmidt\u2019s side claimed back-to-back wins against the British and Irish Lions and the Springboks without star forwards Rob Valetini and Allan Alaalatoa, their first two choices for the No.10 jersey and the first-choice No.9. And with a couple of hookers missing as well. Giteau law demise timely",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size When people first encounter the art of Charles Brooks, they\u2019re invariably impressed \u2013 if a little perplexed. Some of his works recall the grand pillars of ancient Roman architecture, or volcanic caves forged by fiery explosions. Others resemble the types of precious metals one expects to find inside a pirate\u2019s treasure chest, or old-fashioned rooms with peculiar Alice in Wonderland-style dimensions. Many admirers assume these images were created on a computer, perhaps with the aid of artificial intelligence. Some might mistake them for photorealist illustrations. Few realise they are actually photographs \u2013 and they all have one thing in common. Brooks, 47, is a Melbourne-based photographer who specialises in capturing the interiors of musical instruments. It\u2019s a highly technical endeavour that involves a laparoscope \u2013 a thin, tube-like camera used in keyhole surgery \u2013 in addition to multiple light sources, sophisticated editing software, infrared thermometers and sacks of rice. Brooks is the only person in this world who uses this technique, which he developed himself. Self-portrait by Charles Brooks, a former professional cellist who now specialises in photographing the interiors of musical instruments. Credit: Charles Brooks \u201cIt started during the COVID lockdowns,\u201d he explains when I visit him at his Hawthorn apartment to observe him at work. \u201cAll these musicians started losing jobs, so they decided to put their instruments into the repair shop. I took the opportunity to go in with my probe lenses and play around, but I never thought it would become a whole thing.\u201d When Brooks posted an early photo on Reddit, revealing the interior of a friend\u2019s 245-year-old cello, he expected to sell a handful of prints. But over the past few years, his extraordinary images have been reproduced an estimated 20 million times in newspapers and magazines across the world. What began as a niche pursuit is now his full-time occupation. In partnership with the Australian World Orchestra, which will perform Mahler\u2019s 4th and 5th symphonies in Melbourne and Sydney in September, Brooks is photographing two instruments on this crisp winter\u2019s morning: a cello, circa mid-1700s, and a viola made in the 1910s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAWO cellist Molly Kadarauch looks suitably nervous as she hands over her instrument, which was crafted by Pietro Antonio Testore, a member of Milan\u2019s highly regarded Testore family. \u201cI\u2019ve had it since 1989,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a couple of cracks, which devalued it, so it\u2019s been under extensive repair.\u201d Kadarauch breathes a sigh of relief when she learns that Brooks is a former professional musician himself, having held principal cello positions in China, Chile and Brazil. \u201cA didgeridoo is deliberately hollowed out by termites, which is why it looks like a cave,\u201d Brooks says. Credit: Charles Brooks He passes her cello to Bendigo-born violin maker Rainer Beilharz, who sets about cleaning its interior by pouring dry rice through the F-holes on either side of its bridge \u2013 so named because they resemble a cursive F \u2013 before gently shaking it and tipping the grains back out. \u201cStradivarius himself would have done this,\u201d Beilharz explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a time-honoured technique, which is why no one messes with it.\u201d Brooks places the cello on a felt-covered table, which is surrounded by three flash bulbs. He hands Kadarauch the thermometer gun, inserts his laparoscope \u2013 which he has modified to capture high-resolution images \u2013 and begins shooting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are intensely powerful lights, so they put out a lot of heat,\u201d he says as he instructs Kadarauch to alert him if the temperature nears 30 degrees. \u201cI have to wait eight to 10 seconds between each photograph so I don\u2019t boil the varnish.\u201d It\u2019s a painstaking process, requiring up to 300 individual photographs. Afterwards, he will stitch them together on his computer, allowing every detail to remain in sharp focus. \u201cI use all kinds of software to blend together the bits that are in focus, which is why parts of the image are angled,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably take me three hours just to do the photos, then another week to put them together.\u201d The interior of a 1717 Stradivarius violin, with an estimated value of $20 million. In reality, it\u2019s priceless. Credit: Charles Brooks As Australian World Orchestra violist Lisa Grosman awaits her turn, Brooks mentions that he recently photographed a 1717 Stradivarius, which is on loan to her AWO colleague, Daniel Dodds. \u201cIt\u2019s a $20 million violin, so you have to take every possible precaution,\u201d he says, explaining how Beilharz carefully dismantled the end pin, bridge, strings and tailpiece in preparation for the shoot. \u201cThese instruments are held together by tension instead of glue, because glue would dampen the vibrations. When I remove that tension, there\u2019s a chance the sound post \u2013 the dowel in the centre that transfers vibrations, which is often called the \u2018soul\u2019 of a violin \u2013 could just tip over. That\u2019s why I need a luthier [a maker of string instruments] to get everything precisely back in place, because even if you move something by a millimetre, it really changes the sound. \u201cThankfully, I\u2019ve never actually had one fall over.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrooks, who hails from New Zealand, began photographing the night sky about 10 years ago. \u201cAstrophotographers often want to capture the whole Milky Way, but it\u2019s hard to get in a single shot because it arches from one horizon to the other,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to move the lens this way and that, over and over. Now, I use those techniques when I\u2019m photographing instruments. In both cases, you\u2019re trying to uncover hidden spaces and show details that you wouldn\u2019t normally see.\u201d Over the years, Brooks has documented the interiors of grand pianos, flutes, guitars, pipe organs, saxophones, clarinets, French horns and even a didgeridoo. The interior of a Fazioli grand piano.
