    "text": "President Donald Trump posted an artificial intelligence-generated image of himself dressed as pope as the mourning of Pope Francis continues and just days before the conclave to elect his successor is set to begin.\n\nTrump's action drew rebukes from a group representing Catholic bishops in New York and among Italians.\n\nThe image, shared on Friday night (local time) on Trump's Truth Social site and later reposted by the White House on its official X account, raised eyebrows on social media and at the Vatican, which is still in the period of nine days of official mourning following Francis' death on April 21.\n\nTrump draws criticism with AI image of himself as the pope ahead of the papal conclave (Supplied)\n\nCatholic cardinals have been celebrating daily Masses in his memory and are due to open the conclave to elect his successor on Wednesday.\n\nThe death of a pope and election of another is a matter of utmost solemnity for Catholics, for whom the pope is Christ's vicar on Earth. That is all the more true in Italy, where the papacy is held in high esteem even by nonreligious Italians.\n\nThe image featuring Trump in a white cassock and pointed miter, or bishop's hat, was the topic of several questions during the Vatican's daily conclave briefing on Saturday.\n\nPope Francis's tomb seen for first time in images released by Vatican View Gallery\n\nItalian and Spanish news reports lamented its poor taste and said it was offensive, given that the period of official mourning is still under way.\n\nLeft-leaning former Premier Matteo Renzi said the image was shameful.\n\n\"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,\" Renzi wrote on X. \"Meanwhile, the US economy risks recession and the dollar loses value. The sovereignists are doing damage, everywhere.\"\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to comment.\n\nIn the United States, the New York State Catholic Conference, which represents the bishops of the state in working with government, accused Trump of mockery.\n\nREAD MORE: Federal Election 2025 Results Tracker\n\nPope Francis meets with President Donald Trump, left, on the occasion of their private audience, at the Vatican, May 24, 2017. (AP)\n\n\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,\" they wrote. \"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.\"\n\nItaly's left-leaning La Repubblica also featured the image on its homepage Saturday with a commentary accusing Trump of \"pathological megalomania.\"\n\nAsked to respond to the criticism, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that, \"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty.\"\n\nJack Posobiec, a prominent far-right influencer and Trump ally who recently participated in a Catholic prayer event in March at Trump's Florida resort, also defended the president.\n\nCardinals visit the tomb of the late Pope Francis inside St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome, Sunday, April 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) (AP)\n\n\"I'm Catholic. We've all been making jokes about the upcoming Pope selection all week. It's called a sense of humour,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe episode comes after Trump joked last week about his interest in the vacancy. \"I'd like to be pope. That would be my number one choice,\" the thrice married president, who is not Catholic, told reporters.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, piled on.\n\n\"I was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope. This would truly be a dark horse candidate, but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this possibility!\" Graham, R-S.C., wrote on X. \"The first Pope-US President combination has many upsides. Watching for white smoke\u2026. Trump MMXXVIII!\"\n\nVice President JD Vance, who is Catholic and was one of the last foreign officials to meet with Francis before the pope died, also joked about Secretary of State Marco Rubio becoming pope, suggesting Rubio could add it to the long list of titles he holds, including national security adviser and acting archivist.\n\nBeyond floating himself for the job, Trump also has put in a plug for Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.\n\n\"I have no preference. I must say, we have a cardinal that happens to be out a place called New York who's very good. So we'll see what happens,\" he said.\n\nDolan, 75, is one of 10 US cardinals who will be voting in the conclave, but Trump's pitch might have cost Dolan support.\n\nClergy follow the funeral of Pope Francis in St Peter's Square at the Vatican, on Saturday, April 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)\n\nThe reason conclaves are held in secrecy, with cardinals sequestered for the duration, is to prevent outside secular powers from influencing their choice, as occurred in centuries past.\n\nThere is an old saying about campaigning for the job of pope or of being promoted excessively, especially by outsiders: If you \"enter a conclave as pope, you leave as a cardinal.\"\n\nWhile Trump attended Francis' funeral, he and Vance have clashed with US bishops in general and Francis in particular over the administration's hard line stance on immigration and its efforts to deport migrants en masse. Right before he was hospitalised in February for pneumonia, Francis issued a strong rebuke of the administration's mass deportation plans and Vance's theological justification of it.\n\nOver 12 years as pope, Francis tried to remake the US Catholic hierarchy more in his image, elevating pastors who prioritised social justice and migration issues over culture warriors who were more favoured by his more doctrinaire predecessors St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI. A new pope who is more conservative could reverse that effort.\n\nTrump has nominated as his ambassador to the Holy See Brian Burch, whose Catholicvote.org has been aggressively covering the pre-conclave days at the Vatican. It was one of the main disseminators in English-speaking media of a report, flatly and officially denied by the Vatican, that Cardinal Pietro Parolin had had a health scare this past week that required medical attention.\n\nParolin was the secretary of state under Francis and is seen as a leading contender to be pope. He is also the main architect of the Vatican's China policy and its controversial 2018 deal with Beijing over bishop nominations -- a deal that the was sharply criticised by the first Trump administration.",

    "text": "Revered investor Warren Buffett has shocked an arena full of his shareholders by announcing that he wants to retire at the end of the year.\n\nBuffett said he would recommend to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s board on Sunday (Monday AEST) that vice chairman Greg Abel should replace him.\n\n\u201cI think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,\u201d Buffett said.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett. (AP)\n\nAbel has been Buffett's designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed that he would not take over until after Buffett's death. Previously the 94-year-old Buffett always said he had no plans to retire.\n\nBuffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question and answer period without taking any questions about it.\n\nHe said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett.\n\nAbel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning.\n\nREAD MORE: Federal Election 2025 Results Tracker\n\nWarren Buffet, (right), and Bill Gates (left). (AP)\n\nAbel returned an hour later without Buffett to conduct the company's formal business meeting, and he responded to the news.\n\n\u201cI just want to say I couldn\u2019t be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,\u201d Abel said.\n\nMany investors said Abel would do a good job running Berkshire, but it remained to be seen how good he would be at investing Berkshire's cash.\n\nBuffett endorsed him on Saturday by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.\n\nThe world's top 10 richest people for 2025 View Gallery\n\n\u201cI have no intention \u2014 zero \u2014 of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,\u201d Buffett said.\n\n\u201cThe decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg\u2019s management than mine.\u201d\n\nThousands of investors in the Omaha arena gave Buffett a prolonged standing ovation after his announcement in recognition of his 60 years leading the company.\n\nCFRA research analyst Cathy Seifert said it had to be hard for Buffett to reach this decision to step down.\n\n\u201cThis was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI think there will be an effort at maintaining a \u2018business as usual\u2019 environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.\u201d\n\nAbel expected to do well\n\nIn many respects, Abel has already been running much of the company for years.\n\nBut he hasn't been managing Berkshire's insurance operations or deciding where to invest all of its cash.\n\nHe will now take those tasks on, but vice chairman Ajit Jain will remain to help oversee the insurance companies.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Greg Abel is seen at the CenturyLink Centre in Omaha, Neb., on May 5, 2018. (AP)\n\nInvestment manager Omar Malik of Hosking Partners in London said before Buffett\u2019s announcement that he wasn\u2019t worried about Berkshire\u2019s future under Abel.\n\n\u201cNot really (worried). He\u2019s had such a long time alongside Warren and a chance to know the businesses,\u201d Malik said about Abel. \"The question is will he allocate capital as dynamically as Warren? And the answer is no. But I think he\u2019ll do a fine job with the support of the others.\u201d\n\nCole Smead of Smead Capital Management said he wasn't surprised Buffett was stepping down after watching him on Saturday because the 94-year-old wasn't as sharp as in past years.\n\nAt one point, he made a basic math mistake in one of his answers. At other points, he got off track while telling stories about Berkshire and his investing without answering the question he was asked.\n\nAbel is well regarded by Berkshire's managers and Buffett has praised his business acumen for years. But he will have a hard time matching Buffett's legendary performance, and since he doesn't control 30 per cent of Berkshire's stock like Buffett does, he won't have as much leeway.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge he\u2019s going to have is if anyone is going to give him Buffett or (former Vice Chairman Charlie) Munger\u2019s pass card? Not a chance in God\u2019s name,\" Smead said.\n\nBuffett always enjoyed a devoted following among shareholders.\n\nBuffett has said that Abel might even be a more hands-on manager than he was and get more out of Berkshire\u2019s companies. Managers within the company say they have to be well prepared before talking to Abel because they know he will ask tough questions.\n\nSteven Check, president of Check Capital Management, said he never thought he would see Buffett retire.\n\n\u201cI didn't think he would retire while his mind is still working so well, nor did I think it'd happen at the annual meeting,\u201d Check said. \u201cBut overall I'm very happy for him.\u201d\n\nBuffett earlier warned that Trump's tariffs were harmful\n\nEarlier Saturday, Buffett warned of dire global consequences from President Donald Trump's tariffs while telling the thousands of investors gathered at his annual meeting that \u201ctrade should not be a weapon\u201d but \"there's no question that trade can be an act of war\".\n\nBuffett said Trump's trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don\u2019t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,\u201d Buffett said as he addressed the topic on everyone's mind at the start of the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event about investing in America in the Cross Hall of the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (AP)\n\nWhile Buffett said it was best for trade to be balanced between countries, he did not think Trump was going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world would be safer if more countries were prosperous.\n\nMarket turmoil doesn't create big opportunities\n\nBuffett said he just did not see many attractively priced investments that he understood these days, so Berkshire was sitting on $US347.7 billion ($538.4 billion) in cash, but he predicted that one day Berkshire would be \u201cbombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for\".\n\nBuffett said the recent turmoil in the markets that generated headlines after Trump's tariff announcement last month was \"really nothing\".\n\nHe dismissed the recent drop as relatively small. He cited when the Dow Jones industrial average went from 240 on the day he was born in 1930 down to 41 during the Great Depression as a truly significant drop in the markets. Currently the Dow Jones Industrial Average sits at 41,317.43.\n\n\u201cThis has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,\" he said.\n\nBuffett said he had not bought back any of Berkshire's shares this year either because they did not seem to be a bargain.\n\nInvestor Chris Bloomstran, who is president of Semper Augustus Investments Group, told the Gabelli investment conference on Friday that a financial crisis might be the best thing for Berkshire because it would create opportunities to invest at attractive prices.\n\n\u201cBerkshire needs a crisis. I mean Berkshire thrives in crisis,\u201d Bloomstran said.\n\nBerkshire meeting attracts thousands\n\nThe meeting attracts some 40,000 people every year who want to hear from Buffett, including some celebrities and well-known investors.\n\nThis year, Hillary Rodham Clinton also attended. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly because he has shied away from politics and any controversial topic in recent years for fear of hurting Berkshire\u2019s businesses.\n\nOne investor even camped outside the arena overnight to be first in line.\n\nDevan Bisher, 72, said he had faith in Berkshire's future and did not plan to sell the stock he started buying in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good train to ride,\u201d Bisher said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to stay with it.\u201d",

(Supplied)\n\n\ufeffMore than twice as many romance novels were sold in 2024 compared to 2019 and Australians spent more than $50 million on the genre last year.\n\nRomance \ufeffhas also been growing at an average annual rate of 49 per cent for the last three years, suggesting the figures could be even higher in 2025.\n\nAnnabel and Eliza, the organisers behind the Bound to Roam book crawl last weekend, made sure a romance store was their last stop for that very reason.\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\n\"All day our guests were saying they couldn't wait to go to [...] that they were saving their purchases for the female owned small business,\" Annabel told 9news.\n\nRomancing The Novel owner Scarlett Hopper, who is also a romance author, said she has BookTok (TikTok's book community) to thank for the boom in business.\n\nThe rise of online communities like BookTok has lessened the stigma around romance fiction, which was once considered \"taboo\" and has been dismissed as frivolous and shallow for decades.\n\nThe stigma is largely rooted in misogyny\ufeff, as romance is a genre predominantly written by and for women, but social media has shifted the narrative over the last five years.\n\nScarlett Hopper is a romance author and runs Sydney romance bookstore Romancing The Novel. (Instagram/@romancing.the.novel)\n\n\"Romance has always had a place in the world, people just haven't acknowledged it.\ufeff Now I think women are taking back the power,\" Hopper told 9news.\n\nThat's reflected in her sales, which have been high ever since she opened her Paddington store in September 2024.\n\n\ufeffSome of her regulars travel hours just to visit the store each weekend and many spend hundreds of dollars each time they drop in.\n\n\"It shows how much books mean to people, especially women\ufeff,\" she said.\n\nAnd Romancing The Novel is not the only store benefiting from the boom in romance book sales.\ufeff\n\nCaitlyn, owner of A Thousand Lives\ufeff Book Haven in the Yarra Valley, told 9news that \"people have been spending more and more on books\" over the last 18 months.\n\nREAD MORE: New autopsy reveals exactly how Gene Hackman died\n\nCaitlyn (left) with an author at one of A Thousand Lives Book Haven's reader events.

Masen.\n\nAuthor Kat T. Masen's romance novel went viral on TikTok before she opened her store Books Ever After in Bowral. (Instagram/@authorkattmasen)\n\nShe realised the power of BookTok when her novel Chasing Love went viral and opened the store soon after in 2023.\n\nWithin a year, it had caught the attention of streaming giant Netflix.\n\n\"It was really my heavy presence on TikTok that pushed the store to the next level,\" Masen told 9news.\n\nNetflix \ufeffinvited her to be part of the festivities when hit series Bridgerton came to Bowral for its season three press tour in April last year, sparking a huge spike in sales and online interest for the small business.\n\nOne year on, she's already planning \ufeffto open a second location after proving with her first that \"brick and mortar is still very much alive\".\n\nEspecially since the interest rate cuts in February, which Masen said sparked a spike in spending from her Australian customers.\n\nOnline sales from US c\ufeffustomers have dipped due to US President Donald Trump's tariffs but that just gives Masen more incentive to grow her business locally while the romance boom continues.\n\nPanic on Wall Street as Trump announces new tariffs View Gallery\n\nNielsen BookScan's international book markets report showed that romance was one of the fiction genre with the strongest growth in 2024 and that's expected to continue in 2025.\n\nPhysical bookshop purchases rose above pre-pandemic levels, with more than half of Nielsen BookScan's tracked markets showing an increase in print book sales volume compared to 2023.\n\n\"For all of the people saying romance books are dead, my sales record proves otherwise,\" Caitlyn said.\n\nMeanwhile, romance readers are lapping it up and Annabel and Eliza have already locked in another book crawl in June with an even bigger turnout expected.\ufeff",

    "text": "Ousted one-term Liberal MP from Melbourne's east, Keith Wolahan, has called on his party to focus on urban Australians after a resounding electoral loss in Victoria and across the nation.\n\nMr Wolahan, who held one of the party's few metropolitan Melbourne seats, has lost his seat to Labor's Gabriel Ng.\n\n\"It was clear our party has an issue with people in urban Australia, which is where most people live,\" he told the ABC's Insiders program on Sunday.\n\n\"We need to turn our mind to that like we never have before.\"\n\nMr Wolahan said holding the seat for three years was the honour of his life but he stopped short of officially conceding defeat.\n\nThe Liberal Party has been reduced to a handful of seats across the Melbourne region, with Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's goal to attract votes from outer suburban Victorian voters having failed.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese's landslide election victory on Saturday night has delivered Labor swings across the country, not least in Victoria, where the Liberal Party had high electoral hopes.\n\n\"We need to acknowledge the cities that we live in, not the cities that we used to live in, or think we live in,\" Mr Wolahan said.\n\n\"Because there's a lack of metropolitan members in the party room, I think we need the rural and regional members \u2014 who I have great respect for and I admire them and they have done an amazing job \u2014 to put themselves in the shoes of Australians who live in an urban area.\n\n\"We can't just go off perception, we have to go off the perspective of someone else\"\n\nMr Wolahan said he hoped the Liberal Party's electoral review would be \"serious\" and \"comprehensive\".\n\nAnother key upset for the Liberals has occurred in the eastern Melbourne electorate of Deakin, where MP Michael Sukkar has lost his seat to a more than 4 per cent swing to Labor's Matt Gregg.\n\nThe Liberals are also facing disappointment in the seat of Aston in Melbourne's east.\n\nThe formerly safe Liberal seat turned red in a surprise win for Labor's Mary Doyle at a 2023 by-election, and it appears she has once again triumphed, with Liberal hopeful Manny Cicchiello trailing behind.\n\nLiberal MP for the seat of Wannon in the state's west, Dan Tehan, said on Saturday evening his party would have to have a \"root and branch look at everything that's occurred\".\n\nPremier ties federal Labor's success to state issues\n\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allan said the election results were an emphatic win for the broader Labor movement and the nation.\n\nShe said voters had recognised Labor's focus on working families, road and rail infrastructure and construction projects.\n\n\"The results yesterday, they're not despite what's going on here in Victoria, they're because of what's going on here in Victoria \u2014 that focus on building, on homes, on Airport Rail, Suburban Rail Loop, that focus on families in their hospital and education care, and the focus on providing meaningful cost of living support.\n\n\"Victorians know that that's what we stand for, Victorians know that's what federal Labor stands for and they also know that in Anthony Albanese and in my government, we will fight for them every single day.\"\n\nBut the seat of Bendigo \u2014 the premier's hometown \u2014 is piquing interest as its result bucks the broader trend in Labor\u2019s favour.\n\nThere are an estimated 1290 votes between sitting MP Lisa Chester, who had held the seat at a margin of 11.9 per cent, and Nationals candidate Andrew Lethlean.\n\nIn Kooyong in the city's inner east, teal independent Dr Monique Ryan has retained her seat off Liberal hopeful Amelia Hamer with a clear win.\n\n\"We've been able to, in three years, I think, put together a body of work which has shown the community of Kooyong that it's worth having independent representation,\" she told her supporters on Saturday night.\n\nVictorian seats in doubt\n\nThe seat of Wills, in Melbourne's north, remains tight with Labor's Peter Khalil in the lead.\n\nThe Greens were hopeful of picking up the seat with the help of the profile of former Victorian party leader Samantha Ratnam.\n\nSema, a Wills voter, told the ABC on Sunday morning the election result was \"a really strong statement from the country\".\n\nShe said the result was a response to \"Trump-style politics happening elsewhere\".\n\n\"I don't think anyone expected the landslide,\" Sema said.\n\n\"I think people maybe thought a minority government. So I'm incredibly proud\".\n\nThe neighbouring seat of Melbourne remains too close to call due to a 5 per cent swing towards Labor.\n\nMelbourne MP and national Greens leader Adam Bandt is slightly ahead of Labor's Sarah Witty with about two-thirds of votes counted.\n\nIn Goldstein in Melbourne's inner south, incumbent teal independent MP Zoe Daniel celebrated success on Saturday night but Liberal rival Tim Wilson has not yet conceded defeat.\n\n\"The Liberal Party threw everything at us \u2026 and we are standing here to celebrate,\" she told her supporters to rapturous applause.\n\nThe ABC vote count indicates a win for Ms Daniel is likely, however, there are more than 20,000 votes yet to be counted.\n\nGoldstein independent MP Zoe Daniel claimed victory on Saturday night, however her Liberal rival Tim Wilson has not yet conceded defeat. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nIn the seat of Flinders on the Mornington Peninsula, the AEC abandoned its Liberal-Labor preference count to look at preferences between Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie and independent Ben Smith, which remain on a knife edge.\n\nThere are 15 vote-counting centres in Victoria, with counting set to resume on Sunday morning.",

Michael Slezak looks at the impact of a proposed federal regulator, in light of how land clearing is managed in Australia.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Defenders Office, proving an offence beyond reasonable doubt can be \"difficult to do, so it is more common for regulators to issue Penalty Infringement Notices (PINs) for less serious offences\".\n\nThe maximum penalty for a PIN is $15,000 for a corporation or $5,000 for an individual.\n\nDr Maron said education and effective enforcement were needed to reduce clearing rates.\n\n\"A lack of awareness and appropriate penalties are all missing pieces of the puzzle,\" she said.\n\n\"Achieving a shift really involves working with the people who are managing the land.\"",

(AP: Josh Funk)\n\nMr Abel has been Mr Buffett's designated successor for years and he already manages all of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, but it was always assumed he wouldn't take over until after Mr Buffett's death.\n\nMr Buffett's success, coupled with his ability to explain his thinking in clear soundbites, has made him highly influential in the business and financial communities, earning him the nickname \"The Oracle of Omaha\".\n\nThe 94-year-old billionaire announced the news at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer period and didn't take any further questions about the revelation.\n\nHe said the only board members who knew the move was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Mr Abel \u2014 who was sitting next to Buffett on stage \u2014 was given no warning.\n\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation will lose its biggest donor in death Photo shows An elderly white man wearing a suit and red tie walks next to several microphones The billionaire investor and philanthropist's donations to the world's largest private charity, begun by the Microsoft founder and his former wife, will end with his death.\n\nMr Buffett also added that he believed the board of directors would be \"unanimously in favour of\" his recommendation.\n\nAbout an hour later, Mr Abel came out to oversee the formal Berkshire business meeting without Mr Buffett, and he addressed the announcement.\n\n\"I just want to say I couldn't be more humbled and honoured to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,\" he said.\n\nMr Buffett transformed Berkshire Hathaway from a medium-sized textile company when he bought it in the 1960s into a giant conglomerate, now valued at more than $US1 trillion ($1.54t) and with liquid assets of $US300 billion.\n\nShareholders queued outside Omaha's CHI Health Center before attending Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. (AP: Rebecca S Gratz)\n\nThe company on Saturday reported first-quarter profits of $US9.6 billion, down 14 per cent. That works out to $US4.47 per share, also down sharply.\n\nMr Buffett's net worth as of Saturday is $US168.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine's real-time rich list.\n\nAnalysts expect Abel to do well at Berkshire helm\n\nMany investors have said they believed Mr Abel would do a good job running Berkshire, but it remained to be seen how good he would be at investing Berkshire's cash.\n\nMr Buffett also endorsed him on Saturday by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.\n\nAnalysts issue warning as more Australians dive into Wall Street Photo shows person who is blurred walks in front of the new york stock exchange, sign says wall street Analysts point to optimism about the US economy, but much will ride on decision made by incoming US president-elect Donald Trump, and the direction of interest rates both here in Australia and overseas.\n\n\"I have no intention \u2014 zero \u2014 of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,\" Mr Buffett said.\n\n\"The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg's management than mine.\"\n\nThousands of investors in the Omaha arena gave Mr Buffett a prolonged standing ovation after his announcement in recognition of his 60 years leading the company.\n\nCFRA research analyst Cathy Seifert said it had to be hard for Mr Buffett to reach this decision to step down.\n\n\"This was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,\" Ms Seifert said.\n\n\" I think there will be an effort at maintaining a 'business as usual' environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined. \"\n\nIn many respects, Mr Abel has already been running much of the company for years, but he hasn't been managing Berkshire's insurance operations or deciding where to invest all of its cash.\n\nHe will now take those tasks on, but vice-chairman Ajit Jain will remain to help oversee the insurance companies.\n\nInvestment manager Omar Malik of Hosking Partners in London said before Mr Buffett's announcement that he wasn't worried about Berkshire's future under Mr Abel.\n\n\"Not really [worried]. He's had such a long time alongside Warren and a chance to know the businesses,\" Mr Malik said.\n\nCole Smead of Smead Capital Management said he wasn't surprised Mr Buffett was stepping down after watching him on Saturday because the 94-year-old wasn't as sharp as in past years.\n\nAt one point, Mr Buffett made a basic mathematical mistake in one of his answers. At other points, he got off-track while telling stories about Berkshire and his investing without answering the question he was asked.\n\nMr Abel is well-regarded by Berkshire's managers and Mr Buffett has praised his business acumen for years.\n\nAnalysts expect, however, that he will have a hard time matching the billionaire's legendary performance, in part because he doesn't control 30 per cent of Berkshire's stock like Mr Buffett does and therefore won't have as much leeway.\n\n\"I think the challenge he's going to have is if anyone is going to give him Buffett or [former vice-chairman Charlie] Munger's pass card? Not a chance in God's name,\" Mr Smead said.\n\nMr Buffett has said that Mr Abel might even be a more hands-on manager than he is and get more out of Berkshire's companies.\n\n\"I think we'll get a more hands-on manager and that could be a good thing,\" said Steven Check, who runs Check Capital Management.\n\nAP/AFP",

    "text": "There was shock on the ABC election panel when the results started coming in.\n\n\"Remarkable\" and \"extraordinary\" were some of the words used to describe what was happening in Tasmania on election night.\n\nIt was something no-one saw coming \u2014 not the Liberals who thought they would defend their own seats and maybe, just maybe, pick up one, and not even Labor dared dream it would go this well.\n\nBut when the music stopped, the Liberals were left without a single seat and a lot of questions to answer.\n\nLabor MP Julie Collins (centre) cheers at the Labor Party function at Bellerive Yacht Club. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nLet's wind back a bit first. To that weird pseudo campaign period.\n\nGoing into the election there was a general feeling that the traditionally Liberal-supporting electorates of Bass and Braddon would likely stay blue, although it was a bit of a never-say-never vibe.\n\nCertainly there was consideration that Labor might just sneak across the line in Braddon due to well-known former Labor senator Anne Urquhart taking on lesser-known Liberal candidate Mal Hingston.\n\nLabor mounted a successful campaign with Ms Urquhart switching from the Senate to the lower house. (ABC News: Mackenzie Heard)\n\nAnne Urquhart stepped away from a federal upper house seat to contest the seat of Braddon. (ABC News: Jordan Young)\n\nAt 1.4 per cent, Bass was always very marginal, but there was a sense the Liberals' Bridget Archer stood a chance based purely on her personal popularity.\n\nAs for Lyons, it was viewed as a close contest between the Liberals' Susie Bower and former state leader Rebecca White. Although many believed Ms White would manage to retain the seat.\n\nBut Labor didn't just sneak across the line, they steamrolled the Liberal candidates with huge swings in each of those three electorates, far larger than the national average.\n\nThree swings of more than 10 per cent.\n\nWith Labor likely claiming four seats and Andrew Wilkie the fifth, it means there won't be a spot of blue on that map of Tasmania.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nIs Labor just fantastically popular on the island state? Its state counterparts aren't.\n\nAre the Liberals on the nose or was there something else at play?\n\nLet's start with the salmon factor.\n\nAlbanese plants pro-jobs flag on salmon issue\n\nShortly before the election, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese quickly passed law changes aimed at protecting salmon jobs. (ABC News: Glenn Dickson)\n\nIt was an issue that played out across the state in different ways.\n\nIn the south there was a groundswell of community opposition in the wake of a mass mortality event that saw fat globules washing up on south-eastern Tasmanian beaches.\n\nTasmanian salmon have been dying in a mass mortality event. (Supplied: Bob Brown Foundation)\n\nProtesters gathered at beaches and on parliament lawns as they urged others to \"vote salmon out\" with an anti-salmon farming candidate challenging Labor MP Julie Collins.\n\nBut at the other end of the state there was a perception the Albanese government was \"anti-worker\" and had left the industry in uncertainty, as the federal environment minister worked out whether she needed to review salmon farming operations on the state's west coast.\n\nOn the precipice of calling the election, Mr Albanese took decisive action and moved to amend the nation's environment laws to create a carve out for the salmon industry at Macquarie Harbour.\n\nAssessment of fish farming in Macquarie Harbour still 'active' Photo shows Aerial view of salmon pens and boat in coastal waterway. The future of salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour is still under \"active\" assessment by the federal government, despite the passing of laws designed to nullify the issue.\n\nIt infuriated environment groups who gathered at Canberra Parliament House to voice their opposition.\n\nIt was a gamble, given the salmon industry only accounts for 120 jobs in that area.\n\nBut it was always about much more than those few jobs, it was signalling to workers across the country that the party was pro jobs.\n\nAnd it paid off.\n\nBut in the south, the anti-salmon vote ate into the Labor stronghold of Franklin with a decent swing against Labor, in favour of anti-salmon campaigner independent Peter George.\n\nAnti-salmon farming campaigner Peter George is second on first preference votes in the seat of Franklin. (ABC News: Meg Whitfield)\n\nConsidering it was Labor's only non-marginal seat in Tasmania going into the night and by the end it was the only one that hadn't been called, the party might be smart to heed the warning.\n\nThere was another 'anti-factor' in play across the state though.\n\nThe other, worked in Labor's favour. The anti-Dutton factor.\n\nTasmanians didn't warm to Peter Dutton, who lost his own Queensland seat on election night. (ABC News: Matt Roberts )\n\nAntony Green set the gold standard for election analysis Photo shows ABC election expert Antony Green smiles at the camera with his hands clasped behind his back. Antony Green has covered every single state and federal election that I have been alive for. He makes it all seem effortless. But I know how hard he's worked to be ready for May 3.\n\nWhen the rest of the country went red last election, Tasmania bucked the trend. The northern electorates stayed blue and the Liberals' Susie Bower very nearly stole Lyons from Labor, leaving it on a margin of 0.9 per cent.\n\nTurns out Tasmanians, in particular those in the electorate of Bass, were Scott Morrison fans. That didn't translate to Peter Dutton.\n\nIn fact, the feedback door-knocking candidates regularly got was that they really didn't like Mr Dutton and at times that was enough to flip their vote.\n\nAnd both major parties knew it. Labor even played on it. Reminding people that if they voted for the well-liked Bass Liberal MP Bridget Archer, they'd ultimately get Mr Dutton.\n\nThe Liberals' Bridget Archer lost her seat. (ABC News: Jonathan Mcnee)\n\nState Liberals on the nose\n\nBut perhaps the former opposition leader isn't the only one Tasmanian voters were punishing.\n\nThe state Liberals are limping on in minority government in their fourth term.\n\nAnd it's pretty easy to come up with a list of things that are starting to really irk Tasmanians \u2014 the economy, the health system, that time they organised two brand new Spirit of Tasmania ferries but didn't get around to building a berth.\n\nAnd then there's the stadium.\n\nTasmanian Liberal Premier Jeremy Rockliff has hitched his legacy to building an AFL stadium in Hobart. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nThe proposed AFL stadium on Hobart's waterfront at Macquarie Point is almost entirely a state issue. There's of course the matter of federal funding but that's technically tied to the precinct.\n\nSure the stadium has its supporters, but if the polls are anything to go by, far more people oppose it, particularly those in the northern half of the state.\n\nPeople are furious, but that's not stopping the state Liberal government, who appear determined to see it built no matter what.\n\nYes, this is a state issue, but when you ask a Tasmanian about what they care about this election, it often crops up.\n\nCould it be that the federal Liberals have copped some of the backlash intended for their state counterparts?\n\nThe result was even better than some in Labor predicted. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nIn the end though they only have themselves to blame and as far as they're concerned, the picture isn't pretty.\n\nIn Bass, the Liberals have lost a well-liked MP to a lesser-known Labor candidate.\n\nRebecca White has not only defended Lyons for Labor, but increased the party's margin.\n\nFormer state Labor leader Rebecca White made to switch to federal politics, nabbing the seat of Lyons. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nAnd the only seat the Liberals held that wasn't marginal has been well and truly claimed by Ms Urquhart.\n\nWhatever the reason for the Liberal wipe-out, and there are no doubt a myriad of factors, the Liberals are going to have a lot of lessons to learn if they want to have a presence in the state again.\n\nAnne Urquhart celebrates her election win at an event in Ulverstone.

    "text": "To its accidental credit, Seven got the tone right for Coalition supporters, offering up something called a Situation Room, and a so-called \u201celection needle\u201d. Liberal senator Jane Hume, who looked inclined to enter one to plunge the other into the eyeballs of fellow panellists Tanya Plibersek and Bill Shorten, spent a goodly part of the night reminding viewers that the contest wasn\u2019t over because pre-polls and postal votes accounted for up to 50 per cent of the vote. When it became apparent that even the boss was headed for a Centrelink queue, she changed tack, accusing them of dancing on Peter Dutton\u2019s political grave: \u201cYou are feeding on the entrails before the chicken is gutted!\u201d she shrieked.\n\nSpeaking of catastrophic messes, Nine\u2019s Dunk Tank looked like a thought bubble generated by a malfunctioning, AI-generated, political science graduate after a particularly heavy night on the turps. If you covered a 1990s arcade skill-tester with a roll of Bunnings contact in a fetching shade of fake wood, you\u2019d go part of the way to explaining the device that was used to \u201cdunk\u201d MPs who\u2019d lost their seats earlier in the day. So far, so hilarious, no? To their eternal credit, all the network\u2019s panellists looked mildly mortified, with the ALP\u2019s Chris Bowen jumping in to remind the chortling masses that politicians were actual people with actual feelings and that, in fact, forced unemployment wasn\u2019t especially funny anyway.\n\nAlly Langdon and Peter Overton headed up Nine\u2019s election night coverage.\n\nAt the Ten network, nobody was laughing either, although that might\u2019ve had something to do with the eyeball-dryingly dull commentary proffered by the pink-clad teal, Kylea Tink. She spent much of the night earnestly explaining why the Coalition\u2019s policies weren\u2019t resonating with voters to Liberal senator Dave Sharma. He, in turn, was giving off the air of a distracted parent pretending to listen to one of his kids, nodding at timed intervals whilst frantically doomscrolling on the phone.\n\nAnd that, friends, brings us to Sky News, where Peta Credlin\u2019s magnificent eyebrows were given the workout to end all workouts as she contemplated the Coalition\u2019s shockingly quick demise. After using Labor\u2019s Murray Watt for a casual spot of target practice (\u201cyour mouth is writing cheques that your brain can\u2019t cash\u201d, she snapped), she and her fellow panellists embarked upon an impromptu autopsy. The result, they declared, was inevitable, given that the Coalition were up against (in no particular order): history, Donald Trump and Labor\u2019s lies, vote-thieving teals and Greens, and political traitors of assorted other shades.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Dayne Zorko spent two years stifling a laugh each time he fronted the media and cameras as questions about retirement kept coming to the Brisbane Lions star. Yet here he stands: defying Father Time as a premiership champion, and showing no signs of suffering a dramatic fade any time soon. Zorko does not believe his heroics are a flash in the pan: he is adamant the evolution of sport science will make such exploits the norm. The 36-year-old became the oldest player to claim an All Australian blazer last year, doing so in his new position of halfback as he sought comprehensive medical support within and outside the club. In 2025, the performance that helped end Brisbane\u2019s 21-year title drought has continued. His 34 disposals, seven rebound 50s, three inside 50s, and three clearances in the Lions\u2019 most recent triumph of St Kilda showcased just how much he still has to offer as he heads into Sunday\u2019s QClash against the Suns. Dayne Zorko celebrates the Brisbane Lions\u2019 2024 premiership triumph. Credit: Getty Images But when asked if 40 might become the new 30, with older players inking longer-term deals, Zorko suppressed a giggle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs you get older, you probably want to spend less time on the track and just want to play, but I\u2019ve prided my whole career on training as much as I can. That\u2019s how you get better, that\u2019s how you stay in touch,\u201d said Zorko, who comes off contract this year. \u201cI think going forward, we\u2019re going to see a lot more players play up until they\u2019re 35, 36, 37, maybe even into their 40s. \u201cYou can\u2019t replace experience. One thing all the guys still playing well into their 30s in the competition have got is really good experience in big games, finals, and they know what it takes to be a professional athlete. \u201cI don\u2019t know about multi-year deals, but if the player wants to play on, I can\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d But the evolution of sport science and player welfare, and the way it is extending careers, is not limited to the AFL. In rugby union, Wallabies prop James Slipper has become the nation\u2019s most capped player, with former teammate Scott Higginbotham praising him as one of the game\u2019s most \u201cdurable\u201d athletes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the perfect word: durable,\u201d Higginbotham says. \u201cHe\u2019s achieved a lot over his whole career, it\u2019s been achievement after achievement. It\u2019s amazing that he\u2019s still playing.\u201d In the NRL, Brisbane Broncos skipper Adam Reynolds is plotting to play on in 2026, having produced one of the finest games of his career against the Bulldogs. Gold Coast Titans veteran Kieran Foran has also refused to rule out playing beyond 2025, despite turning 35 in June. Kieran Foran has refused to rule out playing beyond 2025. Credit: Getty Images Now in his 17th preseason, the stalwart of 303 NRL and 31 Test appearances revealed he had undergone 17 operations for various leg and shoulder injuries \u2013 even getting \u201ca new ankle\u201d late last year. It came after a 2024 season in which he made more tackles (433) and kick metres (6235) than at any stage in his career, while only twice previously bettering his 15 try assists. Before suffering a biceps injury in the Titans\u2019 final preseason trial against the Dolphins, which he is expected to return from in May, Foran declared he still had \u201cplenty left in the tank\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe high-performance side of things is forever evolving, but ... it comes back to putting in the hard work and making sure you\u2019re doing everything you can to keep up with this current crop of players,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still loving it as much now as I was 16 years ago, so it\u2019s great to still be pushing myself and being involved in this game.\u201d According to sports science expert Dr Jonathon Weakley, the ability to prolong careers goes back to the strides taken in strength and conditioning practices during an athlete\u2019s formative years. Loading Weakley, who alongside other professionals at Leeds Beckett University were instrumental in transforming the England Rugby Union\u2019s athlete pathways, told this masthead the growth of sports science could be best illustrate by the change of props in the 15-man code. Where players in those positions two decades ago would weigh about \u201c111 to 114 kilograms\u201d, they now push 130 kilograms, enhancing their capacity to withstand contact and handle injuries. \u201cThey\u2019re the same stature, but they\u2019ve essentially put on 15 kilograms, and that\u2019s because they\u2019ve had more time to accumulate that mass and accumulate strength,\u201d Weakley said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot many would have been able to squat 200 kilograms at the turn of the century. Now we\u2019ve got players like Fletcher Newell \u2013 who\u2019s in the squad of the All Blacks \u2013 and they\u2019re squatting close to 300 kilograms in their teenage years. \u201cAfter a while, it\u2019s not freakish, it just becomes the norm. Strength fundamentally mitigates injury, it enhances recovery, and it improves performance on the field \u2013 they are undeniable facts. \u201cIf we implement good, proper strength and conditioning from a young age, we have a greater opportunity to enhance things like strength and power.\u201d While the Australian Catholic University associate professor believes the extension of careers will be in small increments, the lengthening of a player\u2019s peak period will grow as a result of their improved conditioning. Loading \u201cWhat we have seen is players being able to play for longer because they had a greater training base, we\u2019re more aware of injuries and how to treat them, the nutritional considerations around recovery, and things like sleep,\u201d Weakley said. \u201cIt might be one to three years, but that lengthening of that window of peak performance might be why we\u2019re feeling like players\u2019 careers are lengthening.\n\nAdvertisement",

Even more important was the hurricane-like return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nCyclone Donald made landfall in Canada last week, delivering the centre-left Liberal Party a fourth-term victory that seemed impossible at the start of this year. Then he crashed through Australia\u2019s electoral map, demolishing the Coalition\u2019s hopes of victory. The parallels between the two countries, both close American allies, are unmistakable. Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre lost not just the election but his own seat, as did Peter Dutton.\n\nLocal factors at play in this election \u2013 Dutton\u2019s woeful campaign, Albanese\u2019s astuteness, interest rates beginning to fall \u2013 were all crucial. But around the world, Albanese\u2019s victory will be interpreted as a repudiation of Trumpism and the latest sign of a revival of social democratic politics.\n\nTrump\u2019s radical and in many ways frightening return to office has breathed new life into centre-left parties.\n\nThe turnaround from the beginning of this year has been rapid and remarkable. As Trump\u2019s second inauguration approached on January 20, centre-left parties were grasping for relevance. In an era of high inflation, incumbency had become a curse and left-wing governments were in an especially grim position. Conservative populism was in the ascendancy. Canada\u2019s progressive prince, Justin Trudeau, announced his retirement in January as a beleaguered, unpopular figure. Labor was falling behind the Coalition in the polls, raising the likelihood of a Dutton prime ministership.\n\n\u201cSocial democratic parties across the world are in disarray,\u201d Emma Dawson, the head of the progressive Per Capita think tank, said in January. Public intellectual Clive Hamilton, who founded the left-wing Australia Institute, argued, \u201cthere is clearly something profound going on\u201d in global politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that social democratic parties are struggling to sustain their votes,\u201d Hamilton said.",

    "text": "This comment could be construed as a veiled swipe at his former club, the Western Bulldogs. The Bulldogs had hosted Port Adelaide in Ballarat before a miserly 4814 fans on Saturday afternoon. Bulldogs captain Marcus Bontempelli answered his former teammate with some cheek of his own on Sunday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know we\u2019re still on Bailey\u2019s mind. You know, he\u2019s still thinking about us even at another team. And, you know, in the end, there\u2019s probably a few less people down in Ballarat for him to flip the bird to,\u201d Bontempelli said on Channel 7\u2019s Sunrise. \u201cSo maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s a little bit disappointed.\u201d Smith has been fined twice this season for flipping the bird to fans.\n\nDangerfield was superb on Saturday night with 29 touches, including 13 and a long goal in the final term, to will his team across the line, while the hard-running Smith finished with 34 disposals, as the Cats produced arguably their best win of the season. In the change rooms post match, Bailey and Dangerfield were praised for their performances by club great Gary Ablett jnr \u2013 a man who also set the MCG alight on many occasions. Almost: This long-range shot from Jack Crisp would have won the game for the Pies, but it sailed wide. Credit: AFL Photos The defeat was only the second of the season for the top-of-the-table Magpies. Collingwood coach Craig McRae was proud of how his men had comforted Crisp.\n\nLoading \u201cI have said this before \u2013 sometimes when you lose, you want to be winners. And I reckon, sometimes when you win, you can be a loser. When he misses that kick, just have a look at the response of our team,\u201d McRae said. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the character and culture that we have that we get around Jack. Straight away there was a group of players around him. I think we look like winners regardless of what the scoreboard said. \u201cI thought: \u2018If he kicked it, did we steal it?\u2019 But we owned a lot of the numbers throughout the night.\u201d Cats coach Chris Scott was relived to have escaped with the win.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be repeated, what was on my mind,\u201d Scott quipped when asked about his thoughts when Crisp lined up for goal. \u201cI think it was a game where you expected something like that to happen.\u201d The Cats booted the opening three goals of the night, before the Magpies began to roll, and appeared to have the contest in hand when they led by 20 points early in the third term. The Magpies dominated centre clearances and overall clearances at that point, but the Cats refused to fold. Oliver Wiltshire of the Cats is congratulated by team mates after kicking a goal. Credit: Getty Images The Magpies have been the best defensive team this season, and they strangled their opponents from late in the first term to midway through the third term. Their set-up behind the football, sometimes with two spare men, and ability to control the ball between the two arcs set the tone.\n\nNick Daicos was tagged by Irishman Oisin Mullin, who had the better of the Magpies star early, but Daicos worked his way into the contest, although there were moments of frustration. Daicos finished with 28 touches, including six clearances, and was still influential. Josh Daicos was also busy, while Scott Pendlebury (26 disposals, one goal) was also magnificent, capping his evening with a snapped goal and joyous, uncharacteristic celebration \u2013 that being a salute more akin to a teammate 20 years younger than the 37-year-old. Scott started Max Holmes at half-back, but it was when he was sent into the midfield in the third term that the Cats started to move. Dangerfield began forward, but was also sent into the midfield at a time when the Cats were hammered at stoppages. He helped ease the troubles there, the Cats winning contested ball in the third term. The veteran premiership great had some key moments, a tackle on Darcy Moore late in the third term leading to a crucial Shaun Mannagh goal.\n\nIn one of the great individual final terms, Dangerfield was everywhere \u2013 at one point his seven ground-ball gets being more than the Magpies had in total. His rousing 50-metre goal helped to drag the Cats to victory. The final quarter had it all. There was a controversial score review with 3.30 minutes remaining that found a Lachie Schultz shot for goal had been touched, as the goal umpire had said on the initial soft call. \u201cI touched it, but then I\u2019m looking at the replay and it looked like I didn\u2019t touch it,\u201d Geelong\u2019s Mark Blicavs told Fox Footy. \u201cWe were lucky that the umpire called touched going to the review so it went our way, but that could have been called inconclusive.\n\n\u201cI touched it, but it\u2019s amazing how it can not look like it on those replays.\u201d A Bobby Hill chase-down tackle on Shaun Mannagh in the centre square with two minutes remaining, which appeared to be holding the ball but was called for tripping, was another contentious moment. \u201cI thought Bobby was probably a bit stiff. I saw the replay, I saw it live,\u201d McRae said. The Cats, ultimately, reinforced why they are the best fourth-quarter team in the competition. \u201cWe were fortunate to get away with the win in the end, the way the last two or three minutes played out \u2013 not fortunate before that to get ourselves in that position,\u201d Scott said.",

    "text": "US President Donald Trump posted a spoof picture of himself dressed as the pope on his Truth Social platform after joking that he would like to be the next Catholic pontiff.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is seen in what appears to be an AI-generated colour image, with his right index finger pointed toward the sky, wearing papal regalia, including white robes, a gold crucifix pendant and the mitre hat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after Trump joked to reporters this week that he would like to be the next pope, just days before cardinals are due to start the conclave to elect the successor to Pope Francis, who died on 21 April .\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked who he would like to succeed Pope Francis, Trump said: \"I'd like to be pope, that would be my number one choice.\"\n\n\n\nTrump went on to say that he did not have a preference but said there was a cardinal in New York who was \"very good\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the archbishop of New York, Timothy Dolan, a theological conservative who is fiercely opposed to abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York State Catholic Conference, which says it represents bishops of the state in working with the government, voiced sharp criticism of the picture.\n\n\n\n\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,\" it wrote in a post on X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to comment on the image during a briefing with journalists.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi wrote on X: \"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the global right enjoys being a clown. In the meantime, the American economy risks recession and the dollar loses value.\"\n\n\n\nTrump attended the funeral service of Pope Francis last week, his first foreign trip since returning to power.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 20 per cent of Americans declare themselves Catholic, and exit polls indicated in November that they voted around 60 per cent in favour of Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis had arguably been one of the most powerful moral voices on the world stage critical of Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Trump first ran for president in 2016, Francis was unsparing on Trump's signature promise to build a border wall to seal off Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis told reporters: \"Anyone, whoever he is, who only wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinals will gather on 7 May in a conclave in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope.\n\n\n\n",

When it became apparent that even the boss was headed for a Centrelink queue, she changed tack, accusing them of dancing on Peter Dutton\u2019s political grave: \u201cYou are feeding on the entrails before the chicken is gutted!\u201d she shrieked.\n\nSpeaking of catastrophic messes, Nine\u2019s Dunk Tank looked like a thought bubble generated by a malfunctioning, AI-generated, political science graduate after a particularly heavy night on the turps. If you covered a 1990s arcade skill-tester with a roll of Bunnings contact in a fetching shade of fake wood, you\u2019d go part of the way to explaining the device that was used to \u201cdunk\u201d MPs who\u2019d lost their seats earlier in the day. So far, so hilarious, no? To their eternal credit, all the network\u2019s panellists looked mildly mortified, with the ALP\u2019s Chris Bowen jumping in to remind the chortling masses that politicians were actual people with actual feelings and that, in fact, forced unemployment wasn\u2019t especially funny anyway.\n\nAlly Langdon and Peter Overton headed up Nine\u2019s election night coverage.\n\nAt the Ten network, nobody was laughing either, although that might\u2019ve had something to do with the eyeball-dryingly dull commentary proffered by the pink-clad teal, Kylea Tink. She spent much of the night earnestly explaining why the Coalition\u2019s policies weren\u2019t resonating with voters to Liberal senator Dave Sharma. He, in turn, was giving off the air of a distracted parent pretending to listen to one of his kids, nodding at timed intervals whilst frantically doomscrolling on the phone.\n\nAnd that, friends, brings us to Sky News, where Peta Credlin\u2019s magnificent eyebrows were given the workout to end all workouts as she contemplated the Coalition\u2019s shockingly quick demise. After using Labor\u2019s Murray Watt for a casual spot of target practice (\u201cyour mouth is writing cheques that your brain can\u2019t cash\u201d, she snapped), she and her fellow panellists embarked upon an impromptu autopsy. The result, they declared, was inevitable, given that the Coalition were up against (in no particular order): history, Donald Trump and Labor\u2019s lies, vote-thieving teals and Greens, and political traitors of assorted other shades.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Dayne Zorko spent two years stifling a laugh each time he fronted the media and cameras as questions about retirement kept coming to the Brisbane Lions star. Yet here he stands: defying Father Time as a premiership champion, and showing no signs of suffering a dramatic fade any time soon. Zorko does not believe his heroics are a flash in the pan: he is adamant the evolution of sport science will make such exploits the norm. The 36-year-old became the oldest player to claim an All Australian blazer last year, doing so in his new position of halfback as he sought comprehensive medical support within and outside the club. In 2025, the performance that helped end Brisbane\u2019s 21-year title drought has continued. His 34 disposals, seven rebound 50s, three inside 50s, and three clearances in the Lions\u2019 most recent triumph of St Kilda showcased just how much he still has to offer as he heads into Sunday\u2019s QClash against the Suns. Dayne Zorko celebrates the Brisbane Lions\u2019 2024 premiership triumph. Credit: Getty Images But when asked if 40 might become the new 30, with older players inking longer-term deals, Zorko suppressed a giggle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs you get older, you probably want to spend less time on the track and just want to play, but I\u2019ve prided my whole career on training as much as I can. That\u2019s how you get better, that\u2019s how you stay in touch,\u201d said Zorko, who comes off contract this year. \u201cI think going forward, we\u2019re going to see a lot more players play up until they\u2019re 35, 36, 37, maybe even into their 40s. \u201cYou can\u2019t replace experience. One thing all the guys still playing well into their 30s in the competition have got is really good experience in big games, finals, and they know what it takes to be a professional athlete. \u201cI don\u2019t know about multi-year deals, but if the player wants to play on, I can\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d But the evolution of sport science and player welfare, and the way it is extending careers, is not limited to the AFL. In rugby union, Wallabies prop James Slipper has become the nation\u2019s most capped player, with former teammate Scott Higginbotham praising him as one of the game\u2019s most \u201cdurable\u201d athletes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the perfect word: durable,\u201d Higginbotham says. \u201cHe\u2019s achieved a lot over his whole career, it\u2019s been achievement after achievement. It\u2019s amazing that he\u2019s still playing.\u201d In the NRL, Brisbane Broncos skipper Adam Reynolds is plotting to play on in 2026, having produced one of the finest games of his career against the Bulldogs. Gold Coast Titans veteran Kieran Foran has also refused to rule out playing beyond 2025, despite turning 35 in June. Kieran Foran has refused to rule out playing beyond 2025. Credit: Getty Images Now in his 17th preseason, the stalwart of 303 NRL and 31 Test appearances revealed he had undergone 17 operations for various leg and shoulder injuries \u2013 even getting \u201ca new ankle\u201d late last year. It came after a 2024 season in which he made more tackles (433) and kick metres (6235) than at any stage in his career, while only twice previously bettering his 15 try assists. Before suffering a biceps injury in the Titans\u2019 final preseason trial against the Dolphins, which he is expected to return from in May, Foran declared he still had \u201cplenty left in the tank\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe high-performance side of things is forever evolving, but ... it comes back to putting in the hard work and making sure you\u2019re doing everything you can to keep up with this current crop of players,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still loving it as much now as I was 16 years ago, so it\u2019s great to still be pushing myself and being involved in this game.\u201d According to sports science expert Dr Jonathon Weakley, the ability to prolong careers goes back to the strides taken in strength and conditioning practices during an athlete\u2019s formative years. Loading Weakley, who alongside other professionals at Leeds Beckett University were instrumental in transforming the England Rugby Union\u2019s athlete pathways, told this masthead the growth of sports science could be best illustrate by the change of props in the 15-man code. Where players in those positions two decades ago would weigh about \u201c111 to 114 kilograms\u201d, they now push 130 kilograms, enhancing their capacity to withstand contact and handle injuries. \u201cThey\u2019re the same stature, but they\u2019ve essentially put on 15 kilograms, and that\u2019s because they\u2019ve had more time to accumulate that mass and accumulate strength,\u201d Weakley said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot many would have been able to squat 200 kilograms at the turn of the century. Now we\u2019ve got players like Fletcher Newell \u2013 who\u2019s in the squad of the All Blacks \u2013 and they\u2019re squatting close to 300 kilograms in their teenage years. \u201cAfter a while, it\u2019s not freakish, it just becomes the norm. Strength fundamentally mitigates injury, it enhances recovery, and it improves performance on the field \u2013 they are undeniable facts. \u201cIf we implement good, proper strength and conditioning from a young age, we have a greater opportunity to enhance things like strength and power.\u201d While the Australian Catholic University associate professor believes the extension of careers will be in small increments, the lengthening of a player\u2019s peak period will grow as a result of their improved conditioning. Loading \u201cWhat we have seen is players being able to play for longer because they had a greater training base, we\u2019re more aware of injuries and how to treat them, the nutritional considerations around recovery, and things like sleep,\u201d Weakley said. \u201cIt might be one to three years, but that lengthening of that window of peak performance might be why we\u2019re feeling like players\u2019 careers are lengthening.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size\n\nAnthony Albanese has two cyclones to thank for his historic trouncing of the Coalition.\n\nCyclone Alfred\u2019s arrival off the Queensland coast delayed plans for an April election and allowed Labor to use the budget to launch into the election campaign. Even more important was the hurricane-like return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nCyclone Donald made landfall in Canada last week, delivering the centre-left Liberal Party a fourth-term victory that seemed impossible at the start of this year. Then he crashed through Australia\u2019s electoral map, demolishing the Coalition\u2019s hopes of victory. The parallels between the two countries, both close American allies, are unmistakable. Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre lost not just the election but his own seat, as did Peter Dutton.\n\nLocal factors at play in this election \u2013 Dutton\u2019s woeful campaign, Albanese\u2019s astuteness, interest rates beginning to fall \u2013 were all crucial. But around the world, Albanese\u2019s victory will be interpreted as a repudiation of Trumpism and the latest sign of a revival of social democratic politics.\n\nTrump\u2019s radical and in many ways frightening return to office has breathed new life into centre-left parties.\n\nThe turnaround from the beginning of this year has been rapid and remarkable. As Trump\u2019s second inauguration approached on January 20, centre-left parties were grasping for relevance. In an era of high inflation, incumbency had become a curse and left-wing governments were in an especially grim position. Conservative populism was in the ascendancy. Canada\u2019s progressive prince, Justin Trudeau, announced his retirement in January as a beleaguered, unpopular figure. Labor was falling behind the Coalition in the polls, raising the likelihood of a Dutton prime ministership.\n\n\u201cSocial democratic parties across the world are in disarray,\u201d Emma Dawson, the head of the progressive Per Capita think tank, said in January. Public intellectual Clive Hamilton, who founded the left-wing Australia Institute, argued, \u201cthere is clearly something profound going on\u201d in global politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that social democratic parties are struggling to sustain their votes,\u201d Hamilton said.",

    "text": "This comment could be construed as a veiled swipe at his former club, the Western Bulldogs. The Bulldogs had hosted Port Adelaide in Ballarat before a miserly 4814 fans on Saturday afternoon. Bulldogs captain Marcus Bontempelli answered his former teammate with some cheek of his own on Sunday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know we\u2019re still on Bailey\u2019s mind. You know, he\u2019s still thinking about us even at another team. And, you know, in the end, there\u2019s probably a few less people down in Ballarat for him to flip the bird to,\u201d Bontempelli said on Channel 7\u2019s Sunrise. \u201cSo maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s a little bit disappointed.\u201d Smith has been fined twice this season for flipping the bird to fans.\n\nDangerfield was superb on Saturday night with 29 touches, including 13 and a long goal in the final term, to will his team across the line, while the hard-running Smith finished with 34 disposals, as the Cats produced arguably their best win of the season. In the change rooms post match, Bailey and Dangerfield were praised for their performances by club great Gary Ablett jnr \u2013 a man who also set the MCG alight on many occasions. Almost: This long-range shot from Jack Crisp would have won the game for the Pies, but it sailed wide. Credit: AFL Photos The defeat was only the second of the season for the top-of-the-table Magpies. Collingwood coach Craig McRae was proud of how his men had comforted Crisp.\n\nLoading \u201cI have said this before \u2013 sometimes when you lose, you want to be winners. And I reckon, sometimes when you win, you can be a loser. When he misses that kick, just have a look at the response of our team,\u201d McRae said. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the character and culture that we have that we get around Jack. Straight away there was a group of players around him. I think we look like winners regardless of what the scoreboard said. \u201cI thought: \u2018If he kicked it, did we steal it?\u2019 But we owned a lot of the numbers throughout the night.\u201d Cats coach Chris Scott was relived to have escaped with the win.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be repeated, what was on my mind,\u201d Scott quipped when asked about his thoughts when Crisp lined up for goal. \u201cI think it was a game where you expected something like that to happen.\u201d The Cats booted the opening three goals of the night, before the Magpies began to roll, and appeared to have the contest in hand when they led by 20 points early in the third term. The Magpies dominated centre clearances and overall clearances at that point, but the Cats refused to fold. Oliver Wiltshire of the Cats is congratulated by team mates after kicking a goal. Credit: Getty Images The Magpies have been the best defensive team this season, and they strangled their opponents from late in the first term to midway through the third term. Their set-up behind the football, sometimes with two spare men, and ability to control the ball between the two arcs set the tone.\n\nNick Daicos was tagged by Irishman Oisin Mullin, who had the better of the Magpies star early, but Daicos worked his way into the contest, although there were moments of frustration. Daicos finished with 28 touches, including six clearances, and was still influential. Josh Daicos was also busy, while Scott Pendlebury (26 disposals, one goal) was also magnificent, capping his evening with a snapped goal and joyous, uncharacteristic celebration \u2013 that being a salute more akin to a teammate 20 years younger than the 37-year-old. Scott started Max Holmes at half-back, but it was when he was sent into the midfield in the third term that the Cats started to move. Dangerfield began forward, but was also sent into the midfield at a time when the Cats were hammered at stoppages. He helped ease the troubles there, the Cats winning contested ball in the third term. The veteran premiership great had some key moments, a tackle on Darcy Moore late in the third term leading to a crucial Shaun Mannagh goal.\n\nIn one of the great individual final terms, Dangerfield was everywhere \u2013 at one point his seven ground-ball gets being more than the Magpies had in total. His rousing 50-metre goal helped to drag the Cats to victory. The final quarter had it all. There was a controversial score review with 3.30 minutes remaining that found a Lachie Schultz shot for goal had been touched, as the goal umpire had said on the initial soft call. \u201cI touched it, but then I\u2019m looking at the replay and it looked like I didn\u2019t touch it,\u201d Geelong\u2019s Mark Blicavs told Fox Footy. \u201cWe were lucky that the umpire called touched going to the review so it went our way, but that could have been called inconclusive.\n\n\u201cI touched it, but it\u2019s amazing how it can not look like it on those replays.\u201d A Bobby Hill chase-down tackle on Shaun Mannagh in the centre square with two minutes remaining, which appeared to be holding the ball but was called for tripping, was another contentious moment. \u201cI thought Bobby was probably a bit stiff. I saw the replay, I saw it live,\u201d McRae said. The Cats, ultimately, reinforced why they are the best fourth-quarter team in the competition. \u201cWe were fortunate to get away with the win in the end, the way the last two or three minutes played out \u2013 not fortunate before that to get ourselves in that position,\u201d Scott said.",

That works out to $4.47 per share, also down sharply.\n\nAnd Buffett's net worth as of Saturday was $168.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine's real-time rich list.\n\n\"I have no intention -- zero -- of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,\" Buffett told shareholders, who responded with a standing ovation.\n\n\"The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg's management than mine.\"\n\n\"So that's the news hook for the day,\" Buffett quipped.\n\nAbel, a long-time core figure of Berkshire, joined the group in the energy division in 1992 and has been on the board of directors since 2018.\n\n\"Greg Abel and the rest of the team has huge shoes to fill, and they have immense amounts of cash to put to work if they so desire,\" said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.",

BROWN/AFP/AFP)\n\nAdmired for his investing prowess and a taste for the simple things in life rather than luxury, billionaire Warren Buffett has won public affection even as he amassed a fortune for the ages -- riches that the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has pledged to give away.\n\nBuffett studiously rejected exotic financial vehicles, as well as the brass-knuckle tactics of corporate raiders, adopting instead a buy-and-hold strategy of long-term investments.\n\nHis legacy: Berkshire Hathaway, the Nebraska-based conglomerate whose diverse holdings range from Duracell batteries to insurer Geico to paint brands to diamonds.\n\nThe company also holds carefully selected equity stakes in US corporate giants such as Coca-Cola and Chevron.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, at age 94, he is ready to step away from the company he built, announcing on Saturday that he plans to step down at year's end and will recommend that his chosen successor Greg Abel take his place as Berkshire CEO.\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine's real-time rich list, as of Saturday, his net worth is $168.2 billion -- the fifth biggest fortune in the world.\n\nBuffett has nevertheless avoided the trappings of the oft-maligned \"one percent,\" eschewing big-ticket art collecting or fancy mansions around the world.\n\nHe still lives in the same house in a quiet neighborhood of Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500.\n\nHis gastronomic tastes are decidedly humble, including McDonald's Chicken McNuggets at least three times a week, potato chips for snacks, ice cream for dessert and an average of five cans of Coca-Cola per day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis hobbies include bridge and playing the ukulele.\n\n\"I don't need fancy clothes,\" Buffett told CBS in 2013. \"I don't need fancy food.\"\n\nYet he did acknowledge in 2006 that he owned a private jet, saying the splurge made his life easier.\n\n- Philanthropy -\n\nThat same year, Buffett announced that he would donate 99 percent of his fortune to philanthropic causes.\n\nJoined by his friend and bridge partner Bill Gates, Buffett subsequently persuaded other billionaires to pledge to also donate at least half their wealth away.\n\nSuch campaigns have made Buffett a beloved figure within US society, helping to draw small investors to Berkshire's annual meeting each spring in Omaha, a gathering that has been dubbed a sort of \"Woodstock for capitalists.\"\n\nThe investor has often used his platform to comment on economic policy, or to express pique on a wealth of topics, from the questionable value of bitcoin to US President Donald Trump's trade policies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBuffett has been open in the past about supporting the Democratic Party, while also frequently expressing the view that his taxes should have been higher, given his wealth.\n\n- Early business instincts -\n\nBorn on August 30, 1930 in Omaha as the second of three children, Buffett discovered an early taste for business after reading the book \"One Thousand Ways to Make $1,000\" as a young boy.\n\nBuffett's childhood was not easy. He has described going through a shoplifting phase and being forced to navigate around his abusive mother Leila, who used to berate his sister Doris as \"stupid.\"\n\nHe had planned to abandon his studies, but that idea was vetoed by his father, a businessman and politician who served in Congress.\n\nHe attended the University of Pennsylvania as an undergraduate before transferring to the University of Nebraska, where he graduated with a business degree.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe later received a Master's degree in economics from Columbia University in New York in 1951.\n\nBuffett worked on Wall Street in the 1950s, establishing the Buffett Partnership, which merged in 1965 with Berkshire Hathaway, then a textile firm.\n\nAn avid reader of the financial press and beyond, Buffett gravitated toward investments that he believed were undervalued, holding them until they paid off.\n\nHe transformed Berkshire into a far-flung conglomerate known for investments in nuts-and-bolts sectors such as energy, banking, air travel and food. Holdings also include Citigroup, Kroger, Apple and American Express.\n\n- Active in his 90s -\n\nDonning classic gray suits, glasses and colored ties, the white-haired Buffett has remained a vibrant player on the US business scene into his 90s.\n\nHe long ran Berkshire with his longtime vice chairman Charlie Munger, six years his senior.\n\nThen in 2021, as Buffett turned 90, Berkshire officially designated Abel as his successor -- a plan that appears now to be set into motion.\n\nBuffett married his first wife Susan in 1952. They had three children. Though they lived apart for decades, they remained married until her death in 2004.\n\nHe subsequently married his long-time partner Astrid Menks in 2006.\n\njum-jmb/sst/bbk",
