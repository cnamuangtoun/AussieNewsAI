    "text": "The British Royal Household released its financial statement on Monday, revealing that the annual lump sum from the government remained at \u00a386.3 million ($AU180 million).\n\nThe sum, called the Sovereign Grant, pays for the upkeep of royal palaces and the royals' official duties and is funded by British taxpayer money.\n\nIn return, the monarch hands over all profits from the Crown Estate \u2014 which includes vast swathes of central London property, the Ascot Racecourse and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 to the government, in an arrangement dating back to 1760.\n\nThe sum, called the Sovereign Grant, pays for the upkeep of royal palaces and the royals' official duties and is funded by British taxpayer money. (Getty)\n\nThe Sovereign Grant functions like an expense account for the monarch and their representatives, covering the costs of their public duties, including travel, staff, and upkeep of historic properties.\n\nNotably, it excludes funding for security, which also incurs a high cost given the royals' numerous public engagements and events.\n\nRoyal family members undertook more than \"1,900 public engagements in the UK and overseas, while more than 93,000 guests attended 828 events at Official Royal Palaces,\" the annual Sovereign Grant Report said.\n\nThe total grant of \u00a386.3 million ($180 million), which by law remains the same as the three previous financial years, is comprised of a \u00a351.8 million ($108 million), core grant and \u00a334.5 million ($72.6 million) to fund the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace.\n\nBuckingham Palace is undergoing a major modernisation project that will see upgrades to cabling and accessible bathrooms. (Getty)\n\nBuckingham Palace, a top tourist attraction in central London, is undergoing a major modernisation project that will see upgrades to electric cabling, pipework, elevators and accessible bathrooms.\n\nThe royal family will decommission the royal train \"following a thorough review into its use and value for money,\" according to the accounts report.\n\nThe monarchy has been using its own rail travel since Queen Victoria first boarded a specially built carriage from Slough, England, to London Paddington Station in 1842.\n\nThe report also said the Royal Household will increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and continue the electrification of its fleet of vehicles.\n\nLast year, the Royal Household announced it aimed to transition to an \"almost fully electric\" fleet of vehicles, without providing a target date.\n\nBritain's PA Media reported that the King's two Bentleys would be modified to run on biofuel.\n\nREAD MORE: Gunman who set blaze to ambush firefighters in US identified\n\nThe level of funding for the British royal family has long fueled criticism. (Getty)\n\nThe royal family's three main sources of income are the Sovereign Grant, the Duchy of Lancaster and Duchy of Cornwall estates and their personal property and investments.\n\nThe level of funding for the British royal family has long fueled criticism, with one anti-monarchy group calling for the Sovereign Grant to be abolished and for the British public to keep all the profits of the Crown Estate.\n\n\"The grant system is mad. Funding goes up not because of any need for extra money, but because the grant is linked to government profits from land managed by the Crown Estate,\" Graham Smith, a campaigner for the group Republic, said in a statement earlier this year.\n\n\"The palace has recycled the excuse of needing the money for refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, an excuse used to double the grant ten years ago.\"\n\n\"It's time that half a billion pounds was put to good use, that there was proper accounting for the cost of the monarchy and for that cost to be slashed to just a few million pounds,\" Smith added.",

So when should you lodge? (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nMark Chapman, Director of tax communications at H&R Block, said mid-July to mid-August is usually the best time for Australians expecting a tax refund.\n\n\"The first week of tax season is basically just wasted time, because you're not going to get your refund any quicker,\" he told 9news.com.au.\ufeff\n\nThat's because the ATO doesn't actually start paying refunds until about a week into the month, regardless of how early you lodge your tax return.\ufeff\n\nIf you're expecting a tax bill, however, it might be better to wait until closer to the October 31 deadline so you can save up extra cash to cover the bill.\ufeff\n\n\"You don't actually have to pay the tax until you lodge,\" Chapman said.\n\nRevealed: The 10 richest postcodes in Australia View Gallery\n\nChartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) tax expert Susan Franks told 9news the best time to lodge your tax return may depend on your income sources.\n\n\"If you only earn salary or wages and interest, then just waiting a few weeks and lodging in August will probably be a safe sweet spot,\" she said.\n\n\"If you earn some dividend income as well, you'd wait a little bit longer to maybe the end of September.\n\n\"And if you have investments in a unit trust, then you'd probably wait until October and lodge it before 31 October.\"\n\n\ufeffCPA Australia Tax Lead Jenny Wong also cautioned Australians against lodging too early, as it can lead to mistakes.\n\nA lot of pre-fill tax return information, including wages and interest, isn't available until mid-July.\ufeff\n\n\ufeffIndividuals can fill out these details themselves if they don't want to wait for the pre-fill information but those who do run the risk of getting it wrong.\n\n\"One of the biggest and most common mistakes taxpayers will make this tax time is rushing to lodge their returns early,\" Wong told 9news.\n\nAustralians who lodge their tax return with incorrect information have to amend it, or risk incurring interest and penalties.\n\nREAD MORE: Gunman who set blaze to ambush firefighters in US identified\n\nCommon deductions people forget to include on their tax return include memberships, subscriptions and super contributions. (Today)\n\nBut don't wait too long to lodge your tax return.\ufeff\n\nIndividuals who lodge their tax return themselves have until October 31 to get it in and those going through a tax agent must have appointed that agent by October 31.\n\n\"If you miss that deadline without lodging a tax return or appointing a tax agent, then you could be up for late lodgement fees,\" Franks warned.\n\nThe experts also cautioned Australians against rushing the process of filling out their tax return, as it can lead to silly mistakes.\n\nChapman has seen people misspell their own names, or get a single digit wrong, when entering their bank account details, causing headaches down the line.\n\n\"Those practical issues do cause real problems and can very much lead to tax returns disappearing into the ATO system, into a black hole, potentially for several weeks.\"",

    "text": "After months of speculation and multiple bids from would-be American buyers, TikTok may finally be getting a new owner.\n\nPresident Donald Trump teased over the weekend that there is a buyer for TikTok, whom he will announce in two weeks, which could secure the app's long-term future in the United States .\n\n\"We have a buyer for TikTok, by the way. I think I'll need probably China approval, and I think President Xi will probably do it,\" President Donald Trump said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo .\n\nDonald Trump says a buyer for TikTok may be finalised soon. (iStock)\n\nHe added: \"It's a group of very wealthy people.\"\n\nTikTok's parent company ByteDance is on the clock to spin off the popular short-form video app's US operations by September 17 or face a ban in the United States.\n\nTrump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the TikTok sale-or-ban law signed by then-President Joe Biden last year \u2014 which was originally set to go into effect in January \u2014 in hopes of making a deal for an American owner to acquire the app.\n\nThe app is used by about 170 million Americans to find news, entertainment, community and, in some cases, to make a living.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the Chinese government would bless the sale of TikTok by its China-based owner.\n\nIn April, a deal that would have transferred majority control of TikTok's US operations to American ownership was nearly finalised.\n\nBut it fell apart after Trump announced additional tariffs on China, forcing the White House to announce another 75-day delay to keep the app operational in the United States.\n\nTrump extended the deadline again by 90 days earlier this month.\n\n\"Discussions with China regarding the sale of TikTok have been ongoing at the highest level, and they will continue,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing on Monday.\n\n\"As you know, we have another 90-day extension, and it's just to continue to work out this deal and make sure that TikTok stays on for the American people \u2014 that's the president's main goal in this, while protecting their privacy and their security.\"\n\nByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nHere's what we know about who could buy TikTok.\n\nGroup of unnamed investors, tech companies had already been primed to buy TikTok\n\nPerhaps the most likely buyer for TikTok is a group of investors primed to acquire it in April before tariffs caused negotiations to stall.\n\nUnder that deal, a number of venture capital firms, private equity funds and tech giants were set to invest in a company that would control TikTok's US operations, with ByteDance retaining a 20 per cent stake in the spinoff company, a source familiar with the deal told CNN at the time.\n\nFor the deal to comply with the law, ByteDance can own no more than 20 per cent of the platform.\n\nThe law also states that the app's US operations cannot coordinate with ByteDance on the app's algorithm or data-sharing practices.\n\nByteDance is the Chinese tech company that developed Tiktok. (VCG/Getty)\n\nAt the time of Trump's April extension, the White House did not name the parties with whom it had been discussing a TikTok takeover deal.\n\nBut the source familiar with the discussions told CNN that new and existing US TikTok investors, ByteDance and the Trump administration had all agreed to the deal.\n\nEarlier this year, multiple news outlets, including Politico, NPR and Bloomberg reported that Oracle \u2014 TikTok's current US technology partner \u2014 was a top contender to take over the app's US operations, potentially in partnership with the app's American investors, such as private equity firm General Atlantic and investment firm Susquehanna International Group.\n\nOracle and Susquehanna did not immediately respond Monday to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nA representative for General Atlantic declined to comment.\n\nOther potential buyers\n\nThere are several other prominent bidders who have also raised their hands to acquire the platform's US operations.\n\nThey include a group led by billionaire former Los Angeles Dodgers owner and Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt and Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary, with backing from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.\n\nThat group, which calls itself The People's Bid for TikTok, has said it would aim to update the app's technology to give users and creators more control over their data and experience on the platform.\n\nThere are several prominent bidders keen to take on the platform's US operations. (Nine)\n\n\"Every day that passes without a qualified divestiture of TikTok puts Americans at greater risk of manipulation and surveillance,\" a spokesperson for Project Liberty said Monday in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"The People's Bid remains the only solution under consideration that fully satisfies the law and moves TikTok to a made-in-America tech stack.\n\n\"We look forward to working with members of the Administration, policymakers, and our many outstanding partners in The People's Bid to achieve this goal.\"\n\nAnother potential buyer group includes social media influencer Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, and Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley.\n\nA representative for the group declined to comment on the status of the group's bid on Monday.\n\nThe artificial intelligence firm Perplexity said in March that it was seeking to acquire TikTok.\n\nIn a statement at the time, the company said it was \"singularly positioned to rebuild the TikTok algorithm without creating a monopoly, combining world-class technical capabilities with Little Tech independence\".\n\nPerplexity did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",

(Getty: EyeEm Mobile GmbH)\n\n\"It became pretty apparent that I was going to have to quit my full-time job,\" she said.\n\n\"I was also in the process of applying for a master's [degree] because I wanted to become a clinical psychologist.\n\n\"I remember being like, 'OK, you have to make a choice. You just can't do both. The podcast is so much work. What are you going to do?'\"\n\nThe crisis of life transitions\n\nAs Ms Sbeg faced the difficult choice of reassessing her career trajectory, she says it triggered a \"quarter-life crisis\".\n\nWhether you're 25 or 45, the crisis feels the same: a growing urgency to figure your life out and make the most of your time.\n\n\"It's this impending realisation that \u2026 I don't have infinite time to find love, to figure out what I want to do with my life, to save money, to enjoy my experiences,\" Ms Sbeg said.\n\n\"It's realising that maybe the decisions you have made so far have kept you trapped, kept you small, made you kind of unhappy.\n\n\" It's a big door to open to acknowledge 'I'm unhappy', and then, 'I have to do something about it.' \"\n\nWhile inner turmoil is a tough feeling to sit with, Ms Sbeg points out it serves an important role.\n\nIt's a catalyst for personal growth, It brings clarity to see the path ahead, and, It's an opportunity to implement change\n\n\"You have to get to that place of extreme discomfort to realise that you have maybe outgrown a former version of yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"It's going to be painful, but that pain is so rewarding at the end.\"\n\nPodcaster and mental health advocate Jemma Sbeg gives practical insights for navigating early adulthood.

(Supplied)\n\nIn essence, decision paralysis is about avoiding negative consequences, and staying safe.\n\n\"People will hesitate when they think it will result in a loss to them, or people close to them,\" Dr Burgess said.\n\n\"Or because they're hoping to avoid any kind of judgement.\"\n\nTips to overcome decision paralysis Set a deadline: Tell yourself when it's due\n\nTell yourself when it's due Simplify: Reduce your options down to two choices\n\nReduce your options down to two choices Talk: Reach out to people you trust to get their perspective\n\nReach out to people you trust to get their perspective Be curious: Explore the underlying emotions holding up your decision\n\nExplore the underlying emotions holding up your decision Write: Create a list of pros and cons, and journal your concerns\n\nCreate a list of pros and cons, and journal your concerns Slow down: Big decisions take time to think through.

(Supplied: Max von Sabler)\n\nAccording to Mr von Sabler, decision paralysis is also common in people who have:\n\nHigh anxiety,\n\nObsessive-compulsive traits, or\n\nA tendency to be highly critical of themselves\n\nIn the case of someone freezing at the thought of resigning when offered a better job, Mr von Sabler says there's often a deeper story.\n\n\"On the surface, it's about logistics or timing. But often, what may really be in play is the fear of letting people down, being seen as disloyal, or not living up to the new role,\" he says.\n\n\"Indecision can operate as a kind of defence in some circumstances \u2014 not against the decision itself, but against what it might expose.\"\n\nLife coach and self-help author Danielle Colley has seen analysis paralysis play out at different scales.\n\n\"Sometimes it can happen in fairly inconsequential ways, such as staring at the cheese in the deli and being overwhelmed by choice,\" she said.\n\n\"However, when that choice has to do with relationships, your work or your home \u2014 areas [where] we prefer stability for our overall sense of wellbeing \u2014 it can feel impossible to make a choice.\"\n\nThe fear of regret\n\nTo this, Ms Sbeg offers a simple and empowering perspective:\n\n\"If you are doing something, there's no way that you are doing it wrong. Any kind of action is important and purposeful,\" she said.\n\nStream Jemma Sbeg on surviving your 20s \u2014 and beyond Photo shows Colourful swirling graphic with bold text that SAYS \"CONVERSATIONS\" Jemma's biggest lesson is realising that while time is finite, we do have so much of it to \"figure it out\", and chances are you'll still be working many things out in your 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s.\n\nFor those prone to overthinking, Mr von Sabler adds:\n\n\"Commit to any action. Action is the antidote for thought,\" he said.\n\nMs Sbeg says this is backed up by a 2005 study from the University of Illinois that found it's a lack of action that people regret the most, rather than the decisions they make.\n\nIt's a powerful reminder that inaction often haunts us more than mistakes.\n\n\"Do anything that calls you deeply \u2014 do anything that even calls you mildly,\" Ms Sbeg said.\n\n\"Movement will get you somewhere faster than staying still, even if it means you have to turn around and come back.\"\n\nTrust yourself\n\nIf you still feel stuck or worried about taking a leap of faith, Ms Sbeg is quick to point out that failures are important.\n\nTips for helping teens with wellbeing Photo shows Children jumping in the air silhouetted by a vibrant pink and purple sunset We asked clinical psychologist Dr Sophie Li, from Old People's Home for Teens, for practical tips to support a teen through wellbeing challenges.\n\n\"It's so valuable to learn something from your mistakes and to trust yourself that you're going to be OK,\" she said.\n\n\" Every failure, at least, ends with the notion that you made it through. \"\n\nMs Colley agrees. She also warns that indecision is a decision in itself \u2014 one that can leave you feeling powerless.\n\n\"Indecision may even lead to someone else or circumstances making the decision for you and you lose your agency,\" she said.\n\n\"Trust in your ability to make the best of every situation you land in, and your ability to make new decisions as more information becomes available to you.\"\n\nThere's no 'right' path\n\nRegardless of the stage of life you're in, there's no magic blueprint to tell you all the answers, and that's OK.\n\nReassuringly, Ms Sbeg says there are multiple paths to a happy life.\n\n\"I feel like I wasted so much time in my early 20s worrying about where I was going to be at 30 that I didn't even get to enjoy that chapter,\" she said.\n\n\"I wish I could tell 21-year-old me, 'Just calm down.

    "text": "Two doctors have given conflicting accounts about the circumstances leading up to the death of a 42-year-old Tamworth woman.\n\nAllyson Bailey was found unresponsive in a seclusion room at Banksia Mental Health Unit on July 7, 2020.\n\nHow the mother of three came to be transferred from intensive care to a nearby mental health unit is being examined at a coronial inquest that began this week.\n\nAn autopsy ruled Ms Bailey died from a combination of pneumonia and the effects of prescription drugs.\n\nHer daughter, Sarah Potter, said she was determined to ensure her mother was remembered for who she was and not how she died.\n\n\"She was the best parent and I miss every part about her,\" Ms Potter said.\n\nSarah Potter says she misses her mother every day. (ABC New England North West: James Paras)\n\nA 'difficult' patient\n\nMs Bailey allegedly abused prescription drugs and cannabis for most of her adult life following a horse-riding injury in her teens.\n\nThe inquest heard her often violent and unpredictable behaviour made it difficult for medical professionals to provide care.\n\nCounsel assisting the coroner Emma Sullivan told the court Ms Bailey presented to Tamworth Base Hospital more than 50 times in the two years leading up to her death.\n\nShe told the inquest Ms Bailey was \"screaming constantly and could not be restrained\" when she arrived at the emergency department on July 5, 2020.\n\nThe court also heard the impacts COVID-19 had on staffing during July, 2020. (ABC New England North West: Patrick Bell)\n\nTamworth Base Hospital's senior intensive care specialist, Guyon Scott, told the court Ms Bailey would have to be heavily sedated during these episodes as she posed physical harm to herself and those around her.\n\n\"Allyson was far and away the most difficult mental health patient I have seen in my career,\" he said.\n\nDr Scott disputed suggestions that he medically cleared Ms Bailey's transfer to Banskia Mental Health Unit.\n\n\"I definitely do not recall it. It wouldn't be consistent with my documentation either,\" he said.\n\nDr Scott said the plan was not to medically clear Ms Bailey for transfer to Banksia until a psychiatric evaluation was performed.\n\n\"I didn't think [Banksia Mental Health Unit] could manage her without sedatives. I didn't know if that was possible,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Ms Sullivan told the coroner multiple witnesses had stated Dr Scott told them she was clear for transfer.\n\nOne of them was intensive care specialist Andrew Clift, who was also working at the time of Ms Bailey's admission.\n\nHe told the inquest he had a \"crystal clear memory\" of Dr Scott's clearance via a telephone call.\n\n\"[Dr Scott] was clear on that, he was categorical,\" Dr Clift said.\n\nThe Banksia Mental Health Unit was opened in 1993. (ABC News: Jennifer Ingall)\n\nDr Scott told the court a phone call with Dr Clift \"possibly\" happened but said he could not recall it.\n\nThe court heard medical assessments were not able to be conducted on Ms Bailey when she was transferred to the seclusion room at Banksia at about 2:45pm on July 6.\n\nNearly 10 hours later, doctors saw Ms Bailey motionless and started CPR, but she was pronounced dead at 12:34pm.\n\n'I would choose her every time'\n\nMs Potter said it was difficult to hear about her mother's last moments.\n\n\"I would choose her every time to be my mum, in every life,\" she said.\n\n\"[Because of her addiction], we had already prepared ourselves for losing her, we just didn't know how or when.\"\n\nSarah Potter says her mother loved her family despite her addiction struggles. (Supplied: Sarah Potter)\n\nThe 23-year-old, who is now a mother herself, said her mother's death had affected more people than just her family.\n\n\"I have to really show sympathy to everyone in that room, every nurse, every doctor \u2014 I know that it wasn't easy,\" she said.\n\nThe court heard Ms Bailey had a \"robust understanding\" of her drug addiction and had taken steps to address it.\n\n\"Her driving motivation was her family and her children who she fiercely loved,\" Ms Sullivan told the court.\n\nThe coronial inquest continues.",

    "text": "It's a bitterly cold winter's day on a dairy farm in Victoria's north east, and the ground has turned to mush as the rain falls from the grey sky.\n\nJesse Wallace is guiding 500 dairy cows up the muddy path to the dairy shed for their afternoon milking.\n\nThe cows are milked twice a day on the farm at Tallangatta South. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nThe 18-year-old does it with ease, noting which cows are usual suspects for lingering at the back.\n\nHowever, six months ago this was a daunting task.\n\nMr Wallace collects the cows for their afternoon milking. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"It was in the middle of summer, and they all get in the river and you have to get knee deep to get them out,\" he said.\n\n\"And you're worried about all the gates being shut.\"\n\nMr Wallace finished high school last year in Brisbane, and is now working on a dairy farm for his gap year.\n\nHe is a participant in the AgCAREERSTART program, run by the National Farmers' Federation.\n\nMr Wallace finished high school in Queensland before moving to Victoria. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"There's not a lot of dairy opportunities in Queensland, because the weather is so hot, and I thought this would be a good area to get started in,\" Mr Wallace said.\n\n\"It's cold [in Victoria] \u2014 but I'm warming up and getting used to it.\n\n\" Even if you don't want agriculture to be your lifetime experience, it's a good way to get started in the workforce. \"\n\nTrialling a future career\n\nWaiting at the dairy ready to start attaching the cups to the udders, is Ruby Spicer, 18, who originally hails from Canberra.\n\nAlso in her gap year, she said she had no prior experience with farming and no connections in the industry.\n\nMs Spicer says the farm gap year has been a wonderful experience. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"I like working outdoors and thought it would be a good opportunity to have a gap year,\" Ms Spicer said.\n\n\"Everyone is very patient with teaching you \u2014 you don't feel stupid for not knowing things.\n\n\"It is a lot of early mornings, but you get used to it \u2014 if you start at 3am, then you're usually done by 10am.\"\n\nMs Spicer said she would like to stay working on a farm next year if there was a position for her.\n\n\"I probably wouldn't have gone into agriculture without this program,\" she said.\n\n\"This is a good experience and you get to decide if this is a job for you.\"\n\nThe herd of cows head to the dairy for milking. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nStaying in agriculture\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics says the average age of an Australian farmer is 58, which is a decade older than the rest of the general workforce.\n\nAnd attracting young people to work in the agriculture industry has been a challenge across a range of sectors.\n\nThe AgCAREERSTART program is currently in its fourth year and has placed 250 students aged 17\u201325 onto working farms to support farmers facing workforce shortages.\n\nParticipants get paid to work, and also receive a $4,500 training bursary.\n\nOver the past four years, 85 per cent of participants kept working in the agriculture industry with 43 per cent finding ongoing work on the same farm.\n\nOne of those alumni is Hannah Dunn, 19, who is into her second year working on the dairy farm with Mr Wallace and Ms Spicer.\n\nMs Dunn grew up in Bathurst, NSW, before relocating to Victoria. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"I love to work with animals and I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Animal Science,\" Ms Dunn said.\n\n\"I'd tell people to do it \u2014 it's a great way to get practical experience that employers are looking for.\n\n\"And it's a paid gap year, like, why not try it out?\"\n\nMs Dunn says she enjoys looking after the cows' nutrition. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown )\n\nFunding beyond 2026\n\nThe AgCAREERSTART program is funded by the federal government until 2026, currently allowing for one more intake.\n\nSince 2021, the program has received more than $ 5.5 million in funding.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has told the ABC that it is currently reviewing the program, and the Minister will decide on further federal funding.\n\nThe AgCAREERSTART program is only funded for one more intake. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nRichard Hamilton is the manager of the dairy farm in Tallangatta South, which employs the three young workers.\n\nHe said it would be a shame to lose a program that worked so well to solve worker shortages in the industry.\n\n\"These three can run an 800-cow day-to-day operation without assistance,\" Mr Hamilton said.\n\nMr Wallace says he has learnt a lot and become more confidence since joining the program. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\n\"If they stay in dairy is irrelevant.\n\n\"If they can take some good practices from us and go on and develop, it's got to be good for Australian agriculture as a whole.\n\n\"It's a bigger picture than us; if they give us a good couple of years on their way and go on and do incredible things then it's a tick in the box from my point of view.\"",

    "text": "The National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) are hoping their just-announced summer exhibition will live up to the success of last summer's Yayoi Kusama, which this year became the most visited art exhibition in Australian history.\n\nWestwood | Kawakubo, which opens in December, will showcase the innovative work of two of the most celebrated names in fashion: the late British designer Vivienne Westwood (1941-2022), and Japanese designer and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons founder Rei Kawakubo (born 1942).\n\nRihanna wore a Comme des Gar\u00e7ons dress from Kawakubo's Fall 2016 collection to the 2017 Met Gala. (Getty Images: Francois Durand)\n\n\"We can only try to exceed those numbers, right?\" NGV's curator of fashion and textiles, Dani Whitfield, says with a laugh.\n\n\"What you're hoping for with these exhibitions is that people that maybe don't know these designers come along and learn something and walk away feeling inspired.\"\n\nWestwood | Kawakubo features more than 140 designs by Westwood and Kawakubo, including more than 100 from the NGV's own collection, as well as works from the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and Palais Galliera in Paris. They'll be accompanied by archival material, photography, film and runway footage.\n\nThrough five themes \u2014 Punk and Provocation; Rupture; Reinvention; The Body: Freedom and Restraint; and The Power of Clothes \u2014 the exhibition charts Westwood and Kawakubo's careers: from Westwood's early work in London's punk scene, dressing the likes of the Sex Pistols and Siouxsie Sioux; to the latter work of Kawakubo, whose designs inspired the theme for the 2017 Met Gala.\n\nThe Sex Pistols \u2014 some of Westwood's most famous clients \u2014performing in the US in 1978. (Getty Images: Richard E. Aaron/Redferns)\n\n\"We look at two designers who were born in a similar historical moment in different places, but who had this incredible desire to change fashion and to work within the system, but also critique it,\" Whitfield says.\n\n\" Ultimately, we're thinking about what it means to be a woman designing for women. \"\n\nChallenging the rules of fashion\n\nBoth Westwood and Kawakubo shaped and reshaped the rules of women's fashion in the late 20th century.\n\nWith her then-partner, Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, Westwood \u2014 who was also a teacher \u2014 opened the shop Let It Rock (later renamed SEX) in London in 1971. Their collaboration shaped the style of 70s punk rock; think tartan, ripped T-shirts and safety pins.\n\n\"I was messianic about punk, seeing if one could put a spoke in the system in some way,\" Westwood said. (Pictured with McLaren in 1977.) (Getty Images: Daily Mirror/Bill Kennedy)\n\n\"When you think about Westwood's origins in punk, it's really redefining the look of fashion,\" Whitfield explains. \"Fashion can be distressed; it can be ragged; it doesn't have to be beautiful.\n\n\"It changes the way that we think about gender ideals and what conventional femininity is supposed to look like. Through that challenge, [Westwood] creates [clothing] that feels empowering for the wearer.\"\n\nKey fashion moments of Vivienne Westwood Photo shows a man and a woman dressed in fashions ffrom Seditionaries boutique Vivinne Westwood's clothes epitomised non-conformity and pushed her anti-establishment agenda. Here's a look at some of her work that changed the fashion landscape.\n\nIn the 80s, Westwood subverted expectations, drawing on 18th- and 19th-century women's fashion, including corsetry, bustles and crinolines (stiff, structured petticoats).\n\nFor example, she was inspired by Stravinsky's ballet Petrushka to create a \"mini-crini\", combining the restrictiveness of the crinoline with the so-called \"liberation\" of the miniskirt, popularised by designer Mary Quant in the 60s.\n\n\"She brings [those garments] to the outer layer and turns them into these empowering items of clothing, which were about celebrating female sexuality,\" Whitfield says.\n\nMeanwhile, Kawakubo, who founded Comme des Gar\u00e7ons in 1969, crafted clothes that were the \"complete antithesis\" of those seen on Paris runways at the time, which veered towards spectacle and the male gaze.\n\nThe name Comme des Gar\u00e7ons was inspired by a 1962 Fran\u00e7oise Hardy song, and translates from French to \"like the boys\". (Pictured a look from the label's spring-summer 2024 collection.) (Supplied: Comme des Gar\u00e7ons)\n\n\"She really came to fashion with this idea of wiping the slate clean, producing collections that were black and asymmetrical and distressed,\" Whitfield says.\n\nKawakubo herself has said that she designed her clothes for \"self-sufficient\" working women; \"women who do not need to assure their happiness by looking sexy to men, by emphasising their figures, but who attract them with their minds\".\n\n\"Her clothing was shapeless and androgynous \u2026 It was a much more conceptual way of dressing, which was about taking ownership,\" Whitfield says.\n\nWestwood | Kawakubo even features designs from Comme des Gar\u00e7ons's upcoming collection \u2014 giving the exhibition a sense of the full scope of Kawukobo's career.\n\n\"Closer to the present day, the more and more avant-garde she becomes,\" Whitfield says. \"She's somebody who just continues to really push and push.\"\n\nBy pairing the two designers, NGV is emphasising their similar concerns \u2014 about beauty, taste, the ideal body, and the function and form of clothing.\n\n\"Fashion should be empowering, fashion should be challenging, it should ask questions,\" Whitfield says.\n\n\"[Westwood and Kawakubo's clothing] comes from a place of thinking really deeply about what fashion can mean.\n\n\"It's not simply just the look of it, but how fashion is used to express an identity \u2026 I think everybody's always using fashion to speak about themselves.\"\n\nBringing fashion into the gallery\n\nWestwood | Kawakubo is the third NGV summer blockbuster in the past five years to focus on fashion, following Gabrielle Chanel: Fashion Manifesto in 2021; and Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse in 2022.\n\nBut it's not the first time a major Australian gallery has turned its focus on Westwood and Kawakubo \u2014 following NGV's own Collecting Comme in 2019, and a Westwood retrospective at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra in 2004.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker wearing a Vivienne Westwood wedding gown on the set of Sex and the City: The Movie in 2007. (Getty Images: James Devaney)\n\nWhitfield says bringing fashion into a gallery context doesn't change the meaning behind the clothes \u2014 but instead offers an opportunity to put the designs into a historical and cultural context.\n\n\"It's about drawing people's attention to the importance of those [cultural] shifts [and] of those designs,\" Whitfield says.\n\n\"[It's about] showing not just how [the clothing] looked, but how they were made and how they were constructed, and the innovations [behind them] \u2014 aesthetic or material or technical.\"\n\nDesigners like Westwood and Kawakubo belong in the gallery because, like all artists, they offer different ways of seeing the world.\n\n\"There's no one way of doing anything,\" Whitfield says.\n\n\"[Westwood and Kawakubo] played with form and function, they've turned [clothing] inside out, they've exaggerated, they've parodied, and they've questioned, and I think that's really appealing.\n\n\"It is in that kind of spirit that we should all be dressing every day, don't you think?\"\n\nWestwood | Kawakubo is at NGV International from December 7-April 19.",

    "text": "Ambulances in regional Western Australia spent more than 240 hours waiting outside hospitals to transfer patients last month \u2014 an average of eight hours a day.\n\nThe June figures from St John represent a new high for regional ramping, surpassing the previous record of 222.2 hours last September.\n\nRamping happens any time an ambulance spends more than 30 minutes waiting outside a hospital for their patient to be received.\n\nWhile every regional hospital except Northam experienced a month-on-month increase in June, Bunbury hospital bore the brunt of the problem, accounting for about 85 per cent of non-metropolitan ramping hours.\n\nMeanwhile, metropolitan hospitals collectively observed a small decrease.\n\nWA deputy opposition leader Libby Mettam says the spike in regional ramping hours is concerning. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)\n\nWA deputy opposition leader and shadow health minister Libby Mettam said the situation was putting regional West Australians' lives at risk.\n\nShe said spikes in ramping could also hamper the capacity of paramedics to respond to emergencies.\n\nHealth Minister Meredith Hammat said ramping was a nationwide issue with a range of complex contributing factors.\n\n\"Our government is throwing everything we can at it,\" she said.\n\n\"Bunbury Regional Hospital is currently undergoing a $471.5 million redevelopment to boost patient capacity, and we've significantly increased staff numbers statewide by more than 30 per cent since 2021.\n\n\"WA Country Health Service has several initiatives to attract and retain junior doctors in the regions, and I'm pleased to report a record 33 interns joined the health service this year.\"\n\nBeds not enough, AMA says\n\nThe state government began a significant redevelopment of Bunbury hospital in January to expand its capacity.\n\nBut the Australian Medical Association (AMA) said while the project would add more beds, it would not address staffing shortages, which it believed was behind the ramping increase.\n\nAMA WA president Kyle Hoath said it was a chronic and growing problem.\n\nBunbury Regional Hospital is undergoing a major redevelopment. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)\n\n\"The workforce in our regional areas is stretched really thin \u2026 particularly when we look at Bunbury,\" he said.\n\n\" We don't train enough people in the regions and we don't do enough to keep them there. \"\n\nDr Hoath said it was not just hospital staffing shortages having an impact on ramping.\n\nHe said general practitioners were under pressure in regional and rural areas too, partly due to a lack of specialist services, meaning some patients were forced to lean on emergency services instead.\n\nDr Hoath has urged the state government to invest more in attracting medical staff to the regions and incentivising them to stay.\n\nThe National Rural Health Alliance echoed that call.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we pay people well, not less, that we make sure their practices can function without feeling that they're stretched,\" chief executive Susanne Tegen said.\n\n\"It's about time people that live in rural Australia receive the same access to healthcare and the same amount of dollars [as is] spent on urban people.\"\n\nAmbulances across regional WA waited more than 240 hours to transfer patients in June. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)\n\nHousing crisis also a factor\n\nDental surgeon David McInerney is well acquainted with the difficulties of attracting staff to the region.\n\nBut the Margaret River-based practitioner said it was not always for lack of desire.\n\n\"There is simply nowhere for them to live,\" Dr McInerney said.\n\nRecently he had to put three of his dental staff up in vacant dwellings on his own property in order to keep them.\n\n\"Other health practices who don't have that additional help would be struggling to attract staff because if they don't have anywhere to live, they're not going to come,\" he said.\n\nDr Mclnerney said the area's growing population was also putting a strain on other essential infrastructure, including Margaret River Hospital itself.\n\nHe said this added pressure to Bunbury's system as locals were often forced to turn there instead.\n\nThe Australian Medical Association says staff shortages are behind recent increases in ramping. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"People are seriously ill but they're being shipped away from their families and their support networks simply because they don't have the beds available,\" he said.\n\n\" It's an absolute dire situation \u2026 the state government's really not keeping pace with the healthcare demands of rural communities. \"\n\nThe ABC has contacted the WA Country Health Service (WACHS) for comment.\n\nSt John WA declined to comment.",

    "text": "The number of students receiving Youth Allowance payments has decreased sharply in the past 20 years, leading to concerns from experts that low-income and regional students are being locked out of tertiary education.\n\nThere were roughly 275,000 students receiving Youth Allowance in June 2005, compared to just under 162,000 in May this year, according to the Department of Social Services.\n\nOver the same period, there had been an increase in the overall number of students attending university.\n\nNeeve Nagle, who is a law student at the University of Technology, Sydney and a member of the National Union of Students, told triple j Hack the declining number of recipients hit low-income and regional students the hardest because they did not have the option of relying on their parents for support.\n\n\"Universities shouldn't be places that only rich and wealthy people can attend and learn from. It should be for all students,\" she said.\n\n\"But when we lock out students that can't financially afford to live independently [due to the parental income test] the sector will begin to collapse, and these students will no longer attend.\"\n\nMs Nagle moved from a small town in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales to attend university in Sydney.\n\nShe came from a single-parent household and was able to access Youth Allowance payments in the first couple of years of her degree.\n\nShe now works and studies full-time, making her income too high to receive Youth Allowance.\n\nShe said she had not encountered many classmates with similar backgrounds and that low rates of payment and parental income tests were keeping university out of reach for low-income and regional students.\n\n\"Students are not able to afford to have full days off for uni because they're not on Youth Allowance and they need to go work their job instead, and so they're taking half days off work popping into class, running back,\" Ms Nagle said.\n\nNeeve Nagle says she has not met many other students from low-income, single-parent families in her Sydney law class. (Supplied: Damon Peters)\n\nThere are two streams for Youth Allowance \u2014 student payments and job seeker payments.\n\nBoth apply to people aged 24 and younger, and payment rates are determined by personal and parental income, unless the applicant can demonstrate independence.\n\nYouth Allowance payment rates drop once combined parental income hits $65,189.\n\nThis year's federal budget projected nearly $500 million less in expenditure on student payments over the forward estimates due to fewer people taking up Youth Allowance.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Social Services told Hack that it was not accurate to compare 2005 data with recent rates, because of a 2012 policy change that removed 16- and 17-year-olds from being eligible for the payment while at high school.\n\n\"The decrease in student payment recipients partly reflects changes to how young people study, including combining part-time study with work,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"In the last two years alone the payment rate of Youth Allowance has increased by around $100 per fortnight for most recipients, depending on student circumstances.\"\n\nThe number of recipients was trending down before the 2012 changes and continued to fall after, according to DSS figures.\n\nWhy are so few people taking up Youth Allowance?\n\nAndrew Norton, an expert in higher education policy at Monash University noted the \"structural decline\" in Youth Allowance in 2023, but said research to explain why was hard to come by.\n\n\"We don't have any fantastic research on this,\" Professor Norton told Hack.\n\nHe thinks the strong labour market could be a key factor.\n\n\"If we take it back to 2014 \u2026 just over half [of Youth Allowance recipients] were working during semester and now it's over 70 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"We've seen big increases in the rates of students working.\"\n\nYouth Allowance lets students work extra hours before their payments are reduced, compared to other forms of income support.\n\nHowever, Professor Norton said it must be \"impossibly difficult\" to do well academically if a person is forced to work and study full-time.\n\nNational Union of Students president Ashlyn Horton says students are being forced to choose between going to class and working to keep a roof over their heads. (triple j: Shalailah Medhora)\n\nNational Union of Students president Ashlyn Horton told Hack that having to work long hours while studying impacted disadvantaged students the most, and had led to a decline in campus culture.\n\n\"It is really destroying university life,\" she said.\n\n\"The tanking of the Youth Allowance rate is creating division, socio-economically.\n\n\" People are being forced to choose between going to their job or going to their classes and obviously people are going to pick their job because they need to be able to pay their rent. \"\n\nThe way the payment is designed may be to blame for falling rates, too.\n\n\"The parental income test does actually exclude a lot of people,\" Professor Norton said.\n\nMs Horton said the parental income test \"shouldn't exist in the first place\".\n\n\"Once you're 18, you're an independent adult. You should be treated as such and your parents' income should not matter.\"\n\nYouth allowance 'doesn't cover the basics'\n\nExperts are concerned that low payment rates are deterring people from going to university or are causing them to drop out before they graduate.\n\nThe rate of Youth Allowance remains much lower than other forms of income support.\n\nA young person aged 18 or older with no children who lives away from home to study can receive the full rate of just under $332 a week. That's a yearly income of $17,245.80.\n\n\"Youth Allowance is just $48 a day \u2026 To put that into perspective, that's just 35 per cent of the minimum wage,\" program director of social security at the Australian Council of Social Services (ACOSS), Charmaine Crowe, told Hack.\n\n\" ACOSS is really concerned that the low rate of the payment itself is leading to young people not studying because Youth Allowance simply isn't enough to cover the basics. \"\n\nACOSS has been calling on the government to raise the rate of payments like Youth Allowance for several years.\n\n\"We think these payments should be lifted to at least $82 a day so that students can cover the costs of essentials like food, energy, housing and focus on completing their course,\" Ms Crowe said.\n\n\"The risk is that unless the government strengthens the safety net and lifts Youth Allowance, young people on low incomes may either decide not to go to uni or \u2026 they may end up giving up their education part way through simply because they don't have enough money,\" she said.\n\nProfessor Norton said the data showed there had been \"attrition\" in student numbers over the years.\n\n\"Exactly what's causing that isn't entirely clear, but I think a lot of it is due to the cost-of-living issues, which require people to drop out,\" he said.\n\nCould we see the numbers change?\n\nProfessor Norton noted a \"modest increase\" in the number of people taking up Youth Allowance in recent months.\n\n\"It has gone up a bit, at this stage probably about 20,000 more than it was this time last year,\" he said.\n\nThat could be due to a higher number of domestic student enrolments than at any other time except for the brief COVID spike.\n\n\"The number of Australian students starting an undergraduate or a postgraduate degree this year looks set to be the highest on record,\" federal Education Minister Jason Clare announced in June.\n\nThe Universities Accord, a blueprint for the tertiary education sector in the decades ahead, said Australia must hit 80 per cent of its working age population with a tertiary education by 2050 to be globally competitive.\n\nThe document notes that to do that the government must make university more accessible to people from low socio-economic backgrounds as well as First Nations and rural and regional students, sections of society that are currently under-represented in the tertiary education sector.\n\nRaising the rate of payments like Youth Allowance has been the top priority of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee for three consecutive years.\n\nHack asked Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek if the government had plans to raise the rate of Youth Allowance in its coming term, but did not receive a response.",

(Supplied)\n\n\"We want to keep things out like plastics and anything that might allow for microplastics to break down into the FOGO,\" EPA executive director of programs and innovation Alexandra Geddes said.\n\n\" Some of those containers that you might get [from a takeaway shop] that have plastic lining in them \u2026 are billed as compostable when they're actually not. \"\n\nOther problem items include pet faeces and poo bags, paper towels, vacuum cleaner dust and lint from tumble dryers.\n\nFOGO contamination is a serious issue, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimating 45 per cent of all organic waste still ends up in landfill.\n\nMany councils collect FOGO waste to turn into compost they either buy back or sell to farmers. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nThere are 128 local councils in NSW and, according to the EPA, 57 already have a FOGO service.\n\nAnother 13 have FOGO plans in place, 32 have green bins to collect garden waste only and 26 offer no organic collection.\n\nAt this stage, it is up individual councils to implement and enforce rules about what can go in the green bin, although the EPA does provide \"guidance\".\n\n\"That's because what we really want is [pure] organic matter that comes out of the process,\" Ms Geddes said.\n\nIt is also up to the individual councils to determine how they collect and process FOGO material, with many opting to send it to composting facilities and then buy it back for their fertiliser regimes.\n\nDan Nicholson says householder education on FOGO has a way to go. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nFrom FOGO to farmers\n\nDan Nicholson, director of Topsoil Organics, is acutely aware of confusion around FOGO.\n\nThe FOGO generated by 186,000 residents in Sydney's Inner West LGA are trucked to his composting facility at Forbes, in the NSW Central West, a round trip of more than 700 kilometres.\n\n\"We try to really harvest every bit of organics possible that comes on site \u2026 it's a circular economy,\" he said.\n\n\"We're still obviously getting the wrong things going into the bin, from drink bottles and milk cartons [to] the whole packet of bread still with the plastic around it.\"\n\nPickers sort the food and garden waste by hand to eliminate as much contamination as possible. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nMr Nicholson said he employed 10 people to pick through FOGO and remove contamination.\n\nAnything that comes in a green \"compostable\" bag is separated in the picking station and eventually processed using black soldier flies to harvest residual organics.\n\nBlack soldier fly maggots harvest the organic waste from containers and other FOGO contaminating material. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"We still need a lot more education and people need to understand that FOGO is a material that's being used in the agricultural sector,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got to get that material spotless so it fits the order and exemption to be able to go back into land.\"\n\nOrganic alternative to synthetic fertiliser\n\nClint Neville, a third-generation mixed farmer from Forbes who is using organic fertiliser produced by FOGO composting, said increasing organic carbon levels in the soil boosted its water-holding capacity while adding macro-nutrients.\n\nClint Neville has been using organic fertiliser for years. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\n\"Every 30 years, your soil organic levels halve,\" Mr Neville said.\n\n\"We had one paddock where it was 0.5 per cent organic carbon [with 2 to 3 per cent being where we want to be] and we got about 600 tonnes of compost, and within 12 months we saw it bounce up to 1.7 per cent.\"\n\nMr Neville said his aim had been to build more resilience within his farming system and do more with less.",

(ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nFederal Barker MP Tony Pasin, who gathered more than 1,700 signatures on an online petition calling on Seven West Media to continue its contractual agreement with WIN TV, said anti-siphoning legislation required TV channel owners to broadcast sporting events like AFL finals, the Bathurst 1000 Supercars race and Test cricket free-to-air.\n\nThey could be in breach of their licence conditions and have their licence removed if the events were not shown on TV, Mr Pasin said, particularly blaming WIN for the impasse.\n\n\"Specifically, that legislation said streaming services, even free streaming services, don't amount to free-to-air because the Commonwealth government understands, of course, that we don't have universal internet coverage across the country,\" he said.\n\nBarker MP Tony Pasin says some constituents do not have access to the internet to use streaming services. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nA spokesperson for WIN TV said it did \"not own rights to any listed events, therefore there is no obligation to the WIN Network to broadcast them\".\n\nSeven West Media chief executive Jeff Howard said the network had not turned off its signal but was continuing to provide content to WIN TV that it was now not sharing with viewers.\n\n\"While we are disappointed WIN has made this decision, these communities are important to us and they can access Seven's news, sport and entertainment content live, free and on demand on 7plus,\" Mr Howard said.\n\n\"In the meantime, Seven is seeking the assistance of the federal government and the Australian Communications and Media Authority to help resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe removal of Channel 7 from the WIN Network will mean some regional residents will lose access to the AFL.

(ABC Riverland: Shannon Pearce)\n\nRiverland Crows Supporters Group president Peter Marks said watching AFL on free-to-air was good for members' mental health.\n\n\"They look so much forward to it every week and to be without it leaves them lonely and distressed,\" he said.\n\n\"I just think that [WIN Network and Channel 7] have to be aware that they're providing a big service to us and, if that's suddenly gone, where do we go?\"\n\nHe is calling on the AFL to step in.\n\n\"I'd like to see what their stance is on it and that they understand what the issue is and the pain people are going through,\" Mr Marks said.\n\nThe AFL has been contacted for comment.\n\nJobe Stewart lives in Mount Gambier and competes in the Super2 series, as well as co-driving in the Bathurst 1000 for Erebus Motorsport.\n\nRace driver Jobe Stewart (right) says kids need to see sport for free on TV and sport needs kids watching.

    "text": "As a tradition spanning centuries, classical music has a rich history of composers, performers and music-lovers.\n\nBut for most of us, classical music is typified by a small group of European male composers from the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Mozart, Brahms and Beethoven.\n\n\"Classical music is not immune to politics, prejudices and world forces that have affected all kinds of art forms,\" says Jessica Cottis, the Chief Conductor and Artistic Director of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAudiences want to hear music that resonates with our stories, Jessica Cottis says. (Sydney Symphony Orchestra: Timothy Jeffes)\n\nOne of Cottis's main tasks is selecting music the orchestra rehearses and performs. This includes concert staples by beloved composers as well as newly commissioned music that reflects our ever-changing stories.\n\nAnd the audience, she says, are very excited to go on the journey with her.\n\nCottis and other musicians discuss how classical music is a living, breathing art form.\n\nWhat classical music used to be\n\nAustralia's state symphony orchestras and institutions have a decades-long history of supporting Australian music. However, this support wasn't always as available for musicians from diverse and marginalised backgrounds, or who deviated from the sounds of the classical 'canon.'\n\nIn the ABC's early years, trailblazing composer Margaret Sutherland frequently criticised the broadcaster for inopportune placement of Australian music.\n\nDuring the first live televised concert by the ABC in 1957, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra had only a handful of women in its ranks.\n\nThere has been progress, albeit slow.\n\nNoongar man Aaron Wyatt became the first Indigenous person to conduct an Australian state orchestra as recently as 2022.\n\nNew series busts classical music myth Photo shows Woman in blue shirt and pants sits on a stool smiling widely. She sits against a plain, grey background. ABC Classic presenter Megan Burslem hates the idea that classical music is just for some.\n\nIn recent years, the sustained efforts of advocates in broadening music selection in Australia has accelerated, Cottis says.\n\n\"We're now much more in a place where audiences can see [beloved classics] like Mahler alongside Australian composers and no one will blink twice,\" she says.\n\nThis shift in attitude has opened up classical music's wealth of creative voices.\n\n\"Australians have a very strong acoustic identity with land and landscape through our Indigenous connection,\" Cottis says.\n\nShe relishes the challenge of presenting Australia's multiple histories and lifting up diverse sets of voices.\n\n\"As a conductor and a programmer, it's fascinating to find ways to create programs that tell stories through music, whether that was written 100 years ago, 200 years ago or in 2025,\" Cottis says.\n\nHow multicultural traditions can co-exist in music\n\nWhen cellist Abel Selaocoe visited Australia in April, he proved how classical music can co-exist with African musical traditions.\n\nSelaocoe, who grew up in South Africa's Johannesburg, incorporates throat-singing and percussion as part of his performances.\n\nDuring his Australian debut with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, Selaocoe asked orchestral members to learn each other's languages through singing and improvising with their voices.\n\n\"The different thing that binds cultures together is the idea of the voice,\" he says.\n\nDuring his visit to ABC Classic's studios, Selaocoe demonstrated how he combines the Western classical music and African influences which are equally important to his identity.\n\nLoading...\n\nMusic hasn't always simply been for pleasure for Selaocoe, who grew up in post-apartheid South Africa as a black person.\n\n\"This is our survival tactic,\" he says. \"I think living in the township [around Johannesburg], you are very aware that other children who maybe live in the suburbs or live in better conditions, have opportunities.\"\n\nSelaocoe's love for music took him to the African Cultural Organisation of South Africa, an outreach program for young South Africans in Soweto.\n\nLater, he pursued his studies to Manchester in England, where Selaocoe refined his unique musical style.\n\nSelaocoe's international collaborators include the London Symphony Orchestra and Chineke! Orchestra, an ensemble focused on diversity and inclusion in classical music.\n\nEmbracing collaborations in today's classical music world\n\nMelbourne-based guzheng virtuoso Mindy Meng Wang has been gracing Australian stages for a decade.\n\nThe instrument has a venerable musical tradition going back 2,500 years. In Meng Wang's hands, the guzheng becomes a bridge between Chinese and Western classical music traditions.\n\nMeng Wang's practice includes experimenting with expanding the guzheng's musical capabilities, such as finding different tuning systems and working with composers on new repertoire.\n\n\"The guzheng is traditionally tuned to a pentatonic scale, which makes a unique and singular sound world,\" Meng Wang explains. \"For me, working with Western music is like learning to speak a different language on the same instrument.\"\n\nMindy Meng Wang invents new techniques to play the guzheng, an instrument with 2,500 years of history. (Melbourne Symphony Orchestra: Nico Keenan)\n\nMeng Wang recently premiered the Concerto for Guzheng and Orchestra by Australian composer Jessica Wells, marking the first concerto for the instrument written outside China.\n\nThe concerto was part of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra's Metropolis Festival, designed to showcase music by Australian composers.\n\nMeng Wang describes the process of working with Wells as very collaborative, from finding children's tales which underpin the concerto to workshopping Meng Wang's role in the orchestra.\n\n\"I played the role of a demon, which then transformed into a beautiful ghost girl,\" Meng Wang says. \"In the concerto, I played two differently tuned guzheng, which represent the shifting of the story and my visual and musical transformations.\"\n\nMeng Wang's growing list of collaborators includes pianist Paul Grabowsky, composer and soprano Deborah Cheetham Fraillon, the Australian Art Orchestra, Orchestra Victoria and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.\n\nShe says her favourite aspect of collaboration is leveraging music's power to create \"a space where we can share stories without language.\"\n\n\" It takes us to magical places where you can have deep and sincere conversations with music. \"\n\nStream the Australian Chamber Orchestra's concert with cellist Abel Selaocoe on Front Row with Megan Burslem on ABC iview.\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

By accurately forecasting this risk, investors can take strategic steps to protect their investments before market shifts occur.\"\n\nThe study took more than 1.1 million Wall Street Journal articles published between January 2000 and December 2022 (what are we, chopped liver?) and analysed the language used in the reporting and linked it to fluctuations in the S & P 500 \u2014 the broad US equities index that is the world's most-watched.\n\nThe study shows that news text is a \"forward-looking, real-time lens on market conditions, delivering more accurate signals about risk than the retrospective data typically used in economic forecasting.\"\n\nThe researchers applied a machine learning algorithm to news articles, sorting the text into topics and analysing these alongside high-frequency data on the S & P 500 index.\n\nHere's Dr Case again:\n\n\"We're looking at the world's biggest equities market, and the biggest business newspaper in the US, and asking whether the news explains stock market volatility. \"We find that news coverage is strongly related to stock market volatility movements. And by analysing business news articles, we can identify both the topics and specific events influencing stock market volatility.\"\n\nIn a release, the researchers say they found incorporating their news-based measures into benchmark volatility forecasting models reduced forecast errors by over 40 per cent at the monthly horizon. They also found significant reductions in forecast errors at weekly horizons.\n\nTest out the theory\n\nOK, we're getting to the money bit.\n\nThe researchers used their news-enhanced forecasts in a simulated investment strategy. The strategy saw more invested when the market was expected to be stable and less when it was expected to be volatile. This approach, utilising the news, improved investment performance, with risk-adjusted returns higher than both a traditional buy-and-hold strategy and a strategy using standard volatility forecasts.\n\nAlso, lots of sports news (like the World Cup and Olympics) is related to a less volatile market.\n\n\"This could be interpreted as a distraction effect, where increased attention to non-economic news coincides with lower stock market volatility.\"",

    "text": "By the end of June, our reporters had filed stories holding power to account, conveying the emotion of a high-profile court case and documenting the rapid spread of a beetle wrecking havoc on trees.\n\nThis collection of photographs offer a window into the people, places and moments behind the headlines \u2014 and tell a story of the month that was.\n\nCommunity's most vulnerable\n\nWe were unable to identify the people interviewed due to legal restrictions. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nA pile of documents inks a timeline of Claire's* daughter's descent into the state care system.\n\nThe mother and daughter's story highlighted how a system which is meant to care for some of the community's most vulnerable people can be weaponised against them.\n\nIt spurred on an admission from the WA public guardian in a rare public appearance that some \"vexatious applicants\" are using the state guardianship and administration system to do harm.\n\nState control\n\nDaniel believes the Public Trustee has wronged his family. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nDaniel's* mother's assets were put under the care of the Public Trustee during a family dispute.\n\nThe trustee charged huge fees to manage her assets, but made a loss on two rental properties in Perth.\n\nThe day after Daniel's story was published, the Public Trustee said he would support the reduction of his office's fees by the state government.\n\nReproductive rights\n\nJane was forced to travel over east to undergo IVF with her own frozen eggs. (ABC News: Briana Shepherd)\n\nJane* describes herself as a \"reproductive refugee\", having to travel interstate to undergo IVF with her own eggs because WA's laws prevent her from going through the same process at home.\n\nThe procedure was successful and she was 30 weeks pregnant, due to have a girl, when she talked to the ABC in June, while the state government has announced its \"intention\" to introduce new legislation by the end of year.\n\nChanging landscapes\n\nFood truck vendors said they are only seeing a few customers. (ABC Kimberley: Dunja Karagic )\n\nAt Broome's Cable Beach, 2,100 kilometres north of Perth, a local shire redevelopment has blocked access to parts of the famous beach, frustrating locals and businesses.\n\nFaced with declining customers, some food trucks have had to relocate, leaving vendors \"broken-hearted\".\n\nPursuit of justice\n\nMs Turvey and Detective Senior Sergeant Cleal hug outside court after the sentencing. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nAlmost three years on from her son Cassius's death, Mechelle Turvey embraced the detective who led the murder investigation after the murderers were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nMechelle's courage and restraint paved the way for justice to take its course, and has helped to improve the way WA Police interact with Aboriginal victims of crime.\n\nFour-legged legend\n\nMarley the dingo brought light into many peoples' lives. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)\n\nMarley was Bunbury's much-loved alpine dingo who sadly died earlier in the month.\n\nThough few knew how he'd come to live independently at Bunbury's harbour area, most long-time residents had a story about him, and many said he helped them through dark times.\n\nOver the past 16 months, reporter Bridget McArthur went to the habour to try and photograph the beloved canine, but only got close-up pictures once.\n\nDeep connections\n\nTuesday Lockyer says she feels the presence of spirits when she visits the rock formation. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)\n\nPanna Hill, or Parlapuni as the Robe River Kuruma people call it, is a rock formation 1,400 km north of Perth outside the remote town of Pannawonica.\n\nFor local woman Tuesday Lockyer, the outcrop is a place of spiritual significance where she feels at both peace and strength.\n\nSmall beetle, big problem\n\nThe green spaces at Hyde Park are becoming more barren. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nIn a sobering development in the state's fight against the polyphagous shot-hole borer, the government has conceded it is no longer feasible to eradicate the beetle, shifting to a management approach instead.\n\nAbout 4,800 trees in Perth have been infected, and iconic trees at Perth's Hyde Park have been chopped down and mulched as a result.\n\nThis composite shows the tree canopy at an island in Hyde Park in late May, compared to a month later.\n\nRegional footy\n\nThe crowd of nearly 13,000 set an attendance record for Hands Oval. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)\n\nThe round 13 game between West Coast and North Melbourne was the first ever in-season AFL game hosted in regional WA, bringing thousands of people to the city of Bunbury, which is often bypassed by Perth locals and tourists.\n\nLocal kids watched in awe as the oval they grew up playing on transformed into an AFL arena.\n\nThe council hopes it\u2019s just the start of turning Bunbury into a sports capital.\n\nBuilding WA\n\nA shell ward, to be fitted out over the next year, at Joondalup Hospital. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nRoger Cook and Rita Saffioti's first budget since the election was pitched as being all about changing WA for the better.\n\nThere are grand plans for the future, but in the short-term they're focused on building more homes and creating more hospital beds.\n\nThat's meant they (and the journalists following them) have spent lots of time on construction sites lately.\n\nStepping back from the high-vis and stage-managed events, those construction sites can be full of different textures and lines, making for some interesting scenes to photograph.\n\nSlide-show nights\n\nThe way we share photos has changed a lot over the years. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nWhile technology has evolved, has the reason we take photographs changed too?\n\nKevin Parsons has a unique view of photography from the past to the present day.\n\nHis mother, an avid photographer in Western Australia's Midwest in the 1950s and 60s, left him a cherished collection of photo slides and 8-millimetre film reels.\n\nTraditional woodwork\n\nDenzel Coyne in Albany, May 2025.

(ABC News: James Carmody)\n\nFor the past five years, the Cook government has been helping WA households pay their power bills with electricity credits, but those payments will be put on hold.\n\nBut it's not all bad news, with the federal government promising to shave $150 off every household's yearly power bill.\n\nIt will also cost you more to keep your car on the road.\n\nMotorists will pay more to keep their cars on the road. (ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\nCar registration and drivers licence fees are expected to increase by 3 per cent, which means you'll be spending more than $1,000 per annum in on-road costs for households with one car.\n\nWhat has the government promised?\n\nIn their budget's key initiatives, the WA government said it would spend almost a billion dollars \u2014 or $963 million to be exact \u2014 on cost-of-living relief measures.\n\nIf you have a mortgage, it's good news, with cash rates tipped to stay low.\n\nNew laws, changes and payments coming into effect this financial year Photo shows A hand holds up blocks that read 01 July. Stacks of paper sit below Minimum wage, parental leave and road fines will increase in changes to laws this new financial year.\n\nBut for renters, the next 12 months could see little reprieve, with weekly rents expected to remain high.\n\nThe government has allocated funding towards infrastructure to build new homes but this will take time, and it's unlikely benefits will be felt over the next year.\n\nThe budget set aside $337 million for the state's residential battery scheme, which is expected to support around 100,000 households.\n\nThe second round of the WA student assistance payment will get $89 million, supporting primary and kindergarten students.\n\nFor kids taking public transport to school, the government has promised $10 million to extend free public transport in the 2026 school year.\n\nThe latest budget has also pledged stamp duty relief for first home buyers.\n\nWho will this help?\n\nSo, will you be better off over the next 12 months?\n\nAlan Duncan, director of the BankWest Curtin Economics centre at Curtin University, said the budget had taken some steps to help households across the state, but it would not offer immediate relief to those struggling the most.\n\nMr Duncan said the amount of pressure people were currently under had taken time to accumulate and therefore would take time to overcome.\n\nAlan Duncan says WA is still in a better position than the other states and territories. (ABC News: Claire Moodie)\n\n\"Proportionately, the rising rental costs in Western Australia are amongst the largest in the country,\" he said.\n\n\"The housing supply sector has been under special pressure in Western Australia \u2026 our property sector has been quite challenged in meeting the increased demands of the housing supply.\"\n\nMr Duncan said while wages and salaries were growing at a faster rate than prices in some respects, it was still not substantial.\n\n\"If it was half a per cent \u2026 that rate of real wage growth, it will still take you possibly three or four years to get back to the purchasing power wages had before the start of this huge trajectory of rising prices,\" he said.\n\nIs it enough?\n\nIn assessing whether there are enough measures to alleviate immediate cost-of-living pressures, Mr Duncan believes we're \"a bit short\".\n\n\"Not everybody is able to take advantage of the lower public transport fares or the free transport for school children,\" he said.\n\nThe five things you should know about the WA budget Photo shows WA Treasurer Rita Saffioti stands speaking in parliament. Roger Cook's government has handed down its second budget. Here's what you need to know.\n\n\"We are seeing some relief for energy costs, but that comes through the Commonwealth government's measures and the state government's electricity credits being paused.\"\n\nBut he said the budget has been good for the time we are in.\n\n\"In the scheme of things, we're in a far, far better position in WA than pretty much any other state in that regard, so I'm very comfortable with the strength and the sustainability of our public finances,\" he said.\n\nMr Duncan said one budget could not overcome years of accumulated pressure.\n\n\"What I'm really looking for is a continuation and a sustained commitment to improve the support measures that are put in place to help our families and our community,\" he said.",

    "text": "Nock tells stories in music, and he distils essences of emotion. Here little wisps of melody from the piano provoked response, commentary and elucidation from bassist Brett Hirst and drummer Toby Hall, the latter playing with his hands against Hirst\u2019s groove, while Nock floated lines above them that were, by turns, pensive and supremely lyrical.\n\nAcross a career spanning seven decades, primarily in New Zealand, the US and Australia, Nock has proved himself a composer, improviser and band leader of the highest calibre. This was instantly evident on the opening Not We But One.\n\nSo it\u2019s goodnight to Foundry 616, the love child of a man whose passion has been presenting jazz in Sydney for more than 40 years, Peter Rechniewski. People get Orders of Australia for doing much less. This was a hell of a penultimate gig, featuring the pianist who played the venue\u2019s first concert 13 years ago, Mike Nock.\n\nThen, as the composition\u2019s title suggests, the three instruments seemed to converge, and the interaction had a profundity like fine poetry, where each word contains a deeper truth. This was music playing the musicians, rather than the other way around, and it stayed at this peak when tenor saxophonist Karl Laskowski joined, generating a gruff sound, and playing short, stabbing phrases that drove the groove rather than riding on it. Nock then reoccupied the foreground, finding typically surprising implications in what the rhythm section was offering.\n\nThe band slipped back into a safer place with Foundry Start-Up Blues, although Laskowski grabbed the piece by the scruff and made it raw and real. Much more engrossing was the contemplative Acceptance, which had Nock making little rivulets of melody flow into the gentle, bossa nova-tinged groove, before Laskowski played a solo as languid as floating downstream in a dinghy without resort to oars.\n\nHall crafted a stonking, bucking solo on the boppish Transitions, and Hirst, Nock\u2019s longest-serving collaborator, soloed with sinewy vigour on a blues in the second set, which also featured Laskowski deploying the brawny sound and loping lines beloved of Texan tenor saxophonists.\n\nEvery composition presented different facets of Nock the composer and Nock the improviser. One moment we\u2019d hear his love of rhythmic puzzles and child-like joy in the game of making music, and the next his capacity for crystalline beauty; one moment rhythmic drive and the next flurries of abstraction.\n\nI began listening to Nock in the 1970s via records and an Australian tour when his fabled US career was peaking, and then in 1982 came the mysterious and ethereal Ondas masterpiece. When he returned to Australia permanently in 1985, he didn\u2019t always find musicians who could consistently play at his level of invention. But he persisted. Three of the worthy ones were with him on this night, as he bid adieu to the venue that has been his second home for 13 years.",

    "text": "That\u2019s why the Republicans have resorted to accounting gimmickry. Conventional congressional policy measures outcomes by what\u2019s known as \u201ccurrent law baseline,\u201d which takes into account the legislated expiry of fiscal measures. That\u2019s why the Trump tax cuts were scheduled to expire this year, to reduce the cost that would otherwise have been factored into the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year deficit and debt projections. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is \u201cking of the numbers.\u201d Credit: AP Extending policies with legislated extensions requires a new law, which is why the usual accounting convention is to treat the extension as a new cost.\n\nThe Republicans, however, have decided to use a \u201ccurrent policy baseline\u201d approach, which assesses the impact on deficits and debt against current fiscal policies. On that basis, the Trump tax cuts never expire and therefore have no impact on the cost of the One Big Beautiful Bill. That simple change in accounting transforms the cost of the One Big Beautiful Bill from a $US3.3 trillion addition to US deficits over the next decade into a $US508 billion decrease in them. The accounting trickery is deceitful, creating the pretence that the Republicans are cutting spending while actually adding trillions of dollars to future deficits and debt while creating time bombs that future administrations will have to defuse, presumably by resorting to accounting trickery of their own. An indication of how the Republicans are manipulating the accounting rules to obscure the actual impact of the Trump budget on debt and deficits is provided by their treatment of Trump\u2019s new tax breaks for tips, overtime, senior citizens, car loans and deductions for local and state taxes. The \u201ctemporary\u201d spending measures in the bill are scheduled to expire at the end of the current Trump presidency. If they were extended indefinitely, they would add about $US1 trillion to deficits over the decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nNormally, the question of whether the One Big Beautiful bill complied with the Senate rules would be referred to the non-partisan Senate parliamentarian, who has already ruled against inclusion of a number of items if the bill is to comply with the reconciliation process. Loading The Republicans, however, have avoided that scrutiny by giving the authority to decide the policy used for calculating the impact of the bill to the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Lindsey Graham, who said last week that he was \u201cthe king of the numbers.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Zeus, the budget king,\u201d he said. At the weekend he said that, as budget chairman, he had decided to use current policy as the reference point for the tax cuts.\n\n\u201cIf you use current policy, they never expire, so the policies that were created in 2017 would not end in December. They would continue. And that\u2019s a good thing for the American people, that\u2019s a good thing for the economy, because it gives you certainty,\u201d he said. Unsurprisingly, the Republican majority then voted to endorse Graham\u2019s decision. The Democrats were quick to point out that the use of current policy as the baseline sets a precedent, one they could use to implement their own agendas \u2013 and undo Republicans\u2019 \u2013 if they regained control of Congress. Effectively, they \u2013 or a future Republican majority \u2013 could create massive new programs, legislate their expiry in a few years to minimise their apparent impact on debt and deficits and then claim that their extension was costless, even though they could blow out deficits and debt over the longer term.\n\nWhile the change in accounting policy might help protect the use of the reconciliation process, it doesn\u2019t disguise the reality that the One Big Beautiful Bill will significantly increase US deficits and debt, pushing the current federal government debt level up from $US36.2 trillion to around $US40 trillion by 2034. That\u2019s caused some dissension among Republicans. In the Senate, two senators have already declared they\u2019ll vote against the bill and as many as eight have expressed some opposition to it. With the Senate version of the bill significantly more expensive that the one the House passed narrowly, even if it scrapes through the Senate there is no certainty that it will remain intact once it returns to the House, where the House Freedom Caucus of fiscal conservatives are saying that the Senate version needs major changes if it is to gain their support. Trump has set a July 4 \u2013 Independence Day \u2013 deadline for passage of the bill, which is why the Republicans have been scrambling to try to lock in enough votes to ensure it clears the Senate and why Elon Musk, who went silent after his criticisms of the bill (and some verbal attacks on Trump) triggered an aggressive and threatening response from Trump, has re-emerged. In posts on his social media platform, X, Musk described the spending levels of the bill as \u201cinsane\u201d and said the bill would increase the US debt ceiling by a record $US5 trillion. It was obvious, he said, that Americans were living in a one-party country, the \u201cporky pig party.\u201d",

Towns impacted include Armidale, Newcastle, Gosford, Sydney, Wollongong, Nowra and Batemans Bay. Locally, destructive wind gusts of 125 kilometres an hour - also possible from midday on Tuesday for exposed coastal areas between Bondi and Wollongong.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom today, Australians at high risk of developing lung cancer can undergo a screening test - free-of-charge through Medicare.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s first new national cancer screening program in nearly 20 years is being rolled out, targeting people aged between 50 and 70 who have a history of smoking.\n\n\n\n\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are in particular, being encouraged to use the screening program, as lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among First Nations Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO of the Lung Foundation Australia, Mark Brooke, says early screening aims to improve the survival rate outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia stands as leaders globally. We will be one of the first countries in the world to have a National Lung Cancer Screening Program that will look across Australia, and particularly because it's been co-designed with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will support those people who have often been forgotten.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nVictorian premier Jacinta Allan says the state's Voice to parliament won't be written into its constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premier says it will not require constitutional change, unlike the failed Federal voice proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has confirmed the First People's Assembly will be a permanent fixture and will be made up of 33 elected members who will provide advice on laws and policies that affect Indigenous communities in Victoria, from health and education to crime and development.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Allan says the voice to parliament - as well as ongoing treaty negotiations - aim to enable First Nations people to have a better say in the policies that affect them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The treaty process and outcome is grounded in that pretty simple common sense approach, that when you listen to people who are affected by policies and programs, when you involve them in the processes, you get better outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are renewed calls for a Gaza ceasefire, after another deadly 24 hours in the enclave.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal officials and medical staff say Israeli attacks have killed at least 72 Palestinians, including 21 people at a crowded seafront rest area near Gaza City.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Israel's military issued evacuation orders for those in northern Gaza, as it warned of intensifying military activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric says there needs to be a swift resolution to end the violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Secretary-General is alarmed by the new evacuation orders in northern Gaza, which have once again displaced tens of thousands of people. The Secretary-General condemns the continued loss of civilian life resulting from Israeli airstrikes and other attacks. All parties must comply fully with international law at all times. The Secretary-General welcomes the continued efforts by the mediators and reiterates his appeal to the parties to urgently reach a permanent ceasefire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a US official says President Donald Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks at the White House next Monday.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIn tennis, Carlos Alcaraz has survived Wimbledon's hottest-ever opening day, eventually triumphing against Fabio Fognini in five sets.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith air temperatures soaring to 32 degrees Celsius, the defending champion needed more than four hours to subdue veteran Fognini.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly two defending men's champions had ever lost in the first round at Wimbledon, but there were moments when Alcaraz looked in danger of joining compatriot Manuel Santana on that short list.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last set was interrupted, after a spectator became unwell in the heat and required assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcaraz charmed the crowd by offering his water bottle to the distressed fan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he was nervous before the match - and he is relieved to get through to the next round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been playing really, really tough matches the last year, the last year in this tournament. Just really proud that I always find a way. Today I did it, even though Fabio was playing a great tennis. Just really proud to overcome the problem, to overcome the tough moments, and found my way.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan Thompson is the only Australian to advance to the second round at Wimbledon, after day one of the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 31-year-old beat Czech player, Vit Kopriva in a match lasting three hours and 37 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven other Australians were eliminated: including Ajla Tomljanovic, Olivia Gadecki, Chris O\u2019Connell, and James Duckworth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexei Popyrin lost to English wildcard Arthur Fery - Fery's first win in a grand slam.\n\n\n\n",

They should have sent it out after the mistake, not today,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorsk Tipping has been heavily criticised for the error, not only from devastated players like Sveen but also from the authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lottery authority said it had launched a review to determine if gambling laws had been breached, and culture minister Lubna Jaffery described the error as \"totally unacceptable\".\n\n\n\n\n\nNorsk Tipping's chief executive, Tonje Sagstuen, resigned over the weekend, leaving acting chief executive Vegar Strand to apologise.\n\n\n\nStrand said his company's state ownership made the mistake particularly problematic, noting that the firm was \"entirely dependent on the trust of the population\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have deeply disappointed our customers and take full responsibility for rectifying the situation.

Source: Getty / Hannah Peters The video shows vision of big hits and tackles in rugby games alongside sounds of bodies colliding with force.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was posted in the lead-up to the Melbourne competition at the end of April and presented by Melbourne Storm player Nelson Asofa-Solomona, who is understood to have since distanced himself from the league.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rules of the game are simple, with a run zone of 10 metres, one player carries the ball, and the other defends; if you're running, the job is simple, you run it straight,\" he said in the video.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video explains that four rounds are played with judges deciding the winner as the person who dominated contact the most.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe league advertised the winner of the Dubai event received $200,000.\n\n\n\nWho created RUNIT?\n\nSports player agent Lou Sticca explained in a social media post that RUNIT was \"the brainchild of a dynamic team comprising four Samoan Australian brothers, a cousin, and two Italian Australians and a close mate of ours (CT), all hailing from Dandenong\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe announced his involvement with RUNIT in the same LinkedIn post about a month ago.\n\n\n\nThe concept has been inspired by a game \u2014 Run it Straight \u2014 the creators and many other Pacific Islanders have played in their backyards since childhood.\n\n\n\nWhat are the concerns?\n\nAnnitta Siliato, executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation Australia, said this competition brought a lot of the work around reducing brain injury backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just cannot believe we've got this competition, which is encouraging people to run towards each other to knock each other out,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It could cause death, and it could cause serious brain injury.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSiliato said she was aware of people having seizures after participating in activities similar to RUNIT competitions and said repeated head knocks could cause chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\n\n\nBoth competitors run towards each other in RUNIT, one with the ball and one without. Source: Getty / Hannah Peters Siliato said a lot of public education and work with different sporting codes had been done in recent years, and \"activities like this really bring us backwards\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today in the AFL and NRL, there are all these stand-down periods and concussion rules to reduce the likelihood of brain injury ,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AFL's concussion panel, last month, ordered West Coast Eagles player Jeremy McGovern to retire on medical grounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiliato said she was also worried that young people were being influenced by what they had seen of RUNIT on social media and may copy what they see online.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, Radio NZ reported that a 19-year-old from Palmerston North city on New Zealand's North Island died after being critically injured playing a tackling game based on RUNIT.\n\n\n\nBrain scans\n\nWhen asked about safety by a Dubai radio station in the lead-up to the United Arab Emirates event, Sticca, who was the head of the delegation at the event, said: \"We've developed some very, very quick procedures and we're developing these as we go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told Dubai Eye 103.8 that participants were screened before taking part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We screen every participant with full medicals, including brain scans. We certainly don't want anyone participating who has any issues with their residual health. We check the athletes after the event as well,\" Sticca said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've had concussion experts that we've engaged to help us identify ways to add value to the sports.\"\n\n\n\nCompetitors get four runs, and judges decide the winner. Source: Getty / Hannah Peters Sticca urged people not to emulate what they see RUNIT competitors do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't encourage kids to be playing this in the backyard,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't encourage men and women to be running at each other that don't have the training required to undergo this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted the RUNIT Championship League and Sport and Recreation Victoria for comment.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some time now, scientists have feared the tiny Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu [[tooh-VAH-looh]] may become uninhabitable within 80 years due to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2050, NASA scientists project daily tides will submerge half the main atoll of Funafuti, home to 60 per cent of Tuvalu's residents, where villagers cling to a strip of land as narrow as 20 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Alopi Latukefu is the director of the Global Centre for Social Justice and Advocacy Leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the impacts are already being felt right now on Tuvalu's nine atolls scattered across the Pacific between Australia and Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are seeing these communities faced with real challenges in the community from the perspective of not just inundation from the sea level rise, but also in terms of food security, water security in these communities, the impact from regular events, whether they be king tides or more serious events that are creating a very difficult situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Alopi Latukefu says it's important to understand not everyone wants to leave Tuvalu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decision to leave is a very big one and a very important one, and one which is tied to a range of other factors as well to support their families, to provide a pathway for a future, to have access to education, to have access to things that are part of the opportunity that Australia represents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some may feel they have little choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Australian government opened an inaugural ballot that allows Tuvaluans to register their interest in a visa program created under the terms of a treaty known as the Falepili Union - which takes its name from the Tuvaluan term for neighbours who live in close houses.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Stephen Howes is the Director of the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University, and says those selected for the visa will have significant rights to live, work and study in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a very generous visa. So most migrants to Australia have to endure a waiting period of several years before they're eligible for benefits. But that's not the case for migrants under this visa. I mean, they don't have access to Centrelink, so they can't come to Australia and just go straight onto unemployment benefits. But they do get access to Medicare, they get access to other benefits such as the family benefits, support to study.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interest in the visa is significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of Tuvalu's population of roughly 10,000 people, almost a third of them have begun the process of applying.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's more than 3,000 people who have put their names into the lottery ballot - though only 280 people will be selected at random per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jane McAdam is Scientia Professor of Law and Founding Director of the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at U-N-S-W Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it's the world's first bilateral mobility framework that references climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I should note that the visa itself doesn't mention the words climate change at all, but the treaty pursuant to which it was created is framed very much around the existential threat that climate change poses in our region. And it was an element that the government of Tuvalu specifically requested from Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Stephen Howes says while the visa will benefit those selected in the lottery, Australia has also gained some strategic advantages through the Falepili Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So what Australia got out of the agreements was a sort of veto power over Tuvalu's security arrangements or specifically security partnerships. So under the agreement, Tuvalu has to seek Australia's permission before entering into an agreement with the third country in relation to security, and that's clearly aimed at China.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis broader geopolitical picture is inevitably inflected by the global politics of climate change - as the Pacific pushes Australia to reduce emissions and exports of fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\n'Alopi Latukefu has welcomed the new Tuvalu visa but says Australia needs to take stronger action to address climate change too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not a climate visa, let's be very clear about this. It's under the Falepili treaty with a treaty of friendship with Tuvalu. It's often referred to as a climate visa, but it is one that is not framed in that context. And that's partly because of Australia's need to not frame things in that context because of our own interests.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the fact Australia has just signed off on a 40-year extension to the North West Shelf gas project points to a fundamental contradiction in the way the visa is being positioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How can we give a visa for something that we're causing the problem with? Okay, it's much easier to say it's a visa for friendship.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Latukefu also says it's important that Tuvaluans are supported to maintain their connection to their lands and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many this will mean moving between countries, rather than relocating to live in Australia permanently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reality is, very much as it's been the experience of many other diaspora communities from the Pacific, along with myself - I'm of Tongan descent and I go back to Tonga and we have links back to Tonga and a part of the K\u0101inga, the family with important links back to the land of my forefathers and the culture of my forefathers. And that's the same issue that Tuvaluans will have in future, that they won't leave necessarily forever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor McAdam agrees ongoing mobility will be important feature of the new visa type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that kind of parallels what we've seen in the labour mobility area where people often want to go between different countries. Obviously that's expensive. It's not going to be an easy option for people, but it does mean that they can go home, see family, see communities maintain land back at home. But it might also mean people can move here for educational opportunities for their children, take some of those skills back to Tuvalu, so it's not a fair accompli that we're going to suddenly see or over time see the whole population moving. What it does provide though is a safety net.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates and observers are also watching closely to see what support will be offered to help people transition to life in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor McAdam says a Tuvaluan cultural liaison officer has been suggested as one way to help.\n\n\n\n",

Technically not not [sic] true, he just needs to play along! Also, I'm the boss, so they will do whatever I say.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about this exchange, the officer said it was a \"joke between sisters\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same exchange, the officer gave advice to her sister: \"He won't say you're my sister \u2026 Okay, so make sure [he] sells his ability to write briefs. Pick up subjects quickly. Good team member. Loves international work. Able to work across time zones. You are not my sister. He cannot say our surname. Or where you work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer sister would later send a message of thanks to the officer: \"Thank you again for helping \u2026 I know you gain nothing from it and you are putting yourself on the line for him so it's truly appreciated xx.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NACC said in its report: \"[The officer] admitted she knew at the time that she should have disclosed the relationship to senior management.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe officer has since resigned, but NACC said it would have called for her resignation otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation was launched after the NACC received a complaint on 19 December 2023.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Nock tells stories in music, and he distils essences of emotion. Here little wisps of melody from the piano provoked response, commentary and elucidation from bassist Brett Hirst and drummer Toby Hall, the latter playing with his hands against Hirst\u2019s groove, while Nock floated lines above them that were, by turns, pensive and supremely lyrical.\n\nAcross a career spanning seven decades, primarily in New Zealand, the US and Australia, Nock has proved himself a composer, improviser and band leader of the highest calibre. This was instantly evident on the opening Not We But One.\n\nSo it\u2019s goodnight to Foundry 616, the love child of a man whose passion has been presenting jazz in Sydney for more than 40 years, Peter Rechniewski. People get Orders of Australia for doing much less. This was a hell of a penultimate gig, featuring the pianist who played the venue\u2019s first concert 13 years ago, Mike Nock.\n\nThen, as the composition\u2019s title suggests, the three instruments seemed to converge, and the interaction had a profundity like fine poetry, where each word contains a deeper truth. This was music playing the musicians, rather than the other way around, and it stayed at this peak when tenor saxophonist Karl Laskowski joined, generating a gruff sound, and playing short, stabbing phrases that drove the groove rather than riding on it. Nock then reoccupied the foreground, finding typically surprising implications in what the rhythm section was offering.\n\nThe band slipped back into a safer place with Foundry Start-Up Blues, although Laskowski grabbed the piece by the scruff and made it raw and real. Much more engrossing was the contemplative Acceptance, which had Nock making little rivulets of melody flow into the gentle, bossa nova-tinged groove, before Laskowski played a solo as languid as floating downstream in a dinghy without resort to oars.\n\nHall crafted a stonking, bucking solo on the boppish Transitions, and Hirst, Nock\u2019s longest-serving collaborator, soloed with sinewy vigour on a blues in the second set, which also featured Laskowski deploying the brawny sound and loping lines beloved of Texan tenor saxophonists.\n\nEvery composition presented different facets of Nock the composer and Nock the improviser. One moment we\u2019d hear his love of rhythmic puzzles and child-like joy in the game of making music, and the next his capacity for crystalline beauty; one moment rhythmic drive and the next flurries of abstraction.\n\nI began listening to Nock in the 1970s via records and an Australian tour when his fabled US career was peaking, and then in 1982 came the mysterious and ethereal Ondas masterpiece. When he returned to Australia permanently in 1985, he didn\u2019t always find musicians who could consistently play at his level of invention. But he persisted. Three of the worthy ones were with him on this night, as he bid adieu to the venue that has been his second home for 13 years.",

    "text": "That\u2019s why the Republicans have resorted to accounting gimmickry. Conventional congressional policy measures outcomes by what\u2019s known as \u201ccurrent law baseline,\u201d which takes into account the legislated expiry of fiscal measures. That\u2019s why the Trump tax cuts were scheduled to expire this year, to reduce the cost that would otherwise have been factored into the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year deficit and debt projections. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is \u201cking of the numbers.\u201d Credit: AP Extending policies with legislated extensions requires a new law, which is why the usual accounting convention is to treat the extension as a new cost.\n\nThe Republicans, however, have decided to use a \u201ccurrent policy baseline\u201d approach, which assesses the impact on deficits and debt against current fiscal policies. On that basis, the Trump tax cuts never expire and therefore have no impact on the cost of the One Big Beautiful Bill. That simple change in accounting transforms the cost of the One Big Beautiful Bill from a $US3.3 trillion addition to US deficits over the next decade into a $US508 billion decrease in them. The accounting trickery is deceitful, creating the pretence that the Republicans are cutting spending while actually adding trillions of dollars to future deficits and debt while creating time bombs that future administrations will have to defuse, presumably by resorting to accounting trickery of their own. An indication of how the Republicans are manipulating the accounting rules to obscure the actual impact of the Trump budget on debt and deficits is provided by their treatment of Trump\u2019s new tax breaks for tips, overtime, senior citizens, car loans and deductions for local and state taxes. The \u201ctemporary\u201d spending measures in the bill are scheduled to expire at the end of the current Trump presidency. If they were extended indefinitely, they would add about $US1 trillion to deficits over the decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nNormally, the question of whether the One Big Beautiful bill complied with the Senate rules would be referred to the non-partisan Senate parliamentarian, who has already ruled against inclusion of a number of items if the bill is to comply with the reconciliation process. Loading The Republicans, however, have avoided that scrutiny by giving the authority to decide the policy used for calculating the impact of the bill to the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Lindsey Graham, who said last week that he was \u201cthe king of the numbers.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Zeus, the budget king,\u201d he said. At the weekend he said that, as budget chairman, he had decided to use current policy as the reference point for the tax cuts.\n\n\u201cIf you use current policy, they never expire, so the policies that were created in 2017 would not end in December. They would continue. And that\u2019s a good thing for the American people, that\u2019s a good thing for the economy, because it gives you certainty,\u201d he said. Unsurprisingly, the Republican majority then voted to endorse Graham\u2019s decision. The Democrats were quick to point out that the use of current policy as the baseline sets a precedent, one they could use to implement their own agendas \u2013 and undo Republicans\u2019 \u2013 if they regained control of Congress. Effectively, they \u2013 or a future Republican majority \u2013 could create massive new programs, legislate their expiry in a few years to minimise their apparent impact on debt and deficits and then claim that their extension was costless, even though they could blow out deficits and debt over the longer term.\n\nWhile the change in accounting policy might help protect the use of the reconciliation process, it doesn\u2019t disguise the reality that the One Big Beautiful Bill will significantly increase US deficits and debt, pushing the current federal government debt level up from $US36.2 trillion to around $US40 trillion by 2034. That\u2019s caused some dissension among Republicans. In the Senate, two senators have already declared they\u2019ll vote against the bill and as many as eight have expressed some opposition to it. With the Senate version of the bill significantly more expensive that the one the House passed narrowly, even if it scrapes through the Senate there is no certainty that it will remain intact once it returns to the House, where the House Freedom Caucus of fiscal conservatives are saying that the Senate version needs major changes if it is to gain their support. Trump has set a July 4 \u2013 Independence Day \u2013 deadline for passage of the bill, which is why the Republicans have been scrambling to try to lock in enough votes to ensure it clears the Senate and why Elon Musk, who went silent after his criticisms of the bill (and some verbal attacks on Trump) triggered an aggressive and threatening response from Trump, has re-emerged. In posts on his social media platform, X, Musk described the spending levels of the bill as \u201cinsane\u201d and said the bill would increase the US debt ceiling by a record $US5 trillion. It was obvious, he said, that Americans were living in a one-party country, the \u201cporky pig party.\u201d",
