(9News)\n\nThe service is being launched in NSW, Victoria and Western Australia tomorrow.\n\nChildren were previously only allowed to travel in Ubers when accompanied by an adult.\n\nHowever, Uber for Teens has already been operating in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT since April last year, with Uber reporting no safety incidents have occurred in those states.\n\nExtra safety features implemented by Uber for its teen service include a three-way intercom feature for teen accounts, live trip tracking, and four-digit PIN verification.\n\nIn NSW, ACT, SA and TAS, teens are able to register for audio recording which will be automatically enabled for the entire teen trip.\n\nThe service will cost an extra $2 per trip, with the additional fee going towards the driver's cost of obtaining a Working With Children Check.\n\nUber for teens drivers in Queensland are not required to get the Working With Children Check as it is not legislated under state law.\n\nUber Australia & New Zealand Managing Director Emma Foley said: \"We know that modern family life is a constant balancing act, from early morning school runs to after-school activities and everything in between.\n\n\"That's why we are excited to be expanding Uber for teens to New South Wales, Victoria, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia, giving more families access to a safe and reliable way to help lighten the load.\"\n\nBut some parents and child safety advocates warn the measures are not enough to safeguard children.\n\nChild safety advocate Hetty Johnston told The Sydney Morning Herald she did not believe Uber's safeguards were enough to protect young people.\n\nWhile the driver having a Working With Children Check (WWCC) was better than nothing, the current system was \"a bit like having an ashtray on a motorbike\", Johnston said.\n\nShortcomings of the WWCC had been highlighted by the Melbourne childcare crisis, she said.\n\n\"I think you're throwing caution to the wind there, and you're just hoping that everything will be all right whenever you send your young people off into an Uber,\" she said.",

    "text": "Authorities are being urged to work with influencers and develop gender-specific social media campaigns to encourage safer behaviour around waterfalls and curb drowning rates.\n\nA Royal Life Saving review of water safety found that while men accounted for about three-quarters of drowning deaths in Cairns, most social media photos of risky behaviour at dangerous heights and unsafe areas were shared by women.\n\n\"We are seeing the rise in people trying to take that perfect social media image or selfie and getting into trouble because they're not following the safety advice,\" Royal Life Saving Queensland state manager Nikki Thornhill said.\n\nUNSW PhD candidate Sam Cornell, who is researching the effectiveness of location-based social media safety messaging at aquatic locations, said it did not mean women were behaving more dangerously around water than men.\n\nBut he said \"copycat\" behaviour was an issue, and there was merit to considering gender-specific safety campaigns.\n\nThis photo taken at Crystal Cascades was among those identified in a review of water safety in Cairns. (Supplied: Cairns Regional Council)\n\n\"The way you might communicate to young males versus young females will likely be different if you want those safety messages to be effective, so it's probably a good idea to conduct more research in that area,\" Mr Cornell said.\n\n\"I think there's something to be said with potentially collaborating with influencers to try to convey messages to people [but] even that's probably not the gold standard, quite frankly.\n\nSafety signage at Crystal Cascades may get an update after a drowning review. (ABC News: Conor Byrne)\n\n\"It would be better if we could convey these messages via the platforms themselves.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Cornell said efforts to develop more innovative water safety messaging, such as through pop-up phone notifications, had been stymied by a lack of \"buy-in from social media companies\".\n\n\"I think, if anything, we're further away from that goal than we were a few years ago,\" Mr Cornell said.\n\n\"Safety just really isn't a priority for them.\"\n\nNorthern Australia's high drowning rates\n\nWaterfalls and inland swimming holes are a way of life for residents of northern Australia, where marine stingers and crocodiles can make swimming at beaches a potentially deadly prospect.\n\nBut six of the nation's top 10 regions with the highest drowning rates over the past decade are located across far north Queensland, the Northern Territory, and northern Western Australia.\n\nThe Torres Strait and Cape York in far north Queensland tops the nation, according to the latest Royal Life Saving's national drowning report, with its residents drowning at a rate of 4.95 per 100,000 people.\n\nDarwin, Palmerston and Litchfield in the Northern Territory had the highest drowning rate of any metropolitan area.\n\nThe Cairns region has had a drowning rate more than three times the national average over the past 20 years, according to Royal Life Saving figures.\n\nThe Torres and Cape region has the highest per capita drowning rate in Australia. (ABC News: Bridget Judd)\n\nMs Thornhill said high drowning rates in northern Australia were partly due to a lack of safe places to swim.\n\n\"They [also] don't have the same access to lessons, emergency equipment, and water safety education that we do in our more metropolitan and populated areas,\" she said.\n\n\"We really do need to make sure that we are targeting and supporting those communities as best we can.\"\n\nCouncils finding a balance\n\nMr Cornell said it was important for councils to monitor social media to identify any emerging trends in unsafe behaviour.\n\nIn response to a safety review, Cairns Regional Council planned to consult locals on a proposal to extend a no-go zone and remove a staircase at the popular Crystal Cascades.\n\nIsabella Falls, at Edmonton in the city's south, could be closed altogether.\n\n\"We've had two recent deaths there, including a young high school student who had just graduated,\" Cairns councillor Brett Moller said.\n\nYoung people have died at Isabella Falls in Edmonton in recent years. (Supplied: Olly Gaspar)\n\nCr Moller said the council was \"trying to find the balance\" so people could still access Isabella Creek recreationally without putting themselves at risk.\n\n\"We don't want to lock everything up, but we need to take whatever steps we can to highlight that danger and what can befall you if you don't act responsibly,\" he said.\n\nCr Moller said the council was working with peak body Tourism Tropical North Queensland on developing \"consistent\" social media content that encouraged safe behaviour.",

    "text": "Out in the red dirt of Western Australia's Murchison region, a few small towns are united by their calls for a mobile dental service to be urgently reinstated.\n\nThe state government's Dental Health Service would normally visit the remote towns of Meekatharra, Mount Magnet, Cue, Sandstone, and Yalgoo each year.\n\nHowever, Yalgoo chief executive Ian Holland said the mobile dental service van had not visited since 2023.\n\n\"It's been almost a solid two years already, well into the third, that we haven't had any form of dental check-up for our children,\" he said.\n\nYalgoo locals have not had a visit from the Dental Health Service since 2023. (ABC News: Chris Lewis)\n\nMr Holland said Yalgoo locals were forced to make a 500-kilometre round trip to Geraldton, or 620 kilometres to Meekatharra, for preventative dental appointments.\n\n\"Unless someone's screaming and in pain \u2026 it's very, very onerous going for a 300 to 500-kilometre drive, and then potentially staying overnight, just for a check-up,\" he said.\n\nIan Holland has been advocating to get the service reinstated. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nMr Holland has written to health ministers asking why the service had stopped.\n\n\"We received a bunch of excuses that it was too hard to hire dental staff,\" he said.\n\nThe town of Cue, 195km north-east of Yalgoo, has also felt the impact of not having the mobile dental service.\n\nCue Primary School chair Richard Towell said children in the Murchison were already at a disadvantage as the water was not fluorinated.\n\n\"The kids are more susceptible to dental problems from that,\" he said.\n\nResidents face travelling hundreds of kilometres for a dentist. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nMr Towell said not only should the dental van be urgently reinstated, but considering the significant geographical barriers, it should visit more often.\n\n\"Even when it's happening, it's really only a once-a-year thing. It should probably be a quarterly visit,\" he said.\n\n\"Generally, when people are going to Geraldton, things like dentists are not high on the priority list.\n\n\"It's very hard to get appointments that match when people are travelling.\"\n\nDelays to van and staffing\n\nLast November, a health department spokesperson told the six affected local governments that a new, larger dental van was being built.\n\nThey were told it would be tested in Perth in early 2025 before being deployed to the region.\n\nA new, larger van has been built to service remote communities. (Supplied: WA Health Department)\n\nBut a recent letter to Mid West member Shane Love said the van, that was expected to be operating by now, was delayed by a manufacturing issue.\n\nThe letter also said the Dental Health Service was struggling to recruit staff.\n\nWA Health Minister Meredith Hammat said the fit-out of the new dental van was nearly finished.\n\n\"It will complement the fixed dental clinic at Meekatharra Hospital and, when it's completed and staffed, will ensure that residents in the Murchison region who can't travel have access to high quality dental care through the mobile service,\" she said.\n\nA manufacturing issue has been blamed for the van's late completion. (Supplied: WA Health Department)\n\nMr Love said local families were frustrated by the constant delays.\n\n\"They don't understand why their students, their communities, haven't been prioritised,\" he said.\n\n\"Why did the government allow the [previous van] to become so run down that it could no longer be provided and had to wait for a new van to be built?\n\n\" The government sat on its hands and did nothing. \"\n\nMr Love said the Murchison region had a large proportion of Aboriginal people, a demographic already vulnerable to dental issues.\n\nShane Love says the two-year gap of dental services is unacceptable. (ABC News: Kema Johnson)\n\nHe also said there was a lot of social disadvantage, and many people could not afford the travel costs to access the closest clinic.\n\nMr Love said the dental service needed to be urgently prioritised.\n\n\"We want the service reinstated right now, and certainly by the end of this year,\" he said.\n\n\" People need to be able to plan and to have some sureties that their children are going to be examined and treated in a way that every other kid in this state can. \"",

Some people say bad things,\" Townsend said.\n\n\"She told me I have no class and no education and to see what happens when we get outside the US.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it. I beat her in Canada outside the US, I beat her in New York [inside] the US, so let's see what else she has to say.\"\n\nTownsend next meets fifth seed Mirra Andreeva in the third round, already equalling the American world number 139's deepest run at her home slam since 2019.\n\nTop men's seeds out\n\nJack Draper has struggled with an injury to his left hitting arm. (AP: Kirsty Wigglesworth)\n\nAndreeva's counterpart on the men's side, fifth seed Jack Draper, was forced to pull out before his second-round meeting, while 2022 finalist Casper Ruud was knocked out in five sets as his troubled season continues.\n\nDraper could not take the court against Zizou Bergs due to an arm injury after reaching the second round with a win over Argentine qualifier Federico Agustin Gomez.\n\nDuring his opener, he was dealing with a left-arm issue that had kept him out of action since he lost in the second round of Wimbledon last month.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say I'll be withdrawing from the US Open,\" Draper said on social media.\n\n\"I tried my very best to be here and give myself every chance to play, but the discomfort in my arm has become too much, and I have to do what is right and look after myself. Thank you for all the support.\"\n\nDraper wore a sleeve on his left arm during the singles, but did not sport one during his brief mixed doubles tilt with Jessica Pegula.\n\nThe 23-year-old reached the semifinals of last year's US Open, where he lost to eventual champion Jannik Sinner.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruud suffered his second loss to a player ranked outside the top 100 in as many months, going down 6-4, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 to 107th-ranked Raphael Collignon in three hours and 30 minutes.\n\nCasper Ruud lost to a player outside the top 100 for the second time in as many months. (Getty Images: Matthew Stockman)\n\nIt was just the third Tour-level win for Belgium's Collignon, who is playing in his second grand slam main draw.\n\nTwelfth-seeded Ruud arrived in New York on the back of losing matches to world number 70 Arthur Rinderknech at the Cincinnati Masters, and the 109th-ranked Juan Manuel Cerundolo in Gstaad last month.\n\nIt continued a mixed year for Ruud, who lost in the second round as the sixth seed at the Australian Open, dropped his opening match at Indian Wells, and battled during the claycourt swing despite winning a maiden Masters title in Madrid.\n\nIn addition to his defeat on clay in Gstaad, the two-time French Open runner-up was knocked out in the second round at Roland Garros by world number 41 Nuno Borges, before a knee injury forced him out of Wimbledon.\n\nDjokovic recovers from early wobble, American hopes continue\n\nNovak Djokovic tidied up early errors and recovered from a set down to get past American qualifier Zachary Svajda, as Briton Emma Raducanu had a far easier time advancing into the third round for the first time since her 2021 title run.\n\nDjokovic made 14 unforced errors in the first set compared to just 11 across the rest of the match as he eventually hit his stride on Arthur Ashe Stadium, beating Svajda 6-7(5/7), 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.\n\nSvajda put up a surprise early fight to the delight of the home fans but was let down by an apparent leg injury midway through the match, and 24-time grand slam winner Djokovic advanced to a third-round clash with Briton Cameron Norrie.\n\nNorrie's compatriot, Raducanu, needed only an hour to cruise past the Indonesian qualifier, Janice Tjen, 6-2, 6-1 in the first match of the day at Louis Armstrong Stadium, as she finds a way back to winning ways at the hardcourt tournament.\n\nRaducanu had not won a US Open match since lifting the trophy in her remarkable run four years ago, but appears in solid form this year as she made just eight unforced errors.\n\n\"I'm particularly happy, because on the court, I felt like my opponent was playing really good tennis. I thought that she was very dangerous,\" she told reporters.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"So I'm very pleased with how I kept dictating the points, I kept dictating the play.\"\n\nAfter Svajda's loss, American fourth seed Pegula got the home crowd at Ashe back up with a routine 6-1, 6-3 win over Anna Blinkova and will next play three-time finalist Victoria Azarenka.\n\nAmerican fourth seed Taylor Fritz got past South African Lloyd Harris 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-2, 6-4 in the second match of the day at Armstrong, with Swiss qualifier Jerome Kym waiting for him in the third round.\n\n2024 runner-up Fritz is among the top contenders hoping to break a 22-year American men's drought at the tournament, along with Frances Tiafoe, who beat qualifier Martin Damm 6-4, 7-5, 6-7(8/10), 7-5.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nMs Butler had checked in on Tuesday with the help of staff at Albany airport for her flight to Perth that, fortunately, was delayed.\n\n\"Between checking in and the flight leaving, I received a phone call from Royal Perth saying my surgery was cancelled,\" she said.\n\nMs Butler called her husband, Andy Wood, who had left home 450 kilometres south-east of Perth before dawn to reach the airport with her wheelchair in time for the flight to arrive.\n\nHe had taken time off work, and the pair had planned their lives around the surgery.\n\nAndy Wood has cared for Debby Butler while she waits for her surgery. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nThe first operation was booked for July but was postponed amid dozens of elective surgery cancellations across WA.\n\n\"No reason was given for the cancellation on Tuesday,\" Ms Butler said.\n\n\"I've heard about surgeries being cancelled because of people with flu [taking up beds].\"\n\nHealth deteriorates\n\nThe past year has been tough for Ms Butler, who has gone from easily walking five to 10 kilometres to relying on a wheelchair and walking frame.\n\n\"I've been waiting for a double hip replacement for about six months, and I suffer from arthritis,\" she said.\n\n\"It takes away from my quality of life.\n\nDebby Butler's surgery has been cancelled twice. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\n\" I've gone from being able to walk to being in a wheelchair or walker. I can no longer walk \u2026 now I'm struggling to even have a shower. \"\n\nMs Butler had to avoid catching the flu or COVID after her surgery in July was postponed because that would further push back the procedure.\n\nIt has been a similar story for others on Western Australia's elective surgery waitlist with 80 operations cancelled earlier this month due to what the government said was a surge in demand.\n\nMs Butler said it was not only frustrating for her but people who had helped the couple prepare for the surgery.\n\n\"You get to the stage of not believing you're going to have surgery,\" she said.\n\n\"They need to increase the number of beds in hospitals.\"\n\nAndy Wood says the government should spend more on the state's health system. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nEarlier this month, WA Premier Roger Cook announced a $50 million Health Infrastructure Maintenance Fund amid mounting pressure on hospitals.\n\nMr Wood said that was too little, too late.\n\nHe said he was irate after his wife called to tell him the surgery was cancelled.\n\n\"We'd booked accommodation for two nights. I had to turn around and drive back home, $250 worth of diesel to drive back on a rainy day,\" he said.\n\nRoger Cook has faced criticism over the government's handling of health funding. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nMr Wood said that while the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme would cover some costs, it did not cover the stress or time lost for the couple and the friends who had helped them.\n\n\"It can't go on like this,\" he said.\n\nPressure easing\n\nA spokesperson for WA's Department of Health said fewer elective surgeries needed to be rescheduled due to reduced emergency department (ED) demand.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor ED demand and small numbers of non-urgent, category 2 and 3 elective surgeries may need to be rescheduled,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"We understand waiting for surgeries to be rescheduled can be stressful, and thank the community for their patience.\"\n\nLoading...",

The Cook Islands international has made 70 first-grade appearances since making his NRL debut in 2021, but a wrist injury suffered in July has prevented him from adding to the tally. Davvy Moale is poised to leave South Sydney. Credit: Getty Images Ironically, Moale could be on the move at a time when the Rabbitohs are already short on middle forwards. The decision to let him go could result in the \u201cPride of the League\u201d freeing up the salary cap funds required to make an offer to enigmatic Titan David Fifita, although his availability may change now that Josh Hannay has been appointed as head coach. Souths are also trying to move unwanted halfback Lewis Dodd from the final two years of his deal. The club is prepared to tip in $500,000 in a bid to make him attractive to suitors, although there hasn\u2019t been any interest at this stage. Former Sports Integrity boss appointed as general manager of Perth Bears\n\nMichael Chammas Former Sports Integrity boss David Sharpe has been appointed as the inaugural general manager of football for the Perth Bears. Sharpe will work alongside head coach Mal Meninga and chief executive Anthony De Ceglie as the club prepares to enter the NRL as the 18th team in 2027.

Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Sharpe has been a prominent figure in Australian sport for a long time, having formerly served as the CEO of Sport Integrity Australia (SIA) and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA).\n\nHe most recently helped spearhead a SIA review that found gymnasts were abused at the WA Institute of Sport. Sharpe said he was excited to begin his career in rugby league. \u201cI\u2019m honoured to be part of what Anthony and Mal are building because the Perth Bears will put fans and community at the heart of every decision - and that means integrity is a priority,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game of rugby league has given me and my family so much and now it\u2019s time to give back.\u201d Head coach Mal Meninga said it was a crucial appointment for the new club.\n\n\u201cI am excited to work alongside David and continue our long association within the sporting sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI know David is looking forward to this challenge, but I also know his values, integrity and experience will help us establish a best-in-class organisation.\u201d Raiders star ruled out for finals after suffering fractured shoulder The Raiders have been dealt a blow ahead of their finals campaign, with winger Xavier Savage ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season. Scans have revealed Savage fractured his shoulder during the Raiders 20-16 victory against the Panthers on Friday which has been dubbed the \u2018Miracle in Mudgee\u2019 after Canberra scored an unbelievable 95th minute try to win in golden point.\n\nXavier Savage picks up an injury in the first half. Credit: Getty Images Savage will meet with a surgeon this week to find out the extent of the injury and assess whether he will need surgery; however, Canberra confirmed he was no chance of playing finals football. The 23-year-old speedster suffered the injury mid-way through the first half after being tackled by Luke Garner, Blaize Talagi and Isaiah Papali\u2019i while bringing the ball back from a kick return. Savage played the final 16 minutes of the first half following the collision, but failed to return after half-time. The 23-year-old absence for the rest of the season is a massive blow for the club, who have all but wrapped up the 2025 minor premiership. He has scored 12 tries for the Raiders this season.\n\nThe Raiders face the Wests Tigers in Canberra this weekend, before closing out their season against the Dolphins in Redcliffe next week. \u2018I\u2019d love to prove people wrong\u2019: Could Josh Addo-Carr make a shock Roos return? Christian Nicolussi Josh Addo-Carr had three goals at the start of the year: lose weight, return to the NSW Origin team and reclaim his Kangaroos jersey. He has dropped from 97kg to 90kg, missed out on playing for the Blues, but is now making a late-season push to get back on Kevin Walters\u2019 Roos radar.\n\nThe 30-year-old is an outsider to be on the Kangaroo tour in October and November, but his past achievements in the green and gold (he has scored 13 tries for Australia), his on-field chemistry with potential left centre Latrell Mitchell and experience with likely five-eighth Cameron Munster mean he should be in the conversation. As he celebrates 200 NRL games on Friday when the Eels try to continue their nuisance value against the finals-bound New Zealand Warriors, Addo-Carr hopes he has not become the forgotten man for the Kangaroos. Eels teammate Mitchell Moses is also keen to be on the Ashes tour in a squad that will likely include Nathan Cleary, Munster and Tom Dearden. \u201cI sat down at the start of the year and wrote down some goals, which was losing weight \u2013 I\u2019ve done that \u2013 another one was to make Origin, and the third one was to make the Kangaroos squad,\u201d Addo-Carr said.\n\nJosh Addo-Carr has been back to his brilliant best at times in 2025. Credit: Getty Images \u201cYou want to represent your family, and when you play for the Kangaroos, it\u2019s the pinnacle. It means you\u2019re one of the best players in the world in your position, and you\u2019re playing with the best in the world. It\u2019s such a great honour. \u201cI played in England in the World Cup [in 2021], and I haven\u2019t played since. I\u2019d love to be a part of it, as long as I can bring value to the team, on and off the field. It is a long trip over there, so if Kevvie needs me, I\u2019ll put my hand up. \u201cI\u2019ve got that chemistry with Munster \u2013 he\u2019s probably the best player I\u2019ve ever played with. Looking back at the combination we had on that left edge when I was back at the Storm, it\u2019s something I still think about, and he\u2019s a close friend of mine as well. To have an opportunity to play with \u2018Trell\u2019 [Mitchell] as well, it would be mad. \u201cI\u2019d love to prove people wrong. That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d\n\nBrian To\u2019o and Zac Lomax were the starting wingers for NSW during the State of Origin series, but To\u2019o will play for Samoa. Queensland winger Valentine Holmes is out injured, while Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow and Xavier Coates \u2013 arguably the best finisher in the game \u2013 remain a chance of playing for Samoa and Papua New Guinea respectively. Canterbury\u2019s Jacob Kiraz, Roosters flyer Mark Nawaqanitawase and even Manly\u2019s Tom Trbojevic would all be in the mix for a place on the wing. Addo-Carr was thrown a lifeline by Parramatta after parting ways with Canterbury last year. The Bulldogs ripped up the final year of his $500,000-a-season contract after he returned a positive result to cocaine at a roadside police drugs test in September. Moses is also keen to book a ticket to England. The Eels skipper was at his attacking best in the shock win over the Roosters on the weekend.\n\n\u201cI played last year; it\u2019s the highest honour you can get \u2013 we took out the Pacific Champs \u2013 and to play with the best in the game, and rub shoulders with them, and take little things out of their game, it only helps my game,\u201d Moses said. \u201cAny time you get into those camps, it\u2019s the best ever. To pull on the Australian jersey, there\u2019s no better feeling.\u201d Dark horses: Broncos blitz Knights to mount top-four push Brisbane coach Michael Maguire has refused to be drawn into the growing influence of Reece Walsh following the fullback\u2019s starring role in the Broncos\u2019 46-12 win over Newcastle. A six-try second half performance led by Walsh confirmed Brisbane\u2019s place in the NRL finals, as they distanced themselves from the logjam of teams in the middle of the competition ladder with Sunday\u2019s victory at McDonald Jones Stadium.\n\nWalsh overcame several early errors to help Brisbane kick away late, finishing the game with two try assists, 12 tackle breaks and a silky 70-metre solo try to confirm the result. With Brisbane well and truly in the fight for a potential top-four berth heading into the final fortnight of the regular season, Maguire restricted his praise to the team as a whole. \u201cReece makes up a part of the team that builds up the success that we have, and I\u2019d rather talk about how the team is performing,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on building who we are. I\u2019ve seen a shift in how the players have gone about what they\u2019re doing and it\u2019s a credit to them for stepping up to a level that I believe we need to get to. It was a bit clunky at times, but it was pleasing to get through the end of the game with the opportunities they did.\u201d Reece Walsh makes a break for the Broncos. Credit: Getty Images\n\nWith the game in the balance at 20-12 into the final 20 minutes, a likely try to Newcastle five-eighth Jake Arthur was butchered and proved the impetus for a flood of Broncos points. Payne Haas had the ball rolling soon after, before Walsh\u2019s long-range effort put the game beyond doubt. On a day that their opposition typically fear playing in, Newcastle\u2019s Old Boys\u2019 Day proved to be forgettable for the Knights with tries to Gehamat Shibasaki, Jordan Riki and a second for Deine Mariner coming in the final 10 minutes. Newcastle\u2019s seventh straight loss \u2013 and their 10th defeat in their last 11 home games \u2013 has ensured they remain in the battle to avoid the dreaded wooden spoon. \u201cThe last couple of weeks has tested us, clearly. But they have pride in the jersey,\u201d Newcastle coach Adam O\u2019Brien said. \u201cNobody feels the losses more than the playing group. Losing weighs heavily on them. They love playing for their club and their teammates, and they\u2019ll want to go out and perform.\n\n\u201cSome people won\u2019t see it that way given the scoreline \u2026 but these times won\u2019t last so long as we maintain that desire to perform.\u201d In his 350th NRL game \u2013 where he joined Canterbury legend Terry Lamb and long-time Queensland Origin teammate Daly Cherry-Evans as the fourth-most capped player in Australian rugby league history \u2013 veteran playmaker Ben Hunt orchestrated an early flurry for Brisbane. Loading Three minutes was all it took for them to score, with Hunt providing a timely offload for his centre Kotoni Staggs to crash over. The visitors doubled down five minutes later when Josiah Karapani iced a long range shift out wide that started from the hands of the milestone man yet again.",

These are enduring fascinations for choreographers but what makes this evening interesting is the contrast: one work meditates on sameness, while the other insists on difference. Scenarios is playful but also intimate. Credit: Takeshi Kondo Scenarios, created and performed by Benjamin Hurley and Scott Elstermann, plays like a queer duet of self-fascination. Each performs as if the other were a mirror, a copy with no original, doubling gestures until resemblance tips into a kind of dreamy hallucination.\n\nTheir shared identity is really a shared sensibility. A kind of rococo dandyism in duplicate. Movements are upright, measured and immaculately shaped. It\u2019s disciplined dancing, with obsessively worked symmetries, synchronicities and long phrases that develop with tricky vocalisations. They cycle through many images or scenarios. A well-chosen text hints at the thrill of seeing yourself as another, while a darker vignette evokes the doppelg\u00e4nger bent on self-annihilation. Yet the mood remains playful \u2013 even a little screwy \u2013 throughout these transformations. Copy of the Copy is interested in the way dance passes from body to body, teacher to pupil. Credit: Tiffany Garvie It\u2019s cute but also intimate. In the end, the audience itself becomes a reflective medium, placed before the twins like one of the mirrors that organise the space, as if their doubled identities require us to be the final surface in which their resemblance is registered. Priya Srinivasan, by contrast, in Copy of the Copy, is less concerned with uncanny reflections than with the way dance passes from body to body, teacher to pupil. In that transfer, copies are never exact: something is lost and something else is gained.\n\nHer work is resolutely theatrical, combining dance, video, audience interaction and even a little cooking. The registers are also multiple \u2013 comic, earnest, scholarly, confessional \u2013 and they continually shift. The effect is of a layered inquiry, staging transmission itself as a complex, unstable process. Loading Central to the performance is Srinivasan\u2019s own dance lineage: her teachers and the teachers who taught them. As the work culminates, however, we get a more expansive mapping of connections, a deliberately overwhelming series of names stretching from the present to the late eighteenth century, crisscrossing continents, empires and colonies. As the names pile up, distinctions blur: which connections were fleeting encounters and which were nurtured over many years? Yes, we get a sense of the density of intercultural traffic, but the concept of the copy becomes a little vague and underdefined. Finally, while there\u2019s plenty to think about in this production, its success as spectacle rests squarely with the musicians \u2013 Hari Sivanesan, Pirashanna Thevarajah, and Ranjitha Suresh \u2013 whose live presence alongside Srinivasan gives the work its special vitality.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann",

    "text": "Monthly inflation figures rose more than many economists had predicted, leading to mixed predictions over whether the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will continue cutting the official cash rate at its next meeting, or keep it on hold at 3.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe monthly consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8 per cent in the 12 months to July, up from 1.9 per cent in the year to June, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt marks the highest annual inflation rate since July 2024, following several months of easing inflation, the ABS said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Reuters poll of economists had predicted annualised inflation would only rise to 2.3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ABS attributed much of the jump to surging electricity prices, which rose 13.1 per cent in the 12 months to July, compared to a 6.3 per cent fall in the 12 months to June.\n\n\n\nInflation posted a resurgence in July, with consumer prices rising 2.8 per cent annually, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Source: SBS News \"The large annual rise in electricity costs was due to households using up the state government and Commonwealth energy bill relief fund rebates in some capital cities, as well as price increases following annual electricity price reviews in July,\" the ABS said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn monthly terms, electricity prices rose 13 per cent in July, which the ABS said was down to the timing of when the extended relief fund rebates were applied in some capital cities, as well as price reviews that increased electricity prices across all capital cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nNAB senior markets economist Taylor Nugent said the inflation release would tell the RBA little about the underlying pulse of inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The surprise was strength in travel and timing of electricity subsidy payments and so [it] is not as material as it looks at face value,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What the RBA's interest rate decision means for your mortgage\n\nEven so, it raises the risk that the all-important trimmed mean \u2014 a measure of underlying inflation that removes the biggest price swings \u2014 for the September quarter comes in above the central bank's forecast, he said.\n\n\n\nWhat do inflation figures mean for borrowers?\n\nBetaShares chief economist David Bassanese said the figures were \"an absolute shocker\" and likely to \"remove any chance\" of an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The biggest disappointment is the fact that annual trimmed inflation has rebounded from an encouragingly low 2.1 per cent in June to an ugly 2.7 per cent in July,\" Bassanese wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also cast doubt on whether the RBA would even cut rates in November, saying it's not a \"done deal\", because a decline in underlying inflation may not be \"as great as we've been led to believe\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIG Market analyst Tony Sycamore told SBS News the inflation figures \"came in much hotter than expected\", but they are unlikely to change the RBA's long-term forecasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were looking for core CPI to be at 2.6 per cent for December 2025 and here we are now 2.7 per cent with about five months left to go for the year,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSycamore said borrowers should be looking at the market's prediction for interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Before the inflation figures came out, the market was pricing at about a 40 to 43 per cent chance of a rate cut in September. Most of the economists out there would have been very surprised if the RBA were to cut rates in September, because we know they are cautious rate cutters,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it's not surprising that the market is predicting the RBA will keep the cash rate on hold in September, but borrowers should take note that the market is \"100 per cent dialled in\" for a cut in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nSycamore said electricity prices should level out in the next month and inflation could steady. The RBA will be placing more emphasis on quarterly trimmed mean figures due in October.\n\n\n\nIn its latest meeting minutes released on Tuesday, the central bank's board expected the unwinding of energy rebates would boost the headline inflation rate over 2025 and 2026 .\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it was unclear what could further drive core inflation down, HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment was low and steady, capacity utilisation was above its historical average and the economy was still being hamstrung by weak productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

And if someone needed to do it, I'm in the space to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't believe that this is about me. It's not about Mitch Brown being the first at all. For me, it's about sharing my experience so others can feel seen,\" Brown said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he never felt comfortable during his time at West Coast about revealing his sexuality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the locker room and in the spas, the chats were all geared around 'who did everyone pick up on the weekend'? Or, you know, 'she's pretty hot',\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was never once an opportunity to speak openly or explore your feelings or questions in a safe way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember two [players] having a conversation around how they would feel having a shower next to a gay man, and one of the players said, 'I'd rather be in a cage full of lions than have a shower next to a gay man'.\"\n\n\n\n\"There's been so many times in my life that I've seen things or heard things and not said anything, in fear of people thinking that I was gay or bisexual,\" Brown said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eagles were quick to praise Brown on Wednesday, posting: \"We love you, Mitch! We're proud of you and how you're living your values to make footy and our society a better place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown said in the end, his decision to go public was clear-cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't so much hours (of contemplation). It was a moment in time for me, and it was seconds,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had this feeling of peace, but more importantly, comfort and confidence.\"\n\n\n\n\"What matters to me most is a sense of change, a movement created where you can be anyone and feel like you can be anyone and be safe in any environment here in Australia,\" Brown said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hopefully this now provides [that] for the second person.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said his current and former partner, who are women, strongly back him and have praised his courage.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown, 36, played 94 games for the Eagles between 2007 and 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis comments contrast sharply with the AFL Women's, where sexuality has never been an issue and players speak openly about their same-sex relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, former North Melbourne coach and premiership player Danielle Laidley was outed as transgender.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaidley has since spoken at length about what she has been through.\n\n\n\n\n\nAFL chief executive Andrew Dillon, AFL Players' Association president and Collingwood captain Darcy Moore, and AFLW great Emma Kearney were among the people who applauded Brown for his courage.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The Cowboys and Eels are among the clubs that have expressed an interest in acquiring Moale\u2019s services. The Cook Islands international has made 70 first-grade appearances since making his NRL debut in 2021, but a wrist injury suffered in July has prevented him from adding to the tally. Davvy Moale is poised to leave South Sydney. Credit: Getty Images Ironically, Moale could be on the move at a time when the Rabbitohs are already short on middle forwards. The decision to let him go could result in the \u201cPride of the League\u201d freeing up the salary cap funds required to make an offer to enigmatic Titan David Fifita, although his availability may change now that Josh Hannay has been appointed as head coach. Souths are also trying to move unwanted halfback Lewis Dodd from the final two years of his deal. The club is prepared to tip in $500,000 in a bid to make him attractive to suitors, although there hasn\u2019t been any interest at this stage. Former Sports Integrity boss appointed as general manager of Perth Bears\n\nMichael Chammas Former Sports Integrity boss David Sharpe has been appointed as the inaugural general manager of football for the Perth Bears.

David Sharpe has been appointed as the Perth Bears general manager of football. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Sharpe has been a prominent figure in Australian sport for a long time, having formerly served as the CEO of Sport Integrity Australia (SIA) and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA).\n\nHe most recently helped spearhead a SIA review that found gymnasts were abused at the WA Institute of Sport. Sharpe said he was excited to begin his career in rugby league. \u201cI\u2019m honoured to be part of what Anthony and Mal are building because the Perth Bears will put fans and community at the heart of every decision - and that means integrity is a priority,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game of rugby league has given me and my family so much and now it\u2019s time to give back.\u201d Head coach Mal Meninga said it was a crucial appointment for the new club.\n\n\u201cI am excited to work alongside David and continue our long association within the sporting sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI know David is looking forward to this challenge, but I also know his values, integrity and experience will help us establish a best-in-class organisation.\u201d Raiders star ruled out for finals after suffering fractured shoulder The Raiders have been dealt a blow ahead of their finals campaign, with winger Xavier Savage ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season. Scans have revealed Savage fractured his shoulder during the Raiders 20-16 victory against the Panthers on Friday which has been dubbed the \u2018Miracle in Mudgee\u2019 after Canberra scored an unbelievable 95th minute try to win in golden point.\n\nXavier Savage picks up an injury in the first half. Credit: Getty Images Savage will meet with a surgeon this week to find out the extent of the injury and assess whether he will need surgery; however, Canberra confirmed he was no chance of playing finals football. The 23-year-old speedster suffered the injury mid-way through the first half after being tackled by Luke Garner, Blaize Talagi and Isaiah Papali\u2019i while bringing the ball back from a kick return. Savage played the final 16 minutes of the first half following the collision, but failed to return after half-time. The 23-year-old absence for the rest of the season is a massive blow for the club, who have all but wrapped up the 2025 minor premiership. He has scored 12 tries for the Raiders this season.\n\nThe Raiders face the Wests Tigers in Canberra this weekend, before closing out their season against the Dolphins in Redcliffe next week. \u2018I\u2019d love to prove people wrong\u2019: Could Josh Addo-Carr make a shock Roos return? Christian Nicolussi Josh Addo-Carr had three goals at the start of the year: lose weight, return to the NSW Origin team and reclaim his Kangaroos jersey. He has dropped from 97kg to 90kg, missed out on playing for the Blues, but is now making a late-season push to get back on Kevin Walters\u2019 Roos radar.\n\nThe 30-year-old is an outsider to be on the Kangaroo tour in October and November, but his past achievements in the green and gold (he has scored 13 tries for Australia), his on-field chemistry with potential left centre Latrell Mitchell and experience with likely five-eighth Cameron Munster mean he should be in the conversation. As he celebrates 200 NRL games on Friday when the Eels try to continue their nuisance value against the finals-bound New Zealand Warriors, Addo-Carr hopes he has not become the forgotten man for the Kangaroos. Eels teammate Mitchell Moses is also keen to be on the Ashes tour in a squad that will likely include Nathan Cleary, Munster and Tom Dearden. \u201cI sat down at the start of the year and wrote down some goals, which was losing weight \u2013 I\u2019ve done that \u2013 another one was to make Origin, and the third one was to make the Kangaroos squad,\u201d Addo-Carr said.\n\nJosh Addo-Carr has been back to his brilliant best at times in 2025. Credit: Getty Images \u201cYou want to represent your family, and when you play for the Kangaroos, it\u2019s the pinnacle. It means you\u2019re one of the best players in the world in your position, and you\u2019re playing with the best in the world. It\u2019s such a great honour. \u201cI played in England in the World Cup [in 2021], and I haven\u2019t played since. I\u2019d love to be a part of it, as long as I can bring value to the team, on and off the field. It is a long trip over there, so if Kevvie needs me, I\u2019ll put my hand up. \u201cI\u2019ve got that chemistry with Munster \u2013 he\u2019s probably the best player I\u2019ve ever played with. Looking back at the combination we had on that left edge when I was back at the Storm, it\u2019s something I still think about, and he\u2019s a close friend of mine as well. To have an opportunity to play with \u2018Trell\u2019 [Mitchell] as well, it would be mad. \u201cI\u2019d love to prove people wrong. That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d\n\nBrian To\u2019o and Zac Lomax were the starting wingers for NSW during the State of Origin series, but To\u2019o will play for Samoa. Queensland winger Valentine Holmes is out injured, while Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow and Xavier Coates \u2013 arguably the best finisher in the game \u2013 remain a chance of playing for Samoa and Papua New Guinea respectively. Canterbury\u2019s Jacob Kiraz, Roosters flyer Mark Nawaqanitawase and even Manly\u2019s Tom Trbojevic would all be in the mix for a place on the wing. Addo-Carr was thrown a lifeline by Parramatta after parting ways with Canterbury last year. The Bulldogs ripped up the final year of his $500,000-a-season contract after he returned a positive result to cocaine at a roadside police drugs test in September. Moses is also keen to book a ticket to England. The Eels skipper was at his attacking best in the shock win over the Roosters on the weekend.\n\n\u201cI played last year; it\u2019s the highest honour you can get \u2013 we took out the Pacific Champs \u2013 and to play with the best in the game, and rub shoulders with them, and take little things out of their game, it only helps my game,\u201d Moses said. \u201cAny time you get into those camps, it\u2019s the best ever. To pull on the Australian jersey, there\u2019s no better feeling.\u201d Dark horses: Broncos blitz Knights to mount top-four push Brisbane coach Michael Maguire has refused to be drawn into the growing influence of Reece Walsh following the fullback\u2019s starring role in the Broncos\u2019 46-12 win over Newcastle. A six-try second half performance led by Walsh confirmed Brisbane\u2019s place in the NRL finals, as they distanced themselves from the logjam of teams in the middle of the competition ladder with Sunday\u2019s victory at McDonald Jones Stadium.\n\nWalsh overcame several early errors to help Brisbane kick away late, finishing the game with two try assists, 12 tackle breaks and a silky 70-metre solo try to confirm the result. With Brisbane well and truly in the fight for a potential top-four berth heading into the final fortnight of the regular season, Maguire restricted his praise to the team as a whole. \u201cReece makes up a part of the team that builds up the success that we have, and I\u2019d rather talk about how the team is performing,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on building who we are. I\u2019ve seen a shift in how the players have gone about what they\u2019re doing and it\u2019s a credit to them for stepping up to a level that I believe we need to get to. It was a bit clunky at times, but it was pleasing to get through the end of the game with the opportunities they did.\u201d Reece Walsh makes a break for the Broncos. Credit: Getty Images\n\nWith the game in the balance at 20-12 into the final 20 minutes, a likely try to Newcastle five-eighth Jake Arthur was butchered and proved the impetus for a flood of Broncos points. Payne Haas had the ball rolling soon after, before Walsh\u2019s long-range effort put the game beyond doubt. On a day that their opposition typically fear playing in, Newcastle\u2019s Old Boys\u2019 Day proved to be forgettable for the Knights with tries to Gehamat Shibasaki, Jordan Riki and a second for Deine Mariner coming in the final 10 minutes. Newcastle\u2019s seventh straight loss \u2013 and their 10th defeat in their last 11 home games \u2013 has ensured they remain in the battle to avoid the dreaded wooden spoon. \u201cThe last couple of weeks has tested us, clearly. But they have pride in the jersey,\u201d Newcastle coach Adam O\u2019Brien said. \u201cNobody feels the losses more than the playing group. Losing weighs heavily on them. They love playing for their club and their teammates, and they\u2019ll want to go out and perform.\n\n\u201cSome people won\u2019t see it that way given the scoreline \u2026 but these times won\u2019t last so long as we maintain that desire to perform.\u201d In his 350th NRL game \u2013 where he joined Canterbury legend Terry Lamb and long-time Queensland Origin teammate Daly Cherry-Evans as the fourth-most capped player in Australian rugby league history \u2013 veteran playmaker Ben Hunt orchestrated an early flurry for Brisbane. Loading Three minutes was all it took for them to score, with Hunt providing a timely offload for his centre Kotoni Staggs to crash over. The visitors doubled down five minutes later when Josiah Karapani iced a long range shift out wide that started from the hands of the milestone man yet again.",

These are enduring fascinations for choreographers but what makes this evening interesting is the contrast: one work meditates on sameness, while the other insists on difference. Scenarios is playful but also intimate. Credit: Takeshi Kondo Scenarios, created and performed by Benjamin Hurley and Scott Elstermann, plays like a queer duet of self-fascination. Each performs as if the other were a mirror, a copy with no original, doubling gestures until resemblance tips into a kind of dreamy hallucination.\n\nTheir shared identity is really a shared sensibility. A kind of rococo dandyism in duplicate. Movements are upright, measured and immaculately shaped. It\u2019s disciplined dancing, with obsessively worked symmetries, synchronicities and long phrases that develop with tricky vocalisations. They cycle through many images or scenarios. A well-chosen text hints at the thrill of seeing yourself as another, while a darker vignette evokes the doppelg\u00e4nger bent on self-annihilation. Yet the mood remains playful \u2013 even a little screwy \u2013 throughout these transformations. Copy of the Copy is interested in the way dance passes from body to body, teacher to pupil. Credit: Tiffany Garvie It\u2019s cute but also intimate. In the end, the audience itself becomes a reflective medium, placed before the twins like one of the mirrors that organise the space, as if their doubled identities require us to be the final surface in which their resemblance is registered. Priya Srinivasan, by contrast, in Copy of the Copy, is less concerned with uncanny reflections than with the way dance passes from body to body, teacher to pupil. In that transfer, copies are never exact: something is lost and something else is gained.\n\nHer work is resolutely theatrical, combining dance, video, audience interaction and even a little cooking. The registers are also multiple \u2013 comic, earnest, scholarly, confessional \u2013 and they continually shift. The effect is of a layered inquiry, staging transmission itself as a complex, unstable process. Loading Central to the performance is Srinivasan\u2019s own dance lineage: her teachers and the teachers who taught them. As the work culminates, however, we get a more expansive mapping of connections, a deliberately overwhelming series of names stretching from the present to the late eighteenth century, crisscrossing continents, empires and colonies. As the names pile up, distinctions blur: which connections were fleeting encounters and which were nurtured over many years? Yes, we get a sense of the density of intercultural traffic, but the concept of the copy becomes a little vague and underdefined. Finally, while there\u2019s plenty to think about in this production, its success as spectacle rests squarely with the musicians \u2013 Hari Sivanesan, Pirashanna Thevarajah, and Ranjitha Suresh \u2013 whose live presence alongside Srinivasan gives the work its special vitality.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann",

    "text": "Sophie Cape does something I\u2019ve never seen a person do in an exhibition \u2013 puts her hand directly on the canvas and sweeps it across to point out different features and textures.\n\nThis is her work, Thunder shifts the shivering sands, and it has just been named as the 2025 winner of the $100,000 Hadley\u2019s Art Prize. Starting in 2017, the prize, run through Hadley\u2019s Orient Hotel in Hobart, seeks \u201cthe best portrayal of the Australian landscape\u201d.\n\nSophie Cape with her artwork, Thunder shifts the shivering sands. Credit: Jessica King\n\nHer fingertips run across the different shades of rust, charcoal and soil. Cape\u2019s works are created both in and from the environment \u2013 she uses materials found in the places she creates in and travels through, leaving in-progress pieces outdoors and exposed to the elements for months at a time. After being hammered with rain and wind and dust, this work can handle being lightly touched.\n\nCape turned to art after her career as an elite athlete, on track to compete at the Olympics, was abruptly cut short due to injury. \u201cAs an athlete, it\u2019s such a different world, and you commit so much \u2013 you really have no life. It\u2019s just training 24 hours a day for one purpose,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have that any more, you sort of break down.\u201d",
