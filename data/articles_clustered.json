    "text": "The weekly session in which the British prime minister is questioned by lawmakers in Parliament can be an ordeal for the government leader.\n\nFor Cabinet members, it\u2019s usually simply a matter of backing their boss.\n\nBut on Wednesday the spotlight ended up on Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves during the Prime Minister's Questions session because it became evident that she was crying as she sat beside Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Australian actor Julian McMahon dies after private battle with cancer\n\nThis screen grab of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, right, crying as Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London, Wednesday July 2, 2025. (House of Commons/AP)\n\nIt's not known what triggered the tears, later said to have been personal.\n\nThey came as Starmer sought to fend off attacks that his year-old government was losing its authority and that he was about to fire Reeves to regain the initiative.\n\nMarkets spooked\n\nTraders got spooked, with the interest rate charged on the UK\u2019s 10-year benchmark bond in the markets up sharply, and the pound down.\n\nIt's not known what triggered the tears, later said to have been personal. (UK Parliament)\n\nThe moves were a sign investors had lost confidence in UK financial assets.\n\nReeves had become associated with fiscal discipline, in particular a rule of covering day-to-day government spending with tax revenue, said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg Bank.\n\n\u201cThe markets are concerned that if the Chancellor goes, such fiscal discipline would follow her out of the door,\" he added.\n\nWith Starmer insisting on Thursday that Reeves would remain in post, the markets calmed down.\n\nPrime minister's weekly ordeal\n\nPrime Minister's Questions, or PMQs, can come as close to a gladiatorial contest as is possible in a modern legislative chamber.\n\nVery little deference is given to the man or woman holding the highest office in the land.\n\nThe prime minister is considered the first among equals.\n\nBritain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves during a visit to the Sir Ludwig Guttman Health & Wellbeing Centre on July 03, 2025 in London, England.

    "text": "The Australian dollar is enjoying a resurgence as of late, but it's not down to anything special about our local currency.\n\nIn fact, plenty of currencies are performing strongly in 2025, thanks to one surprising laggard: the US dollar.\n\nThis week, the greenback chalked up its worst opening half of a year in more than half a century, dropping 10.7 per cent over the six months to June 30.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump trade war blamed for surprise shrinking of US economy \ufeff\n\nThe US dollar has had its worst start to the year since 1973. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)\n\nNot since 1973, when it fell 15 per cent, has it had a weaker start to the year.\n\nThe US dollar has been the dominant currency across the globe since the end of World War II, currently used for about 90 per cent of all foreign exchange transactions.\n\nSo what's causing it to go backwards?\n\nIn part, it's a bit of a correction.\n\n\"Given the strength in the US dollar in recent years, it has looked overvalued (based on purchasing power parity), especially since the pandemic,\" AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina wrote early this week.\n\n\"So the recent depreciation is probably... a normalisation closer to fair value.\"\n\nBut there are concerns \ufeffthe slide could continue, and in a year when the dominant finance story has been the tariffs thrown around by the White House, it will come as little surprise that Donald Trump is playing a key role.\n\nA hit to US GDP from those tariffs is weighing on investors, as are \ufeffconcerns about debt levels linked to the president's \"Big Beautiful Act\", and his more America-first approach to foreign policy.\n\nThere are also longer-term factors at play \u2013\ufeff in a more polarised world, the proportion of US dollars in foreign exchange reserves has shrunk from about 70 per cent two decades ago to a tick under 60 per cent today.\n\nAll are contributing to concerns that it's no longer the reliable, safe-haven currency it once was.\ufeff\n\n\"If you cannot with certainty take a view on the position of the US administration, it's hard to commit capital,\" Arun Sai, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said.\n\n\"What we've seen with the current administration in the last few months is that this notion of the US being a default destination for global capital is being challenged.\"\n\nBut another significant issue for the greenback is what Trump's been saying about US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , who on Thursday (Australian time) admitted he would likely have cut interest rates were it not for the White House's tariffs.\n\nREAD MORE: Retirement crisis coming for millions of Aussies \ufeff\n\nTrump's attacks on Jerome Powell have been weighing on the US dollar. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)\n\n\ufeffIn Australia, you'll pretty much never hear Treasurer Jim Chalmers say \"Reserve Bank\" without uttering \"the independent\" first.\n\nTrump has no such qualms about trying to influence his central bank, having constantly belittled Powell in an attempt to get him to lower interest rates, and therefore make borrowing cheaper for the government.\n\nThe president has variously labelled Powell \"a total and complete moron\"\ufeff, \"stupid\", \"a dumb guy\", \"average mentally\", \"a very stupid person\", and \"low IQ for what he does\" \u2013 and that's just in the last two weeks.\n\nHe's also sent a handwritten note to the Fed demanding ultra-low interest rates, saying the US's cash rate should be \"1 per cent... or better\".\n\nIt's currently above 4 per cent.\ufeff\n\nTrump has threatened to fire Powell \u2013 who he actually appointed during his first term before an extension by Joe Biden \u2013 and called for him to resign, and said last week that he already \ufeffhas a shortlist of replacements, fuelling speculation he could announce a successor well before Powell's term expires next year.\n\nInvestors have been concerned about the Federal Reserve's independence under Donald Trump. (CNN)\n\nThat would be a \"terrible idea\", AGF Investments chief US policy strategist Greg Valliere said, as it would be \"sure to annoy and confuse the financial markets if there are two Fed chairs\".\n\n\"The damage to the Fed's independence would be considerable if Trump becomes a monetary back-seat driver, second-guessing Fed policies,\" he said.\n\nIt's those independence concerns that are proving detrimental to the US dollar. \ufeff\n\n\"One of the key foundations of the strong dollar, of the dollar as a dominant currency globally, is to have an independent central bank,\" ING foreign exchange strategist Francesco Pesole said.\n\n\"So, if [global investors] feel there is greater influence of politics into the Fed's decisions, then they are pricing in a greater risk for the dollar.\"\n\nThat said, there's no obvious replacement for the greenback as the world's international currency, despite a host of countries including China, Russia, India, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa wanting one.\n\n\ufeff\"There has been talk about these countries using a new currency called 'The Unit', which would be... a digital currency on the blockchain,\" Mousina wrote.\n\nThe Australian dollar is likely to keep rising over the next 12 months, although interest rate cuts will limit just how high it will go. (Fairfax Media)\n\n\"But setting up a potential new currency faces many hurdles, particularly from the Western world that dominates the financial markets and global payments system.\"\n\nThere could be a little more good news for Australian travellers to the US, with AMP forecasting the Aussie dollar will buy just under 70 cents by mid-to-late next year.\n\nBut against other currencies, it's likely to remain fairly stable, and the greenback's slide \u2013 if it continues \u2013 could have complex and far-reaching consequences.\n\n\"If the US dollar loses its safe-haven status, then the Australian dollar may fall less in times of uncertainty,\" Mousina said.\n\n\"[This] will impact its role as a shock absorber for the Australian economy (like when it fell in the GFC and pandemic, which boosted our exports and supported the economy).\n\n\"This may put more pressure on the RBA to support growth in time of global shocks.\"\n\n\u2013 With CNN \ufeff",

    "text": "Texas parents frantically posted photos of their young daughters on social media with pleas for information as more than 20 campers from an all-girls summer camp were unaccounted for Friday after floods tore through the state's south-central region overnight.\n\nAt least 13 people were dead and dozens missing after months worth of heavy rain fell in a matter of hours on Texas Hill Country, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said. The flood-prone region is dotted with century-old summer camps that draw thousands of kids annually from across the Lone Star State.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick said about 23 girls attending Camp Mystic, a Christian camp along the Guadalupe River in Hunt, Texas, were unaccounted for Friday afternoon. Search teams were working to conduct helicopter and boat rescues in the fast-moving floodwaters.\n\nA flood gauge marks the height of water flowing over a farm-to-market road near Kerrville, Texas. (AP)\n\n\"I'm asking the people of Texas, do some serious praying this afternoon \u2014 on-your-knees kind of praying \u2014 that we find these young girls,\" Patrick said.\n\nDozens of families shared in local Facebook groups that they received devastating phone calls from safety officials informing them that their daughters had not yet been located among the washed-away camp cabins and downed trees. Some were waiting to hear if their children could be evacuated by helicopter. Nine rescue teams, 14 helicopters and 12 drones were being used in the search, Patrick said.\n\nCamp Mystic said in an email to parents that if they have not been contacted directly, their child is accounted for. Safety officials said there were roughly 750 campers.\n\nAt an elementary school in nearby Ingram that was being used as a reunification centre, more than a hundred people milled around a courtyard with hopes of seeing their loved one step out of buses dropping off those who had been evacuated. One young girl wearing a Camp Mystic T-shirt stood in a puddle in her white socks, sobbing in her mother's arms as she rubbed her hands together and watched the buses arrive.\n\nMany families hoped to see loved ones who had been at campgrounds and mobile home parks in the area.\n\nCamp Mystic sits on a strip known as \"flash flood alley,\" said Austin Dickson, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, a charitable endowment that is collecting donations to help nonprofits responding to the disaster.\n\n\"When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,\" Dickson said. \"It rushes down the hill.\"\n\nDecades prior, floodwaters engulfed a bus of teenage campers from another Christian camp along the Guadalupe River during devastating summer storms in 1987. A total of 10 campers from Pot O' Gold Christian camp drowned after their bus was unable to evacuate in time from a site near Comfort, 53km east of Hunt.\n\nLeaders at Camp Mystic said they are without power, Wi-Fi and running water, and the highway leading to the camp has washed away.\n\nTwo other camps on the river, Camp Waldemar and Camp La Junta, said in Instagram posts that all campers and staff there were safe.\n\nWater rises from severe flooding along the Guadalupe River.in Kerr County, Texas. (AP)\n\nOne family survives a terrifying ordeal\n\nErin Burgess\u2019 home sits directly across from the river in the Bumble Bee Hills neighborhood, west of Ingram. When she woke up to thunder at 3:30 a.m. Friday morning, \u201cit was raining pretty heavy, but no big deal,\u201d she said.\n\nJust 20 minutes later, Burgess said water was coming in through the walls and rushing through the front and back doors. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree and waiting for the water to recede enough that they were able to walk up the hill to a neighbor's.\n\n\u201cMy son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them,\u201d she said, becoming emotional.\n\nOf her 19-year-old son, Burgess said: \u201cThankfully he\u2019s over 6 feet tall. That\u2019s the only thing that saved me, was hanging on to him.\u201d\n\nA flood watch issued Thursday afternoon estimated isolated amounts up to 17cm of rising water. That shifted to a flood warning for at least 30,000 people overnight.\n\nWhen asked about the suddenness of the flash flooding, Kelly said \u201cwe do not have a warning system\u201d and that \u201cwe didn\u2019t know this flood was coming,\u201d even as local reporters pointed to the warnings and pushed him for answers about why more precautions weren\u2019t taken.\n\n\u201cRest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States.\u201d\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said the state was providing resources to Hill Country communities dealing with the flooding, including in Kerrville, Ingram and Hunt.\n\nThe Texas Hill Country, a scenic and rocky gateway to booming vineyards and vacation rentals, begins west of the state capital and is a popular outdoor summer getaway. Parts of the region are prone to flash flooding.\n\nIngram Fire Department posted a photo of a statement from Camp Mystic, saying the private Christian summer camp for girls experienced \u201ccatastrophic level floods.\u201d Parents with a daughter not accounted for were directly contacted, the camp said.\n\nA raging Guadalupe River leaves fallen trees and debris in its wake. (AP)\n\nThe Guadalupe\u2019s river gauge at the unincorporated community of Hunt, where the river forks, recorded a 6.7m in just about two hours, according to Bob Fogarty, meteorologist with the National Weather Service\u2019s Austin/San Antonio office. Fogarty said the gauge failed after recording a level of nine metres.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of thing that will catch you unaware,\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cThe water\u2019s moving so fast, you\u2019re not going to recognize how bad it is until it\u2019s on top of you.\u201d\n\nAreas east along the Guadalupe River were preparing for their own flooding as the rapid waters rushed downstream from Hunt and Kerrville. In Kendall County, home to the unincorporated community of Comfort, the sheriff\u2019s office sounded the alarm.\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform everyone that the flood situation in Comfort is not improving,\u201d the post read. \u201cWe have sounded the flood sirens and urge all residents in low-lying areas of town to evacuate immediately.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey also sees deaths due to severe weather\n\nMeanwhile, strong thunderstorms were being blamed for at least three deaths in central New Jersey, including two men in Plainfield who died after a tree fell onto a vehicle they were traveling in during the height of a storm there, according to a city Facebook post.\n\nThe men were ages 79 and 25, officials said. They were not immediately publicly identified.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are heavy today,\u201d Mayor Adrian O. Mapp said in a statement. \u201cThis tragedy is a sobering reminder of the power of nature and the fragility of life.\u201d\n\nThe city canceled its planned July Fourth parade, concert and fireworks show. Mapp said the \u201cdevastating\u201d storms had left \u201cdeep scars and widespread damage\u201d in the community of more than 54,000 people and it was a time to \u201cregroup and focus all of our energy on recovery.\u201d",

(Supplied)\n\n\"How [did] he ever imagine he would find somewhere in the middle of the Northern Territory?\" marvelled Tom Guthrie, who published a book about the epic sheep drive in 2014.\n\nInitially, Tom's knowledge of the story, gleaned from excerpts in his great-grandfather's memoirs, was patchy.\n\nThen a stroke of luck delivered him a thrilling discovery.\n\nFound in a bin, published decades later\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame published an account of the sheep drive sent to it by retired former governor-general Sir Paul Hasluck.\n\nAs a young journalist at The West Australian newspaper in the 1930s, Hasluck had rescued a short, typed manuscript from the office wastepaper bin.\n\nIt was the first-hand account of the epic droving trip, written by Wallace Caldwell 50 years after the event.\n\nSir Paul Hasluck speaking in Sydney in 1970.

But wild dogs and the tropical heat took their toll and, eventually, after several decades, the sheep were replaced with cattle.\n\nWhile writing the book, Tom discovered Caldwell had completed another epic droving trip in 1890, fording flooded rivers to move 11,000 sheep from the Thomson River in western Queensland to Bourke, in NSW.\n\nHe then tried prospecting, selected land near Bunbury in Western Australia, and retired to Perth, where he died in 1941 at the age of 80.\n\nSeveral years ago, Tom discovered Caldwell's grave was unmarked.\n\nAerial view of the woolshed at Rich Avon Station in Victoria, where the 1882 sheep drive began.

(ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nSam comes from a country where being gay is considered \"against the order of nature\" and is enough to land them more than a decade in jail.\n\nThey said it's a place where civilians \"take matters into their own hands\" and turn their neighbours in, where intimate details of someone's life are shamed in the media.\n\nIt wasn't until Sam came to Australia as a teenager that they were free to explore their sexuality for the first time \u2014 albeit in secret from their parents.\n\n\"I was more comfortable with just being myself and expressing that part of myself,\" they said.\n\nThrough Australia's refugee convention, Sam was able to apply for asylum and can now live freely with their girlfriend without having to hide. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nSo, when their family's application for permanent residency was knocked back, and the possibility of returning loomed large, Sam took matters into their own hands.\n\n\"I was like, 'no, I can't go back, I can't hide myself anymore,'\" Sam said.\n\n\" I don't think I would have been safe physically if I expressed myself, and then if I hid myself, I don't think I would have been safe mentally, so it was like [being] stuck between a rock and a hard place. \"\n\nLGBTQIA+ people with a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country based on their gender or sexuality can be considered refugees under Australia's Migration Act.\n\nSam turned to the Tasmanian Refugee Legal Service (TRLS), arguing to the Department of Home Affairs that being gay exposed them to serious harm.\n\nTheir application for permanent protection was successful.\n\nSam turned to the Tasmanian Refugee Legal Service for assistance.

Or even buy a bigger jacket. \"\n\nA dog obtained this wound under its left leg from a jacket. (Supplied: Limestone Coast Vet)\n\nPrior to the past month, Dr Priddle said she had rarely seen the issue before.\n\n\"This winter, certainly, I think feels a lot colder than the previous winter so that may be a factor,\" she said.\n\n'Not a fashion accessory'\n\nUniversity of Adelaide associate professor Susan Hazel, who specialises in research into animal welfare, behaviour and ethics, said the injury seen by Dr Priddle was \"horrific\" but she had not heard of similar cases.\n\nSusan Hazel is a researcher at the University of Adelaide's Roseworthy campus. (Supplied: University of Adelaide's Lumen magazine)\n\nShe said the market for pet-related merchandise was going up every year.\n\n\"I suspect some of them [jackets and jumpers] are on platforms where they're just put out really rapidly without thinking of the welfare of the pet, that they might cut in and things,\" she said.\n\nDr Hazel said to consider jackets with thicker straps so the pressure from them could be better distributed on the dog's skin.\n\nDo dogs need to wear jackets in winter? Photo shows A small white and brown dog wearing a grey puffer jacket, surrounded by autumn leaves How necessary is it for your dog to wear a jacket, and what else can you do to keep them warm in winter?\n\n\"It's not a fashion accessory. It should be something that's used to keep them dry or keep them warm,\" she said.\n\n\" If a dog was outside then providing a kennel, or an area which is more enclosed with blankets as well, would keep them warm without necessarily needing a jacket. \"\n\nShe said hot weather was more of a concern for dogs wearing jackets since they could not sweat and could develop hot spots exacerbated by moisture.\n\nOwners keep up with fashion\n\nLeisa McKinnon's French bulldog Patrick has two jackets for walks and another two when at home.\n\nShe said she made sure to choose clothes that had sleeves rather than straps, or were stretchy to prevent injuries.\n\n\"Frenchies overheat pretty easily, but then they do feel the cold as well,\" she said.\n\nLeisa McKinnon with French bulldog Patrick on a cold winter morning. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nIan Wheller's golden retriever Otis wore a denim jacket during 2 degrees Celsius weather on Wednesday.\n\nHe said it was more of a fashion statement than a necessity because of his dog's thick coat.\n\n\"It's got nice, big armholes for him so it's quite comfortable on him.

    "text": "England had big centuries from Harry Brook and Jamie Smith but little else to celebrate as India stayed in control of the second Test on a turbulent day three at Edgbaston.\n\nResuming on 3-77 in reply to India's mammoth first-innings 587, England lost Joe Root and Ben Stokes to successive balls from Mohammed Siraj in the second over but recovered brilliantly thanks to a 303-run stand by Brook (158) and Smith (a career-best 184 not out).\n\nAfter taking the second new ball, India claimed England's last five wickets for 20 runs in just 44 balls to dismiss the home team for 407 \u2014 Brook and Smith accounted for 342 of those runs \u2014 and take a lead of 180 into the second innings.\n\nEngland had a remarkable six ducks in total and Siraj had figures of 6-70.\n\nBatting under cloud cover, the Indians reached stumps on 1-64 \u2014 with only the loss of Yashasvi Jaiswal (28) \u2014 and will resume 244 runs ahead and with a series-tying victory in their sights.\n\nLokesh Rahul was unbeaten on 28 alongside Karun Nair, on 7.\n\n\"We are quite ahead right now,\" Siraj said.\n\n\"But the plan is to get as many runs on the board because we know their attacking mindset.\"\n\nEngland was in a big hole that looked gargantuan when Root and Stokes departed to leave their side on 5-84 and still trailing by more than 500 runs.\n\nSiraj dismissed England's best batter \u2014 Root for 22 \u2014 by enticing a nick down the leg side, with wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant taking a diving catch, and then its captain for a golden duck.\n\nStokes trudged back to the dressing room after a steeply rising and seaming delivery came off the shoulder of his bat and flashed to Pant.\n\nEngland was rocked, but Smith and Brook played as if there was no pressure with a counterattacking riposte.\n\n\"Hopefully we've clawed ourselves back in the game,\" Brook said.\n\n\"I just tried to bat as long as I could and Smudge [Smith] tried to get the momentum back our way. He's a phenomenal player.\"\n\nSmith came in to face a hat-trick ball, struck that for four, and went on to make the biggest score by an England wicketkeeper, surpassing Alec Stewart.\n\nHe raced to his second Test hundred before lunch in just 80 balls \u2014 the third fastest by an Englishman \u2014 including an over when he pulled and smashed Prasidh Krishna for a six and four fours. Smith was dropped by Pant on 121 off a tough chance.\n\nBrook compiled his ninth test hundred in 27 matches, getting to three figures \u2014 courtesy of a classy late cut for four \u2014 after being dismissed for 99 in the first Test won by England at Headingley last week.\n\nNightwatchman Lyon makes it to stumps after openers out cheaply Photo shows Jayden Seales raises his hand to celebrate as Australia batter Sam Konstas stands in the foreground. Sam Konstas chops on in the first over of the second innings and Usman Khawaja is trapped LBW after the West Indian tail scores valuable runs on day two in the second Test.\n\nBrook, a star for England in all formats, reined in some slight frustration at India changing tactics and bowling wide outside off-stump to a lopsided field and looked good after going down with cramp.\n\nSoon afterward, he was bowled by Akash Deep (4-88) \u2014 armed with the second new ball \u2014 and was serenaded as he walked off gingerly.\n\nThat precipitated England's late-order collapse that saw Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue and Shaoib Bashir all being removed for ducks, joining Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope and Stokes.\n\nTongue responded by trapping Jaiswal LBW but India finished the day in the driving seat.\n\n\"If I hadn't got out, we would not be in this situation now,\" Brook said.\n\n\"But we saw last week how quickly it can change.\n\n\"Hopefully we can put pressure with early wickets and make them crumble.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(Supplied: Karen Eley)\n\nSo, what are the options for those who want, or need, to retire early?\n\nIt will depend on whether you're relying on the age pension or superannuation for income.\n\nThis article contains general information only. You should consider obtaining independent professional advice in relation to your particular circumstances.\n\nWhen can I access my super?\n\nYou can access your super when you reach 65 years old, even if you're still working and haven't retired.\n\nBut you can also access your super earlier if you've reached your preservation age and satisfy the work/retirement criteria.\n\nPreservation age is between 55 and 60 years old, but it depends on the year you were born.\n\nFor Australians born after July 1, 1964, the preservation age is 60.\n\nOnce you have reached your preservation age, you can either fully retire or start a transition to a retirement income stream while continuing to work.\n\nThat means you may be able to reduce your working hours without reducing your income when you reach your preservation age.\n\nYour part-time working income may be supplemented with your super savings as a transition to a retirement income stream.\n\nWhen can I access the pension?\n\nYou can get the age pension from the age of 67 if you are living in Australia and have been an Australian resident for the last 10 years.\n\nBut you have to meet an income and asset test.\n\nTo get a full pension there are limits on the value of the assets you can have.\n\nThe government includes most real estate assets you own in your assets test.\n\nBut this generally doesn't include your principal home and up to the first 2 hectares of land it's on.\n\nAssets also include income streams and superannuation pensions.\n\nThe asset limits for a full pension:\n\nYour situation Homeowner Non-homeowner Single $321,500 $579,500 A couple, combined $481,500 $739,500 A couple, separated due to illness, combined $481,500 $739,500 A couple, one partner eligible, combined $481,500 $739,500\n\nAnd, the asset limits for a part pension are as follows:\n\nYour situation Homeowner Non-homeowner Single $704,500 $962,500 A couple, combined $1,059,000 $1,317,000 A couple, separated due to illness, combined $1,247,500 $1,505,500 A couple, one partner eligible, combined $1,059,000 $1,317,000\n\nThe normal rates of the age pension before tax is:\n\nPer fortnight Single Couple each Couple combined Couple apart due to ill health Maximum basic rate $1,051.30 $792.50 $1,585.00 $1,051.30 Maximum Pension Supplement $83.60 $63.00 $126.00 $83.60 Energy Supplement $14.10 $10.60 $21.20 $14.10 Total $1,149.00 $866.10 $1,732.20 $1,149.00\n\nWhat if I'm not that old but can't work anymore?\n\nYou can access your super early but under limited circumstances.\n\nThese include:\n\nCompassionate grounds \u2014 to pay for medical treatment, palliative care, funeral expenses and preventing the forced sale of a home.\n\nIf you have a terminal medical condition.\n\nIf you are permanently incapacitated \u2014 sometimes known as \"disability super benefit\".\n\nYour fund must be satisfied that you have a permanent physical or mental medical condition that is likely to stop you from ever working again in a job you were qualified to do.\n\nDo you know more? Contact Fiona Blackwood at blackwood.fiona@abc.net.au.\n\nYou may also be able to access any income protection insurance you hold within your funds.\n\nSevere financial hardship \u2014 this is assessed by your super fund and can include things like being unemployed and not being able to meet your mortgage payments.\n\nA lump sum is generally limited to $10,000.\n\nThere may be tax consequences to early withdrawals depending on your age.\n\nAre there any other alternatives to help me retire?\n\nA reverse mortgage allows you to borrow money using the equity in your home as security. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)\n\nFinancial coach Karen Eley says while it is not ideal, people who own their own homes can use a reverse mortgage to access funds.\n\n\"This lending facility allows you to borrow money against your home, without requiring repayment until you pass away or sell the property,\" she said.\n\nShe said it's important to get independent advice to make sure you understand what you're signing up for \"as essentially you are creating a debt against your home that will need to be repaid in the future.\"\n\n\" It can however provide financial assistance in the form of accessing the equity in your home if you have a mortgage-free property. \"\n\nThe Australian Securities & Investment Commission's (ASIC) Moneysmart website has a calculator that can help work out how much you could potentially borrow.\n\nDownsizing a home can help those looking to retire early, Ms Eley says. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nMs Eley said downsizing your home was another possible strategy to help those needing to retire early.\n\n\"If your family home is worth $700,000 and you can find a property to live in for $500,000 perhaps relocating to a smaller house or more affordable suburb, you can use the difference in the sale and purchase price to inject money into your super, or use it to live on until you meet super or age pension eligibility requirements,\" she said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian Tax Office (ATO) said if you have turned 60 or retired, you may be eligible for tax offsets.\n\nThis will depend on your income and assets, where your income comes from, and whether you're fully or partly retired.\n\nIf your super benefits won't fully support you when you retire, you may also qualify for a part-pension.\n\nAnd, in recognition that it is harder for an older person to find employment, those over 55 who have spent nine months on JobSeeker receive an extra $55 a fortnight.\n\nWhere can I get help?\n\nMs Eley says there can be long-term implications for accessing your super earlier than your preservation age. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nMoneysmart has information and tools to help you prepare to retire.\n\nYour super fund may also offer a range of calculators to help you.\n\nFor more personalised information and advice, you can contact your super fund or a registered financial adviser.\n\nMs Eley said there could be long-term implications for accessing your super earlier than your preservation age.\n\n\"Mortgage brokers or banks can also provide you information about accessing the equity in your home if you're over 60.\n\n\"However, it's important to understand the costs and the long-term impacts on drawing down on the equity in your home through these loans,\" she said.",

    "text": "It's late afternoon on a wintry Saturday in Bairnsdale, eastern Victoria, and a small crowd has gathered around a roped-off area of a textile craft store.\n\nThe onlookers have come to Liz Green Arts to watch seven expert hand spinners and knitters race against the clock with intense concentration.\n\nThe East Gippsland Wool and Craft Group is quietly taking part in the International Back to Back Wool Challenge, a worldwide event in which teams compete for the fastest time to blade-shear a sheep, spin the wool and knit a jumper within a day.\n\nFour teams from Victoria competed in the 2025 Back to Back Wool Challenge. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\nThe team took first place in Australia in 2007, and second internationally, with a time of six hours, 10 minutes and eight seconds.\n\nAnother Australian team, from Merriwa in New South Wales, broke the five-hour barrier in 2004 and held the Guinness World Record for the event up until 2017 when the Netherlands beat the record by about six minutes, with a time of four hours 45 minutes and 53 seconds.\n\nThe competitors may be racing the clock, but their efforts are all about celebrating slow manufacturing, using locally grown and sustainably produced wool to make garments by hand from scratch.\n\nOld-fashioned blade shearing is a requirement of the Back to Back Wool Challenge. (Supplied: Liz Green Arts)\n\nManufacturing by hand\n\nThe East Gippsland Wool and Craft Group kept a few sheep on standby in a pen for the challenge and a change of plan had them switch from white to brown sheep fleece.\n\n\"We had to set up fences for the sheep, we had a few options of sheep, but unfortunately two of them decided to roll in poop this morning so they were instantly disqualified, which is why we ended up with such a lovely brown fleece,\" says Toni Collis, the group's treasurer.\n\nThe poop indiscretion of the English Leicester cross costs the team an hour and half in blade-shearing time, and the clean fleece is retrieved and relayed to the group's hand spinners.\n\nToni Collis with the natural wool that was spun and knitted into a jumper. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\nThe competition rules state that the sheep cannot be housed or clothed to protect the fleece and that the sheep and sheared fleece cannot be washed, leaving the fleece in its most natural, aromatic state \u2014 dirt and all.\n\nSpinning wheels feature interchangeable bobbins to ensure a speedy workflow, as the wool is spun by two hand spinners then plied by a third.\n\nThe wool is then handed over to four knitters, who knit straight from the bobbins.\n\nThe Back to Back Wool Challenge will celebrate its 30th year in 2026. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\n\"There are four parts to the jumper: one front, one back, two sleeves,\" Ms Collis says.\n\n\"Some of our faster knitters started on the pieces for our slower knitters earlier to get them going.\"\n\nPieces of the jumper are swapped between faster and slower knitters to create consistent progress with the pieces, and knitters swap with spinners to avoid cramping with different muscles and movements.\n\nThis year the team is racing to try to finish within 10 hours.\n\nFour knitters are each assigned a piece of the jumper to work on: the front, back or a sleeve. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\nSustainable fibres\n\nThe Back to Back Wool Challenge plays into a broader movement of knitters and craft makers seeking locally grown, naturally produced fibres that haven't been processed overseas with chemicals, dyes or synthetic additives.\n\nAs with the food, wine and paddock-to-plate movement, wool connoisseurs want to know the story behind the products they are purchasing, their carbon footprint in freight, and processing, and are prepared to pay more for a premium, sustainably produced product.\n\nJulianne Sargant says her Woollen Witchery yarns take two years to produce. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\nWool producer Julianne Sargant is the daughter of a 90-year-old merino sheep farmer based in Omeo and was a spectator at this year's challenge.\n\nMs Sargant says that events like Back to Back help people appreciate the effort that goes into creating fibres.\n\n\"When you actually do this yourself, you realise the effort that it takes to actually create fibre,\" she says.\n\nThe Back to Back event is a little different from Ms Sargant's usual process.\n\nTurning her father's 18 micron merino wool into yarn, she hand dyes it across a number of cauldrons, inspiring the Woollen Witchery brand name.\n\n\"I hand dye with plants from the farm and the garden, like gum leaves, and I grow my own indigo and marigolds, and I use Omeo gum, blue gum and narrow-leaved peppermint to colour wool,\" she says.\n\nWoollen Witchery products are hand dyed with flowers and botanicals from Julianne Sargant's family property. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\nMs Sargant says her father has spent his life breeding sheep and mitigating seasonal variations in their fibres by providing the right mix of nutrition.\n\nThe best wool is selected, 200 kilograms of it is sent to one of two remaining commercial scouring facilities in Australia, EP Robinson in Geelong, where it is commercially washed to remove any lanolin grease that may clog machinery.\n\nThe painstaking process of making low-carbon, non-synthetic textiles from scratch is back in vogue. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\nIt is then sent on to Cashmere Connections at Bacchus Marsh, where it is turned into a fluffy tube of aligned fibres known as \"tops\".\n\nThe wool then either heads to the Great Ocean Road Woollen Mill in Ballarat, or the Adagio Woollen Mill in the Blue Mountains for further processing before returning to Omeo as skeins of wool.\n\nIt can be a two-year process to create the wool and a skein costs upwards of $30.\n\nConsumers are willing to pay more for locally grown, sustainably processed premium-quality wool. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\n\"It's the quality of the product and it's the traceability. You know where it's come from,\" Ms Sargant says.\n\n\" You can talk to the farmer that's grown it and as for sustainability, it doesn't have to travel all around the world to come back to us as something else. \"\n\nGarments worn for a lifetime\n\nWhile the East Gippsland Wool and Craft Group hoped to return Australia to the top of the international rankings, this year it didn't pan out.\n\nThe fastest team was the US's San Diego County Spinners, who took out top spot in the worldwide challenge with a time of seven hours and 12 minutes.\n\nThe East Gippsland Wool and Craft Group came seventh with a time of 13 hours, eight minutes and 21 secs, while raising $300 for a local children's cancer charity in the process.\n\nThe East Gippsland Wool and Craft Group will raffle off the completed jumper. (Supplied: Liz Green Arts)\n\nMs Sargent says locally produced wool \u2014 like that highlighted at Back to Back \u2014 is popular at wool shows attended by \"yarn addicts\".\n\nSome of the more popular events are the Canberra Wool Expo, the Coburg Market and the Bendigo Sheep and Wool Show.\n\nMs Sargant says people who make their own garments using locally produced wool are less likely to throw them away, resulting in a more sustainable lifestyle.\n\n\"If it doesn't leave this shore you're saving all those carbon miles to start with,\" she says.\n\n\" If you make it yourself you'll look after it, repair it and you'll wear it for a lifetime. \"",

    "text": "Australia's bowlers have taken matters into their own hands, Steve Smith has made a clutch call and a furry friend has invaded the outfield.\n\nHere are five quick hits from the second day of the second Test in Grenada. Tap here for a full wrap of the day two action.\n\n1. Fine, I'll do it myself\n\nJosh Hazlewood took an impressive return catch early on day two. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nThere is always a physical burden that goes with being a Test bowler, but Australia's attack has shouldered a particularly heavy load as the batters have struggled in recent times.\n\nAt the start of day two, after their 14th first-innings score under 300 from the past two and a half years, it was once again on the bowlers to try and get the team back on top.\n\nAnd they really took it completely on themselves, with Josh Hazlewood completing a sharp return catch off the 11th ball of the innings to get rid of Kraigg Brathwaite for a duck in his 100th Test before Pat Cummins went even better in his first over with a superb diving one-hander to remove Keacy Carty.\n\n2. That's gotta hurt\n\n\"How could you hurt me like this?\" \u2014 Steve Smith, presumably. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nSteve Smith had a compound dislocation of his finger less than three weeks ago, but still took his place in the second Test in the Caribbean.\n\nHe was wisely not allowed to field in the slips to the seamers, which was how he injured his right pinky in the World Test Championship final, but he was still going to be called upon.\n\nIt didn't take long for the finger to be tested out as he was forced to chase a ball to the rope in the fourth over on day two, saving a boundary and hurling the ball back into the middle.\n\nImmediately he winced and withdrew his hand, doing so repeatedly throughout the day almost every time he had to use that hampered right wing, but the real challenge will be batting.\n\nSmith's batting innings only lasted six balls in the first dig, but being such a bottom-hand batter, it will take a mighty effort to push through the pain barrier.\n\n3. Campbell gives it away\n\nFor much of the opening session, West Indies opener John Campbell did not look like a player with a Test match average of 25.50.\n\nHe pulled Hazlewood for six and smashed Starc straight back past him as he made his way to a domineering 40 from 52 deliveries.\n\nAnd after seeing off spells from both of the Australian opening bowlers, he looked to up the ante even further against the medium pace of Beau Webster.\n\nBut attempting to smash the all-rounder to the leg-side fence, Campbell miscued one horribly, falling straight down the throat of Mitchell Starc at mid-on.\n\nIt was an ugly end to an innings of such promise and a conclusion all too familiar for West Indies fans.\n\nCampbell has made it to 20 on 21 occasions over the course of his 22-match Test career. Only thrice has he got to 50.\n\n4. Doggo disruption\n\nProfessional sports are no strangers to animal invaders and we got a good one on day two in Grenada.\n\nWith Josh Hazlewood at the top of his mark in the 33rd over, a smallish black dog appeared in the outfield behind the bowler.\n\nThere was no great urgency from any officials at the ground, with Pat Cummins jogging over from mid-on to calmly usher the pooch off the park and towards the stands to allow play to continue.\n\nOften a break in play can ruin a batter's rhythm, but that wasn't the case for Brandon King, who stood up and pulled Josh Hazlewood for a massive six only seconds after the curious canine exited the outfield.\n\n5. Smith takes charge\n\nA key attribute of a good Test match captain is knowing when to send a decision upstairs.\n\nWith only three incorrect decisions allowed per innings, the DRS can make or break a game.\n\nSo, when Alex Carey thought he had Brandon King caught behind off the bowling of Nathan Lyon, a massive call had to be made.\n\nBut who was going to make it?\n\nWith captain Cummins momentarily off the field, the appealing Australians turned to his second-in-command Steve Smith, who made the executive decision to have it looked at more closely.\n\nIt proved to be a masterstroke, with ultraedge providing enough evidence to send King back to the pavilion for 75.",

    "text": "Shirley McRae remembers how much her insurance cost when she first bought her house back in 2010.\n\nIt was \"$984 for the whole lot, that being flooding, contents and home insurance\", Ms McRae says.\n\nBut after repeated, more frequent natural disasters her premiums have skyrocketed, making it difficult to justify insuring her NSW Mid North Coast home.\n\n\"My view was that my house never flooded. So why would I pay such a high premium when it's never flooded?\"\n\nIn the years since then, her 120-year-old house has flooded twice \u2014 in 2021 and again this year.\n\nInsurance premiums are now in the tens of thousands of dollars a year for Ms McRae, if insurance companies are even willing to cover her.\n\nThe front of Shirley McRae's house after the Manning River flooded in May 2025. (Supplied: Tracey Stevenson)\n\nIt is not just people on the flood plain feeling the pain.\n\nAcross the board, premiums for all policyholders are expected to continue to rise after a string of natural disasters this year.\n\nThe Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) said it was part of a 20-year trend.\n\n\"What we are seeing is that, collectively, extreme weather events and their growing frequency and intensity are having an impact on all premiums,\" ICA's general manager of public affairs, Matthew Jones, said.\n\n\"That's why we've seen premiums rise at very significant levels over the past couple of years.\"\n\nRising premiums across the board\n\nGenerally, insurers price their policies with an eye on a multitude of risk factors: where you live, what your house is made of, as well as factoring in the cost of running their business, inflation, and international pressures on the global reinsurance market.\n\nThe ICA says the total amount claimed on insurance has been around $1.8 billion for the past financial year \u2014 all resulting from three natural disasters in parts of New South Wales and Queensland in the first six months of 2025.\n\nMichael Sherris, emeritus professor in actuarial studies from UNSW, said every time these severe weather events occurred, insurance companies raised their premiums and re-rated their policies to factor in the costs they have had to pay out.\n\n\"They have to cover the cost somehow, so they'll spread it across more policyholders and across time,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies are profit-making, they've got shareholders, so they're trying to maximise their profits.\n\n\"The fact that they have incurred more and more costs than planned will mean there's more and more pressure for them to put up their premiums to stay solvent and operating.\"\n\nMichael Sherris is concerned that people may opt for no insurance as premiums become more expensive. (Supplied)\n\nThe ICA found that since extreme weather events, like the 2019\u201320 Black Summer bushfires and the 2022 floods, premiums across Australia had been rising.\n\n\"Insurers have had to play catch-up and replenish their resources so that they can continue to pay claims into the future,\" Mr Jones said.\n\n\"It's the case that people in more flood-prone areas all around Australia, all up and down the east coast, their premiums rose more than other people's because insurers are very aware of the risk of flooding on the east coast of Australia.\"\n\nRecent analysis from the ICA found that of the estimated 225,000 homes in the highest-flood-risk locations across Australia, only about 23 per cent had flood cover.\n\nFlood cover in these locations costs as much as $30,000 per year.\n\nThe cost of underinsurance\n\nLast year, a federal House of Representatives inquiry into flood insurance claims following major flooding in 2022 recommended that the government force insurers to be more transparent about their pricing.\n\nThe inquiry suggested this could take the form of a traffic light rating system to show the level of risk a property has, or a descriptive analysis about why the premium is rising.\n\nAs premiums continued to rise, Mr Sherris was concerned that more people would not renew their insurance or would be underinsured against risk.\n\n\"A person's home is their largest asset, so going uninsured or underinsured is a big, big risk,\" he said.\n\n\"That becomes an issue for the government to think more carefully about the benefits of private insurance and how they can make it work better for these catastrophic events.\"\n\nTo combat rising premiums, the ICA is pushing for the federal government to invest in resilience measures, including a $30 billion flood defence fund.\n\nShirley McRae has dealt with two major floods since being priced out of flood insurance. (Supplied: Tracey Stevenson)\n\nFor Shirley McRae, being priced out of flood insurance coverage meant she faced an uncertain future.\n\n\"I'm 74 going on 75. I've just retired. Only six weeks ago, I was sitting on my back verandah thinking I own everything I've got,\" she said.\n\n\"If anything should happen to me now, the children will be fine. My funeral's paid for, and I'll be fine.\n\n\"Well, let me tell you. I had no idea that this was going to happen.\"",

(Supplied: Queensland Rail)\n\nThe state's rail operator has called time on the iconic fleet by allowing south-east train enthusiasts and commuters alike a chance to hop aboard for one final ride.\n\nThis 'End of the Line' tour will see EMUs run from Roma Street station along the Caboolture, Ipswich, Ferny Grove and Shorncliffe lines.\n\nThe tour will finish at Roma Street, with the last train leaving the station around 7pm.\n\nAfter four decades of service, the trains will take their last journey across the network this weekend. (Supplied: M Natoli)\n\nRob Hill, Executive General Manager of south-east Queensland Operations, said the introduction of the EMUs in 1979 was an important moment for the state.\n\n\"It really was that turning point into that electrified network \u2026 the stepping board for where public transport is today in Queensland,\" Mr Hill said.\n\n\"We've had significant overhauls on these trains over a period of time, but at a point in time they are no longer compliant with modern standards.\n\n\" It's now time for us to be able to recognise the significant contribution they've had, and also that connection with the community. \"\n\nThe retirement of EMU59 marks the end of an era in Queensland transport. (Supplied: Queensland Rail)\n\nA 'coming of age' for railways\n\nReef Thompson, from the Australian Railway Historical Society, said the electrification of rail in Queensland heralded a new era of travel.\n\n\"They were a coming of age for the railways \u2026 before the EMUs were delivered, there were no electric trains in Brisbane,\" Mr Thompson said.\n\nReef Thompson says the introduction of the EMUs was \"a coming of age\" for Queensland transport. (Supplied: Queensland Rail)\n\nMr Thompson said people may now want to do bespoke rides on the out-of-service fleet.\n\n\"There's never really been an appeal because everyone can go out and catch those EMUs every day,\" he said.\n\n\"Now there's none left it'll be a bit interesting seeing an EMU out-and-about.\"\n\nThe EMU train line to and from Ipswich was launched in 1980. (Supplied: Queensland Rail)\n\nDecades of change\n\nThere are eight different types of trains currently running on the Queensland Rail network \u2014 the EMU is the oldest of them all.\n\nThe newest of the fleet \u2014 the New Generation Rollingstock (NGR) \u2014 was unveiled by the Queensland Government in 2016.\n\nThose trains featured improvements in accessibility, more leg room and under-seat storage for passengers.\n\nThe electric EMUs are being phased out in favour of more modern models. (Supplied: Queensland Rail)\n\nSince 2018, Queensland Rail has progressively decommissioned the EMUs in favour of more modern fleets.\n\nThe decision to retire the EMUs came as Queensland Rail weighed up the cost of maintaining the older locomotives with that of introducing newer ones.\n\n\"We've got some newer technologies \u2026 better information, so they are a little bit more advanced,\" Mr Hill said.\n\n\"You've got to make those decisions around whether you continue to invest in the asset that can't be compliant, or whether you start to look at new equipment and getting it out there.\n\n\" It's like your new car compared to your Holden HQ back in the day. \"\n\nThirteen electric trains came into trial usage in July 1979. (Supplied: Queensland Rail)\n\nA 'transformative' upgrade\n\nQueensland Rail is also in the process of installing a new signalling system, which it says will deliver seamless and safe train travel.\n\nThe European Train Control System is an advanced signalling system which reports the position, direction and speed of each train on the network.\n\nThe rail operator says it will enable the system to calculate maximum running speeds.\n\nQueensland Rail is in the process of implementing a new rail signalling system. (Supplied: Queensland Rail)\n\nIt says it will allow trains to be scheduled to travel closer to each other while maintaining the highest standards of safety.\n\nReef Thompson said that is another reason why the EMUs have entered retirement.\n\n\"They're implementing that on various sectors of the network, and these older trains aren't compatible with it,\" he said.\n\n\"That's a major transformative project that they're doing, and it will allow them to run more trains,\" Mr Thompson said.",

    "text": "In what will be Australia\u2019s last Test outing before the Ashes, two more low scores could make a real dent in Konstas\u2019 confidence. Josh Hazlewood, who took 2-43 on day two, made his one-day international debutas a 19-year-old, so has walked in Konstas\u2019 shoes. Despite the youngster\u2019s lean run, Hazlewood is adamant he has the talent to succeed and is tracking in the right direction. Asked if he had advice for Konstas, Hazlewood said: \u201cYou\u2019re here for a reason. You\u2019re in this position because you\u2019re a good player. Every time I\u2019ve bowled to him in the last few months, he just keeps getting better and better. He\u2019s such a quick learner and absorbs everything. \u201cHe got thrown in a tough situation there. In the first innings, he played some really nice shots and put some pressure back on the bowlers. He\u2019s trending in the right direction. But yeah, it\u2019s tough at 19.\u201d\n\nEvery Australian cricket fan has an opinion on Konstas and his latest failure won\u2019t silence the critics. His performances, however, have taken some heat off Khawaja, who has been well below his reliable best. Since his 232 against Sri Lanka this year, Khawaja hasn\u2019t passed 50 in his past eight Test innings. One score above 90 in his past 42 Test innings is likely to be a serious talking point among selectors. It\u2019s also the manner of dismissals. Khawaja is regularly being trapped in front from right-arm bowlers coming around the wicket. Seales did it again, angling one in and trapping the left-hander on the crease. The review was futile as three red lights consigned Khawaja to his third single-digit score in the past month, despite his 47 in the first innings in Barbados.\n\nKhawaja wants to play in the Ashes and coach Andrew McDonald believes he can get there. But Sheffield Shield runs will be at a premium heading into the first Test in November, for this West Indies tour has not gone to plan for nearly all the country\u2019s top batsmen. England quicks will be licking their lips. The West Indies\u2019 fast bowlers have been magnificent. They studied the weaknesses of Australia\u2019s top order and have exploited those frailties with alarming regularity. Granted, the pitches in Barbados and Grenada have been difficult for batters on both teams. The thing working in Konstas and Khawaja\u2019s favour is that Australia is not carrying a spare opening batter in the Caribbean. The Steve Smith experiment won\u2019t happen again and Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s one-off promotion to the top for a World Test Championship final didn\u2019t work.\n\nIt will be a long wait for the pair before the third Test, starting next Saturday. Earlier, Pat Cummins produced one of the all-time caught and bowled dismissals before taking a crucial partnership-breaking wicket to help Australia roll the West Indies for 253. Hazlewood got the ball rolling for Australia, removing Kraigg Brathwaite for an eight-ball duck in the opener\u2019s 100th Test, in a sharp return catch to his left side. About six overs later, Cummins trumped Hazlewood\u2019s effort with his stunning caught and bowled.\n\nBowlers rarely take bat-pad catches because they never stand at short leg. As a fast-bowling captain, Cummins would be the last person to field in that position, but somehow he managed to take a remarkable bat-pad catch off his own bowling thanks to some brilliant athleticism. West Indies No.3 Keacy Carty pushed forward and got a thick inside edge that ballooned in the air. Some pacemen wouldn\u2019t get close to the catch or even attempt it, but Cummins saw the opportunity and sprinted at full tilt to give himself a chance. With an early dive and an outstretched right hand, about 12 metres away from the bowling crease, Cummins caught the ball just above the turf and made sure it didn\u2019t flick the grass.\n\n\u201cJust before he bowled it, I thought where\u2019s his bat pad because it\u2019s been in the game a lot,\u201d Hazlewood said. \u201cHell of a grab. He\u2019s taken some good ones over the years.\u201d When Beau Webster removed John Campbell for 40, the West Indies were in strife at 3-64 but recovered to 4-169 thanks to Brandon King\u2019s impressive half century. Just when the West Indies looked like registering a first-innings lead, Cummins bowled Shai Hope (21) with a sensational delivery that smashed into the off stump and ended a 58-run partnership. Cummins\u2019 father, Peter, has been enjoying himself in Barbados and Grenada. Sitting near Konstas\u2019 father, Cummins snr gave a double thumbs up to television cameras when the wicket unfolded.",

    "text": "The Wallabies have already secured a major victory when it comes to perception at scrum time \u2013 an area where they have been smashed by referees in the past. Scrum coach Mike Cron is so well regarded as a disciple of square, technically correct scrummaging that he has previously been employed by World Rugby as a consultant. The implication is that Cron\u2019s teams scrum properly \u2013 no mucking about or games. Given the Lions\u2019 scrum issues on the tour so far, the Wallabies have the chance to show against Fiji that they want it to be a contest and they want to back themselves, and that any issues during the Test series will be coming from the Lions. Taniela Tupou lost the refs in Super Rugby Pacific. They were never really convinced that his occasional dominance was above board, and we saw the Lions repeatedly penalised against the Reds for the same crime \u2013 the tighthead angling inwards. Angus Bell has to go forward in the No.1 jersey and plant that positive perception in the minds of the match officials.

Test the fringes\n\nPicking holes in this Lions team isn\u2019t easy \u2013 they have so many big and dynamic men. But with that in mind, it has been surprising to see some of their defence around the fringes of the ruck. That has been borderline lazy during the games against the Force and Reds. It is something for the Wallabies to explore. There have been a few occasions when the Lions forwards have been slow to get back into the defensive line around the ruck, and Wallabies halfback Tate McDermott\u2019s eyes must be lighting up. If there are opportunities for the Wallabies\u2019 big men to go to work in tight against Fiji, they need to take them. Finn Russell (R) and Sione Tuipulotu of the British & Irish Lions celebrate after their victory during the tour match between the Western Force and British & Irish Lions at the Optus Stadium Credit: Getty Images 4. Close down the space at No. 10 Lions No. 10 Finn Russell will cut most teams to shreds if given enough time and space. He punished the Reds when they became a bit passive in Brisbane on Wednesday. Teams in this part of the world are typically not big on the rush defence, but the Wallabies are either going to have to make a complete mess of the Lions\u2019 ruck or get off the line faster than normal to negate Russell.\n\nThe primary concern, by far, for the Wallabies is Lions halfback Jamison Gibson-Park getting quick ball to Russell to give him time to choose his runners \u2013 because those runners will be coming in numbers against the Wallabies. The Lions use No.13 Garry Ringrose as their line speed missile, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the No.13. The great Welsh side of a decade or so ago used No.12 Jamie Roberts as their way of putting pressure on the No.10, and the Wallabies have Len Ikitau - one of their best decision makers. 5. Breakdown control Loading The most disappointing performance on the Wallabies\u2019 end-of-season tour last year was the 27-13 loss to the Scots in Edinburgh because the visitors never really got their game going. Scotland caused a lot of issues at the breakdown, where they are particularly strong, and the Lions can deliver the same pain due to the number of scavengers they had selected in the back row. Super Rugby-quality carries and cleans won\u2019t cut it against the Lions: the Wallabies have to be aggressive and accurate here against the Fijians - or perhaps count their blessings that they have one Test to blow away some of the cobwebs.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nA former primary school teacher, Clarissa Valentine never planned to home-school her twin 12 year old boys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over Covid, a lot of things that were habitual and just part of life changed because we were locked down, and there were a lot of things that I then had never questioned that I started to question. And I am a primary school teacher, I love rules and boxes, and you do this and that. And then everything was kind of stripped back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Melbourne's lockdowns and vaccine mandates during the height of the COVID pandemic, prompted a lifestyle change, and a move to the Sunshine Coast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think moving here, starting again, with that mindset, I thought okay now's the time to, let's create an intentional life, and these are the things I'm going to put in that life. Nothing is perfect, and the education system is not perfect, but I think taking yourself out of it allows you to step back a little bit. Doing that caused me to see it wasn't ideal and I could do it differently.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nClarissa is among thousands of families across the country who transitioned to homeschooling from the onset of the pandemic - some 45,000 children registered for homeschooling in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Queensland in particular saw the highest spike in numbers, a trend that has continued years after the pandemic lockdowns.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland's Department of Education reports a 163% increase in homeschooling from 2020 to 2024, bringing the most recently updated number of homeschooling students in Queensland to more than 11,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Rebecca English, Senior lecturer in Education at Queensland's University of Technology, says the reasons for Queensland's dramatic uptick are unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not really sure why it's Queensland, but Queensland has a long history of quite a fractious relationship with state schooling. And that data seemed to suggest the same things we keep seeing in research that parents feel that the school is not the appropriate environment for that young person. I think when you look at the Brisbane area and the Sunshine Coast area and you look at other elements of maybe not going along with mainstream higher rates of non vaccination in around Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast. So maybe it's correlated with that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut many parents, like Sunshine Coast-based Clarissa, say parents are encouraged to make the switch thanks to a vibrant homeschooling community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that once the community starts to grow a little, then other people get more confidence to join that community. If you were at home homeschooling and you didn't really know anyone, it can be really isolating. And I think that would be really hard for the parent and for the children. But if you've got other groups of people that are homeschooling, there are park, there are so many things on the Sunshine Coast in particular that you could participate in that you could be busy all day every day. And I think that brings confidence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething parents find helpful, when the choice to homeschool is typically unplanned.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr English says around 85% of homeschooling students are school refusers, or those who found mainstream schooling didn't work for their child - while the other 15% are ideologically opposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So often there is a strong correlation between the choice of homeschooling and school can't or school refusal in Australia... and I think that's something we really need to look at, how can we better meet the needs of particularly neurodiverse children in our classrooms.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a year of trying mainstream schooling, Sunshine Coast residents Danika and Joel resorted to homeschooling their eight-year-old son Ben two years ago, after his school refusal and anxiety reached a tipping point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was four, turning five the year that he started prep. And for him to come home in tears saying school's not for me, just him being able to communicate and articulate, that was quite overwhelming for us as parents. We thought what's happening in the school grounds that's making him feel this way? But there was no particular incidents. He just didn't feel safe and secure mentally. And he was just this little 5 year old boy whose heart had been broken, spark had been put out... and it was not the school's fault, it was just the sheer volume of everything on such a little human being.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Queensland, parents who home-school do not have to adhere to the Australian curriculum.\n\n\n\nThe previous state government had sought to enforce it, sparking a campaign against the move.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Free2Homeschool campaign gathered more than 21,000 signatures and more than 2000 submissions opposing the former Queensland government's attempts to enforce the Australian curriculum on home-schoolers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisbane-based Patricia Fitzgerald is Campaign Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The freedom that we have now is a lot of why we choose homeschooling. So if we're going to take that away, our children may as well be in school. We put up a campaign to make sure that the government heard what we needed and understood us. So a lot of it was around educating them so that we could show that that level of restriction on us was not going to help educate our children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current Queensland government tabled new legislation in March 2025, still under review, which removed all the homeschooling reforms opposed to by stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland's Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek told SBS it's a parent's right to choose the type of education that suits their family, but safety must always be a priority - adding the government are working to implement all accepted recommendations of an independent review into home schooling.\n\n\n\nA separate 2024 review by the Queensland Family and Child Commission also called for better information-sharing between government departments to ensure child safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a random sample of 500 home schooled students, it found 35 children were considered to be living in a high risk home environment between August 2021 and August 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner Luke Twyford says there needs to be greater visibility of children registered in the home education system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So our review was very careful to try and not suggest that it is homeschooling parents that are at risk. That's absolutely not the case. What we are mostly concerned about is that the registration system in homeschooling isn't always picking up risk factors that other government departments are identifying.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts stressing the needs of the child must always come first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And we need to be responsive to that young person as well. So if they say, mum, dad, I really want to go back to school, or I really want to try school, then maybe we need to really look at the reasons for that young person saying they'd like to go to school.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile still acknowledging the importance of alternative learning, for children like Ben.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like normal school, I made it up to grade one and it was a bit hard for me. Some of the questions were a bit hard for me, but with homeschooling you get to solve so many things at your own pace. I am able to solve some pretty complex math questions now and I took my time.\"\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s all part of his broader purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReally important to pass down this knowledge to a younger generation, especially working in the food industry as there isn't much of a representation of First Nations chefs using First Nations food.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWatching on, 19-year-old apprentice Kaylee Rose Tsoumbris Davies\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018It makes me feel connected. It is just a really nice feeling to get to know something that I didn't know my whole life growing up, that was a big struggle for me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Mr Jordan, passing on knowledge is very personal. Growing up in Northern NSW, he learned little about his Aboriginal heritage or his connections to Kamilaroi country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSpeaking to my grandmother, they were told if anyone asks \u2018tell someone that you're Italian\u2019. And there was a lot of shame in the family. It is amazing in my lifetime to see that shift and my family, my extended family, um be proud of who they are.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily means a lot to Mr Jordan, who named his catering business in memory of his father Joseph \u2026 a refugee from former-Yugoslavia, who died when he was a baby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don't have any memories of him at all. And that's part of the reason why I named my business Three Little Birds was his favourite song by Bob Marley as a message of positivity in our family.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a stint in London, Mr Jordan returned to Australia in 2017, determined to learn about his heritage. And he found an Aboriginal mentor who changed his life forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe biggest part for me getting sober was meeting Auntie Dale. She has been in the bush food industry for 35 years now. She's an amazing chef, an amazing educator.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn at Dirranbandi (Deer-an-bandy) in south-west Queensland Aunty Dale Chapman is well known for cooking with native foods. She is pleased to have supported Mr Jordan\u2019s progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm extremely proud! He's taken Australian native ingredients to another level, and being able to share it with the young people is so important because they are ultimately our future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Mr Jordan, securing the future also means sourcing sustainable bush foods and supporting Indigenous growers. Australia\u2019s bush food industry is valued at more than 80 million dollars annually, according to Sydney University research. Yet few of the profits go back to Indigenous growers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLess than 3% of the Bush food industry is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander owned, and I think that really needs to shift. Making sure that the money goes back to community and we've collaborated with a lot of different restaurants and cafes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOne supplier is the Food Connect Shed in Brisbane -a community-owned hub focusing on sustainable food systems. Its CEO is Robert Pekin ( PRON Peekin).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cit's owned by 540 odd people. Most of them are locals. One of our big long-term objectives is we need to get First Nations food into our diets in a mainstream way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching respect for native ingredients and their traditional uses is also a growing focus at universities across the country. Dr Frances Wyld teaches Aboriginal Studies at the University of South Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are the foods that have sustained Aboriginal people for 60,000 years. They also require less care, such as more water, more pesticides, because they belong here, they grow here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s information that Mr Jordan shares in school classrooms and at cooking workshops in juvenile detention. He also supports young people who\u2019ve had contact with the justice system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA huge percentage of our First Nations youth are incarcerated. It\u2019s really important to have that connection to culture and have the opportunity for employment. For me personally, leaving home at a young age and going down a path where I ended up having to get sober and really clean my life up, introducing native ingredients really helped me. Yeah it\u2019s really, really powerful.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether showcasing bush foods to the public or teaching young trainees, for Mr Jordan it\u2019s about inspiring change beyond the plate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, passing it down through food and sharing my experience and how it saved my life, I think it's a really strong message.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "As a former primary school teacher, Clarissa Valentine never pictured homeschooling her twin 12-year-old boys. From when they were six years old, they had been enrolled at their local school in a leafy north-eastern suburb of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in March 2022, following multiple lockdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Valentine made the snap decision to move the family interstate to Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer boys Owen and Miles were nine at the time, and Valentine was craving a sea change.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe set her sights on the Sunshine Coast, with its relaxed, family-friendly lifestyle and pristine beaches \u2014 a far cry from Melbourne's rolling lockdowns and vaccine mandates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pausing and stopping, I saw that all those things that maybe I thought were important weren't important, and the most important thing was just our little family unit,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe twins had been remote learning in Melbourne from grade one for around two years, but Valentine decided then she would homeschool the twins.\n\n\n\nClarissa helps Miles with some schoolwork. Credit: SBS Valentine says she was also motivated by the vaccine mandate imposed in schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had some family members that worked at the school [on the Sunshine Coast] that I thought I'd put my kids in, and they lost their jobs because they wouldn't get immunised,\" Valentine recalls.\n\n\n\nIt just didn't feel right to then put my kids in that system.\n\nValentine is one of a growing number of parents in Queensland who are opting to homeschool their children \u2014 a trend that is outstripping rates in other Australian states and territories.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs daily habits and routines changed during the pandemic, Valentine says she reflected on her family lifestyle and decided the school system \"wasn't ideal\", and that she \"could do it differently\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nothing is perfect and the education system is not perfect, but I think taking yourself out of it allows you to step back a little bit and have a little bit of a look at the reality of what's happening,\" she says.\n\n\n\nGrowing trend towards homeschooling\n\nClarissa is among thousands of Australian parents who homeschooled their children during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020, and statistics show some have continued to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of children registered in home education nationally is estimated to be around 92 per cent higher in 2024 compared with 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data is based on home registration figures from state and territory home education departments, compiled by Vivienne Fox, president of the Sydney Home Education Network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows that Queensland has experienced the biggest rise in homeschooling across all states and territories, increasing by 163 per cent since 2020.\n\n\n\nQueensland has experienced the most significant increase of homeschooling students, rising by 163% from 2020. Credit: Supplied/Vivienne Fox Dr Rebecca English, a senior lecturer in education at Queensland University of Technology, says while homeschooling rates had been slowly increasing prior to COVID-19, numbers ballooned at the onset of the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt gave parents a deeper insight into classrooms via remote learning, which was imposed during periods of the pandemic. English says this led some to believe they are better equipped to educate their children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Parents looked at that and said, 'I'm already at home anyway, maybe I can do just as good of a job as the teacher is'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And they were seeing how that neurodiverse person, or that child who had reported they were bullied, was coping with that learning environment\".\n\n\n\nWhy has Queensland seen the biggest growth?\n\nEnglish says the reason behind Queensland's pronounced uptick in homeschooling rates is unclear, but that the state has a complex history with mainstream schooling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not really sure why it's Queensland, but Queensland has a long history of quite a fractious relationship with state schooling,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to English, lower vaccination rates and opposition to vaccine mandates in Queensland may also play a role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think [that's possible] when you look at the Brisbane area and the Sunshine Coast area and you look at other elements of maybe not going along with [the] mainstream, [and] higher rates of non-vaccination in [and] around Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast.\"\n\n\n\nDr Rebecca English is a senior lecturer in education at Queensland University of Technology. Credit: QUT/Anthony Weate Parents also attribute the popularity of homeschooling to its vibrant community mindset, particularly in the Sunshine Coast, which Valentine says encourages families to consider alternative education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that once the community starts to grow a little, then other people get more confidence to join that community,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are so many things on the Sunshine Coast in particular that you could participate in that you could be busy all day, every day\".\n\n\n\nThe 'school refusal' cohort\n\nDespite the potential motivations of parents, the primary driver for homeschooling in Australia comes from students.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish says that while around 10 or 15 per cent of people are \"ideologically opposed to schooling\", the main reason people opt for homeschooling is school refusal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is typically as a result of bullying, social anxiety or because a child is neurodivergent and unsuited to the mainstream school environment, English explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The increase in that 85 per cent [is] these accidental homeschoolers \u2014 they didn't set out to homeschool [but] they find that this is the only choice. That is where the real research interest lies,\" she says.\n\n\n\nEight-year-old Ben started homeschooling two years ago after experiencing school refusal. Credit: Danika / Supplied After a year of trying mainstream schooling, Sunshine Coast residents Danika and Joel resorted to homeschooling their eight-year-old son Ben, after his school refusal and anxiety reached a tipping point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Homeschooling sort of chose us,\" Danika says,\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was something that we as a family decided for Ben's mental health, [that it] was a better option to try homeschooling just because of how school was making him feel.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBen was experiencing \"a lot of separation anxiety\", and was arriving home in tears as he voiced to his parents daily that school wasn't for him. Danika says this initially \"derailed\" her and Joel, who had both had a positive school experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He just was this little five-year-old boy whose heart had been broken, spark had been put out and it was not the school's fault, it was just the sheer volume of everything on such a little human being,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And then we peeled back the layers, and the neurodiverse aspect in a mainstream school was quite overwhelming.\"\n\n\n\nDanika, Ben and Milly learning together at home. Credit: Supplied Ben has since been diagnosed with ADHD, which Danika says contributed to his school refusal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile she doesn't blame the school or teachers, she says public school resourcing isn't designed to support all children, especially those who are neurodivergent.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says Ben felt he was being punished for his \"neurodiverse idiosyncrasies\", which was \"quite shameful\" for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We thought: 'What's happening in the school grounds that's making him feel this way?' But there [were] no particular incidents. He just didn't feel safe and secure mentally\".\n\n\n\nShortcomings of mainstream schooling\n\nRemote learning during the peak of the pandemic caused many parents to question traditional schooling, according to Queensland Family and Child Commissioner Luke Twyford.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says increasing rates of homeschooling indicate parents are being \"very conscious of the wellbeing of their children\" and choosing homeschooling as a \"positive outcome\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there's a change in our society around questioning traditional schooling methods,\" Twyford says.\n\n\n\nI've certainly seen increases in adolescent mental health and 'school can't' and 'school refusal' movements.\n\nEnglish says it's important to reassess the psychosocial care limitations of state-based school systems, given the main driver of homeschooling results from school refusal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that's something that we really need to look at: How can we better meet the needs of particularly neurodiverse young people in our classrooms?\"\n\n\n\nCalls for more regulation in home schooling\n\nThe former Queensland government was unsuccessful in attempts to pass legislation last year that would enforce homeschooling parents to follow the Australian curriculum, among other reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was largely thanks to the Free2Homeschool movement, led by homeschooling parents, who gathered more than 21,000 signatures and more than 2,000 submissions in opposition to the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the freedom that we have now is a lot of why we choose homeschooling,\" campaign manager Patricia Fitzgerald tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, if we're going to take that away, our children may as well be in school, but we didn't want that\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current Queensland government introduced new legislation in March this year, which is still under review, removing clauses that homeschooling parents had objected to, such as enforcing the Australian curriculum and removing provisional registration options that parents argue allow for more flexibility to commence homeschooling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legislation does maintain a reform to change the eligibility age range for homeschool students, lifting the cut-off age from 17 to 18, which is a move that has been advocated for by homeschooling parents.\n\n\n\nPatricia Fitzgerald and Amanda Bartle started the Free2Homeschool campaign seeking to protect caregivers' ability to meet the specific education needs of homeschooled students. Credit: Patricia Fitzgerald Queensland's Family and Child Commission conducted a report last year into Queensland's home education system, in response to concerns raised by the Child Death Review Board in their 2022-2023 report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe December 2024 report into Queensland's home education system \"affirmed a parent's right to choose the most suitable learning environment for their child\", but called for improved information-sharing between state government departments to ensure child safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we are mostly concerned about is that the registration system in homeschooling isn't always picking up other risk factors that other government departments are identifying,\" Twyford says.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek told SBS News that the department is considering the findings of a separate independent home education review and \"will work with families, Child Safety, and other agencies to implement all accepted recommendations of the report\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a parent's right to choose the type of education that best suits their family, but safety must always be the priority,\" Langbroek says.\n\n\n\nChanging lifestyles and greater flexibility\n\nThe growing trend towards homeschooling also raises questions about the future structures of work, education and family life.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key changes could be a more tailored approach to education, says English.\n\n\n\nHomeschooling is much more child-centred and I would expect to see that schools will adopt more of that child-centred learning.\n\nValentine has seen the advantages of homeschooling firsthand and says she appreciates the time she shares with her two sons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It allows me to spend quality time with my kids every day, and I've really seen the benefits of that in terms of our closeness and our relationship, [which] is beautiful,\" she says.\n\n\n\nValentine says there are so many varying learning opportunities afforded by the flexibility of homeschooling. Credit: Supplied She says her family feels part of a \"bigger community\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a beautiful thing to be able to go out into the world and be able to talk to different people. Everywhere we go is a learning opportunity\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish says the rise in homeschooling has also coincided with greater numbers of people working from home since the start of the pandemic, which could offer greater flexibility for families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think homeschooling does offer parents an opportunity to balance that work, family life, school situation,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And homeschooling offers families the opportunity to spend more time with that young person.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Avoiding tax can almost seem like a national sport in Australia, but is it ever fair for our richest residents to pay no tax at all?\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) released data showing 91 people who reported a total income or loss of more than $1 million in 2022-23 paid no tax.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say there are legitimate reasons why high-income earners may be paying no tax, but it does raise questions around whether the system could be fairer \u2014 especially for those who don't have the same opportunities to benefit from tax deductions.\n\n\n\nWhy some people don't pay tax\n\nIndependent economist Saul Eslake says there could be several reasons why people earning substantial incomes are not paying tax.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, those who earn income generated overseas may have already paid tax in a foreign country. Australia has treaties with most countries, so residents don't pay double tax.\n\n\n\nOf the 91 individuals who paid no tax in 2022-23, at least 28 reported $14.8 million in foreign-source income.\n\n\n\n\n\nLottery wins in Australia are also not taxed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Personally, I think [lottery wins] should be subject to tax, but they're not,\" Eslake says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperannuation earnings in the draw-down or retirement phase are also not taxed, something that has been described by former federal treasury secretary Ken Henry as \"stupid\".\n\n\n\n'Unfair' system that disadvantages wage and salary earners\n\nAnn Kayis-Kumar, associate professor of accounting at UNSW Business School, says while tax planning is allowed in Australia and laws around deductions are relatively generous, they don't benefit everyone equally.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says business owners are much more likely to be able to claim deductions and reduce their tax to zero than Australians who are earning a wage or salary.\n\n\n\n\n\nA study by UNSW found high-income taxpayers were best able to mitigate their tax liability because they were more likely to have access to different business structures.\n\n\n\nFor someone [earning] salary and wages ... there aren't any sophisticated structures that we can use.\n\nGreg Jericho, chief economist at The Australia Institute, says wage earners often find it difficult to claim tax deductions for expenses such as work clothes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As soon as you're either a sole trader or small business, suddenly things become business expenses and you're able to claim them,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of carrying forward losses from previous years and things like that, which just doesn't happen for someone who is on an income.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ATO spokesperson says employees generally can't claim a deduction for conventional clothes and this also applies to business owners.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if a business purchases and provides conventional clothing for its owner or other employees for wear during their employment or provides them with an allowance for this, the business may be entitled to a deduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A business can claim a tax deduction for most expenses they incur in carrying on your business if they are directly related to earning your assessable income.\"\n\n\n\nBusiness owners are able to claim tax deductions easier than wage and salary earners. Source: Getty / Krisanapong Detraphiphat Eslake says income from capital gains, dividends, partnerships, trusts and superannuation funds is also taxed at lower rates than wages and salaries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 82 per cent of the income earned by those in lower tax brackets is gained through wages and salaries. This drops to just 58 per cent among those in the top tax bracket.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the 91 individuals who did not pay tax, just 18 reported $4.7 million in income earned from salary or wages.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut they reported $430.4 million in capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments such as property, shares and crypto assets.\n\n\n\nSomething that's fundamentally unfair about the tax system is that it does discriminate against wage and salary earners.\n\nEslake says the system also benefits people aged over 65 because they rely less on wages and salaries, although many receive a pension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's an awful lot of capital gains, dividends and partnership income that people over 65 earn, and they don't pay the same rate of tax as you would if you were earning it in wages and salaries, it's lower,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Personally, I think that's unfair between rich and poor, and it's also unfair between old and young.\"\n\n\n\nSalary and wages make up a small portion of the $52.4 million in income reported by 91 individuals who paid no tax in 2022-23. Source: SBS News\n\nThe worst offenders when it comes to tax avoidance\n\nWhile attention is often focused on high-income earners, Eslake says small businesses are believed to be the worst offenders when it comes to avoiding tax.\n\n\n\n\n\nEslake is part of an expert advisory panel run by the ATO, which has estimated the difference between the amount of tax collected in categories such as personal tax, company tax, and customs and excise duty, and what would be collected if there were full compliance with the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the ATO estimates small business discrepancies make up around 40 per cent of the tax gap, amounting to $17.7 billion of the $44.5 billion gap in 2021-22.\n\n\n\nThey don't put a lot of resources into making sure small businesses comply because there are so many of them.\n\nIn contrast, Eslake says the ATO invests significant resources in ensuring that high net worth individuals and companies are compliant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The tax office would know who those people are, they will have gone over their affairs with a pretty fine-tooth comb and if they're not paying tax, it would be for a good reason,\" he says.\n\n\n\nHigh-income earners better able to take advantage of tax deductions\n\nGifts or donations to charity make up a significant portion of the tax deductions claimed by the 91 individuals who paid no tax in 2022-23.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Jericho says one of the more interesting aspects of their deductions is how much the group is spending on managing their tax affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really highlights that the millionaires who avoid paying tax are spending a lot of money on fairly high-priced accountants and tax lawyers to find every loophole to enable them to get their taxable income below the tax-free threshold [of $18,200 a year].\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, the 91 individuals spent around $51,000 each on expenses such as accountancy fees and litigation costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group reported a total income of $461.8 million, but their deductions came to $390.3 million. One person claimed $8 million in dividend deductions alone.\n\n\n\nSome of the tax deductions claimed by 91 individuals in Australia who paid no tax in 2022-23. Source: SBS News But the results for this group are likely to differ this financial year, as they are set to lose a significant source of deductions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022-23, they claimed $63 million for the cost of managing their tax affairs, but the overwhelming majority of this money ($58 million) was for interest charged by the ATO for late payment of taxes and penalties.\n\n\n\nChanges announced by the Albanese government in 2023 mean the general interest charge (GIC) and shortfall interest charge (SIC) will no longer be tax-deductible from 1 July this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The change is designed to ensure that taxpayers who do the right thing and pay their tax in full and on time are not disadvantaged relative to those who do delay payment,\" an ATO spokesperson says.\n\n\n\n\n\nEslake supports the change and says there's no reason these interest charges should be tax-deductible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not an expense necessarily incurred in producing accessible income \u2014 like interest on a loan taken out to purchase an investment property or the cost of cleaning work clothes such as a uniform \u2014 and it is not a policy purpose, such as donations to registered charities \u2026 so it shouldn't be a tax deduction,\" he says.\n\n\n\n'National hobby' in Australia to avoid paying tax\n\nJericho says most millionaires do pay tax and most of them (24,164 individuals) even remained in the top tax bracket in 2022-23.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, 860,021 individuals in the highest tax bracket paid $106.4 billion in tax. This equates to 38 per cent of the total income tax collected, even though this group only makes up 5.3 per cent of taxpayers.\n\n\n\n\n\nJericho says many tax concessions, such as the capital gains tax discount and negative gearing, are viewed as legitimate and this encourages people to change their behaviour to avoid paying tax.\n\n\n\nIt almost seems sometimes that one of the national hobbies is trying to find ways to avoid tax.\n\nJericho says if some of these incentives were removed, there would be less pressure to increase taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing wealthy individuals avoid taxes can also erode people's faith in the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It] almost implicitly encourages people to try and think that avoiding tax is legitimate and a worthwhile thing to pursue, and we really should not be encouraging that kind of activity,\" Jericho says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We should have people feeling that paying taxes is a good thing because it delivers all our services.\"\n\n\n\nTaxes fund our roads, schools and other services Australians rely on. Source: AAP / Luke Costin Kayis-Kumar says Australia has an over-reliance on personal income tax and former treasury secretary Ken Henry has warned about the intergenerational unfairness of the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a really important conversation to be having about income inequality and wealth inequality, and how can we use tax policy and design to mitigate the effects rather than [tinker] on the sidelines,\" Kayis-Kumar says.\n\n\n\nWhat changes could be made?\n\nWhile some wealthy individuals may have legitimate reasons for paying no tax, Jericho says this raises the question of whether a minimum rate of taxation on total income \u2014 instead of taxable income \u2014 should be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\nLimiting the amount of money someone can claim as a deduction for managing tax affairs to around $3,000 might also help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would put a bit of a crimp on these people who are spending huge amounts of money on tax lawyers and tax accountants to avoid paying tax,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nA study led by Kayis-Kumar looked at capping deductions for managing tax affairs to $3,000 \u2014 something Labor proposed in 2019 \u2014 and found it could be effective in reducing the exploitation of tax professional services as a means of reducing tax for high-income earners.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a second study found the ability for individuals to direct deductions between personal and corporate income may dampen the effectiveness of such a change.\n\n\n\nKayis-Kumar says Australia's system makes it relatively easy to apply deductions across different income categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The top rate of personal income tax [47 per cent] is higher than the corporate income tax [30 per cent], so you've immediately got that incentive,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's more attractive to put income into pots where the tax rate's lower, and to put deductions into pots where the tax rate is higher.\"\n\n\n\nSupport needed for changes\n\nChanging the system is also difficult due to unintended consequences and knock-on effects, Kayis-Kumar says.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if Australia reduced the number of deductions available and lowered tax rates simultaneously, most people wouldn't get much of a refund at the end of the financial year.\n\n\n\nIn Australia, especially, we love our tax refund culture, so it's really hard to unpick all of that in a way that will get everyone on board.\n\nThese types of changes may also not solve the bigger problem, as high-income earners may still find ways to plan around the rules, particularly because there may still be differences in how business or overseas income is taxed.\n\n\n\n\n\nKayis-Kumar says it may be necessary to look more broadly at the taxation of other assets, rather than changes to income tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A broad-based land tax has been described as a really effective way to solve that puzzle around why we have this over-reliance on personal income tax.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taxing of super profits \u2014 for example, the above-normal profits of mining companies \u2014 could also be reviewed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEslake says reducing capital gains tax discounts, negative gearing and changing how trusts are taxed could be other ways to make the system fairer.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia could also tax capital, investments and business at a flat rate of around 25 to 30 per cent with no tax-free threshold.\n\n\n\n",

The rider with the most points from winning designated climbs.\n\nWhite: Best young rider (under 26) with the lowest overall time.\n\nThe tour's overall winner is the competitor with the lowest combined time across all 21 stages. Usually, they are an all-rounder \u2014 good at sprinting, climbing and time trials.\n\n\n\nWho are the favourites\n\nWhile some teams acknowledge they cannot win the overall title and will instead aim to win specific stages, elite teams are chasing the general classification (GC) win, which means achieving the shortest overall time.\n\n\n\nTour de France winner Slovenia's Tadej Pogacar, wearing the overall leader's yellow jersey (right), and second place Denmark's Jonas Vingegaard talk after last year's tour.

A new report by property group Domain has revealed that servicing a mortgage on a house is cheaper in 6 per cent of suburbs around the country. For units, it's almost 23 per cent. But in Perth, nearly 83 per cent of apartments are cheaper to buy than rent. And while that may be a win for buyers, it highlights the struggles for those in the rental market.",

Announcer says \"maybe Tadej will say one last thing\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers as this year's cycling stars roll out to waving crowds in the city of Lille ahead of the big race.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow in its 112th edition, the 2025 Tour de France will feature 184 riders who will traverse 3,338 kilometres over the next three weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nReigning champion Tadej Pogacar enters the Tour as the overwhelming favourite, fresh off dominating the Spring Classics with wins at the Tour of Flanders, Amstel Gold Race, and Liege-Bastogne-Liege.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Slovenian cyclist is thrilled to be considered the man to beat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah it's been great season, so far perfect. Going here to the Tour as one of the favourites, it's an honour. I'm pleased and I hope I can live up to the expectation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDenmark's Jonas Vingegaard is expected to be Pogocar's biggest competitor, and is determined to reclaim the crown after finishing over six minutes behind Pogacar at the Tour in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a years-long rivalry, with the pair both taking home two first and two second-place Tour de France finishes in the last four years.\n\n\n\n\n\n28-year-old Vingegaard, who won in 2022 and 2023, has had a difficult season, suffering a concussion during the Paris to Nice race in March.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after rebounding to take second place at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, Vingegaard says he's more than ready for this next challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A bit of a weird season so far for me, but it only gives me more motivation to do well here. And yeah we have a strong team, we're all ready for it, and we'll do everything we can.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the peloton roll-out in in Lille, to its finish on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, for the first time in five years, all 21 stages of this year\u2019s Tour de France will take place in France.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tour will begin with 10 flat and hilly stages before the cyclists travel into the mountains, winding through the volcanic landscapes of the Massif Central, then climbing grueling peaks in the Pyrenees and Alps before heading North towards Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Vingegaard known to be a fierce contender on mountain climbs, Pogocar expects to be up for a close race during these long ascents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's (Vingegaard) on the long climbs I think he\u2019s one of the best, if not the best. But he can also do great time trials, sometimes better than me, sometimes worse.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel from Belgium also remains a serious contender, having placed third in his Tour de France debut last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says while the two stars might be the expected frontrunners, he's not going to make it easy for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s logic when they (Pogacar and Vingegaard) won together the last four editions, so it means that they are of course top favourites for this year\u2019s edition again. But I think it would be unfair towards myself, towards the team, to say that I\u2019m not here to compete with them. So I\u2019m just here to try and compete against them - and try to make it harder for them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of 23 teams, each with eight riders, will participate in the 2025 edition of the Tour de France.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently retired Australian cycling legend Caleb Ewan spoke on the SBS Cycling Podcast with co-host Christophe Mallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nEwan says in the last few years, many of the top cyclists at the Tour have been some of the youngest, and whether their success will continue as they get older remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of really young guys are stepping straight up to the world tour, and flying straight away. So you have 20-, 21-, 22- year-olds winning Tour de France, so are they still going to be winning at 32, 33? I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong 10 Australian competitors in this year's Tour, Ben O\u2019Connor is expected to lead the charge for Australia's WorldTour team, after claiming 2nd place on last year\u2019s Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaden Groves, a 26-year-old Australian cyclist, will be making his Tour de France debut with the Belgian team, alongside cycling greats Mathieu van der Poel and Jasper Philipsen.\n\n\n\n\n\nEwan says Groves' varied skill will be an asset in the unprecedented climb up the Montmatre hill in Paris, which will be included in this year's Tour before it finishes with a sprint on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's going to make for a much more aggressive race. As a sprinter you would hate it. All the sprinters will be hating it. Maybe a guy like Kayden Groves who can climb and sprint, a guy like that could be welcoming it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the demanding end to the race will be matched by what's expected to be a chaotic opening sprint on day 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it starts with a sprint, I think there's less control in the bunch for a longer period of time. It might take three or four or five stages for there to be a bit more control in the bunch. Whereas when there's directly a hard stage, I think it's kind of a good thing for the tour, because a lot of guys are already tired after a few days, then the order kind of establishes itself. Whereas, I think the first day is going to be crazy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately after the Tour de France, the Tour de France Femmes begins its 9-day race.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can watch every stage of the Tour de France and Tour de France Femmes live and free on SBS on Demand.\n\n\n\n",

Devastated. It's like unless you are part of the football family, people probably won\u2019t get it, but it's like you knew him. And he was so young. Kids and just can't believe it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of Liverpool fans have turned out to pay their respects and honour Jota in Anfield, leaving cards and flowers in his memory.\n\n\n\n\n\nJota helped Liverpool win the Premier League last season and also won the F-A Cup and League Cup with the team.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Liverpool Football Club said they're devastated by the death of Jota and his brother.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Manager Jurgen Klopp says he's heartbroken.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn an Instagram post, he wrote: \"This is a moment where I struggle! There must be a bigger purpose! But I can\u2019t see it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Portuguese Football Federation has also paid tribute to the brothers, saying their deaths are an irreparable loss for Portuguese football.\n\n\n\n\n\nPedro Proen\u00e7a is the Portuguese Football Federation President.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd like to say that Portuguese football is absolutely devastated today. We're all in mourning; the (Portuguese) Football Federation, this generation of players, over everything surrounding Diogo today, and if I may, Andre too. Diogo was what we'd all like to be. He was a benchmark for Portuguese soccer. He was a talent of his generation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPortugal's Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro echoed similar sentiments, saying the deaths were \"unexpected and tragic\".\n\n\n\n\n\nJota, who yielded five major honours for his club and country was meant to return to Liverpool next week for the start of pre-season training.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highly skilled player was nicknamed 'Jota The Slotter' by his Liverpool fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The way he played football with a smile on his face all the time. He was the epitome of enjoying what you do. Every time he went out on the pitch he gave his all. You don't know these people personally, but when you do lose somebody in this fashion, it's devastating. It's going to affect everyone. It's like losing someone really, really close to you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2021 interview with BBC Sport, he spoke about paying to play football when he was 16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's hard because firstly I wasn't paying, my parents were. That was I remember the hardest thing for me because I could see their struggle to get the money in the club and I think that caused me the debt that I could never pay them back. Obviously I try to do that and I just remember that was one of my things to keep going and to never give up because I trusted myself but obviously back then I never thought that this was possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHis career began at Gondomar, which is a small club in the Portuguese city of Porto.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnselmo Serra is the Gondomar SC Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He never forgot his roots, nor his friends, because he had a group of friends who were with him in the training here in Gondomar and who he even invited from time to time to go and watch Liverpool games in England. And they were like a group of friends that he never forgot over the years and that, therefore, proves the humility of the person that he is (was).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJota had previously played for Pacos de Ferreira, Atletico Madrid, Porto and Wolves - before joining Liverpool in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis final match was for Portugal in their UEFA Nations League final win against Spain on the 8th of June, winning 5-3 on penalties after a 2-2 draw in regular and extra time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a social media post, Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo said Jota's death \"doesn't make sense\", as he goes on to send his condolences to Jota's family.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2021 BBC Sport interview, this was Jota's advice to 16-year-old's potentially wanting to be a professional like him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mainly not to give up, I think even when we are - like I was playing in very low divisions, not just me they can find loads of examples is always possible to reach the top I think, and never give up is the main idea.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Liverpool player. and now football analyst for Sky Sports. Jamie Carragher says off the pitch, Jota was known as someone with a great sense of humility, and revered as a family man.\n\n\n\n",

He calls it, with habitual nerdiness, the \u201cregret-minimisation framework\u201d. In 1994, it led him to forsake cushy work at a hedge fund to start Amazon. It is behind the big bets, from the Prime subscription service to AWS cloud computing, that have made the company into a technology titan valued at $US2.3 trillion ($3.5 trillion) and himself into one of the world\u2019s richest people.\n\nIt also explains why, six years ago, Mr Bezos left his first wife of 25 years for a former TV presenter, Lauren S\u00e1nchez. And why he blew, on some estimates, $US50 million ($76 million) to rent out Venice for three days for their opulent nuptials starting on June 26 \u2013 the predictable antiplutocrat pushback be damned.\n\nNewlyweds Lauren S\u00e1nchez Bezos and Jeff Bezos are pictured here in Venice on their wedding weekend. Credit: AP\n\nThe 61-year-old Mr Bezos presumably has an even better idea today of what his octogenarian self might regret than he did at 31, 41 or 51, when his 80th birthday was far off. To get an inkling of his current calculus, look at how he spends, first, his time and, second, his $US240 billion ($365 billion) fortune.\n\nOnce the billionaire is back from his honeymoon, details of which are as hush-hush as the wedding was loud, he will return to his other love \u2013 Blue Origin.

    "text": "In what will be Australia\u2019s last Test outing before the Ashes, two more low scores could make a real dent in Konstas\u2019 confidence. Josh Hazlewood, who took 2-43 on day two, made his one-day international debutas a 19-year-old, so has walked in Konstas\u2019 shoes. Despite the youngster\u2019s lean run, Hazlewood is adamant he has the talent to succeed and is tracking in the right direction. Asked if he had advice for Konstas, Hazlewood said: \u201cYou\u2019re here for a reason. You\u2019re in this position because you\u2019re a good player. Every time I\u2019ve bowled to him in the last few months, he just keeps getting better and better. He\u2019s such a quick learner and absorbs everything. \u201cHe got thrown in a tough situation there. In the first innings, he played some really nice shots and put some pressure back on the bowlers. He\u2019s trending in the right direction. But yeah, it\u2019s tough at 19.\u201d\n\nEvery Australian cricket fan has an opinion on Konstas and his latest failure won\u2019t silence the critics. His performances, however, have taken some heat off Khawaja, who has been well below his reliable best. Since his 232 against Sri Lanka this year, Khawaja hasn\u2019t passed 50 in his past eight Test innings. One score above 90 in his past 42 Test innings is likely to be a serious talking point among selectors. It\u2019s also the manner of dismissals. Khawaja is regularly being trapped in front from right-arm bowlers coming around the wicket. Seales did it again, angling one in and trapping the left-hander on the crease. The review was futile as three red lights consigned Khawaja to his third single-digit score in the past month, despite his 47 in the first innings in Barbados.\n\nKhawaja wants to play in the Ashes and coach Andrew McDonald believes he can get there. But Sheffield Shield runs will be at a premium heading into the first Test in November, for this West Indies tour has not gone to plan for nearly all the country\u2019s top batsmen. England quicks will be licking their lips. The West Indies\u2019 fast bowlers have been magnificent. They studied the weaknesses of Australia\u2019s top order and have exploited those frailties with alarming regularity. Granted, the pitches in Barbados and Grenada have been difficult for batters on both teams. The thing working in Konstas and Khawaja\u2019s favour is that Australia is not carrying a spare opening batter in the Caribbean. The Steve Smith experiment won\u2019t happen again and Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s one-off promotion to the top for a World Test Championship final didn\u2019t work.\n\nIt will be a long wait for the pair before the third Test, starting next Saturday. Earlier, Pat Cummins produced one of the all-time caught and bowled dismissals before taking a crucial partnership-breaking wicket to help Australia roll the West Indies for 253. Hazlewood got the ball rolling for Australia, removing Kraigg Brathwaite for an eight-ball duck in the opener\u2019s 100th Test, in a sharp return catch to his left side. About six overs later, Cummins trumped Hazlewood\u2019s effort with his stunning caught and bowled.\n\nBowlers rarely take bat-pad catches because they never stand at short leg. As a fast-bowling captain, Cummins would be the last person to field in that position, but somehow he managed to take a remarkable bat-pad catch off his own bowling thanks to some brilliant athleticism. West Indies No.3 Keacy Carty pushed forward and got a thick inside edge that ballooned in the air. Some pacemen wouldn\u2019t get close to the catch or even attempt it, but Cummins saw the opportunity and sprinted at full tilt to give himself a chance. With an early dive and an outstretched right hand, about 12 metres away from the bowling crease, Cummins caught the ball just above the turf and made sure it didn\u2019t flick the grass.\n\n\u201cJust before he bowled it, I thought where\u2019s his bat pad because it\u2019s been in the game a lot,\u201d Hazlewood said. \u201cHell of a grab. He\u2019s taken some good ones over the years.\u201d When Beau Webster removed John Campbell for 40, the West Indies were in strife at 3-64 but recovered to 4-169 thanks to Brandon King\u2019s impressive half century. Just when the West Indies looked like registering a first-innings lead, Cummins bowled Shai Hope (21) with a sensational delivery that smashed into the off stump and ended a 58-run partnership. Cummins\u2019 father, Peter, has been enjoying himself in Barbados and Grenada. Sitting near Konstas\u2019 father, Cummins snr gave a double thumbs up to television cameras when the wicket unfolded.",

    "text": "The Wallabies have already secured a major victory when it comes to perception at scrum time \u2013 an area where they have been smashed by referees in the past. Scrum coach Mike Cron is so well regarded as a disciple of square, technically correct scrummaging that he has previously been employed by World Rugby as a consultant. The implication is that Cron\u2019s teams scrum properly \u2013 no mucking about or games. Given the Lions\u2019 scrum issues on the tour so far, the Wallabies have the chance to show against Fiji that they want it to be a contest and they want to back themselves, and that any issues during the Test series will be coming from the Lions. Taniela Tupou lost the refs in Super Rugby Pacific. They were never really convinced that his occasional dominance was above board, and we saw the Lions repeatedly penalised against the Reds for the same crime \u2013 the tighthead angling inwards. Angus Bell has to go forward in the No.1 jersey and plant that positive perception in the minds of the match officials. Taniela Tupou at a Waratahs training session in Sydney, with scrum coach Mike Cron and Angus Bell. Credit: Rugby Australia 3. Test the fringes\n\nPicking holes in this Lions team isn\u2019t easy \u2013 they have so many big and dynamic men. But with that in mind, it has been surprising to see some of their defence around the fringes of the ruck. That has been borderline lazy during the games against the Force and Reds. It is something for the Wallabies to explore. There have been a few occasions when the Lions forwards have been slow to get back into the defensive line around the ruck, and Wallabies halfback Tate McDermott\u2019s eyes must be lighting up. If there are opportunities for the Wallabies\u2019 big men to go to work in tight against Fiji, they need to take them. Finn Russell (R) and Sione Tuipulotu of the British & Irish Lions celebrate after their victory during the tour match between the Western Force and British & Irish Lions at the Optus Stadium Credit: Getty Images 4. Close down the space at No. 10 Lions No. 10 Finn Russell will cut most teams to shreds if given enough time and space. He punished the Reds when they became a bit passive in Brisbane on Wednesday. Teams in this part of the world are typically not big on the rush defence, but the Wallabies are either going to have to make a complete mess of the Lions\u2019 ruck or get off the line faster than normal to negate Russell.\n\nThe primary concern, by far, for the Wallabies is Lions halfback Jamison Gibson-Park getting quick ball to Russell to give him time to choose his runners \u2013 because those runners will be coming in numbers against the Wallabies. The Lions use No.13 Garry Ringrose as their line speed missile, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the No.13. The great Welsh side of a decade or so ago used No.12 Jamie Roberts as their way of putting pressure on the No.10, and the Wallabies have Len Ikitau - one of their best decision makers. 5. Breakdown control Loading The most disappointing performance on the Wallabies\u2019 end-of-season tour last year was the 27-13 loss to the Scots in Edinburgh because the visitors never really got their game going. Scotland caused a lot of issues at the breakdown, where they are particularly strong, and the Lions can deliver the same pain due to the number of scavengers they had selected in the back row. Super Rugby-quality carries and cleans won\u2019t cut it against the Lions: the Wallabies have to be aggressive and accurate here against the Fijians - or perhaps count their blessings that they have one Test to blow away some of the cobwebs.",

    "text": "\n\n\n\nA new strain of Covid is rapidly spreading across the world and has been found in the UK - becoming dominant in weeks - with experts saying it is evading immunity. The Covid strain, formally known as XFG and nicknamed Stratus, is said to have one unique symptom that helps identify which variant you have.\n\nStratus cases have boomed in just one month, thanks to its ability to infect people who have previously had Covid and those who had injections. Data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), shows Stratus has now become the dominant Covid strain in England.\n\nIn May 10 per cent of cases were Stratus, by the middle of June that was 40 per cent. There are two variants of Stratus circulating - XFG and XFG.3.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Girl, 11, in hospital after being hit by car on way home from school\n\nREAD MORE: Common vitamin supplement warning as '100 hospitalised' in Spain\n\nDr Kaywaan Khan, Harley Street GP and Founder of Hannah London Clinic, told Cosmopolitan UK: \u201cUnlike other variants, Stratus has certain mutations in the spike protein which could help it evade antibodies developed from prior infections or vaccinations.\"\n\nDr Khan said Stratus does not appear to people 'more ill' than previous strains. But he said there is one unique symptom, adding: \"One of the most noticeable symptoms of the Stratus variant is hoarseness, which includes a scratchy or raspy voice.\" Dr Khan said in general, the symptoms of Stratus tend to be 'mild to moderate'.\n\nDr Khan said: \"If you test positive, Stratus is highly contagious, and it is advised to stay home and isolate to avoid spreading to others.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProfessor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University, told MailOnline: \"The increased competitiveness of XFG and XFG.3 is likely due to new spike mutations which make these variants more able to evade the immune response. Given that immunity to Covid is waning in the population due to a decline in uptake of the spring booster jab and the reduction of Covid infections in recent months, more people will be susceptible to infection with XFG and XFG.3.\n\n\"This could lead to a new wave of infection but it\u2019s difficult to predict the extent of this wave.\"\n\nThe World Health Organisation has designated Stratis a 'variant under monitoring', meaning it is keeping a close eye on the spread of the strain. It accounts for 22 per cent of all cases around the world.\n\nThe spread of Stratus follows quickly on the back of another strain - Nimbus - which was reported to give people a very sore throat. That now accounts for 17 per cent of all tested cases in the UK.\n\nDr Michael Gregory, regional medical Director for NHS England said: \"The variant looks to be spreading rapidly within communities, with top symptoms being a 'razor blade' sore throat and swollen neck glands.\"",

    "text": "ITV viewers have accused The Chase of fixing the results after expert Jenny Ryan won with an \u201cincorrect\u201d answer.\n\nThe game show, hosted by Bradley Walsh, aired a repeat episode earlier this week, in which a team of contestants almost beat quizzing professional Ryan.\n\nIn the \u201cFinal Chase\u201d round, contestants Laura and Nick answered an impressive 14 questions correctly, which put Ryan in a tough spot as she needed to improve on that number to prevent the duo from winning the jackpot of \u00a33,000.\n\nRyan ultimately won the competition by a single question. One of her answers, however, has led to a furore online with fans protesting its accuracy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt one stage, Walsh asked Ryan: \u201cWhat colour indicates semi-skimmed milk on bottles?\u201d After a brief hesitation, the quizzer replied \u201cred and silver\u201d, which Walsh said he would \u201caccept\u201d as the answer.\n\nViewers were left astounded by the development, and were quick to point out that the colour commonly associated with semi-skimmed milk cartons is green.\n\n\u201cAm I going mad? I\u2019m sure the question was about the colour of tops on semi-skimmed milk,\u201d one person wrote on X, with another asking: \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d\n\nThe topic sparked a heated conversation on social media, with someone else writing: \u201cExcuse me? Semi-skimmed is GREEN!\u201d\n\nIt is, however, worth noting that Ryan was most likely basing her answer on the glass bottles delivered by milkmen as opposed to the cartons you buy in shops. The traditional glass bottles featured a red and silver cap as opposed to a green lid.\n\nThe Chase\u2019 star Jenny Ryan at centre of ITV quiz show controversy (ITV)\n\nRyan first appeared as an expert on The Chase in September 2015 after she was recommended to producers by fellow star Anne Hegarty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe other Chasers featured on the series, which launched in 2009, include Mark Labbett, Shaun Wallace, Paul Sinha, Darragh Ennis, and Shaun Wallace.\n\nShaun Wallace recently revealed how much he earns from the game show compared to what he makes from his day job as a barrister.\n\nWallace, who won Mastermind in 2004, said that his takings from The Chase are in the \u201csix-zero territory\u201d, adding that that he earns 10 times the amount he was making before signing up to the ITV series.\n\nDespite this hefty sum, he continues his work as a barrister to supplement his earnings, with The Chase comprising 70 per cent of his income and \u201cthe legal side\u201d of his career covering 30 per cent.",

    "text": "As Wimbledon takes centre stage once again, legendary player and commentator John McEnroe is back in the public eye. But off the court, the tennis icon has lived a very different kind of high-pressure life as a father of five navigating fame, divorce and parenting under scrutiny.\n\nHis daughter Emily, 34, has previously spoken about what it was really like growing up as the child of John and Oscar-winning actress Tatum O\u2019Neal.\n\nYou may also like\n\nLife between two homes\n\nJohn McEnroe and his daughter Anna McEnroe at a basketball game (Getty)\n\nJohn and Tatum married in 1986 and went on to have three children together: Kevin, 39, Sean, 38, and Emily. The marriage ended in divorce in 1994, with John later gaining custody of the children.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEmily has described her childhood as both privileged and painful. While she recognises the material advantages of growing up in Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, she admits: \"All the money in the world doesn\u2019t matter if you are sitting in a mansion being unhappy.\"\n\nHer parents\u2019 volatile relationship, alongside Tatum\u2019s battle with addiction, meant Emily spent much of her early life between homes. She lived primarily with her father and stepmother, singer Patty Smyth, seeing Tatum on weekends.\n\n'We've had our fights'\n\n\n\nEmily McEnroe posts pictures with her family on Instagram (Instagram)\n\nEmily describes a loud and lively household: \"You had to be loud to be noticed.\" She says the McEnroe household was full of personality, with siblings including Kevin and Sean, and later Anna, 29, and Ava, 26, from John\u2019s second marriage.\n\nDespite the chaos, Emily insists there was always love. \"We\u2019ve had our fights like all families, but we\u2019re there for each other.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJohn\u2019s style as a father was hands-on. Emily says he regularly made breakfast and drove her to school, despite a demanding schedule: \"He did that week in, week out, no matter how busy his life was.\"\n\nActress Tatum O'Neal and her children Emily, Kevin and Sean McEnroe arrive at the 30th anniversary screening of \"Paper Moon\" at the Vista Theater August 21, 2003 in Los Angeles, California (Getty Images)\n\nEmily also spoke about the pressures of having two famous parents. She enjoyed playing tennis at school but gave it up after being teased. Her classmates expected her to be brilliant because of her dad. Years later, John revealed she had been his most naturally talented child at the sport.\n\nShe also held back from acting for fear of comparison with her mother, who won an Oscar at age ten. But Emily eventually followed her own path and has since worked in voiceover, TV and film. She also co-hosts a podcast with Tatum called Tatum Verbatim.\n\nAddiction and reconciliation\n\nAva McEnroe is John's youngest (Getty)\n\nEmily has been open about the emotional impact of her mother\u2019s addiction. When Tatum was arrested in 2008 for drug possession, Emily was bombarded with messages while at school. \"People read about a scandal but forget it\u2019s about real people with real feelings.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nToday, Tatum is clean and the pair are close. Emily says: \"Even when Mum had problems, she was always there for me. Sometimes she feels more like my big sister than my mum.\"\n\nTatum, now 61, has moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her daughter and is supportive of her acting ambitions. \"Having a daughter and the bond we share is one of the great joys of my life,\" she told The Mail on Sunday.\n\nThe wider McEnroe family\n\nJohn McEnroe and Patty Smyth attend Apollo in the Hamptons 2016 (Getty)\n\nJohn McEnroe\u2019s children have largely stayed out of the spotlight. Kevin is now a published author, drawing on personal experience and family history for his novel Our Town.\n\nSean married quietly in 2021 and has spoken about struggling with trauma from his childhood. He credits his wife with helping him through a personal breakdown.\n\nJohn\u2019s youngest daughters, Anna and Ava, are also carving out impressive paths. Anna has worked in law after graduating from Fordham University, while Ava, who also studied law, has shared the stage with her father at public events.\n\nA famous legacy\n\nJohn McEnroe won the Men's Singles Final match at Wimbledon in 1984 (Getty)\n\nJohn, now 66, remains a prominent figure during the Wimbledon fortnight, with regular appearances in the BBC commentary box alongside legends like Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile his fiery court persona is long behind him, the emotional complexity of his family life continues to resonate with fans. Emily\u2019s honesty about growing up in the McEnroe household offers a rare glimpse behind the headlines.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been in the shadows,\" she says, \"but now I want to do something myself. One thing Dad always drummed into me was discipline.\"\n\nAs Emily steps into the spotlight on her own terms, it\u2019s clear she does so with the same determination that made her father a champion, and her mother a survivor.",

We were able to record our progress on our smart watches and then integrate this into the Slimming World App, resulting in us both getting our Body Magic Platinum Awards.\n\n\"We also participated in a 10k Cancer Research Walk in Birmingham.\u201d\n\nKaren has trained as a Consultant for Slimming World at their national training academy in Derbyshire.\n\nMembers at the Brandhall group in Oldbury are getting ready to welcome Karen as their new Consultant when she takes over the group on Thursday, July 17.\n\nKaren added: \u201cMy medication for high blood pressure has now been halved but even more amazingly I was previously injecting growth hormone daily; but as a direct result of the weight loss, that has now been completely stopped, and I\u2019ve never felt better!\n\n\"I have gone from a size 16/18 (bordering 20) to a size 6 to 8 and Martin has gone from a 5XL to L. Our lives have changed totally, our focus is completely on healthy food, we don\u2019t miss out, we eat well.\n\n\"We just make healthier choices, through Slimming World, eating out (planning in advance), picnics at National Trusts and parties with family.\u201d\n\nMartin has also eradicated his varicose eczema in both lower legs and avoided going on statins as a direct result of the weight loss.",

(PA Images/Alamy)\n\nThis is the astonishing moment Liam and Noel Gallagher finally reunited on stage at Cardiff's Principality Stadium to perform an Oasis gig for the first time in almost 16 years.\n\nIt was a moment that had been unthinkable for quite some time after Oasis famously split following a backstage row in Paris in 2009. The row sparked a fierce feud that saw the Gallagher brothers hurl insults at each other publicly over the years, but last summer they announced they were finally getting back together.\n\nOpening the Oasis Live '25 tour on Friday, the brothers put on a united performance at the Welsh capital\u2019s 74,500 capacity Principality Stadium, where they will also perform on Saturday.\n\nFittingly, their first track was 1995's Hello, with the crowd going wild as Liam yelled: \"It's been too long!\"\n\nOasis on stage at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff. (PA Images/Alamy)\n\nThe show had been a long time coming for Oasis fans. The Gallaghers initially started the rock band in Manchester in 1991 and they rocketed to fame with the release of their debut album Definitely Maybe in August 1994.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTheir hit songs included Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger, Champagne Supernova, Wonderwall and Live Forever.\n\nLiam Gallagher and his brother Noel started with the song Hello. (PA Images/Alamy)\n\nThey both pursued their own music after their break up, but fans had long wanted them to reunite and all eyes were on the show in Wales.\n\nExcitement was high ahead of the gig, with superfans queuing overnight. And Oasis was spelt out in a drone display over the stadium earlier in the week.\n\nAhead of the reunion gig, Noel - who was spotted arriving in Cardiff on the train - told talkSPORT radio: \"It's sounding huge... This is it, there's no going back now.\"\n\nThe siblings treated the Cardiff crowd to a string of their hits. (PA Images/Alamy)\n\nBefore Noel and Liam hit the stage on Friday, The Verve's Richard Ashcroft performed in a supporting slot.\n\nHe revved up the crowd by chanting: \"OASIS.\" \u201cSo glad to be here with the greatest rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band,\u201d he said.\n\nSome fans queued overnight ahead of the gig at the Principality Stadium. (Getty Images)\n\nRead more: The best and worst band reunions, from Pulp to Led Zeppelin\n\nWhat is the Oasis setlist?\n\nThere had been much speculation about the setlist, with Oasis\u2019 biggest hits expected but plenty of debate about what else they would play. As excitement mounted, fans reported hearing strains of specific songs from inside rehearsals.\n\nThe brothers started the rock band in 1991. (WireImage)\n\nOnce they stepped out it was clear the night would be a walk through their greatest hits, with many favourites played.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere had been rumours about Acquiesce being their opening track, but in the end they went with Hello, with Acquiesce the second song they performed. From there, the siblings moved through several crowd-pleasers and big hits, including Morning Glory, Some Might Say and Bring It On Down.\n\nThey got the audience dancing during Cigarettes & Alcohol, before treating the enthralled fans to songs such as Fade Away, Supersonic and Roll With It.\n\nNoel Gallagher and Liam Gallagher feuded for years. (PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nNoel then performed a segment alone, with tracks like Talk Tonight, Half The World Away and Little By Little. When his brother returned to his side after a brief break, the duo launched into D\u2019You Know What I Mean?, Stand By Me and then Cast No Shadow and Slide Away.\n\nOther hits included Whatever, Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Star and Live Forever, during which a picture of late footballer Diogo Jota appeared on the screen. The Liverpool player and his brother died in a car accident in Spain this week. Jota, who was 28, had married his partner just 11 days before he died.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the show started nearing its end, Liam and Noel performed The Masterplan and Don\u2019t Look Back In Anger. They ended with Wonderwall, which reached number two in the UK in 1995, and Champagne Supernova.\n\nThe Gallaghers ended with Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova. (PA Images/Alamy)\n\nFormer Oasis band members Gem Archer, Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs and Andy Bell joined the brothers on stage during the show, along with drummer Joey Waronker, who has previously toured with Liam.\n\nOasis announced reunion last year\n\nOasis' last performance together before Cardiff was at V Festival in 2009, the same year that they fell out. Since then fans had been calling for a reunion.\n\nRumours of a comeback started swirling again in 2024 then in August that year, Liam and Noel confirmed that it was finally happening.\n\nThe comeback gigs are not being televised. (PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nThey posted on social media: \"The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned. The great wait is over. Come see.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey also made it clear that the gigs weren't being televised. However, Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight is turning the reunion tour into a movie.\n\nAfter Cardiff, Oasis will hit the road for tour dates at Manchester\u2019s Heaton Park, London\u2019s Wembley Stadium, Edinburgh\u2019s Murrayfield Stadium and Dublin\u2019s Croke Park. These will cover off July, August and September.\n\nThen the band will take to the sky to perform in countries all over the world from Japan, South Korea, South America and Australia to North America.",

    "text": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s new party is not something Starmer \u2013 or Farage \u2013 can afford to ignore\n\nFor a beleaguered Keir Starmer, his former boss Jeremy Corbyn is turning into the political equivalent of one of those movie villains who simply refuses to be defeated.\n\nDespite being effectively thrown out of the party, Corbyn managed to get re-elected last year as an independent in the neighbouring seat to Starmer in north London.\n\nBut now his plan to create a new party on the left with another Labour exile, Zarah Sultana, looks like it could be more than just a chaotic vanity project.\n\nJeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana join a picket line (PA)\n\nEssentially, Corbyn and Sultana would be uniting a new political force which emerged during the 2024 election and was roughly known as the pro-Gaza independents.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApart from Corbyn himself, four of the pro-Gaza Independents were elected in 2024 and many more came very close, tapping into support in seats with high Muslim populations.\n\nFrontbencher Jon Ashworth, who looked as though he was destined for the cabinet, lost his Leicester South seat, while health secretary Wes Streeting only survived a challenge from one of these independents in Ilford North with a majority of 528.\n\nOthers to squeak through were justice secretary Shabana Mahmood and home office minister Jess Phillips.\n\nBut more to the point, Labour is no longer polling at 33 per cent - the national share of the vote they got to win the last election - but 10 points below that.\n\nSultana, Corbyn and the Gaza Independents are still very much motivated by Israel and the Middle East but also have a renewed domestic socialist agenda on the welfare cuts Starmer has proposed, and the desire to bring in wealth taxes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs we saw in the massive rebellion earlier this week on welfare, there is a lot of sympathy for this position in the Labour ranks and if rebels are to lose the whip or be turfed out of the party, then Corbyn and Sultana may give them a welcome home.\n\nPolling has suggested it would get 8 per cent national support as a start, more than enough to start eating into Labour majorities and splitting the vote on the left.\n\nPerhaps the only person who will be laughing will be Nigel Farage whose hopes of winning a majority with Reform UK can only be helped by a split leftwing vote.\n\nThat said, it could also be bad news for Farage. Reform has relied heavily on the so-called \u201canti-politics vote\u201d, the people unhappy with the mainstream parties looking for an alternative.\n\nCorbyn has always appealed to many in this group as much as Farage and they could end up fishing for support in the same pool even if their policies are miles apart.",

You are also often required to do the same training drills including running.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn how Emma's acting experience and the confidence gained could help in her new role, Kate adds: \"You have to strike a balance of being likeable and in control, so that the rowers are motivated but not messing out.\"\n\nEmma needs to be likeable as a cox (Getty)\n\nOlivia Deslandes, who rowed for her school as a teenager, adds: \"As a cox, although you are often the shortest person in the boat, you have to show complete confidence on and off the water. When the rowers are tired in a race and their body wants to give up, you are the voice in their ear telling them that they can and will do this. You have to help them override the pain.\"\n\nAs for Emma's training regime, Olivia notes: \"From my knowledge of university rowing, it is a huge commitment. Whilst I was a cox, we were on the river a minimum of three times a week and I believe university rowers are double that, with a lot of early morning sessions.\n\n\"Rowing is not easy but there is no thrill or sense of achievement like it.\"\n\nHere's hoping that, amid studying for her PhD, spending time with friends, and her new role as a cox, Emma is able to find some space to relax this summer!",

    "text": "Parliament's master bellringer has been hit with a \u00a3100,000-plus court bill after tearing out the front gates of his banker neighbour's \u00a32m west London home during a neighbours' fight.\n\nRetired financier Nicholas Partick-Hiley bought his mews cottage in Disbrowe Road, Fulham, in August 2023, planning to make the property a dream home for his retirement alongside wife, Lisa.\n\nBut the 64-year-old was shocked when he arrived on the day of completion to find his new neighbour - Parliament bellringer Adrian Udal, 65, - demolishing the door and roller gate securing the front of his home.\n\nMr Udal insisted he had a right to do what he did as he owns the land the gate was on, but the couple sued and won the case last month after Judge Nicholas Parfitt branded Mr Udal's actions \"wanton destruction\" and \u201ccarefully pre-planned\u201d.\n\nWestminster Abbey belleringer Adrian Udal outside court (Champion News)\n\nAnd now Mr Udal - Secretary of the Belfry at St Margaret\u2019s Church, a medieval building next to Westminster Abbey which acts as place of worship for the Houses of Parliament - has been left facing a \u00a3100,000-plus bill after being ordered to pay the legal costs of the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a short hearing at Mayor's and City County Court, Judge Parfitt ordered him to pay \u00a385,000 up front towards his neighbours' estimated \u00a3100,000-plus legal bill.\n\nNicholas and Lisa Partick-Hiley outside Mayors and City County Court during a neighbours dispute (Champion News)\n\nHe will also have to pay the couple \u00a310,000 compensation for what he did, as well his own lawyers' significant costs, which have not been revealed in court.\n\nMr Udal is a veteran bell-ringer, whose Secretary of the Belfy role involves liasing with clergy when bellringing is needed for special church, state and parliamentary events, while he is proud to have \u201crung in\u201d the New Year almost every year since 2000.\n\nHe also works as a broadcast editor and has a keen interest in antique clocks, while his wife, Helen, is also a campanologist, being bell tower captain at St Gabriel\u2019s Church Pimlico.\n\nMr Partick-Hiley is a retired financier and former managing director and head of sales for North America investment banking specialists Panmure Gordon.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuring the trial last month, Judge Parfitt was told how the two neighbouring homes are in an unusual layout, with the Partick-Hileys\u2019 house located behind Mr Udal\u2019s property and reachable across a drive and through a passageway, which passes under part of his house and into their courtyard.\n\nThe drive and passageway are owned by Mr Udal, but the Partick-Hileys have the right to pass over it to get to their house, the court heard.\n\nWhen Nicholas Partick-Hiley arrived at his new house, he found the shutters and door being removed. Image shows the work in progress (Champion News)\n\nExplaining the background to the row, Mark Warwick KC, for the Partick-Hileys, said: \u201cOn the day of completion, Mr Partick-Hiley arrived at the property at about 12.10.\n\n\u201cHe was astonished to find Mr Udal and another man. The two men were in the process of destroying the door and gate. They were also disconnecting wiring that connected the property to various services.\n\n\"No advance warning of any kind had been given by Mr Udal, or anyone on his behalf, that such extraordinary behaviour was going to happen.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMr Partick-Hiley endeavoured to remain calm. He contacted his solicitors, he felt helpless.\n\n\u201cMr Udal and (the other man) continued with their demolition work until about 5pm.\n\n\u201cHis actions were plainly carefully pre-planned. No amount of persuasion, including the involvement of the police, has caused him to resile, or seemingly regret, his actions.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these actions, and contentions, has been serious, their quiet enjoyment and actual enjoyment of their home has been disrupted.\u201d\n\nImage shows location of dispute between Nicholas Partick-Hiley and Adrian Udal (Champion News)\n\nThe couple sued for an injunction against Mr Udal, claiming the right to put up new gates across the opening which leads to their house, citing \"security concerns\" in the affluent street.\n\nThey said they were aware of a conflict between their home\u2019s previous owner and Mr Udal before moving in, but thought it was settled until Mr Udal was witnessed dismantling the disputed gate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThrough their solicitors, they had contacted him two months before the move, explaining that they planned to install \u201cbetter looking and more functional gates\u201d once they moved in, although making clear they would welcome Mr Udal\u2019s input on the style and design of those gates.\n\nBut in response, the couple alleged their new neighbour began to plot how to remove and install new gates, buying his own set of metal barriers on July 13, 2023, which Mr Warwick claimed showed that \u201che was planning to carry out the destruction of the existing gates\u201d.\n\nWhen the day of completion arrived, \u201cMr Udal and his accomplice duly set about destroying the gates and disconnecting services running through the driveway\u201d, he added.\n\nTheir barrister claimed Mr Udal had \"carefully planned\" what he did and did so \"at a time to cause maximum disruption and distress.\"\n\nThe location of dispute between Nicholas Partick-Hiley and Adrian Udal in Disbrowe Road, Fulham (Champion News)\n\nSoon afterwards, the couple\u2019s lawyers wrote to Mr Udal insisting that the removed gates were their property and that it was up to them to decide what alternatives should be put in their place.\n\n\u201cMr Udal disagreed,\u201d said the KC, adding: \u201cOn 10 September, he began to hang metal gates, of his own choosing, right next to the pavement.\u201d\n\nIn court, the couple insisted they have the right to erect and site entrance gates \"on either side of the opening that runs under part of Mr Udal's house,\" plus the right to park a car in the area.\n\nBut Mr Udal insisted their right only extends to having the strip gated at the front of the property next to the pavement and they have no right to have a car on his land.\n\nHe said that in removing the existing roller gate and door, and installing a new gate next to the pavement at the end of the driveway, he had done no more than assert his legitimate rights as freehold owner of the passage between the two homes.\n\nHanding victory to the bell master's neighbours, Judge Parfitt slammed his \"wrongful act of wanton destruction...which any reasonable and objective person should have realised would cause considerable upset and discomfort\" and ordered him to pay \u00a310,000 damages.\n\n\"Mr Udal was a poor witness who came across as preferring his own perception of what might be helpful to his own case, regardless of any objective reality,\" he continued.\n\n\"The overall impression was that truth for him, in the context of legal proceedings at least, was no obstacle to a clever argument about language or the other evidence.\n\n\"He referred to his destruction of the roller shutter and furniture as his having 'returned' it to (the former owner). This is also using expressions normally used to describe something helpful - getting something back to the owner - as a means of sugar-coating the reality of what he was doing: destroying part of the claimants\u2019 property on the very day they were moving in and would have expected to find the roller shutter and furniture providing a secure and private barrier between the road and their new house.\n\n\"On a balance of probabilities, the defendant had planned to destroy the roller shutter and furniture on the day of completion and perhaps hoped that it would be a fait accompli by the time the claimants arrived. In any event, he continued his actions even after they had arrived and it was clear that they objected.\"\n\nThe judge found that the gates Mr Udal removed were in the correct position and that the couple have a right \u201cto pass and re-pass either on foot, or with or without vehicles\" down the drive and passage.\n\nHe added: \"Mr Udal's actions in respect of the roller gates and furniture was an inappropriate and wrongful act of wanton destruction designed, in my view, to, at best, take advantage of the gap between owners occurring at completion, and conduct which any reasonable and objective person should have realised would cause considerable upset and discomfort to the new owners.\"\n\nReturning to court last week to decide on matters consequential to his judgment, Judge Parfitt ordered Mr Udal to tear out the gate he installed within two weeks.\n\nHe said the Partick-Hileys would have the right to install their own, but that if it is to be lockable they must ensure that Mr Udal is able to get in if he wants to get to the back of his house.\n\nHe also ordered him to pay \u00a385,000 towards their lawyers' bills - estimated at over \u00a3100,000 - ahead of an assessment at a later date. His own lawyers' bills were not revealed in court papers.\n\nRepresenting himself via a video link, Mr Udal said he was planning to challenge the decision on appeal.",
