(Getty)\n\nThose with lower scores were found to have higher mortality rates.\n\nMiddle-aged and older people who needed no support to sit or stand were six times less likely to die of heart disease and cardiovascular conditions over the next decade compared to people who wobbled on the way up or down, and had difficulty completing the task.\n\nTest yourself with a partner\n\nAuthor of the study \ufeffClaudio Gil Ara\u00fajo warned not to do this test alone. \ufeff\n\nAnyone with a disability, like a hip or spine injury, or anyone with serious joint problems, shouldn't do the test, as it can cause unnecessary pain. \ufeff\n\nGet another person to watch you and score your sitting and standing movements by following the Sitting-Rising Test (SRT) system:\n\nPlace a cushion under you to avoid injuries if you fall.\n\nThe test begins with 5 points for the sitting action and 5 points for the rising action, totalling 10 points.\n\nStart with 5 points for the sitting action. Try to lower yourself by crossing one foot in front of the other, and lower yourself.\n\nOne point is subtracted for each support used, such as a hand, forearm or knee.\n\nIf one hand is placed on the knee for support, it counts as a support; deduct one point.\n\nHalf a point (0.5) is subtracted if the action is as unsteady, indicating a partial loss of balance.\n\nA score of 0 is given if the person is not able to sit from the floor without external assistance (like using a table or wall to sit and stand, or with another person's help).\n\nOnce on the floor, begin the standing action. Start with another 5 points.\n\nScore the standing action in the same way, deduct a point for using a support and half a point (0.5) for a wobble.\n\nScore a 0 if they are unable to stand without external help. \ufeff\n\nThe final score is obtained by adding the sitting and rising partial scores, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 10.\n\nThe test is supposed to measure a range of health aspects, such as muscular health, balance, flexibility and body composition.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump makes Iran attack deadline public\n\nThe test is supposed to measure a range of health aspects, such as muscular health, balance, flexibility and body composition. (Getty)\n\nWhat does my score mean? \ufeff\n\nBased on the study, your SRT score provides an indication of your non-aerobic physical fitness. This is linked to your risk of natural death and death caused by cardiovascular disease/illness.\n\nSRT Score of 10 (Perfect Score) :\n\nA perfect score indicates excellent non-aerobic fitness, including muscle strength, flexibility and balance.\n\nA score of 10 is associated with the lowest risk of natural mortality, with a death rate of 3.7 per cent.\n\nThose with a perfect score had a cardiovascular death rate of 0.9 per cent.\n\nSurvival rates in this group after a decade were at 97 per cent.\n\nHigher scores are also related to easier performance of daily activities, increased participation in physical activity, exercise, and sports, and potentially a better overall quality of life\n\nSRT Score of 8 :\n\nA score of 8 typically means you used only one hand or knee for support to sit and rise from the floor\n\nThe natural causes death rate for this group was 11.1 per cent, which is triple the rate of those who scored a perfect 10.\n\nSurvival rates after a decade were at 88 per cent for this group.\n\nSRT Scores of 4.5-7.5 :\n\nA score between 4.5 and 7.5 was associated with an increased risk of premature death\n\nPeople in this group had a 2.23 times increased risk of natural death compared to those with a score of 10\n\nPeople in this group had a 3.25 times increased risk of cardiovascular deaths compared to those with a score of 10\n\nThe death rate for natural causes in this group was 20.4 per cent.\n\nLower SRT scores meant a higher risk of cardiovascular deaths (Getty)\n\nSRT Scores of 0-4 (Lowest Scores) :\n\nScores between 0 to 4 indicate poor non-aerobic fitness.\n\nThese scores were associated with a significantly higher risk of natural and cardiovascular deaths.\n\nPeople in this group had a 3.48 times higher risk of natural death compared to those with a score of 10.\n\nPeople in this group had a 6.05 times higher risk of cardiovascular death compared to those with a score of 10.\n\nThe death rate for natural causes was 42.1 per cent.\n\nSurvival rates in this group after a decade were 73.\n\nThese scores often present with an unhealthy combination of excess body fat, dynapenia (muscle weakness), reduced body flexibility, and poor static balance. This could increase the risk of falls and limit daily activities and exercise, adversely impacting survival\n\nA Rising Score of 0 :\n\nSpecifically indicates an inability to rise alone from the floor . .\n\nNearly half (49.5%) of the participants with this score died during the follow-up period of 10 years.\n\nPeople with this score showed a five to six times higher risk of natural deaths and cardiovascular deaths compared to those with a rising score of 5.\n\nA higher SRT score reflects better physical fitness and is linked to a significantly lower risk of death from natural and cardiovascular causes.\n\nLower scores indicate poorer non-aerobic fitness and a substantially elevated mortality risk.",

It's voluntary and it's industry-led,\" Cr Lorenston said.\n\n\"We're just enabling these sorts of programs where the industry shows other cafe operators how to transition out of coffee cups.\"\n\nThe motion passed four votes to three and the council believed it to be the first such initiative in Queensland.\n\nIn December, the small town of Bermagui on the NSW South Coast adopted a similar approach.\n\nThe majority of cafes there have joined forces to eliminate disposable coffee cups from their businesses.\n\nCan Noosa lead the way in Queensland with a single-use coffee cup ban?

    "text": "When the nation's largest mainland gas project was given provisional approval to keep running until 2070, the West Australian premier heralded it as an economic boost for the state.\n\n\"It's not just important for our overall economy, it's important for regional WA,\" Roger Cook told reporters.\n\nBut the most recent state budget papers show the shared revenue, or royalties, the project is generating for WA is in rapid decline.\n\nA royalty is a fee charged for the right to extract a mineral resource.\n\nIn the 2022-'23 financial year, royalties from the North West Shelf (NWS) gas project on WA's north-west coast, delivered more than $1.3 billion to the state's coffers.\n\nThat number is now tipped to drop by more than 70 per cent to $365 million in the 2025-'26 financial year.\n\nThat amounts to 0.7 per cent of the state's $50.2 billion revenue, and just 6 per cent of the $6.6 billion generated by iron ore royalties.\n\nDeclining gas fields\n\nThe drop in revenue is because the project's original gas fields are depleting.\n\nWhen the NWS began production in 1984, it was required to give 10 per cent of the revenue from each gas well to the Commonwealth.\n\nA legal change four years later meant future offshore projects would not pay royalties, but a 40 per cent tax on profits, known as the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT).\n\nTwo-thirds of the revenue from the NWS is redirected to WA.\n\nBut as those gas fields deplete, so does their revenue, and there have been new gas sources processed at the NWS since 1988 that do not generate royalties.\n\n\"The North-West Shelf project [is] forecast to process higher volumes of gas sourced from areas outside the revenue-sharing agreement,\" the 2025-'26 state budget papers read.\n\nPrincipal adviser to progressive think-tank The Australia Institute Mark Ogge said he had not seen any evidence the new gas sources required to extend the NWS would have royalty agreements attached to them.\n\nMark Ogge has long argued the country does not get a fair return on the large volumes of gas it exports overseas. (ABC News: Peter Drought)\n\n\"Australia is being robbed of its resources and our governments are entirely complicit,\" he said.\n\nMr Ogge said West Australians reading the latest budget should be outraged.\n\n\"According to budget forward estimates, Western Australian motorists will be paying six times the amount in car rego collectively as the gas industry [pays in royalties],\" Mr Ogge said.\n\nRevenue tipped to bounce back\n\nOil and gas analyst and consultant Jeanette Roberts believed it was likely new revenue-sharing agreements would be signed if the NWS extension was finalised.\n\n\"I think that's the most likely scenario,\" Ms Roberts said.\n\nA spokesperson for Environment Minister Murray Watt would not comment on whether royalties had featured in the negotiations over the NWS extension because the decision was not final yet.\n\nMs Roberts pointed said the oil and gas industry made other contributions to the Australian economy through taxes.\n\n\"Tax is more than just Petroleum Resource Rent Tax and state royalties, it's also GST, corporate taxes, a whole bunch of contributions gas companies pay,\" she said.\n\nThe industry's peak lobby group, Australian Energy Producers, claimed the sector paid $17 billion in taxes and royalties nationally in the 2023-'24 financial year.\n\nWoodside says the North West Shelf has generated $40 billion in royalties since the 1980s. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)\n\nA spokesperson for Woodside, which manages the NWS, said the project had contributed $40 billion to Australia since beginning production in 1984.\n\n\"Including more than $18 billion to the WA government,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThey would not comment on any future royalty-sharing agreements.\n\nAccording to the Australian Taxation Office's corporate tax transparency report, the company paid $2.6 billion in income tax in the 2022-'23 financial year.\n\nCalls for more royalty agreements\n\nMr Ogge from the Australia Institute said the public should still expect more from the industry given there were large offshore gas fields near WA where royalties were not being charged.\n\n\"Vast amounts of gas are processed in Western Australia from offshore fields and exported, making tens of billions of dollars every year for these companies,\" he said.\n\n\"I just cannot understand why the federal government doesn't charge royalties on the vast majority of gas being exported from Western Australia.\"\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers was approached for comment but did not directly respond to questions.\n\nLast year, the federal government made changes to the PRRT, which it claims has brought in more tax revenue from the oil and gas sector.",

    "text": "England has been left to rue sending India in to bat at Headingley in the first Test of their five-game series, with the tourists dominating day one with the bat to finish 3-359.\n\nThe retirement of icons Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in less than a year piled the pressure on the next generation to step up, and new skipper Shubman Gill (127*) and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (101) immediately looked ready to fill the void.\n\nThe additional absence of Ravichandran Ashwin and his 537 Test wickets left India facing a daunting task during the tour of England.\n\nWith England missing several frontline bowlers through injury for the series opener in Leeds, India was keen to make an early mark.\n\nJaiswal and Gill proved there was still plenty of depth left in the Indian batting line-up as the visitors piled on the runs to reach stumps on top after Ben Stokes won the toss and chose to field.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan said he was \"staggered\" by the decision to send India in on a dry pitch in sunny conditions, despite England's penchant for audacious run chases under Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.\n\n\"Just because you've won a year ago, two years ago or three years ago, it can't really affect what the decision is today. And they've allowed India with a youngish batting line-up and a new captain to just go and play,\" Vaughan said in commentary for the BBC.\n\n\" You look at the England side and their strength, really, is in the batting. Ben just had a gut feeling, I guess, and in recent times it's worked. \"\n\nThe next 10 Tests could define how the \"Bazball\" combination of Stokes and McCullum are viewed, after plenty of highs and lows over the past few years, with the Ashes series in Australia following India's visit.\n\nEach of the previous six Test matches have been won by the side bowling first, including Australia's losses in the 2019 and 2023 Ashes, but only once in that stretch (New Zealand in 2022) did the opening innings exceed 300 runs.\n\nOpener Jaiswal was not overawed by any stretch, as he became the first Indian batter to score centuries in his first match in both Australia and England with a flawless display of off-side batting.\n\nThree of the 23-year-old's five centuries have come against England, having amassed a colossal 813 runs in 10 Tests when facing McCullum's side.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWhile Jaiswal dealt with the heat on a scorching Leeds day, Gill could not have been under more scrutiny.\n\nWithout a Test century outside Asia, Gill came to the crease in Kohli's number four position in the order, with quick wickets before lunch swinging the momentum in England's favour.\n\nAfter back-to-back fours in the 32nd over settled his early nerves, Gill sprayed boundaries to all corners, bringing up his hundred with a glorious drive through the covers.\n\nAll-rounder Stokes, for his part, was the best of England's bowlers as he took 2-43 from 13 overs.\n\nIt is the 34-year-old's second Test this year after tearing his hamstring while playing against New Zealand in December.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"There's global economic turmoil,\" Treasurer Rita Saffioti said of the shift in focus.\n\n\"We need to make sure we protect Western Australia and help Western Australia grow into the future.\n\n\"We don't want WA to be collateral damage in global economic chaos.\"\n\nMining hoarding state's workforce\n\nRaymond Da Silva Rosa studies what drives corporate investment at the University of Western Australia and backed the government's plans to try and increase productivity across the state.\n\n\"We have a budget that's in surplus, we have an economy that's booming, we have a state government that has pretty much total control of the political agenda,\" he said.\n\n\"So all the pieces are in place for the government to take some considerable risks that other governments can't afford to.\"\n\nProfessor Raymond Da Silva Rosa backed the government's plans to boost productivity in WA.

(ABC News: James Carmody)\n\n\"So looking at some of that infrastructure around the energy transition, but also really looking at our housing situation.\n\n\"If people can't get houses here there's not really going to be much investment and much desire for new industries to grow and develop here in WA.\"\n\nThat backing from the private sector will be critical to making the government's vision a reality \u2014 because without businesses changing where and how they spend money, the shape of the economy won't change.\n\n\"If you can't encourage [the] private sector to invest in WA, none of these things are going to take off,\" Ms Winzar said.\n\nSaffioti used an address to a business breakfast yesterday to encourage them to back the government's plans.\n\n\"We're here, ready to work with industry, making sure we can deliver on our commitments,\" she said.\n\nRita Saffioti said her second budget as treasurer aimed to fortify WA amid global turmoil. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nAsked later in the day what would happen if businesses didn't change their spending, the treasurer said the combination of providing initial infrastructure and capital with long-term government purchase agreements was attractive to industry.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of excitement, and just speaking to a few people today, I think that there's a real willingness,\" she said.\n\nFuture in high-end services\n\nDespite the broad support, Ms Winzar and Professor da Silva Rossa questioned the government's focus on manufacturing as a priority area, beyond a few niche industries.\n\n\"We're a very high-cost state, labour-wise, in a high-cost country,\" Ms Winzar said.\n\n\"Manufacturing across Australia is always going to be challenging.\n\nMs Winzar questioned the government's focus on manufacturing. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\n\"It's particularly challenging in WA when we've got competing demands for labour from industries such as mining.\"\n\nProfessor da Silva Rosa said there were strengths the government should try to leverage, which could be enhanced by boosting the quality of primary and secondary education.\n\n\"The services sector is the one that dominates, so it's more about high-end services, like medical services, computers and the like, engineering services,\" he said.\n\n\" Not so much putting things together. That's where the future is. \"\n\nPayroll tax a sticking point\n\nFor its part, the opposition continues to argue payroll tax is an unnecessary roadblock to economic growth.\n\nPayroll tax is paid to the state government by all businesses whose wage bill exceeds $1 million each year, and is expected to bring in $6.2 billion next financial year.\n\n\"WA businesses face a disincentive when they hire people,\" Shadow Treasurer Sandra Brewer said.\n\nSandra Brewer says payroll tax is an unnecessary roadblock to growth. (ABC News: Briana Shepherd)\n\n\"Our payroll tax, particularly for small businesses, are the highest in the country.\"\n\nShe made the case alongside Jay Sidhu, who owns a land surveying business and said the tax had influenced his thinking as demand for his services grew.\n\n\"Me and my business partners have to consider it before we even think of growing,\" he said.\n\nMs Brewer said those costs were often passed directly on to customers.\n\nJay Sidhu says the WA government's payroll tax has such a significant financial impact on his land surveying company that it is not viable to hire beyond the company's current 20 employers. (ABC News: Briana Shepherd)\n\n\"So what we're saying is, the government could help housing affordability by looking at all of the taxes on business, and seeing where they can reform,\" she said.\n\nAsked at the business breakfast if a Labor government was ever likely to consider changes to payroll tax, Ms Saffioti said: \"Every budget we consider everything.\"\n\nWA budget aims to build fortress around economy Photo shows WA Treasurer Rita Saffioti stands speaking in parliament. WA Premier Roger Cook's first budget since being elected in his own right has a clear theme, and it's not cost-of-living relief. Instead, he and Treasurer Rita Saffito want to insulate the state from the global economic shocks ahead.\n\n\"But also it's about the approvals process,\" she said.\n\n\"So we're working across the breadth of the economy to [see] what we can do in relation to supporting industry and business.\"\n\nMs Winzar said that was another area which needed to be looked at closely to attract investment to the state.\n\n\"What often happens in WA is we have really good small businesses and they're looking to expand, and they feel like they can't do it in WA because they don't have access to the right resources, to get the right labour,\" she said.\n\n\"The tax and regulation settings don't encourage them to grow here, so they leave either for interstate or overseas.\n\n\"We really want to encourage all those businesses to stay, to grow here, and other businesses to come set up here.\"",

( ) Stranded passengers in Valencia. (Reuters: Eva Manez)\n\nImmediately in the wake of the blackout, a furious war of words erupted between those opposed to renewable energy and those in favour of it.\n\nCritics of renewable energy pointed out that most of Spain's power at the time of the crisis was being generated by solar and wind.\n\nJavier Blas, a high-profile reporter for Bloomberg, described the events as \"the first big blackout of the green electricity era\".\n\nSara Aagesen, Spain's environment minister, stressed while releasing the report that renewable energy was not to blame for the catastrophic failure.\n\nInstead, she said, there was a \"confluence of factors\" that contributed to the system careening out of control.\n\n\"We have a solid narrative of events and a verified explanation that allows us to reflect and to act as we surely will,\" Ms Aagesen told reporters.\n\n\"We believe in the energy transition and we know it's not an ideological question but one of this country's principal vectors of growth when it comes to re-industrialisation opportunities.\"\n\nMs Gamez says the truth in this case \u2014 as it is with virtually any blackout of sufficient scale \u2014 is extremely complex.\n\nHe notes that even in the lead-up to the fateful day of April 28, there had been more \"voltage instability\" on the Iberian Peninsula than normal.\n\nThen, on the day, he says there was a major oscillation that caused voltage fluctuations lasting almost 5 minutes and prompting the system operator to reduce the flows of power between Spain and France.\n\nThe precise cause of the disruption is still not known, but Mr Gamez says it seems a big solar farm in the south of the country was taken offline around that time for reasons that may be as simple as low wholesale prices.\n\nA 'cascading' crisis\n\nThe loss of a major solar farm is believed to have triggered the initial turbulence in the grid. ( )\n\nNo sooner had the initial response been taken, he says, when another, albeit smaller, jolt rocked the system.\n\nIt was at this point, Mr Gamez says, where the wheels started to fall off as voltage levels climbed and power plants began to switch off \u2014 or trip \u2014 to safeguard against damage.\n\n\"What happened is the voltage across the network started climbing very rapidly,\" Mr Gamez says.\n\n\"And their main point of the conclusion is they lacked the ability to compensate for the voltage hikes.\"\n\nAs voltages rose to dangerously high levels and the frequency correspondingly fell, the report found the crisis became impossible to contain, the connection with France was severed and the grid went black.\n\nThis week, the Spanish government spread the blame between the company that runs the country's transmission network as well as electricity companies.\n\nAlthough stopping short of naming the specific plants involved and their owners, the report said a number of generators failed in their job of helping to keep the system stable.\n\nAn official report into Spain's blackout has pointed the finger at some nuclear and gas plants. ( )\n\nAnd it pointed the finger at the \"synchronous\" \u2014 in Spain's case gas or nuclear \u2014 plants that were being paid that day to maintain safe voltage levels.\n\n\"Several of the plants capable of regulating voltage \u2026 did not respond adequately to the system operator's instructions to reduce it,\" the report found.\n\n\"Some even produced \u2026 the opposite of what was required, contributing to the problems.\"\n\nCentral to this criticism was a little-known phenomenon called reactive power, which must be managed to keep voltage levels in check.\n\nComplexity 'brings risk'\n\nAccording to Mr Gamez, a key feature of the Iberian blackout was the inability of the grid to cope with reactive power levels on the day.\n\nEssentially, the grid could not absorb the rising voltages that brought the whole system undone.\n\nHe says this inability has little to do with the transition away from conventional power plants such as coal and gas generators towards renewable energy.\n\nRather, he says it seems to reflect a failure to plan for a scenario like the one that unfolded on April 28.\n\n\"It came through that it wasn't that generation was insufficient,\" he notes.\n\n\"It was just the inability to react properly to what was happening.\"\n\nPolice direct traffic around the CBD in Adelaide after the power network stops working. ( )\n\nLonger-term, Mr Gamez says perhaps the biggest lesson to be drawn from the Spanish experience is the growing risks in managing a grid that is ever more complicated.\n\nHe says no two blackouts are ever the same, they are extremely rare and almost always involve multiple things going wrong.\n\nBut he also notes grids are, by and large the world over, changing at speed.\n\nWhereas historically they were centrally planned, relatively simple systems where there were a few big generators, they have been rapidly becoming diffused, dynamic and trickier to manage.\n\n\"I think the complexity of the systems is overwhelming our existing rules and regulations and technical procedures and things like that,\" he says.\n\n\"This is just systems, both in the regulatory and technical practices, not reacting fast enough to the complexity of what has just been built.\"",

(Supplied: Terry Kelly)\n\nWhile Mr Kelly admitted he was no shipwright, he mused shipbuilding might be in his blood, via Norwegian ancestors.\n\n\"I don't think they made Viking boats but, in the 19th century, they were building fishing boats or other boats along the coast there,\" he said.\n\n\"We spent at least a dozen hours on the design and I made the head and the tail at home.\n\n\"The design of the dragon head was inspired by a ship in the Viking museum in Oslo.\"\n\nA fiery success\n\nErika the Red is the second ship to be burned as part of Cape Clear's annual Winter Solstice Bonfire.\n\nThe township torched the Lightning last year, which was loosely modelled on a clipper that sank off the Geelong coast in 1869 after catching fire with a cargo of wool on its way back to England.\n\nThe Cape Clear lighthouse is 100km from the ocean.

    "text": "The British and Irish Lions of 2025 have had an inauspicious start to their tour of Australia, losing 28-24 to Argentina at a raucous Aviva stadium in Dublin.\n\nIt is the first time that the Lions have lost an opening tour match since 1971 and 20 years since Argentina drew with the Lions in Cardiff.\n\nFirst-half tries to Ignacio Mendy and player of the match Tom\u00e1s Albornoz gave Argentina a 21-10 lead at half-time, local favourite Bundee Aki crossing for the Lions in a sloppy defensive display.\n\nBut after that disappointing first half the contest developed into a thrilling game in which both teams threw the ball around with the apparent abandon of a post-season friendly.\n\nThe Lions hit back early in the second half through a penalty try and a Tadhg Beirne score to give the hosts the lead.\n\nBut a trilling score by Santiago Cordero saw the Lions fall to a deflating defeat as the Pumas celebrated in style on the pitch and reminded the Lions hierarchy that perhaps South America too would one day be a worthy tour destination.\n\nTom\u00e1s Albornoz scored one of three thrilling tries for the Argentine side. (AP Photo: Peter Morrison)\n\nThe Lions rarely play matches on home soil and, in the bright sunshine of a summer Friday night in Dublin, there was a degree of frivolity in the sold-out stands far from the pressure cooker of a Test match \u2014 albeit one where the Lions were not handing out official Test caps.\n\nWho will be playing for the Lions? Photo shows Maro Itoje sits with Andy Farrell The British and Irish Lions name the squad ahead of this year's tour of Australia. Here's everything you need to know about who has been selected.\n\nAny suggestion that this was a fun kickabout in the Dublin sun was dispelled by the stern words that veteran tourists Maro Itoje and Elliot Daly imparted in the post-match huddle.\n\nNo doubt those conversations will continue on the plane Down Under, with the squad departing for Australia on Saturday morning.\n\n\"I think there are a few learnings. I think we showed glimmers of what this team can be about,\" Itoje said post-match.\n\n\"I think there were a few teething issues, [it was] our first run out.\n\n\"We'll take our lessons \u2026 we'll learn from our mistakes and move forward.\"\n\nMany of those teething issues came at the lineout, where the Lions were awful, and in defence, where Argentina's pacing attack tore the line to shreds.\n\nThis is not the first-choice Lions team that will likely suit up in Brisbane on July 19 \u2014 just three Irish players made the starting XV due to the Leinster contingent's participation in the United Rugby Championship final last weekend.\n\nBut it was still an all-star-packed side that will have been chastened by the enthusiasm and skill of the Argentina side, who were missing plenty of players themselves, in front of them.\n\nThe Lions lineout was not good enough. (AP Photo: Peter Morrison)\n\n\"We're building a team,\" Itoje added.\n\n\"We were nowhere near as consistent or accurate.\n\n\"We'll learn, we'll get better.\"\n\nDespite the defeat, that improvement was evident as the game went on.\n\nThe Lions offered a glimpse of how Farrell wants his side to play and, against a ready and willing Argentine side that have claimed the scalps of all three southern hemisphere giants in the past 12 months, they showed glimmers of real class.\n\nThe scrum was utterly dominant \u2014 even with Irish pair Andrew Porter and Tadhg Furlong not involved \u2014 as Ellis Genge showed all his power.\n\nIt also indicated some combinations that Farrell may be interested in using, including a power-packed centre partnership of Aki and Sione Tuipulotu.\n\nFin Smith started at 10 but Marcus Smith, playing 15, popped up at first receiver with abandon in the latter stages of the match, flashing his fast feet and poking his nose through the line with increasing regularity.\n\nThat being said, both were overshadowed by the superb play of Benneton flyhalf Albornoz.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe polish may not have been there from the Lions, but the speed at which they attempted to play was indicative of the assault the Wallabies line will be under whenever they are without the ball \u2014 this Lions team will be coming to entertain as well as win.\n\nWinger Tommy Freeman in particular was supreme in the air, a warning to avoid kicking in his direction should he make the cut for the test team.\n\nBut the pack, admittedly shorn of many of its key personnel, will need to step up \u2014 particularly in the lineout, which was desperately poor.\n\nThe Lions will have precious little time to regroup, with post-match briefings perhaps taking place on the long flight Down Under this weekend.\n\nThe nine-match tour, with three Tests and six tour matches, kicks off in Perth on Saturday, June 28 against the Western Force, where the Lions will no doubt be desperate to kick off their tour proper with a win.\n\nBritish and Irish Lions: Marcus Smith; Tommy Freeman, Sione Tuipulotu, Bundee Aki, Duhan van der Merwe; Fin Smith, Alex Mitchell; Ellis Genge, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Finlay Bealham, Maro Itoje (c), Tadhg Beirne, Tom Curry, Jac Morgan, Ben Earl.\n\nReplacements: Ronan Kelleher, Pierre Schoeman, Tadhg Furlong, Scott Cummings, Henry Pollock, Tomos Williams, Elliot Daly, Mack Hansen.\n\nArgentina: Santiago Carreras; Rodrigo Isgr\u00f3, Lucio Cinti, Justo Piccardo, Ignacio Mendy; Tom\u00e1s Albornoz, Gonzalo Garcia; Mayco Vivas, Juli\u00e1n Montoya (c), Joel Sclavi, Franco Molina, Pedro Rubiolo, Pablo Matera, Juan Martin Gonz\u00e1lez, Joaqu\u00edn Oviedo,\n\nReplacements: Bautista Bernasconi, Boris Wenger, Francisco Coria Marchetti, Santiago Grondona, Joaqu\u00edn Moro, Simon Benitez Cruz, Mat\u00edas Moroni, Santiago Cordero.",

    "text": "For Roylene Robinson, raising hundreds of children has been challenging but \"very rewarding\".\n\nFor almost half a century, she has been a foster mum.\n\n\"Mother's Day is a very, very big day,\" the 76-year-old said.\n\n\"It's either the phone ringing or you've got emails or you've got messages or you've got people calling in \u2026 I find it very, very rewarding on Mother's Day.\"\n\nMs Robinson has cared for hundreds of children. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nMs Robinson has fostered 280 children over the past 47 years in her humble Rockhampton home in central Queensland.\n\nShe also has four children of her own.\n\nThe single carer said love and encouragement were two of the most important things a parent figure could offer a foster child.\n\n\"There's a lot of work involved but it's lovely when you see the end product and they come back home and they're all settled and everything's good for them,\" she said.\n\nMs Robinson is also the heart and soul behind this charity store in central Queensland. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nHelping the needy\n\nMs Robinson dedicates her life not just to children, but to everyone in need.\n\nThe doors to her charity store, Moo and Coo, open at 10 each morning and within a few minutes, it's always a hive of activity.\n\n\"Everything's cheaper, much cheaper and it's like the original op shops,\" she said.\n\nBeanies are in high demand in the cooler months. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\n\"This is what op shops were years ago where people could come in find what they need and have a cup of tea.\n\n\" We've always got a box of tissues available because you become a social worker as well, I think. \"\n\nMs Robinson is the heart and soul of the not-for-profit organisation that provides essentials like food, clothing and furniture to people in need.\n\n\"This is a quiet morning. Saturdays [and] Wednesdays are much, much bigger,\" she said.\n\nMs Robinson's op shop accepts donations of food for people. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nCost-of-living impacts\n\nWith the nation in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis, Ms Robinson says many residents, particularly those on lower incomes, are struggling to afford basic needs like food, fuel, rent and electricity.\n\nA retiree drives to the most desperate Photo shows Two women hug Advocates say a critical undersupply of housing has forced people onto the streets. But as more councils disperse homeless camps, rough sleepers are left with nowhere to go.\n\nWhile the state and federal governments are taking steps to address the issue, the situation remains challenging for many.\n\n\"We do care packages, food packages, clothing, kitchen packs, baby packs for the hospital, so we do everything that we can, right now blankets and everything to keep the needy warm and fed,\" Ms Robinson said.\n\n\"We quite often heat up the meals for the people off the street and give them a knife and fork.\"\n\nMs Robinson and her team of volunteers do up care packs with essentials such as hygiene items. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nLaurel Mason is a social worker who regularly brings her clients \u2014 mainly those sleeping rough on the streets \u2014 to Ms Robinson's store.\n\n\"Sometimes my clients just need some clothing but sometimes we come for the whole lot,\" Ms Mason said.\n\nMs Mason admitted she had even experienced challenges in meeting increased cost-of-living expenses in recent times.\n\n\"I know even for myself, I've used Roylene's shop at one point when I wasn't working, so it was a great help to me at that time,\" she said.\n\nLaurel Mason says the service helps not only her clients but the wider community. (ABC Capricornia: Aaron Kelly)\n\nAccording to a survey of 3,600 people who had accessed assistance from The Salvation Army, 90 per cent reported it was difficult to afford essential living costs, such as housing, groceries, medical care and utilities over the past 12 months.\n\nThe 2025 Red Shield report also found 70 per cent of respondents said cost of living was their biggest challenge in the past year while 87 per cent of households with children were living below the poverty line.\n\nAffordable clothing makes it easier for individuals and families to access essentials.

    "text": "If the wheels of justice grind slowly, that pace has just taken a considerable hit in NSW, courtesy of an unlikely suspect: a burst water main.\n\nSittings had just begun in one of the country's busiest court buildings on Tuesday morning when courtrooms and foyers throughout the Downing Centre's seven bustling levels were plunged into darkness.\n\nMagistrates and judges left the bench as emergency fluorescent lights activated.\n\nThe Downing Centre's seven levels were plunged into darkness. (ABC News: Ethan Rix)\n\nBemusement perhaps described the mood in one of its largest courtrooms on level five, as lawyers made small talk during the wait for information.\n\nOne magistrate returning to collect papers from the bench quipped it was \"like a disco in here\".\n\nSoon after, the building was evacuated and as hundreds of public servants, legal practitioners, defendants and court reporters filed down emergency exit stairs, the cause became clear.\n\nWater gushed from drains on Castlereagh Street in Sydney's CBD, which runs down one side of the former department store.\n\nIt has since been revealed flooding in the lower level of the heritage-listed building caused \"extensive damage\" to the infrastructure, including electricity and IT equipment.\n\nHundreds of people that work in the building had to be evacuated. (ABC News: Ethan Rix)\n\nOn current estimates, repairs will take at least four weeks.\n\n\"There is going to be a huge domino effect,\" Jennifer Ball, president of the Law Society of NSW, told the ABC at the end of the working week.\n\n\"We've already got some backlogs \u2026 and the courts have been doing their utmost best to try to have the matters heard.\n\n\"Now with this delay, with the court already being closed for two days now and for the foreseeable future until the repairs are done, we don't know how big that domino effect will be.\"\n\n'Heartbeat of judicial access'\n\nTo understand why this closure is significant, you only need to look at the sheer volume of cases that pass through the Downing Centre \u2014 tens of thousands of matters are dealt with there each year.\n\nOn the day of the flooding, there were more than 500 listings.\n\nJennifer Ball from the Law Society says the disruption is \"enormous\". (ABC News: Ethan Rix)\n\nA magistrate may have 150 matters on their docket on any given sitting day in the Local Court, not to mention District Court matters and ongoing trials in that jurisdiction.\n\nMs Ball describes the building as the \"heartbeat of judicial access\" for scores of people in NSW.\n\n\"The disruption is quite enormous.\"\n\nThe Department of Communities and Justice said assessment of the damage is ongoing and court staff are making \"every effort to ensure matters are able to proceed wherever possible\".\n\nPriority in the District Court has been placed on proceedings of some age, and where the accused is in custody.\n\nIt's been announced that some part-heard trials \"will have to be aborted\".\n\nBut it is \"inevitable that some part-heard trials will have to be aborted\", according to information handed to the NSW Bar Association from the Chief Judge of the District Court.\n\nThe scramble to relist and relocate cases will have placed considerable pressure on registries and staff.\n\nConfusion and relocations\n\nMany matters have been shifted to the John Maddison Tower, on the other side of the block.\n\nOne magistrate on Friday told parties appearing before her the \"great flood\" has meant she has completely lost access to her chambers.\n\nJane Sanders, principal solicitor at the Shopfront Youth Legal Centre, said it's been a confusing week, particularly for clients.\n\nBut professional bodies including the Bar Association and the Law Society have done their best to keep practitioners updated, as has the Department.\n\n\"It has been really difficult,\" Ms Sanders told the ABC.\n\n\"I think the courts have been working things out as they go along.\n\n\"They've had to find \u2014 in a really short space of time \u2014 other courtrooms in other buildings where they can move things for defendants in criminal cases who are in custody which, unfortunately, I would say there's far too many.\"\n\nMany matters have been relocated due to the flooding. (ABC News: Ethan Rix)\n\nThirteen people in custody in the downstairs cells of the Downing Centre had to be relocated for their safety on Tuesday. Two people had to be rescued from the lifts.\n\nMs Sanders said she has been told of audio visual-link (AVL) appearances being cancelled on Thursday because of an impression nothing would be proceeding.\n\n\"It has been a real shambles and that's no one's fault,\" she said\n\n\"I think everybody's been doing the best they can, but having to find courtrooms and different arrangements urgently, that's been a real challenge.\"\n\nWhile Ms Sanders believes an unexpected adjournment may not be an issue particularly if someone is facing a minor criminal charge, concerns arise when a defendant is on remand and refused bail.\n\nOn current estimates, repairs will take at least four weeks. (ABC News: Ethan Rix)\n\nAnd \"kicking the can down the road for a month\" may not be an option.\n\n\"There's also a whole list full of cases next month. So it's not that simple,\" she said.\n\nIt's not the first time the justice system has had to quickly adapt.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a heavier reliance was placed on AVLs and remote appearances.\n\nBut Ms Sanders said the difference here is that in many cases, the proceedings need to be recorded and conducted in accordance with procedures that can only happen inside a courtroom.\n\nThe heritage-listed building's infrastructure has been damaged. (ABC News: Ethan Rix)\n\n\"Even during the COVID pandemic where all of the lawyers, the defendants, in some cases witnesses, were all dialling in from remotely, we still had magistrates and judges sitting in a courtroom with the recording equipment,\" she said.\n\n\"With a few court staff to keep the wheels in motion with all the audio visual link equipment, all beaming into the court.\"\n\nIf there is any silver lining to be seen from the timing of the flood, it's that next week marks a three-day annual conference for magistrates, followed by a mid-year recess the following week, for the Local Court.",

    "text": "Hawthorn (Fifth, nine wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot: Jack Gunston has been on fire up forward, just when it seemed like he was destined to be a sub for much of the season, posting 28 goals and 13 goal assists. With Mitch Lewis and Calsher Dear on the comeback trail from injury, the Hawks needed Gunston desperately and he has delivered. Jai Newcombe has won plenty of the footy and played with his usual grunt, while Karl Amon continues to impress with his kicking skills and drive. Lloyd Meek fits perfectly as their ruckman, while the versatile Blake Hardwick has produced both in defence and as a stand-in forward. Jack Gunston of the Hawks celebrates a goal against Adelaide. Credit: AFL Photos Who\u2019s not: Will Day was on-track for the hot list until he suffered a stress fracture in his foot in April. The Hawks sorely miss his leadership and his ability to lift in key moments. They are a different side without him, and he\u2019s not due back until at least round 20. Jack Ginnivan was a match-winner for the Hawks last season but has been a little more inconsistent this campaign. Conor Nash has done well when on the field but his four-match ban for a late hit on Gryan Miers hurt the Hawks, who desperately missed his athleticism and versatility. The verdict: The Hawks are being graded on a much-higher curve this year, and they look like they have much more improvement left to come. They\u2019ve been unconvincing at times but have still won enough games to be within touch of the top four. Premierships aren\u2019t won in the first half of the season, but they can be lost through injuries and bad losses. Skipper James Sicily has battled injury, finally resting in the lead-up to the bye. His health, and how Day returns, will truly decide if this Hawks side pushes for a premiership, or fades out.\n\nRoy Ward\u2019s grade: B- Adelaide (Fourth, nine wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot: Jordan Dawson has been exceptional and should rank among the Brownlow contenders come season\u2019s end. He\u2019s a match-winner in the middle and a difference maker when pushing forward. Alex Neal-Bullen has made a big difference as a runner and ball-winner, while Ben Keays is approaching his best in a similar role. Riley Thilthorpe is approaching the peak of his powers as a key forward and contested mark option, and watch for Daniel Curtin \u2013 the tall wingman looks more dangerous with each game. Alex Neal-Bullen celebrates a goal with teammate Isaac Cumming. Credit: Getty Images Who\u2019s not: It\u2019s hard to find too many strugglers for the Crows but losing Matt Crouch to a hip injury for another four to six weeks hurts as he rates among their leaders in disposals while the onus will be on forwards Thilthorpe, Taylor Walker and Darcy Fogarty to convert their shots for goal and be as efficient as possible with scoring chances as that only becomes more important as the finals come around. Whether Nick Murray can return to a defensive role after a knee injury or whether Jordan Butts, Josh Worrell, Max Michalanney and Mark Keane retain those positions is also a watching brief.\n\nThe verdict: Aside from the early loss to Gold Coast, the Crows couldn\u2019t have asked for a better first half of the season. They are in the hunt for the top four, have the best percentage in the league and have relatively few serious injuries. Luck has been on the Crows\u2019 side in their wins over the Brisbane Lions and Port Adelaide. But they\u2019ve also made their own good fortune, with five wins by at least 60 points. Winning more away games and improving their defence will decide whether they are a real contender or fodder for the top sides. Roy Ward\u2019s grade: B+ West Coast Eagles (18th, one win, 13 losses) Who\u2019s hot: This is a tough question for a team that has just one win. But we are giving coach Andrew McQualter a break in his rookie season as he looks to implement a game plan that will turn this once-mighty club back around. Reuben Ginbey has shown good signs in defence, while midfielder Brady Hough looks promising. Recruits Liam Baker and Jack Graham have been solid, while Elijah Hewett has overcome injury to look like a long-term piece. Harley Reid is always in the spotlight, and has had bursts of brilliance, reinforcing why he will likely be the best player in the game down the track. He is averaging just under 18 disposals per game, and has nine goals for the season, but his ability to run out games remains an issue. Mid-season find Tom McCarthy was a standout against the Blues and shapes as a lock at halfback for the rest of the campaign. New boy: Eagles recruit Liam Baker, who won two premierships in his time with the Tigers, takes possession against his former team. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nWho\u2019s not: The Eagles, as a unit. When your coach rips you by declaring on national television that you have been \u201cpathetic in the contest\u201d, as McQualter said during quarter-time against the Blues last Sunday, that\u2019s a worry. Indeed, it\u2019s difficult not to say the Eagles have been pathetic for most of the season. Harsh? Perhaps. But look where they are sitting. Free-agent skipper Oscar Allen is hurt again, and may have played his last game for the club. Key forward Jake Waterman was already done for the year. Tim Kelly has openly discussed his motivational issues, due to the team\u2019s on-field woes. Elliot Yeo is injured and is yet to play a game this season. The Eagles do not have a frontline ruckman, and Reid\u2019s long-term future remains a daily talking point. Verdict: This was once a mighty, proud club (that is still a financial colossus) that had all teams fearful of coming to Perth, or when the Eagles arrived in town. It\u2019s been years since that was the case. They have just 11 wins since the start of the 2022 season, and major improvement appears years away. Ouch. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: E. Teams with the round 14 bye Collingwood (1st, 11 wins, 2 losses)\n\nWho\u2019s hot: That\u2019s an easy one to answer. The Magpies, as a collective, are. Having endured accusations they were too slow and old at the start of the season, these claims reinforced after a first-up loss to GWS, the Magpies are now premiership favourites. They have lost only one game since, and that was to Geelong by three points. Nick Daicos, despite some heavy tags, is averaging almost 30 disposals per game; brother Josh Daicos is not far behind in a new role at halfback. Ruckman Darcy Cameron is also in All-Australian calculations, while veterans Scott Pendlebury, Jeremy Howe and Steele Sidebottom are playing as if they are in their mid-20s. Forwards Jamie Elliott, Brodie Mihocek and Bobby Hill are getting the job done, while Tim Membrey, Harry Perryman and Dan Houston have been excellent additions. Ned Long has been the feel-good story of the season. The list goes on. Still getting it done: Nick Daicos was shadowed by Ed Langdon during the King\u2019s Birthday clash, but still had a major impact. Credit: Getty Images Who\u2019s not: Jordan de Goey has managed only five games because of injury (groin and now Achilles), and he clearly lacked his typical zest in those games. He remains the Magpies\u2019 x-factor, particularly when the September stage rolls around and a bull with dash and flare is needed. If he cannot reclaim full fitness, and therefore maximum on-field impact, the Magpies may fall just short. Mason Cox has been in and out of the team, and faces an uncertain future, particularly with Daniel McStay keen to make his presence felt inside attacking 50. Verdict: A record of 11 wins from their past 12 games should only get better immediately after the bye when the Magpies have three-straight games against bottom-half teams \u2013 St Kilda, West Coast and Carlton. Barring a major mishap, they will finish top two, and have potentially all of their finals at the MCG. Their injury list will also improve, with Brayden Maynard (foot) a chance to return against the Saints, with De Goey and Lachie Schultz (hamstring) to be given time to be at peak fitness. Coach Craig McRae has his men playing a considered brand of football, with the Magpies arguably the best team using the ball forward of centre. And, when it comes to close games, there is no better side at plucking victory. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: A\n\nRichmond (17th, 3 wins, 10 losses) Who\u2019s hot: Captain Toby Nankervis has been sterling in a young team needing their senior players to show the way. His work in the ruck has been tireless, and his physicality has allowed the Tiger cubs to walk taller. Nick Vlastuin, another from their premiership era, has held firm in a backline that has had much to do. Midfield pair Tim Taranto and Jacob Hopper have also stepped up to play key roles in the Tigers\u2019 rare victories. Much has been made of the Tigers\u2019 bevy of high draft picks, but it\u2019s the Tasmanian from the rookie list, Seth Campbell, who has caught the eye the most with his pressure and nous around goals. His celebratory somersault after kicking the sealer against Carlton in round one will live long in the memories of the Richmond faithful. Who\u2019s not: Noah Balta owes his club big time. Just two months after signing a mammoth seven-year contract extension, the key defender assaulted a man in a NSW car park. As a result of the club-imposed sanction and the curfew ordered by the magistrate, Balta has played just five out of 13 games in a season when the Tigers need his experience. It\u2019s a big final three months of the season for Dion Prestia, who has managed only 15 of 36 games since the start of last year due to a series of injuries. The 32-year-old won\u2019t be part of the Tigers\u2019 next finals team but can play an important buffering role while prized picks Sam Lalor and Josh Smillie cut their teeth at the top level. The verdict: As tough as it may be for Tigers fans to watch their side lose most weeks, even the harshest judge would be encouraged by the progress made so early in their rebuild. While the exodus of mature-age talent was supposed to result in the reigning wooden-spooner plumbing deeper lows, the arrival of fresh blood who actually want to be there has seen the Tigers already improve on their two wins. With games to come against Essendon, West Coast (away), St Kilda and North Melbourne, they should be able to pick up another one or two wins to nourish the soul without much damage to their draft hand. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: C+\n\nGold Coast Suns (5th, 8 wins, 4 losses) Who\u2019s hot: Well, it\u2019s finally getting hot for the Suns where it really counts \u2013 on the ladder. They are primed to play finals for the first time in club history \u2013 but, yes, we have said that before, and a challenging run home to September awaits. This time, though, Damien Hardwick has his team playing a robust brand of football that should stand up when it counts. New skipper Noah Anderson is in All-Australian form, while Matt Rowell has added more run to his game. The Suns are giving Rowell time to sign a contract extension, but it\u2019s a major worry the Victorian, with several suitors, has yet to do so. Perhaps that changes soon after the bye. Touk Miller is another midfielder pressing for All-Australian selection, while defender Sam Collins and mid-sized forward Ben Long would be locks for that team were it picked now. Key forward Ben King would also be close. Recruits Daniel Rioli and John Noble have done what was expected \u2013 provide dash and creativity from halfback. On our way: Matt Rowell and Ben King have had strong starts to the season, helping the Suns eye a maiden finals berth. Credit: Getty Images Who\u2019s not: Half-back flanker Connor Budarick has been in and out of the team and has not played at the senior level since the loss to the Lions. While Rioli and Noble enjoy the rebound accolades in defensive 50, a firing Budarick would also help. As Hardwick has noted, the Suns need to stop kicking to King when he is outnumbered. King had 23 goals in his first six games, the 24-year-old has 10 in his past six games. It\u2019s over to Ethan Read, Jed Walter and Ned Moyle to get busy. The verdict: The Suns likely need only five more wins to book a September berth, but face a potentially tough month after the break \u2013 GWS [Engie Stadium], Melbourne [People First Stadium], Essendon [Marvel Stadium] and Collingwood [People First Stadium]. Richmond [in round 21] appears their only certain win in the run home, but if they are good enough, they will make the finals. Their game plan is strong \u2013 they are among the best teams for points from turnovers, intercepts and stoppages, and know how to lock the ball inside their forward-half. It\u2019s about time the Suns broke their finals duck \u2013 we\u2019re backing Hardwick in.\n\nJon Pierik\u2019s grade: B Sydney (13th, 5 wins, 8 losses) Who\u2019s hot: Twelve months ago, the Swans were flag favourites and Isaac Heeney the top pick to win the Brownlow. That\u2019s not the case now, but Heeney remains their best-performed player. The gun midfielder is on track for similar numbers to his career-best 2024 but is lacking the same impact. The same could be said of Chad Warner, whose form has improved since the distraction of being out of contract was removed. Tagger James Jordon can count midfield stars Sam Walsh and Zach Merrett among his scalps. Youngster Matt Roberts continues to grow as a running defender, backing up his rapid improvement from last year. Who\u2019s not: An All Australian halfback last year, Nick Blakey is struggling with the extra attention on him. Injuries have forced the Swans to play him deeper, limiting his capacity to provide the springboard from defence that was a feature of their game last year. Ollie Florent paid the price for the Swans\u2019 poor form, his recent omission ending a run of 130 consecutive games. Hayden McLean is another from their grand final team who has also been dropped this year as the Swans search for marking power in their weakened forward line. Now that he is fit after a wretched 18 months with injury, skipper Callum Mills has the chance in the second half of the season to remind his critics why the club made him captain. Verdict: Injuries have wreaked havoc with rookie coach Dean Cox\u2019s first season at the helm. All Australians Errol Gulden, Tom Papley, Mills have all spent chunks of the season injured, as have reliable defender Harry Cunningham and young key forward Logan McDonald. Throw them all into the Swans\u2019 23, and it\u2019s unlikely they would be in such a desperate position. The crowded casualty ward has exposed a lack of depth. That said, the Swans have been so poor in several games that it would not have mattered who they had on the park. A fitter list raises hope they can mount a charge for the finals, but they are coming from a long way back.\n\nAndrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport are sent every Monday. Sign up for our Sport newsletter. Teams who had the bye in round 13 St Kilda (11th, five wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nJack Higgins has been a consistent force up forward, the small forward leading the Saints\u2019 goal kicking \u2013 including four goals against Geelong \u2013 to be included in the All-Australian preliminary squad. Jack Sinclair (27 disposals per game) and Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera (28) have been two of the premier rebounding half-backs. The dashing Wanganeen-Milera, off-contract and weighing up offers to return home to South Australia, has become the Saints\u2019 most important player, and the best player they have had in the past decade. That he has yet to agree to a contract extension by this point of the season is a major worry for the Saints. Former Western Bulldog Jack Macrae has been a strong leader through the midfield and found plenty of the ball (before a major lung injury), while intercept defender Callum Wilkie should be in All-Australian squad discussions. Youngster Hugo Garcia is making progress, despite a public spray from Ross Lyon during the loss to Brisbane and recent axing to the VFL. Marcus Windhager, one of several off-contract Saints, has, at times, been a stand-out, whether tagging or finding his own ball.\n\nCookin\u2019: Jack Higgins has had a strong season, and will be in All-Australian squad calculations. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Who\u2019s not?\n\nYoung midfielder Darcy Wilson has stagnated, while Mattaes Phillipou has endured an injury-hit start to the season, the latest a calf injury in the opening minutes against Melbourne. Wingman Brad Hill still provides dash, but there are times when he could rip a game open. Rowan Marshall has been steady, but is no longer among the conversation as one of the top three ruckmen in the league. Injuries to Max King and Zaine Cordy have hurt. Verdict: The Saints are 2-4 against top-eight teams, including their best win of the season, against Geelong. They are a system-based side, so, when the system wobbles, the whole team wobbles, which can lead to heavy defeats. The flip side is what we saw against Melbourne, when they dominated through scores from defence. That they are the only team to lose to the last-placed Eagles highlights the gulf between their worst and best. The Saints still remain a line-ball finals contender, as they were before this campaign began. Through that prism, they sit where many had expected. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: C+ Man on a mission: Caleb Serong has been influential for the Dockers this season. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nFremantle (eighth, seven wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nMidfield gun Caleb Serong (28 disposals per game) typically finds plenty of the ball, but has struggled, at times, when there has been an aggressive tag. Fellow star onballer Andrew Brayshaw (also 28 disposals per game) has been busy, and put his body on the line in the desperate final minutes against Gold Coast on Saturday, and is also firmly in contention for All-Australian selection. Jordan Clark has provided drive from half-back, Shai Bolton has added life inside attacking 50 and been arguably the second-best recruit of the season (behind Bailey Smith), while Luke Jackson has been at his best when used as a sole ruckman. The Dockers have been one of the more efficient teams, according to Champion Data, but need to find more marks inside 50 if they are to challenge for a top-four spot. Loading Who\u2019s not?\n\nSean Darcy, tied to the club until the end of 2030, has largely been a shadow of his former self because of an off-season hampered by a knee issue but was strong in ruck contests in the wet against the Suns. Whether he and Jackson can thrive in the same team remains a burning question for coach Justin Longmuir. It also remains to be seen if talls Josh Treacy, Jye Amiss and Pat Voss can consistently also work alongside each other up forward, as the Dockers have struggled to turn inside-50 advantage into scores. That could also be because of a lack of speed with ball in hand, something the Dockers have looked to address. It was great to see Nat Fyfe back for his first senior game of the season last weekend. Hayden Young\u2019s extended absence because of a serious hamstring injury which has required surgery has hurt. He shapes as an x-factor later in the season. Verdict: The Dockers remain an enigma. They have a list capable of finishing in the top four, reinforced by their win on the Gold Coast and their three wins in five games against top-eight teams, but have had head-shaking losses, including a 61-point defeat to St Kilda at Marvel Stadium, and a 14-point loss at home to a depleted Collingwood. The pressure remains on Longmuir to deliver a deep finals run.\n\nJon Pierik\u2019s grade: B- Teams who had the bye in round 12 Carlton (12th, four wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nIn his 10th season, Jack Silvagni has been a revelation in his new role as a defender. Silvagni\u2019s ability to stop high-quality forwards, from a key type like Aaron Naughton to the medium-sized threat like Patrick Dangerfield, intercept and launch counter-attacks is one of the reasons why the Blues, for all their problems, has been one of the more difficult sides to score against. A streamlined George Hewett is having a career-best season in the midfield at the age of 29, and Nick Haynes has overcome a horror start to life as a Blue by turning the clock back to the pre-pandemic years. Tom De Koning was the best ruck in the competition in the first month, but his form has tailed off. Jacob Weitering had been in All-Australian form before two below-par games coming into the bye. Jack Silvagni has been a revelation in defence for the Blues so far this season. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nWho\u2019s not?\n\nThe Blues need more from their superstars. Patrick Cripps and Charlie Curnow are having reasonable years but are capable of finding another level. Harry McKay has struggled with consistency since returning from a mental health break, though his best has been the reason why the Blues have won. After another interrupted preseason, Sam Walsh has become just a player, unable to run opponents off their legs like he used to. The same can be said of Blake Acres, who is not having the same impact of his first two years at the club. Verdict: So much more was expected of the Blues, who have been one of the most disappointing clubs of the season. Despite having two Coleman medallists in their forward line the Blues are having enormous difficulties scoring. Their lack of class small forwards has hurt, but their ball movement is slow and imprecise. They are as tense as a patient visiting the dentist. Similar problems were overcome in 2023 when they mounted a stunning run to the preliminary final, but they do not have the same quality on their list. A friendly draw over the next month will give Blues fans hope but a finals berth is unlikely. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ Tristan Xerri is mounting a case for All-Australian selection this year. Credit: Getty Images North Melbourne (17th, two wins, one draw, eight losses)\n\nWho\u2019s hot?\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Tristan Xerri is again mounting a strong claim for a maiden All-Australian blazer. The ruckman, with his attack on the ball and wholehearted manner in which he plays, has become the Kangaroos\u2019 on-field spiritual leader. Small forward Paul Curtis has continued his improvement and, with 19 goals to the bye, is on track to pass his career-best haul of 30 last year. Cameron Zurhaar has rediscovered his bull-at-a-gate ways in attack to add much-needed bite to the forward line. Veteran Luke Parker has justified his acquisition on the field even if his greatest impact might be felt in the locker room. Who\u2019s not?\n\nThis might be harsh on North\u2019s leading possession-getter but Caleb Daniel is not having the impact he should. A damaging kick at his best, Daniel has often erred on the side of recklessness with his ball use by taking low-percentage options deep in defence. In his third year at Arden Street, Griffin Logue cannot get a clear run at it due to injury and now form. Dropped amid North\u2019s horror run, Logue is yet to reclaim his position in the side. The Roos need more from experienced duo Aidan Corr and Zac Fisher, who have both had stints in the VFL. Caleb Daniel: Plenty of possessions but more impact needed. Credit: Getty Images Verdict: As painful as this season has been for their fans, North have actually improved. At this stage last year, they were winless with a percentage of 55.9 and uncompetitive. This year, they have been in contention at three-quarter-time in eight games. The question is whether North should be further advanced after five seasons in the bottom two. Given they have traded away their first pick, the Kangaroos would have expected to have picked up an extra win or two instead of being in the familiar position of 17th.\n\nAndrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ Port Adelaide (15th, four wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nPort\u2019s best phase of the season came after Zak Butters returned from injury. Butters was instrumental in Port\u2019s best win of the year, against Hawthorn, but needs more help in the guts. The Power cannot afford to lose him. Moved to half-back, Connor Rozee has maintained his high standards while others\u2019 have fallen, though Port need him in the middle as well as providing run out of defence. Though not necessarily built for it, Mitch Georgiades has prospered being the main man in the forward 50. Miles Bergman\u2019s star is on the rise though he, like Butters, may be on the move at season\u2019s end. Who\u2019s not?\n\nEsava Ratugolea, Ivan Soldo, and Jordon Sweet were recruited at the end of 2023 to help Port take the next step. Eighteen months on, those moves have not had the desired effect. Ratugolea is struggling in an overworked defence that does not get enough pressure on the ball from up the field. Sweet lost his spot after being monstered by Tim English, and his understudy Soldo is out of favour. The move of Jeremy Finlayson into defence lasted just one disastrous game against Collingwood. Ed Richards has been a midfield weapon for the Western Bulldogs. Credit: Getty Images\n\nVerdict: Ken Hinkley\u2019s 13th and final season at the helm at Alberton is headed for an inglorious finish. Preliminary finalists last year, Port are headed for a bottom-six finish. The impending handover from Hinkley to Josh Carr is an easy target to explain Port\u2019s poor season even though many had tipped them to be this season\u2019s slider. The club would not have seen such a drop coming, given they traded out their first-round pick for Jack Lukosius, who has been injured. Most concerning is how quickly the Power have waved the white flag when things became difficult. Five of the heaviest losses of the Hinkley era have come in Port\u2019s last 24 games. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: E Western Bulldogs (seventh, six wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nEd Richards has morphed from a capable half-back into one of the game\u2019s best midfielders in the past 12 months. Richards\u2019 speed and penetrating left foot makes him a major weapon for the Dogs. Rebounding defender Bailey Dale, who had a career-best 49 possessions a fortnight ago, is on track for a second All-Australian blazer. Tom Liberatore is defying Father Time. Small forward Rhylee West is one of the most improved players in the league, thriving since taking over from the injured Cody Weightman. Matt Kennedy is close to the recruit of the year since his move from Carlton, revelling as a midfielder who can also be dangerous when moved forward.",

    "text": "Are airlines responsible for notifying me if they change flight routes after a ticket has been booked? A natural consequence of rerouting a flight\u2019s course is an altered flight duration, either due to delays to control air traffic congestion or distance covered; flydubai\u2019s flights from Dubai to Moscow, for example, now route further east through Pakistan and Afghanistan instead of Iran, increasing flight time from roughly five hours to seven. Loading This means if you have booked a tight layover, you may have to rethink your itinerary \u2013 and it\u2019s worth noting that air traffic control may request a pilot follow an alternative route when the plane is already in the air. If you\u2019re flying the same airline all the way to Europe via the Middle East or elsewhere with a stop, on the same ticket, the airline should make arrangements for you to make your connection or get you on the next available flight if you miss it. According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), airline conditions of carriage do not include flight time guarantees, and it should not be assumed by consumers that a plane\u2019s exact advertised schedule will be met. They are, however, generally expected to notify passengers in a timely manner of changes to the flight schedule, which includes significant route changes.\n\n\u201cAirlines should be proactive and truthful in telling consumers the reasons a flight is delayed or cancelled,\u201d the ACCC says. \u201cThey should also tell consumers what compensation they may be entitled to under both the airline\u2019s policy and the consumer guarantees.\u201d Compensation and assistance from airlines may differ and depends on whether the delay or cancellation was within the carrier\u2019s control. Some travel insurance policies cover cancelling or rearranging flights due to natural disasters, severe weather, conflicts or terrorist incidents, though it depends on the specific policy\u2019s force majeure events clause. Some policies, for example, may only partially cover or exclude pandemics, epidemics, government-imposed travel restrictions and acts of war altogether. It\u2019s worth reviewing your product disclosure statement before travelling, and keeping this in mind when browsing cover options. What\u2019s the best source of information on travel safety for Australians? Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade uses Smartraveller for its official travel advisories, regularly updating each destination\u2019s risk and safety issues on the website. It\u2019s generally considered the most reliable source of safety information for Australian travellers.\n\nIn 2019, Smartraveller discontinued its pre-trip registration service. Instead, Australians travelling overseas are encouraged to subscribe to travel advice updates for specific destinations, which are sent every 24 hours via email. Loading In a crisis, Smartraveller may open a registration portal for destinations affected. At present, Australian citizens and permanent residents in Israel, Iran and Occupied Palestinian Territories who want to leave are encouraged to register with Smartraveller. As of June 20, almost 3000 Australians had registered to be evacuated out of Israel and Iran, with the Australian embassy in Tehran closing and Australian Defence Force personnel sent in to assist with evacuations. \u201cWe urge Australians who are able to leave Iran to do so now,\u201d Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a press conference on June 20. On June 19, travel advice to Australians in Iran was to travel to borders so they can leave the country.\n\nSome Australians in Iran, however, have been critical of the federal government\u2019s response. Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories also have a do not travel alert. What should I do if disaster strikes while I\u2019m on holiday? Those overseas who need immediate assistance from the Australian government are encouraged to contact the Consular Emergency Centre, which can be contacted 24/7 on +61 2 6261 3305 from anywhere in the world. It\u2019s also advised to search, memorise, physically write down and save in your phone the specific emergency services number for each of your travel destinations. Dialling triple zero while overseas will not connect you to local emergency services, though dialling 112 in most countries will redirect you to their local emergency services. Your basic pre-departure checklist, including the documents you need to have with you Confirm your passport\u2019s validity for at least six months from your trip\u2019s planned end date\n\nSecure the right visa for countries you\u2019re visiting and transiting through\n\nConfirm your flight and accommodation bookings, checking for any delays, changes, or what they accessibility services they offer. This may require contacting providers directly\n\nIf driving overseas, check if you need an international driving permit in addition to your Australian driver\u2019s licence\n\nGet a letter from your doctor and copies of your prescription for any medication you\u2019ll be taking with you, and check it\u2019s legal and available at your destination\n\nCheck what vaccinations are required for entry, and if the border requires proof you\u2019ve had them\n\nPurchase comprehensive travel insurance for yourself and your belongings, checking policies cover any planned activities beyond the basics\n\nMake physical and digital copies of all of the above documents, plus flight and accommodation information, for yourself and all travellers in your party, including babies and children. Store these separately from your original documents, and consider sharing a copy of your personal and travel documents, including your itinerary with flight information, with a trusted contact at home\n\nIf travelling with children who don\u2019t share your surname, you may need to bring documentation proving your relationship with them, such as birth certificates, adoption papers or custody papers\n\nNotify your bank and credit card companies about your travel dates and destinations. Some banks, such as ING, allow you to do this in their mobile app. It\u2019s generally wise to carry a small amount of cash for emergencies\n\nWhat about before I fly? What should be on my pre-departure to-do list? Travel requirements and destination-specific laws and advice may change with short notice, which may change your basic pre-departure to-do list. In general, it\u2019s advised to regularly check with the embassy or consulate of your planned destinations before every trip to see if visa conditions and medical requirements have changed. It\u2019s also advised to get a basic health check at least eight weeks before departure, and get the recommended vaccinations. Some countries require proof of immunisation against certain infectious diseases before entry, and some vaccines, such as the rabies vaccine, require multiple doses over multiple weeks. What do I need to know about travelling to the United States from Australia? The recent case of Australian writer Alistair Kitchen \u2013 who says he was detained and questioned for 12 hours by American border officials about his involvement in pro-Palestine activity, before being deported \u2013 has implications for Australians travelling to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program.\n\nThe Visa Waiver Program means Australians can access a fast-tracked system to apply for an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) pass, which, when approved, allows travellers to stay in the United States for up to 90 days without applying for a visa. When applying for your ESTA, be sure to use the official US government site, as there are many scam sites that will overcharge you for the service. Approved ESTA passes do not guarantee entry into the United States, however, and does not provide you with access to legal advice or much protection over digital devices if you\u2019re stopped at the border. Travellers also have to supply their social media handles during the ESTA application process. The application process for actual visas \u2013 B-1 for business and B-2 for recreation \u2013 is longer, with vetting including an interview at the United States consulate in Australia. It does mean that you would be likely to know you\u2019re going to be denied entry before boarding the plane, however, holding a B-1 or B-2 visa still does not guarantee you entry. Smartraveller says: \u201cUS authorities have broad powers to decide if you\u2019re eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law\u201d. They have the ability to detain, question and search passengers and their belongings, including digital devices, without having to supply evidence a crime has occurred. Following incidents where individuals have reported having their phones searched at the US border, it could be worth considering deleting social media apps off your phone before your flight, ensuring it\u2019s protected with a strong password, and, for iPhone users, enabling Lockdown Mode.",

    "text": "Fitz: What is it? Torvill: Bolero is obviously a very special routine because it opened the door for the future, and we wouldn\u2019t still be doing what we\u2019re doing without that. Fitz: So let\u2019s go back to the romance one! The personal chemistry and physical intimacy that you two display on ice as you dance is so wonderful; it dinkum is amazing that you can do it without ever having been a couple. Was there never a time, Chris, when you said to Jayne, surely, \u201cLet\u2019s go and see a film Saturday night?\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, forget it.\u201d Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean on the Our Last Dance tour in Perth this month. Credit: Alfie Hitchcock Dean: No, never like that. We have spent a lot of time together, seeing movies, going for drinks, and the theatre, all of those things. And of course, we\u2019ve been together on many long tours, like when we were touring Australia for the first time. We were meant to be coming for just two weeks, but ended up staying for three months doing shows, and then stayed a further nine months putting a show together. So we were in Sydney area for almost a year, and we made lots of friends.\n\nJayne Torvill and Christopher Dean kiss during their famous \u201cBolero\u201d routine at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. They racked up an unprecedented 12 perfect scores to win the gold medal for this performance. Credit: David Caulkin/ AP Fitz: [Painfully persisting] So never in that year, two young English athletes a long way from home, did you exchange smouldering looks over your Vegemite on toast ... Torvill: No, our main focus was getting the work done. You know, we had just turned professional, and for us, it was an exciting time in that we weren\u2019t competing any more, and we didn\u2019t have any rules and regulations of competition. So, in fact, you know, we were free to be more creative, which is something that we\u2019ve always enjoyed. Fitz: What about blues, then? There must have come a time over the last 45 years when you two were dancing, when Chris lifted you up, Jayne, so you could do a twirly gig and the booger didn\u2019t catch you properly? Surely, there must have been times where, to use the Australian expression, you came an absolute cropper, occasioning strong words? Torvill: No. Lucky for us, we never did have any major falls in competition, which is what counts. Falls in training, you accept. But we trained so hard that to be ready for anything, that we didn\u2019t really make any mistakes. So, no \u201cblues\u201d.\n\nFitz: Moving on! By some reckoning, the pop group ABBA was said to be a bigger success in Australia, even than in Sweden. There was something about ABBA that Australia, more than pretty much any other country, loved. Is it possible that the same applies to you two \u2013 that Australia loves Torvill and Dean more than even Britain loves Torvill and Dean, and that we loved you more than anywhere else on Earth. Dean: Maybe. When we first came to Australia, it was such a surprise for us to be so welcomed. The Australian promoter had pre-booked the Russian Olympic figure-skating team, thinking that they would win everything at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics, and they didn\u2019t. We did. And so the promoter said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get those bloody Poms down here\u201d. And so within a very short time, somebody came over to see us and gave us a contract, and we came down to Australia and we were adored. I mean, they tell the story of when the tickets first went on sale, that the line instantly formed up right round the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Torvill & Dean at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in January 1989. Credit: Fairfax Media Fitz: Which is very odd, yes? Because in Sydney, we\u2019re surfers, netballers, cricketers, footballers, but not really, as a people, ice skaters \u2013 with only a rink or two open on a good day? Dean: Yeah, I think what happened, Channel Nine were the host broadcasters at the Olympics, and we became very popular because they gave us a lot of air time. And we became the base of promoting the Winter Olympics in Australia. And there were also a lot of British expats who took to us, right?\n\nFitz: Whatever else, our love affair with you has been enduring. We also have a saying that a person has had \u201cmore comebacks than Dame Nellie Melba\u201d, lately replaced by \u201cmore farewell tours than Johnny Farnham\u201d. Whoever, with you two, came up with the title for your tour, Our Last Dance, has to be commended because it captures the imagination. But seriously, seriously, when you perform your last dance in Sydney [at Qudos on Sunday afternoon], when you come off the ice, is that really going to be it for you two? Your last dance? Dean: It will certainly be our last performance skating in Australia. But then we go back to Nottingham, our hometown, and we actually do four performances there, and then on the last day, that will be our last skating performance, live skating performance, that we will do. You know, we\u2019ve been skating together now for 50 years, and we think that that\u2019s a good round number to sort of call it a day from the performing side. And the body is ready to say it\u2019s time as well. Fitz: But don\u2019t you think that five years from now, one of you might say, \u201cI\u2019m in your town, I\u2019m going to put on a red wig. You put on a blonde one, and I\u2019ll see you down at the rink, and just one last time in the moonlight, let\u2019s dance?\u201d Torvill: It\u2019s not to say that we won\u2019t ever skate on the ice together, but we won\u2019t actually be performing together. So we may be together like choreographing or teaching somebody. We\u2019ll do other things together, but just not performing. This is it. Fitz: Chris? Don\u2019t you think that you might just do it one more time in the moonlight, when you\u2019re 80, one more time to capture the magic, one more time without anybody knowing, just the two of you?\n\nDean: [Thoughtfully] I\u2019m not saying that we won\u2019t do that ... but it\u2019s not something that we would show off to anybody ... It would be personal. Fitz: Bingo! Now, without being too mealy-mouthed about it, your dancing ability on ice must be comparable, in terms of how much it\u2019s celebrated, to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Did you two ever watch footage of their dancing and swoon? T & D: Yes! Dean: They were very much a part of our viewing, and we took a lot from them in their style and the movement and their performance quality. Yeah, absolutely, they were our idols. Fitz: You mentioned that you two have been doing it for 50 years. That means \u2013 dot three, carry one, subtract two \u2013 you must have started in the mid-\u203270s. How much have your physical abilities waned? Are there many things you used to be able to do that you simply cannot do now?\n\nTorvill: There are things that have got harder as we got older, and we\u2019re no longer 25, but we still feel that we can put on a show that we\u2019re happy with. And we\u2019ve put it together with some amazing [younger] skaters from around the world. So we\u2019re really excited by the show, and the show itself tells a story, our story, right from the beginning up until now. Loading Fitz: When Mick Jagger was 23 years old, he said, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not still singing Can\u2019t Get No Satisfaction when I\u2019m 30\u201d. Could you two have conceived that you\u2019d still be going 50 years later? And would you have been thrilled? Torvill: No and yes. We would never have imagined it would have been possible. Back then, when skaters turned professional, they would maybe do two years, three years in a professional show, and then, you know, sort of maybe go into teaching or just retire anyway. We\u2019ve just been so lucky with the way things happened for us \u2013 that we were able to create several different tours, and then go back to the Olympics in \u201994 because that became a possibility, and that extended our professional careers. Dean: And then, in more recent times, television people came and said, would we be interested in teaching celebrities to skate? And that\u2019s when Dancing on Ice was born. And that extended us, too.\n\nFitz: All right, one last question. I\u2019ve got two tragically proud boasts in my life. The first is that I was once sent off against the All Blacks for violence. The second is that I have danced on ice with Torvill & Dean. I shot a story for Channel Nine\u2019s Today Show in the early \u201990s, which involved me skating around with you two. Do you two happen to remember it? Torvill. [Uncertainly] No, I don\u2019t remember it. Because we\u2019ve had a number of occasions, Peter, where we\u2019ve skated around with a presenter, a program or a journalist ... Fitz: [Brightly] I was the one where you looked at me, Jayne, with the expression of \u201cHow has it come to this? I am on the ice with a rhinoceros ...\u201d Torvill: No ...",

Source: AAP / Joel Carrett With details about the accuracy of the technologies tested left for later release, experts are wary of the trial's initial claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Angus is a professor of digital communication at the Queensland University of Technology and the director of its Digital Media Research Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the key concerns that we have is how the industry often will inflate their accuracy and the utility of these approaches when we know that there are still significant issues when it comes to both gender and also racial biases, but also the general lack of efficacy of these approaches,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Department of Communications, a government-commissioned report from the Social Research Centre found nearly nine in 10 adults were supportive of age assurance measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly two of those 10 had heard of at least one potential method to check a person's age online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis research shows Australians widely support our world-leading age restrictions on social media for under 16s and have strong expectations of platforms when it comes to data protection and security,\" Communications Minister Anika Wells said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAustralians could be 'in for a rude shock'\n\nAngus says the general public has not been adequately informed about the likely impacts of these technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Australians are in for a very rude shock when this actually perhaps, gets implemented, and they all of a sudden are being forced to hand over [their] data to access services that they've freely been able to access up to this point,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's absolutely everything you would expect to find in the midst of a moral panic where people have been sucked along with this idea that, 'Yeah, this thing is really, really bad and we need to prevent it,' but have not stopped to think critically about this, and then not been properly informed about the fullness of that risk.\"\n\n\n\nJohn Pane, chair of digital rights organisation Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA), is a member of the stakeholder advisory board for the trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the EFA has \"concerns about the rollout of this technology because it's not simply about restricting access to social media platforms for children 15 and under\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It requires all adults who participate in the online environment, who wish to access social media platforms to either have their age authenticated or establish their identity as a means of, or part of that age authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So from our perspective, it's the Trojan horse for getting people to get used to providing more and more credentials online.\"\n\n\n\n'A really good start'\n\nAmid these concerns, some remain supportive of the ban, including Kirra Pendergast, another member of the stakeholder advisory board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Initially, I was only against the ban purely because of the technical workarounds that are possible for some kids who are more technical than others,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But after having lots of conversations with parents in particular, it became abundantly clear that the ban was making parents have a conversation that we've needed to have for a very, very long time.\"\n\n\n\nPendergast is the founder of Safe on Social, an online safety advisory group for schools and businesses, and chief digital safety strategist at the global Ctrl+Shft Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I get contacted almost every single day by parents that are struggling with this,\" the cybersecurity expert said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They don't know how to say no.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPendergast said parents and educators would have \"a lot more time to get it right\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like all aspects of technical security, cybersecurity, and cyber safety. It's never ever going to be 100 per cent. This is never going to be the silver bullet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a really, really good start because, again, it sparked all of the conversations that we needed to have at every level of society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Tama Leaver, an internet studies academic at Curtin University and the chief investigator in the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child, says the ban responds to a \"very real fear that parents have that social media is an unknown space\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If this is world-leading, we need to be quite clear on what the legislation is actually doing.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia is the first country to try to implement a teen social media ban. Source: AAP / Dean Lewins He warned that the implementation of the policy may not address all the issues that have been discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some harms, for example, such as cyberbullying, were very much touted as one of the big problems to be solved,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is nothing in this legislation that addresses cyberbullying meaningfully at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This at best addresses algorithmic amplification \u2026 of young people's experiences of social media, but \u2026 we expect from what's been said already that most messaging apps are exempt from this legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, the spaces where we imagine cyberbullying is most likely to happen are not being touched by this legislation at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaver was a signatory on an open letter from more than 140 academics and civil society organisations against the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the rest of the world is watching Australia and hoping that this might be a blueprint, we're going to have an awful lot of work to do in the next few months to actually have a blueprint to practically do this rather than simply aspire to giving parents some reassurance,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nNuha Abdul Razaq arrived in Australia from Iraq as a refugee in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the topic of suicide is something many from the Arabic-speaking community find especially difficult to talk about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a topic which they never talk about it in our country. When I was in Iraq or many people, I have clients from Syria, from different countries, from Lebanon or from Jordan, maybe we didn't talk it, we didn't talk about suicide in our countries. It's like, some people they feel it's shameful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe now delivers suicide prevention workshops in Arabic for refugees and asylum seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workshops are part of a program launched by Wesley LifeForce which provides training in suicide prevention in six languages: Arabic, Dari, Farsi, Karen, Khmer and Tamil.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's co-designed with survivors of torture, trauma and forced displacement, paired up with the program by an organisation called Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors - STARTTS.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Abdul Razaq says the success of the training is in large part because it's delivered by people like herself who understand the challenges and stresses of displacement and resettlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To move to another country, it's not easy. Some people, they stay in camps for 10 years, 12 years, moving to other country, which is different languages, financial, most of them, they don't have any money to spend, even if they move to other country, if they want to find a job, it's struggling to get a job. And when you get settlement to Australia, another one, you have all (the) stress comes with you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent research shows refugees and asylum seekers in Australia experience disproportionately high rates of suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows between 2007\u20132020, humanitarian entrants to Australia were 1.7 times more likely to die by suicide compared to other permanent migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\nBethany Farley, the National Training Manager at Wesley Lifeforce, says the broader figures around mental wellbeing for refugees and asylum seekers are also deeply concerning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's reports that show that over 50% do actually report that they have poor mental health with more than 25% experiencing PTSD. There are some other reports around thoughts of suicide, which for men can be as high as 10% and for women can be as high as 17%.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy CEO of STARTTS Lachlan Murdoch says the trauma of war and displacement presents complex psychological challenges for refugees and asylum seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So being pushed out of your country in traumatic circumstances, exposure to conflict and war, being subjected to things like shelling and bombardment, in some cases being imprisoned and being held in circumstances of great deprivation. Experiences of torture. So all those things impact people in ways that affect their psyche. So refugees experience much higher levels of anxiety and depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says for asylums seekers, these experiences of trauma can be further complicated by fear of being returned to the country they have fled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Asylum seekers are in a situation where they're living in protracted uncertainty. And so there's not clarity for them about whether the person will remain in a situation of relative safety or could be returned to circumstances of danger. So that experience of uncertainty also compounds the traumatic effects of exposure to violence and to conflict.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Farley says these challenges are exacerbated by a lack of access to culturally appropriate care for refugees and asylum seekers arriving in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then you add the other challenges of a language barrier, not understanding how the processes work. And finding services that have translators or people that can actually understand the nuances of how their community and culture responds to different situations, to different processes. The mental health models themselves can be alienating in that they do not meet the needs of a multicultural community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suicide prevention training delivered by community members like Ms Abdul Razaq aims to address some of these issues by facilitating workshops where participants can share experiences in their own language and learn from each other about the supports available.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Abdul Razaq says the stigma attached to speaking about suicide was initially a barrier for her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And at the beginning I was stressed when I was trained for the first time and I hearing something, some information, but later I accepted that if that's happening in the community, we need all the community to know about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter delivering the first training session, she says she was inspired by the openness of the participants, and their ability to move past any shame they might associate with talking about suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nine women attended and it was very good and I liked the way they talk about it. They open their mouth and talk about their stories as well. And it's to build comfortable space between us and to build the trust between us. When they want to talk, they will talk in a normal way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know needs crisis support, contact Lifeline on 13 11 14, the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information and support with mental health is available at beyondblue.org.au and on 1300 22 4636.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Perth's property market has been gaining ground and is now on the cusp of a major milestone, according to Domain's latest forecast report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city's median house price is expected to reach $982,000 by June next year and cross $1 million by the end of 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the forecast plays out, it will join Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra, which also have million-dollar medians, according to Domain.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicola Powell, chief of research and economics at Domain, said Perth's growth is being fuelled by a mix of factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Perth's momentum is being driven by lower interest rates, high income growth and the strongest population growth out of any of the other capital cities,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Affordability is also less of a concern compared to the other cities, where residents have a lower mortgage-to-income ratio.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Home price heat: The city picking up pace as records tumble\n\nPowell said while affordability is a growing issue across the country, buyers in Perth typically face a lower mortgage burden compared to those in other cities, giving them more flexibility and helping to sustain demand.\n\n\n\nHouse prices rise across Australia\n\nAcross the rest of Australia, Domain forecasts house prices will continue to rise, although more steadily than during the pandemic-era boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney is expected to lead the charge, with a predicted 7 per cent increase over the next financial year, which would push its median house price to a record $1.83 million \u2014 a $112,000 jump in just one year. Melbourne is forecast to grow by 6 per cent to reach $1.11 million, fully recovering from its downturn.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisbane and Adelaide are also expected to reach new highs, with forecast growth rates of 5 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanberra is on track for a 4 per cent rise, bringing its median to $1.1 million, still below its 2022 peak but heading upward.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How Australia's slowing economy could affect your mortgage repayments\n\n\"The double-digit growth that we have seen out of cities like Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth in recent years has been spurred on by a variety of factors, including a chronic undersupply of housing, first home buyer support and relative affordability compared to cities like Sydney,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While prices will continue to rise across all capitals, the rate of growth in these cities will be slower than we've seen due to stretched affordability. Their previous relative value advantages have now decreased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Other factors that could cause downward pressure include elevated economic uncertainty, which impacts consumer confidence and demand for housing.\"\n\n\n\nWhat could impact prices?\n\nAccording to Powell, lower interest rates are also playing a key role in price growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has already cut rates by a total of 0.5 per cent in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell said markets are expecting a further 0.8 per cent in reductions by mid-2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the report notes there are not enough new homes being built to ease pressure, and while construction costs have started to level out, delays caused by labour shortages and planning bottlenecks are keeping supply tight.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The key changes homebuyers will need to keep an eye on in 2025\n\nDomain expects the national housing shortfall to continue well into 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the report highlights a continued undersupply of housing. While construction costs have started to stabilise, delays caused by labour shortages and planning hold-ups are slowing delivery. Domain expects the national housing shortfall to persist well into 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation growth is also forecast to slow slightly, including in Western Australia. While that may ease some pressure on demand, strong rental activity, rising wages and limited stock are likely to keep prices trending upward.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment support is another factor lifting demand. Expanded first-home buyer schemes, including the scrapping of lenders' mortgage insurance, are helping more people enter the market, particularly in more affordable areas, as per the report.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Technologies to enforce the Australian government's social media ban for under 16s are \"private, robust and effective\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's according to the preliminary findings of a federal government-commissioned trial that has nearly finished testing them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings, released on Friday, may give the government greater confidence to forge ahead with the ban, despite a suite of expert criticism.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey might also alleviate some of the concerns of the Australian population about privacy and security implications of the ban, which is due to start in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a report based on a survey of nearly 4,000 people and released by the government earlier this week found nine out of 10 people support the idea of a ban.\n\n\n\nBut it also found a large number of people were \"very concerned\" about how the ban would be implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 80 per cent of respondents had privacy and security concerns, while roughly half had concerns about age assurance accuracy and government oversight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trial's preliminary findings paint a rosy picture of the potential for available technologies to check people's ages.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, they contain very little detail about specific technologies, and appear to be at odds with what we know about age-assurance technology from other sources.\n\n\n\nFrom facial recognition to hand movement recognition\n\nThe social media ban for under-16s was legislated in December 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nA last-minute amendment to the law requires technology companies to provide \"alternative age assurance methods\" for account holders to confirm their age, rather than relying only on government-issued ID.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian government commissioned an independent trial to evaluate the \"effectiveness, maturity, and readiness for use\" of these alternative methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trial is being led by the Age Check Certification Scheme \u2014 a company based in the United Kingdom that specialises in testing and certifying identity verification systems.\n\n\n\nIt includes 53 vendors that offer a range of age assurance technologies to guess people's ages, using techniques such as facial recognition and hand-movement recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the preliminary findings of the trial, \"age assurance can be done in Australia\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trial's project director, Tony Allen, said \"there are no significant technological barriers\" to assuring people's ages online.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added the solutions are \"technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, these claims are hard to square with other evidence.\n\n\n\nThe social media ban for Australians under the age of 16 is set to come into effect in December. Source: AAP / PA / Yui Mok\n\nHigh error rates\n\nOn Thursday, the ABC reported the trial found face-scanning technologies \"repeatedly misidentified\" children as young as 15 as being in their 20s and 30s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tools could only guess children's ages \"within an 18-month range in 85 per cent of cases\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means a 14-year-old child might gain access to a social media account, while a 17-year-old might be blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is in line with results of global trials of face-scanning technologies conducted for more than a decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ongoing series of studies of age estimation technology by the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology shows the algorithms \"fail significantly when attempting to differentiate minors\" of various ages.\n\n\n\nThe tests also show that error rates are higher for young women compared to young men.\n\n\n\n\n\nError rates are also higher for people with darker skin tones.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese studies show that even the best age-estimation software currently available \u2014 Yoti \u2014 has an average error of 1.0 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther software options mistake someone's age by 3.1 years on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means, at best, a 16-year-old might be estimated to be 15 or 17 years old; at worst, they could be seen to be 13 or 19 years of age.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese error rates mean a significant number of children under 16 could access social media accounts despite a ban being in place, while some over 16 could be blocked.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Where's the harm? Experts, tech giants react to Australia's social media ban for under 16s SBS News 30/11/2024 03:37 Play\n\nYoti also explains businesses needing to check exact ages (such as 18) can set higher age thresholds (such as 25), so fewer people under 18 get through the age check.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach would be similar to that taken in Australia's retail liquor sector, where sales staff verify ID for anyone who appears to be under the age of 25.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, many young people lack the government-issued ID required for an additional age check.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also worth remembering that in August 2023, the Australian government acknowledged that the age assurance technology market was \"immature\" and could not yet meet key requirements, such as working reliably without circumvention and balancing privacy and security.\n\n\n\nOutstanding questions\n\nWe don't yet know exactly what methods platforms will use to verify account holders' ages.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile face-scanning technologies are often discussed, they could use other methods to confirm age.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government trial also tested voice and hand movements to guess young people's ages. But those methods also have accuracy issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's not yet clear what recourse people will have if their age is misidentified.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill parents be able to complain if children under 16 gain access to accounts, despite restrictions?\n\n\n\n\n\nWill older Australians who are incorrectly blocked be able to appeal? And if so, to whom?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other outstanding questions.\n\n\n\nWhat's stopping someone who's under 16 from getting someone who is over 16 to set up an account on their behalf?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the government might require all social media users to verify their age at regular intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also unclear what level of age estimation error the government may be willing to accept in implementing a social media ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legislation says technology companies must demonstrate they have taken \"reasonable steps\" to prevent under-16s from holding social media accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is considered \"reasonable\" is yet to be clearly defined.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians will have to wait until later this year for the full results of the government's trial to be released, and to know how technology companies will respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith less than six months until the ban comes into effect, social media users still don't have all the answers they need.\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa M.

    "text": "Hawthorn (Fifth, nine wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot: Jack Gunston has been on fire up forward, just when it seemed like he was destined to be a sub for much of the season, posting 28 goals and 13 goal assists. With Mitch Lewis and Calsher Dear on the comeback trail from injury, the Hawks needed Gunston desperately and he has delivered. Jai Newcombe has won plenty of the footy and played with his usual grunt, while Karl Amon continues to impress with his kicking skills and drive. Lloyd Meek fits perfectly as their ruckman, while the versatile Blake Hardwick has produced both in defence and as a stand-in forward. Jack Gunston of the Hawks celebrates a goal against Adelaide. Credit: AFL Photos Who\u2019s not: Will Day was on-track for the hot list until he suffered a stress fracture in his foot in April. The Hawks sorely miss his leadership and his ability to lift in key moments. They are a different side without him, and he\u2019s not due back until at least round 20. Jack Ginnivan was a match-winner for the Hawks last season but has been a little more inconsistent this campaign. Conor Nash has done well when on the field but his four-match ban for a late hit on Gryan Miers hurt the Hawks, who desperately missed his athleticism and versatility. The verdict: The Hawks are being graded on a much-higher curve this year, and they look like they have much more improvement left to come. They\u2019ve been unconvincing at times but have still won enough games to be within touch of the top four. Premierships aren\u2019t won in the first half of the season, but they can be lost through injuries and bad losses. Skipper James Sicily has battled injury, finally resting in the lead-up to the bye. His health, and how Day returns, will truly decide if this Hawks side pushes for a premiership, or fades out.\n\nRoy Ward\u2019s grade: B- Adelaide (Fourth, nine wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot: Jordan Dawson has been exceptional and should rank among the Brownlow contenders come season\u2019s end. He\u2019s a match-winner in the middle and a difference maker when pushing forward. Alex Neal-Bullen has made a big difference as a runner and ball-winner, while Ben Keays is approaching his best in a similar role. Riley Thilthorpe is approaching the peak of his powers as a key forward and contested mark option, and watch for Daniel Curtin \u2013 the tall wingman looks more dangerous with each game. Alex Neal-Bullen celebrates a goal with teammate Isaac Cumming. Credit: Getty Images Who\u2019s not: It\u2019s hard to find too many strugglers for the Crows but losing Matt Crouch to a hip injury for another four to six weeks hurts as he rates among their leaders in disposals while the onus will be on forwards Thilthorpe, Taylor Walker and Darcy Fogarty to convert their shots for goal and be as efficient as possible with scoring chances as that only becomes more important as the finals come around. Whether Nick Murray can return to a defensive role after a knee injury or whether Jordan Butts, Josh Worrell, Max Michalanney and Mark Keane retain those positions is also a watching brief.\n\nThe verdict: Aside from the early loss to Gold Coast, the Crows couldn\u2019t have asked for a better first half of the season. They are in the hunt for the top four, have the best percentage in the league and have relatively few serious injuries. Luck has been on the Crows\u2019 side in their wins over the Brisbane Lions and Port Adelaide. But they\u2019ve also made their own good fortune, with five wins by at least 60 points. Winning more away games and improving their defence will decide whether they are a real contender or fodder for the top sides. Roy Ward\u2019s grade: B+ West Coast Eagles (18th, one win, 13 losses) Who\u2019s hot: This is a tough question for a team that has just one win. But we are giving coach Andrew McQualter a break in his rookie season as he looks to implement a game plan that will turn this once-mighty club back around. Reuben Ginbey has shown good signs in defence, while midfielder Brady Hough looks promising. Recruits Liam Baker and Jack Graham have been solid, while Elijah Hewett has overcome injury to look like a long-term piece. Harley Reid is always in the spotlight, and has had bursts of brilliance, reinforcing why he will likely be the best player in the game down the track. He is averaging just under 18 disposals per game, and has nine goals for the season, but his ability to run out games remains an issue. Mid-season find Tom McCarthy was a standout against the Blues and shapes as a lock at halfback for the rest of the campaign. New boy: Eagles recruit Liam Baker, who won two premierships in his time with the Tigers, takes possession against his former team. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nWho\u2019s not: The Eagles, as a unit. When your coach rips you by declaring on national television that you have been \u201cpathetic in the contest\u201d, as McQualter said during quarter-time against the Blues last Sunday, that\u2019s a worry. Indeed, it\u2019s difficult not to say the Eagles have been pathetic for most of the season. Harsh? Perhaps. But look where they are sitting. Free-agent skipper Oscar Allen is hurt again, and may have played his last game for the club. Key forward Jake Waterman was already done for the year. Tim Kelly has openly discussed his motivational issues, due to the team\u2019s on-field woes. Elliot Yeo is injured and is yet to play a game this season. The Eagles do not have a frontline ruckman, and Reid\u2019s long-term future remains a daily talking point. Verdict: This was once a mighty, proud club (that is still a financial colossus) that had all teams fearful of coming to Perth, or when the Eagles arrived in town. It\u2019s been years since that was the case. They have just 11 wins since the start of the 2022 season, and major improvement appears years away. Ouch. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: E. Teams with the round 14 bye Collingwood (1st, 11 wins, 2 losses)\n\nWho\u2019s hot: That\u2019s an easy one to answer. The Magpies, as a collective, are. Having endured accusations they were too slow and old at the start of the season, these claims reinforced after a first-up loss to GWS, the Magpies are now premiership favourites. They have lost only one game since, and that was to Geelong by three points. Nick Daicos, despite some heavy tags, is averaging almost 30 disposals per game; brother Josh Daicos is not far behind in a new role at halfback. Ruckman Darcy Cameron is also in All-Australian calculations, while veterans Scott Pendlebury, Jeremy Howe and Steele Sidebottom are playing as if they are in their mid-20s. Forwards Jamie Elliott, Brodie Mihocek and Bobby Hill are getting the job done, while Tim Membrey, Harry Perryman and Dan Houston have been excellent additions. Ned Long has been the feel-good story of the season. The list goes on. Still getting it done: Nick Daicos was shadowed by Ed Langdon during the King\u2019s Birthday clash, but still had a major impact. Credit: Getty Images Who\u2019s not: Jordan de Goey has managed only five games because of injury (groin and now Achilles), and he clearly lacked his typical zest in those games. He remains the Magpies\u2019 x-factor, particularly when the September stage rolls around and a bull with dash and flare is needed. If he cannot reclaim full fitness, and therefore maximum on-field impact, the Magpies may fall just short. Mason Cox has been in and out of the team, and faces an uncertain future, particularly with Daniel McStay keen to make his presence felt inside attacking 50. Verdict: A record of 11 wins from their past 12 games should only get better immediately after the bye when the Magpies have three-straight games against bottom-half teams \u2013 St Kilda, West Coast and Carlton. Barring a major mishap, they will finish top two, and have potentially all of their finals at the MCG. Their injury list will also improve, with Brayden Maynard (foot) a chance to return against the Saints, with De Goey and Lachie Schultz (hamstring) to be given time to be at peak fitness. Coach Craig McRae has his men playing a considered brand of football, with the Magpies arguably the best team using the ball forward of centre. And, when it comes to close games, there is no better side at plucking victory. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: A\n\nRichmond (17th, 3 wins, 10 losses) Who\u2019s hot: Captain Toby Nankervis has been sterling in a young team needing their senior players to show the way. His work in the ruck has been tireless, and his physicality has allowed the Tiger cubs to walk taller. Nick Vlastuin, another from their premiership era, has held firm in a backline that has had much to do. Midfield pair Tim Taranto and Jacob Hopper have also stepped up to play key roles in the Tigers\u2019 rare victories. Much has been made of the Tigers\u2019 bevy of high draft picks, but it\u2019s the Tasmanian from the rookie list, Seth Campbell, who has caught the eye the most with his pressure and nous around goals. His celebratory somersault after kicking the sealer against Carlton in round one will live long in the memories of the Richmond faithful. Who\u2019s not: Noah Balta owes his club big time. Just two months after signing a mammoth seven-year contract extension, the key defender assaulted a man in a NSW car park. As a result of the club-imposed sanction and the curfew ordered by the magistrate, Balta has played just five out of 13 games in a season when the Tigers need his experience. It\u2019s a big final three months of the season for Dion Prestia, who has managed only 15 of 36 games since the start of last year due to a series of injuries. The 32-year-old won\u2019t be part of the Tigers\u2019 next finals team but can play an important buffering role while prized picks Sam Lalor and Josh Smillie cut their teeth at the top level. The verdict: As tough as it may be for Tigers fans to watch their side lose most weeks, even the harshest judge would be encouraged by the progress made so early in their rebuild. While the exodus of mature-age talent was supposed to result in the reigning wooden-spooner plumbing deeper lows, the arrival of fresh blood who actually want to be there has seen the Tigers already improve on their two wins. With games to come against Essendon, West Coast (away), St Kilda and North Melbourne, they should be able to pick up another one or two wins to nourish the soul without much damage to their draft hand. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: C+\n\nGold Coast Suns (5th, 8 wins, 4 losses) Who\u2019s hot: Well, it\u2019s finally getting hot for the Suns where it really counts \u2013 on the ladder. They are primed to play finals for the first time in club history \u2013 but, yes, we have said that before, and a challenging run home to September awaits. This time, though, Damien Hardwick has his team playing a robust brand of football that should stand up when it counts. New skipper Noah Anderson is in All-Australian form, while Matt Rowell has added more run to his game. The Suns are giving Rowell time to sign a contract extension, but it\u2019s a major worry the Victorian, with several suitors, has yet to do so. Perhaps that changes soon after the bye. Touk Miller is another midfielder pressing for All-Australian selection, while defender Sam Collins and mid-sized forward Ben Long would be locks for that team were it picked now. Key forward Ben King would also be close. Recruits Daniel Rioli and John Noble have done what was expected \u2013 provide dash and creativity from halfback. On our way: Matt Rowell and Ben King have had strong starts to the season, helping the Suns eye a maiden finals berth. Credit: Getty Images Who\u2019s not: Half-back flanker Connor Budarick has been in and out of the team and has not played at the senior level since the loss to the Lions. While Rioli and Noble enjoy the rebound accolades in defensive 50, a firing Budarick would also help. As Hardwick has noted, the Suns need to stop kicking to King when he is outnumbered. King had 23 goals in his first six games, the 24-year-old has 10 in his past six games. It\u2019s over to Ethan Read, Jed Walter and Ned Moyle to get busy. The verdict: The Suns likely need only five more wins to book a September berth, but face a potentially tough month after the break \u2013 GWS [Engie Stadium], Melbourne [People First Stadium], Essendon [Marvel Stadium] and Collingwood [People First Stadium]. Richmond [in round 21] appears their only certain win in the run home, but if they are good enough, they will make the finals. Their game plan is strong \u2013 they are among the best teams for points from turnovers, intercepts and stoppages, and know how to lock the ball inside their forward-half. It\u2019s about time the Suns broke their finals duck \u2013 we\u2019re backing Hardwick in.\n\nJon Pierik\u2019s grade: B Sydney (13th, 5 wins, 8 losses) Who\u2019s hot: Twelve months ago, the Swans were flag favourites and Isaac Heeney the top pick to win the Brownlow. That\u2019s not the case now, but Heeney remains their best-performed player. The gun midfielder is on track for similar numbers to his career-best 2024 but is lacking the same impact. The same could be said of Chad Warner, whose form has improved since the distraction of being out of contract was removed. Tagger James Jordon can count midfield stars Sam Walsh and Zach Merrett among his scalps. Youngster Matt Roberts continues to grow as a running defender, backing up his rapid improvement from last year. Who\u2019s not: An All Australian halfback last year, Nick Blakey is struggling with the extra attention on him. Injuries have forced the Swans to play him deeper, limiting his capacity to provide the springboard from defence that was a feature of their game last year. Ollie Florent paid the price for the Swans\u2019 poor form, his recent omission ending a run of 130 consecutive games. Hayden McLean is another from their grand final team who has also been dropped this year as the Swans search for marking power in their weakened forward line. Now that he is fit after a wretched 18 months with injury, skipper Callum Mills has the chance in the second half of the season to remind his critics why the club made him captain. Verdict: Injuries have wreaked havoc with rookie coach Dean Cox\u2019s first season at the helm. All Australians Errol Gulden, Tom Papley, Mills have all spent chunks of the season injured, as have reliable defender Harry Cunningham and young key forward Logan McDonald. Throw them all into the Swans\u2019 23, and it\u2019s unlikely they would be in such a desperate position. The crowded casualty ward has exposed a lack of depth. That said, the Swans have been so poor in several games that it would not have mattered who they had on the park. A fitter list raises hope they can mount a charge for the finals, but they are coming from a long way back.\n\nAndrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport are sent every Monday. Sign up for our Sport newsletter. Teams who had the bye in round 13 St Kilda (11th, five wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nJack Higgins has been a consistent force up forward, the small forward leading the Saints\u2019 goal kicking \u2013 including four goals against Geelong \u2013 to be included in the All-Australian preliminary squad. Jack Sinclair (27 disposals per game) and Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera (28) have been two of the premier rebounding half-backs. The dashing Wanganeen-Milera, off-contract and weighing up offers to return home to South Australia, has become the Saints\u2019 most important player, and the best player they have had in the past decade. That he has yet to agree to a contract extension by this point of the season is a major worry for the Saints. Former Western Bulldog Jack Macrae has been a strong leader through the midfield and found plenty of the ball (before a major lung injury), while intercept defender Callum Wilkie should be in All-Australian squad discussions. Youngster Hugo Garcia is making progress, despite a public spray from Ross Lyon during the loss to Brisbane and recent axing to the VFL. Marcus Windhager, one of several off-contract Saints, has, at times, been a stand-out, whether tagging or finding his own ball.\n\nCookin\u2019: Jack Higgins has had a strong season, and will be in All-Australian squad calculations. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Who\u2019s not?\n\nYoung midfielder Darcy Wilson has stagnated, while Mattaes Phillipou has endured an injury-hit start to the season, the latest a calf injury in the opening minutes against Melbourne. Wingman Brad Hill still provides dash, but there are times when he could rip a game open. Rowan Marshall has been steady, but is no longer among the conversation as one of the top three ruckmen in the league. Injuries to Max King and Zaine Cordy have hurt. Verdict: The Saints are 2-4 against top-eight teams, including their best win of the season, against Geelong. They are a system-based side, so, when the system wobbles, the whole team wobbles, which can lead to heavy defeats. The flip side is what we saw against Melbourne, when they dominated through scores from defence. That they are the only team to lose to the last-placed Eagles highlights the gulf between their worst and best. The Saints still remain a line-ball finals contender, as they were before this campaign began. Through that prism, they sit where many had expected. Jon Pierik\u2019s grade: C+ Man on a mission: Caleb Serong has been influential for the Dockers this season. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nFremantle (eighth, seven wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nMidfield gun Caleb Serong (28 disposals per game) typically finds plenty of the ball, but has struggled, at times, when there has been an aggressive tag. Fellow star onballer Andrew Brayshaw (also 28 disposals per game) has been busy, and put his body on the line in the desperate final minutes against Gold Coast on Saturday, and is also firmly in contention for All-Australian selection. Jordan Clark has provided drive from half-back, Shai Bolton has added life inside attacking 50 and been arguably the second-best recruit of the season (behind Bailey Smith), while Luke Jackson has been at his best when used as a sole ruckman. The Dockers have been one of the more efficient teams, according to Champion Data, but need to find more marks inside 50 if they are to challenge for a top-four spot. Loading Who\u2019s not?\n\nSean Darcy, tied to the club until the end of 2030, has largely been a shadow of his former self because of an off-season hampered by a knee issue but was strong in ruck contests in the wet against the Suns. Whether he and Jackson can thrive in the same team remains a burning question for coach Justin Longmuir. It also remains to be seen if talls Josh Treacy, Jye Amiss and Pat Voss can consistently also work alongside each other up forward, as the Dockers have struggled to turn inside-50 advantage into scores. That could also be because of a lack of speed with ball in hand, something the Dockers have looked to address. It was great to see Nat Fyfe back for his first senior game of the season last weekend. Hayden Young\u2019s extended absence because of a serious hamstring injury which has required surgery has hurt. He shapes as an x-factor later in the season. Verdict: The Dockers remain an enigma. They have a list capable of finishing in the top four, reinforced by their win on the Gold Coast and their three wins in five games against top-eight teams, but have had head-shaking losses, including a 61-point defeat to St Kilda at Marvel Stadium, and a 14-point loss at home to a depleted Collingwood. The pressure remains on Longmuir to deliver a deep finals run.\n\nJon Pierik\u2019s grade: B- Teams who had the bye in round 12 Carlton (12th, four wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nIn his 10th season, Jack Silvagni has been a revelation in his new role as a defender. Silvagni\u2019s ability to stop high-quality forwards, from a key type like Aaron Naughton to the medium-sized threat like Patrick Dangerfield, intercept and launch counter-attacks is one of the reasons why the Blues, for all their problems, has been one of the more difficult sides to score against. A streamlined George Hewett is having a career-best season in the midfield at the age of 29, and Nick Haynes has overcome a horror start to life as a Blue by turning the clock back to the pre-pandemic years. Tom De Koning was the best ruck in the competition in the first month, but his form has tailed off. Jacob Weitering had been in All-Australian form before two below-par games coming into the bye. Jack Silvagni has been a revelation in defence for the Blues so far this season. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nWho\u2019s not?\n\nThe Blues need more from their superstars. Patrick Cripps and Charlie Curnow are having reasonable years but are capable of finding another level. Harry McKay has struggled with consistency since returning from a mental health break, though his best has been the reason why the Blues have won. After another interrupted preseason, Sam Walsh has become just a player, unable to run opponents off their legs like he used to. The same can be said of Blake Acres, who is not having the same impact of his first two years at the club. Verdict: So much more was expected of the Blues, who have been one of the most disappointing clubs of the season. Despite having two Coleman medallists in their forward line the Blues are having enormous difficulties scoring. Their lack of class small forwards has hurt, but their ball movement is slow and imprecise. They are as tense as a patient visiting the dentist. Similar problems were overcome in 2023 when they mounted a stunning run to the preliminary final, but they do not have the same quality on their list. A friendly draw over the next month will give Blues fans hope but a finals berth is unlikely. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ Tristan Xerri is mounting a case for All-Australian selection this year. Credit: Getty Images North Melbourne (17th, two wins, one draw, eight losses)\n\nWho\u2019s hot?\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Tristan Xerri is again mounting a strong claim for a maiden All-Australian blazer. The ruckman, with his attack on the ball and wholehearted manner in which he plays, has become the Kangaroos\u2019 on-field spiritual leader. Small forward Paul Curtis has continued his improvement and, with 19 goals to the bye, is on track to pass his career-best haul of 30 last year. Cameron Zurhaar has rediscovered his bull-at-a-gate ways in attack to add much-needed bite to the forward line. Veteran Luke Parker has justified his acquisition on the field even if his greatest impact might be felt in the locker room. Who\u2019s not?\n\nThis might be harsh on North\u2019s leading possession-getter but Caleb Daniel is not having the impact he should. A damaging kick at his best, Daniel has often erred on the side of recklessness with his ball use by taking low-percentage options deep in defence. In his third year at Arden Street, Griffin Logue cannot get a clear run at it due to injury and now form. Dropped amid North\u2019s horror run, Logue is yet to reclaim his position in the side. The Roos need more from experienced duo Aidan Corr and Zac Fisher, who have both had stints in the VFL. Caleb Daniel: Plenty of possessions but more impact needed. Credit: Getty Images Verdict: As painful as this season has been for their fans, North have actually improved. At this stage last year, they were winless with a percentage of 55.9 and uncompetitive. This year, they have been in contention at three-quarter-time in eight games. The question is whether North should be further advanced after five seasons in the bottom two. Given they have traded away their first pick, the Kangaroos would have expected to have picked up an extra win or two instead of being in the familiar position of 17th.\n\nAndrew Wu\u2019s grade: D+ Port Adelaide (15th, four wins, seven losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nPort\u2019s best phase of the season came after Zak Butters returned from injury. Butters was instrumental in Port\u2019s best win of the year, against Hawthorn, but needs more help in the guts. The Power cannot afford to lose him. Moved to half-back, Connor Rozee has maintained his high standards while others\u2019 have fallen, though Port need him in the middle as well as providing run out of defence. Though not necessarily built for it, Mitch Georgiades has prospered being the main man in the forward 50. Miles Bergman\u2019s star is on the rise though he, like Butters, may be on the move at season\u2019s end. Who\u2019s not?\n\nEsava Ratugolea, Ivan Soldo, and Jordon Sweet were recruited at the end of 2023 to help Port take the next step. Eighteen months on, those moves have not had the desired effect. Ratugolea is struggling in an overworked defence that does not get enough pressure on the ball from up the field. Sweet lost his spot after being monstered by Tim English, and his understudy Soldo is out of favour. The move of Jeremy Finlayson into defence lasted just one disastrous game against Collingwood. Ed Richards has been a midfield weapon for the Western Bulldogs. Credit: Getty Images\n\nVerdict: Ken Hinkley\u2019s 13th and final season at the helm at Alberton is headed for an inglorious finish. Preliminary finalists last year, Port are headed for a bottom-six finish. The impending handover from Hinkley to Josh Carr is an easy target to explain Port\u2019s poor season even though many had tipped them to be this season\u2019s slider. The club would not have seen such a drop coming, given they traded out their first-round pick for Jack Lukosius, who has been injured. Most concerning is how quickly the Power have waved the white flag when things became difficult. Five of the heaviest losses of the Hinkley era have come in Port\u2019s last 24 games. Andrew Wu\u2019s grade: E Western Bulldogs (seventh, six wins, five losses) Who\u2019s hot?\n\nEd Richards has morphed from a capable half-back into one of the game\u2019s best midfielders in the past 12 months. Richards\u2019 speed and penetrating left foot makes him a major weapon for the Dogs. Rebounding defender Bailey Dale, who had a career-best 49 possessions a fortnight ago, is on track for a second All-Australian blazer. Tom Liberatore is defying Father Time. Small forward Rhylee West is one of the most improved players in the league, thriving since taking over from the injured Cody Weightman. Matt Kennedy is close to the recruit of the year since his move from Carlton, revelling as a midfielder who can also be dangerous when moved forward.",

    "text": "Are airlines responsible for notifying me if they change flight routes after a ticket has been booked? A natural consequence of rerouting a flight\u2019s course is an altered flight duration, either due to delays to control air traffic congestion or distance covered; flydubai\u2019s flights from Dubai to Moscow, for example, now route further east through Pakistan and Afghanistan instead of Iran, increasing flight time from roughly five hours to seven. Loading This means if you have booked a tight layover, you may have to rethink your itinerary \u2013 and it\u2019s worth noting that air traffic control may request a pilot follow an alternative route when the plane is already in the air. If you\u2019re flying the same airline all the way to Europe via the Middle East or elsewhere with a stop, on the same ticket, the airline should make arrangements for you to make your connection or get you on the next available flight if you miss it. According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), airline conditions of carriage do not include flight time guarantees, and it should not be assumed by consumers that a plane\u2019s exact advertised schedule will be met. They are, however, generally expected to notify passengers in a timely manner of changes to the flight schedule, which includes significant route changes.\n\n\u201cAirlines should be proactive and truthful in telling consumers the reasons a flight is delayed or cancelled,\u201d the ACCC says. \u201cThey should also tell consumers what compensation they may be entitled to under both the airline\u2019s policy and the consumer guarantees.\u201d Compensation and assistance from airlines may differ and depends on whether the delay or cancellation was within the carrier\u2019s control. Some travel insurance policies cover cancelling or rearranging flights due to natural disasters, severe weather, conflicts or terrorist incidents, though it depends on the specific policy\u2019s force majeure events clause. Some policies, for example, may only partially cover or exclude pandemics, epidemics, government-imposed travel restrictions and acts of war altogether. It\u2019s worth reviewing your product disclosure statement before travelling, and keeping this in mind when browsing cover options. What\u2019s the best source of information on travel safety for Australians? Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade uses Smartraveller for its official travel advisories, regularly updating each destination\u2019s risk and safety issues on the website. It\u2019s generally considered the most reliable source of safety information for Australian travellers.\n\nIn 2019, Smartraveller discontinued its pre-trip registration service. Instead, Australians travelling overseas are encouraged to subscribe to travel advice updates for specific destinations, which are sent every 24 hours via email. Loading In a crisis, Smartraveller may open a registration portal for destinations affected. At present, Australian citizens and permanent residents in Israel, Iran and Occupied Palestinian Territories who want to leave are encouraged to register with Smartraveller. As of June 20, almost 3000 Australians had registered to be evacuated out of Israel and Iran, with the Australian embassy in Tehran closing and Australian Defence Force personnel sent in to assist with evacuations. \u201cWe urge Australians who are able to leave Iran to do so now,\u201d Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a press conference on June 20. On June 19, travel advice to Australians in Iran was to travel to borders so they can leave the country.\n\nSome Australians in Iran, however, have been critical of the federal government\u2019s response. Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories also have a do not travel alert. What should I do if disaster strikes while I\u2019m on holiday? Those overseas who need immediate assistance from the Australian government are encouraged to contact the Consular Emergency Centre, which can be contacted 24/7 on +61 2 6261 3305 from anywhere in the world. It\u2019s also advised to search, memorise, physically write down and save in your phone the specific emergency services number for each of your travel destinations. Dialling triple zero while overseas will not connect you to local emergency services, though dialling 112 in most countries will redirect you to their local emergency services. Your basic pre-departure checklist, including the documents you need to have with you Confirm your passport\u2019s validity for at least six months from your trip\u2019s planned end date\n\nSecure the right visa for countries you\u2019re visiting and transiting through\n\nConfirm your flight and accommodation bookings, checking for any delays, changes, or what they accessibility services they offer. This may require contacting providers directly\n\nIf driving overseas, check if you need an international driving permit in addition to your Australian driver\u2019s licence\n\nGet a letter from your doctor and copies of your prescription for any medication you\u2019ll be taking with you, and check it\u2019s legal and available at your destination\n\nCheck what vaccinations are required for entry, and if the border requires proof you\u2019ve had them\n\nPurchase comprehensive travel insurance for yourself and your belongings, checking policies cover any planned activities beyond the basics\n\nMake physical and digital copies of all of the above documents, plus flight and accommodation information, for yourself and all travellers in your party, including babies and children. Store these separately from your original documents, and consider sharing a copy of your personal and travel documents, including your itinerary with flight information, with a trusted contact at home\n\nIf travelling with children who don\u2019t share your surname, you may need to bring documentation proving your relationship with them, such as birth certificates, adoption papers or custody papers\n\nNotify your bank and credit card companies about your travel dates and destinations. Some banks, such as ING, allow you to do this in their mobile app. It\u2019s generally wise to carry a small amount of cash for emergencies\n\nWhat about before I fly? What should be on my pre-departure to-do list? Travel requirements and destination-specific laws and advice may change with short notice, which may change your basic pre-departure to-do list. In general, it\u2019s advised to regularly check with the embassy or consulate of your planned destinations before every trip to see if visa conditions and medical requirements have changed. It\u2019s also advised to get a basic health check at least eight weeks before departure, and get the recommended vaccinations. Some countries require proof of immunisation against certain infectious diseases before entry, and some vaccines, such as the rabies vaccine, require multiple doses over multiple weeks. What do I need to know about travelling to the United States from Australia? The recent case of Australian writer Alistair Kitchen \u2013 who says he was detained and questioned for 12 hours by American border officials about his involvement in pro-Palestine activity, before being deported \u2013 has implications for Australians travelling to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program.\n\nThe Visa Waiver Program means Australians can access a fast-tracked system to apply for an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) pass, which, when approved, allows travellers to stay in the United States for up to 90 days without applying for a visa. When applying for your ESTA, be sure to use the official US government site, as there are many scam sites that will overcharge you for the service. Approved ESTA passes do not guarantee entry into the United States, however, and does not provide you with access to legal advice or much protection over digital devices if you\u2019re stopped at the border. Travellers also have to supply their social media handles during the ESTA application process. The application process for actual visas \u2013 B-1 for business and B-2 for recreation \u2013 is longer, with vetting including an interview at the United States consulate in Australia. It does mean that you would be likely to know you\u2019re going to be denied entry before boarding the plane, however, holding a B-1 or B-2 visa still does not guarantee you entry. Smartraveller says: \u201cUS authorities have broad powers to decide if you\u2019re eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law\u201d. They have the ability to detain, question and search passengers and their belongings, including digital devices, without having to supply evidence a crime has occurred. Following incidents where individuals have reported having their phones searched at the US border, it could be worth considering deleting social media apps off your phone before your flight, ensuring it\u2019s protected with a strong password, and, for iPhone users, enabling Lockdown Mode.",

    "text": "Fitz: What is it? Torvill: Bolero is obviously a very special routine because it opened the door for the future, and we wouldn\u2019t still be doing what we\u2019re doing without that. Fitz: So let\u2019s go back to the romance one! The personal chemistry and physical intimacy that you two display on ice as you dance is so wonderful; it dinkum is amazing that you can do it without ever having been a couple. Was there never a time, Chris, when you said to Jayne, surely, \u201cLet\u2019s go and see a film Saturday night?\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, forget it.\u201d Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean on the Our Last Dance tour in Perth this month. Credit: Alfie Hitchcock Dean: No, never like that. We have spent a lot of time together, seeing movies, going for drinks, and the theatre, all of those things. And of course, we\u2019ve been together on many long tours, like when we were touring Australia for the first time. We were meant to be coming for just two weeks, but ended up staying for three months doing shows, and then stayed a further nine months putting a show together. So we were in Sydney area for almost a year, and we made lots of friends.\n\nJayne Torvill and Christopher Dean kiss during their famous \u201cBolero\u201d routine at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. They racked up an unprecedented 12 perfect scores to win the gold medal for this performance. Credit: David Caulkin/ AP Fitz: [Painfully persisting] So never in that year, two young English athletes a long way from home, did you exchange smouldering looks over your Vegemite on toast ... Torvill: No, our main focus was getting the work done. You know, we had just turned professional, and for us, it was an exciting time in that we weren\u2019t competing any more, and we didn\u2019t have any rules and regulations of competition. So, in fact, you know, we were free to be more creative, which is something that we\u2019ve always enjoyed. Fitz: What about blues, then? There must have come a time over the last 45 years when you two were dancing, when Chris lifted you up, Jayne, so you could do a twirly gig and the booger didn\u2019t catch you properly? Surely, there must have been times where, to use the Australian expression, you came an absolute cropper, occasioning strong words? Torvill: No. Lucky for us, we never did have any major falls in competition, which is what counts. Falls in training, you accept. But we trained so hard that to be ready for anything, that we didn\u2019t really make any mistakes. So, no \u201cblues\u201d.\n\nFitz: Moving on! By some reckoning, the pop group ABBA was said to be a bigger success in Australia, even than in Sweden. There was something about ABBA that Australia, more than pretty much any other country, loved. Is it possible that the same applies to you two \u2013 that Australia loves Torvill and Dean more than even Britain loves Torvill and Dean, and that we loved you more than anywhere else on Earth. Dean: Maybe. When we first came to Australia, it was such a surprise for us to be so welcomed. The Australian promoter had pre-booked the Russian Olympic figure-skating team, thinking that they would win everything at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics, and they didn\u2019t. We did. And so the promoter said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get those bloody Poms down here\u201d. And so within a very short time, somebody came over to see us and gave us a contract, and we came down to Australia and we were adored. I mean, they tell the story of when the tickets first went on sale, that the line instantly formed up right round the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Torvill & Dean at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in January 1989. Credit: Fairfax Media Fitz: Which is very odd, yes? Because in Sydney, we\u2019re surfers, netballers, cricketers, footballers, but not really, as a people, ice skaters \u2013 with only a rink or two open on a good day? Dean: Yeah, I think what happened, Channel Nine were the host broadcasters at the Olympics, and we became very popular because they gave us a lot of air time. And we became the base of promoting the Winter Olympics in Australia. And there were also a lot of British expats who took to us, right?\n\nFitz: Whatever else, our love affair with you has been enduring. We also have a saying that a person has had \u201cmore comebacks than Dame Nellie Melba\u201d, lately replaced by \u201cmore farewell tours than Johnny Farnham\u201d. Whoever, with you two, came up with the title for your tour, Our Last Dance, has to be commended because it captures the imagination. But seriously, seriously, when you perform your last dance in Sydney [at Qudos on Sunday afternoon], when you come off the ice, is that really going to be it for you two? Your last dance? Dean: It will certainly be our last performance skating in Australia. But then we go back to Nottingham, our hometown, and we actually do four performances there, and then on the last day, that will be our last skating performance, live skating performance, that we will do. You know, we\u2019ve been skating together now for 50 years, and we think that that\u2019s a good round number to sort of call it a day from the performing side. And the body is ready to say it\u2019s time as well. Fitz: But don\u2019t you think that five years from now, one of you might say, \u201cI\u2019m in your town, I\u2019m going to put on a red wig. You put on a blonde one, and I\u2019ll see you down at the rink, and just one last time in the moonlight, let\u2019s dance?\u201d Torvill: It\u2019s not to say that we won\u2019t ever skate on the ice together, but we won\u2019t actually be performing together. So we may be together like choreographing or teaching somebody. We\u2019ll do other things together, but just not performing. This is it. Fitz: Chris? Don\u2019t you think that you might just do it one more time in the moonlight, when you\u2019re 80, one more time to capture the magic, one more time without anybody knowing, just the two of you?\n\nDean: [Thoughtfully] I\u2019m not saying that we won\u2019t do that ... but it\u2019s not something that we would show off to anybody ... It would be personal. Fitz: Bingo! Now, without being too mealy-mouthed about it, your dancing ability on ice must be comparable, in terms of how much it\u2019s celebrated, to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Did you two ever watch footage of their dancing and swoon? T & D: Yes! Dean: They were very much a part of our viewing, and we took a lot from them in their style and the movement and their performance quality. Yeah, absolutely, they were our idols. Fitz: You mentioned that you two have been doing it for 50 years. That means \u2013 dot three, carry one, subtract two \u2013 you must have started in the mid-\u203270s. How much have your physical abilities waned? Are there many things you used to be able to do that you simply cannot do now?\n\nTorvill: There are things that have got harder as we got older, and we\u2019re no longer 25, but we still feel that we can put on a show that we\u2019re happy with. And we\u2019ve put it together with some amazing [younger] skaters from around the world. So we\u2019re really excited by the show, and the show itself tells a story, our story, right from the beginning up until now. Loading Fitz: When Mick Jagger was 23 years old, he said, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not still singing Can\u2019t Get No Satisfaction when I\u2019m 30\u201d. Could you two have conceived that you\u2019d still be going 50 years later? And would you have been thrilled? Torvill: No and yes. We would never have imagined it would have been possible. Back then, when skaters turned professional, they would maybe do two years, three years in a professional show, and then, you know, sort of maybe go into teaching or just retire anyway. We\u2019ve just been so lucky with the way things happened for us \u2013 that we were able to create several different tours, and then go back to the Olympics in \u201994 because that became a possibility, and that extended our professional careers. Dean: And then, in more recent times, television people came and said, would we be interested in teaching celebrities to skate? And that\u2019s when Dancing on Ice was born. And that extended us, too.\n\nFitz: All right, one last question. I\u2019ve got two tragically proud boasts in my life. The first is that I was once sent off against the All Blacks for violence. The second is that I have danced on ice with Torvill & Dean. I shot a story for Channel Nine\u2019s Today Show in the early \u201990s, which involved me skating around with you two. Do you two happen to remember it? Torvill. [Uncertainly] No, I don\u2019t remember it. Because we\u2019ve had a number of occasions, Peter, where we\u2019ve skated around with a presenter, a program or a journalist ... Fitz: [Brightly] I was the one where you looked at me, Jayne, with the expression of \u201cHow has it come to this? I am on the ice with a rhinoceros ...\u201d Torvill: No ...",

    "text": "Locals want to see the 'heart' of the island restored to native woodland, and believe this is their 'once-in-a-generation' chance.\n\nThe pine forest takes up more than 2,500 hectares of land on Bribie Island, with many homes around the southern end. Source: Google Earth\n\nJust off the coast of Brisbane's north lies Bribie Island, a 34km stretch of land that has seen a rapid transformation in recent years. With its pristine beaches, growing population and rising property values, the island has become a hotspot not just for tourists, but for investors and sea-changers alike.\n\nYet, tucked away from the beaches, shops and golf courses is a huge pine plantation that takes up nearly 20 per cent of the island. It\u2019s been a working forest for decades, but it\u2019s also sitting on land that would be worth millions on today\u2019s market.\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, the trees are about to be harvested \u2014 and that\u2019s opened the door for a different conversation.\n\nMany locals are calling for change. Rather than replanting rows and rows of introduced pines, they want to bring back native forests and parklands to \"restore the heart\" of the island. And with the harvest beginning in July, they feel like this could be a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity to restore the land before more pines are planted and a new cycle begins.\n\nThe environmental association would like to see the gradual return of some of the plantation land. Source: BIEPA\n\n\"This is the best opportunity that we'll have to negotiate a better outcome for the environment,\" Richard Ogden, president of the Bribie Island Environmental Protection Association Inc (BIEPA), told Yahoo News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Bribie is really trying to step up and do what's necessary to protect and conserve nature for future generations.\"\n\nBIEPA say the plantation is impacting the natural landscape of the island in several ways:\n\nInadequate control of feral pigs with the plantation\n\nDrifting herbicide damaging native vegetation\n\nPine 'wildlings' invading other areas of parklands\n\nFears of pollution from fertiliser\n\nBig trucks loaded with logs could damage the Bribie Island Bridge\n\nHarvest set to take place over the next 10 years\n\nSeveral weeks ago, HQPlantations (HQP) sent a letter to residents advising of the upcoming harvest. The population has grown by more than 50 per cent since the last harvest took place, with BIEPA fearing that some new residents may not even be aware that industrial forestry operates on the island.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a new statement on their website, HQP said they have modified their plans to minimise impacts to residents and road users. The pines will be harvested over the next 10 years at a rate of approximately 100 hectares per year.\n\nWhile HQP didn't respond to Yahoo's questions about future plans for the land, it confirmed in the statement that it would be replanting pine seedlings in accordance with its licensing. The company has a 99-year lease with the state government that began in 2010.\n\nHQP manages 310,000 hectares of plantation forests across NSW and Far North Queensland, planting up to 10 million seedlings annually. The Bribie Island site consists of 2,500 hectares of sustainably grown timber.\n\nIf the pines are replanted, what does it mean for Bribie's heart?\n\nRichard and his fellow volunteers at BIEPA understand that HQP are running a business and is not breaking any laws, but they feel that the goal of a restored forest can still be achieved.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"What we'd like is for the state government to turn that back to a national park over time, but the only way that they (HQP) would probably agree to that is if the state government makes available an equivalent amount of land on the mainland,\" Richard said.\n\n\"We do like to see the plantation operators as neighbours and companions, and we like to see ourselves as valuable community partners.\n\nThis map shows the areas slated for the upcoming harvest, with the areas in green being targeted first. Source: HQ Plantations\n\n\"We're coming at it from a point of view of, obviously, conserving nature for the future and putting Bribie's nature first. But we also understand that there's a commercial imperative, and we have observed that there are very real perspectives on this, that it could very well be in the economic best interests in the future to move the plantations from Bribie.\n\n\"But as we understand, it's probably going to take a number of years. It could be a decade or even two decades before that actually became complete.\"\n\nState government, local council respond\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries said the plantation is essential to supply timber for the housing market.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"A sustainable local timber supply is required to manage the growing demand for housing and meet the Queensland Government\u2019s commitment of constructing one million homes by 2044,\" they said.\n\n\"Converting this plantation area to another use would require a change to the underlying State Forest tenure, and a compensation payment to HQP, which has a 99-year lease agreement. Further enquiries regarding plantation-harvesting operations on Bribie Island should be directed to HQP.\"\n\nThe City of Moreton Bay said it is committed to \"protecting and enhancing its natural areas and wildlife habitats\". \"While these activities are a matter for the Queensland Government, Council remains focused on \u2018Going Green as we Grow\u2019, playing its role in managing and protecting its natural areas while planning for urban growth,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe council\u2019s Environment and Sustainability Strategy 2042 aims to maintain the region's current native vegetation cover of 42 per cent, with a view to increasing it over time.\n\n\"Council also has a Land Buyback for Environmental Purposes Program to acquire, restore and rehabilitate land across the City to conserve ecological communities and wildlife habitats for the benefit of our communities,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOn June 24, HQP is holding a community drop-in session for anyone looking for more information about the upcoming work.

    "text": "As Australia races to slash emissions and cut energy bills, one quiet coastal town is already living the future.\n\nAt The Cape, a purpose-built sustainable estate in Cape Paterson, more than 30 per cent of households now own an electric vehicle. Source: Supplied\n\nAs Australia pushes to cut carbon emissions and reduce household bills, electrification has emerged as a key focus \u2014 from the cars we drive to the way we power our homes. But while rooftop solar is booming, the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and fully electric homes remains modest.\n\nNationally, just 2.7 per cent of vehicles on Australian roads are electric, according to the Electric Vehicle Council. While over 10 per cent of new cars sold are now electric, that figure still trails the UK (17 per cent), Germany (19 per cent) and Norway (over 80 per cent). At the household level, gas is still widely used, and many homes are poorly equipped to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates argue the future of EVs in Australia looks bright, but in a quiet corner of Victoria\u2019s Bass Coast, one community has already quietly surged ahead, offering a glimpse of what a fully electrified future could look like.\n\nAt The Cape, a purpose-built sustainable estate in Cape Paterson, more than 30 per cent of households now own an electric vehicle. Every home is powered without gas, using rooftop solar and passive solar design principles, and achieves an average eight-star NatHERS energy rating \u2014 well above the national average of 6.2 stars for new builds. \"More than 30 per cent of households have an EV,\" Director and resident Brendan Condon told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Homes are 100 per cent electric with no gas connections, powered by rooftop solar, and designed using passive solar principles. This community-wide commitment to electrification, from the grid to the garage, makes [us] a national front-runner and an insight into the future of a fully electrified Australia.\"\n\nResident Marie drives a Tesla. Source: Supplied\n\nFully electric homes, rooftop solar and soaring EV uptake\n\nThe estate comprises 230 residential lots, with about 140 homes completed and over 250 residents. More than 95 per cent of EV charging is done at home, helping cut costs and reduce strain on the wider grid, particularly in a regional area where public charging infrastructure remains limited.\n\n\"Even in regional areas, most trips are local or to nearby centres like Wonthaggi and Inverloch, which are well within EV range,\" Condon said. \"A round trip to Melbourne is under 300 kilometres, which is easily achievable by numerous long-range EVs now on the market.\"\n\nThe Cape also challenges the notion that electric living is the preserve of wealthy inner-city enclaves. While upfront costs are still a barrier, residents claim long-term savings. Condon says homes that pair solar with energy-efficient design and an EV can save upwards of $6,000 annually. Once fully built, the community is projected to save more than $1 million a year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"These are 'super bill-busting' homes,\" he said. \"That money stays in household budgets and bank accounts, which is significant in the current cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\nExperts agree that electrifying homes and vehicles is essential to meeting emissions targets. The Climate Council estimates that switching to solar and electric could save households $3,000 to $5,000 a year and cut domestic emissions by up to 42 per cent.\n\nThe tight-knit community in Victoria has been dubbed Australia's unofficial 'EV capital'. Source: Supplied\n\nIt also supports energy independence and grid resilience by decentralising power generation.\n\nStill, challenges remain. Critics point to the cost of EVs and the difficulty of retrofitting older homes. There are also concerns about supply chains, mineral dependency for batteries, and whether the national grid is ready for widespread electrification without major upgrades.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Condon believes communities like his show what\u2019s possible when sustainability is designed from the ground up. With the federal government introducing a New Vehicle Efficiency Standard in 2025 and aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, more neighbourhoods may follow suit.\n\n\"[We're] a real-world blueprint,\" he said. \"It shows how communities can decouple from expensive fossil fuels and thrive \u2014 creating zero-emissions, climate-resilient neighbourhoods that aren\u2019t just imagined, but built.\"\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
