While parents have told us they want action earlier, parents of teachers have told us that they need the tools and the training so that they can do the job,\" Jason Clare told Today.\n\n\"There are programs that are already being used by some schools.

(AP)\n\nWhat even is a bubble?\n\nSo, are they right? And what happens if the AI bubble bursts?\n\nStanford Graduate School of Business Professor Anat Admati says the concept of a bubble is not well defined, and it's almost impossible to identify one in real time.\n\n\"Stock valuation and timing stocks is very difficult because the stock reflects the entire future and all lots and lots of factors,\" she tells 9news.com.au.\n\n\"So the notion that you're diagnosing a bubble as it's happening is often folly.\n\n\"People form beliefs and decide to trade, and it's a very dangerous game to play for investors, for pundits, journalists like yourself.\"\n\nThe OpenAI logo is seen on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen displaying output from ChatGPT. (AP)\n\nOxford Economics lead economist Adam Slater sees \"some symptoms of a bubble\", including rapid growth in tech stock prices and the fact tech stocks now comprise about 40 per cent of the S&P 500 stock market tracking the 500 leading US companies.\n\nHe also points to market valuations that appear \"stretched\" beyond their worth and \"a general sense of extreme optimism in terms of the underlying technology, despite the enormous uncertainties around what this technology might ultimately yield\".\n\nSome analysts suggest AI could lead to productivity gains not seen since Europe after World War II, while Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu has predicted a 0.7 per cent gain in US productivity over a decade.\n\n\"You've got this incredibly wide range of possibilities,\" Slater says.\n\n\"Nobody really knows where it's going to land.\"\n\nOpenAI isn't the only player in the AI game. (Getty)\n\nIs this the dotcom boom 2.0?\n\nThe easy comparison, which even Altman and his Open AI chairman, Bret Taylor, have made, is with the dotcom boom, when the tech-heavy NASDAQ surged almost 600 per cent in the mid-to-late '90s before wiping off almost all of those games in about a year and a half.\n\nA swathe of start-ups were wiped out and even big hitters still around today such as Microsoft, Oracle and Intel took a battering on the markets.\n\nAdmati says it's too hard to predict whether a potential AI bubble bursting would do anything more than correcting the price of some companies, much less when it might happen.\n\nA swathe of start-ups were wiped out and even big hitters still around today such as Microsoft, Oracle and Intel took a battering on the markets. (AP)\n\n\"The internet bubble burst didn't change the entire world economy,\" she says.\n\n\"It was a price correction in a relatively narrow sector.\"\n\nTaylor puts a positive on the comparison, saying you could argue people pouring money into internet stocks in 1999 were broadly right.\n\n\"If you look at the internet bubble, a lot of people think about the flops, like Pets.com and Webvan,\" he tells The Verge.\n\n\"Through the lens of the past 30 years, though, we've now gotten most of the largest companies in the world, including Amazon and Google, two of the largest companies in the world.\"\n\nTaylor argues people pouring money into internet stocks in 1999 were broadly right. (AP Photo/Richard Drew FILE)\n\n'It's the fear of missing out'\n\nOpenAI is the most striking example of AI investment because it's come from nothing to be one of the world's most hyped companies in a few years based solely on the promise of its tech.\n\nIt is now valued at roughly $US500 billion ($771.9 billion), not too far below the GDP of Austria ($804.1 billion) or the 2023-24 GSP (gross state product) of NSW ($821 billion).\n\nBut the big boys are also shovelling money into their large language models and other AI research.\n\nGoogle is all-in on AI across its phones and even search and just this week announced another $US15 billion investment in an AI data hub, Amazon looks set to spend $US100 billion ($154.5 billion) on the technology this year, Apple boss Tim Cook told employees the AI revolution was \"as big or bigger\" as the internet, smartphones, cloud computing and apps.\n\nGoogle's Gemini AI assistant. (Google)\n\nChipmaker NVIDIA's surge to become the biggest company in the world by market capitalisation \u2013 overtaking even Apple \u2013 was so dramatic that it spurred a wave of articles about how the name is pronounced (en-VID-eeyah, by the way).\n\nIt was driven by a ravenous demand for the company's high-end GPUs, prized above all else in battle for the massive amounts of computing power it takes to sustain these huge companies' AI computing demands.\n\nSo when it invested $US100 billion in OpenAI, which, as well as being one of its main customers, has a 10 per cent stake in chip rival AMD, eyebrows were raised at this \"circular\" financing.\n\nAMD and OpenAI have agreed to a multibillion-dollar deal. (AP)\n\n\"A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft, Google, and a few others is reported almost daily,\" Yale School of Management leadership expert Professor Jeffrey A Sonnenfeld and senior research fellow Stephen Henriques wrote in an opinion piece called This is how the AI bubble bursts.\n\n\"Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis.\"\n\nHenriques tells 9news.com.au the risks are likely closer to those of the dotcom boom, where there is promise that \"will take a lot longer to materialise than people expect\".\n\n\"It's the fear of missing out,\" Sonnenfeld says.\n\n\"Everybody you know thinks that the costs of missing it are too high, enterprise wise and career wise, to look like you're an anachronism.\"\n\nMicrosoft is a major investor in OpenAI. (AP)\n\nIn their article, the researchers point out that in less than three years, OpenAI has \"gone from a parlour game to a pillar of the global economy\".\n\n\"After pillar, you wonder if you're going to wind up with a pile of rubble, and how to then rebuild out of the shakeout, where you see a lot of damage and carnage done,\" Sonnenfeld tells 9news.com.au.\n\nThe upside\n\nBezos argues the AI boom will be good for the world even if the bubble bursts, describing it as industrial, rather than financial or banking.\n\n\"The ones that are industrial are not nearly as bad. It could even be good because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, society benefits from those inventions,\" Bezos said at a recent tech conference in Italy.\n\nHe compared it to a previous biotech bubble in the 1990s that resulted in new life-saving drugs.\n\n\"Every company gets funded, the good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement distinguishing between the good and bad ideas and so that's also probably happening today,\" he said.\n\nAltman last month predicted people would \"make some dumb capital allocations\", resulting in short-term ups and downs.\n\nBut he was confident it would drive \"a new wave of unprecedented economic growth\", scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and \"new ways to express creativity\".\n\nThe information provided on this website is general in nature only and does not constitute personal financial advice.

(ABC News: Sarah Moss)\n\nMr Berzins said using heavy horses and antique equipment was not as quick as modern day farming practices but believed it had other benefits.\n\n\"The way the soil is turned over with horses in general is slower and I think it's better for the soil,\" he said.\n\n\"You're using it more in an organic way, turning [the soil] over with a moldboard plough or scarifying the paddock to knock the weeds.\"\n\nInspired by childhood memories\n\nMr Berzins said working with a team of horses involved time and patience.\n\n\"They're not like a tractor \u2014 you can't just put a key in,\" he said.\n\n\"When you're working multiple, say a team of eight [horses], they've all got different personalities, so putting them in places where they are happy is important.\"\n\nMr Berzins developed his interest in heavy horses by working with his grandfather, Sidney Samuels.\n\nAleks Berzins learnt about heavy horses from Sidney Samuel.

    "text": "On a perfectly still Perth morning, an eight-man rowing boat cuts through the glassy Swan River.\n\nThe crew is doing sets of two minutes on, one minute off, as they put the finishing touches on years of preparation.\n\nThe men, aged in their 40s and 50s, are the Black Swans \u2014 a group of former high-level rowers who reunited five years ago, and are now off to America to compete in the world's biggest and most famous rowing race.\n\nThe Black Swans' pictured at their last training session in Perth before they set off for the US. (ABC News: Tom Wildie)\n\n\"The intention was just to row and be fit and healthy and get on the water,\" stroke Stuart Reside said of the crew's formation.\n\n\"The racing is a real secondary aspect of the crew, I suppose, as we've stayed together and we've wanted to get better and better along the way.\"\n\nNow, more than 20 years after Reside won bronze in the men's eight at the Athens Olympics, they are taking on the Head of the Charles Regatta in Boston.\n\nStuart Reside (front right) won bronze at the Athens Olympics in the men's eight. (Getty Images)\n\n\"We've done the Head of the Yarra in Melbourne a couple of times and we've raced in the state champs here several times so that's been good,\" he said.\n\n\"Then we thought we'd do this ... which is a really iconic international race.\"\n\nWhile it seems natural that a group of former elite rowers would want to compete at the top level again, it wasn't their intention.\n\nWhen Reside got a call from his friend Greg Carr about putting a crew together, he was initially reluctant.\n\nThe men's eight at the Athens Olympics in action on the way to winning bronze. (Getty Images)\n\nAfter the success of Athens, he'd barely been in a boat, and thought his days of early starts and gruelling hours on the water were behind him.\n\n\"You look back at rowing with lots of fond memories and sort of through rose coloured glasses,\" he said.\n\n\"You tend to forget the hard bits of it. So when I was asked to join in, I said 'Oh, I don't know if I've kind of got it in me.'\"\n\nBut once he found out who was in the crew, he was convinced.\n\nWhat a crew\n\nApart from Reside, three other members of the squad have won Olympic medals. Ron Snook claimed bronze in the men's quad at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott won silver in the coxless pair at the same Games and Glen Loftus won silver in the coxless four at Athens.\n\nRob Scott (left), won silver at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, pairing with David Weightman in the men's coxless pairs. (AAP PHOTO / ROD TAYLOR)\n\nUnfortunately for Scott, a back injury will prevent him from taking part in the race.\n\nThere are also several former national and international rowers who make up the team, and a founding member of a platinum-selling band sits in the coxswain chair.\n\n\"The people that were involved that Greg mentioned to me, and the times that we shared before, and just the the common respect of those people, really was the main driver for me to get involved,\" Reside said.\n\n\"There was a lot of confidence that we were going to get together and the standard of rowing was going to be really good. It's a nice feeling when the boat runs well.\"\n\nWhat started out as rowing for fun and connection has culminated in a trip to Boston, where they will be one of 2,000 crews racing, with tens of thousands of spectators watching on the banks.\n\nThe race takes place on the Charles River, which separates Boston from Cambridge, and passes the Harvard University Boat Club, which has featured in several films.\n\nTaking part in the race will be reward for years of work, but Reside maintains they would have rowed together regardless of the goal.\n\n\"I think we all need diversity in our lives,\" he said.\n\n\" For me, it's about having lots of different strings to your bow. Rowing's one of those in my life. \"\n\n\"It offers a lot in terms of balance and experience and just clearing the head, clearing the pipes of the body, keeping the heart rate up.\"\n\nRowing and music intersect\n\nWhile Reside and the crew do the work of pulling the oars, they rely heavily on the guidance of their coxswain, Bourby Webster.\n\nBourby Webster, founder of the Perth Symphony Orchestra and a founding member of BOND, is the crew's coxswain. (ABC News: Tom Wildie)\n\nRowing has been a constant in Webster's life, even as she's pursued other passions such as founding the Perth Symphony Orchestra or being a founding member of the UK-based electric string quartet BOND.\n\n\"Music has always been a huge part of my life and it's always been a challenge, because music is at night and rowing is in the morning,\" she said.\n\n\"But there are unbelievable parallels between them. With rowing, you're constantly aiming for a competition. In music you're constantly aiming for a concert, there is no extension of a deadline.\n\n\"It's about delivering. Working towards something, being able to deliver at that point in time, but also both music and rowing are synchronised.\"\n\nThe coxswain is like the conductor of a symphony, keeping the rowers in time, and steering the boat.\n\nThe crew will need to place a lot of trust in cox, Bourby Webster, who will be responsible for avoiding other boats on the river. (ABC News: Tom Wildie)\n\nThe Head of the Charles race sees boats set off every 15 seconds to take on the winding three-mile (or roughly five kilometre) river course.\n\nFaster boats which start further down the order have to navigate choppy water and slower crews as they try to produce a competitive time.\n\n\"It's a hugely exciting race. It's a very dynamic race,\" Webster said.\n\n\"The whole crew is simmering. That's the only word I can feel. There's just an adrenaline in all of us.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to. A newsletter delivered each Saturday.",

    "text": "Phoebe Litchfield may well go on to become an all-time batting maestro for Australia, but for the moment the young gun is simply enjoying the best view in the house as her fellow opener and skipper shows her the path to greatness.\n\nLitchfield watched in awe from the other end as Alyssa Healy first caned India on Sunday and then Bangladesh on Wednesday for thrilling back-to-back centuries that helped push the champions into the semifinals in their World Cup title defence.\n\nAt just 22, the elegant but thoroughly modern left-hander Litchfield \u2014 a player with all the shots and some more we doubtless have not yet seen \u2014 looks to be coming of age at this event.\n\nIndeed, she might have reached her first World Cup ton herself on Wednesday if, in the dazzling unbroken 202 stand with her captain, Healy had not turned on the after-burners with victory in sight.\n\nBut watching the skipper first go past 7,000 career international runs \u2014 only the third Australian to do so after Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry \u2014 while also becoming the first woman to rack up back-to-back World Cup centuries in two separate tournaments, left Litchfield feeling she was getting a rare education.\n\nPhoebe Litchfield (left) had a front row seat for Alyssa Healy's ton against Bangladesh. (Getty Images: ICC/Alex Davidson)\n\n\"Seven thousand? That's an amazing achievement. That's a lot of runs,\" smiled Litchfield.\n\n\"But seeing that from the other end and at training, and just even being able to play with her, it's such a huge honour.\n\n\"Just to see how her brain clicks and how she goes about scoring runs, I look up to her a lot.\n\n\"Especially that mind-frame of going hard at the ball and being attacking, I learn a lot off that.\n\n\" Midge is in awesome form. Back-to-back hundreds? It reminds me of another tournament she did that in \u2014 so it's good signs. \"\n\nLitchfield had yet to make her Australia debut when she watched Healy crack 129 in the semifinals and 170 in the final to power the 2022 World Cup side to victory in New Zealand, so hopes the skipper's reprise in India could be an omen.\n\nIn the three years since she has taken to the stage so naturally, the 22-year-old has already amassed 1,738 international runs herself, but it is only really in the last couple of months that it has felt as though Litchfield is getting the best out of her rare gift on a consistent basis.\n\nSince August, while being crowned MVP of the Women's Hundred tournament in England, she has cracked 568 runs in 12 knocks at an average of 71. In the last month alone, since arriving in India, she has hit 338 runs at 67.6 per innings, spearheading Australia's charge.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nShe felt her unbeaten 84 against Bangladesh had not been her most fluent innings. \"But it's more meaningful to get through those kind of innings compared to when you're on a flattie,\" she said of the test.\n\n\"The challenges of adapting to conditions is probably the biggest thing I've learned, and it's put me in good stead for the next few fixtures.\"\n\nNext up it is England in Indore on Wednesday, with Australia safe in the knowledge a semifinal spot is already in the bag.\n\n\"To know in the back of our minds we're in the semis gives us confidence to go into that England game and put another good performance on the board,\" said Litchfield.\n\n\"We know that even though we came off the Ashes, winning 16-0, they'll come pretty hard in a few days time. So pretty excited for that.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "North Melbourne has not been beaten since the 2023 AFLW grand final, and the question on many lips is who, if anyone, can beat the reigning premier?\n\nCurrently on a winning streak of 21 games, and an undefeated streak of 23, the Roos are edging ever closer to the most consecutive victories across the VFL/AFL/AFLW \u2014 23 wins (26 unbeaten) by Geelong in 1952-53.\n\nExactly how they are doing it, however, is fascinating.\n\nHaving developed the program, layer by layer, since joining the AFLW in 2019, their disciplined, professional style of footy is forcing the rest of the league to rise to their level.\n\nEverything starts with defence\n\nThe first part of North Melbourne's AFLW supremacy is its stingy defensive line.\n\nUnder Darren Crocker's tenure, defending the whole ground \u2014 not just down back \u2014 has been the main priority from which the rest of the game plan has been able to launch.\n\nThe Roos have conceded the fewest average points in the league in each of the last three seasons and have given up 40 or more points on just three occasions in that time.\n\nSeason Average points against 2025 22.2 (lowest in league) 2024 19.2 (lowest in league) 2023 22.9 (lowest in league) 2022 (S7) 24.2 2022 (S6) 28.9 2021 31.6\n\nResponsibility to defend falls on every player on the ground. Establishing layers of defence \u2014 in close at the contest, outside in space, deep in the backline, and higher up the ground \u2014 requires an incredible amount of discipline and understanding from the playing group.\n\nAs the AFLW begins to even out, one team remains untouchable North Melbourne claims its 20th win in a row as it looks to go undefeated for another season.\n\nAs the most experienced list in the AFLW this season, with an average of 51.2 games per player ahead of round 10, finding that chemistry with one another has been a slow burn over time.\n\nMeanwhile, with such a clear system, which calls for lengthening the ground and restraint to avoid being unnecessarily drawn up to the ball, they present repeat challenges for opposition forwards to break through if they are any chance of scoring.\n\nGoaling against North Melbourne is an example of a \"Swiss cheese model\" whereby specific barriers on many layers must break down in specific ways for the club to concede scores.\n\nGenerally, problems or errors in one layer are mitigated by several other layers of defence.\n\nNot even personnel shifts have created growing pains. Last year Libby Birch was added to the line and she slotted in with ease, helping the line adapt in the face of a long-term injury to Emma Kearney.\n\nThis year, Sarah Wright has been absent with personal issues, but replacement signing Tessa Boyd has filled the gap with aplomb.\n\nMaintaining control of the football\n\nThe most fascinating part of North Melbourne's powerful 2025 season to date has been just how efficiently it has controlled the footy.\n\nThis year the Roos are averaging 322.6 disposals per game \u2014 more than any other team in the history of the league \u2014 and are using those disposals at another record 67.4 per cent efficiency.\n\nWinning more footy than ever before, and using it better.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nSuch neat control of the ball means the Roos can play their way, keeping things on their terms for long periods of games.\n\nEven in the face of an impressive Essendon pressure game, and wild weather at Windy Hill, they still recorded a disposal efficiency of 63.3 per cent in round seven \u2014 although, that was their lowest efficiency of the season to date.\n\nThis is another example of chemistry within the playing group.\n\nYes, elite skill is required to use the ball with such control, but understanding of one another, and the system they are executing is just as important.\n\nFifteen of North Melbourne's 26 players who have run out for at least one game this season do so at an average efficiency of 65 per cent or above. The average efficiency across the AFLW this year is 61.6 per cent.\n\nFinishing off the hard work in front of goal\n\nThe last piece of North Melbourne's puzzle in recent seasons has been its own ability to score after stopping the opposition's attempts.\n\nLast year that pure scoring power was on show, with an average of 57.9 points per game, but this year it exploded.\n\nWith an AFLW record of 73.7 points per game, hitting a league high of 114 points in round three against Fremantle, it is the pure spread of goal kickers that has been most impressive.\n\nClub (season) Average points for North Melbourne (2025)* 73.7 Adelaide (2019) 59.1 Melbourne (2023) 58.9 Melbourne (2025)* 58.2 North Melbourne (2024) 57.9 Adelaide (2023) 57.6 Brisbane (2025)* 55.7 Hawthorn (2024) 52.2 Sydney (2025)* 51.9 Fremantle (2020) 51.0\n\n*Correct as of the conclusion of round nine, 2025\n\nThe league's equal-leading goal kicker, of course, hails from the Roos in Jasmine Garner, who enters round 10 with 96 goals to her name. A midfielder, no less.\n\nBut in the top five goal kickers for the 2025 season, three are from North Melbourne. Garner (18) is joined by Blaithin Bogue (17) and Tahlia Randall (16).\n\nWith 7.3 Roos goaling each week \u2014 another record \u2014 they are a side that is near-on impossible to defend, as there is such an array of attacking weapons.\n\nThose weapons are well-serviced, however, thanks to the aforementioned control of the footy and clear game style.\n\nIt has led to 13.3 marks inside 50 per game from 46.3 inside 50s, and those on the end of that delivery are holding up their end of the bargain, converting at a whopping 54.4 per cent goal accuracy.\n\nSo, when people say the Roos are on a record-breaking run, that might even be understating it.\n\nNorth Melbourne is setting the new standard of what the AFLW will become, and although no team in the league's history has ever gone back-to-back, that seems like yet another record set to tumble come November.",

    "text": "Welcome to the ABC Arts October movie wrap.\n\nThis month our cinephile critics took in everything from an Australian comedy that revolves around a time-travelling tequila bottle to the highly anticipated Bruce Springsteen biopic starring The Bear's Jeremy Allen White.\n\nPlus, what happens when wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson sets his eyes on Oscar gold? Find out with Benny Safdie's sparkling new sports drama.\n\nHappy watching!\n\nSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\n\nJeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen and Odessa Young as Faye in Deliver Me From Nowhere. (Supplied: Disney)\n\nFrom The Bear to the Boss, Jeremy Allen White swaps the kitchen apron for denim and leather in this enjoyable, music-heavy portrait of Bruce Springsteen at an artistic and commercial crossroads in the early 1980s.\n\nFast facts Starring: Jeremy Allen White, Jeremy Strong, Paul Walter Hauser, Odessa Young Director: Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) Where: In cinemas October 23\n\nUnder pressure to deliver a hit but wrestling with depression and memories of his abusive father, Springsteen holes up in New Jersey \u2014 with a head full of American duo Suicide and Terrence Malick's Badlands \u2014 to obsess over the dark, cassette-recorded sounds that would become 1982's haunting Nebraska. At the same time, he's laying down early versions of the songs destined for 1984's blockbuster Born in the USA.\n\nDoing his own singing, Jeremy Allen White makes for a smouldering Boss (at the film's New York Film Festival premiere, a modest Springsteen praised the actor for playing a \"better looking version of me\"), but the real star of the movie is Jeremy Strong as Springsteen's long-time manager and producer Jon Landau. Decked out in turtlenecks, thick lenses and a Noo Yawk accent, the Succession alum locks in with a remarkably straight face, even when delivering lines like: \"I think the muse came down and kissed you on the mouth.\"\n\nFans of the Boss will be thrilled, while casual acquaintances just might emerge with a new-found love of the music.\n\nLuke Goodsell\n\nThe Smashing Machine\n\nDwayne Johnson as UFC legend Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine. (Supplied: VVS Films)\n\nOscar-nominee The Rock? It's more likely than you might think. The Smashing Machine is the perfect awards ploy for Dwayne Johnson, playing real-life American MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr, as inner demons surface amid his first-ever loss in the ring in 1999.\n\nFast facts Starring: Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Ryan Bader, Bas Rutten Director: Benny Safdie Where: In cinemas now\n\nThat's a big step for Johnson, who's previously negotiated \"can't lose\" clauses in action movie contracts; maybe it\u2019s OK here, as he\u2019s almost unrecognisable thanks to prosthetics and fuzzy head of hair. Either way, the action star disappears into Kerr.\n\nAt the film's core is a great unease underneath Kerr's relationship with girlfriend Dawn (Emily Blunt), emerging slowly as he fights against the cloud of addiction. Blunt is used to adding weight to sliver-thin wife roles, but Dawn's cocktail of insecurities and resentments is anything but. She's not a neat character, and neither is their relationship \u2014 mostly because the film takes little liberties with Kerr's life, pulling from the startling raw 2002 HBO documentary of the same name.\n\nDisarmingly simple and unflashy, The Smashing Machine is not exactly the first solo directorial feature fans expected from Benny Safdie, as his previous efforts with brother Josh (Good Time; Uncut Gems) have been tightly-wound descents to the bottom.\n\nBut even in losing, Kerr doesn't reach the bottom. This is a movie about settling for less than greatness \u2014 a strange, dulling minor note that elevates this above the standard biopic, with an irresolution that's far more interesting than it's getting credit for.\n\nJared Richards\n\nTRON: Ares\n\nAres is the third film in the TRON series, following on from 2010's TRON: Legacy. (Supplied: Disney)\n\nForty-three years after the groundbreaking original TRON \u2014 and 15 since TRON: Legacy at least gave us a great Daft Punk soundtrack \u2014 Disney has somewhat inexplicably gone back for a third crack at a digital grid whose allure is beginning to look a little dim.\n\nFast facts Starring: Greta Lee, Jared Leto, Jeff Bridges, Jodie Turner Smith, Evan Peters, Gillian Anderson Director: Joachim R\u00f8nning (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales) Where: In cinemas now\n\nRival CEOs Eve Kim (Greta Lee, inheriting the mantle of Jeff Bridges's original game designer Flynn) and Dillinger (Evan Peters, playing a blustery, grating variation on the tech-bro villain) are battling to obtain the \"permanence code\", software that will allow their creations from the digital environment to cross over into the real world.\n\nThough there's much talk of AI and its implications, TRON: Ares is mostly just a creaky variation on the previous two instalments, with lots of Terminator-style chases between the bad guys (Jodie Turner-Smith's femme-bot Athena) and familiar musings on technology developing a conscience and a soul.\n\nLee and Jared Leto, as the titular villain-turned-hero, steal some moments amongst the noise \u2014 and erstwhile American Psycho victim Leto gets to riff on Patrick Bateman, if the latter was a fan of Depeche Mode \u2014 but the performers are let down by rote, unimaginative storytelling, proving just how tired this concept has become after four decades of imitation.\n\nStill, cool lightcycles \u2014 and a banger soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails.\n\nLuke Goodsell\n\nOne More Shot\n\nMinnie (Emily Browning) literally changes the future via magical tequila in One More Shot. (Supplied: Stan)\n\nUnto every generation, an anarchic time loop movie is born. The 60s had Chris Marker's decidedly dystopian La Jet\u00e9e. Harold Ramis delivered the rom-com-inflected classic Groundhog Day in the 90s. Christopher Landon leant into the funnier end of slasher movies with 2017's Happy Death Day.\n\nFast facts Starring: Emily Browning, Aisha Dee, Sean Keenan, Pallavi Sharda, Ashley Zukerman Director: Nicholas Clifford Where: Streaming on Stan now.\n\nWith One More Shot, Aussie director Nicholas Clifford admirably adds to local contributions, including 2014's trippy sci-fi, The Infinite Man. The film rests on the gifted shoulders of star Emily Browning, who plays loose cannon Minnie, determined to win back her ex, Sean Keenan's Joe, on New Year's Eve, 1999. Alas, the party crashes when she discovers he's engaged to Jenny (Apple Cider Vinegar actor Aisha Dee).\n\nCo-written by Alice Foulcher and Gregory Erdstein, the hilariously goofy film's loop amusingly hinges on an unopened bottle of Mexican tequila. Much to Minnie's surprise, one shot's enough to reboot the disastrous night again and again, until it runs dry. With this timer ticking down, Minnie gets seriously messy, increasingly going through the motions as each of her redos fizzles. Also featuring Succession guest star Ashley Zuckerman and The Office's Pallavi Sharda, it's heaps of fun with a great big heart of daftness.\n\nStephen A Russell\n\nRoofman\n\nChanning Tatum's latest film is based on the real life escapades of 'Rooftop Robber' Jeffrey Manchester. (Supplied: VVS films)\n\nWho'd have guessed that Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst would make for one of the year's sweetest movie romances? Maybe it's the lack of middle-aged couples taken seriously as love interests at the cinema; on the other hand, it's impossible not to get swept up in the inherent romance of the gentleman criminal.\n\nFast facts about Name of Movie Starring: Channing Tatum, Kirsten Dunst, Ben Mendelsohn, LaKeith Stanfield, Juno Temple. Director: Derek Cianfrance. Where: In cinemas now.\n\nBased off the true story of a real criminal on the run (not unlike Catch Me If You Can, or Robert Redford's late-career gem The Old Man and the Gun \u2014 rest in peace), Tatum's ex-soldier Jeff (no, not that one) is a deadbeat dad who resorts to robbing an impressive 45 McDonald's locations to provide for his family. When he's thrown into prison, he escapes and holes up in a Toys \"R\" Us (rest in peace, again), only to risk his safety when Dunst's kindly employee catches his eye.\n\nDirector and co-writer Derek Cianfrance (The Place Beyond the Pines) portrays Jeff as somewhat pathetic, though Tatum's callow energy and knack for physical comedy keeps him buoyant. Dunst is heartbreaking as Leigh, a kind but no-nonsense single mum who's refreshingly direct about her desires. The stakes inevitably rise, with Jeff's pacifist streak pushed to the brink \u2014 but Cianfrance coolly maintains the film's shaggy charm throughout.\n\nJamie Tram\n\nGood Boy\n\nGood Boy producer Kari Fischer and director Ben Leonbery with the film's star, Indy the dog. (Getty: Diego Donamaria)\n\nLow-budget indie horror Good Boy taps into the mystical power of dogs as protectors who can sniff out harm and presage future dangers.\n\nGood Boy is told almost entirely through the perspective of a dog named Indy, which may sound gimmicky, but first-time director Ben Leonberg expertly inhabits the canine's interiority, from his dreams and fears to his desires and visions. Through Wade Grebnoel's camera work, we witness everything that unfolds from Indy's eye level.\n\nFast facts Starring: Shane Jensen, Arielle Friedman, Larry Fessenden, Indy the dog Director: Ben Leonberg Where: In cinemas now\n\nLeonberg's very own retriever is Indy, the star of the show and companion to Todd (Shane Jensen), a youngish man who's contracted a terminal illness and decides to make a tree-change to his grandfather's terrifically spooky rural cottage.\n\nWe never see Todd's face, deliberately obscured to us until the very end. But there are plenty of close-ups of Indy's snivelling snout and cocked ears, as he becomes keenly aware of a malignant presence in the house.\n\nHorror film staples abound, from creaky doors and unexplained thumps to menacing eyes gleaming in the dark and looming shadows. Kelly Oostman's eerie sound design \u2014 full of incessant strings and thudding drumbeats \u2014 accentuates the impending sense of doom.\n\nGood Boy breathes new life into the horror genre and subverts the play of victimhood by centring its story on a dog in thrall to the whims of his gradually deteriorating owner. Whether Indy is responding to the clutches of death or a supernatural force is deliberately left ambiguous \u2014 Leonberg's debut masterfully plays with the unknowing.\n\nSonia Nair\n\nThe Mastermind\n\nJosh O'Connor as James in The Mastermind. (Supplied)\n\nOne of the finest filmmakers currently working in the US, writer/director Kelly Reichardt doesn't necessarily get the credit she's due for someone easily on a par with the likes of Scorsese. Perhaps that's because her thoroughly engaging films tend to be a good deal quieter, anchored to character beats over action-packed plot.\n\nFast facts Starring: Josh O'Connor, Alana Haim, Hope Davis, John Magaro Director: Kelly Reichardt Where: In cinemas October 23\n\nThe Mastermind stars Josh O'Connor, the eminently charming star of Challengers and The Crown, as James, a chunky knit jumper-wearing suburban dad plotting to swipe contemporary artworks from his local gallery. A dramatic way for an otherwise greige guy to get out from under the boot of his cantankerous dad (Bill Camp) and smothering mother (Hope Davis).\n\nOnly James hasn't thought through what happens next. Rather than enriching his family overnight, it brings the cops to his door, through which Terri (Alana Haim, ace if underused), his wife, promptly leaves, taking the kids with her. Instead, we sit in James' amusingly gormless company on the run. O'Connor ensures we remain rapt by his increasingly farcical scramble. But it's Gaby Hoffmann who steals the show as the eye-rolling wife of his best mate, who will not have a bar of him hiding out on their farm in this ruffled collar, Palme d'Or-nominated misadventure.",

    "text": "To their fans, an Australian tour from alt-metal titans Tool is treated with the kind of reverence typically reserved for the Dalai Lama or the royal family.\n\nIn the country for the first time since 2020, the band is headlining Good Things Festival on the east coast, as well as anticipated sideshows in Perth and Adelaide, where devotees have been waiting for a Tool concert since 2013.\n\nTo that same legion, frontman Maynard James Keenan is equally admired as something like a spiritual leader and well-respected institution.\n\nHis powerful vocals, surreal presence and cerebral lyrics are an indispensable element of a group who've always been stranger and more subversive than most of their peers.\n\nTool is a multi-platinum selling, festival-topping juggernaut whose music defies the conventions of commercial success: dark, labyrinthian songs roiling with primal, hypnotic grooves, devilishly tricky time signatures and challenging subject matter.\n\nMaynard James Keenan (left) with Tool band mates Justin Chancellor, Danny Carey and Adam Jones. (Supplied: Travis Shinn)\n\nThe Los Angeles quartet's painstaking collaborative process means they've produced just five full-length albums across 32 years, their complexity growing in tandem with increasingly longer waits between releases.\n\nThirteen years separated their last album, Fear Inoculum, and 2006 predecessor 10,000 Days. The album also dethroned Taylor Swift from the top spot on the US Billboard 200 Chart.\n\nIt demonstrates how, despite (or perhaps because of) their media-adverse attitude and difficult-to-categorise music, Tool breed cult-like adoration.\n\nAn Oral History of Tool Tuesday How one of triple j's greatest traditions happened, according to the people who lived it.Tool Fear Inoculum Review\n\nHere in Australia, that same fanatical dedication has spawned Tool Tuesday: a decades-long tradition by triple j listeners.\n\nAsked if he is aware of the hallowed tradition, Keenan deadpans: \"Is that like the band Tool? Or is it like, tool, as in idiot?\"\n\nHumour and heaviness\n\nHe's one of heavy music's most critically acclaimed and enigmatic vocalists, but Keenan is also one of its funniest.\n\nHe's an under-appreciated humourist who counts late stand-up legend Bill Hicks as an idol and made cameos in TV sketch series such as Mr. Show, Comedy Bang! Bang! and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\n\nConnecting to his video call with Double J's Dylan Lewis, Keenan jests about being an AI-generated body double.\n\n\"I'm the clone they send out to dodge the bullets.\"\n\nThese kinds of quips are standard tone-setting procedure in most interviews with Keenan, who also fronts rock supergroup A Perfect Circle and Puscifer, a solo project where he exercises his theatrical tendencies and twisted funny bone.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nHe's been painted by music publications as a difficult subject who loves toying with interviewers. In reality, Keenan just prefers to get to the point rather than pontificate.\n\nFor example: What's the hardest song vocally to sing live?\n\n\"The ones I can't sing anymore.\"\n\nWhy is Merkin Vineyards named after the term for a pubic wig?\n\n\"Because I think I'm funny.\"\n\nA grape vintage\n\nWhen Keenan isn't on tour or in the studio, he's found roasting beans with his wife, Jen, at the Queen B Vinyl Caf\u00e9, or running his winery Merkin Vineyards and the adjoining Caduceus Cellars.\n\nIn fact, all his musical commitments are scheduled to avoid clashing with the winery's crucial windows of harvesting and processing.\n\nOriginally dismissed as a celebrity hobby, Keenan's grape-growing operation in arid North Arizona has grown from industry underdog into an award-winning operation \u2014 as chronicled in 2010 documentary Blood Into Wine.\n\nA fan's collection of wine made by Maynard James Keenan's Caduceus Cellars. (Supplied: Grant Lutwyche)\n\nNow 20 years in the business, Keenan is a serious connoisseur who clearly knows his Merlot from a Cab Sav, let alone a bottle of Rockford Basket Press.\n\n\"I have a vertical of magnums in my cellar now, from mid-90s to late-90s,\" he notes of the legendary Barossa drop.\n\nAnd yes, he's also in the habit of playing music to his grapes.\n\nJudith Nebbiolo, a signature drop named after his late mother, whose ashes are spread across the vineyard, is treated to \"Blonde Redhead and Fever Ray [when] it comes in off the hillside,\" he says.\n\n\"Does it help? I have no idea. It helps me focus and get shit done,\" he clarifies.\n\nWhile his friends with cellars will pump \"thrash[y], super heavy, fast shit\", he can't do that.\n\n\"I love some of that music, but I can't play it while I'm on a forklift paying attention to the grapes. It's very distracting. I'm more B-52s or Devo or Gillian Welch.\"\n\nWhen Tool play South Australia, he's hoping to reconnect with old friends.\n\n\"It's been a long time but I used to come to Adelaide to work with winemakers during harvest.\n\n\"I haven't been in forever \u2026 but I generally hang out with the people from Ochota Barrels,\" he adds.\n\nHowever, Keenan is very much business first.\n\n\"I have to make sure I'm prepared for what's expected of me. I can't go tearing it up at wineries.\"\n\nWhat's expected of Keenan is playing enigmatic emcee between guitarist Adam Jones's drop-tuned riffs, Justin Chancellor's muscular bass and the octopus-limbed drum punishment of Danny Carey.\n\nTool's audio-visual quality has long made them a must-see live act among rock fans. (Supplied: Good Things)\n\nSince their 1990 debut, Tool's live show has developed into a full-scale production of immersive sound and psychedelic visuals. It's a spectacle that keeps fans coming back multiple times, even when there's no new material to promote.\n\nLike their music, their performances are simultaneously enigmatic, brutal and intellectual. A visceral experience that's all about \u2014 as Keenan poetically summarised in their signature hit Schism \u2014 \"finding beauty in the dissonance\".\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nA world-class multi-tasker\n\nFamed for demanding performances spanning the melodic to the larynx-shredding, doubters have wondered if the 61-year-old has much Tool left in his voice.\n\n\"Plenty,\" he counters, because he's taking care of it.\n\n\"The big misconception,\" he begins, \"is there's some magic potion or tricky thing to do.\n\n\"There isn't, it's sleep and water and shut the f**k up.\n\n\"That's how you maintain your throat.

Gate five is a big plus, the booking of international jockey Andrea Atzeni is a worry. Ciaron Maher-trained Royal Supremacy (52.5kg) has rocketed into contention after winning The Metropolitan and will be partnered by the singing jockey Robbie Dolan. Not sure about The Metrop as a form race. Punters have also supported Vauban (58.5kg), a former Irish stayer now in the hands of Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott, who ran fifth behind Royal Supremacy.\n\nThe roughies: If we think that the Turnbull Stakes is the best lead-up race, then consideration has to go to Deakin (54kg) and Middle Earth (56.5kg), who finished sixth and ninth in that race.

In another word: quality. \u201cThe Postman\u201d delivered (actually, better than the post). The first two matches of last summer\u2019s series perhaps best showed Cummins\u2019s value through the colour of contrast. In Perth, despite having claimed Pant and Reddy, India\u2019s top two scorers, in the first innings, Cummins was off his game. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli pounced, and India won.

On the second day, India were entertaining hopes for a 2-0 lead until they met Cummins in a lean and hungry mood. He removed Rahul in his first spell, and came back when India were threatening a fightback. His dismissal of Rohit and top-scorer Reddy triggered a dramatic collapse, in which Cummins picked up two more wickets, that swung the momentum of the series to Australia. In other words: the timing of his contributions was as significant as the fact. When India were building a partnership, Cummins gave himself the ball. When momentum needed reversing, it was Cummins putting himself in India\u2019s path and rolling them back to where they\u2019d started.\n\nIn the field, he doesn\u2019t drop catches, and he kept his head in the decisive moment of the Melbourne Test when Kohli and Jaiswal confused each other. The Postman delivered the ball soundly for the runout that sank India. Cummins was top of the world bowling tally, with 80 wickets at 23.48, in the last two-year Test championship cycle, but his batting has been an underrated element of Australia\u2019s success. Against India, his 41 runs in Melbourne were critical to Australia\u2019s eventual win. Cummins has increased his versatility with the bat, too. For some years, he was a rich man\u2019s Glenn McGrath, diligent and earnest as the ball clinked off the sour spots on his blade. Recently, he has taught himself to slog, and his cameo of 22 off 10 balls set up Australia\u2019s daring declaration in Brisbane.\n\nIndia have been Australia\u2019s great rivals in recent Test cricket, but the other form guide to the coming Ashes series is the last one. It, too, reveals a lot about Cummins\u2019s impact. England targeted his bowling, and when they got on top of Cummins in the first innings at Edgbaston, and again in the last days of the series, they also got on top of Australia. Cummins and Sam Konstas celebrate Australia\u2019s victory over India in the Boxing Day Test last summer. Credit: Getty Images While Cummins\u2019 Ashes return was 18 wickets at an expensive 37.72 apiece, 13 of his wickets were recognised batsmen, and his most frequent victim was Joe Root, followed by Ben Stokes and Harry Brook. Cometh the man, cometh the bigger man. He also had one of his best series with the bat, his 162 runs including his match-winning 38 and 44 not out at Edgbaston. This number crunching does not take into account what Cummins\u2019 presence and leadership brings to any team he plays in. Teammates trust his character, and Mitchell Starc\u2019s bowling in particular has benefited from having Cummins at his side. Starc\u2019s resurgence as an attacking force in the past two years owes much to the steadiness of his partner.\n\nEvery Jeff Thomson has needed a Dennis Lillee, and every Brett Lee has needed a McGrath. It must be very reassuring to take the field knowing that there is one player who hardly ever has a bad day. Loading If this glowing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is beginning to sound like a grim prospectus for Australia, it is. It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t win the Ashes without Cummins; it\u2019s that their margin for error gets considerably tighter. Without Cummins, a lot of other parts of Australia\u2019s game have to go to plan. Runs from their top three, which would have been a nice bonus, now become a necessity. And Nathan Lyon, who only had to chime in when needed last summer, will be required to bowl long, tight spells and take English wickets. All achievable, but much harder without Cummins.",

Credit: Mushroom Creative House/Jordan Munns @jordankmunns Mushroom Group and Southern Cross Austereo \u2013 the companies behind Fridayz Live \u2013 were quick to capitalise on this, offering bald caps for $20 as an add-on when tickets, starting at $199.90 plus fees, went on sale.

She purchased hers in May when Fridayz Live announced its line-up. It\u2019s understood Spotlight saw a spike in bald cap sales that same month. Search traffic for \u201cbald caps\u201d and related terms spiked in June, when tickets went on sale, and again in the three weeks before Fridayz Live\u2019s October 17 opening night at Brisbane Showgrounds. \u201cIt is very much a community,\u201d says 26-year-old Amber Kades, who will be wearing a bald cap when she attends Melbourne\u2019s turn with her parents and friends. \u201cIt\u2019s nice in this day and age, where a lot\u2019s happening now, that you can take a minute and do something fun for yourself and not take yourself seriously.\u201d It\u2019s not just the bald caps that Kades, whose family is from Albania, feels unites the fans. It\u2019s the music itself. Some songs are Spanish-language, others bilingual.\n\n\u201cEven my grandparents who don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t really understand, they just love the music,\u201d says Kades. Her father introduced her to Pitbull\u2019s music shortly before she went with her parents, cousins, aunties, uncles and grandparents to the Planet Pitt World Tour in 2012, Pitbull\u2019s last trip Down Under. \u201cWe took up a whole row \u2026 they love the sound of it.\u201d Elsewhere in Marvel Stadium will be 25-year-old Aneesha Dean, whose \u201cobsession\u201d with Pitbull has not wavered from the moment Hotel Room Service was unleashed in 2009.

Where deep knowledge of lore used to be valued \u2013 hunting down a rare comic was no small feat, and that created status and belonging \u2013 social media has lowered the barriers to entry. \u201cBecause information is instantly accessible, the value has shifted from knowing to doing,\u201d says Baulch, who has a PhD in media communications. \u201cIt\u2019s about performing fandom, being creative, and showing your connection through participation rather than expertise.\u201d Aneesha Dean, 25, finds dressing as Pitbull fun and freeing.

And China wants to talk and we like talking to China, so we have a very good relationship and we're going to be meeting in South Korea in a couple of weeks.\"\n\n\n\nTrump unveiled additional levies of 100 per cent on China's US-bound exports a week ago, along with new export controls on any and all critical software by November 1, nine days before existing tariff relief was set to expire.\n\n\n\nThe new trade actions were Trump's reaction to China dramatically expanding its export controls on rare earth elements.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says he's encouraging US investors to engage in the Australian market for renewable energy.\n\n\n\nSpeaking from New York City, Dr Chalmers says he's been speaking with the biggest investors representing around $25 trillion of funds under management.\n\n\n\n\"Our pitch is that Australia can be a hub, a digital hub in Asia.

    "text": "This article contains references/and or images of a deceased Aboriginal person.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-five years ago today, I was working at the Sydney 2000 Summer Paralympic Games with a team of other Indigenous media representatives \u2014 an unforgettable moment in our nation's sporting and cultural history.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the way out to Homebush on the morning of 18 October, my phone rang.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was my boss in Canberra with heartbreaking news \u2014 Aboriginal leader Dr Charles Perkins had passed away after a three-month illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe asked me to divert to a Sydney hospital to assist the Perkins family with the wave of media calls and enquiries that were already coming in.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, Perkins was a Commissioner with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), where I worked, although my family had known the Perkins family since the late 1970s.\n\n\n\nI met the family at the hospital, took over the media requests, and later that day we gathered at their inner-city home.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the following hours, countless friends, extended family, community leaders and people from all walks of life came by to offer condolences and support to his wife Eileen and their children \u2014 Hetti, Rachel and Adam.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins' passing led the national news that day across print, television and radio.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe family decided to make a statement later that afternoon to the increasing number of media outlets now camped outside the family house.\n\n\n\n\n\nHetti, Rachel, Adam and I adjourned to the study to draft the words that would be shared publicly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a moment heavy with emotion, as the family sought to honour their father with dignity while facing an overwhelming outpouring of grief and attention from across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does a short statement encapsulate his extraordinary life?\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins was such a fearless spokesman and renowned activist for Aboriginal rights \u2014 many referred to him as Australia's Nelson Mandela for his similar fight against racial discrimination and for civil rights.\n\n\n\nThe handwritten note prepared by Perkins' family to announce his passing. Credit: John Paul Janke He was born at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station Aboriginal Reserve in the Northern Territory in 1936.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the age of 10, he was sent to a home for boys in Adelaide, where he completed his schooling.\n\n\n\n\n\nA talented soccer player, Perkins played as a professional with English club Everton.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn his return to Australia, he played with the Croatian club, Adelaide and the Pan-Hellenic club, Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile studying at the University of Sydney, Perkins became increasingly active in Indigenous rights issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1965 he gained notoriety by leading a group of fellow students on the Freedom Ride \u2014 a tour of rural NSW centres to highlight the discrimination that existed for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in many country towns.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins was one of the early leaders for Aboriginal rights and will be particularly remembered for leading the freedom rides in the 1960s.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE On the 60th anniversary of the Freedom Ride, Walgett locals reflect on its enduring legacy\n\nThe Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs in Sydney, which Perkins played a significant role in establishing in the 1960s, spawned a new generation of Aboriginal activists.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins combined activism and public service into one.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis appointment as the first Indigenous senior executive in the Australian Public Service in the 1970s, his leadership as a departmental head and chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission in the 1980s, and his work as ATSIC commissioner all confirmed his place in the forefront of modern Australian history.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the age of 55, he was initiated as an Arrernte wadi, a man at the beginning of his journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor his children, his bureaucratic achievements spoke for themselves \u2014 they wanted their words to focus on the gift of a kidney that extended their dad's life.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of his passing, Perkins was the longest post-transplant survivor in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement in hand, we walked out to face the large media pack that had gathered outside their house.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameras, microphones, and reporters filled the street. Aboriginal leader Christine Williams, then deputy chair of ATSIC's Sydney Regional Council, spoke first.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams reflected on knowing Perkins since she was 11 years old, saying: \"He ruffled and plucked some feathers, whatever had to be done. He was listened to because he said it with a heart and he meant what he said \u2014 and he walked alongside his people, not above them.\"\n\n\n\nFor decades, Charles Perkins combined Indigenous activism and public service into one. Source: Supplied The Perkins children huddled together, standing side by side \u2014 stoic, proud, and with a quiet strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen his eldest daughter Hetti spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dr Charles Nelson Perkins, Arrernte and Kalkadoon man, passed away today at about 10am from complications related to renal failure,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was surrounded by his family and friends in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The last 30 years of his life were made possible by a kidney donation. This generous gift allowed him to continue his fight for justice for his people. All Australians can draw strength from his legacy to continue in striving towards achieving recognition for the rights of Indigenous people,\" she continued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Charlie's spirit remains with us, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia,\" Hetti concluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameras flashed as we returned to the house.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo this day, Perkins is still remembered as a man who dedicated his life to achieving justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia, a renowned activist, fearless spokesperson; a man who loved his culture and his family.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe never backed down from his beliefs, nor compromised them.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe fought tirelessly for Indigenous rights, equality, and self-determination.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis courage, leadership, and vision helped transform Australia's understanding of justice and reconciliation, leaving a powerful legacy for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins was buried with a state funeral on 25 October at Sydney Town Hall.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the inside of the service booklet from his state funeral was a quote that remains just as relevant today.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt read: \"My expectation of a good Australia is when white people would be proud to speak an Aboriginal language, when they realise that Aboriginal culture and all that goes with it, philosophy, art, language, kinship, is all part of their heritage. And that is the most unbelievable thing of all, that it's all there waiting for us all. White people can inherit 40,000 or 60,000 years of culture, and all they have to do is reach out and ask for it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThose words continue to resonate \u2014 a reminder of the enduring impact of Charles Perkins' fight for equality and justice, and of the unfinished work that still lies ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Charles Nelson Perkins AO \u2014 the champion of champions \u2014 was aged 64.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "New data showing a continued decline in the number of physical banking services around Australia has raised concerns among advocates who say banking needs to be inclusive and accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom June 2020 to June 2025, the number of bank branches across Australia fell by 33 per cent, with a 4.6 per cent drop in the last year alone, newly released data from Australia's chief financial industry regulator shows.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the 2020-2025 timespan, the number of ATMs fell by 47 per cent, according to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA) annual Points of Presence report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report provides comprehensive data on banking services provided to Australians, including face-to-face branch services, other face-to-face points of service, banking services at Australia Post (Bank@Post), ATMs and EFTPOS machines.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Advocates say internet access, security concerns and challenges with technology mean face-to-face banking and cash remain essential.\n\n\n\n\n\nAngel Zhou, director of the Research, Regenerative Futures Institute at RMIT University, told SBS News that while technological advances in banking should be encouraged, they should be happening at a \"balanced speed\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On the one hand, we need to stimulate innovations in technology, but on the other hand, we need to ensure that our finance is inclusive and accessible to everyone,\" Zhou said.\n\n\n\nWhat happens when bank branches and ATMs close?\n\nChris Grice, CEO of National Seniors Australia, told SBS News that despite many older Australians transitioning to digital banking, many find digital systems challenging and some cannot afford or operate smart devices to use banking apps.\n\n\n\n\n\nFace-to face interactions with bank tellers can also be important for identifying older Australians who may be experiencing financial elder abuse, Grice said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the government's 2022 Survey of Older People snapshot, 2 per cent of people aged 65 and older living in the community reported experiencing financial abuse in the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bank tellers have done a great job over time in actually flagging or identifying circumstances whereby a carer or family member, they've basically been pressuring or intimidating an older person in terms of their money situation,\" Grice said.\n\n\n\nGrice added that younger people must also rely on face-to-face banking in certain circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're trying to sort out deceased estates, you can't do these things electronically. They need to see physical copies, they need to cite the copies, as in, original documents,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShortfalls in tech and internet coverage also sometimes necessitate physical services.\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and in-person banking can become crucial to all Australians when banking apps fail, Grice noted.\n\n\n\nAustralia's major banks \u2014 including CommBank, Bank Australia, Westpac and NAB \u2014 have all experienced online banking failures in the past two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhou said face-to-face banking can be essential for those living in regional and rural areas because digital banking relies on internet service, and internet infrastructure in such areas is \"relatively weaker, compared to the metro areas\".\n\n\n\nSecurity concerns and scams\n\nPatricia Sparrow, CEO of the Council on the Ageing Australia (COTA), told SBS News that face-to-face banking also remains important for those with security concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any large financial transaction that you do, it's actually easier to go in and speak to a branch than having to do it all online,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've spoken to people who have done a big financial transaction \u2014 that might be whether they've moved house or whatever it is \u2014 and they're very nervous about doing that online.\"\n\n\n\nSparrow said in-person banking can also feel more reassuring to older Australians, who are the demographic most likely to be targeted by and fall victim to scammers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you've been the victim of a scam, you're going to be very uncertain and not confident to do something online. Going to somebody who can really help you is going to be important,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to recent data from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Australians are reporting fewer scams in 2025 compared to previous years, but reports of financial losses to the National anti-Scam Centre's Scamwatch service have increased significantly .\n\n\n\nBanks 'pivotal' to regional communities\n\nBoth Grice and Sparrow said there are flow-on effects for local communities when bank branches close.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrice said banks and Australia Post are \"pivotal and central to a community and maintaining the prosperity of those communities\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Australia Post is shut down in a town or their bank is shut down in a town, that means people have to go to the next town to do that sort of stuff,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What happens therefore is that normal trade, people who might have a coffee or lunch or whatever, they don't buy it in their local town; they buy it when they have their trip 40 or 50 minutes down the road.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Regional bank closures halted for now; but there's an alternative SBS News 03:58 English\n\nSparrow said bank branches closing can make it more difficult for small businesses in regional areas to operate, and there is a loss of connection for people who need face-to-face banking services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't want to lose the human connection and what's important in the community. I know there's lots of jokes about bankers but it is an essential service and people actually do like going in and talking to a real person and not everything being automated,\" she said.\n\n\n\nGovernment mandate for accepting cash\n\nA list of recommendations published following a 2023 Senate inquiry into bank closures in regional Australia included the government adopting a policy to recognise access to financial services as essential, including a commitment to guaranteeing reasonable access to cash and financial services for all Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate committee also recommended a banking code of conduct or customer service code that included a \"robust branch closure process\" that would include meaningful consultation with communities before a branch is closed and ongoing support for access to cash and essential banking services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, regional and remote areas experienced the smallest fall recorded since the APRA data series began, due to a moratorium on regional branch closures agreed between the federal government and major banks in February this year and running through to mid-2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Albanese government also pledged to mandate businesses to accept cash when selling essential items such as groceries and fuel, with a proposed start date of January 2026.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino announced the government was releasing a draft of those regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We recognise that Australians are increasingly using digital payment methods, but there will be an ongoing place for cash in our society under the Albanese Government,\" Mulino said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrice said a mandate is necessary to keep banks from closing branches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to make sure that there's a follow-through on this particular process; it's important. To have physical cash as a backup is important,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A third of jobs accounted for more than half of Australia's serious work injury claims in 2024, while only three in 10 injured workers across the entire workforce reported receiving workers' compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Australia's Key Work Health and Safety Statistics Australia report for 2025, released on Friday, revealed 188 workers died from traumatic injuries while working in Australia in 2024, with a rate of 1.3 deaths per 100,000 workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, that figure has decreased by 24 per cent, from a rate of 1.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers aged 45 and over accounted for more than half of worker fatalities recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's peak body representing workers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), said while a fall in the fatality rate is welcome, 188 families still lost a loved one last year.\n\n\n\nVehicle incidents accounted for 42 per cent of worker fatalities in 2024. Source: SBS News ACTU assistant secretary Liam O'Brien said in a statement: \"Health and care workers, tradies, factory workers and the people who keep our communities safe are at the greatest risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One death at work is one too many, and our job is far from done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 146,700 serious workers' compensation claims involving at least one week or working time lost in 2023-2024 \u2014 more than 400 serious claims a day.\n\n\n\nWhat did the report find?\n\nSafe Work Australia's report found four sectors collectively made up more than half of the 146,700 serious workers' compensation claims in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose industry divisions were health care and social assistance (19.9 per cent), construction (12 per cent), manufacturing (10.1 per cent) and public administration and safety (9.2 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, those sectors only represented 36.3 per cent of filled jobs covered by a workers' compensation scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, across all industries, three in 10 injured workers reported receiving workers' compensation, while the rest either did not lodge a claim or did not receive compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACTU expressed alarm that seven in 10 injured workers were not receiving compensation, citing barriers in reporting and under-reporting that obscured the actual cost of workplace injuries across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it came to fatalities, machinery operators and drivers represented 61 worker deaths in 2024, with a rate of 6.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers. This was followed by labourers (50 fatalities), managers, technicians and trades workers (28 fatalities).\n\n\n\nIn 2024, machinery operators and drivers accounted for the highest proportion of worker fatalities (32 per cent) and also recorded the highest fatality rate at 6.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers, according to the report. Source: SBS News The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry had a rate of 13.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers in 2024, followed by transport, postal and warehousing (7.4 fatalities per 100,000 workers) and mining (3.4 fatalities per 100,000 workers).\n\n\n\n\n\nVehicle incidents were by far the most common cause of death at 42 per cent, and at least one vehicle was directly involved in the incident in 66 per cent of worker fatalities in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther causes of death included falls from a height (13 per cent), being hit by moving objects (9 per cent), being hit by falling objects (7 per cent), and being trapped by moving machinery or equipment or between stationary and moving objects (both 5 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers aged 45 and over accounted for more than half of worker fatalities recorded.\n\n\n\nMental health claims on the rise\n\nThe report also found that over the past decades, serious claims for mental health conditions have experienced the largest change across any major injury group, with a 161 per cent increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental stress is now the fourth most common cause of serious claims, at 11.5 per cent.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The $3.8 billion reason Australian workers would leave their jobs\n\nThe median time lost from serious claims related to mental stress is about five times the median time lost across all serious claims and leads to significantly more time off work.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health claims also represented the costliest form of workplace injury \u2014 leading to more than four times the median compensation paid across all serious claims.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile men accounted for the vast majority of deaths (180) in 2024 and accounted for 58 per cent of all serious claims, the report found women's serious claims were more than twice as likely to involve mental health conditions as men's.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, women's claims also involved more time away from work. Median compensation paid for serious claims remains 20.4 per cent higher for men \u2014 $17,600 to $14,600.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACTU said unions were calling for greater legislative protection for workers who were exposed to psychosocial hazards on the job, such as violence and aggression, sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Brien said: \"Employers must treat work stress and intensification with the same seriousness as any other health and safety consideration.\"\n\n\n\n",

Drops to 52.5kg and has drawn gate two. A big chance for Jamie Melham to land a major group 1. The horse has been in work since March.\n\nThe threats: UK import Meydaan (56kg) has been targeted at this race on the back of solid UK form. Gate five is a big plus, the booking of international jockey Andrea Atzeni is a worry. Ciaron Maher-trained Royal Supremacy (52.5kg) has rocketed into contention after winning The Metropolitan and will be partnered by the singing jockey Robbie Dolan. Not sure about The Metrop as a form race. Punters have also supported Vauban (58.5kg), a former Irish stayer now in the hands of Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott, who ran fifth behind Royal Supremacy.\n\nThe roughies: If we think that the Turnbull Stakes is the best lead-up race, then consideration has to go to Deakin (54kg) and Middle Earth (56.5kg), who finished sixth and ninth in that race. Don\u2019t discard Japanese mare Golden Snap (53.5kg), while Adelaide River (54kg) has the potential to lead and pinch the race.",

    "text": "Of Cummins\u2019s 25 wickets, only two were tailenders. He dismissed India\u2019s top scorer four times in nine innings, and put paid to India\u2019s biggest partnership three times. In another word: quality. \u201cThe Postman\u201d delivered (actually, better than the post). The first two matches of last summer\u2019s series perhaps best showed Cummins\u2019s value through the colour of contrast. In Perth, despite having claimed Pant and Reddy, India\u2019s top two scorers, in the first innings, Cummins was off his game. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli pounced, and India won. That second innings in Perth was the only time in the series Cummins did not bowl well, and it meant curtains for Australia. Pat Cummins celebrates after dismissing Rishabh Pant in last year\u2019s Adelaide Test. Credit: Getty Images Cut to Adelaide. On the second day, India were entertaining hopes for a 2-0 lead until they met Cummins in a lean and hungry mood. He removed Rahul in his first spell, and came back when India were threatening a fightback. His dismissal of Rohit and top-scorer Reddy triggered a dramatic collapse, in which Cummins picked up two more wickets, that swung the momentum of the series to Australia. In other words: the timing of his contributions was as significant as the fact. When India were building a partnership, Cummins gave himself the ball. When momentum needed reversing, it was Cummins putting himself in India\u2019s path and rolling them back to where they\u2019d started.\n\nIn the field, he doesn\u2019t drop catches, and he kept his head in the decisive moment of the Melbourne Test when Kohli and Jaiswal confused each other. The Postman delivered the ball soundly for the runout that sank India. Cummins was top of the world bowling tally, with 80 wickets at 23.48, in the last two-year Test championship cycle, but his batting has been an underrated element of Australia\u2019s success. Against India, his 41 runs in Melbourne were critical to Australia\u2019s eventual win. Cummins has increased his versatility with the bat, too. For some years, he was a rich man\u2019s Glenn McGrath, diligent and earnest as the ball clinked off the sour spots on his blade. Recently, he has taught himself to slog, and his cameo of 22 off 10 balls set up Australia\u2019s daring declaration in Brisbane.\n\nIndia have been Australia\u2019s great rivals in recent Test cricket, but the other form guide to the coming Ashes series is the last one. It, too, reveals a lot about Cummins\u2019s impact. England targeted his bowling, and when they got on top of Cummins in the first innings at Edgbaston, and again in the last days of the series, they also got on top of Australia. Cummins and Sam Konstas celebrate Australia\u2019s victory over India in the Boxing Day Test last summer. Credit: Getty Images While Cummins\u2019 Ashes return was 18 wickets at an expensive 37.72 apiece, 13 of his wickets were recognised batsmen, and his most frequent victim was Joe Root, followed by Ben Stokes and Harry Brook. Cometh the man, cometh the bigger man. He also had one of his best series with the bat, his 162 runs including his match-winning 38 and 44 not out at Edgbaston. This number crunching does not take into account what Cummins\u2019 presence and leadership brings to any team he plays in. Teammates trust his character, and Mitchell Starc\u2019s bowling in particular has benefited from having Cummins at his side. Starc\u2019s resurgence as an attacking force in the past two years owes much to the steadiness of his partner.\n\nEvery Jeff Thomson has needed a Dennis Lillee, and every Brett Lee has needed a McGrath. It must be very reassuring to take the field knowing that there is one player who hardly ever has a bad day. Loading If this glowing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is beginning to sound like a grim prospectus for Australia, it is. It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t win the Ashes without Cummins; it\u2019s that their margin for error gets considerably tighter. Without Cummins, a lot of other parts of Australia\u2019s game have to go to plan. Runs from their top three, which would have been a nice bonus, now become a necessity. And Nathan Lyon, who only had to chime in when needed last summer, will be required to bowl long, tight spells and take English wickets. All achievable, but much harder without Cummins.",

    "text": "Daisy Pearce\u2019s West Coast are potentially just one win away from securing a maiden AFLW finals berth after crushing Geelong by 31 points in Perth.\n\nFormer Eagles captain Emma Swanson performed an excellent shutdown job on Geelong star Georgie Prespakis and Lucia Painter kicked three goals as West Coast cruised to the 7.8 (50) to 2.7 (19) win on Friday night.\n\nThe result improved West Coast\u2019s record to 6-4, and they finish their home-and-away campaign with games against Sydney (5-4) and Carlton (6-3).\n\nOne more win would probably be enough to seal a top-eight berth for the sixth-placed Eagles, who posted four wins under Pearce last season and have now recorded a club-record six wins this year.\n\nBut Geelong\u2019s finals hopes are all but over after slumping to a 4-6 record.\n\nSuch were their struggles on Friday night, their second goal didn\u2019t arrive until the final minute, despite winning the inside 50m count 33-28.\n\nPrespakis finished with 19 disposals and four clearances, but a lot of those came when the contest was already over.\n\nSwanson wore her like a glove for long periods of the match, with the Eagles veteran finishing with 19 disposals and one goal for herself.\n\nFirst-year revelation Painter was a force in attack for West Coast with three goals and 404m gained, while Ella Roberts tallied a team-high 25 disposals, eight tackles, three clearances and 380m gained.\n\n\u201cVery confident,\u201d Roberts told Fox Sports when asked how confident she is West Coast can make finals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got top teams coming up, so to get the job done against Geelong tonight, we can carry that confidence into next week and know we can beat anyone.\u201d",

    "text": "Pitbull, pictured here in Texas in April, says seeing fans dress as him en masse is \u201can honour\u201d. Credit: Getty Images for 2025 NCAA March Madness Music Festival Pitbull fans went all out in Brisbane on October 17 for Fridayz Live\u2019s first show. It\u2019s the first time Pitbull has toured Australia since 2012. Credit: Mushroom Creative House/Jordan Munns @jordankmunns Mushroom Group and Southern Cross Austereo \u2013 the companies behind Fridayz Live \u2013 were quick to capitalise on this, offering bald caps for $20 as an add-on when tickets, starting at $199.90 plus fees, went on sale. Loading Although critics lambasted the event\u2019s pricing (and Adelaide\u2019s omission from the tour despite being RNB Fridayz Live\u2019s birthplace), fans happily tacked on the extra expense, with the bald caps selling out almost immediately. Now, finding one that can be delivered in time, without paying an arm and a leg, is an almost Herculean task.\n\nLim was not taking any chances. She purchased hers in May when Fridayz Live announced its line-up. It\u2019s understood Spotlight saw a spike in bald cap sales that same month. Search traffic for \u201cbald caps\u201d and related terms spiked in June, when tickets went on sale, and again in the three weeks before Fridayz Live\u2019s October 17 opening night at Brisbane Showgrounds. \u201cIt is very much a community,\u201d says 26-year-old Amber Kades, who will be wearing a bald cap when she attends Melbourne\u2019s turn with her parents and friends. \u201cIt\u2019s nice in this day and age, where a lot\u2019s happening now, that you can take a minute and do something fun for yourself and not take yourself seriously.\u201d It\u2019s not just the bald caps that Kades, whose family is from Albania, feels unites the fans. It\u2019s the music itself. Some songs are Spanish-language, others bilingual.\n\n\u201cEven my grandparents who don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t really understand, they just love the music,\u201d says Kades. Her father introduced her to Pitbull\u2019s music shortly before she went with her parents, cousins, aunties, uncles and grandparents to the Planet Pitt World Tour in 2012, Pitbull\u2019s last trip Down Under. \u201cWe took up a whole row \u2026 they love the sound of it.\u201d Elsewhere in Marvel Stadium will be 25-year-old Aneesha Dean, whose \u201cobsession\u201d with Pitbull has not wavered from the moment Hotel Room Service was unleashed in 2009. She says dressing up as Pitbull is a \u201crite of passage\u201d for any true fan. \u201cDressing up in the bald cap feels almost empowering, feels like whatever men can do, women can do better,\u201d Dean jokes. Amber Kades has been a fan of Pitbull since her father introduced her to his music, just before her whole family went to the 2012 Planet Pit World Tour in Melbourne. Credit: Eddie Jim Kades will be attending Fridayz Live in Melbourne with her parents and friends, but she says she\u2019s the only one of the group who will be dressing up.

Where deep knowledge of lore used to be valued \u2013 hunting down a rare comic was no small feat, and that created status and belonging \u2013 social media has lowered the barriers to entry. \u201cBecause information is instantly accessible, the value has shifted from knowing to doing,\u201d says Baulch, who has a PhD in media communications. \u201cIt\u2019s about performing fandom, being creative, and showing your connection through participation rather than expertise.\u201d Aneesha Dean, 25, finds dressing as Pitbull fun and freeing. Credit: Penny Stephens Brands, such as Netflix with its recent Wednesday Island installation \u2013 a fan event in which Cockatoo Island was transformed into a gothic playground \u2013 and artists, such as Swift, invite this collaboration, building community and commerce (merchandising, streams and ticket sales) by encouraging the fan-created trends. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect collision of bottom-up and top-down forces,\u201d says Baulch. \u201cThe relationship is reciprocal: grassroots creativity drives visibility, while institutional support turns it into a shared cultural moment and financial boon.\u201d",
