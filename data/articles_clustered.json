(Getty)\n\nFrom today, the excise on tobacco rose by 6.8 per cent.\n\nThat means the tax on cigarettes in stick form not exceeding 0.8 grams of actual tobacco content per stick jumped from $1.40 to $1.49.\n\nThat means the tax for a \ufeffpack of 20 cigarettes will rise from $28.06 to $29.97.\n\nThe excise on tobacco products not in stick form, or in stick form exceeding 0.8 grams of actual tobacco content per stick rose from $2158.65 per kilo of tobacco content to $2397.31.\n\nThat's a price hike of almost $240.\n\nBlended tobacco goods are also subject to new duty rates, the amount of which is calculated under section 6AAC of Australia's excise guidelines for the tobacco industry.\n\nTobacco excises have jumped from \ufeff46c to almost $1.50 per cigarette over the last 10 years.\n\nTaxes also now account for about $28 of the average $40 price for a packet of cigarettes in Australia, costing consumers a serious chunk of cash.\n\nBeards, wallpaper and windows: The most bizarre taxes in history View Gallery\n\nREAD MORE: Soy sauce fish containers banned from today in one Aussie state\n\nThat's because imported tobacco goods are subject to customs duty when they're brought into Australia.\n\nThose duties are paid at the time the products arrive at the Australian border and the cost is passed on to the consumer.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAt the moment, there's no \ufefflegal tobacco manufacture occurring in Australia \u2013 but if there were, it would also be subject to tobacco excise rates too.\n\nBut that's not the only factor in today's price hike.\ufeff\n\nSince \ufeffSeptember 2023, tobacco excise and excise-equivalent customs duty have been increasing by an extra 5 per cent per year for three years.\n\nTobacco products subject to the per kilogram excise and excise-equivalent customs duty (e.g. roll-your-own tobacco) are also being brought into alignment with the manufactured per-stick rate.\n\nREAD MORE: Two arrested after alleged attack on cop in Sydney pub\n\nOther tobacco products, including roll-your-own tobacco, are being brought into alignment with the manufactured per-stick rate.

(Supplied)\n\nMore than 60 per cent of \ufeffAustralian men demonstrate basic financial literacy compared to just 48 per cent of women.\n\nAnd for female athletes, that financial literacy gap can be even wider.\n\nNow the Wests Tigers are doing something about it.\n\nThe club has \ufeffpartnered with Pepper Money to deliver financial literacy workshops to its NRLW team, providing education tailored to women in elite sport and the unique financial challenges they players face.\n\nThe gender pay gap, limited endorsement and sponsorship opportunities,\ufeff and a lack of investment in women's codes puts significant financial strain on Australia's sportswomen, especially those in emerging leagues like the NRLW.\n\n\"Their contracts are shorter, their pay is lower, and their financial journey often includes planning for family or career transitions,\" Pepper Money chief executive Mario Rehayem told 9news.\n\n\"They're also building the foundations of a league that's still evolving. That means they need to be even more financially aware and proactive.\"\n\nThe Wests Tigers partnered with Pepper Money to deliver financial literacy workshops to its NRLW team. (Supplied)\n\nThe NRLW salary cap was $1.2 million this year. In the men's league it was almost 10 times higher.\n\nThe men's minimum salary was triple that of the women's ($120,000 compared to \ufeff$41,800) and they earned twice as much per game in the 2025 State of Origin series.\n\nIt's worth noting that the men's code is more established and lucrative \u2013 but that doesn't make the pay gap any easier for female athletes to navigate.\n\nMost have to work additional jobs on top of training and competing, which Bass did all through her first five NRLW seasons.\n\nThe juggle was \"a lot\" and when she joined the Wests Tigers this year she made the risky decision to focus on footy full-time.\n\n\"Not having that dual income from my other job, I'm not earning as much money as what I did last year,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\nREAD MORE: The twisted messages posted by church mass shooter\n\nBass gave up her second income to focus on footy, something few female athletes can afford to do. (Instagram/@itsembass)\n\nThe new \ufeff'Mastering Money On and Off the Field' workshops has been invaluable as she navigates the transition from two incomes to one.\n\nThey teach players how to establish smart money habits during their playing career and set themselves up for a financially sound future after retiring from the game.\n\nOne in three athletes admit to making poor financial decisions, according to the Professional Footballers Australia (PFA), and two in five elite athletes aged 18-34 reported suffering poor mental health as a result of financial stress.\n\n\ufeff\"NRLW contracts aren't the most amount of money [and] I'm not too sure where my income is going to come from in the future,\" Bass said.\n\n\"\ufeffThat's a little bit scary\ufeff, it's an uncertain situation to be in, so Pepper Money did talk to us about that emergency fund as well.\n\n\"So post career, if I do struggle to find work or I'm not working for three months for some reason, like I get injured, I do have that safety net there\ufeff.\"\n\nManaging money is \"a little bit scary\ufeff\" when you're playing in an emerging league without the funding the men's game enjoys. (Supplied)\n\nAlmost 90 per cent of athletes \ufeffneed to find new employment post-career to maintain financial security, according to UNI World Athletes, and it's doubly hard for women.\n\nFemale athletes typically receive fewer career opportunities when they retire than their male counterparts; just ask Charmain Steventon.\n\nShe debuted on the \ufeffAustralian Sevens team in 2000\ufeff, represented Australia at the 2002 Rugby XVs World Cup, and won five premierships with West Harbour RFC, and did it all while working a second job.\n\nWhen she finally hung up her boots, she was fortunate \ufeff to have supportive employers and mentors who helped her secure work.\n\nNot every player was so lucky, especially in an era where financial literacy and planning for a future after footy \"wasn't even on the radar\".\n\nNow the \ufeffWests Tigers Head of Women's Football, Steventon is determined to change that for the next generation.\n\nWests Tigers Head of Women's Football, Charmain Steventon. (Supplied)\n\n\ufeff\"Equalling the playing field is really important, particularly now that the female players are being paid for playing footy,\" she told 9news.\n\n\"It's a long term vision but it will certainly pay off.\"\n\nEnsuring the current NRLW cohort are financially literate will build a strong foundation for future players and set a positive example for the next generation.\n\nFor Bass, who is now trying to plan a wedding on an NRLW contract salary after years of having a dual income, it has been invaluable.\ufeff\n\nShe just hopes the workshops and others like them will be picked up by \ufeffother clubs across the NRLW and other codes of women's sport.\n\n\"It really gives us a perspective on life in general, where our money is coming and going, and how we can properly invest in not just our career right now, but the next 30 to 50 years, and set ourselves up for the future.\"",

(ABC News: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nAt this year's Mundi Mundi Bash in August, Cure performed to a crowd of about 15,000 people with her band, which was formed through the TV show.\n\nSuperband is so named because it is the combination of the two bands from Headliners.\n\nThe supergroup of performers joined a star line-up at the outback music festival, which included the likes of Leo Sayer, Birds of Tokyo and Missy Higgins.\n\n'Visualising' music\n\nCure has an \"invisible\" disability and sometimes feels that she is misunderstood.\n\n\"You can't see I'm disabled unless you're interacting with me; most of the time it comes off as [me being] rude, or not paying attention,\" she said.\n\n\" [It] frustrates me because I feel like I pay the most attention, I try to be the kindest version of myself. \"\n\nHer disability affects her right side, which means she cannot determine how far away the source of a noise is or where it is coming from.\n\nSonnet Cure's other band, Sonnet and the Breadboys, is an electro punk band made up of music students.

    "text": "Plans to extend the southern Gold Coast's multi-billion-dollar light rail project have been scrapped by the Queensland government.\n\nStage four of the light rail \u2014 a 13-kilometre tram track from Burleigh Heads to Coolangatta \u2014 was estimated to cost between $3.1 billion and $7.6 billion.\n\nBut Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie said a Department of Infrastructure and Planning review found that cost could have blown out to $9.8 billion.\n\nMr Bleijie also cited significant community opposition to the tram line being extended further south.\n\n\"This is a line in the sand for the community that we promised we would review it independently,\" he said.\n\n\" The overwhelming opposition from residents on the southern Gold Coast was clear. \"\n\nMr Bleijie said the state government would instead look at rolling out a \"multi-model transport corridor\" including more frequent bus services.\n\nOpposition to light rail on the southern Gold Coast has been vocal. (ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\nGold Coast faces growing pains\n\nThe Gold Coast's population is expected to increase from about 650,000 to 1 million by 2041.\n\nTransport experts have consistently regarded the light rail as a vital way to reduce congestion.\n\nIt would have provided a direct line for the more than 6 million people who travel through the Gold Coast Airport every year.\n\nStage four also would have provided an alternative to cars for residents in growing southern suburbs such as Palm Beach.\n\nBut it also caused significant community backlash, with concerns that the light rail would promote overdevelopment in beachside suburbs.\n\nThere is a light rail station in Broadbeach. (ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\nEarlier this year, the new Liberal National Party (LNP) state government announced two separate reviews into stage four.\n\nIt also undertook a new round of community consultation, which prioritised feedback from residents living along the proposed route over that from other parts of the city.\n\nThat drew sharp criticism from Mayor Tom Tate, who accused the state government of casting stage four in a negative light and setting it up to fail.\n\nMr Bleijie said two-thirds of the 5,600 submissions opposed stage four, while 60 per cent felt they had not been adequately consulted by the former Labor government.\n\nHe also said a shortage of skilled workers in Queensland meant delivering stage four by the 2032 Olympics appeared \"problematic\".\n\n\"There was no money in the budget for Gold Coast light rail stage four,\" he said.\n\nBus depot for Burleigh Heads\n\nThe decision means the light rail will end in Burleigh Heads \u2014 a popular retail and recreational area \u2014 with a new bus depot needed to cater for 11,000 daily commuters.\n\nMr Bleijie said the Department of Transport and Main Roads would determine where that depot would be built.\n\nIt will also examine the viability of a heavy rail link to the Gold Coast Airport \u2014 a project that has been considered on and off for decades.\n\nThe Gold Coast's light rail will end at Burleigh Heads. (Supplied: GoldlinQ)\n\nStage four is not the first rail project the state government has walked back on in favour of buses.\n\nIn March, the government broke a key election promise by scrapping the final stage of the Sunshine Coast rail line.\n\nInstead, a metro bus service will take commuters.\n\nConcerns for environment and amenity\n\nThe LNP's Burleigh Heads MP, Hermann Vorster, said there were considerable concerns stage four would be \"wrecking the environment\" around Tallebudgera Creek and Currumbin Creek.\n\nHe also said the cost would place further burden on Gold Coast residents, with the council potentially being required to pump $1 billion into the project.\n\n\"That's something I'm sure the ratepayer couldn't stomach,\" he said.\n\nCurrumbin MP Laura Gerber said there were unanswered questions about the loss of car parks, property resumptions and how stage four would impact amenity.\n\n\"Our community has been heard, our voice matters,\" she said.\n\nThe bridge over Tallebudgera Creek where light rail stage four would have passed over. (ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\nBut Southern Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce president, Zac Revere, said scrapping stage four \"is short-sighted and will go down as one of this government's greatest failures\".\n\n\"It is a lasting setback for our city,\" he said.\n\n\"Right now, residents stuck in traffic across our city should be asking, 'What exactly is the plan to ease congestion around my home?'\n\n\"Today, we are one step further away from an answer and our state government has no answers.\"\n\nMore than 100 million trips have been taken on the existing 20-kilometre light rail route between Helensvale and Broadbeach since it began operating 11 years ago.\n\nConstruction to extend the line 6.7km further south to Burleigh Heads is underway, with plans to start taking passengers by mid-2026.",

(Getty Images: Daniel Pockett)\n\nHollands twice took personal leave this year and ended the season playing in the VFL.\n\nCarlton finished 11th this year following successive finals campaigns, and has since been linked to moves for delisted West Coast speedster Jack Petruccelle and Gold Coast utility Sam Flanders.\n\nVoss said the Blues would be \"aggressive as we can be\" in the player movement market, with multiple holes to fill on the list.\n\n\"Everyone would love to be able to get another goal-kicker and everyone would love to be able to get a little extra ball-carry in your team,\" Voss said.\n\n\"We've got to shore up a couple of other positions.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Olympic pole vault gold medallist Nina Kennedy is ready to compete at the World Championships, only 80 per cent fit after cramming a four-month preparation into six weeks.\n\nShe's been on a journey of understanding: learning to be vulnerable; learning that there's more to sport than winning; and deciding that in the three years she has left in the sport, she's going to give everything to become the best in its history.\n\nKennedy had hamstring surgery five months ago and has been racing the clock to be fit.\n\nShe hasn't competed internationally since last September, a month after she broke through to win her gold medal in Paris.\n\nKennedy's gold a fitting way for Australia to reach its greatest Olympic heights Photo shows Nina Kennedy pulls a determined face while holding an Australian flag Nina Kennedy has had to fight for every inch of her glittering career, and having conquered the demons that threatened to derail her, she is the perfect athlete to earn Australia's record-breaking gold.\n\nThat gold created history, making Kennedy the first Australian woman to win a pole vault gold at the Olympic Games, and the first from her country to win a field event since Steve Hooker, another pole vaulter, took gold in 2008.\n\nThis week, she'll be named in the Australian team to compete at the Athletics World Championships in Tokyo, which will begin on September 13, her \"season opener\".\n\nKennedy went under the knife after suffering three hamstring strains in six weeks.\n\n\"It was either a three-month conservative rehab, or it was a surgery rehab, also taking three months. So we went down the surgical route, and it feels back to normal, if not better,\" she said.\n\n\"They cut me open. I was on crutches for quite a few weeks, and the fact that I'm rehabbed and back training, and I'm in full force to go to the World Champs, is a massive win in itself.\"\n\nKennedy is still to regain full trust in her body after a series of injury issues since the Paris Olympics. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\nKennedy said she had confidence in her rehabilitated hamstring, but an abbreviated block of training to get ready for the World Championships meant she was getting pains elsewhere in her body.\n\n\"Do I have full confidence in my body as a whole? Probably not,\" she said.\n\n\"I say that because, (in) only training for six weeks, we have been pushing my body to the absolute limits to get to the World Championships.\n\n\"It's not like I can just rock up and see how I go.\n\n\"This six-week process, what we've done normally takes four months, so we've really had to speed it up, and saying that, it creates niggles elsewhere.\n\n\"It creates niggles in my back, it creates niggles in my quad, all that stuff.\n\n\"The loading in the pole vault is absolutely insane.\"\n\nKennedy estimated she was at 80 per cent fitness, which she believes is good enough to win a medal at the World Championships\n\n\"I'm in good enough shape and mindset to go to the World Champs and give it a red hot crack,\" she said.\n\n\"We've really embraced the challenge, and we'd love to obviously get on the podium; that's why people go to the World Championships.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nBut, it's the lessons she said she'd learned through the process of the rapid training block that she believes will help her most in the future.\n\n\"A win in our books is getting to the championships, and saying we've done everything we can,\" she said.\n\n\"You know, there's more to sport than just winning.\n\n\"We're being vulnerable, the lessons I've learned just through this process are insane.\n\n\"We've had the meetings, we've done the planning, we've done the training, we've done the mental preparation.\n\n\"If we can do all of that and I win, then great. If we can do all that and I come fourth, then great.\"\n\nKennedy, 28, revealed she planned to compete until the LA Olympics in 2028, and in the meantime, attempt to break the long-standing world record of 5.06 metres, which was set in 2009 by Russian Yelena Isinbayeva.\n\n\"I see myself having three years left in the sport and I see myself in a position now to be pushing for five metres, to be pushing for that world record,\" she said.\n\n\"I think I'm good enough and no-one has come close to it for a very long time, but I see myself as the best athlete out there, so why not?\n\nKennedy hopes to be able to add to her Olympic medal tally at the LA Games in 2028. (ABC News: Garrett Mundy)\n\n\"I want to finish my career knowing that I've done everything I can, and I wouldn't be saying that if I didn't believe I could do it.\"\n\nKennedy said her biggest challenge as she prepares for the World Championships is balancing her innate competitiveness with the knowledge that she won't be at peak fitness when she takes to the runway on September 15.\n\n\"So, I've really just had to channel my mongrel and channel that competitive person into this challenge of, 'Yeah, let's see if I can do that,' and that is really exciting to me,\" she said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nKennedy famously shared the 2023 World Championship gold medal with American Katie Moon after the two tied for first place, but said she'd become more single-minded since then.\n\n\"I just have this mongrel in me; I have this dog in me, and, yeah, I don't think I'd share again,\" she said.\n\n\"But then, in the same light, like sharing with Katie all those years ago, it was the perfect stepping stone, and it was so beautiful. I would never, ever regret that decision.\"\n\nShe said the comeback from her surgery has prepared her for anything that might come in the future.\n\n\"God forbid if this happened before LA, we have the skills to be able to go through a surgery, go through a rehab, and still rock up to a major championships knowing that we've done everything we can,\" she said.",

    "text": "In a fitting climax to a women's tournament studded with Australian quality, Annabel Sutherland, Nicola Carey and Phoebe Litchfield have piloted the Northern Superchargers expertly to victory in the Hundred final at Lord's.\n\nSutherland delivered yet another fine all-round performance, Carey was voted player of the match and Litchfield the MVP of the tournament on Sunday (Monday AEST) as the trio of Australian internationals all excelled in the Superchargers' seven-wicket stroll over the previously unbeaten Southern Brave.\n\nSutherland finished the job with a straight six, ending up 28 not out, after she had also earlier been instrumental in setting up the Leeds-based team's triumph by taking 2-23 off her 20 balls, grabbing the key wickets of the Brave's top-scorers Freya Kemp and Danni Wyatt-Hodge as the Southampton side slumped to 6-115.\n\nThen all three of the Aussies made the run chase look easy.\n\nLitchfield cracked a two-a-ball 26, with a six and four fours, to lead the way and become the top-scorer of the tournament with her 292 runs, taking her past the Oval Invincibles' Meg Lanning.\n\nThen Carey, who's been a revelation since she joined the team just over a fortnight ago following a tournament-ending injury to the equally impressive Georgia Wareham, took control, clouting an unbeaten 35 off 25 balls with five boundaries as she shared in an unbeaten stand of 60 with Sutherland.\n\nIt enabled the Superchargers to ease over the line with 12 balls to spare, a well-deserved triumph for the side who have been dominant in the second half of the campaign largely thanks to some scintillating cricket from the players, who captain Hollie Armitage dubbed the \"fantastic Aussies\".\n\nPerhaps the most fantastic of all had been Litchfield, the 22-year-old who's played enough brilliant knocks to be presented the player of the tournament gong by former England paceman Stuart Broad.\n\nPhoebe Litchfield was named the player of the tournament after a sensational campaign for the Northern Superchargers. (Getty Images: Matt Lewis - ECB)\n\n\"I'm surprised, honestly,\" Litchfield said.\n\n\"If you'd told me a month ago that we'd be lifting the trophy and I'd be having this [award] in my hands, I probably wouldn't have believed you. So, it's been an awesome month. This is pretty cool.\"\n\nCarey admitted she had not been in the best shape when she got the call to join the team after Wareham's injury, but she quickly got into the groove, ending up with the highest strike-rate of any batter in the tournament (167.79) except for the 173.98 of compatriot Grace Harris (London Spirit).\n\nThe 31-year-old Carey said she had enjoyed a \"wild\" two weeks.\n\n\"A couple of weeks ago, I was back home in Tasmania, doing a cold pre-season,\" she reflected.\n\n\"So to get the call-up first of all was pretty surprising and to finish the couple of weeks with a win, it couldn't have gone better.\n\n\"It's honestly been a whirlwind. I haven't had something like that where you get a message one night, the next day-and-a-half later you're on a plane, then a day-and-a-half later you're on the field. It was pretty crazy.\"\n\nBut the Superchargers didn't forget the contribution of Wareham, the teammate they all got to know as \"Wolf\".\n\nAs they collected the trophy, they brought a life-size cardboard cut-out of the all-rounder with them to share in the victory celebrations.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Carlos Alcaraz has thrilled the New York crowd with a behind-the-back shot on his way to a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-4 US Open victory over Arthur Rinderknech.\n\nThe win on Monday morning (AEST) made the Spaniard the youngest man in the Open era to reach 13 grand slam quarterfinals.\n\n\"Sometimes, I practice it. I'm not going to lie,\" the number two-seeded Alcaraz said about the bit of wizardry he delivered in the first set.\n\n\"But I mean, I don't practice it, like, too many times. Just in practice, if the opportunity is there, I will try. In the match, it's kind of the same. If I have the opportunity, why not?\"\n\nAt 22 years and three months old, Alcaraz is about six months younger than Boris Becker was when he got to major quarterfinal number 13.\n\nAlcaraz's opponent on Tuesday will be 20th seed Jiri Lehecka, a 23-year-old from the Czech Republic.\n\nLehecka advanced to his second slam quarterfinal with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 win over Adrian Mannarino.\n\nEarly on against Rinderknech, Alcaraz closed a love hold that made the score two-all in spectacular fashion. Moving to his right at midcourt, Alcaraz found himself in what appeared to be a bad spot when Rinderknech wrong-footed him.\n\nBut Alcaraz wrapped his racket around his body and flicked a shot up the line.\n\nPerhaps startled that the point wasn't over, Rinderknech hit a volley that landed in the net.\n\nA big smile crossed Alcaraz's face as he looked over at his coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, in the stands.\n\nAlcaraz then placed his right index finger behind his ear, as if acknowledging the spectators' cheers.\n\n\"The people like it; I like playing tennis like this,\" Alcaraz said.\n\n\"My style of tennis fits pretty well to the energy here.\"\n\nAlcaraz wound up taking that set in a tiebreaker. Then, midway through the second, he produced another highlight-worthy effort with a no-look passing winner, racing forward to get to a short ball and glancing down the line as though he was going to hit to Rinderknech's backhand, but instead steering a forehand cross-court.\n\nBy the last game, even Rinderknech was smiling at other next-level strokes by Alcaraz, who has won 54 of 55 service games through four matches this year at Flushing Meadows.\n\nHe claimed the title here in 2022 for the first of his five grand slam trophies.\n\nAlcaraz is into his fourth major quarterfinal of 2025, the first time in his career he's gone four-for-four in that category in a season.\n\nHe lost to Novak Djokovic at that stage at the Australian Open in January, won the French Open in June and lost to world number one Jannik Sinner in the final at Wimbledon in July.\n\nRinderknech was appearing in the fourth round of a major for the first time.\n\nPegula rolls into quarters with a rout\n\nJessica Pegula is back in the quarterfinals of a grand slam tournament, which used to be her roadblock.\n\nThe way Pegula is playing at this US Open, it may be just another stop on the way back to the final.\n\nPegula rolled into the last eight by routing fellow American Ann Li 6-1, 6-2 in just 54 minutes. The number four seed hasn't dropped a set this year at Flushing Meadows, and only once was she even kept on court for more than 1 hour, 15 minutes.\n\n\"Probably the best match, honestly, I've played since, like, before Wimbledon I feel like from the start to finish. So that was encouraging,\" Pegula said.\n\n\"I was just hitting the ball, doing everything well, executing my strategy very well and got through it pretty quick.\"\n\nPegula had been 0-6 in grand slam quarterfinals before upsetting Iga Swiatek in that round last year.\n\nShe went on to reach the final, where she was defeated by Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nBut she wasn't sure her tennis was ready for a follow-up when she returned to New York.\n\nShe had lost four of her previous six singles matches coming into the US Open, and said she played so poorly while practising with Sabalenka a few days before the tournament that she stopped early, opting instead for an escape room with some friends and a couple of drinks.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThings have certainly gotten better since.\n\n\"Like I said, I haven't been feeling my best on court, so to be able to come back and make another quarterfinal here is something I'm definitely proud of,\" Pegula said.\n\n\"Of course, I want to go further and do more and win the tournament, but I feel like just on a personal kind of goal level, I'm happy with the way I've been able to kind of turn some of my tennis around the last few weeks.\"\n\nPegula will face either two-time grand slam champion Barbora Krejcikova or another American, Taylor Townsend, on Wednesday morning (AEST).\n\nThe 58th-ranked Li was the highest-ranked player Pegula has faced in the tournament, but the 25-year-old was overpowered in her first appearance in the round of 16 in a major.\n\nPegula broke her all four times she served in the 25-minute first set, and she had just five winners against 19 unforced errors in the match.\n\nCirstea's trophy stolen from hotel room\n\nSorana Cirstea said the trophy she received after winning a recent women's tournament was stolen from her New York hotel room while she was playing in the US Open.\n\nCirstea pleaded for the trophy's return at the weekend, two days after she was eliminated from singles play in Flushing Meadows.\n\n\"Whoever stole my Cleveland trophy from room 314 at The Fifty Sonesta please give it back!\" Cirstea wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"It has NO material value, just sentimental value. It would be (greatly) appreciated!\"\n\nCirstea, a 35-year-old from Romania, won her third career singles title earlier this month in the Cleveland warm-up tournament for the US Open. She went on to lose to 11th seed Karolina Muchova in the second round in Flushing Meadows.\n\nThe hotel said it had no comment.\n\nAP",

(ABC Rural: Christine Schindler)\n\nInto the pilot's seat\n\nThe son of a horse breeder, station owner, meatworker and cattle buyer, Peter Trembath grew up among cattle and horses in Charters Towers, Queensland and Mount Gambier, South Australia.\n\nHe got a taste of flying when he started working as a vet at Augustus Downs in North Queensland in 1980.\n\nHe left the job two years later and decided to take to the cockpit himself by gaining his pilot's licence, before adventure called him to Zimbabwe to work on cattle stations there.\n\nBut it is not flying 10,000 feet in the sky over the Gulf of Carpentaria with a faulty oil gauge that rattled him the most, it has often been the animals he has encountered.\n\nPeter Trembath at Lone Star Ranch in Zimbabwe in 1983 with Charlie, an orphaned while-rhino calf. (Supplied: Peter Trembath)\n\nOne of the scariest moments he had was coming eye-to-eye with a 4-tonne white rhino, sick and infected from drought, while he was working in Zimbabwe.\n\n\"I was going to give it [the rhino] an injection of antibiotics and I touched one of those [guard] hairs and the 4 tonnes jumped in the air, turned around, looked at me, and snorted,\" he said.\n\n\"I jumped straight up and over what was probably a 7-foot [2.13-metre] fence.\n\n\"It was a bit scary.\"\n\nBecoming The Flying Vet\n\nAfter eight years in Zimbabwe, Dr Trembath moved his wife and three boys to the Northern Territory, where he eventually bought the Katherine Vet Care Centre, 350 kilometres south of Darwin.\n\nIt was here that he became The Flying Vet, when the ABC released a six-part documentary series (with the same name) in 1995.\n\nIt followed his flights in the NT, as he operated on crocodiles, cattle, cats and dogs.\n\nIn one episode was offered a gold nugget as pay.\n\nHe also had the British comedian and actor Michael Palin drop by for a cup of tea.\n\nPeter Trembath has taken a back seat from flying, while his youngest son takes over the family business. (ABC Rural: Christine Schindler)\n\nAs the only flying vet in the NT, he covered 500,000 square kilometres of the northern Barkly and the Big Rivers regions.\n\nWith outback practicality, a pilot's licence and a Cessna 182, Dr Trembath knocked hours off trips to remote cattle stations and townships, flying anywhere from the Kimberley in WA to Nhulunbuy in the NT in a matter of hours.\n\n\"The only way to beat the tyranny of distance is by flying,\" Dr Trembath said.\n\n\"And of course, there's no gates, you never have to open a gate if you're flying.\n\n\" Opening gates is not a clever thing to do, because then you have to close the bloody thing. \"\n\nBig changes in cattle industry\n\nPeter Trembath will be spending more time on his property north of Katherine. (ABC Rural: Christine Schindler)\n\nApart from X-ray technology, Dr Trembath claims not a whole lot has changed for vets in his 45 years of practice.\n\nBut the changes he has seen in northern Australia's cattle industry has been enormous.\n\nFrom the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC), to mustering with helicopters, and a deeper understanding of Northern Territory cattle breeds, Dr Trembath has experienced it all.\n\nUniting with the state, territory, and federal governments, the cattle industry worked for almost two decades to eradicate bovine brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis, until Australia was declared free of the diseases in 1997.\n\n\"The choppers made a difference, then you can get next to almost clean musters,\" Dr Trembath said.\n\nPeter Trembath testing cattle for bovine tuberculosis at Ruby Plains Station, Halls Creek in 1992. (Supplied: Peter Trembath)\n\nHe recalled having to shoot cattle by the hundreds to eliminate the diseases, long days testing animals and watching how the loss of livestock impacted on the producers.\n\n\"It was a big deal, they shot lots of cattle in the bush, millions even,\" he said.\n\nThere was a \"sense of relief\" when it was all over, he said.\n\n\"It felt bloody wonderful, everyone was sick of it, it was such a big job.\n\n\"We were done.\"\n\nThe sheer distances, mingled with a climate that moves between wet and dry, means Northern Territory cattle have to be tough, he said.\n\nThey have to be able to adapt to the environment and walk or run long distances, handle being chased by choppers and be self-protective, and the mothers have to be strong, Dr Trembath said.\n\nPeter Trembath still fills in at work when his son needs him. (ABC Rural: Christine Schindler)\n\nThe next flying vet\n\nForty-five years since his career began, Dr Trembath was now one in a whole fleet of flying vets, from New South Wales to Queensland.\n\nThis year he handed the reins of his vet practice to his third and youngest son, Rupert Trembath, who has naturally taken on The Flying Vet title.\n\nRupert Trembath has been recognised for his own contribution to the NT's cattle industry by pregnancy testing almost half a million cows.\n\nRupert Trembath's contribution as a vet in the Northern Territory has also been recognised. (ABC Katherine: James Elton)\n\nWhile Dr Trembath still fills in when his son needs him for the odd cattle job, he now spends his time tending to the garden and animals on the family's property, a 10-minute drive north of Katherine.\n\n\"I think life is a series of achievements \u2014 not just one,\" he said.",

(ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nMr Tyas said discussions between the two countries around phytosanitary biosecurity measures, which were designed to ensure an imported product did not pose any contamination or disease risk, needed to happen before exporting Australian avocados was an option.\n\n\"What we don't have is the phytosanitary protocols that need to be negotiated between the Australian and Chinese government, and we're keen to see that happen as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nExporting avocados\n\nCurrent major export markets for Australian avocados are Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\n\"We're dominating those three markets, we've got 75 to 85 per cent market share,\" Mr Tyas said.\n\nAlthough these markets were relatively small compared to other exported products, he said there was a lot of potential for growth.\n\nHe said the response from international consumers had given the industry confidence that there was a strong demand from mainland China for the Australian fruit.\n\n\"Last year, we signed a pre-purchase agreement with the Shanghai [Huizhan] Markets to import $300 million worth of Australian avocados, that was their commitment,\" Mr Tyas said.\n\n\"They're keen to actually increase that, so there's no doubt that there's an enormous appetite and enormous potential in China.\n\n\"We just need to get that market access.\"\n\nAustralian avocado growers are trying to break into new international markets. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nAvocados Australia has set the goal for 35 per cent of the total Australian crop to be exported internationally.\n\nCurrently, it is closer to 15 per cent.\n\nSpotlight on north Queensland\n\nMr Tyas said he believed the north Queensland avocado growing region, situated mostly on the Atherton Tablelands, had an enormous opportunity due to its proximity to export markets and the forecast growth for the local industry.\n\nFar North Queensland farmer Lawrence Massasso grows avocados in the Atherton Tablelands.\n\n\"We're hoping that if we continue to open up export markets, the opportunities for growers [are] going to continue to grow,\" he said.\n\nMr Massasso said he was focused on improving the quality of the product.\n\nLawrence Massasso says high-quality avocados are vital to growing consumer and export markets. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\n\"We know that when a consumer gets a bad eating experience, they go off avocados for a week or two,\" he said.\n\n\"In the situation we're in now that we have abundant supply every week, we want people getting a good avocado every week and continuing to buy food every week.\"\n\nThe industry hopes to shift about 500,000 trays of avocados per week, with a strong link between supply and demand.\n\n\"[Growers] feel that we've done the worst of the tough seasons,\" Mr Massasso said.",

    "text": "Trump\u2019s response to the court\u2019s decision was to declare (as usual, in a post on Truth Social) that, if the decision were allowed to stand, \u201cit would be a total disaster for the country\u201d and \u201cthis decision would literally destroy the United States of America.\u201d That\u2019s typically hyperbolic. Until Trump ignited the trade wars, the US economy\u2019s growth rate was nearly twice what it is today, the inflation rate was falling, not rising, and the unemployment rate was at historic lows. If the Supreme Court were to uphold the US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision, there\u2019d be even more chaos and uncertainty than Trump\u2019s trade wars have already generated. Credit: Bloomberg His Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, warned that the appeals court ruling could lead to \u201cdangerous diplomatic embarrassment\u201d for the US. The administration would definitely be embarrassed and other countries, on the receiving end of Trump\u2019s trade extortion, would definitely enjoy that, but it would be the administration, not the country, that would be most severely embarrassed for imposing the tariffs illegally.\n\nThe impacts of the tariffs on US companies and consumers are just starting to flow and they are generating confusion and risk-aversion as companies wrestle with the decision of how much of the increased cost they absorb and how much they pass on to consumers, remembering that the tariffs are paid by the US importer, not (as Trump falsely claims) the exporting country. Loading Revenue raised by the tariffs this year is expected to be around $US170 billion ($260 billion) and peak at somewhere between $US250 billion and $US300 billion a year once their full cost has been incurred by US companies and consumers. It\u2019s a big new tax, albeit that only puts a dent in the US federal budget deficit this financial year of about $US1.9 trillion. It\u2019s that lost revenue \u2013 the big new consumption tax \u2013 that Trump is bemoaning and saying will destroy the US economy. There are things he can do if the Supreme Court were to rule against him.\n\nThe cleanest would be to go to the supine, Republican-dominated Congress and seek legislative support for his trade wars, but that would take time and might face some opposition from the more economically literate Republicans. He could use a different piece of legislation, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to reimpose the reciprocal and baseline tariffs. That legislation hasn\u2019t been challenged in the courts. Section 232 has been used for Trump\u2019s \u201csectoral tariffs\u201d \u2013 the tariffs on steel, aluminium, auto parts and other commodities and that will be used as legislative cover for the tariffs he has flagged on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, heavy trucks, critical minerals and aircraft. That law, however, requires an extensive and time-consuming Commerce Department investigation and the tariffs can\u2019t be imposed solely at Trump\u2019s discretion. A case has to be made for them and Trump much prefers simply to announce a new tariff. Alternatively, he could use the Trade Act of 1974, but that puts a ceiling on the rate of 15 per cent, only last 150 days and can only be used against countries that have substantial trade surpluses with the US. It couldn\u2019t be used for his baseline tariffs.\n\nThere is one other option. Trump, in the event of an adverse Supreme Court judgement, could simply ignore it. Should the Supreme Court rule the reciprocal and baseline tariffs illegal, those on the receiving end of them would face a quandary. Until Trump ignited the trade wars, the US economy\u2019s growth rate was nearly twice what it is today, the inflation rate was falling, not rising, and the unemployment rate was at historic lows. Credit: Bloomberg Should countries like Japan, South Korea, the UK, Indonesia or the European Union honour the multi-faceted deals that they negotiated, under duress, with the administration, or should they seek to renegotiate them? Would Trump find another way to retaliate against them if they tore their deals up? Presumably, if they have been illegally imposed, the baseline tariffs would disappear.\n\nWould those who have paid the tariffs \u2013 the US companies that have imported the duties goods \u2013 seek refunds? To July, about $US159 billion of tariff revenue has been generated, more than twice that for the same period last financial year. That would be messy and, for a government that is right up against its debt ceiling, could push the US closer to the disaster Trump has warned \u2013 or give the Democrats more leverage in negotiations to raise the debt ceiling before Treasury\u2019s emergency measures to stay within the limits on federal borrowings are exhausted at the end of this month. This is a mess of Trump\u2019s own making. He justified his actions as being driven by an economic emergency even as he keeps saying that the economy and stock market are booming and that any evidence that growth is slowing is just \u201cfake news.\u201d",

Those three amigos? Gillon McLachlan (who was not yet CEO), then legal boss Andrew Dillon and fixture/broadcast guru Simon Lethlean. All three were significantly involved in the launch of the Suns ... and all three loved their wine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to have a bottle of Grange on it,\u201d Hutchison quipped.\n\n\u201cOn what?\u201d retorted the amigos.\n\nThis was the deal: Hutchison would give a bottle of 1996 Penfolds Grange to each person for every year that Gold Coast didn\u2019t play finals. But he expected a bottle per person for every year they did.\n\nThe three amigos were in, and they were keen to get more people involved. Some of the invitees were 3AW powerbroker Shane Healy and former AFL executive Richard Simkiss (who now runs Hutchison\u2019s events arm).\n\nIt\u2019s turned out to be a tough 14 years for Hutchison who, it must be said, has blown people away with the way he has honoured the agreement.\n\nEach year, without fail, Hutchison has literally wined and dined the group, handing over a bottle of fine wine to each of the participants and paying the bill for lunch at the end of each season.\n\nThe first iteration was at Scopri, one of Melbourne\u2019s finest Italian restaurants in Carlton. The most recent was at the world-renowned Gimlet, where the lobster will set you back $188.\n\nOne year he even flew the group (in a private jet, of course) to Adelaide for the day.\n\nFor Hutchison, a ruthless businessman who knows how to save a dollar, it\u2019s been a costly exercise.\n\nThere have been other people who have floated in and out of the group collecting their annual bottles of Grange, for different seasons, so it\u2019s difficult to put an exact figure on just how much Hutchison has forked out. But we know there have been at least six people who have cashed in every year.\n\nNow, maths was never my strong suit at school, so bear with me.\n\nA bottle of 1996 Grange (I\u2019ve never tasted it but heard great things) will set you back $1499 at Dan Murphy\u2019s. Six bottles every year for 14 years is 84 bottles.\n\n84 x $1499 = $125,916. That\u2019s before lunches are paid for \u2013 or the private jet.\n\nAnd you haven\u2019t even heard the worst part.\n\nAs the Suns entered their second year under Damien Hardwick in 2025, things were getting a little boring for the participants. They were, apparently, sick of collecting a bottle of $1500 wine every year. So the terms of the agreement were changed.\n\nThe Suns will feature in September for the first time this year. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHutchison was allowed to pick two fringe teams to play finals, with the carrot of a doubled reward if they both made it. The stick? If both teams missed, that would be another bottle of Grange. Each.\n\nWho did he pick? Carlton and Essendon.\n\nThose picks meant Hutchison didn\u2019t collect his bottles for Gold Coast making finals for the first time.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make you squeamish.\n\nAnd it gives a bit of an insight into just how much was riding on that last game of the season for Hutchison, when the Suns had to beat Essendon to secure a September debut.\n\nHad the Bombers somehow pulled off the upset of the season, the Suns would have missed the eight (again) and \u201cHutchy\u201d would have been up for 12 more bottles of Grange ($17,988).",

    "text": "Retail crime syndicates are targeting expensive cuts of meat. Credit: Stephen Kiprillis Loading Grocery giants Coles and Woolworths have been rapidly rolling out anti-theft measures as supermarkets fend off ongoing attacks. The number of threatening situations happening at Coles has risen 28 per cent nationally. Woolworths dealt with more than 6000 violent incidences last year, with Victoria accounting for more than half of those. \u201cIt\u2019s an everyday occurrence,\u201d said Mike Schneider, the chief executive of hardware giant Bunnings. Michael Townsley, a professor at Griffith University\u2019s school of criminology and criminal justice who researches retail theft, said statistics back up the view that organised crime groups are the main driver of the recent uptick in retail crime. About 10 per cent of offenders are responsible for 60 per cent of all harm and loss, according to Auror.\n\nWhile organised crime syndicates exist in both New South Wales and Victoria and are players in illicit tobacco, drugs and prostitution, Townsley, who is a consultant to the National Retail Association, said retail theft \u2013 especially in Victoria \u2013 had emerged as a gainful area for criminals. While Victoria Police staunchly deny the broader industry\u2019s view that organised crime activity, and not individuals struggling with the cost of living, is driving the increase in retail theft in the state \u2013 in fact, the force believes the soaring figures largely reflect a growth in businesses reporting incidents to them \u2013 Townsley points to a key reason why stores in the state are being targeted. A \u201cstanding frustration\u201d from national retailers that Victoria police \u201care a difficult service to engage with\u201d, he said, in stark contrast to in NSW, where \u201cpolice seem to be much more proactive on retail crime\u201d. \u201cThey [NSW] have an intelligence team, whereas in Victoria it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s been much ownership of organised retail crime as a problem.\u201d The figures are a sign that syndicates don\u2019t feel deterred in Victoria, Townsley said, which leads to stores in the state being seen as an easier target. His research has indicated that even crime groups from NSW now travel temporarily into Victoria to steal from businesses.\n\nBaby formula had historically been among the most stolen goods by organised criminals, in part due to its scarcity overseas, while batteries and razor blades were also popular due to their size and weight making them easy to obscure, Townsley said. However, criminals have become so brazen and undeterred \u2013 in part because they know that supermarkets and retail chains tell their employees not to engage with thieves out of safety fears and future workers\u2019 compensation costs \u2013 they now largely work by \u201cswarming\u201d stores, Townsley said. A dozen people might come in and overwhelm the staff in the store, knowing that by shouting, gesturing and outnumbering they are intimidating the staff, while members of the group take goods and leave the store within minutes. \u201cWhen they\u2019re asked to show a receipt, they\u2019re showing a weapon,\u201d said Bunnings\u2019 Schneider. A2 Milk has gained approval from Chinese authorities to sell its China-label baby formula in China. Nathan Halliday, chief of member operations at Sonder, an employee wellbeing platform used by Woolworths, McDonald\u2019s, Guzman y Gomez, this masthead and other hospitality and corporate groups, receives many reports of robberies involving groups of two or three that walk straight up to the till.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a balaclava on, they pull out the blade straight away \u2026 saying, \u2018I want this, give it to me,\u2019\u201d he said. The criminals demand whatever cash is in the till, usually a few hundred dollars, and the entire encounter might be over in under a minute. As criminals get used to walking out of stores without impediment, they have become more prolific. Billions worth of goods are being stolen from shops and supermarkets Australia-wide. Credit: Getty Images Where do stolen groceries end up? The pool of foot soldiers recruited by fully fledged syndicates to coordinate various parts of the black market ecosystem is expanding, with some demographics reportedly looking to make extra cash.\n\nA recent bust of a Victorian syndicate accused of stealing more than $10 million in baby formula, electric toothbrushes, skincare and vitamins led to the arrest of 19 people police identified as \u201cpredominantly Indian nationals on temporary, student or bridging visas\u201d, often on visas limiting how many hours per week they can legally work. Several of those charged had no fixed address, police said. Stolen items are then passed on to receivers who will sell and distribute them. As the demand for cheaper black market goods has expanded, the types of those involved have expanded beyond stereotypical seasoned criminals. As part of Operation Supernova, police arrested a 54-year-old woman at her Springvale home, in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, where officers allegedly found more than $25,000 of stolen goods. Clothing has emerged as a lucrative category. Illegal \u201cshowrooms\u201d of stolen clothes are popping up in private homes, with the locations released to approved shoppers. Electronics, health and beauty products, too, are also turning up this way. \u201cIf you know where they are, you can go in and try on different sizes,\u201d said Townsley.\n\nFacebook Marketplace has also become a favoured destination for criminals to on-sell stolen clothing, in large part because eBay had been collaborating with retailers to address theft. \u201cIt makes you wonder how some sellers online can get an entire store\u2019s worth of clothing new with their tags still on. It\u2019s quite impressive,\u201d said Townsley.\u201c[Facebook] Marketplace has been a massive boon to organised criminals, as it\u2019s not very accessible to surveillance.\u201d Car boot butchers The distribution methods for other goods are perhaps more troubling: syndicates have been able to sell higher-value items like meat and alcohol to willing buyers with ease. Eye fillet beef or lamb backstraps, cuts that command a premium for their tenderness, are the most-targeted goods by organised thieves, Coles boss Leah Weckert told this masthead.\n\nSmall businesses, especially small suburban cafes, restaurants and bars struggling with rising operating expenses including the price of ingredients, are the majority of customers of stolen meat and liquor, according to Townsley. \u201cI\u2019ve heard anecdotes of people selling meat out of their boots, lined with foil and coolers, and it\u2019s local cafes buying the stolen meat. If it\u2019s $50 of meat and you can get it for $20, that makes a massive difference to those struggling businesses.\u201d \u201cSimilarly with alcohol, it\u2019s so desirable with such a high margin when you serve it, it\u2019s a way to create a little extra profit,\u201d Townsley said. Everyone pays the price The true cost of the theft crisis is far more than just financial. Store staff who face dangerous situations or have a knife pointed at them might seem fine immediately, but can later develop anxiety about returning to the workplace.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this huge amount of rumination that happens,\u201d said Sonder\u2019s Halliday. \u201cThey keep thinking of the situation \u2013 \u2018what could I have done differently?\u2019 Or, \u2018why did this happen to me?\u2019 They literally just struggle to actually get to sleep in those moments.\u201d On top of millions of dollars invested into anti-theft technology, retail staff around the country are receiving de-escalation training, which instructs staff to soften their tone and not intervene. Woolworths, for instance, is employing virtual reality technology to simulate real scenarios. \u2018This has gone beyond being a retail crime crisis and actually becoming a safety crisis.\u2019 Mike Schneider, CEO, Bunnings Employers investing in preventative measures \u2013 smart gates, trolley locks, camera scanning technology, lockout buttons \u2013 and employee support programs are starting to see some positive results. Gen Z workers appear disproportionately affected by the violent or threatening incidents, which appear to spike around 9pm, Sonder data shows. Loading\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the theft, it\u2019s actually the absenteeism, the time off work, the rise in mental health workers\u2019 compensation claims that are coming through pretty rapidly,\u201d said Halliday. All of these costs add up and have to be factored in by the employer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the cost of stock loss. You\u2019ve got the cost of paying for heightened security. Ultimately, that\u2019s going to be the customer that pays, right? That\u2019s just the reality,\u201d said Schneider. Bunnings\u2019 senior management receive notifications of aggressive and violent behaviour at stores \u201cevery single day\u201d, Schneider said. \u201c[It\u2019s] just heartbreaking when you\u2019re trying to create a safe and welcoming store environment for your team to work in, and your customers to shop in,\u201d he said.",

Our children are being locked up, our Elders are dying, and our people are continuing to live in a country where their rights are neglected. Their voices and calls for help falling on deaf ears.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing the Gap is a national plan to improve health, education, and life expectancy for First Nations people, but only four of 19 targets are on track.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is expected to highlight progress on 10 of 15 measures at Garma, but the group says that won\u2019t resonate with struggling communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Garma Festival runs from today to the 4th of August in northeast Arnhem Land, on Yolngu country.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAn underworld war looms in Melbourne after the daylight execution of 26-year-old Athan Boursinos, who had known links to organised crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe son of a former police officer, he was gunned down around 9:30am yesterday outside his home in Wollert as he was heading to court, a tactic often used by gangs to ambush rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\nEight shots were heard by neighbours.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective Inspector Dean Thomas is with the Victoria Police.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is deliberate and obviously targeted.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates are expressing alarm at a $400 million deportation deal the Federal Government has signed with Nauru - including human rights lawyer Alison Battison, the Director Principle and Founder of Human Rights for All.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The MOU and the deal that was announced with Nauru on Friday should be a red flag for anyone in Australia who is concerned about our constitutional separation of powers and about the overstep of the executive into the judiciary. Should also be concerned about the secrecy in which this was announced - Friday afternoon, no press release, et cetera.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Affairs minister Tony Burke issued a brief statement on Friday, saying the agreement would \"allow the continued management of the NZYQ cohort\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a group of around 280 people, including refugees and stateless persons, who were released from long-term immigration detention in 2023 as a result of a High Court judgement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court ruled they couldn't be held indefinitely, when there was no real prospect of them being legally deported in the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the ABC on Sunday, Shadow Attorney General Julian Leeser outlined his view of their situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These people have no right to remain in Australia. They have exhausted all their avenues of appeal. They can no longer be detained indefinitely as a result of the High Court's decision, and so they can't be repatriated to their country of origin, and so they can be repatriated to a third country, and I think it's important that they are repatriated to a third country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial legislation was passed last year to enable this kind of arrangement, which will cost $70 million annually after the initial $408 million payment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Director at the Human Rights Law Centre Laura John explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the final sitting weeks of the Parliament last year, a suite of legislation was passed, including powers to give the Albanese government the ability to enter into arrangements with third countries to deport people who are living in Australia, who the Albanese government simply doesn't like. So those powers were given to the Albanese government last year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the government has introduced another tranche of legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What they've now done in the legislation that was introduced last week - that has not yet passed and we would say should not pass - is to take away people's right to procedural fairness and natural justice. So what that means is that people who might be subject to deportation to Nauru won't have a fair chance to explain whether they fear persecution in Nauru, whether they fear that they won't be able to access medical care if they are removed to Nauru, and whether being sent to Nauru would separate them from their families.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NZYQ cohort has been politically contentious since the members were released into the community in 2023 - largely because some have had criminal convictions recorded against them, including for serious crimes such as murder and rape.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore court challenges have also followed, with the High Court also striking down curfew and ankle bracelet conditions imposed by the government after the cohort was released into the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion of the group has often focused on criminal findings against some of them, but Allison Battison says this is a disingenuous misrepresentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yes and that rhetoric just isn't correct. They do have visas to be in Australia and the vast majority are on bridging visa Rs, which are given to people who might have character concerns but not necessarily criminal records, and certainly there is a large number of people within that cohort who have very minor criminal records, including as children, and who have been in the community and not offended for a decade or more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates, experts and some political figures are also concerned that the legislation linked with this deportation deal could be applied more broadly.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator David Shoebridge is the Greens' immigration spokesperson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know what the government's rhetoric is but they're not telling the truth. These laws apply to up to 100,000 people on bridging visas and without protection in this country, it is not limited to just the NZYQ cohort.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura John agrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, the Albanese government would have us believe that these series of laws, this secret deportation deal, is limited only to people in the so-called NZYQ cohort, who are in fact people who have been punished over and over again by the Albanese government, starting first with their unlawful indefinite detention. But the way the laws have been cast that the Albanese government passed last year is actually much broader and could affect a much larger group of people who may become subject to deportation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Shoebridge accuses the government of undermining multiculturalism with its approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On the same week that we are seeing far-right rallies attacking multiculturalism on the streets, we have the Labor party introducing laws in parliament to strip away the rights of natural justice and entering into yet another dehumanising deal with Nauru playing into that same rhetoric of dehumanising people seeking asylum and attacking multiculturalism. But we need to have a government that leads with dignity and respect, and this government is failing on both those measures.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt has defended the deal, adding details beyond Tony Burke's statement in an interview with Sky News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the government now has the opportunity to remove \"numbers in the hundreds, of the NZYQ cohort\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to remember that these are people who have no visa right to be in Australia, and any functioning migration system has a principle, which is that if you don't have a right to be in a country, then you can expect to be removed. This cohort have already had access to judicial review, to merits review, to ministerial intervention, and really now that we have reached this arrangement with Nauru, it does allow for the removal of people who have no right to be in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the government plans to gradually scale up the number of people deported, but didn't give exact figures for the total number of people who would be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebate on the most recent piece of legislation linked to the deal with Nauru is expected to continue soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His enthusiasm is matched by his little brother Liam and sisters Sophie and Ella, who proudly attest that women can do anything men can do on the farm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We learned to do everything here, we've got a lot of freedom,\" Riley says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the early 1930s, the Trotter family has farmed near Minyip \u2014 a small rural town about 3.5 hours north-west of Melbourne \u2014 where Paul and Sarah's children were on track to become sixth-generation farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that plan has been blown apart by news the family received in late June that the Victorian government has approved a work plan for a mineral sands mine to operate on the Trotter family farm, with digging set to start as early as next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implications for the family are profound.\n\n\n\n(Left to right) Ella, Sophie and Riley Trotter.

Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler The 'Donald Project' is a joint venture between the mineral sands mining and processing company Astron Corporation and Uranium producer Energy Fuels \u2014 both of which are foreign-owned. Spanning 1,140 hectares, the mine project will be operated by Astron and is set to become Australia's second-largest rare earth project, the fourth-largest outside of China.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the second phase comes into effect in the 2030s, the Trotters will be forced off their land. They won't be able to live in their newly renovated house and stand to lose 500 hectares of cropping paddocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boundaries of the mine will extend to within 200m of their home, which planning documents indicate will be subject to noise and dust for 42 years, effectively making the house uninhabitable.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Paul and Sarah, the approval of Astron's work plan was \"gut-wrenching\", and having to tell their children was \"very upsetting\".\n\n\n\nSarah Trotter says the Victorian government's decision to approve Astron's Donald mineral sands mine effectively forces her family out of their house. Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler \"It feels exactly like the Castle \u2014 we're the little guy,\" Paul tells SBS News, referring to the classic 1997 Australian film.\n\n\n\nIt feels like you're banging your head against a brick wall.\n\nIn the film, a judge rules in favour of the Kerrigan family, who are fighting to save their home from demolition as part of an airport expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while the fictional judge cites Commonwealth law, requiring property to be acquired under \"just terms\", state and territory governments in Australia still retain powers to compulsorily acquire land \u2014 and in Victoria, the Mineral Resources Act also allows companies with a mining licence to compulsorily acquire land, under certain circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah says the family wasn't notified that the plan had been approved; they only found out when a local journalist called.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is our home,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThe Trotter family say they won't give up their home \"without a fight\". Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler \"My husband and I have worked exceptionally hard and we want to be able to enjoy it and we want our kids to enjoy it, and I just don't think it's right what they've done and how they've gone around it as well,\" Sarah says.\n\n\n\nNot going down 'without a fight'\n\nAs Australia and the world seek to transition to renewable energy, demand for rare earth minerals has surged.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term 'rare earth minerals' refers to a group of 17 chemical elements found in sand deposits, which are used in components of wind turbines, batteries and other technologies, such as smartphones and weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for those living on the land in north-western Victoria, which is rich in minerals, concerns exist over how rare earths mining is being conducted, as well as deep scepticism about the feasibility of environmental rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt former mine sites, visited by SBS News, a dried-up lake and farmland that no longer produces crops reveal signs of environmental degradation. Locals claim that despite rehabilitation efforts by mining companies, a small portion of the land has become permanently uninhabitable.\n\n\n\nThe 'Donald Project' will be the fourth-largest rare earth project in the world, outside of China, and the second-largest in Australia once it starts operations. Source: SBS News Families like the Trotters say they aren't willing to give up their farms \"without a fight\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have had preliminary discussions with Astron about selling their land, with the company proposing to buy it at \"market rate\", but Sarah says that option is hard to trust and impossible to accept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To put a dollar value on this place, I don't think you can. This place is everything to us,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You could offer anything in the world and we don't want it. We want to live here, we want to farm here, we want to raise our family here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, then-Victorian planning minister Justin Madden said the Donald Project would have \"overall economic benefits for the region and the state\" as well as \"net social benefit\" in a report responding to Astron's Environmental Effects Statement (EES), which was approved by the government.\n\n\n\nThe project is unlikely to have significant adverse social effects and should produce a net social benefit to the local and regional communities, provided that potential adverse social effects are effectively monitored and managed Former Victorian planning minister Justin Madden\n\nBut despite assurances, Sarah says the project has caused significant distress for several families, including her own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mental health has probably been a massive issue for not only us, myself, but other people. I think it's quite upsetting to see your best mates bawling their eyes out, just not knowing what to do, how to fix this, where to go from here,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that's the hardest thing. We can't fix it and there's no answer at the moment and no-one has any answers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to questions about community opposition, Resources Victoria says the safety of the community, environment and infrastructure is \"built into key mining approvals processes, such as the work plan for the Donald Mineral Sands Project\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Victorian Critical Minerals Roadmap is supporting the development of the industry, setting the right conditions to deliver maximum benefit across the state while ensuring transparency and regular engagement with local communities.\"\n\n\n\nAstron has also emphasised the project's potential economic benefits, saying in a statement to SBS News it will \"attract new expertise to the Wimmera while developing homegrown skills\". The company says it plans to hire 200-300 contractors to establish the mine's construction, and employ 100 people on-site from 2026 onwards.\n\n\n\nThe race for rare earth minerals\n\nRare earth minerals are described as such because they are typically dispersed throughout other mineral deposits rather than in a concentrated form. In that sense, they are 'rare', but they actually occur abundantly in parts of the world, including in Australia's Wimmera region, which has some of the most significant rare earth deposits in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's something the federal government wants to boost investment in \u2014 as do other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, China holds a significant monopoly on the world's supply of rare earths, accounting for around 70 per cent of global mining and 90 per cent of global processing, according to the International Energy Agency. That lion's share is unlikely to change; however, over the next five years, Australia is on track to become the second-biggest producer of rare earth elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, China threatened to halt exports of rare earth minerals to the United States, amid an ongoing tariff row, after which US President Donald Trump funded billions of dollars of incentives for investors in the minerals, as part of his 'big beautiful bill' .\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth countries have a stake in the Donald Project \u2014 China, via Astron, which is headquartered in Hong Kong, and the US, via Colorado-based Energy Fuels, which has invested $183 million in the venture.\n\n\n\n\n\nVlado Vivoda, honorary fellow at The University of Queensland's Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining, says the US is working with its allies, including Australia, to create \"alternate supply chains\".\n\n\n\nIt has also been trying to build its domestic capacity for some time to compete with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was already started during the Biden administration, and it continued with the Trump administration, where they are pushing hard to produce some of these rare earths at home or get the production started in countries that are friendly to the United States where supply chains can be separated from China,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Vivoda, the western world is \"playing catch-up to China\" but it's not too late for Australia to play a role in expanding global supply chains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia has 8 per cent of the world's rare earth mineral deposits, or the fourth largest reserve in the world,\" he says.\n\n\n\nAustralia is projected to become the second-biggest producer of rare earth elements by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. Source: SBS News Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in April announced an initial investment of $1.2 billion to set up a strategic reserve of critical minerals, including rare earths, which he described as key to Australia's national security \"in a time of global uncertainty\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has also agreed to loan over $2.6 billion to two firms to establish separate refineries \u2014 Arafura Rare Earths mine in the Northern Territory and Iluka Resources in Western Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Australia's push to become a bigger player in the global race for rare earth minerals relies on digging up prime agricultural land.\n\n\n\nDamaged Earth\n\nProponents of mining say the Wimmera can balance its role as a major food-growing region with the demands of mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Horsham mayor Ian Ross says what happened at Iluka Resources' Douglas mineral sands mine in Balmoral, Victoria, should serve as a warning to other communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mine opened in 2004 and ceased operations in 2012, but some members of the community are still dealing with unintended consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mine's EES, approved by the Victorian government in 2002, stated evidence from other mine rehabilitation sites \"suggests agricultural crops on restored soils will be comparable or better than on similar non-mined landforms\".\n\n\n\nHorsham regional council mayor Ian Ross says the community is still dealing with unintended consequences from Iluka Resources' Douglas mine, which ceased operations in 2012. Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler However, there are at least three sites that have not recovered from the effects of mining operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News visited agricultural paddocks within the former mine site that have been twice rehabilitated but still can't grow crops.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss explains this is because the soil has not been levelled sufficiently and water drains unevenly across the once-arable paddocks, which the landowner estimates has cost millions of dollars in lost revenue.\n\n\n\nHorsham Rural City Council mayor Ian Ross says one local landowner estimates he has lost millions of dollars in revenue in land he hasn't been able to crop after Iluka Resources concluded mineral sands mining on it and rehabilitated it twice. The water pools unevenly in this paddock. Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler Iluka Resources says a plan for the second rehabilitation of the site was implemented between 2022 and 2024, and \"included provision for a topsoil stockpile\", which the landowner could use to fix the land depressions.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss also accompanied SBS News to Lake Kanagulk, which is adjacent to the former Douglas mine site \u2014 and no longer resembles a lake. Currently bone-dry, the lake bed is surrounded by trees with watermarks about two metres above the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the mine opened in 2004, Ross says Lake Kanagulk was one of the \"best crayfish fisheries in the state\", drawing in tourists and money to the town.\n\n\n\nLake Kanagulk has been dry for so long that new trees have sprung up in the middle of it, Horsham Rural City Council mayor Ian Ross says. Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler Kanagulk is an 800-hectare ephemeral wetland \u2014 meaning water isn't present all the time and it is influenced by rainfall and flows from other nearby catchments.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in contrast to its typical water patterns, it has been dry since Iluka Resources' mine opened, Ross says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because the headwaters have been cut off now for 25 years, the lake hasn't really had any water in that time,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Iluka Resources is still diverting water away from the lake and into a freshwater dam on the mine site.\n\n\n\nGrazing sheep is less profitable than growing crops like wheat, but Ian Ross says the soil at this property has been too compromised post-mining. Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler \"The ecological damage is done when you don't put water in ephemeral wetlands \u2014 it's quite horrific. There's been no breeding events for any of the birds,\" Ross says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted impact of mining on the lake was judged to be \"negligible\" in the original EES, which stated the lake had had water in it in 2001, but had been \"mostly dry\" for years prior, and only 12 per cent of the lake's catchment would be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nParks Victoria, which manages the lake site, told SBS News it doesn't have records on water levels.\n\n\n\nA picture of the same paddock when it was able to grow crops over 20 years ago.

Iluke Resources says this is because the pit has been used for the tailings of other mines and the pit will be rehabilitated by the end of the year. Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler Thirteen years after operations ended, Iluka Resources is still filling in Pit 23, where tailings from the mine were stored, despite the EES saying the moving and dumping of tailings would \"probably\" be complete within three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss also showed SBS News Pit 19, which he says used to be a plateau but is now a dirt hill covered in patchy grass. This is despite the EES stating the land would be restored to its original landform.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss says Wimmera residents are concerned that mining companies won't be held accountable if they don't follow their own impact statements and are allowed to revise their plans through \"work plan amendments\", which are readily issued by the government.\n\n\n\nThe EES said this would be [the] world's best practice mining \u2026 we got the opposite.\n\nIluka Resources disputes claims made by Ross, telling SBS News they are \"unfounded, inaccurate and being repeated again as a part of an ideological campaign against the mining and processing of critical minerals in Victoria\".\n\n\n\nIluka Resources says it hasn't seen any independent reports proving its former Douglas mine has impacted water levels at Lake Kanagulk. \"Iluka's operations at Douglas have been comprehensively reviewed over a number of years, including 11 reports by independent technical experts and more still by regulatory authorities,\" a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These reports have consistently confirmed that Iluka's operations in Victoria have been carried out in accordance with both federal and state legislative frameworks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIluka also disputes that it has diverted water away from Lake Kanagulk, or created hills where it ought not to have at Pit 19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have not been made aware of any independent scientific data to indicate that our work at Douglas has compromised Lake Kanagulk,\" the spokesperson said, noting that a state government audit of the company's rehabilitation efforts found \"a high level of compliance by Iluka\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has also pointed to a planning permit, initially rejected by the Horsham Rural City Council, allowing it to continue using Pit 23 for the disposal of mineral processing by-products from another of its mines. This permit was granted via an appeal at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIluka says the rehabilitation of Pit 23 started in 2021 and is scheduled for completion by December 2025.\n\n\n\nRebuilding trust\n\nAlong with the Donald Project, Victoria has seven other mineral sands mining projects at various stages of approval, describing the burgeoning industry as a \"once in a generation opportunity\".\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust between some regional Victorians and mining companies is low, says Minyip resident Ryan Milgate, who lives next door to the Trotters.\n\n\n\nRyan Milgate is the Trotters' neighbour. He says he's concerned about potential health impacts from a mineral sands mine being planned 2.5km from his kitchen window. Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler Once operational, the Donald mineral sands mine will be visible from Milgate's kitchen window, 2.5km down the road.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he's concerned his family of four will be impacted by light pollution, noise, dust and naturally occurring radioactive material disturbed by mining, along with the disruption of dozens of trucks driving past daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond that, he doesn't know what the potential health or other impacts may be, because he says they haven't been analysed or communicated to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the community benefits that have been sort of sprouted \u2014 we're very, very dubious of, and yeah, we're just really concerned that we're not being listened to and that consultation has been non-existent,\" Milgate says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe tells SBS News he has asked Astron but hasn't been presented with any scientific analysis on how his lentil crops will be affected, leaving him wondering if they will be unsaleable in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a really uncertain future that we're facing,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThey're talking about the 42-year life of a mine. When that's done, I'm gonna be nearly 90, and my kids are gonna be in their mid-50s.\n\n\"It really does concern us when there's so many unanswered questions around the impacts and issues of living next to a mine for so long,\" Milgate says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it feels like farmers are losing out in the global race for rare earth minerals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's kind of crazy like this huge global race, and it comes down to Aussie farmers, I mean, it's [Australian] government policy as well,\" he says.\n\n\n\nRyan Milgate says he's concerned his lentil crop will absorb heavy metals disturbed by mineral sands mining. Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler In relation to the Donald mine project, a spokesperson for Astron told SBS News that it has sent newsletters to 15,000 locals and held regular community information sessions, as well as fortnightly \"Coffees on Us\" sessions in regional towns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are proud of our consultation and as committed as ever to open dialogue with the community. We encourage residents to engage with us through any of the available channels,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAstron said it will minimise dust and that air, noise, groundwater, radiation and visual impacts will be monitored and shared with the public.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mine will also be subject to regulatory checks, and the company will be liable for additional rehabilitation costs if it fails to meet the terms outlined in its EES.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Sorahan, executive director of the Minerals Council of Australia's Victorian branch, says mining is \"very highly regulated in Victoria, as it should be\".\n\n\n\nJames Sorahan, executive director of the Mineral Council of Australia, says Australians in rural communities will benefit from the jobs created by the mining of rare earths. \"It's enormously scrutinised and looked at extremely closely, and I think that should give communities a lot of confidence. And at the end of the day, mining wants to do the right thing. We are part of these regional communities.\" Sorahan says.\n\n\n\n'We don't know what's going to happen'\n\nEight kilometres outside the regional Victorian town of Horsham, also in the Wimmera region, another mineral sands mine has been proposed: WIM Resources' Avonbank project.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News understands that some Horsham locals have been hesitant to share their support for the mine, fearing pushback from those vocally opposed to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mine has received federal government approval, and the decision to grant a mining licence now lies with Resources Victoria following a community feedback period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifth-generation farmer Scott Johns estimates that, if the mining licence is granted and the subsequent work plan approved, approximately a quarter of his farm in Dooen (a short drive from Horsham) will be directly affected, with pits dug about 40m deep.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the word \"mining\" is not compatible with sustainable farming, because it involves digging something up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't know what's going to happen,\" he says.\n\n\n\nDooen farmer Scott Johns says WIM Resources' planned Avonbank mine will cover about a quarter of his property, once it gets approval. \"Whether they're going to buy the land, whether they're going to lease the land, what sort of compensation we're expected to get,\" Johns says.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Sarah and Paul, Johns wants to pass the land to his children, but WIM Resources plans to acquire it for a 24/7 mining and processing operation over a 38-year period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When [WIM Resources employees] first arrived, we'd been through this before; this area has been surveyed many times over the last 50 years and I suppose we never really thought that it would actually happen,\" Johns says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're talking about extremely expensive land here, the price of this country has gone through the roof in the last five to 10 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 65-year-old farmer says his biggest concern is what will be left behind. He doesn't believe the land can be rehabilitated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't see myself as the owner of this country; I'm just the caretaker.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nRare earths are a group of 17 metallic elements that power modern technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom TVs to smartphones, medical devices, satellites, even weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd they're crucial too for the green energy transition. Solar and wind energy and electric vehicles all depend on rare earth elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Vlado Vivoda from the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland says despite the name, they're not actually scarce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So a lot of them are not actually rare, but they're hard to mine and even harder to separate and process safely. So that's what makes them geopolitically important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRare earths are tightly bound together with other elements in nature and so, separating them is a complex process often involving at least 50 stages.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch operations are expensive, labour-intensive and often environmentally damaging.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so most countries have left the work to China, which Dr Vivoda says emerged as a key player in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China appeared as the ideal candidate to take in some of that industry, to do it at home with a bit more lax environmental regulations. And it was the cheapest place to do all this. Plus China had some of the largest reserves as well of rare earths.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChina now controls the majority of the rare earths supply chain, accounting for around 70 percent of mining and 90 percent processing, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, China imposed restrictions on the export of a range of critical rare earths\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move, which was in retaliation to US President Donald's Trump's sweeping tariffs - exposes just how reliant the world is on these minerals.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Australia, which has some of the richest deposits in the world, is stepping in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we do have a lot of rare earths reserves as well in Australia and it's a matter of bringing all those reserves to production. Australia is a traditional resource economy. Our biggest commodities for some time have been coal, iron ore, L-N-G and some other minerals. Rare earths have been minuscule along with a lot of other critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and so on. I think a lot of potential there for Australia as well to get involved.\"\n\n\n\n",

Until Trump ignited the trade wars, the US economy\u2019s growth rate was nearly twice what it is today, the inflation rate was falling, not rising, and the unemployment rate was at historic lows. If the Supreme Court were to uphold the US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision, there\u2019d be even more chaos and uncertainty than Trump\u2019s trade wars have already generated. Credit: Bloomberg His Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, warned that the appeals court ruling could lead to \u201cdangerous diplomatic embarrassment\u201d for the US. The administration would definitely be embarrassed and other countries, on the receiving end of Trump\u2019s trade extortion, would definitely enjoy that, but it would be the administration, not the country, that would be most severely embarrassed for imposing the tariffs illegally.\n\nThe impacts of the tariffs on US companies and consumers are just starting to flow and they are generating confusion and risk-aversion as companies wrestle with the decision of how much of the increased cost they absorb and how much they pass on to consumers, remembering that the tariffs are paid by the US importer, not (as Trump falsely claims) the exporting country. Loading Revenue raised by the tariffs this year is expected to be around $US170 billion ($260 billion) and peak at somewhere between $US250 billion and $US300 billion a year once their full cost has been incurred by US companies and consumers. It\u2019s a big new tax, albeit that only puts a dent in the US federal budget deficit this financial year of about $US1.9 trillion. It\u2019s that lost revenue \u2013 the big new consumption tax \u2013 that Trump is bemoaning and saying will destroy the US economy. There are things he can do if the Supreme Court were to rule against him.\n\nThe cleanest would be to go to the supine, Republican-dominated Congress and seek legislative support for his trade wars, but that would take time and might face some opposition from the more economically literate Republicans. He could use a different piece of legislation, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to reimpose the reciprocal and baseline tariffs. That legislation hasn\u2019t been challenged in the courts. Section 232 has been used for Trump\u2019s \u201csectoral tariffs\u201d \u2013 the tariffs on steel, aluminium, auto parts and other commodities and that will be used as legislative cover for the tariffs he has flagged on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, heavy trucks, critical minerals and aircraft. That law, however, requires an extensive and time-consuming Commerce Department investigation and the tariffs can\u2019t be imposed solely at Trump\u2019s discretion. A case has to be made for them and Trump much prefers simply to announce a new tariff. Alternatively, he could use the Trade Act of 1974, but that puts a ceiling on the rate of 15 per cent, only last 150 days and can only be used against countries that have substantial trade surpluses with the US. It couldn\u2019t be used for his baseline tariffs.\n\nThere is one other option. Trump, in the event of an adverse Supreme Court judgement, could simply ignore it. Should the Supreme Court rule the reciprocal and baseline tariffs illegal, those on the receiving end of them would face a quandary. Until Trump ignited the trade wars, the US economy\u2019s growth rate was nearly twice what it is today, the inflation rate was falling, not rising, and the unemployment rate was at historic lows. Credit: Bloomberg Should countries like Japan, South Korea, the UK, Indonesia or the European Union honour the multi-faceted deals that they negotiated, under duress, with the administration, or should they seek to renegotiate them? Would Trump find another way to retaliate against them if they tore their deals up? Presumably, if they have been illegally imposed, the baseline tariffs would disappear.\n\nWould those who have paid the tariffs \u2013 the US companies that have imported the duties goods \u2013 seek refunds? To July, about $US159 billion of tariff revenue has been generated, more than twice that for the same period last financial year. That would be messy and, for a government that is right up against its debt ceiling, could push the US closer to the disaster Trump has warned \u2013 or give the Democrats more leverage in negotiations to raise the debt ceiling before Treasury\u2019s emergency measures to stay within the limits on federal borrowings are exhausted at the end of this month. This is a mess of Trump\u2019s own making. He justified his actions as being driven by an economic emergency even as he keeps saying that the economy and stock market are booming and that any evidence that growth is slowing is just \u201cfake news.\u201d",

    "text": "In 14 seasons of football, the Gold Coast Suns\u2019 lack of success has cost the competition a great deal.\n\nBut on a personal level, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone has coughed up more than media mogul Craig Hutchison.\n\nIt all started late in 2010, on the balcony of the sun-drenched Burleigh Pavilion. Hutchison - who didn\u2019t wield the power and influence he does now - was overheard scoffing at the amount of concessions that had been handed to the Suns, who were due to enter the competition the following season.\n\nGillon McLachlan, Simon Lethlean and Andrew Dillon were on the receiving end of several bottles of Grange from Craig Hutchison. Credit: Marija Erceovac\n\nSo convinced was Hutchison that the AFL\u2019s new boys would be too successful, too soon, that he was willing to put his money where his mouth was.\n\nUnfortunately for Hutchison, the three gentlemen who just happened to overhear his pronouncement had a particular interest in football. Those three amigos? Gillon McLachlan (who was not yet CEO), then legal boss Andrew Dillon and fixture/broadcast guru Simon Lethlean. All three were significantly involved in the launch of the Suns ... and all three loved their wine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to have a bottle of Grange on it,\u201d Hutchison quipped.\n\n\u201cOn what?\u201d retorted the amigos.\n\nThis was the deal: Hutchison would give a bottle of 1996 Penfolds Grange to each person for every year that Gold Coast didn\u2019t play finals. But he expected a bottle per person for every year they did.\n\nThe three amigos were in, and they were keen to get more people involved. Some of the invitees were 3AW powerbroker Shane Healy and former AFL executive Richard Simkiss (who now runs Hutchison\u2019s events arm).\n\nIt\u2019s turned out to be a tough 14 years for Hutchison who, it must be said, has blown people away with the way he has honoured the agreement.\n\nEach year, without fail, Hutchison has literally wined and dined the group, handing over a bottle of fine wine to each of the participants and paying the bill for lunch at the end of each season.\n\nThe first iteration was at Scopri, one of Melbourne\u2019s finest Italian restaurants in Carlton. The most recent was at the world-renowned Gimlet, where the lobster will set you back $188.\n\nOne year he even flew the group (in a private jet, of course) to Adelaide for the day.\n\nFor Hutchison, a ruthless businessman who knows how to save a dollar, it\u2019s been a costly exercise.\n\nThere have been other people who have floated in and out of the group collecting their annual bottles of Grange, for different seasons, so it\u2019s difficult to put an exact figure on just how much Hutchison has forked out. But we know there have been at least six people who have cashed in every year.\n\nNow, maths was never my strong suit at school, so bear with me.\n\nA bottle of 1996 Grange (I\u2019ve never tasted it but heard great things) will set you back $1499 at Dan Murphy\u2019s. Six bottles every year for 14 years is 84 bottles.\n\n84 x $1499 = $125,916. That\u2019s before lunches are paid for \u2013 or the private jet.\n\nAnd you haven\u2019t even heard the worst part.\n\nAs the Suns entered their second year under Damien Hardwick in 2025, things were getting a little boring for the participants. They were, apparently, sick of collecting a bottle of $1500 wine every year. So the terms of the agreement were changed.\n\nThe Suns will feature in September for the first time this year. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHutchison was allowed to pick two fringe teams to play finals, with the carrot of a doubled reward if they both made it. The stick? If both teams missed, that would be another bottle of Grange. Each.\n\nWho did he pick? Carlton and Essendon.\n\nThose picks meant Hutchison didn\u2019t collect his bottles for Gold Coast making finals for the first time.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make you squeamish.\n\nAnd it gives a bit of an insight into just how much was riding on that last game of the season for Hutchison, when the Suns had to beat Essendon to secure a September debut.\n\nHad the Bombers somehow pulled off the upset of the season, the Suns would have missed the eight (again) and \u201cHutchy\u201d would have been up for 12 more bottles of Grange ($17,988).",

    "text": "Retail crime syndicates are targeting expensive cuts of meat. Credit: Stephen Kiprillis Loading Grocery giants Coles and Woolworths have been rapidly rolling out anti-theft measures as supermarkets fend off ongoing attacks. The number of threatening situations happening at Coles has risen 28 per cent nationally. Woolworths dealt with more than 6000 violent incidences last year, with Victoria accounting for more than half of those. \u201cIt\u2019s an everyday occurrence,\u201d said Mike Schneider, the chief executive of hardware giant Bunnings. Michael Townsley, a professor at Griffith University\u2019s school of criminology and criminal justice who researches retail theft, said statistics back up the view that organised crime groups are the main driver of the recent uptick in retail crime. About 10 per cent of offenders are responsible for 60 per cent of all harm and loss, according to Auror.\n\nWhile organised crime syndicates exist in both New South Wales and Victoria and are players in illicit tobacco, drugs and prostitution, Townsley, who is a consultant to the National Retail Association, said retail theft \u2013 especially in Victoria \u2013 had emerged as a gainful area for criminals. While Victoria Police staunchly deny the broader industry\u2019s view that organised crime activity, and not individuals struggling with the cost of living, is driving the increase in retail theft in the state \u2013 in fact, the force believes the soaring figures largely reflect a growth in businesses reporting incidents to them \u2013 Townsley points to a key reason why stores in the state are being targeted. A \u201cstanding frustration\u201d from national retailers that Victoria police \u201care a difficult service to engage with\u201d, he said, in stark contrast to in NSW, where \u201cpolice seem to be much more proactive on retail crime\u201d. \u201cThey [NSW] have an intelligence team, whereas in Victoria it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s been much ownership of organised retail crime as a problem.\u201d The figures are a sign that syndicates don\u2019t feel deterred in Victoria, Townsley said, which leads to stores in the state being seen as an easier target. His research has indicated that even crime groups from NSW now travel temporarily into Victoria to steal from businesses.\n\nBaby formula had historically been among the most stolen goods by organised criminals, in part due to its scarcity overseas, while batteries and razor blades were also popular due to their size and weight making them easy to obscure, Townsley said. However, criminals have become so brazen and undeterred \u2013 in part because they know that supermarkets and retail chains tell their employees not to engage with thieves out of safety fears and future workers\u2019 compensation costs \u2013 they now largely work by \u201cswarming\u201d stores, Townsley said. A dozen people might come in and overwhelm the staff in the store, knowing that by shouting, gesturing and outnumbering they are intimidating the staff, while members of the group take goods and leave the store within minutes. \u201cWhen they\u2019re asked to show a receipt, they\u2019re showing a weapon,\u201d said Bunnings\u2019 Schneider. A2 Milk has gained approval from Chinese authorities to sell its China-label baby formula in China. Nathan Halliday, chief of member operations at Sonder, an employee wellbeing platform used by Woolworths, McDonald\u2019s, Guzman y Gomez, this masthead and other hospitality and corporate groups, receives many reports of robberies involving groups of two or three that walk straight up to the till.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a balaclava on, they pull out the blade straight away \u2026 saying, \u2018I want this, give it to me,\u2019\u201d he said. The criminals demand whatever cash is in the till, usually a few hundred dollars, and the entire encounter might be over in under a minute. As criminals get used to walking out of stores without impediment, they have become more prolific. Billions worth of goods are being stolen from shops and supermarkets Australia-wide. Credit: Getty Images Where do stolen groceries end up? The pool of foot soldiers recruited by fully fledged syndicates to coordinate various parts of the black market ecosystem is expanding, with some demographics reportedly looking to make extra cash.\n\nA recent bust of a Victorian syndicate accused of stealing more than $10 million in baby formula, electric toothbrushes, skincare and vitamins led to the arrest of 19 people police identified as \u201cpredominantly Indian nationals on temporary, student or bridging visas\u201d, often on visas limiting how many hours per week they can legally work. Several of those charged had no fixed address, police said. Stolen items are then passed on to receivers who will sell and distribute them. As the demand for cheaper black market goods has expanded, the types of those involved have expanded beyond stereotypical seasoned criminals. As part of Operation Supernova, police arrested a 54-year-old woman at her Springvale home, in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, where officers allegedly found more than $25,000 of stolen goods. Clothing has emerged as a lucrative category. Illegal \u201cshowrooms\u201d of stolen clothes are popping up in private homes, with the locations released to approved shoppers. Electronics, health and beauty products, too, are also turning up this way. \u201cIf you know where they are, you can go in and try on different sizes,\u201d said Townsley.\n\nFacebook Marketplace has also become a favoured destination for criminals to on-sell stolen clothing, in large part because eBay had been collaborating with retailers to address theft. \u201cIt makes you wonder how some sellers online can get an entire store\u2019s worth of clothing new with their tags still on. It\u2019s quite impressive,\u201d said Townsley.\u201c[Facebook] Marketplace has been a massive boon to organised criminals, as it\u2019s not very accessible to surveillance.\u201d Car boot butchers The distribution methods for other goods are perhaps more troubling: syndicates have been able to sell higher-value items like meat and alcohol to willing buyers with ease. Eye fillet beef or lamb backstraps, cuts that command a premium for their tenderness, are the most-targeted goods by organised thieves, Coles boss Leah Weckert told this masthead.\n\nSmall businesses, especially small suburban cafes, restaurants and bars struggling with rising operating expenses including the price of ingredients, are the majority of customers of stolen meat and liquor, according to Townsley. \u201cI\u2019ve heard anecdotes of people selling meat out of their boots, lined with foil and coolers, and it\u2019s local cafes buying the stolen meat. If it\u2019s $50 of meat and you can get it for $20, that makes a massive difference to those struggling businesses.\u201d \u201cSimilarly with alcohol, it\u2019s so desirable with such a high margin when you serve it, it\u2019s a way to create a little extra profit,\u201d Townsley said. Everyone pays the price The true cost of the theft crisis is far more than just financial. Store staff who face dangerous situations or have a knife pointed at them might seem fine immediately, but can later develop anxiety about returning to the workplace.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this huge amount of rumination that happens,\u201d said Sonder\u2019s Halliday. \u201cThey keep thinking of the situation \u2013 \u2018what could I have done differently?\u2019 Or, \u2018why did this happen to me?\u2019 They literally just struggle to actually get to sleep in those moments.\u201d On top of millions of dollars invested into anti-theft technology, retail staff around the country are receiving de-escalation training, which instructs staff to soften their tone and not intervene. Woolworths, for instance, is employing virtual reality technology to simulate real scenarios. \u2018This has gone beyond being a retail crime crisis and actually becoming a safety crisis.\u2019 Mike Schneider, CEO, Bunnings Employers investing in preventative measures \u2013 smart gates, trolley locks, camera scanning technology, lockout buttons \u2013 and employee support programs are starting to see some positive results. Gen Z workers appear disproportionately affected by the violent or threatening incidents, which appear to spike around 9pm, Sonder data shows. Loading\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the theft, it\u2019s actually the absenteeism, the time off work, the rise in mental health workers\u2019 compensation claims that are coming through pretty rapidly,\u201d said Halliday. All of these costs add up and have to be factored in by the employer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the cost of stock loss. You\u2019ve got the cost of paying for heightened security. Ultimately, that\u2019s going to be the customer that pays, right? That\u2019s just the reality,\u201d said Schneider. Bunnings\u2019 senior management receive notifications of aggressive and violent behaviour at stores \u201cevery single day\u201d, Schneider said. \u201c[It\u2019s] just heartbreaking when you\u2019re trying to create a safe and welcoming store environment for your team to work in, and your customers to shop in,\u201d he said.",

Credit: Marta Pascual Juanola\n\nA total of 7074 ramping hours were recorded in August, beating the previous record of 7007 set in July.\n\nRoyal Perth Hospital recorded the highest number of ramping hours, followed by Fiona Stanley Hospital and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.\n\nRamping, caused by a shortage of available beds and staff in hospitals, leaves paramedics unable to attend to other call-outs while they wait, sometimes hours, for their patient to be admitted.\n\nThe state is experiencing a higher than usual flu season, with dozens of category two and three elective surgeries delayed recently in an attempt to free up more beds for emergency patients.\n\nWA opposition leader, Basil Zempilas, said the figures showed WA\u2019s health system crisis was getting worse.\n\n\u201cBehind everyone one of those 7074 hours is a sick, injured or dying family member or loved one of somebody in the West Australian community, and this is shameful in a state as wealthy as WA,\u201d he told Radio 6PR this morning.",

    "text": "After soy sauce fish containers were banned in South Australia, an alternative was spotted in sushi shops and consumers are not impressed.\n\nTikTokker Dylan Catalano took to social media to share his disappointment over the soy sauce fish ban. Source: Dylan Catalano/Courtney Greatrex\n\nAs South Australia becomes the first place in the world to ban those pesky little soy sauce fish as part of a plan to reduce single-use plastics, a leading sustainability expert has issued a plea to sushi stores.\n\nJeff Angel, the founder of the Total Environment Centre, is calling on restaurants to offer bottled soy sauce, rather than just switching to another disposable plastic alternative.\n\n\u201cAny decision to produce another tiny little bit of so-called convenient plastic containing a consumable product needs to be rigorously assessed, and more than likely not done,\u201d he told Yahoo News.\n\n\u201cSingle-use plastic is a plague, and we have to take comprehensive action to get rid of it.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder South Australia\u2019s new regulations, soft plastic squeeze packets will still be permitted. A video on TikTok with over 256,000 views shows one of these alternatives sitting in a tub that used to contain soy sauce fish.\n\nThe new sachets contain less plastic than soy sauce fish, but they remain difficult to recycle. Many people responded to the TikTok saying they weren't impressed with the change. \"It\u2019s literally still plastic,\" one wrote. \"So they replaced plastic\u2026 with inconvenient plastic?\" someone else added.\n\nA video on social media highlighted that some sushi restaurants have switched from soy sauce fish to other single-use options. Source: Michael Dahlstrom/Dylan Catalano\n\nOther sushi lovers have complained that they tend to be messy to use. \"They\u2019re so hard to open,\" was one common complaint. \"They\u2019ll probably end up being a massive fail [and] they\u2019d spill all over everyone,\" someone else said.\n\nIt\u2019s likely few will be recycled, because Australia\u2019s soft plastic recycling scheme still hasn\u2019t fully recovered since the supermarket-facilitated Redcycle collapsed in 2022.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhether other states will follow South Australia remains unclear. When Yahoo News quizzed NSW Environment Minister Penny Sharpe on the matter last week, she said the government will have \u201cmore to say\u201d later in the year.\n\n'Healthy' snack having an impact on our health\n\nWhile takeaway sushi is considered a healthy snack, the single-use plastic associated with its sale is a human health concern.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget that plastic in the environment, which is absorbed into our bodies is generated by us,\u201d Angel said.\n\nWhen plastic enters the environment, it breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, which humans absorb. In the ocean, tiny plastics are consumed by the fish that we eat. On land, it\u2019s absorbed by plants and animals, and research published this year showed that there\u2019s so much in the air, we\u2019re breathing in 68,000 of these particles a day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlong with sushi fish, straws attached to juice boxes, and cutlery attached to food containers will also be banned.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
