    "text": "Childcare costs will be reduced to about $15 per day for some families as the federal government scraps the activity test for subsidised childcare from this week.\n\nEligible Australian families will be granted at least 72 hours of subsidised early childhood education per fortnight as part of the three-day guarantee announced last year.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said some parents forking out around $150 per day on childcare would see this daily cost slashed by almost 90 per cent.\n\nEligible families will receive three days of subsidised childcare per week from today. (Getty)\n\n\"What it means for some families, it will go down to $15 per day,\" Chalmers said.\n\n\"Lower-income families across Goodstart will be $250 better off per week from today.\"\n\nOnly families who earn a household income\ufeff below $535,279 per year are eligible for the scheme.\n\nAround 100,000 families will benefit, Chalmers said.\n\nA family earning an annual household income of $140,000 per year will be $10,110 better off after 50 weeks of care, according to the federal government.\n\nThe treasurer described the new rule as the next step towards a universal childcare and early education system.\n\n\"The three-day guarantee recognises that the work that happens here is not babysitting, it's not childminding, it is a really important part of Australia's education system,\" Chalmers added.\n\n\"We work on the basis that if it's good for kids, it's good for families and good for the education system, then it's good for the economy as well.\"\n\nFamilies receiving the CCS do not need to do anything to adjust to the changes, but must still meet eligibility criteria and pay a gap fee.\n\nAround 100,000 families will benefit from the guarantee, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said. (Nine)\n\nFamilies are eligible if they care for their child at least two nights per fortnight, or have at least a 14 per cent share of care, meet residency requirements, and be liable for care fees.\n\nChildren must also not be in high school and be aged 13 or under, except in certain circumstances, and meet immunisation requirements.\n\nThe 72 hours of subsidised childcare can be increased\ufeff to 100 hours a fortnight if the family is caring for an Indigenous child, have more than 48 hours each fortnight of recognised participation, have an exemption or experience exceptional circumstances, or receive Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) child wellbeing, temporary financial hardship or grandparent payments.\n\nFamilies have to meet certain conditions of eligibility. (Getty)\n\nFamilies with an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child in their care will need to tell Services Australia in order to receive 100 hours of childcare, but it's not a mandatory revelation if the family is happy with 72 hours.\n\nDespite the subsidy guarantee, families are still not guaranteed a place with a child care provider.\n\nThey will need to secure a place with a service and may need to pay a gap fee.\n\nMore details can be found on the Department of Education website .\ufeff",

    "text": "The toppling of President Nicolas Maduro has thrust Venezuela's debt crisis \u2013 one of the world's largest unresolved sovereign defaults \u2013 into the limelight.\n\nFollowing years of economic crisis and US sanctions that severed the country from international capital markets, Venezuela defaulted in late 2017 after missing payments on international bonds issued by the government and state oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.\n\nSince then, accumulated interest and legal claims tied to past expropriations have added to unpaid principal, swelling total external liabilities far beyond the face value of the original bonds.\n\nA government supporter holds a banner reading in Spanish, \"Free Maduro,\" during a protest demanding President Nicolas Maduro's release in Caracas, Venezuela. (AP)\n\nVenezuela's distressed debt has rallied since US President Donald Trump came to power in January 2025 as speculators bet on the possibility of political change.\n\nBelow is a look at which entities owe money, what could be included in a restructuring and who might be knocking on Caracas' door to collect.\n\nHow much does Venezuela owe?\ufeff\n\nAnalysts estimate that Venezuela has about $60 billion (approx. $A89.7 billion) of defaulted bonds outstanding.\n\nHowever, total external debt including PDVSA obligations, bilateral loans and arbitration awards stand at roughly $150-$170 billion, depending on how accrued interest and court judgments are counted, according to analysts.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates Venezuela's nominal GDP at about $82.8 billion for 2025, implying a debt-to-GDP ratio of between 180-200 per cent.\n\nA PDVSA bond originally maturing in 2020 was secured by a majority stake in US-based refiner Citgo, which is ultimately owned by Caracas-headquartered PDVSA.\n\nCitgo is an asset now at the centre of court-supervised efforts by creditors to recover value.\n\nNicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima, in a photograph posted by US President Donald Trump. (Truth Social)\n\nWho holds what?\ufeff\n\nYears of sanctions, including a prohibition on trading Venezuela's debt, have made it hard to keep tabs on ownership.\n\nThe largest share of commercial creditors likely consists of international bondholders, including specialist distressed-debt investors, sometimes called vulture funds.\n\nAmong the creditors is a group of companies awarded compensation through international arbitration after assets were expropriated by Caracas.\n\nUS courts have upheld multi-billion-dollar awards to ConocoPhillips and Crystallex among others, turning those claims into debt obligations and allowing creditors to pursue Venezuelan assets to make themselves whole.\n\nA growing pool of court-recognised claimants is competing for recovery from Citgo's parent company through US legal proceedings.\n\nA Delaware court registered about $19 billion in claims for the auction of PDV Holding, Citgo's parent, which far exceeds the estimated value of Citgo's total assets.\n\nPDV Holding is PDVSA's wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nCaracas also has bilateral creditors, primarily China and Russia, which extended loans to both Maduro and his mentor, former president Hugo Chavez.\n\nPrecise numbers are hard to verify since Venezuela has not published comprehensive debt statistics in years.\n\nA protest against the United States' capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, at the Colorado Springs City Hall on Sunday, Jan. 4, 2025, in Colorado Springs, Colo. (Jerilee Bennett/The Gazette via AP) (AP)\n\nA distant restructuring?\ufeff\n\nGiven the plethora of claims, legal proceedings and political uncertainty, a formal restructuring is expected to be complex and lengthy.\n\nA sovereign debt workout could be anchored by an IMF program setting fiscal targets and debt-sustainability assumptions.\n\nHowever, Venezuela has not had an IMF annual consultation in nearly two decades and remains locked out of the lender's financing.\n\nUS sanctions are another obstacle.\n\nSince 2017, restrictions imposed under both Republican and Democratic administrations have sharply limited Venezuela's ability to issue or restructure debt without explicit licenses from the US Treasury.\n\nIt is unclear what will happen with US sanctions. For now, President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will \"run\" the oil-producing nation.\n\nREAD MORE: Teenagers as young as 14 among victims of Swiss bar fire\n\nWhat are recovery values?\ufeff\n\nBonds have returned some 95 per cent at the index level in 2025.\n\nMany of them currently trade between 27-32 cents on the dollar, MarketAxess data shows.\n\nCitigroup analysts in November estimated that a principal haircut of at least 50 per cent would be needed to restore debt sustainability and satisfy potential conditions from the IMF.\n\nUnder Citi's base case, Venezuela could offer creditors a 20-year bond with a coupon of around 4.4 per cent, alongside a 10-year zero-coupon note to compensate for past-due interest.\n\nUsing an exit yield of 11 per cent, Citi estimates the net present value of the package in the mid-40s cents on the dollar, with recoveries potentially rising into the high-40s if Venezuela were to hand out additional contingent instruments such as oil-linked warrants.\n\nOther investors sketch a wider range. Aberdeen Investments said in September it had initially assumed recoveries of around 25 cents on the dollar for Venezuelan bonds, but that improved political and sanctions scenarios could lift recoveries into the low-to-mid-30s, depending on the structure of any deal and the use of oil-linked or GDP-style instruments.\n\nA rally a day after the capture of Nicolas Maduro by US forces in Caracas. (Getty)\n\nWhat is Venezuela's economic situation?\ufeff\n\nRecovery assumptions sit against a grim backdrop.\n\nVenezuela's economy shrank dramatically after 2013 when oil production fell off a cliff, inflation spiralled and poverty surged.\n\nAlthough output has stabilised somewhat, lower global oil prices and discounts to Venezuela's crude prices limit revenue gains, leaving little room to service debt without deep restructuring.\n\nThe recent US blockade of sanctioned oil tankers has exacerbated the situation.\n\nTrump said American oil companies were prepared to tackle the difficult task of entering Venezuela and investing to restore production but details and timelines remain unclear.\n\nChevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela's oil fields.",

    "text": "The Australian beef industry is mourning the passing of a \"giant\" modern-day pioneer who revolutionised the cattle game.\n\nSir Graham McCamley died peacefully in Yeppoon, central Queensland, at the weekend.\n\nHe was 93.\n\nSir Graham lived an extraordinary life, founding the Cattlemen's Union of Australia and helping to develop and promote the Brahman breed, and his influence stretched across agriculture, politics and rural Australia.\n\nAgForce president Shane McCarthy led the tributes for the Australian cattle icon, describing Sir Graham's leadership and integrity as his biggest legacy.\n\n\"They don't make them like Sir Graham anymore,\" he said.\n\n\" In the footsteps of giants we follow, and he was one of those people. \"\n\nSir Graham McCamley was the first president of the Cattlemen's Union of Australia. (ABC: Jacquie Mackay)\n\nMr McCarthy said Sir Graham was instrumental in the formation of the Cattlemen's Union in 1975 and was one of the founding fathers of the Brahman breed as it is today.\n\nHe said during the beef depression of the 1970s, Sir Graham made sure graziers had someone speaking on their behalf.\n\n\"He was the inaugural president of the Cattleman's Union, which in those days played a very strong, pivotal role and he set the standard for other people to follow,\" he said.\n\n\"His influence on the beef industry was incomparable, and the industry mourns his passing and passes on their condolences to his family.\"\n\nBrett Coombs was family friends with Sir Graham before working together.\n\nHe said the cattle baron was an innovator and industry changer.\n\n\"He was always thinking outside the box,\" Mr Coombs said.\n\n\"Living in the bush, we get floods, we get droughts and Graham just never gave up.\n\n\"I just tip my hat to Graham.\"\n\nMichelle Landry and Sir Graham McCamley. (Supplied: Michelle Landry)\n\nMember for Capricornia Michelle Landry said Sir Graham was a legendary figure in the Australian cattle industry.\n\n\"From building one of Queensland's most respected cattle empires and championing the Brahman breed, to serving as the founding president of the Cattlemen's Union of Australia, Sir Graham's lifelong dedication to agriculture and his community was truly remarkable,\" she said.\n\nState MP for Keppel Nigel Hutton said Sir Graham was a true central Queensland legend.\n\n\"Sir Graham helped build the Australian cattle industry and his impact extends across the globe,\" he said.\n\nRockhampton Regional Council Mayor Tony Williams said Sir Graham was \"a giant of our region and our nation\".\n\n\"His was a life well-lived that has left a legacy that will last generations to come,\" he said.\n\nMcCamley cattle empire\n\nSir Graham was born on August 24, 1932, and grew up on a property near Dululu, west of Rockhampton.\n\nSoon after marrying his wife, Shirley, the couple purchased Tartrus Station, west of Marlborough, in central Queensland, which was the start of the McCamley cattle empire, which grew to six cattle properties.\n\nSir Graham McCamley in the saleyards at Tartrus. (ABC Rural)\n\nHe and Lady Shirley were true leaders in the industry. They used the first computer in the state at the University of Queensland and held field days that drew unprecedented numbers to their property, near Marlborough.\n\n\"People didn't know what we were talking about [with] all this performance testing, fertility testing and weight performance,\" Sir Graham told the ABC in 2013.\n\n\"At the '71 field day, we were expecting two to three hundred people at the very most, but 1,000 people turned up.\"\n\nIn 2010, Lady Shirley died in an ultralight plan crash at Tartrus.\n\nSir Graham sold the iconic Tartrus cattle station in 2013 before retiring to Yeppoon.\n\nThe sale marked the end of an era for the family on the property where they had lived for nearly 60 years.\n\nIn 1981, Sir Graham was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Queen's Birthday honours list, for his contribution to the beef industry.\n\nIn 1986, Sir Graham was knighted for his outstanding contributions to the beef industry.\n\nSir Graham had three children and seven grandchildren.",

    "text": "On a tropical island off the Queensland coast, locals love to hate one of Australia's most infamous pests.\n\nFor more than 50 years, revellers have flocked to Magnetic Island for its cane toad races \u2014 placing their bets on which toad will hop the fastest out of the arena.\n\nToad handler Paul Gilligan said the competition, which raises money for a local surf lifesaving club, regularly sees crowds of more than 100 cheering on a winner.\n\n\"It's just something so unique that you don't see anywhere else,\" he said.\n\nPaul Gilligan gets the toads ready for their weekly race. (ABC North Qld: Meghan Dansie)\n\nSitting just 8 kilometres from Townsville, the island has a plentiful local talent pool to choose from \u2014 toads can be found in its parks, waterways and national park areas, as they can across much of northern Australia.\n\nBut one group of dedicated locals \u2014 the Maggie Toad Busters \u2014 are taking a different approach to dealing with the local toad population.\n\nThe group estimates they have gathered about 80 kilograms of tadpoles from waterways. (ABC North Qld: Meghan Dansie)\n\nProject co-leader Peter Illidge said the group was on an eradication mission, aiming to put a severe dent in the island's toad population over the next three years, with a $16,394 grant from the Queensland government's Gambling Community Benefit Fund.\n\n\"We've got a bunch of toad busters out there. The community has been doing this for a long time but we're bringing everybody together,\" he said.\n\n\" We are an island, so there's hope we could eradicate them. \"\n\nBruce Holden and Peter Illidge have taken up 'toad busting' around the island. (ABC North Qld: Meghan Dansie)\n\nMarch of the toads\n\nCane toads were first introduced to North Queensland in the 1930s to control sugar cane beetles, but the species quickly became a widespread pest and is now found across Queensland, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.\n\nThis toad, named 'Toadzilla' was found in North Queensland in 2023. (Supplied: Queensland Museum)\n\nProfessor Ross Alford from James Cook University said the region's islands were no exception to their march across northern Australia, commonly hitchhiking to places like Magnetic Island in vehicles and cargo.\n\n\"There's so much vehicle traffic by ferries that it would be really surprising if they hadn't accidentally been carried over there by people,\" he said.\n\nCane toads breed rapidly. (ABC North Qld: Meghan Dansie)\n\nEuthanasia of cane toads is permitted in Australia, with several humane methods outlined by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.\n\nMagnetic Island toad buster, Bruce Hobby said the group had laid 30 traps in local creeks, collecting and euthanasing about 80 kilograms of tadpoles over the past few months, as well as about 480 adult toads.\n\nMagnetic Island is known as a habitat for koalas and turtles. (Supplied: Lawrence Scheele)\n\n\"Australia's wildlife is so unique and special, and to see it affected by what is essentially an invader of our country is sad,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a lot of them, they eat a lot, and they out-compete most other animals.\"\n\nThe toad busters are hoping to work with Townsville City Council to install bins at the island's parks, so members of the public can leave toads for the 'busters' to collect and destroy, to better protect the island's native species.\n\nThe group uses government funding to purchase plastic traps for tadpoles. (ABC North Qld: Meghan Dansie)\n\nLocal action worthwhile\n\nBusting toads is no small task, with the country infested by more than 200 million of the amphibians.\n\nEnvironmental group Watergum's annual national toad busting event this year saw more than 2,000 people pitch in to remove 199,231 cane toads in 84 locations across Australia.\n\nCars and goods are transported to Magnetic Island via ferry. (ABC North Qld: Meghan Dansie)\n\nProfessor Alford said although eradication was unlikely, localised community efforts to drive down numbers could be effective.\n\n\"On a more local scale, particularly on things like islands, you can trap them, collect them and reduce numbers that way,\" he said.\n\n\"By reducing their numbers you can reduce their impact on all the other animals they affect.\"\n\nMagnetic Island toad busters have laid 30 traps in local creeks. (ABC North Qld: Meghan Dansie)\n\nOn Magnetic Island, Mr Illidge said the toad busters would continue their efforts over the next three years in the hope of ridding the island of the invasive species.\n\n\"We may not eradicate all the toads, but we'll definitely reduce their numbers to a point where they're not making such a big impact,\" he said.\n\n\"It would be nice to see no toads on the island \u2014 that's a dream.\"",

    "text": "E-scooters are more popular than ever across Australia, but Geraldton resident Stuart Wise will never ride one again.\n\nMr Wise was riding a rental e-scooter to his local shops in the regional city about 400 kilometres north of Perth last month when he was struck by a car and seriously injured after he failed to see oncoming traffic.\n\nHe broke his leg in three places and required knee surgery.\n\nHe is urging people not to ride them.\n\n\"Just don't get on them. It's as simple as that. They're dangerous,\" Mr Wise said.\n\n\"You're virtually driving a car with no protection around you.\"\n\nMr Wise says he would not ride an e-scooter again after he broke his leg in three places. (ABC News: Piper Duffy)\n\nLess than three weeks after Mr Wise's accident, another Geraldton man died after falling from a rental scooter on Christmas Eve, becoming the eighth person to die in an e-scooter-related incident in WA in 2025.\n\nThe tragedy has added to pressure on the local council to reconsider its contract with hire company, Beam Mobility, which will be up for renewal at the end of this month.\n\nThe e-scooters have proved popular with both residents and visitors. (ABC News: Bransen Gibson )\n\nCalls for stronger enforcement\n\nPresident of the Champion Bay Surf Life Saving Club, Peter Nelson, said he has witnessed a lot of \"near misses\" between riders and pedestrians on the Geraldton foreshore footpath.\n\nWhile Mr Nelson said he was not against the rental scheme, he said there should be better control measures enforced.\n\n\"If people were more responsible with them, then it wouldn't be such an issue,\" he said.\n\nPeter Nelson says he has witnessed many near misses involving e-scooters along the Geraldton foreshore. (ABC News: Claire Moodie)\n\n\"A lot of the time, it's younger people that are using them, and they don't have the same understanding of what the consequences can be.\"\n\nUnlike privately owned scooters, Beam's e-scooters have \"slow zones\" where speeds are automatically reduced in high-pedestrian areas.\n\nHowever, Mr Nelson wants even lower speed limits along the pathway, especially at peak times, including on Sunday mornings when up to 160 Nippers are running around.\n\nA woman riding an e-scooter in Geraldton without a helmet. (ABC News: Bransen Gibson )\n\nIn June last year, former City of Greater Geraldton councillor Aaron Horsman put a motion for the hireable devices to be suspended until better safety precautions were in place.\n\n\"In the long term I don't think the pros outweigh the cons in regard to safety and whether they can be policed to a safe level,\" he said.\n\n\"Every day at the moment I see people without helmets riding [e-scooters] everywhere, yesterday I saw two double-dinking, no helmets, definitely under the age of 16.\"\n\nMr Horsman says there have been enough warning signs to warrant the council to not renew Beam's contract. (ABC News: Claire Moodie)\n\nWA police said they will always immediately impound e-rideables that are being illegally operated and are collaborating with partner agencies and the state government to deliver state-wide education-focused operations.\n\nMr Horsman said councillors were warned by police that they would not have the resources to monitor the e-scooters before the scheme was approved in 2023.\n\n\"When we made the decision two years ago to vote for this scooter programme, we were given information that there was going to be problems from police,\" he said.\n\n\"Problems with them being able to police them and basically they didn't have the resources.\"\n\nBut unlike the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River, which knocked back a similar hire program due to safety reasons, Geraldton gave Beam the green light.\n\nThere is growing community concern about people riding e-scooters without helmets. (ABC News: Bransen Gibson)\n\nSafety concerns\n\nThe mode of transport has recently been under scrutiny as a parliamentary inquiry into e-rideable safety revealed WA recorded a horror year for e-rideable-related fatalities in 2025.\n\nThe committee noted there were more e-scooter-related deaths in WA in 2025 than the previous three years combined.\n\nThe inquiry found that although limitations in data collection made it difficult to quantify the impact, there were unanimous reports from medical professionals that e-rideable injuries and fatalities were increasing.\n\nFigures from St John WA showed they attended 539 e-scooter incidents in 2024, up from 453 in 2023.\n\nAs of the end of May 2025, they had already attended 328 incidents.\n\nAccessible transport\n\nA Beam Mobility spokesperson said the e-scooters had become a \"valued part of Geraldton's transport mix\".\n\nA Beam Mobility spokesperson says the rental scheme allows people to have better access to places they might not otherwise be able to get to. (ABC News: Bransen Gibson )\n\n\"Since launching in Geraldton in September 2022, Beam's e-scooters have been embraced by the community, with close to 1 million kilometres travelled \u2026 over 99.9 per cent of trips start and end safely without incident,\" they said.\n\n\"They help connect people more easily with public transport and reach destinations they might not otherwise be able to go to.\"\n\nIn a statement, Beam said safety was its top priority, with its e-scooters including automatic speed limits and app reaction tests to deter drink driving.\n\nIt also pointed to its \"Beam Safety ambassadors\" patrolling high-traffic areas and a three-strikes policy where drivers face suspension for poor riding and parking offences.\n\nLocal resident, Lauren Harrington, said she would miss the scooters if they were banned because other public transport options in Geraldton were limited.\n\n\"I think for tourism as well, for people that don't bring cars, want to get around but don't want to walk. It's a really fun thing, \" she said.\n\n\"I would be sad to see them go.\"\n\nLocal member for Geraldton, Kirrilee Warr, said the e-scooters benefited the community when used correctly, but said they were also risky.\n\nKirrilee Warr says the e-scooters work well when used appropriately. (ABC News: Piper Duffy)\n\n\"When used well and appropriately, [e-scooters] do form part of a transport mix for our community to get around,\" she said.\n\n\"There's been a call for increased penalties through that [parliamentary] inquiry, so we're certainly calling on the state government to start implementing those recommendations so we don't see a repeat of what we've seen in 2025.\"",

    "text": "Kyneton Women's Football Club (KWFC) is considering legal action after AFL Victoria blocked its entry in a new league, leaving it \"in limbo\" and nowhere to play in 2026.\n\nThe Kyneton Women's Wedge-Tailed Eagles \u2014 which have said they champion diversity and inclusion \u2014 broke away from Kyneton Football Netball Club (KFNC) in 2024 following claims of disrespect and inequitable treatment. KFNC denies these claims and has maintained it has always been as inclusive as possible.\n\nKyneton was rejected by three competitions to play in 2025, including the Riddell District Football League (RDFNL), where it played as part of the Tigers in 2024.\n\nWhy Kyneton's women's side left their club Kyneton Football and Netball Club's women's team decided to break away from the club in the wake of what players describe as a \"horrible, volatile environment\".\n\nThe Central Victorian Football League (CVFL) then accepted its application with unanimous approval for the 2026 season, but AFL Victoria stepped in after an appeal made by the RDFNL.\n\nThere were many factors considered by the appeal board, including long-term sustainability of the club, participation impact on established pathways at other existing clubs and uncertainty around adequate facilities.\n\nWeeks later, the president of the RDNFL, Brenton Knott, is alleged to have made comments in a leaked message to a supporter that the situation was \"not about footy, it's about grooming and gender weirdness\".\n\nThe message has been reported to the AFL integrity unit by Kyneton, which has called for a review of it. It was alleged to be sent via social media in response to a post on a public forum which was discussing KWFC's application to join the CVFL.\n\n\"You need to look at the other side. They don't deserve anything \u2014 you're advocating that any team that's not happy breaks away,\" the alleged message from Knott, which has been seen by the ABC, read.\n\n\"How is that manageable by the AFL? If you look at the principals (sic) in this \u2014 it's not about footy, it's about grooming and gender weirdness.\n\n\"You follow local footy so you need to see AFL Vic and RDFNL aren't the bad ones here.\"\n\nIn a response statement, KWFC said the club was deeply disturbed by the message, which was now public.\n\n\"Which uses harmful and offensive language in relation to gender diversity and inclusion in football,\" the statement by KWFC read.\n\n\"Inclusion is not a threat to football; it strengthens it.\"\n\nKyneton Women's Football Club is considering legal action after AFL Victoria blocked it from playing in the Central District Football League for the 2026 season. (Supplied: Ties Urie)\n\nKnott, RDNFL and AFL Victoria have all been contacted for comment. The Daily Mail reported Knott to have denied the claims: \"The comments attributed to me shouldn't have been. I am exploring legal advice moving forward.\"\n\nLast year, AFL Victoria did a review of the circumstances that led to KFNC's women's side breaking away to form their own entity, including their claims of a lack of support from the league.\n\nThose findings have not been released, and KWFC has called for the full review to be released to the club and general public.\n\nThe club is now preparing to go to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal to seek a review and overturn AFL Victoria's appeal to not let them play in the CVFL for the 2026 season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kyneton Tigers did not field a women's team in 2025 following the mass women's team departure, but are set to return to the RDNFL in 2026 following the appointment of Lisa Borg as senior coach.\n\nPeta Turnbull, a 24-year-old player for KWFC, said the group has been confused since leaving the Tigers as to why they have found it so hard to be accepted into a league.\n\nKyneton Women's Football Club players don't have a league to play in in 2026. (Supplied: Sophie McLeod)\n\nShe said that while the alleged comments by Knott were hard to read, they gave her some potential reasoning for what was going on.\n\n\"I'm so disgusted (by the alleged comments), but I feel so validated in that there is something deeper, bigger going on. It's not just about, I don't know, us not having a great application, (but) something else is going on behind closed doors,\" Turnbull told ABC Sport.\n\nPlayer and president of KWFC, Natalie Korinfsky, added that the club wanted the RDNFL president's alleged comments investigated by the AFL, as she believed it was evidence of his prejudice, which may have influenced the appeal board, given his position of power.\n\n\"We're deeply concerned that there has been some bias, and if that was the kind of rhetoric that was going around the board at that time, you know, no wonder our applications never got through to the stage where they were successful,\" Korinfsky said.\n\nTurnbull added playing football has helped her socially, mentally and physically and given her life a lot of stability, which has contributed to the application rejections hitting hard.\n\nShe said it feels like the club is being made an example of after speaking out against inequities within long-existing football systems.\n\n\"Every time we get hit back, it's just like another punch to the guts \u2026 it really frustrates me, there's been so much advancement in terms of women and what we can do now and what we have compared to earlier on (especially regarding football participation). (But) it just baffles me how we're still so far ahead yet so far behind too,\" Turnbull said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

(ABC Gippsland: Madeleine Stuchbery )\n\n\"We've had nearly 400 people come out to visit,\" Mr Inchley said.\n\n\"You get down here, and it's like you step back to Gondwana.\"\n\nBut he fears his tree house and its lush surrounds could be at risk, due to auditing errors with a sustainable timber plantation next door.\n\nMr Inchley's property abuts the Hancock Victorian Plantation's (HVP) Fellas Coupe site near Foster in South Gippsland.\n\nHe said he believes the errors mean the company has logged near areas that should have been identified as endangered rainforest, with the flow-on effect potentially damaging wider ecosystems and affecting wildlife corridors on his property.\n\nHVP holds Sustainable Forestry Certification, a voluntary scheme that can be used on any timber-related products from construction timber to tissues and paper.\n\nThe certification aims to balance the logging of native timbers with protecting the areas where they grow, and minimising the damage to the environment.\n\nBut documents point to auditing issues, while academic research suggests timber certification has damaged native forest Australia-wide, sparking calls to reform the sector.\n\nStep back to Gondwana\n\nWhen Mr Inchley's wife Victoria found a rare tree fern in a gully on their property, it proved to be an important environmental discovery.\n\nA subsequent survey found about 130 of the endangered ferns, adding to the limited numbers of the plant statewide.\n\nStuart Inchley is the steward of a patch of temperate rainforest at Turtons Creek, in South Gippsland. (ABC Gippsland: Madeleine Stuchbery )\n\n\"And that was around the same time they started logging next door,\" Mr Inchley said.\n\nHVP is one of Australia's largest private timber plantation companies and is accredited for sustainable forest management by the two independent bodies in Australia responsible for handing out those certifications \u2014 the Forest Stewardship Council and Responsible Wood.\n\nBut a recent assessment by independent body Assurance Services International (ASI), which oversees certification compliance, revealed auditing errors in the Fellas Coupe plantation.\n\nOne major issue was using what ASI says are inappropriate techniques for identifying particularly fragile eco-systems within the wider environment.\n\nThe ASI report found HVP \"did not identify existing rainforest and told ASI that rainforest was not found in several coupes where qualified ecologists, including the ASI technical expert, have identified rainforest as being present\".\n\nMr Inchley said the non-compliance could result in damage to endangered species, such as the slender tree fern, along with wildlife living in the habitat.\n\n\"I would love to see a balanced mosaic of conservation, farming, forestry, all working together with small communities in getting that balance,\" Mr Inchley said.\n\n\"But we haven't got that balance right.\"\n\nChange needed\n\nBut researchers say the entire sustainable forest management certification system needs an overhaul.\n\nIn a recent academic report, Australian National University professor David Lindenmayer wrote Australia's forest biodiversity was at risk from a range of threats, including gaps in protected areas that face industrial logging.\n\nProfessor David Lindenmayer. (Supplied: David Lindenmayer)\n\n\"We found that a large proportion of logging has occurred within optimal areas for the protection of forest and woodland-dependent species of national environmental significance,\" the report said.\n\n\"Our analyses indicate that logging operations are compromising Australia's intention to meet its conservation goals.\n\n\"Our findings highlight the need for urgent reform in Australia's certification schemes and the importance of a significant expansion in protected areas.\"\n\nIndustry response\n\nHVP said audits were used to strengthen \"how we operate to maintain high standards across the estate\".\n\nHowever, the company did not respond to direct questions about how it was addressing the auditing errors.\n\nHVP said threatened species are protected in line with certification bodies, \"and we continue to strengthen our impact assessments, particularly in the Strzelecki Ranges\".\n\nSlender tree ferns at Fellas Coupe in South Gippsland.

    "text": "One of the biggest changes to disability support in a generation is the new Thriving Kids program.\n\nThe scheme, which is expected to start rolling out in mid-2026, is pitched as an alternative to the NDIS for kids with what the government calls \"mild to moderate\" autism or developmental delay.\n\nBut what is a developmental delay, how can you tell if your child has one, and what can you do about it?\n\nWhat is developmental delay?\n\nDevelopmental delay is an umbrella term for when a child doesn't hit milestones at expected age levels.\n\nIt refers to a lag in play and social skills, motor skills, problem-solving skills, self-regulation skills, and communication skills, according to Gehan Roberts, a paediatrician at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne.\n\nGehan Roberts says when children don't reach milestones at the expected age levels this is referred to as a developmental delay. (Supplied: The Royal Children\u2019s Hospital)\n\nHe says communication is the most common area where delays tend to occur.\n\n\"We expect children to have a few single words by their first birthday, or to be combining words into short two-word phrases by their second birthday,\" Dr Roberts says.\n\n\" And when children don't achieve those \u2026 then the term 'developmental delay' is used as a way of flagging that child as somebody who needs some more enhanced monitoring, and potentially, intervention. \"\n\nWhat are the signs?\n\nMelbourne mum Lusia Ford has three sons, including two who are autistic and have developmental disorders.\n\nHer youngest, Fletcher, now 11, was diagnosed with dysgraphia after Ms Ford noticed he was finding it difficult to write his name legibly.\n\n\"It was really evident during COVID because he was homeschooling and I was really noticing that he was struggling to write,\" Ms Ford says.\n\nLuisa Ford's youngest son Fletcher struggled with his writing. (ABC News: Patrick Stone)\n\nThat came after her middle child's diagnosis of dyspraxia (also known as developmental coordination disorder), a neurological condition affecting motor coordination.\n\n\"We were noticing that he was falling over a lot \u2026 and wasn't getting his hands down in time to protect his head or his face,\" Ms Ford says.\n\nWhat should you do if you notice a potential delay?\n\nDr Roberts says a good place to start is the primary care system.\n\n\"Maternal and child health nurses, GPs, both of these workforces are able to respond to parents' concerns \u2026 to try and pin down what areas of the child's development need to be monitored more closely,\" he says.\n\nHe says the decision from there could range from \"watch and wait\", to referring the child to specialists for targeted interventions, or upskilling parents.\n\nThe latter has been big for Ms Ford and her family.\n\nDo you have a story to share? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au\n\nWhile paediatricians, occupational therapists, speech therapists and other specialists have helped her boys see improvements, they've also been crucial in supporting her.\n\n\" Our therapists have really [helped me] understand what I can do when they're not in therapy sessions, what I can do for the other seven days we are at home to really cement some of those new ways of doing things. \"\n\nHow will developmental delay fit into Thriving Kids?\n\nAt the moment, therapies can be accessed through state government-funded community health centres or through private therapists, which many parents pay for using NDIS funds.\n\nHowever, the government says lumping the families of kids with developmental delays with large NDIS packages and being left to work out how to spend it doesn't always lead to the best outcomes.\n\nMinister Mark Butler has also said some children with development delays have been \"overserviced\" by the scheme.\n\nWith Thriving Kids, the government wants to scale up the ability of existing community services \u2014 such as state-run child health services, GPs, and educational settings \u2014 to support families.\n\nThe government is also looking at creating a new Medicare item for bulk-billed three-year-old health checks to pick up any developmental concerns.\n\nWhat could Thriving Kids look like? Despite the government wanting its Thriving Kids program for children with \"mild to moderate\" developmental delay and autism to start next year, the system is yet to be designed.\n\nBut exactly how things will shape up once Thriving Kids begins is unclear \u2014 something causing concern in the disability sector and among families.\n\nWhile there's lots of water left to go under the bridge for Thriving Kids, Dr Roberts says good, evidence-based information sources will continue to be available.\n\n\"We have to remind ourselves that there was a landscape before NDIS and it was around a lot of systems that are still active,\" he says.\n\n\"But the current concern is that the NDIS is seen by many people as \u2026 the only lifeboat in the ocean \u2026 so we're very hopeful that Thriving Kids will change some of the options available for families.\"\n\nCan every developmental delay be 'fixed'?\n\nDr Roberts says the majority of kids with early developmental delays improve with intervention.\n\n\"Fifteen to 20 per cent of kids will experience some form of developmental delay [and] we go into this space with the expectation that if we identify the things that need to be changed and provide the necessary inputs, the child will make progress,\" he says.\n\n\"But for those who don't improve as expected \u2026 thinking about whether they could have an underlying neurodevelopmental disorder, for example, autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability, is important.\"\n\nThe government says kids with \"significant and permanent disability\" will continue to have access to the NDIS.\n\nWhat else should you know?\n\nMs Ford says there are several things she wishes she knew when starting out on her family's journey.\n\n\"Progress looks different for every child. There's probably a lot of mums out there like I was picking up a lot of parenting books, reading websites and listening to podcasts and thinking it was linear. It's not and it's going to be a different journey for every kid and that's okay,\" she says.\n\n\" And milestones are just markers, they're not measures of value. \"\n\nLuisa Ford says both her sons have seen improvements since their diagnoses. (ABC News: Patrick Stone)\n\nDr Roberts says if you feel something isn't right or you don't get the answers you want, trust your gut and seek more information from evidence-based sources.\n\n\"Parents are the experts in their own children,\" he says.\n\n\"It's not about all the hours of therapy or taking the child to all of these different kind of clinicians. It's about parents understanding their child, what are their strengths, what are the areas that need to be developed further and how do we really reinforce the parent or the carer's role in providing that input in everyday interaction.\"",

That's far-fetched now,\" she said.\n\n\" We've got nowhere to go and I feel like I'm at risk of losing everything. \"\n\nMs Torres said she understood the eviction was because she was unable to pay her rent for a period and fell behind, but later paid it back.\n\nMs Torres holds a letter from Foundation Housing. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nThat hasn't changed the decision to evict the trio, and their dogs.\n\nWhat makes Ms Torres\u2019s story interesting is that the decision hasn't been made by a private landlord.\n\nIt was made by a community housing provider \u2014 an organisation which owns and manages the property on behalf of the state government.\n\nThe provider, Foundation Housing, said there was more to the story, but privacy restrictions stopped it from saying what those were.\n\nThousands of properties\n\nMs Torres\u2019s home at Forrestfield \u2014 in Perth's south-east \u2014 is one of around 7,500 community housing properties in WA, which help the government expand its social housing pool.\n\nIn addition to taking government money, community housing providers can use money from superannuation funds and other investors to help build more social housing.\n\nMs Torres was living in one of 7,500 community housing properties in Perth. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nSome also run larger sites \u2014 like apartment buildings \u2014 which can have staff onsite to provide direct, responsive help to tenants to deal with any issues quickly.\n\nWhen the system works well, it can provide support to people who need extra help staying in their homes while they balance other challenges in their lives.\n\nBut there remains concerns about those falling through the cracks.\n\nEviction rate woes\n\nThe vast majority of people in community housing or traditional government-managed public housing have unremarkable experiences and benefit from the safety net those homes provide.\n\nHomeless battle poor sleep, bad diets and stress Western Australian research is showing a strong link between homelessness and poor health, with life expectancy more than 30 years lower for people without secure housing.\n\nHowever, for somewhere around 200 people a year, the relationship between landlord and tenant breaks down and they are evicted following a court order.\n\nWhat concerns some is that the rate of evictions from community housing is around five times higher than from government-run public housing, according to the last two years where data is available.\n\n\"There's been some great initiatives and there are a lot of good people, great people, working in the [community housing] sector,\" Greens housing spokesperson Tim Clifford said.\n\nMr Clifford believes the stakes are high in the sector as housing is fundamental to a person's life. (ABC News: Kenith Png)\n\n\" But there has been concern raised about the eviction rates in the sector, and also the transparency and accountability with the sector. \"\n\nTenancy terminated\n\nMs Torres will tomorrow be added to that tally of evictions from community housing following a court order.\n\nHer home's rent had been set according to her income. But she said it was never adjusted after a period where she couldn't work because of mental ill health and caring responsibilities.\n\nShe said she mentioned those challenges to a Foundation Housing worker who visited her after a difficult period.\n\n\"And then the next thing I heard from Foundation Housing \u2026 my tenancy was being terminated,\" she recalled.\n\nMs Torres says she paid the arrears after the housing provider was granted a court order. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nFrom that point, Ms Torres said she struggled to communicate with the organisation, saying one staff member requested all communications via email.\n\n\"I was just wanting to be able to have a conversation about what was going on and why,\" she said.\n\nThe eviction process continued. Foundation Housing was granted a court order in October to evict the family, after which Ms Torres said she repaid the arrears.\n\nCommunity housing is one of many approaches to Australia's real estate crisis. (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\n\"That was the only time I managed to hear from Foundation Housing,\" she said.\n\n\" They were texting me, calling me, emailing me, wanting to speak with me to return my money in full. \"\n\nWhile Foundation Housing said it was focused on finding ways to sustain tenancies where possible, Ms Torres said that was not her experience, saying she received little support from the organisation.\n\n'Other factors' at play\n\nA Foundation Housing spokesperson said there were \"other contributing factors in addition to rent arrears\" but said it could not say what those problems were.\n\n\"Where an individual tenant's income changes \u2026 the tenant is obliged to advise Foundation Housing,\" they said.\n\nMr Smith says the organisation prioritises early intervention. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nThe organisation's CEO, Chris Smith, told the ABC his organisation \"prioritises early intervention, clear communication, support referrals and reasonable opportunities for tenants to resolve issues\".\n\n\"Foundation Housing made multiple attempts to engage with the tenant, address rent arrears, and explore options to stabilise the tenancy, including opportunities for financial review and support,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHundreds still sleeping rough as WA falls short of ambitious target Social services want the WA government to use its budget surplus to invest in breaking people out of the cycle of homelessness, after it failed to achieve its goal of ending rough sleeping.\n\n\"Unfortunately, despite these efforts, the matter ultimately progressed through the formal court process.\"\n\nAsked why Foundation Housing was evicting Ms Torres despite her repaying her debt, Mr Smith said the organisation was obliged to act in accordance with court decisions.\n\n\"More broadly, Foundation Housing's mission is to provide safe, secure and sustainable housing for people on low incomes and those experiencing vulnerability, while also ensuring the safety of our staff, contractors and the wider community, and the fair allocation of limited social housing resources,\" he said.\n\nQuestion over decision-making process\n\nMr Clifford said the significant difference in eviction rates between public and community housing raised questions about how those decisions were being made.\n\n\"The essential question that should be asked is, is the government doing enough, are they providing enough funding,\" he said, pointing especially to support services provided to tenants.\n\nMr Carey says millions of dollars has been invested to boost housing stock. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nHousing and Works Minister, John Carey, said there had been \"significant investments\" to grow community housing, including $6 million to \"boost the capacity and capability of the sector\".\n\nHe said providers must comply with the National Regulatory Code which requires them to be \"fair, transparent and responsive\" in addition to complying with the law and government policies, with evictions only ever a \"last resort\".\n\nDownsizers hampered by shortage of small homes While many older people say they are keen to downsize their home, the complex reality of doing so leaves many stuck in the family castle.\n\n\"Where concerns arise that a registered [community housing provider] is not adequately supporting tenants or is using eviction prematurely, complaints can be submitted to the Community Housing Registration Office (CHRO) for investigation,\" Mr Carey said.\n\n\"The CHRO can investigate potential breaches \u2026 and issue findings of non-compliance to a registered CHP, along with recommendations.\n\n\"Failure to address recommendations and continued non-compliance could result in escalated enforcement action, including potential deregistration.\"\n\nDecisions magnified\n\nThe CHRO's website says no enforcement action has been taken against any community housing provider.\n\nAnd it's important to point out these issues \u2014 even though more common in the community housing sector \u2014 account for only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of successful tenancies maintained across the state.\n\nDespite the evictions, tens of thousands of tenancies for WA's most vulnerable remain successful. (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\nBut in the midst of a housing crisis pushing more people to the edge and leaving community housing providers with limited options, the effects of each decision are magnified.\n\nThat's especially true for people already battling any number of other challenges, often without the support they need to get through them.",

    "text": "Leg spinner Mitchell Swepson says \"it sucks\" seeing Australian selectors overlook frontline tweakers, urging officials and curators to buck the growing trend of producing pitches that heavily favour seam bowlers.\n\nAustralia is without a specialist spinner at the SCG for the first time in 138 years after Nathan Lyon's injury replacement Todd Murphy was left out of the Ashes series finale.\n\nIt is the fourth time Australia has opted against playing a spinner in their past six Tests.\n\nIn stark contrast, Australia used a spinner in all but one of its 120 Tests between the start of April 2013 and the end of June 2025.\n\n\"I won't be careful \u2014 it sucks,\" said Swepson, who made four Test appearances for Australia in 2022.\n\n\"I'm obviously biased, but I think we've seen it coming in Sheffield Shield cricket.\n\n\"We see less and less spin bowlers coming into the game, particularly in certain parts of the country, and that's what we're now seeing a little bit with the Test arena.\n\n\"We're seeing greener wickets and seam being the main source of wickets, and it's such a shame because there's definitely a spot for spin bowling in Test cricket.\"\n\nSwepson said he suspected cricket officials were more concerned about avoiding pitches that flatten out and produce draws, rather than decks that lead to matches finishing early.\n\nBut that call comes as Cricket Australia (CA) considers stepping in to ensure pitches are produced for Tests to last into days four and five, after losing an estimated $15 million through shortened Ashes contests this summer.\n\nMitch Swepson has played four Tests for Australia. (Getty Images: Jason McCawley)\n\n\"Talking to older guys in Shield cricket \u2026 they talk about batting for two days on an absolute road and then all of sudden chunks are coming out of the wicket,\" Swepson said.\n\n\"I couldn't tell you the last time I played a Shield game like that.\n\n\"It's a real shame and I'd love to see it come back that way, but somewhere in the country has to be prepared to do that and be prepared to make those sort of wickets.\n\n\"I don't know who's going to do that first or whether it's a CA thing or what it is, but it would be great to see that happen again.\"\n\nEngland was 3-211 at stumps on day one at the SCG amid criticism of Australia's decision not to pick a specialist spinner.\n\nAustralia assistant coach Dan Vettori, who played 113 Tests for New Zealand as a spinner, defended the decision to leave Murphy out in Sydney.\n\nVettori said Murphy's omission was based on Australia believing the SCG was a seam-friendly pitch.\n\n\"The bowler [Murphy] that presented in these last two games has been the bowler we first saw in India when he first came on the scene,\" Vettori said after stumps on day one.\n\n\"I think he's ready. He's bowling exceptionally well, once again. It's just tough to see him getting into the game when these conditions tend to suit seam bowling.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Bursting with colour, edged with mountainous cliffs and nestled between Japan and the Korean Peninsula sits a sacred, World Heritage-listed \"forbidden\" island.\n\nOkinoshima island is shrouded in taboos, rich in ancient treasures and boasts thousands of years of history.\n\nIt's also completely off-limits to women.\n\nDeeply rooted in Shinto religious tradition, the 97-hectare island, about 60 kilometres from Munakata city in Kyushu's Fukuoka Prefecture, is one of the few locations in Japan that has been largely untouched since the ninth century.\n\nMen visiting Okinoshima before 2017 were required to purify themselves with sea water. (AFP: Jiji Press)\n\nUntil 2017, only 200 men were permitted to visit the island for a single day each year for its annual On-Site Grand Festival.\n\nThe men had to observe strict religious prohibitions, said Miki Okadera of the secretariat of the Council for the Preservation and Utilisation of the Sacred Island of Okinoshima and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region.\n\nShe said they had to follow purification rituals performed naked in the waters surrounding the island upon landing, abide by the \"Oiwazu-sama\" taboo that forbids disclosing anything seen or heard on the island, and could not remove a single tree, blade of grass, or stone from the island.\n\nProfessor Simon Kaner is a member of the international expert panel that assessed Okinoshima's bid for World Heritage listing in 2017, and is one of only a handful of foreigners invited to visit the island.\n\n\"The island is surrounded by taboos,\" said Professor Kaner, who is the head of archaeology and heritage at the Sainsbury Institute for the Study of Japanese Arts and Cultures.\n\n\" I'm not supposed to tell anybody about what I saw and I wasn't allowed to take anything from the island. \"\n\nOut of respect, many even refrain from uttering the name Okinoshima, instead referring to the \"island whose name cannot be spoken\", the island's committee website states.\n\nThe island is home to a collection of 80,000 votive offerings \u2014 national treasures, or artefacts \u2014 which were deposited there by envoys going back and forth between Japan and the East Asian mainland between the fourth and ninth centuries.\n\nSacred rituals using these offerings were conducted on the island to pray for the protection of the ships and the safety of the sailors.\n\n\"Okinoshima is a microcosm of many of the mysteries which surround Japan's ancient past and a treasure house which casts light on Japan's interactions with the ancient world,\" Professor Kaner said.\n\nA pure gold ring believed to come from the royal tomb in Gyeongju on the Korean Peninsula is one of the tens of thousands of \"national treasures\" extracted from Okinoshima island. (Supplied: Sacred Island of Okinoshima and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region digital archive)\n\nSince 2017, the island has been occupied by a rotation of two dozen Shinto priests from the Munakata Taisha Shinto shrine.\n\nPublic access without permission is a criminal offence.\n\nOnly one priest occupies the island at any given time, working a 10-day roster rotation undertaking rituals and general maintenance.\n\n\"The island remains an object of religious devotion to this day,\" Ms Okadera said.\n\nProfessor Kaner said one of those rituals was intended to venerate the spirits which they believe inhabit the island \u2014 the three female deities [or goddesses] of the Munakata Taisha shrines.\n\nThey believe the spirits have control over the straits between Kyushu and the Korean Peninsula, he said.\n\nA Shinto priest holds a ritual ceremony at the Okitsugu shrine of the Munakata Taisha on Okinoshima island. (AFP: STR/Jiji Press)\n\n\"Whether you believe in those abilities or not, I can say it's a place that has a very special atmosphere,\" he said.\n\nIt is the gender of these spirits, along with other beliefs about menstruation and impure blood, which are responsible for the island's exclusivity.\n\nJapan's gender taboo rooted in religion\n\nOkinoshima's exclusion of women comes from both the Shinto and Buddhist religious traditions, according to Kaori Okano, a professor of Asian studies and Japanese at La Trobe University.\n\nOne of the Shinto beliefs is that the menstrual blood of a woman is \"impure\".\n\n\"Menstruation and childbirth produce a lot of blood, and the blood itself is considered as somehow unclean and impure,\" she said.\n\nA Shinto ritual is held at Munakata Grand Shrine's Okitsumiya on Okinoshima Island. (AFP: Ichiro Ohara Yomiuri/The Yomiuri Shimbun)\n\nBut it wasn't until Buddhism came to Japan in the mid-sixth century that women were banned from Okinoshima completely.\n\n\"Buddhism brought in this more permanent view of women's inferiority and it made this idea [of impure blood] stronger,\" Professor Okano said.\n\nAnother important Shinto belief was that divine spirits \u2014 usually those of a goddess \u2014 reside in natural elements like mountains and seas, and can become \"jealous\" of other women and \"upset\" in their presence.\n\n\"Nature worship believes there is a god in the mountain, a god in the sea \u2026 so there is a god in Okinoshima island,\" Professor Okano said.\n\n\"And if there are female gods there, human beings didn't want to upset the female god by involving women there.\"\n\nOkitsumiya Yohaisho, located on the nearby Oshima Island, is a place where people worship Okinoshima from afar. (Supplied: Sacred Island of Okinoshima and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region digital archive)\n\nOkinoshima is not the only sacred place in Japan to ban women.\n\nGender exclusivity is woven throughout traditional Japanese history, with women banned from many mountains, temples, places of worship and Shinto sacred sites for thousands of years.\n\nThese exclusions continue to have ramifications in contemporary society.\n\nCould Japan's first PM challenge gender beliefs?\n\nJapan this year ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), the lowest among G7 nations.\n\nProfessor Okano said that while Japan scored highly for women's education and health, it ranked poorly in politics, employment and the economy.\n\nJapan may have its first female PM, but some say it is not a win for women In the world of male-dominated politics, Sanae Takaichi has broken through an incredibly tough glass ceiling.\n\n\"In comparison to other first-world countries, the women's status is low, and there's definitely a gender division in terms of family responsibility and employment,\" Professor Okano said.\n\nIn October, the country elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi.\n\nHowever, not long after she took the top job, she was forced to let a male advisor step into the ring to present the Prime Minister's Cup to the winner of an annual sumo tournament due to the sport's longstanding ties to Shinto tradition.\n\nProfessor Okano said she did not believe Ms Takaichi would spend her reign directly challenging gender divisions in the country.\n\nTakahiro Inoue, an advisor to Sanae Takaichi, presented the Prime Minister's Cup at Fukuoka Kokusai Center in Fukuoka. (Reuters: Kyodo)\n\n\"She's a right-wing thinker in terms of defence and economy and she's against the idea of allowing married women to maintain their maiden names. So I don't think she is progressive,\" she said.\n\n\"However, the fact that she, a woman, became prime minister \u2014 you can't become something that you have never seen.\"\n\nNostalgia of tradition and gender discrimination\n\nProfessor Okano questioned whether the World Heritage Committee should have granted Okinoshima its listing while women were still banned.\n\n\"Having Okinoshima as World Heritage in a way legitimatises this gender-specific practice,\" she said.\n\nShe said bans on women visiting many mountains in Japan for the same religious beliefs had been scrapped and people had still been able to continue practising their religion.\n\n\"Even though from a feminist perspective this is a gender discrimination \u2014 kind of systemic exclusion of a woman from visiting some places or participating in certain activities \u2014 some people may see this as a nostalgic tradition,\" she said.\n\n\"And sometimes people \u2014 not everyone \u2014 tend to romanticise tradition.\n\n\"But in order to emphasise nostalgia for the tradition, you don't have to practice it today.\"\n\nOkinoshima is visible from the summit of Mount Mitake on the main island of Kyushu. (Supplied: Imaki Hidekazu, World Heritage Promotion Committee)\n\nShe said the topic was heavily debated when Munakata City was nominating Okinoshima for World Heritage.\n\nProfessor Kaner said the prohibition on women visiting the island had been \"one of the really problematic aspects of the World Heritage inscription\".\n\n\"I would never say that the example of Okinoshima should be used in order to encourage more places to exclude anybody of any gender or any religious bent or anything at all,\" he said.\n\nPreserving Okinoshima's sanctity\n\nA UNESCO spokesperson told the ABC that the island and its surrounding sites were granted World Heritage status on the basis of their Outstanding Universal Value (OUV).\n\nSue ware long-necked jars were also unearthed on Okinoshima from the seventh to eighth century. (Supplied: Sacred Island of Okinoshima and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region digital archive)\n\nAccording to the World Heritage listing, these include the cultural tradition of worshipping a sacred island and important exchanges amongst the different polities in East Asia between the fourth and the ninth centuries.\n\n\"In the island's nomination dossier, the longstanding customs and ritual practices associated with the property were described,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"However, the gender concerns were not raised with regard to its OUV, integrity, authenticity, protection and management.\n\n\"UNESCO does not intervene in the social, cultural, or religious practices that fall within the domestic affairs of its state's parties.\n\n\" Regulations concerning access to sacred sites are addressed within national legal and cultural frameworks and fall under the responsibility of the state party concerned. \"\n\nOkinoshima is not the only World Heritage-listed site with taboos. (AFP: Masanobu Nakatsukasa/The Yomiuri Shimbun)\n\nThe UNESCO spokesperson said there were other World Heritage sites where certain individuals may be prohibited from entering certain areas or participating in rituals, including Mount Athos in Greece, Sacred Mijikenda Kaya Forests in Kenya, Lake Baikal in Russia, and Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in Australia.\n\n\"It is noteworthy that UNESCO continues to promote gender equality as a global priority, while respecting the framework of the World Heritage Convention and cultural diversity,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nProfessor Kaner said the gender exclusion was \"an issue that's recognised by the shrine authorities, and that's why they decided to no longer allow the larger groups of men [who visited annually] to go there anymore\".\n\nCrupper ornaments from the sixth to seventh century, likely from a horse saddle, found on Okinoshima. (Supplied: Sacred Island of Okinoshima and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region digital archive)\n\n\"Many of [these objects that] have now been designated as national treasures have tremendous value for both Japan and for people all around the world in understanding the contribution that Japan has made to world history,\" he said.\n\n\"In the same way that a place like Uluru now has restricted access, these kinds of restrictions \u2014 ideally not gender-based ones \u2014 are one way to not control, but maintain the original state of some of these sites which are perhaps more fragile in nature than others.\"",

In addition to his outstanding tertiary qualifications, written submissions, and references, he was required to undergo an interview process. He was invited to spend a year studying for a Master\u2019s degree and has stayed for two more years to complete a PhD. Oxford University skipper Jack Hamilton, an Australian studying neuroscience. Meanwhile, in between countless hours spent in lecture rooms, Hamilton found time to establish himself in Oxford\u2019s rugby team. This season, the former Newcastle Wanderers junior, who also played for Sydney University, has been honoured with the captaincy. He is the second Novocastrian to lead the Blues, following in the footsteps of Dave Lubans, now a professor at Newcastle University.\n\nAs well as skippering Oxford next month in their annual Varsity clash with Cambridge \u2013 a rivalry that dates back to 1872 \u2013 Hamilton is also at the helm of their first tour of Australia in 30 years. They play Newcastle Uni on January 6 and Sydney Uni on January 9. The latter will be played for the Ian Tucker Challenge Cup, named after a 23-year-old Australian who died while playing for Oxford in 1996. The Oxford University team have been staying at St Andrew\u2019s College on the Sydney University campus. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong Both of their opponents will undoubtedly feature their fair share of highly educated players, but Oxford is on another level. \u201cIn my team, we\u2019ve got five or six guys who are studying at Oxford medical school,\u201d Hamilton explained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got guys doing PhDs in physics, PhDs in cardio-respiratory science, guys that are doing high-level mathematics, poetry, English, biochemistry. \u201cIt\u2019s a real mix. They\u2019re all up-and-coming leaders in their fields, and they all study bloody hard. Oxford University will play two matches on their tour of Australia. \u201cAll of our training sessions are outside of nine to five because the guys are in class all day, every day. We\u2019re in the gym at 6.30am so that everyone can be finished, showered and ready to go for the first lectures at 9am.\u201d Coach and general manager Ian Kench, who played for Oxford in 2008-09, laughed when he said: \u201cCan you imagine coaching them?\n\n\u201cMy first session here, I had to ask them to stop asking questions until the end of the session. \u201cThey\u2019re opinionated, which is good, but it certainly makes it challenging as a coach. They\u2019re good men, but they have curious brains, and they want to know the rationale behind everything. They don\u2019t just do what they\u2019re told, like other teams I\u2019ve coached. \u201cBut it\u2019s good. It\u2019s made me a better coach.\u201d During their tour Down Under, part of Oxford\u2019s mission will be to spread the gospel and roll out the welcome mat. The university has a proud tradition of Australian alumni in its rugby team, including Wallabies Brett Robinson, Joe Roff and, most recently, Tom Robertson.\n\n\u201cThis year I\u2019m the only Aussie in the team, but in my first year we had four or five, including Tom Robertson, who\u2019s obviously played for the Wallabies,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for that niche of players who are capable rugby players, but intelligent and have academic desires to push on because they\u2019re the ones who are going to have good academic transcripts and be eligible. \u201cThere\u2019s a long, long history of Australia players coming to Oxford and playing, and even captaining them. \u201cAustralia is a really important resource for Oxford rugby and has a really strong history. So we\u2019re definitely out here looking to recruit \u2026 we\u2019re trying to get the word out that it is viable and it is an option. \u201cI think a lot of people aren\u2019t aware.\u201d\n\nLoading Hamilton said there were multiple scholarships available for Australians who qualify to study at Oxford. But given the 900-year-old university unashamedly declares only the \u201cbest and brightest\u201d are invited to enter its halls, applicants will be judged on their scholastic CV, rather than their scrummaging technique or sidestepping. \u201cThere are no exceptions,\u201d Kench said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had internationals with 50-plus Test caps to their name apply to get into the university, but we\u2019ve had to tell them that their academic CV is not at the calibre it needs to be.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States has carried out its most direct military intervention in Latin America in nearly four decades; striking Venezuela, capturing President Nicolas Maduro, and declaring it will temporarily run the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sound of explosions)\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin hours of the strikes on Caracas, US President Donald Trump confirmed that Mr Maduro had been captured along with his wife, and said his administration would assume control of Venezuela until a transition could be organised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. And it has to be judicious because that\u2019s what we\u2019re all about. We want peace, liberty and justice for the great people of Venezuela; and that includes many from Venezuela that are now living in the United States and want to go back to their country. It\u2019s their homeland.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also says the US is taking over Venezuela's oil industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go and spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country. And we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe London-based research firm, the Energy Institute says Venezuela holds the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, about 303 billion barrels - that's even more than Saudi Arabia - but much of it is extra-heavy crude that is costly to extract and refine.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Caracas, Venezuela\u2019s remaining leadership condemned the US operation; and is calling on the public to stay calm, accusing the United States of invasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nA national emergency has been declared in Venezuela and the armed forces deployed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWearing a bulletproof vest to deliver a televised address, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello appealed directly to Venezuelans not to panic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From this beautiful place I ask people to stay calm. Trust in our leadership, trust in our military and political leaders during the situation we are facing. Calm, no one should fall into despair, no one should make things easier to our invading enemy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith smoke still rising from military bases around the capital, some Venezuelans say they believe the intervention could finally bring political change after years of crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotorcycle rider Ronald Galuee says many people now see a moment of transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There should be a positive change for all Venezuelans because it has been 28 years of government; and now is the time for transition in this country. Now, we have to wait for these people to speak out and see what they have to say. Everything should happen now and we should get out of this situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut others fear the US intervention will only deepen instability and lead to wider conflict inside Venezuela.\n\n\n\n\n\nFranklin Jimenez, a baker in Caracas, warns that removing Mr Maduro by force could make things worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they took him away, I think they shouldn\u2019t have done so, because this will create an even worse conflict than the one we have now. And as for the bombings and all that, we have to go out, as they said, we all have to go out into the streets to defend our homeland, to defend ourselves.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez later appeared on state television, accusing the US of using force to pursue regime change and seize the country\u2019s resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the strike had been planned under false pretenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had already warned that an aggression was underway under false excuses and false pretexts, that the masks had fallen, and that it had only one objective: regime change in Venezuela. That regime change would also allow for the seizure of our energy resources, our mineral resources, and our natural resources.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last time the US carried out a direct military intervention in Latin America was in 1989 - when then president George W. Bush ordered the invasion to capture then-military ruler, Manuel Noriega, who later faced a trial on charges including drug trafficking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest operation in Venezuela has triggered a wave of global condemnation.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina, Russia and Iran all denounced the US action as a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty, warning it sets a dangerous precedent under international law.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump appeared unconcerned, saying those who oppose the US action will soon be buying oil from US companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In terms of China and Russia. Well, Russia, when we get things straightened out. But in terms of other countries that want oil, we're in the oil business. We're going to sell it to them. We're not going to say we're not. In other words, we'll be selling oil, probably in much larger doses, because they couldn't produce very much because their infrastructure was so bad. So, we will be selling large amounts of oil to other countries, many of whom are using it now. But I would say many more will come.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva says the strikes crossed an unacceptable line.\n\n\n\n\n\nCuba and Colombia are also condemning the intervention, while France is calling for a peaceful and democratic transition, as the UN Secretary-General warns of wider regional instability.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeantime, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is calling on all parties to support dialogue and diplomacy to prevent escalation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Australia has long held concerns about human rights and fundamental freedoms in Venezuela, and will support a peaceful and democratic transition.\n\n\n\n\n\nA statement from Coalition leader Sussan Ley ((Susan Lee)) welcomed news of Mr Maduro's capture, saying the country has endured years of repression and corruption under him.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow with Mr Maduro removed and no clear authority in place, analysts warn the biggest risk may lie ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Cancian of the Center for Strategic and International Studies says the United States may have removed a government without a clear plan for what follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would be quite possible for a new government to exert its authority where the population is - but then be unable to exert that authority in the hinterland. And in the hinterland you have gangs, you have cartels, you have guerillas. So that there\u2019s the possibility of a kind of failed state in the hinterland, even as the government runs the areas that are most populated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are now in New York, where they face US federal charges; including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine trafficking and weapons offences.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charges, filed in New York, accuse the couple of leading a criminal enterprise that enriched senior officials and threatened US security - allegations they have long denied.\n\n\n\n",

The industry accounts for approximately one per cent of global production.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US government has not provided any details on how it will implement its plan yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has said they are going to run the country's natural resources properly and \"the greatest oil companies in the world\" are going to \"invest billions and billions of dollars, and take out money, use that money in Venezuela\".\n\n\n\n\"We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We'll be selling large amounts of oil to other countries, many of whom are using it now, but I would say many more will come.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRaul Sanchez-Urribarri, associate professor of legal studies at La Trobe University, says it's unclear what this will mean in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very hard to see how exactly that will work out \u2014 at least in the short term \u2014 and would definitely need some level of collaboration and constructive engagement with the sitting regime in Venezuela,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Trump says US will 'run' Venezuela and sell its oil after seizing Nicolas Maduro\n\nUS oil giants have not confirmed these comments and Chevron \u2014 the only US oil company still operating in Venezuela \u2014 has said it is focused on the safety and well-being of its employees, as well as the integrity of its assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also other factors that might impact the US plan to control Venezuela's oil \u2014 including China, the leading destination of Venezuela's oil in the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are other players as well in all this saga. We're talking about different countries that have engaged with the oil business in Venezuela,\" Sanchez-Urribarri said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenezuela owes about $10 billion to China and repays loans with crude oil transported in three very large crude oil carriers previously co-owned by Venezuela and China. Last month, Reuters reported that China imports 80 per cent of Venezuela's oil exports.\n\n\n\n'Strong evidence of occupation'\n\nEven if the US effectively gains control of Venezuelan oil, concerns remain about whether such a move will comply with international law.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder international law, when a territory is placed under the authority of a hostile army, it is considered an occupation and it is not related to a specific resource.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Shannon Brincat, lecturer in politics and international relations from the University of the Sunshine Coast, said there is \"no precedent for a state to take control over parts of another, specifically in this case, for one resource for its own use\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Foreign management of oil in this case, after regime change, would be potentially, strong evidence of occupation, which incurs a range of duties on that occupying power,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without the local sovereign's freely-given consent and authority, that would seem to be a hostile occupation.\"\n\n\n\nBrincat said that according to international law, the US \"would have to use that natural resource for the benefit of Venezuela and Venezuela's people\" and \"they could not treat that resource as its own property\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his press conference, Trump said the wealth extracted would go \"to the people of Venezuela\" but also to the US in the form of \"reimbursement\" for the US takeover.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also claimed Venezuela had \"stolen\" the US oil, and that the US built \"the whole industry\" in Venezuela and \"they just took it over like we were nothing\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBrincat said it's difficult to assess Trump's comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a vague suggestion that they had rights to this oil, which I can't see any legal basis for, other than potentially the joint partnership work with Chevron.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, a US court authorised the sale of the Venezuelan oil company Citgo in the US to pay off billions of dollars in debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There might be contracts around that that they could be using, [like] trade rules around to enforce, but to say the US owns it is stretching plausibility,\" Brincat said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, a country's resources are its own.\"\n\n\n\nHow has oil been managed under Maduro?\n\nVenezuela nationalised its oil industry in the 1970s, creating Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), which later opened to foreign investment by establishing ventures with companies such as Chevron, China National Petroleum Corporation, ENI, Total, and Russia's Rosneft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Under Maduro, in particular, how they've managed the oil production is through centralised control under the state companies ... the PDVSA relies on joint ventures with some other companies,\" Brincat said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the company has become politicised under the Chavismo brand, a left-wing populist ideology linked to former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith several investigations, PDVSA has long been accused of corruption.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, a report by a Venezuelan congressional commission said about US$11 billion ($A16.4 billion) of its funds went missing between 2004-14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Venezuelan government has used ... a shadow fleet of tankers, false flagships to transfer oil shipments, often into ... China, Malaysia and other parts of Asia,\" Brincat said.\n\n\n\nWhile Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, its crude output remains at a fraction of capacity due to mismanagement, lack of investment and sanctions, according to official data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We should remember that history shows us that forced regime change does not stabilise oil supply quickly. This is going to be a long-term fix, if anything,\" Brincat said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The instability caused by regime change like this ... And whatever President Trump is trying to set here, sets up a whole range of governance issues as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Reuters\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "If you were able to take time off over the festive season, you're likely not looking forward to having to go back to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the realisation you'll no longer be able to make a spontaneous mid-week trip to the beach or spend your days lounging on the couch, you could also be experiencing the Sunday scaries.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Blue's clinical spokesperson and psychologist, Dr Luke Martin, said that while Sunday scaries isn't a formal diagnosis or technical term, it is \"a common experience of people feeling stressed and anxious about the week ahead\", which typically occurs towards the end of the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I really think about them as a form of anticipatory anxiety about the demands of the upcoming week,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They can involve feelings of worry or dread. There can be physical symptoms, like you might feel a bit panicky, or have headaches, or have problems sleeping.\"\n\n\n\nHow a new year can trigger Sunday scaries\n\nWhile you can experience the Sunday scaries at any time, Martin said they're likely to be \"more magnified\" at the start of a new year , as it's a kind of temporal landmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Temporal landmarks] are these little time periods, whether it's transitioning into a new year, which is the biggest example of it, or transitioning into a new week, Monday morning, Sunday night, where our brain clocks on that there's a bit of uncertainty ahead,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The mind kind of gets really active to try and keep us safe by trying to predict problems and solve them before they occur.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Need a new job? These are the top 10 skills Australian employers are looking for\n\nThe \"stocktake moment\" many of us experience at the start of a new year makes it one of the busiest times for mental health services such as Beyond Blue, Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think once the dust has settled on the festive season and they think about their life and how it's going and where they want it to get better, often that's the point where people seek help \u2014 or at least they think a bit more deeply about their life and what needs to change,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I guess it's a bit of a clean slate and a bit of a fresh start, and you want to kind of set yourself up to have a better year than the last one.\"\n\n\n\nWhat could your Sunday scaries be trying to tell you?\n\nExperiencing Sunday scaries on occasion isn't necessarily something you should be concerned about, Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you've got a big week ahead or you've got a particularly stressful situation that you're facing this week, that's going to be a really normal response to be a bit anxious about it on Sunday night,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if it's happening regularly, it could be a sign that something in your life needs to change.\n\n\n\nWork stress is a common cause of Sunday scaries. Source: Getty / rudi_suardi \"It can be an indicator that the demands you are facing at work are regularly excessive and unsustainable if every Sunday night you're getting worked up about the week ahead,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it can also be a deeper sign that something's not sitting right for you, whether it's within your values or an identity clash between the work you want to be doing and the work that you're required to do that week.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt could also be a symptom of an underlying mental health condition, Martin said.\n\n\n\nTips to overcome your Sunday scaries\n\nThe first step in overcoming your Sunday scaries is working out what's causing them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Deeper reflection on what's driving it will influence how you need to manage it,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is it a stress response that you've had for a long time that you need to work on, or is it a specific problem at work with a project or a colleague you need to address? Is it an ongoing issue with workload you need to talk to your manager about, or is it a sign of a deeper problem with your mental health or with your career and how it's going?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDedicating time each Friday afternoon to sorting out your priorities for the following week can be one way to combat the Sunday scaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Block out the time you need to get your important things done, write anything down that you're worried about that you need to devote time to solving next week,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\n\"That little ritual on Friday afternoon makes it easier for your brain to step back over the weekend. It knows you've got it covered, and it doesn't have to work so hard to look out for you,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisconnecting from work as much as possible over the weekend can also help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you dip into your email or you open a Word document, every time you dip back into that work mode, you're prodding your stress response again,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping your mind engaged in leisure activities all weekend can help prevent the Sunday scaries from taking over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't let your weekend stop at lunchtime on Sunday. Meet up with friends, go out for dinner, or go play tennis or a sport,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't stop worrying about things that haven't happened yet or may not even happen at all, try asking yourself, \"What problems exist right now that I need to solve?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Often the answer is 'there's no problem in this moment', which can be a bit of a circuit breaker to that rumination,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\nFilling your weekends with fun activities can help to stave off anxious thoughts about work. Source: Getty / JulieanneBirch Writing down all the thoughts that pop into your head before you go to bed on Sunday night can help stop your anxiety from derailing your sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Getting it onto paper is another little sign to your brain that you're not going to forget about it. It just lets your brain relax a little bit,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo tackle the physical sensations of anxiety, he suggested trying relaxation strategies such as slow controlled breathing or mindfulness meditation.\n\n\n\nWhat workplaces can do to help\n\nGiven the Sunday scaries are largely driven by work-related stress and anxiety, Martin said it's vital employers minimise \"excessive demands\" put on their staff and foster a \"mentally healthy workplace\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA nationally representative poll commissioned by Beyond Blue in June 2025 found half of the people surveyed had experienced burnout in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that says a lot about the nature of modern work and its ability to wear people down over time,\" Martin said.\n\n\n\nImproving workplace culture can reduce the likelihood that someone will experience Sunday scaries. Source: Getty / MoMo Productions Martin said one way managers can improve staff wellbeing is by having conversations with their direct reports about the nature of the work that they do, asking questions such as: \"What do you like about it?\", \"What's hard about it?\", \"What can we do to make it more manageable?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall changes, such as moving the team meeting on a Monday to a slightly later time, can also make a difference to staff wellbeing, Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even starting it at 9.30 or 10 just gives people a little buffer to transition into that week, which means that their mind doesn't have to work so hard on Sunday night to be ready for 9am Monday,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSigns you may have an anxiety condition\n\nThere are \"three core signs\" that could suggest your Sunday scaries could actually be an anxiety condition that would benefit from professional help, Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first is this anxious thought process where you're imagining the worst-case scenario, or you're fearing the worst-case scenario. This catastrophising is what is really classic in an anxiety condition,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The second area is these physical symptoms, that when you're having these thoughts, you feel worked up and panicky in your body, you're breathing more quickly and shallowly, you can feel sweaty or lightheaded or clammy, or just generally feeling really irritable and tense all the time.\"\n\n\n\nMartin said the third and final sign that your Sunday scaries may be something more serious is that you try to avoid things that trigger \"this distressing anxiety\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are getting out of things at work that are making you feel anxious, if you're overworking as a way of managing your anxiety, if it's really pervasive across your week and it's impacting in your ability to kind of function well each day and it's causing you some distress, all of these are flags that there might be a broader issue here with anxiety that you could seek professional support for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The really good thing is that we have really effective treatments for anxiety conditions that help most people most of the time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information in this article is for general information purposes only and should not be relied on as a substitute for professional medical advice.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo these are tiger nuts. Tiger nuts are not actually nuts, but they get called tiger nuts because they've got little stripes on them that look like tiger stripes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger nuts are in fact a root vegetable, each one the size of a chick pea. The nuts are used to make a plant-based milk, which is gaining popularity worldwide. Laura Hindson was introduced to the nuts by a relative from Mali, and quickly saw a business opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are a great versatile ingredient to make plant-based milk. Tiger nuts themselves are incredibly high in fibre. They're a good source of plant-based iron. They've got lots of vitamins, magnesium and potassium. So, they are quite a nutritious food source.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger Nuts were found in the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs and are a staple food in West Africa. Now, the rest of the world is catching on. Ms Hindson says demand for tiger nut milk is rising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's quite unique, it's very creamy, very smooth, and it's slightly sweet ever so slightly nutty. Last year our business doubled every quarter, which was exciting and challenging at the same time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a purpose-built factory in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, Ms Hindson\u2019s business called Madame Tiger can produce up to 40-thousand litres of tiger nut milk in a single day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we wash then we soak them to soften them and then we mill them with water and then we filter out any fibre that is left in the milk and then we blend it with the other ingredients and bottle it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more to this story.\n\n\n\n\n\nMadame Tiger is changing the lives of more than 600 women and their families in Africa\u2019s Burkina Faso.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Hindson explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we get our tiger nuts from a female farming collective in Burkina Faso called Mousso Faso. And Mousso Faso means land of the wholehearted woman. So, when we first met the collective, they'd been really mistreated and the pay that they were getting per kilo of tiger nuts was really not okay. So, we are paying about three to four times what they were being paid previously for their tiger nuts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBurkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf its almost 14 million inhabitants, only 22 per cent are literate, and life expectancy is below 62 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nFarming tiger nuts is exhausting hard work, mostly carried out by women who are vulnerable to exploitation, according to collective spokesperson Maria Marquez, who\u2019s based in Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the past, and this is not only happening with tiger nuts, but it's an example of what happens with sugar, with coffee, with cocoa, y\u2019know they are not fair systems for that people. So, they have been exposed to scams and to not fair commercial relations, and that has been real pain and a real hurt for those families.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling tiger nuts to Australia for a fair price has helped rebuild trust and improve the lives of the Mousso Faso women, says Ms Marquez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBuilding these stable trade relations helps them to grant their children the opportunity to go to school and to improve infrastructures and their daily lives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut secure income is not the only concern for these women.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurkina Faso has become a terror hotspot.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, it topped the Institute for Economics and Peace Global Terrorism Index.\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder and Executive Chairman Steve Killelea explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2024, there was 1,532 deaths. That's about 25 per cent of all deaths globally. Successive weak governments through Africa, combined with a whole lot of tension between different tribal groups and ethnic groups within the Sahel, and that's been compounded by international Jihadists moving into the area now and starting to become active.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Government organisations or NGOs try to help Burkina Faso villagers tackle poverty and rising terrorism.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Marquez volunteers with an NGO called CIM Burkina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is y\u2019know an increasing violence on the country with armed groups that are attacking and there are lots of civilians dying, that has been increasing. So, the situation on the country overall is very, very hard. And this project and this relationship with Madam Tiger has been helping them to have a fair income for, to improve their lives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor her part, Melbourne-based entrepreneur Laura Hindson is incredibly proud to be building a small business that helps the women of Burkina Faso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey've done things like building shelters, sorting shelters so that they're not as exposed to the sun. They've built wells and better facilities for washing the tiger nuts. They've been able to build a warehouse and pipelines as well. So, it has made a really big impact on the women and the farmers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global milk alternatives market is expected to reach 150-billion dollars by 2035.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian market is already worth more than $600 million annually - and is growing quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs local demand increases, Madame Tiger needs ever more tiger nuts, as Ms Hindson explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe bought six tonnes of tiger nuts in 2020. In the next year we did seven tonnes, then 15 tonnes, then 30 tonnes, and then last year's harvest was 60 tonnes. So they're 10 times what the volume was in 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger nut milk may be on a roll, but growing this business hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Hindson says the support of family and friends was vital.\n\n\n\n",

I often liken it to photography which wasn\u2019t recognised as a legitimate art form for quite some time until it started to enter into museums and then into auction houses et cetera. I think we can see a similar, somewhat sped up trajectory for AI as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sale, titled Augmented Intelligence amassed over 1.1 million dollars, despite six of the artworks not selling.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also accumulated over 6,500 signatures by artists calling to cancel the auction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an open letter to the gallery, the letter said, \u201cif you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction. Yours sincerely, the undersigned artists.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Sue Beyer, the distinction isn\u2019t so clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a multi-disciplinary artist, she says developments in AI simultaneously fascinate and repel her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m using a lot of different new media and also AI. The AI, I really enjoy using because it\u2019s not perfect and I like its weaknesses. I\u2019m sort of treating like an oracle or not God, but I give the AI an instruction, or prompt and it gives me information in return. It\u2019s like a collaborative process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Beyer is even using the technology to learn more about herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019ve been using it is not really offensive or scary. Nothing like Black Mirror [[dystopian television series]] or The Terminator [[sci-fi movie]] or anything like that. I\u2019m asking questions like \u2018Who am I?\u2019 and \u2018Who is Sue Beyer?\u2019. I\u2019m sort of using irony because I\u2019m looking at what it means to be human using something that obviously isn\u2019t human.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Brisbane Portrait Prize announced it was changing its entry guidelines stating, \u201cit is impractical to have a blanket ban on the use of AI.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, it allowed entrants to submit artworks completely generated using image creation platforms like Midjourney or DALL-E.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving criticism by parts of the artistic community, organisers reconsidered its entry requirements to only allow works partly generated using AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, Dennis McCart\u2019s self-portrait using reprocessed AI images took home $10,000 for the Digital Award.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirrunga Wiradyuri, a Wiradjuri man and Founder of Birrunga Gallery won the competition's Packer Prize in 2021 for his portrait titled Night Rainbow.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis First Nations gallery boycotted the prize last year for its guidelines on AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he will not be entering the award again this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was really unfortunate, because I know there are some very reasonable people within that organisation. I just can\u2019t say I\u2019ve got a great deal of respect for the decisions made. It would have been very easy to go, \u2018Oh, ok. We hadn\u2019t considered that. It doesn\u2019t even have to be considered a real good point, just a reasonable point. Why don\u2019t time out on this?\u2019. Everyone would have gone \u2018Great decision, the Brisbane Portrait Prize listens to Blackfellas.\u2019 Instead, what we\u2019ve got is we\u2019re pressing on regardless because we\u2019ve got experts who say its harmless. I don\u2019t get it, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri believes it\u2019s not the change he opposed to.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, he says he\u2019s in favour of controversy and challenging messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not about censoring, I\u2019m not about that at all. I just feel as though at a minimum you should not do harm and at the moment, I can see this doing harm. So, there\u2019s this reckless notion that it\u2019s ok to harvest and reproduce First Nations artwork. The ramifications for that are next level cultural appropriation, cultural theft, it\u2019s colonisation, it\u2019s disenfranchisement, it\u2019s diminishing, it\u2019s diluting, it\u2019s invisible-ing us again, another level of invisible-ing us. I mean, that all adds up to false representation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri says cultural appropriation and stereotypical perceptions of First Nations art is a reality he still confronts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of his galleries Cultural Creative Development Program, he provides professional exposure for emerging Aboriginal and Torres Strait artists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means creating artworks for businesses' Reconciliation Action Plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri says he still gets asked for traditional dot painting art.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a style derived from the Central and Western Desert regions of Australia - but not Wiradjuri in New South Wales, where he is from.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Louise Buckingham is the CEO of Arts Law Centre Australia, which provides specialised legal support to First Nations creators through its Artists in the Black service.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says with the rise of AI, cultural flattening and fake Indigenous art is rife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware of how important the Indigenous art market is and also how extensive the market for fake souvenirs and fake art has been alongside of that and the damage it does to our existing art market. You know, one set of stakeholders is benefiting to a greater extent than ever in the context and history of the technology boom and one group is losing out to a greater extent than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Stock, a graphics software that provides royalty free photos and graphics, has faced scrutiny by the National Indigenous Times for its representations of First Nations art and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nA search of \u2018Indigenous Australian\u2019 brings up images of people with generic body markings or wearing Native American feather headdresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople wearing business suits on the platform are quote \u201crepresenting workplace diversity\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nA search for \u2018Indigenous Australian art\u2019 surfaces images of didgeridoos and boomerangs, AI rock and dot style paintings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extended licence for each of these AI images costs nearly 90 dollars on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Australia\u2019s current legislation, copyright for artistic works generally last the lifetime of the creator plus 70 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Buckingham says while this may seem like an extensive period, for First Nations communities whose art and culture moves across past, present and future, it can raise issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of AI-generated art, it gets more complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, copyright law does not subsist or exist for artificial intelligence, as legally, there is considered to be no human authorship or originality to protect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also means that concerns over how AI models are being trained using artists' works are difficult to legislate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe responses to things like the Christie\u2019s auction which received a lot more in sales than people anticipated, but it also elicited a response from creators who were outraged that the notion of an auction for this kind of artwork. You know, there have been other responses from all around the world from creators of all descriptions and when we are talking about visual art, and we have class action complaints in the US that we will be watching very closely here in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA working group on Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property was established in December last year, to protect First Nations knowledge amidst the rise of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Buckingham says consultation from the working group has already been paused until after the federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, The University of Chicago has developed tools like Nightshade or Glaze, which are being used by artists to fight back against AI data scraping.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tools transform data from images into \u201cpoison\u201d, so that AI training on them without consent learn unpredictable behaviours.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this software, the university says a prompt that asks for an image of a cow flying in space might instead get an image of a handbag in space.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Pfefferkorn from the Art, AI and Digital Ethics centre believes while AI is new, artists have been balancing the relationship between ethics, technology and science for centuries.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming jobs at a pace not seen since the rise of the internet, stirring anxiety across Australia's workforce about who will be replaced \u2014 and who might benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the past three decades, the internet has reshaped the way Australians work. Before that, offices transitioned from typewriters to computers, and earlier still came the transformative arrival of electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery technological leap brought unease, and the rapid rise of AI is now prompting a fresh wave of concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News spoke to cyber and workforce experts about why AI is generating so much caution \u2014 and what potential it could unlock for Australian workers.\n\n\n\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence\n\nUntil a few years ago, AI was a concept that few people had extensive knowledge of beyond what the 1984 film Terminator had presented.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Could AI in classrooms stop children falling behind at school?\n\nHowever, since the launch of ChatGPT (GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) in late 2022, AI has suddenly become a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\nChatbots now appear routinely on websites, search engines are increasingly driven by AI, and tasks once completed manually are being automated.\n\n\n\n\n\nLess than two years ago, the idea of an Australian company hiring an \"AI prompter\" seemed novel. Today, it is common.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Tuffley, a senior lecturer in applied ethics and cybersecurity at Griffith University, explained that when we talk about AI in the workforce, \"we are talking about large language models like ChatGPT\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a bunch of them, and they are basically really clever prediction engines, they just basically deduce what it is you want them or tell them to do,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence enables the automation of standard business processes that have previously been performed manually. Source: Getty / NurPhoto Tuffley said businesses had started automating standard operating processes that had previously been done manually, using agentic AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is using AI as an agent to do things, involves the cobbling together, a bit like Lego, of individual components of AI so that you get a workflow happening, and it's clever enough to make expert judgement depending on circumstances,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSo, which workers could be impacted by AI?\n\nExperts say the impact of AI on jobs is complex, with both potential disruptions and opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research from the Australian HR Institute (AHRI) paints a nuanced picture. According to the research, entry-level roles in the Australian workforce have increased in the short term due to AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nAHRI CEO Sarah McCann-Bartlett said the institute's latest Australian Work Outlook for the December 2025 quarter found four in 10 organisations (41 per cent) reported an increase in entry-level roles due to AI, compared with just 19 per cent reporting a decline.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said this trend aligns with Jobs and Skills Australia's recent Generative AI Capacity Study and a Technology Council of Australia report, both of which indicate AI is more likely to augment jobs than replace them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The survey data suggest that the future trajectory of the Australian jobs market is nuanced and uncertain,\" McCann-Bartlett said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Need a new job? These are the top 10 skills Australian employers are looking for\n\nProfessor Greg Bamber from Monash University's Business School and the Monash AI Institute shared a different view, stating \"clerical, entry-level, and administrative roles\" are among the jobs most exposed to AI and automation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffley also noted that as more routine business processes are automated, he expects \"grassroots level employees, junior employees, will probably be made redundant\" as AI becomes more widespread.\n\n\n\n\n\nJanine Dixon, director of the Centre for Policy Studies at Victoria University, said Jobs and Skills Australia estimated 55 per cent of workplace tasks could be performed by people using AI, with another 15 per cent of tasks that could be entirely replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centre used these figures in modelling work to explore what the future Australian economy might look like.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe outlined two broad possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we can do a whole lot of things without using human input, that means we can have a whole lot more things; it means that we have economic growth and growth in incomes,\" Dixon told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The other thing is if there's a whole lot of things that can be done without humans, then there aren't jobs for humans in those areas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modelling suggests this could lead to a temporary rise in unemployment, although much depends on \"the speed of adoption of AI, which is quite unknown\".\n\n\n\n\n\nDixon also noted the modelling assumed the government would take a passive approach to how AI is adopted.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Kathryn lost her banking job to a chatbot. She just confronted her CBA bosses\n\nIdentifying job losses caused directly by AI is challenging, experts say. But one high-profile case emerged in July, when 45 Commonwealth Bank customer service employees were made redundant due to the impact of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat decision, however, was reversed after the Finance Sector Union took the matter to the Fair Work Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs and Skills Australia's report listed five occupation types most likely to experience job losses due to AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese were general clerks, receptionists, accounting clerks and bookkeepers, sales, marketing and public relations professionals, as well as business and systems analysts, and programmers.\n\n\n\nJobs and Skills Australia's report listed five occupation types most likely to experience job losses due to AI. Source: SBS News In terms of industries that may lose the most jobs, the report highlighted retail trade, public administration and safety, financial and insurance services, professional, scientific and technical, and rental, hiring, and real estate.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Tuffley said the real risk may lie with workers who don't adapt to using AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The kind of Luddites who just refuse to engage with the technology, they won't lose their jobs immediately, but over time they'll become less and less useful employees,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTurning AI into opportunity\n\nDixon said potential job losses could open doors in industries desperate for workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The release of those humans from those jobs that underpins a whole lot of income growth in the sense of having more people available to do other things, you get this sort of redistribution of jobs away from the jobs where there's a lot of automation potential for AI and into jobs where there isn't,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the modelling suggested \"potential expansions in areas such as a lot of the trades, a lot of the caring occupations, those hands-on and face-to-face occupations\".\n\n\n\nThe Jobs and Skills Australia report forecast employment growth in the construction industry, as well as accommodation and food services, manufacturing, education and training, and agriculture, forestry and fishing. Source: SBS News The Jobs and Skills Australia report forecast employment growth in the construction industry, as well as accommodation and food services, manufacturing, education and training, and agriculture, forestry and fishing.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoles such as cleaners and laundry workers, midwives and nurses, business administration managers, construction and mining labourers, and hospitality workers were listed as those that would \"gain the most employment\".\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffley said workers who would adopt AI tools and utilise them to enhance their productivity would become more valuable to employers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It basically leverages their output sometimes, by, you know, 10 times,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To put it bluntly, it is going to make people redundant, but it is going to make existing businesses more efficient and therefore more profitable.\"\n\n\n\nTuffley said the \"hype around agentic AI exceeds the ability of most organisations to take full advantage of it\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They know it exists, and they'd like to be using it to good effect, but they're not quite sure how to do it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jobs and Skills Australia report urged the government to take the lead in steering the transition to a Gen AI-enabled labour market and to enhance AI capability across the entire population.\n\n\n\nUnions warn AI could threaten workers\n\nAs AI threatens to replace jobs across industries, the federal government has released its long-awaited National AI Plan, describing it as \"a whole-of-government framework that ensures technology works for people, not the other way around\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan aims to create an inclusive AI economy that protects workers, fills service gaps, and supports local AI development.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a significant shift, it confirms Australia will not introduce mandatory guardrails for high-risk AI, instead relying on existing laws and minor adjustments where needed, supported by a new $30 million AI Safety Institute within the Department of Industry.\n\n\n\nThe Jobs and Skills Australia report urged the federal government to take the lead in steering the transition to a Gen AI-enabled labour market. Source: NurPhoto / NurPhoto via Getty Images Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary Joseph Mitchell welcomed parts of the plan but warned workers remain wary of AI's impact on jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Workers aren't afraid of AI but are rightly sceptical about letting it go unchecked, especially when the technology has already been used by big business to undermine wages, conditions, and to wipe out jobs,\" he said in a media release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Workers are tired of being told by large tech companies that AI will bring improvements in the far distant future, when our rights and our jobs are under threat right now,\" Mitchell said.\n\n\n\nThe AI era: Jobs we can't yet imagine\n\nBamber said the rapid pace of AI development means roles that feel secure today could face new pressures in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tasks previously considered impossible for AI might become possible as hardware, sensors, robotics, etc are improved,\" Bamber said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffley said predicting the impact of AI on workplaces is tricky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't know exactly what these new industries are going to look like, but what we do know is that in the history of technology, every new step forward like this, like the industrial revolution, which created a lot of new jobs that only 10 years earlier, no-one could have predicted what they would be,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"AI is a lot like electricity was 100 or so years ago. Electricity made possible all sorts of things. It was an enabling technology,\" Tuffley said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People realised that you could create an electric refrigerator or an electric water pump, or an electric whatever, and it created a whole new set of industries creating electrical appliances, devices driven by electricity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said change had created a lot of wealth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So what I am sure will see is, in the coming decade or more, we'll see AI being used to create whole new categories of products that don't exist yet and I can't really say what they'll be, because that'll be the brainchild of some clever entrepreneur,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhat workers can do to prepare\n\nKai Riemer, a professor of information technology and organisation at the University of Sydney, suggested workers learn and experiment with AI to get the most out of it.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Government announces long-awaited national plan for artificial intelligence\n\n\"Upskill yourself with free videos online or a microcredential, and experiment with different AI tools,\" Riemer told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nRiemer said some people made the mistake of using AI chatbots as if they were Google.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't use AI chatbots like a search engine, they're not. Instead, try reversing roles, have the AI ask you questions, give you feedback on your work,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said people could get the most out of AI by using it to \"build your skills, ask for explanations, not answers, and make sure you don't outsource your thinking\".\n\n\n\n",

This season, the former Newcastle Wanderers junior, who also played for Sydney University, has been honoured with the captaincy. He is the second Novocastrian to lead the Blues, following in the footsteps of Dave Lubans, now a professor at Newcastle University.\n\nAs well as skippering Oxford next month in their annual Varsity clash with Cambridge \u2013 a rivalry that dates back to 1872 \u2013 Hamilton is also at the helm of their first tour of Australia in 30 years. They play Newcastle Uni on January 6 and Sydney Uni on January 9.

Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong Both of their opponents will undoubtedly feature their fair share of highly educated players, but Oxford is on another level. \u201cIn my team, we\u2019ve got five or six guys who are studying at Oxford medical school,\u201d Hamilton explained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got guys doing PhDs in physics, PhDs in cardio-respiratory science, guys that are doing high-level mathematics, poetry, English, biochemistry. \u201cIt\u2019s a real mix. They\u2019re all up-and-coming leaders in their fields, and they all study bloody hard. Oxford University will play two matches on their tour of Australia. \u201cAll of our training sessions are outside of nine to five because the guys are in class all day, every day. We\u2019re in the gym at 6.30am so that everyone can be finished, showered and ready to go for the first lectures at 9am.\u201d Coach and general manager Ian Kench, who played for Oxford in 2008-09, laughed when he said: \u201cCan you imagine coaching them?\n\n\u201cMy first session here, I had to ask them to stop asking questions until the end of the session. \u201cThey\u2019re opinionated, which is good, but it certainly makes it challenging as a coach. They\u2019re good men, but they have curious brains, and they want to know the rationale behind everything. They don\u2019t just do what they\u2019re told, like other teams I\u2019ve coached. \u201cBut it\u2019s good. It\u2019s made me a better coach.\u201d During their tour Down Under, part of Oxford\u2019s mission will be to spread the gospel and roll out the welcome mat. The university has a proud tradition of Australian alumni in its rugby team, including Wallabies Brett Robinson, Joe Roff and, most recently, Tom Robertson.\n\n\u201cThis year I\u2019m the only Aussie in the team, but in my first year we had four or five, including Tom Robertson, who\u2019s obviously played for the Wallabies,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for that niche of players who are capable rugby players, but intelligent and have academic desires to push on because they\u2019re the ones who are going to have good academic transcripts and be eligible. \u201cThere\u2019s a long, long history of Australia players coming to Oxford and playing, and even captaining them. \u201cAustralia is a really important resource for Oxford rugby and has a really strong history. So we\u2019re definitely out here looking to recruit \u2026 we\u2019re trying to get the word out that it is viable and it is an option. \u201cI think a lot of people aren\u2019t aware.\u201d\n\nLoading Hamilton said there were multiple scholarships available for Australians who qualify to study at Oxford. But given the 900-year-old university unashamedly declares only the \u201cbest and brightest\u201d are invited to enter its halls, applicants will be judged on their scholastic CV, rather than their scrummaging technique or sidestepping. \u201cThere are no exceptions,\u201d Kench said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had internationals with 50-plus Test caps to their name apply to get into the university, but we\u2019ve had to tell them that their academic CV is not at the calibre it needs to be.",

    "text": "The owner of a rural roadhouse has made a desperate plea to Aussie drivers and tourists after a young couple's nightmare ordeal in the outback.\n\nJulie Condon, who runs Greenvale Roadhouse with her children, told Yahoo News Australia that a couple turned up to her business after following directions from a map app, which led them to a petrol station that didn't exist.\n\nThe two young Aussies, who were driving from Cairns to Townsville, were forced to trek for two hours to the main road and then hitchhike to the nearest roadhouse, in Greenvale, in the Charters Towers region of Queensland, to collect fuel.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGetting led astray by map apps like Google Maps is an all too common problem happening in rural parts of Australia, prompting her plea to drivers to double and triple check before blindly following online maps, saying this type of thing \"happens all the time\".\n\nShe called on local communities and authorities to be more \"diligent\" about the issue.\n\n\"It's a big problem to solve, but in smaller communities, we could put out road closed signs on dirt roads,\" she told Yahoo News.\n\n\"People aren\u2019t ignorant; they won\u2019t go down them if there is a road closed sign,\" she said.\n\nJulie runs the Greenvale Roadhouse with husband Dan. Source: Facebook/Greenvale Roadhouse/Pony Express\n\nHow did the young couple get stuck?\n\nJulie, who took over the roadhouse with her husband Dan in 2024, explained that the young couple had flown into Cairns from a holiday in New Zealand before making their way to Townsville in the car.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen they realised they were running low on fuel, they plugged in the nearest 24-hour petrol station that came up on their map app and set off, hoping they'd make it in time.\n\nBut the map led them down a no-through road to a town that once had a fuel bowser years ago, which no longer existed.\n\nAfter realising they were going the wrong way, they turned around and got bogged.\n\n\"Their fuel was too low, so they walked for two hours to the main road,\" she said.\n\nThey then hitchhiked their way to Julie's roadhouse to collect jerry cans to cart petrol back to the car.\n\nJulie and her family, who did not catch the young couple's names, kindly helped them back to their car with enough fuel to get them back to the roadhouse to fill up properly.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile the couple offered to give Julie cash for her kind act, she refused.\n\n\"I've got three daughters and a son, I'd hope anyone would do that for them too,\" she said.\n\nJulie's advice to drivers on long rural road trips\n\nJulie advised travellers to \"always ask for local knowledge\".\n\n\"The most important thing is not to go off the bitumen. Stay on the tarmac,\" she said.\n\nShe added that calling ahead or sending a message on Facebook to petrol stations to double-check they exist and have fuel is a good way to avoid incidents like the young couple endured.\n\n\"Always have food and water,\" she said.\n\nWhile the young couple managed to get out of the sticky situation, others aren't as lucky, and Julie warns that type of incident can \"quickly escalate\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"It can quickly turn pear-shaped,\" she said.\n\nPolice warning after man and granddaughter break down\n\nAir crews were sent to rescue a man and his granddaughter who were stranded in the outback for days. Source: NT Police\n\nLast week, a man and his granddaughter had to be rescued after getting into engine trouble.\n\nNorthern Territory Police issued a reminder to travellers after the pair spent three days stranded when their car broke down 100km from the Queensland border.\n\nTo alert air crews of their location, they made an SOS signal in the dirt.\n\nActing Senior Sergeant Chris Harden praised the efforts of the pair, and highlighted the importance of being prepared when making long road trips in remote areas.\n\n\u201cThe pair did everything right and were well-prepared for their journey, travelling with all the appropriate equipment,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"As a result, they were able to handle an unforeseeable circumstance and safely waited in place until police arrived to assist.\n\n\"Make sure you carry plenty of food and water, read the NT Road reports and carry a means of remote area communication, such as a phone with satellite communication capabilities,\u201d he said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
