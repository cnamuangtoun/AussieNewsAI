    "text": "Macquarie Investment Management Ltd (MIML) has today undertaken to repay thousands of people who invested hundreds of millions of dollars from their retirement savings in the collapsed Shield Master Fund (Shield).\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) began proceedings in the Federal Court against MIML, a subsidiary of the Macquarie investment bank, following admissions that it did not act efficiently, honestly and fairly by failing to place Shield on a watch list for heightened monitoring.\n\nThe corporate watchdog also accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from MIML to ensure Macquarie pays to members 100 per cent of the amounts they invested in Shield less any amounts withdrawn.\ufeff\n\nMacquarie Investment Management Ltd is a subsidiary of Macquarie Group. (Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\nUnder the terms of the enforceable undertaking, Macquarie must pay the funds to affected customers by September 30.\ufeff\n\nASIC said, as superannuation trustee, Macquarie Investment Management Ltd oversaw about $321 million in super investments into Shield by about 3000 of its members between 2022 and 2023.\n\nASIC deputy chair Sarah Court said the watchdog's investigation will see Macquarie return these members to the position they were in before their retirement savings were dwindled.\n\n\"This is an important outcome that stems the significant losses that threatened thousands of members' retirement savings after they used Macquarie's platform to invest their super in Shield,\" she said.\n\n\"Many members thought their funds were safe when they used Macquarie's super platform to invest in Shield, which had no track record.\"\n\nThe payments will be made in full by next Tuesday.\n\nASIC deputy chair Sarah Court. (Photo: Alex Ellinghausen) (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nUnder the agreement, ASIC is not seeking civil penalties against MIML, despite admitting it breached the law.\n\nThe corporate watchdog said this was in recognition of the level of cooperation demonstrated by Macquarie in agreeing to pay members 100 per cent of the amounts invested in Shield less any amounts withdrawn, without waiting for an outcome of the Shield liquidation or proceedings against other parties involved.\ufeff\n\nMacquarie Group said its decision \"to devote resources to achieve this outcome recognises Shield's unique circumstances, notably the scale of the issue, its material impact on many investors and their limited access to recourse from the many different entities which played a role\".\n\n\"The approach of providing immediate certainty and an improved outcome for investors benefits all parties,\" the bank said.",

    "text": "Optus' Singaporean owner will fly to Australia next week in the wake of the under-fire telco's second major triple-zero outage in two years.\n\nYesterday, Optus chief executive Stephen Rue \ufeffadmitted the brand had \"absolutely\" suffered reputational damage after a failure to follow step one of an upgrade process caused a 13-hour technical issue that affected about 631 emergency calls and was linked to three deaths last week.\n\nThe team involved that day was comprised of both Optus and third-party Nokia staff in Australia and India, and despite five people calling the customer service line advising that there was an issue affecting triple-zero calls, the matter was never escalated.\n\nOptus' Singaporean owner Singtel Group will fly to Australia next week. (LinkedIn)\n\nParent company, Singtel Group,\ufeff will visit Australia next week to discuss the incident with Optus.\n\nSingtel Group is \ufeffa Singapore-based telco conglomerate backed by Temasek Holdings, an investment firm fully owned by the Singapore government and managed by Finance Minister and Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells is hoping to meet with representatives of Singtel.\n\n\"I have asked to speak to Singtel when they are in the country next week,\" she told ABC this morning.\n\n\"This remains a constant watch for me, and whilst we have to let the investigation play out, and we have to be considered in a government response to the results of this investigation, meeting with Singtel, I think, is an important step.\" \ufeff\n\nSingtel Group chief executive Kuan Moon Yuen made his first statement about the triple-zero outage yesterday, almost a week after the technical error occurred.\n\nThe triple-zero outage has called into question Optus' operating licence. (Dominic Lorrimer)\n\nIn it, he said he was \"deeply sorry\". \ufeff\n\n\"We are deeply sorry to learn about the network incident at our Optus subsidiary that has impacted Triple Zero calls, and to hear that customers could not connect to emergency services when they most needed them,\" he said.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have passed away, and we know that Optus will get to the bottom of this matter.\n\n\"We are working with the Optus board and management to ensure a thorough investigation of this incident to prevent any future recurrence.\"\ufeff\n\nThe triple-zero outage has called into question Optus' operating licence due to its second major failure to comply with emergency call service regulations and other related rules in two years.\n\nThese are the same rules the telco breached in 2023 when a nationwide triple-zero outage affected more than 2000 customers.\n\nOptus CEO Stephen Rue updates the media on the company's response the triple-zero outage. (Sitthixay Ditthavong)\n\nOptus was fined $12 million, but failed to implement a third of the recommendations from a review into that outage.\n\nOptus Board Chairman John Arthur said the board was working with Rue, who was hired in November to turn the brand around after his predecessor stepped down following fallout from the first outage, to prevent any further repetition of this incident.\n\n\"What has occurred is clearly unacceptable, and on behalf of the board, I apologise for this failure in our accountability to all those who relied on our triple-zero services,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAn independent review is underway to determine what happened, Optus' management of triple zero calls and its adherence to policies, procedures and legal requirements.\n\nThe report is expected to be completed before the end of the year. \ufeff\n\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority is also investigating, and Wells has hinted there may be a wider review \ufeffinto the telco industry and emergency service network.",

(LaPresse via AP)\n\nNo casualties were reported but there was damage to the vessels and \u201cwidespread obstruction in communications,\u201d it added.\n\nActivists posted a brief video showing what appeared to be an explosion on or near one of the vessels. Greece\u2019s coast guard did not report any distress calls.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions regarding the attack.\n\nThe flotilla, which organisers say includes about 50 vessels and participants from dozens of countries, is carrying a symbolic amount of humanitarian aid, including food and medicine, for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry has accused organisers of being linked to Hamas, an accusation organisers reject.\n\nIsrael has proposed that the activists unload their aid in the Israeli port of Ashkelon for it to be transported into Gaza, saying it will not accept any breach of its blockade.\n\nDefiant activists\n\nThunberg called the strikes a \u201cscare tactic\" that wasn't going to stop the flotilla.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing isn\u2019t that we were hit by drones,\" Thunberg said on a livestream, adding that the focus should remain on Gaza. \"Drones are something that Palestinians experience 24-7.\"\n\nItalian activist Simone Zambrin said drones \u201chave been flying over our heads for days now\u201d and on Wednesday \"dropped devices at our boats, damaging both the sails and the hearing of some of our crew members.\u201d\n\nShe said Israel was trying \"to instill fear because it is afraid of our arrival.\u201d\n\nSwedish climate activist Greta Thunberg waves from a boat taking part in a civilian flotilla bound for Gaza, aiming to break the Israeli blockade and deliver humanitarian aid, in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025 (AP)\n\nGreg Stoker, an American activist on one of the boats, said online that the vessel's radio communications suffered interference, with the jammers playing an ABBA song over the radio channel the flotilla was using.\n\nItaly and Spain sending navy patrol vessels\n\nItaly condemned the attack and activated a navy frigate to be on hand for possible rescue operations, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said.\n\nCrosetto said the frigate Fasan was heading to the area from its position north of Crete \"for possible rescue operations.\u201d Italy has informed Israel about the decision.\n\n\u201cIn a democracy, demonstrations and forms of protest must also be protected when they are carried out in accordance with international law and without resorting to violence,\u201d Crosetto said.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said Spain also will send a patrol vessel to assist the flotilla, or carry out a rescue.\n\n\u201cThe Spanish Government demands that international law be complied with and that the right of our citizens to navigate the Mediterranean safely be respected,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said Monday in New York.\n\nItaly\u2019s Foreign Ministry meanwhile said its computer systems had been overwhelmed by a \u201cmail bombing\u201d campaign in which thousands of what it said were fake emails flooded its servers after the attack on the flotilla.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Global Sumud Flotilla had sent out an urgent appeal to its supporters asking them to email the ministry demanding it take a firm position to condemn the attack on the flotilla and put diplomatic pressure on those responsible.\n\nThe emails \u201chad the effect of hindering the work\u201d of the ministry's crisis unit, which has been the main point of contact for Italian citizens aboard the flotilla, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Italian officials have said 58 Italians were in the flotilla, including some lawmakers.\n\nThe European Union also warned against the use of any force. \u201cThe freedom of navigation under international law must be upheld,\" said Eva Hrncirova, a European Commission spokesperson.\n\nUN Human Rights Office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan called for an investigation.\n\nAttacks on the flotilla\n\nThe flotilla has reported several attacks since it set sail from Spain on September 1, including two while some of its boats were in Tunisian waters.\n\nActivists say it's the largest attempt to date to break the Israeli maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has now lasted 18 years, long predating the current war in Gaza. Israel says the blockade is needed to keep Hamas from importing arms, while critics consider it collective punishment.\n\nThe almost two-year war has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants, but says around half were women and children.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading authority on hunger crises said last month that Israel\u2019s blockade and ongoing offensive had already pushed Gaza City into famine. More than 300,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks as Israel has ordered the population to move south, but an estimated 700,000 remain, according to UN agencies and aid groups.\n\nThe war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 others hostage. Israel says its operation in Gaza is aimed at pressuring Hamas to surrender and return the remaining 48 hostages, about 20 of whom Israel believes are still alive. Most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.\n\nActivists have launched several flotillas aimed at breaking the blockade over the years, nearly all of them intercepted by Israel. Another vessel said it was attacked by drones in May in international waters off Malta.\n\nAn overland convoy traveling across North Africa also attempted to reach the border but was blocked by security forces aligned with Egypt in eastern Libya.",

(Supplied)\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\n\"I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience for asking to breastfeed my six-month-old during breaks or in class,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"The balancing act between professional responsibilities and motherhood is challenging enough without social pressures and stigma adding to the burden.\"\n\nWhen she was told by organisers she'd miss too much of the course if she fed her son outside for longer than 10 minutes, Ryan was asked to come back another time or split the course over two days.\n\n\ufeff\"I'm extremely disappointed that you are making this so difficult for new mums who run businesses,\" Ryan told the trainers via email.\n\nIn response, the course managers said they could not \"guarantee there won't be a disruption to the class\".\n\nAs a personal trainer, Ryan needed to attend the eight-hour class to fulfil her business requirements.\n\n\"It's really upset me\u2026 I run a business, I am not just doing this to be away from my baby for fun,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't know why they made it such a drama.\"\n\nRyan did not want to name the CPR course for this article.\ufeff\n\nShe later found a shorter first aid course with organisers who said she could bring her baby and feed him if needed.\ufeff\n\nRyan \ufeffsaid Dr Elise Turner's experience being booted out of a Virgin business airport lounge in Melbourne last week for expressing milk reminded her of how she was treated as a new mum.\n\n\"I instantly felt disgusted, furious, upset and disappointed that in 2025 breastfeeding and pumping mothers are still made to feel a sense of shame, guilt and embarrassment,\" she said.\n\nRyan dropped out of the first aid course after being told she couldn't breastfeed.

(Getty)\n\nWhat is 'RaptureTok'\ufeff?\n\nA surprising number of TikTok users, most of them from the US, have posted videos claiming that the rapture will occur on September 23 and 24.\n\nSeveral TikTok users who have made \ufeffvideos about the supposedly impending rapture have detailed how they're preparing to leave the Earth for heaven.\ufeff\n\n\"When you finally start moving up into the air, I recommend that you don't hold on to anything \u2026 keep your face looking upwards,\" one user said.\n\nOne user shared a clip of a car being put on a tow truck and claiming they sold their car because they wouldn't need it after the rapture.\ufeff\n\nAnother claimed she stocked her home with canned food and left 'instructions'\ufeff for the people who will be left behind on Earth after the rapture.\n\nSome \ufeffhave even spoken about how they're preparing their children for the rapture.\n\nSeveral TikTok users have made \ufeffvideos about how they're preparing to leave the Earth for heaven.\ufeff (Getty)\n\nThe movement, dubbed \"RaptureTok\" by some users, has sparked confusion and \ufeffridicule on social media.\n\nBut the more non-believers interact with \ufeff\"RaptureTok\" content, even if only to poke fun at it, the more the TikTok algorithm pushes similar content to users.\n\nHence why \"RaptureTok\" appears to be all over everyone's feeds right now.\n\nWhy do people think the rapture will happen this week?\n\nThe theory that the rapture will occur on \ufeffSeptember 23 and 24 appears to have originated with a South African man named Joshua Mhlakela.\n\nMhlakela holds no religious titles but claimed to have previously worked as a pastor.\n\nIn June, YouTube user\ufeff CettwinzTV posted an interview with Mhlakela where he claimed to have had a vision of Christ telling him the rapture was coming.\n\n\"He says to me: 'On [September] 23 and 24, 2025, I will come to take my Church,'\" Mhlakela said in the clip.\n\n\"The rapture is upon us, whether you are ready or not.\"\n\nThe video has since been viewed more than half a million times.\ufeff\n\nThis is the YouTube video where Joshua Mhlakela claimed the world would end on September 23 and 24. (YouTube/@centtwinz)\n\nWhat is the rapture according to the Bible?\n\nThough the rapture is a staple in some Christian belief systems, the word 'rapture' does not actually appear in the Bible.\n\nSeveral passages in the New Testament reference the second coming of Christ, the end of the world, or other events that believers may link to the Rapture.\n\nOne such reference is Thessalonians 4:13\u201317, which reads: \"For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.\n\n\"After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord Forever.\"\ufeff\n\nThe word 'rapture' does not actually appear in the Bible, but there are references to the end times. (Getty)\n\nThe book of Revelation also details specific signs that will precede the end of the world in chapters five, six and eight.\n\nIt starts with seven 'seals'; a white horse, a red horse, a black horse, \ufeffa pale horse, martyred souls, natural disasters, and silence in heaven.\n\nFollowing the breaking of the seven seals, angels will sound seven trumpets\ufeff of judgement, signalling the end of days.\n\nBelief in the rapture specifically\ufeff can be traced back to mid-19th century Britain.\n\nChristians already believed in the second coming of Christ but this new belief suggested that only \ufeffsome people - especially virtuous Christians, usually - would be accepted into Heaven.\n\nThe theory gained traction in the 20th century and was picked up by \ufeffevangelical media, later spreading into pop culture as well.",

    "text": "Anthony Albanese has used a speech at the United Nations to recommit Australia to the fight against climate change, a day after Donald Trump told the world body it was a \"con job\" that was destroying the West.\n\nThe prime minister also urged world leaders to seize the \"moment of opportunity\" to work towards peace in the Middle East \u2014 but he did not mention Israel by name, nor refer to a UN commission of inquiry's recent finding it was carrying out a genocide.\n\nAnd he confirmed Australia would push for a temporary seat on the UN Security Council, a project started by the previous Coalition government but rarely mentioned since Labor's return to power.\n\n\"The United Nations is much more than an arena for the great powers to veto each other's ambitions,\" Mr Albanese told the General Assembly in New York.\n\n\"This is a platform for middle powers and small nations to voice \u2014 and achieve \u2014 our aspirations.\n\n\" That is why Australia is seeking a place on the UN Security Council in 2029-30. \"\n\nThe speech was Mr Albanese's first at the UN's headquarters, where Foreign Minister Penny Wong has addressed the room in past years.\n\nThe prime minister earlier spoke at two sideline events on climate, outlining his government's new 2035 emissions reduction target and arguing Australia's embrace of clean energy would make it achievable.\n\n'Your countries are going to hell': Trump's complaint-filled speech to the UN Photo shows Donald Trump speaks in front of green marble. Donald Trump uses a speech at the UN to criticise US allies' moves to recognise Palestine and chastise the international community over a range of other American grievances.\n\n\"Australia is acting to meet the environmental challenge of climate change while working to seize and share the economic opportunities of renewable energy,\" Mr Albanese told the General Assembly.\n\n\"Clean energy can carry the world beyond the false choice between economic growth and environmental responsibility.\"\n\nMr Trump, who posed for a selfie with Mr Albanese at a function the night before, had earlier used his UN speech to trash the world's efforts to fight climate change and tell Western leaders it was one reason their \"countries are going to hell\".\n\nBut Mr Albanese said clean energy \"enables the rapidly growing economies of the Indo-Pacific to industrialise and decarbonise at the same time, and to continue lifting their people's living standards while lowering their nation's emissions\".\n\nReviving a decade-old goal\n\nMr Albanese's 19-minute address put a focus on the UN's founding values of global cooperation, and mounted an argument for strengthening the 80-year-old institution in the face of growing threats.\n\nAfter Mr Trump questioned the purpose of the UN and accused it of leaving global peacemaking up to him, Mr Albanese said the body should reform, but: \"If the United Nations steps back, we all lose ground.\n\n\" If we give people reason to doubt the value of co-operation, then the risk of conflict becoming the default option grows. \"\n\nThe world faced \"all manner\" of challenges, including cruel dictators, invading tyrants, oppressive regimes and \"autocracies deploying new technology to undermine our trust in democracy, institutions and each other\".\n\nHe effectively revived a decade-old goal in saying Australia would seek a temporary place on the UN Security Council.\n\nThe decision to seek a seat for the 2029-30 year was announced by then-foreign minister Julie Bishop in 2015.\n\nAt the time, Labor criticised the \"unambitious\" time frame, which Ms Bishop said was appropriate for such a competitive process. \"We don't want to spend unnecessary time and resources trying to campaign at an earlier slot,\" she said.\n\nElections are set for June 2028.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Albanese said, Australia would also do its part by investing in defence, development and diplomacy and strengthening the security of the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe speech was Anthony Albanese's first at the UN. (Reuters: Eduardo Munoz)\n\n\"We are deepening our engagement with ASEAN, and elevating our partnerships with Indonesia, India, the Republic of Korea and Japan,\" he said.\n\n\"And we are breaking new ground with old friends: in the United Kingdom, the European Union and our principal ally, the United States.\"\n\nSeeking peace\n\nJust hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned the UN the \"most destructive arms race in human history\" was underway, Mr Albanese reiterated Australia's support for Ukraine \"against Russia's illegal and immoral invasion\".\n\n\"We share the resolve of every member of the 'coalition of the willing' to secure peace on Ukraine's terms,\" he said.\n\nAnd on the Middle East, he repeated calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and the flow of aid.\n\n\"For decades, leaders have come to this podium in search of new words and new ways to call the world to action on a two-state solution.\"\n\nExperts hope UN report on genocide spurs action Photo shows A crowd of Palestinians walk along a dusty road with their children, a man in front is carrying a baby wrapped in blankets. What ultimately determines whether the UN's report joins the list of other shocking but overlooked inquiries is whether this latest finding moves any governments, including Australia's, to take further action.\n\nAfter quoting the UN Charter's peace-oriented vision, he said: \"We must ask ourselves: When can those words hold meaning, if not now?\n\n\"Where can those words apply, if they do not apply to the Middle East? And what can we, the members of the United Nations, say we stand for if we cannot say we stand for this?\"\n\nHe said Hamas must have no role in Gaza's future, but he did not use the word \"Israel\" during his speech.\n\nIsrael has reacted angrily to the official recognition of Palestinian statehood, made by Australia and other Western nations in recent days, calling it a reward for Hamas. Mr Trump made the same criticism in his speech.\n\nIran's 'criminal acts of cowardice'\n\nMr Albanese also used the speech to take a swipe at the Iranian regime over its alleged antisemitic plots in Australia, which he called \"criminal acts of cowardice, aimed at spreading fear\".\n\n\"If ever we had the luxury of imagining that breaches of international law were not our concern, or that conflict and turmoil in another part of the world could not affect us, those days are long gone,\" he said.\n\n'Ambitious' United Nations of the 1990s is no more Photo shows Donald and Melania walking on the tarmac at the airport The United Nations has been powerless to do anything about the escalating horrors being seen to be inflicted on the Palestinian people in Gaza.\n\n\"Just last month, Australian security agencies confirmed that the Iranian regime orchestrated the firebombing of a synagogue in Melbourne and a Jewish restaurant in Sydney,\" he told the general assembly.\n\n\"We expelled the Iranian Ambassador from Australia, the first time since the Second World War that our country has taken such a step.\n\n\"And here at the United Nations, we repeat to the world: there is no place for antisemitism.\"\n\nSenator Wong, Energy Minister Chris Bowen and Communications Minister Anika Wells were part of the Australian delegation in attendance.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Albanese attended a forum to promote Australia's social media age limit to international leaders and delegates.",

    "text": "In the late 90s, Yorta Yorta/Gunaikurnai playwright and director Andrea James performed at Melbourne Festival as part of an Aboriginal clown troupe.\n\nTheir name was the Oogadee Boogadees, and they sprang from Melbourne Workers Theatre, founded by playwright Patricia Cornelius in the late 80s.\n\n\"We didn't really know what we were doing,\" James says.\n\nShe recalls seeing in the audience the late Uncle Bob Maza, an actor, playwright, activist and co-founder of National Black Theatre.\n\n\"He really supported us,\" she says.\n\nMaza is the father of Yidinji, Meriam and Dutch director Rachael Maza, the outgoing leader of Ilbijerri, Australia's oldest Indigenous theatre company.\n\nJames, now an award-winning playwright, was announced on Thursday as Maza's successor at Ilbijerri Theatre Company, as she steps back after almost 18 years as artistic director.\n\nListen to Rachael Maza on ABC Radio National's Speaking Out Photo shows Rachael Maza\n\n\"It's just so lovely to continue to be a bit in that Maza orbit, with Rachael's encouragement and the colleagueship that we've shared over the years, too,\" James says.\n\n\"The way she's built the company up from a project-to-project, community-led company to a major performing arts organisation is just extraordinary.\"\n\nIn a statement, Maza described James as having a \"sharp contemporary voice rooted in identity, creative sovereignty and truth-telling\".\n\n\" Andrea's extraordinary talent as a writer, director and producer will honour Ilbijerri's legacy of bringing bold and impactful Blak stories to the national and international stage. \"\n\nTheatre that shaped her\n\nWhen James graduated from the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) in 1996, Ilbijerri was a nascent theatre company, formed by a collective of Indigenous artists just five years earlier.\n\nNew play re-examines problematic past Photo shows A stage set of a motel room; an Indigenous woman sits on the bed; a painting of a ship hangs on the wall Andrea James's powerful new play shows just how much work Australia still has to do to reckon with the past.\n\n\"There were such incredible people that were volunteering their time,\" James recalls. \"[They were] artists and community members who were really passionate about having an Aboriginal theatre company.\"\n\nThose artists included writer and activist Bev Murray, actor Kylie Belling, theatre maker John Harding, late artist Destiny Deacon and more.\n\nWithin a few years of graduating from VCA, James worked on the development of what would become one of Ilbijerri's most enduring works: Jane Harrison's play about the Stolen Generations, Stolen, which premiered in 1998.\n\n\"The Naarm community and the artists there, they really encouraged me, but they also challenged me a lot, too,\" James says.\n\nWithin the next decade, she was invited to collaborate with Ilbijerri as a co-writer on Coranderrk: We Will Show the Country, which opened in Melbourne in 2010.\n\nThe late Uncle Jack Charles starred as Wurundjeri Elder and artist William Barak in Ilbijerri's Coranderrk: We Will Show the Country in 2013. (Supplied: Belvoir/Patrick Boland)\n\nThe play was composed of the testimony of men and women who lived on the Coranderrk Aboriginal Reserve and campaigned for land rights and self-determination at an 1881 government inquiry.\n\nLast year saw the premiere of Ilbijerri's Big Name, No Blankets, written by James, about the Warumpi Band, which in the 80s became the first rock band to sing in Aboriginal languages.\n\nBig Name, No Blankets debuted at Sydney Festival in January 2024, before touring to Rising, Darwin Festival and Brisbane Festival. (Supplied: Sydney Festival/Brett Boardman)\n\nBetween those shows, James's career in theatre has seen her take on the role of artistic director of Melbourne Workers Theatre in the 00s, and most recently associate artistic director at Griffin Theatre Company in Sydney.\n\nShe's also written a slew of plays, including Sunshine Super Girl, about Australia's first Aboriginal world tennis champion, Evonne Goolagong, and this year's The Black Woman of Gippsland.\n\nWhile James plans to keep writing plays while running Ilbijerri, she says she will also offer space to other Indigenous theatre makers \"for them to tell their stories, with their communities and their clan groups\".\n\nJames with tennis player Evonne Goolagong, the inspiration for her play Sunshine Super Girl. (Supplied: Griffin/Jhuny-Boy Borja)\n\nThat's space in terms of ambition \u2014 she wants to see large-scale works from established writers \u2014 and physically; she hopes to establish a dedicated studio space for Ilbijerri in Melbourne to develop work and potentially even perform for audiences.\n\n\"If we want to have more First Nations set designers and costume designers, then we need space for that,\" she says.\n\n\"I really look forward to a day where people come to our space and it's a Blackfella space. It's Blak-led and completely Blak-informed [and] we feel safe and good in the foyer, or, if it's outside, around a fire, whatever that might be.\"\n\nA vital company for today\n\nJames intends to maintain the culturally embedded, community-minded spirit of Ilbijerri, while at the same time enhancing its reputation as a national theatre company.\n\n\"It's going to be a good opportunity to ask the sector in Naarm and around: 'What is it that we've been doing well? Where are the gaps? How can I build on the opportunities that have come [before]?'\" she says.\n\nAs artistic director, James plans to \"listen deeply and respond accordingly\".\n\n\"All you've got to do is open up your heart and mind and do stuff with cultural respect and integrity and listen really carefully to people and the stories they want to tell,\" she says.\n\nShe initially applied for the role at the behest of other members of the theatre community.\n\n\"We get called to these jobs,\" she explains. \"Our community demands it of us.\"\n\nIt's a responsibility James takes seriously, considering the scarcity of opportunities for Indigenous theatre makers in Australia.\n\n\"They're massive jobs,\" she says. \"The Blackfella performing arts sector is immense and diverse, and people really care about this company.\"\n\nJames during rehearsals for Melbourne Theatre Company's production of her play The Black Woman of Gippsland. (Supplied: Jacinta Keefe)\n\nShe says Ilbijerri also feels vital in the wake of recent attacks on Indigenous peoples in Australia, including one on Camp Sovereignty after an anti-immigration rally earlier this month.\n\nSeven men have been charged with the attack.\n\n\"There are groups of people in our society who want us to shrink; that don't want us to do Welcomes to Country; that don't want us to hold our cultural, rightful place in this country,\" James says.\n\nIn the face of that prejudice, she points to Ilbijerri's stated aims, which include working with allies to eradicate racism in Australia.\n\n\"That's not to say that we're making theatre so that we can educate whitefellas, because we don't; we're making our theatre for ourselves and for our mobs,\" James says.\n\n\"But if we can bring our allies and accomplices along the way, who can work with us to counter these extremely racist and dangerous views in our country, that's one of the key things organisations like Ilbijerri can do.\n\n\"The more we can come together to continue to create culture that we invite people into, the more people are going to respect and understand and appreciate the absolute beauty and spirit of this country.\"",

(ABC News: Alice Walker)\n\nThe 28-year-old Albury man lives with autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability \u2014 and supports almost every AFL team.\n\n\"Fifteen AFL men's teams,\" Mr Cozens confirmed.\n\nHe is known to wear merchandise from multiple clubs at once, and dreams of visiting every AFL football ground.\n\nMs Cronin realised that passion could be a window to a new social network: an AFL fan club.\n\nJacob Cozens (right) and his stepfather John Cronin are keen football fans. (Supplied: Karen Cronin)\n\n\"Growing up with Jacob, we often didn't get the invitations to the parties,\" she said.\n\n\" He didn't have friendships outside of his disability support network \u2014 I needed to do something. \"\n\nAn inclusive party\n\nMs Cronin approached her son's disability support service employer for permission to use an existing venue designed for people with disabilities, and started getting the word out about a new club.\n\nThe idea was to create a relaxed, supervised space where people with disabilities could socialise without explicitly working towards goals in their NDIS plans.\n\nThere is no obligation to RSVP, and numbers vary for each AFL Fan Club gathering. (ABC News: Alice Walker)\n\n\"We started off with three people, we didn't know how it was going to go,\" Ms Cronin said.\n\n\" Within five minutes there was high-fiving, the guys were getting together, they watched football, they were smiling. \"\n\nFrom that first gathering seven years ago, the AFL Fan Club has grown to attract as many as 50 people.\n\nKaren Cronin plans to register the AFL Fan Club as a charity. (ABC News: Alice Walker)\n\nLearning skills\n\nAccording to the 2021 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, people with disability are twice as likely to experience social isolation.\n\nWatch the new season of The Assembly on ABC iview Photo shows A young person holding a microphone standing amongst audience. Leigh Sales returns to mentor a new cohort of autistic journalism students from across the country as they interview some of Australia's favourite celebrities.\n\nMr Cozens meets most days with support workers, who assist him with social challenges and work towards independent living.\n\nRespect Support Services co-director Adrian Hoffmann said Mr Cozens could become overwhelmed in the community.\n\n\"He doesn't always know how to interact with some people,\" Mr Hoffmann said.\n\n\"We encourage him to interact with members of the public, with cashiers to select food from menus \u2026 he's come a long way.\"\n\nAdrian Hoffmann has been working with Jacob Cozens for about five years. (ABC News: Alice Walker)\n\nMr Cozens's love of AFL is well known by his support team.\n\n\"It's off the charts,\" Mr Hoffmann said.\n\n\"Jacob would be at the footy every weekend if he could.\"\n\nSkills in practice\n\nThere are no memberships for the fan club, just an open invitation to get together every few weeks and enjoy the football and company.\n\nErin Wojtkowski supports Collingwood and enjoys travelling to the football each year. (ABC News: Alice Walker)\n\n\"It gives me a chance to hang out with my friend Jacob,\" regular participant Erina Wotjkowski said.\n\n\"I like talking to everyone,\" club member Mark Inwood said.\n\nMark Inwood is an Essendon fan who enjoys socialising at the AFL Fan Club. (ABC News: Alice Walker)\n\nMs Cronin said the group had worked wonders for her son and his interactions with others.\n\n\"His life has blossomed through this club, it's been amazing,\" she said.\n\n\" And not only his \u2014 many of the other participants as well feel connected to something and feel that they're welcomed. \"\n\nThe AFL Fan Club often meets at service provider Mercy Connect's Lavington social hub. (Supplied: Karen Cronin)\n\nMr Cozens supports both Geelong and Brisbane \u2014 so whatever happens in this weekend's grand final, he will be a winner.\n\nHe is equally supportive of the social group.\n\n\"I like the AFL Fan Club,\" he said.",

Her debut album I Love My Computer is vying in major categories like Album of the Year, Best Solo Artist, Best Independent and Electronic Release.\n\nA two-time triple j Unearthed High finalist, Nina Wilson has been making music since she was 12 years old.

    "text": "Nottingham Forest's long-awaited return to European competition ended in a 2-2 Europa League draw at Real Betis, with Igor Jesus's first-half double cancelled out by a late Antony strike.\n\nForest's return to a major European competition for the first time since March 1996 began on the wrong foot, with Betis taking the lead inside 15 minutes when Cedric Bakambu fired an effort high into the net.\n\nThe two-time European Cup winners responded swiftly as Jesus levelled from close range within two minutes and then headed in again in the 23rd minute.\n\nBoth sides pushed for a breakthrough following the interval. Betis gradually seized more control as the match wore on and were finally rewarded five minutes from time, when Antony tucked away Marc Roca's cross to ensure the spoils were shared.\n\nWith the result, Forest boss Ange Postecoglou became the club's first permanent manager since Billy Walker in 1946 to go without a win in his opening four matches.\n\n\"I think first I should be proud of the players' efforts. It's a difficult place to come, difficult conditions, people don't realise the humidity out there,\" Ange Postecoglou said to TNT Sports.\n\n\"I'm just disappointed that the players and supporters don't get the rewards for our efforts. I've just got to make sure they keep their heads up because there's plenty to be positive about and the wins will come.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nPostecoglou guided Tottenham Hotspur to claim the Europa League title last season, the London-based club's first trophy in 17 years, and first continental trophy in over four decades.\n\nBut a poor English Premier League campaign, where Spurs finished a lowly 17th, led to the Australian being sacked at the end of the season.\n\nPostecoglou was named Forest's manager earlier this month.\n\nPrevious manager Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, who had led the club back to qualifying for European football, had started the season with a win, loss and draw.\n\nSince Postecoglou took over, Forest was beaten by Arsenal 3-0 and drew 1-1 with Burnley in the EPL.\n\nForest also blew a two-goal lead in the second half to be knocked out of the League Cup by Championship side Swansea.\n\nForest's next match will be at its home ground on Sunday, AEST, against Sunderland in the EPL.\n\nReuters/ABC",

(ABC Great Southern: Kate Forrester)\n\n\"I've got the most precious cargo on board and my job is to get them safely from A to B, but I have this ongoing saga of livestock continuously on the road, creating a real, present danger,\" Mr McGrath said.\n\nAbout half of the bus run is on gravel back roads, where Mr McGrath said he saw sheep and cows on an \"almost daily basis\".\n\nDanny McGrath says the livestock are big enough to cause a lot of damage if hit.

    "text": "Macquarie Investment Management has committed to repaying thousands of Australians who invested hundreds of millions of their retirement savings in the collapsed Shield Master Fund (Shield) amid admissions it contravened the Corporations Act.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against Macquarie Investment Management after the subsidiary of Macquarie Group admitted that it did not act efficiently, honestly and fairly by failing to place Shield on a watch list for heightened monitoring.\n\nThe corporate regulator also accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from Macquarie Investment Management to ensure it pays members 100 per cent of the amounts they invested in Shield, less any amounts withdrawn.\n\nDeep flaws in Australia's $4.3 trillion system exposed Photo shows A woman wipes away tears as she tells her story. The collapses of the First Guardian and Shield schemes have exposed deep flaws in the regulation of Australia's $4.3 trillion superannuation sector.\n\nASIC said, as superannuation trustee, Macquarie Investment Management Ltd oversaw approximately $321 million in super investments into Shield by about 3,000 of its members between 2022 and 2023.\n\nThose customers will now be fully compensated for any losses by Macquarie, while the investment bank will be forced to wait until the liquidation of the Shield fund to recover some of those funds.\n\n\"This is an important outcome that stems the significant losses that threatened thousands of members' retirement savings after they used Macquarie's platform to invest their super in Shield,\" said ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court.\n\n\"Many members thought their funds were safe when they used Macquarie's super platform to invest in Shield, which had no track record.\n\n\" ASIC's investigation will see Macquarie return these members to the position they were in before their retirement savings were eroded. \"\n\nThe investment banking giant said in a statement that affected investors will receive the funds before the end of this month.\n\n\"Macquarie's decision to devote resources to achieve this outcome recognises Shield's unique circumstances, notably the scale of the issue, its material impact on many investors and their limited access to recourse from the many different entities which played a role,\" the company noted.\n\n\"The approach of providing immediate certainty and an improved outcome for investors benefits all parties.\n\n\"To enact the payments, Macquarie will purchase the investors' holdings in Shield at the current fair value, which is based on the estimated ultimate recovery from the liquidation process. In addition, Macquarie will make a goodwill payment to investors, with the two payments equating to 100 per cent of the net capital each client originally invested in Shield.\"\n\nAs part of the deal, ASIC is not seeking penalties against Macquarie Investment Management, despite admissions it breached the Corporations Act.\n\nThe regulator said this is in recognition of Macquarie's cooperation, its willingness to fully compensate its affected members and to speed up the compensation of those whose retirement savings have been frozen as a result of the Shield collapse.\n\nWhile the 3,000 investors in Shield who accessed the fund through Macquarie's superannuation platform are now poised to get their money back, there's roughly 1,800 other investors who aren't covered by this deal.\n\nMost of them invested in Shield through Equity Trustees, which is also being sued in the Federal Court by ASIC for its role as a super platform host for the collapsed fund.\n\nIt is estimated that about $160 million was invested in Shield through the Equity Trustees super platform.\n\nThen there are roughly 6,000 people who invested funds in First Guardian, a separate fund that collapsed around the same time as Shield. They are believed to be around half a billion dollars out of pocket.",

It even set debt collectors onto some of its own customers.\n\n\"This is not what we expect from any Australian company, let alone a provider of essential services,\" Ms Lowe told me.\n\n\"Some of the cases and what happened to people in this matter makes for truly sobering and truly awful reading.\"\n\nThe fine against Optus was finalised, as it received widespread condemnation this week over its fatal triple -0 outage. Ms Lowe wouldn't comment on this case, beyond noting the \"tragedy\" it is causing for many people.\n\nShe did, however, note that the ACCC had been involved in a review of the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code since late 2023. Her comments:\n\n\"Part of the telecommunications regulatory system has an industry self-regulatory element to it. \"So there are codes that are developed by members of the industry, that can then, if they meet appropriate standards, be registered by the ACMA and meet the regulatory framework. \"Self-regulation effectively means that the industry, with inputs from others, writes the code and then submits that to the regulator for consideration. That is not the same as legislation or rules written by parliament. \"We would like to see a move from a self-regulatory treatment of some of these consumer protections to a direct regulatory treatment of some of those consumer protections. They are additional to some of the protections provided by Australian consumer law.\"\n\nYou can read more about the ACCC case against Optus here.",

Could a gene-editing therapy used to treat a young boy with a rare genetic condition help unlock treatments for others?\n\nLead researcher, Ed Wild of UCL's Huntington's Disease Centre, said that on the basis of the results, it seems likely AMT-130 will be the first licensed treatment to slow Huntington's disease.\n\n\"This result changes everything \u2026 truly world-changing stuff,\" he said.\n\nSome 29 patients took part in the trial with the 12 who were given the highest dose experiencing the greatest slowing of the disease.\n\nLeading international expert in Huntington's disease Julie Stout, from the school of psychological sciences at Monash University, told ABC News that, while the results of the trial are exciting, it may not be able to help people showing symptoms now.\n\n\"Maybe for their children we can hope for that, but we don't know how it will be delivered and how people will be able to afford it, how much government support there will be for it,\" she said.\n\n\"We can do this treatment in Australia, we have the neurosurgery expertise \u2026 that's not so much the issue but the regulatory process and the cost are going to be very significant.\"\n\nWhat is Huntington's disease?\n\nThere is currently no cure for Huntington's, a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a single genetic mutation.\n\nThe condition affects the brain and central nervous system, which progressively impairs mental and physical abilities, eventually leading to the loss of critical functions such as walking, talking, eating and reasoning.\n\nHuntington's disease breakthrough Photo shows A model of a brain About 2,000 people in Australia are affected by Huntington's disease, a fatal and incurable condition that affects the nervous system that results in the death of brain cells.\n\nAs it is an inherited condition, there are often several people in a family with Huntington's.\n\nHuntington's Australia said symptoms commonly begin between 30 and 50 years but can be earlier or later and, while the disease can begin in childhood, that is rarely seen in Australia.\n\nAround 2,500 people have been diagnosed with the condition in Australia, which affects movement, thinking and mood, but Professor Stout said there are probably between 7,000 and 10,000 at risk of developing the disease.\n\nDr Wild said the patients who took part in the trial were now stable \"in a way I'm not used to seeing in Huntington's disease\".\n\nUniqure said the positive top-line data from the pivotal phase I/II study of AMT-130 for the treatment of Huntington's disease demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of disease progression after three years.\n\nHuntington's disease carer anguish Photo shows A close up photo of a woman wearing glasses in front of a red tree Natalia Rossiter provides 24-hour care for her husband who has Huntington's disease, but she wonders how she can continue without psychological support.\n\nProfessor Stout said, that if the treatment is approved by regulators in Australia it could eventually help people with Huntington's have less severe symptoms.\n\n\"The kind of approach that we take in different forms of dementia is not so much looking for a cure, but if we could slow the disease down enough, people can live out their natural life span with a high quality of life,\" she said.\n\n\"That's like a cure from the point of view from dementia.\n\n\"The trick with Huntington's disease, because it has an early onset, we're doing a lot of slowing to get them to the point of the natural life span \u2026 it's likely they'll live with a more slowly progressing disease that has less severe symptoms.\n\n\"I think that's a huge win.\"\n\nAFP",

    "text": "Meninga\u2019s oversized guard became the stuff of legend but wouldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near a footy field today. \u201cI was at Canberra when Mal used to wear that guard and no one was game to near him at training in case you copped it,\u201d Bellamy said with a laugh. \u201cBut Hughesy\u2019s [guard] is a fair bit thinner than Mal\u2019s was.\u201d Bellamy also praised the toughness of second-rower Shawn Blore who will also return from a fractured larynx to play on Friday night. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty bad injury he got and he kept going in the game - he\u2019s a pretty tough unit,\u201d Bellamy said.\n\n\u201cHe was busting to get back. He kept ringing me and telling me that \u201cI\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u201d but, obviously, I\u2019m taking more advice from the medical people than him. We are confident he has recovered.\u201d The Storm thumped the Sharks 30-6 when they last met at AAMI Park in June but the Sharks have won nine games out of 10 since including knockout final wins over Sydney Roosters and minor premiers Canberra Raiders. So the Sharks will come in fired up as will a sellout crowd hoping to see the Storm progress to another grand final. \u201cI don\u2019t know who wrote them off. They finished fifth,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cTo beat the Roosters and then beat Canberra in Canberra - we know they are in good form, but we are just concerned with what we need to do and how we need to do it.\u201d\n\nBellamy felt for Pezet and several other Storm players who stepped up when key players were injured or suspended late this season. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way the game is, it isn\u2019t fair sometimes,\u201d Bellamy said. The Storm hammered the Sharks but it kick-started Cronulla\u2019s season Roy Ward The last time Cronulla trudged off AAMI Park they were at their lowest point of the season.\n\nSince that 30-6 round 17 loss to the Storm, the Sharks have won nine of 10 games, including two knockout finals, and are now just one win away from the NRL grand final. The only problem is that the team standing between them and the NRL decider is the Storm, who they take on at AAMI Park in a preliminary final on Friday night. Sharks playmaker Braydon Trindall remembers that night in June well, and how it galvanised his team to turn their season around. \u201cI think we were all just sick of letting the year slip away from us,\u201d Trindall recalled on Wednesday. \u201cSo we sat down and had a good talk about it and went out on the field and changed some of the actions that were hurting us.\n\n\u201cI think it was more of a club thing and everyone wanted to put in a bit more, and now look where we are.\u201d The Storm hammered the Sharks last time they met in Melbourne. Credit: Getty Images Trindall has carried an eye issue through recent games after taking a knock against the Sydney Roosters earlier in the finals, but while there is some visible blood, he said it had no impact on his vision. \u201cI copped a boot against the Roosters, but it\u2019s starting to heal now,\u201d he said. The Storm have plenty of respect for Trindall\u2019s kicking game and the threat it poses, but he knows accuracy is the key given the height and catching ability of Storm wingers Xavier Coates and Will Warbrick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good when you have some good chases on the end of the kick,\u201d he said. \u201cWill is a good leaper, so there will be a bit of a challenge there. It doesn\u2019t really change things. I might shorten the kicks up a bit so they have to run a bit more, but we\u2019ve got some good catches as well so I won\u2019t change much.\u201d Knights approach premiership-winning half to work as attack consultant Michael Chammas The Newcastle Knights have reached out to three-time premiership-winning playmaker Luke Keary about a role with the club as an attack and halves consultant from next season. Former Roosters playmaker Luke Keary could be heading to Newcastle. Credit: NRL Photos\n\nThe Knights are in the process of restructuring their coaching staff and have made the bold move to approach the recently retired Catalans pivot to gauge his interest in joining the club. Keary worked with both new coach Justin Holbrook and director of football Chris James at the Sydney Roosters and is highly regarded as one of the smartest players in rugby league. Keary, who spent this season with Catalans in the Super League after finishing his NRL career at the Sydney Roosters in 2024, is weighing up the opportunity. The 33-year-old wants to spend the summer travelling with his young family but is said to be keen to discuss the opportunity to link with the Knights. Newcastle are keen to add some specialised coaches to their ranks and believe Keary would be a huge asset to help work with recruits Dylan Brown and Sandon Smith, as well as incumbents Fletcher Sharpe and Kalyn Ponga.\n\nNewcastle\u2019s attack struggled to fire in 2025 under the guidance of attack coach Blake Green, who missed out on the job as Adam O\u2019Brien\u2019s successor to Holbrook. Keary doesn\u2019t have a job lined up at the Sydney Roosters, who themselves will welcome back Jared Waerea-Hargreaves in an official capacity to work with the club\u2019s younger players in 2026. \u2018Still a bit to get through\u2019: Storm star no certainty to face Sharks Roy Ward Melbourne Storm playmaker Jahrome Hughes still has some training sessions to get through before he can be cleared to play in the preliminary final on Friday night.\n\nThe reigning Dally M Medallist is recovering from a fractured forearm and racing against time to prove his arm has healed enough to take on Cronulla AAMI Park for a spot in the grand final next week. Hughes was named in Melbourne\u2019s extended squad on Tuesday in the hope he is fit to play by game day. Back-rower Shawn Blore (fractured larynx) and fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen (concussion) were also named but could still be left out if they aren\u2019t ruled fit to play. Storm captain Harry Grant said Hughes was looking good at training, but the club\u2019s tougher sessions were still to come before Craig Bellamy and his staff make a final call on selection. \u201cHe\u2019s been training pretty well and getting through what he has to do, but he still has a fair few things to get through with the week and how it builds up,\u201d Grant said on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s good for Hughesy, it\u2019s good for the team, but there is still a bit to get through.\u201d\n\nHughes has remained optimistic about a return on Friday night but the Storm\u2019s medical team have been more measured as the team does not want Hughes to re-injure himself.

Credit: Getty Images Young playmaker Jonah Pezet, who was also named in the squad, starred in the Storm\u2019s qualifying final win against the Bulldogs, and will be ready to start at halfback should the Storm decide Hughes is not ready. Grant said Hughes\u2019 passing game was looking good meaning the questions would be around his fitness and strength. \u201cWhen I throw him some shockers [bad passes], that makes it harder for his forearm,\u201d Grant joked. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it [the injury] has changed any of that.\u201d\n\nPapenhuyzen missed the qualifying final win over Canterbury with concussion, but his return to the No.1 jersey would see Nick Meaney shift back to the centres after filling in at fullback.

Credit: Getty Images Meanwhile, captain Adam Reynolds will return at halfback for the Broncos alongside new super-sub Ezra Mam against Penrith in Sunday\u2019s grand final qualifier. Both return from five-week lay-offs to a side unbeaten since the pair suffered hamstring injuries in round 23 against Melbourne. Reynolds said he was now \u201c100 per cent\u201d fit and ready to perform at No.7 after a minor training setback three weeks ago.\n\nMam has moved well at training the past week and done enough to convince coach Michael Maguire he is ready to shine. Instead of starting, the plan is for Mam to be injected into the match when fatigue sets in among his teammates, and utilise his renowned footwork to trouble the middle forwards and Penrith\u2019s edge defence. The Panthers will remember how dynamic Mam can be after his hat-trick of tries in the 2023 grand final, won 26-24 by Penrith. Mam and Reece Walsh combined for one of those tries in a lethal one-two punch. \u201cI am just really excited for him and to rub shoulders with him again on the field,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI feel like we have a really good connection and a really good instinct about each other. I\u2019m just ready to go after it with him.\u201d with AAP\n\nPanthers duo shrug off injury worries ahead of Broncos showdown Dan Walsh and Billie Eder Penrith\u2019s Liam Martin and Casey McLean insist they will be fit to play in Sunday\u2019s grand final qualifier against Brisbane after being forced from the field in the Panthers semi-final thumping of Canterbury. Martin was in obvious discomfort after he was tackled by former teammate Viliame Kikau, with the NSW and Kangaroos star staying down and struggling to breathe late in the contest. The 28-year-old came from the field and struggled to make his way up the Accor Stadium tunnel at one point, but he was in good spirits soon afterwards and said he was not concerned about any recurrence of a rib cartilage injury he carried through last year\u2019s finals.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all right now,\u201d Martin said of his ribs after full-time. \u201cThere was a bit of carry-on there. It\u2019s a bit sore at the moment, but they\u2019re all right. I landed on the ball, and \u2018Kiks\u2019 is a pretty big man, and he landed on me. I was a bit winded, but I\u2019m all right now. \u201cIt crossed my mind at first [that a serious injury may have occurred], but after a while I was like \u2018it\u2019s all right, I\u2019m being a sook again\u2019.\u201d Liam Martin is helped from the field at Accor Stadium. Credit: Getty Images Martin won last year\u2019s Clive Churchill medal against Melbourne despite playing through the pain of a popped rib cartilage in the 2024 grand final. He also required painkilling injections for almost the entire season to manage an ongoing AC joint injury in his shoulder, which he has battled again in recent weeks.",

Supplied Previous Slide Next Slide Chinese$$$$ Do you remember the last time you were on a road trip, your stomach clawing with hunger, and you succumbed to a lukewarm pie at the nearest servo? It felt a bit bleak, didn\u2019t it, parking beneath the fluorescent lights to rip open the plastic wrapping? Fighting to keep the gelatinous meat from oozing onto your lap. As you drive south through the Shoalhaven region and enter Nowra, the Princes Highway becomes a smorgasbord of sad pies and fast food outlets. It\u2019s one chain after another, and nothing to indicate that, at a fairy-lit concrete lot behind a pawn shop, there\u2019s a food truck serving some of the best dumplings you\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of eating. Weiqing \u201cElvina\u201d Yang in her food truck Fatty Dumpling Janie Barrett\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is Fatty Dumpling, where owner-cook Weiqing \u201cElvina\u201d Yang serves the kind of street food you\u2019re far more likely to find in Chongqing \u2013 the cyberpunk megacity in China\u2019s mountainous south-west \u2013 than in regional NSW. It\u2019s rich, warming and gloriously textural stuff: silky dumplings glossed in chilli oil; slow-braised spiced pork served tongguan roujiamo-style in a crisp golden bun made of layered, laminated dough; and beef soup noodles, tightly coiled in a pool of garlic-heavy red Sichuan heat. For Yang, this is the taste of home. It was the comfort food she turned to during the COVID pandemic, when international borders closed and the \u201ccouple of days\u201d she\u2019d planned to stay in Shoalhaven turned into a couple of years. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved food \u2013 Chinese food, my hometown\u2019s food \u2013 but there was nothing like [that] around Shoalhaven,\u201d Yang says. But first, she had to learn how to cook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYang, who formerly worked in sales, crowdsourced her first zhong dumpling recipe over phone calls with her grandparents (and friends\u2019 grandparents) back home in Zunyi, in Guizhou province. The dish originated more than a century ago in Chengdu, the capital of neighbouring Sichuan, and it was the first dish on the menu when Fatty Dumpling launched as a pop-up market stall in 2023. \u201cI had to experiment because [the ingredients] here were so different, but eventually, I was able to combine everything I learned and develop my own recipe,\u201d Yang says. \u201cI invited all of my friends to try it \u2026 because I wanted to create flavours that were not just authentic, but also approachable.\u201d The dumplings are delicate crescent moons filled with minced pork, boiled and served with a deep red sauce \u2013 part chilli oil and part sweet soy, pulsing with garlic and spice. There\u2019s an undercurrent of heat, more pleasant hum than scream, that compels you to keep eating, and eating, until somehow your plate is empty and, damn, maybe you should have ordered eight dumplings instead of five.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not their only fan. By 2024, Fatty Dumpling became so popular that Yang went all in, leasing and transforming an empty lot in Nowra\u2019s industrial precinct into a sun-beaten oasis, with a shiny silver trailer, potted cacti and an eclectic collection of weather-worn furniture, shaded by striped umbrellas and illuminated with string lights. It\u2019s a casual, seat-yourself affair with counter service and a small selection of canned soft drinks. Yang mostly works alone, sound-tracked by funk music on a Bluetooth speaker. She takes orders, cooks food, and shouts directions at customers: \u201cYou have to mix it!\u201d she tells a woman, starting on a bowl of \u201cMum\u2019s\u201d beef noodle soup. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way you can taste all the flavours!\u201d Mum\u2019s beef noodle soup doesn\u2019t come from Yang\u2019s mother, it should be said. In 2024, she returned to China for a research trip to Chongqing, navigating the city\u2019s vertical sprawl to find the best noodle shop. Barbara Noodles (wan za mian). \u201cI met a gentleman [Pang Shifu] who had been in this little shop for over 40 years, and I stayed there for a few days while he taught me his signature dishes \u2013 his mum\u2019s beef noodle soup and his [wan za mian] noodles, with all the secret ingredients,\u201d Yang says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wan za mian are sold at Fatty Dumpling as \u201cBarbara noodles\u201d and they\u2019re deliciously easy to enjoy: thin wheat noodles ladled with velvety yellow peas, sesame seeds, and brothy minced pork, balanced by bright, just-steamed greens and spring onions. The bowl is light, earthy and creamy \u2013 all the elements of a bestseller, as Yang predicted. Weiqing \u201cElvina\u201d Yang. Janie Barrett What she didn\u2019t predict was the impact cooking would have on her. It\u2019s been one year since Fatty Dumpling opened its permanent home, and in that time, she\u2019s developed a community of customers, regulars and close friends. \u201cFood is connection. I didn\u2019t grow up in Australia, I grew up in China, and I\u2019m proud of where I come from,\u201d Yang says. \u201cI wanted to give people the opportunity to know what authentic Chinese food is because that\u2019s my food. \u201cWhen I see them eat my food and smile, it makes me so happy. It makes me feel accepted by locals, and accepted by this place. That\u2019s really important to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree other places to eat in Nowra and surrounds Hyper Hyper Coffee A rustic shed made of corrugated iron, where both locals and visitors queue for house-roasted coffee made on vintage Italian espresso machines.

    "text": "Angeball is back. And surely, very soon, the results will reflect that accordingly.\n\nOn face value, it\u2019s been a tough start for Ange Postecoglou at Nottingham Forest: a 3-0 hiding away to Arsenal in his first match in charge, a gutting 3-2 defeat to Swansea in the Carabao Cup, then a 1-1 draw against newly promoted Burnley.\n\nThe first win of this new era should have come on Thursday morning (AEST) in Seville against Real Betis. They deserved to win; Forest were comfortably the better team, creating the better chances, threading together the better passages of play. If you\u2019re a believer in \u201cexpected goals\u201d, then you can take further comfort in those numbers: Postecoglou\u2019s men generated 3.27xG to just 0.49\n\nAnge Postecoglou is confident the wins will come. Credit: AP\n\nBut in reality, you have to turn expected goals into actual goals. And the sooner that Forest\u2019s frontline heeds that lesson, the sooner Postecoglou\u2019s critics will give him due credit for what he has built in the 16 days since his appointment.\n\nThe bones of a classic Postecoglou team are there already, and that\u2019s no mean feat given the team he inherited, the way they used to play, and the circumstances in which he replaced his beloved predecessor, Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\n\u201cI thought our football was outstanding at times in the first half,\u201d Postecoglou said post-match.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I could fault is we didn\u2019t put the game to bed. We should have really finished them off in the first half. There won\u2019t be many teams that come here and dominate like we did in that period. We just needed a third goal.\u201d\n\nCoached by the wily Manuel Pellegrini, Real Betis finished sixth in La Liga last season. And though they were missing a handful of their top-choice players, the trip to face them at the Estadio La Cartuja was, arguably, the toughest of Forest\u2019s eight initial fixtures in the Europa League, as they mark their return to continental football after a 30-year absence.\n\nAnge Postecoglou celebrates with Igor Jesus. Credit: AP\n\nTo come away with a 2-2 draw, then, isn\u2019t awful. But it is deflating.\n\nComing back from a goal down after Cedric Bakambu opened the scoring for the hosts after just 15 minutes, Forest\u2019s next half-hour was, at times, genuinely awe-inspiring. It was the most vivid display of Angeball in recent memory; certainly much better than anything Tottenham Hotspur produced in Postecoglou\u2019s last six or so months in that job.\n\nThe passing was crisp, the movement superb, the pressing relentless, and the energy high despite oppressive heat and humidity. Fans on social media described it as the best attacking football they\u2019d seen from their side in ... forever.\n\nThree minutes after Bakambu\u2019s opener, Igor Jesus became the first Forest player to score in Europe since 1996, capping a cracking left-to-right move by turning in Morgan Gibbs-White\u2019s pass across goal from point-blank range.\n\n\u201cI think the moments like the first goal, when they are constructed like that, are what make our game so beautiful,\u201d Postecoglou said.\n\nThen, five minutes later, he headed in a corner kick to make it 2-1 and further stamp his claims to become Postecoglou\u2019s first-choice striker.\n\nThe Brazilian, who joined Forest from Botafogo for a reported \u00a310 million in the off-season, had two further chances to make it a hat-trick, while Callum Hudson-Odoi also hit the post during their breathtaking purple patch. So it could have been, without hyperbole, 5-1 at the break.\n\nBut there was always a danger that a one-goal lead would not be sufficient, and so it proved. Partly due to the conditions, and partly due to the withdrawal at half-time of midfielder Douglas Luiz - who Postecoglou said had \u201cfelt\u201d his hamstring - Forest\u2019s grip on the match loosened. Still, they dealt well with whatever Betis threw at them, which wasn\u2019t much.\n\nMorgan Gibbs-White salutes the travelling fans. Credit: Getty Images\n\nFive minutes from full-time, however, came the sucker-punch. Teed up by substitute Marc Roca, Antony hammered in the equaliser at the back post, and the approximately 3000-odd travelling fans were left shattered.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just disappointed the players and the supporters don\u2019t get the rewards for our efforts. I\u2019ve just got to make sure they keep their heads up because there\u2019s plenty to be positive about,\u201d Postecoglou said.\n\n\u201cAnd the wins will come, if we keep playing our football like that.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong, but words alone won\u2019t convince the doubters, even though everyone on the inside seems to have bought into what he\u2019s trying to do. For external, vibes-based reasons, more than anything else, Postecoglou badly needs a win - and it needs to come in Sunday\u2019s clash (2.30am AEST) against Sunderland at home, or else the voices against him will get louder and more confident.",

    "text": "Their development program under former Lions great Nigel Lappin continues to identify and produce high-level AFL players from unlikely origins. Fourteen Cats in their preliminary final win over Hawthorn were selected with picks outside the top 30 of the draft. Most of them, in fact, were rookie or category B selections. Cats coach Chris Scott\u2019s ability to move and adjust with the game, year after year, and more importantly week after week, is why he is so often rated among the greatest all-time AFL coaches. Quality: Lions forward Zac Bailey. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images The craftsmen Small and mid-sized forwards can be hugely influential on grand final day. Just look at how often the Norm Smith Medal goes to one of these players, and how well-stocked both these teams are.\n\nThe Lions and Cats both have a battalion of crafty forwards who have a huge influence on their matches each and every week. With the quality quartet of Zac Bailey, Charlie Cameron, Kai Lohmann and Cam Rayner, the Lions probably have a slight edge in forward-50m work and direct scoreboard impact. Although not tall, all four are strong overhead and capable of being played one-out as a deep forward, meaning they pose a constant threat to their opposition. You just can\u2019t take your eyes off these four for a moment; even when they look like they\u2019re having a quiet day, any one of them could spring to life and turn a game Brisbane\u2019s way, as they\u2019ve done so many times before. Geelong\u2019s smaller forwards are just as impactful, but in a slightly different way. Tyson Stengle is the Geelong small who likes to play closer to goal; more like a typical forward pocket than Gryan Miers, Bradley Close or Shaun Mannagh. Those three provide the Cats with drive and connection. They each have an enormous work rate, which they use to get up the ground and provide their team with a linking option as the Cats surge forward off half-back. All of them are excellent kicks inside their team\u2019s forward 50m and regularly get involved in Geelong\u2019s scoring chains.\n\nHarass Andrews The Lions have the best defender in the grand final and the Cats have the best forward. But don\u2019t expect this game to be a throwback to the old days; there\u2019s little chance of Harris Andrews and Jeremy Cameron playing head-to-head on each other for long stretches of the match. Ryan Lester is the ultimate team man for the Lions. He is likely to get first crack at Cameron and will be comfortable if the Cat\u2019s superstar is taking marks up on centre wing and beyond. Lions defender Harris Andrews will be crucial to the contest. Credit: Getty Images The Cats might instruct Shannon Neale to use his running power to get in behind Andrews, or maybe recruit Jack Martin will be given the task of helping bring the ball to ground. Whatever the plan, Geelong\u2019s mission against Andrews will be crystal clear: don\u2019t let him mark the footy.\n\nIf they can stop him doing that, the Lions ability to rebound from defence will be seriously curtailed. The taskmasters Look out if the ball spills between Brisbane\u2019s Josh Dunkley and Geelong\u2019s Tom Atkins on Saturday. They are two of the most ferocious and selfless players in the AFL. In fact, only Brownlow medallist Matt Rowell (214) sits between Atkins (226 in first place) and Dunkley (third with 213) on the leaderboard of AFL tacklers in 2025. Tom Atkins is one of the most selfless and ferocious players in the AFL. Credit: Getty Images These two provide the quality control for their team at clearances and in contested situations. The grunt work they do is what allows their more heralded teammates to shine.\n\nIf Lachie Neale overcomes his calf injury and plays in the grand final, I expect Atkins will get the job of making sure the dual Brownlow medallist has limited impact on the contest, while still being tasked with driving the Cats forward, like he did in the preliminary final against Hawthorn. It\u2019s not as easy to predict what Dunkley\u2019s role will be. I\u2019ll be intrigued to see who Fagan assigns him to. Will it be one of Geelong\u2019s dash brothers \u2013 Bailey Smith or Max Holmes \u2013 or will he get the job of being kryptonite to the man who impersonated Superman for the Cats last week, skipper Patrick Dangerfield? Speaking of players being given assignments, Geelong have two magnificent Irishmen, Mark O\u2019Connor and Oisin Mullin, who are both likely to lock onto a Lions playmaker. The question is, will they be asked to repeat the roles they carried out so successfully at in their team\u2019s qualifying final win over the Lions \u2013 O\u2019Connor on Rayner and Mullin on Hugh McCluggage \u2013 or will Scott have another match-up in mind this time around? It\u2019s all part of what makes grand finals so special and intriguing \u2013 there will be match-ups all over the ground that could shape the result.\n\nIn the shoes of the coaches Putting myself in Chris Fagan\u2019s shoes my message to the Brisbane Lions players before they run out is simple: \u201cBe brave with the ball in hand, like you\u2019ve been all season. Take risks. Kick the ball with dare up the middle of the MCG, and test the Cats with your ball movement. This has been the formula for success against them all season. It\u2019s all about attitude. Yes, you will turn the ball over occasionally, we\u2019ll cop that. You simply must keep attacking them and going for your kicks. We can\u2019t let their back line get settled. That\u2019s what they want, especially without Tom Stewart, so let\u2019s break through and strike before they\u2019re ready.\u201d Premiership coach Chris Scott. Credit: Getty Images If I were Chris Scott, this would be my pre-game missive to the Cats:\n\nLoading \u201cWe must repeatedly outnumber them at the contest and spread from there. This is how we swung the momentum against the Hawks last week, and it\u2019s how we\u2019re going to beat the Lions. Speed on the ball is our friend. If we can take care of the contest first, we have the players and the running power to capitalise. Brisbane might be potent, but they won\u2019t be able to keep up with us if we win enough ball at the contest and spread from there.\u201d My tips Surprise, surprise you might say, I\u2019m tipping the Cats in what I\u2019m hoping will be an epic grand final. These teams have the talent, the appealing game styles and coaches with the tactical acumen for this to be a grand final for the ages; one that we will talk about for years to come. So for me, it\u2019s the Cats by three points, with Mannagh to be the Norm Smith medallist.",

    "text": "Eighteen was the great trophy when I was young: a driving licence, a drink in a pub without looking over the shoulder, the end of high school. Liberation. Somewhere along the track, birthdays discard their gloss until eventually, there comes the ticking down and the looking back. A long time ago, my father was celebrating his 80th birthday when he drew me aside. \u201cSon,\u201d he began, whispering. \u201cI know the years tell my age, but I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m much older than I was when I was about 25 or 30. Does it ever feel like that to you?\u201d \u201cI think everyone feels that at some point,\u201d I told him. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d said my father, expelling a great sigh. \u201cI thought I was the only one.\u201d\n\nBarry Humphries, comedian, author and satirist, said something similar. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a totally unfamiliar experience. You don\u2019t notice it, you see,\u201d he said of growing old. \u201cI find growing old is sad only in the sense that the world looks exactly the same as it did when I was young.\u201d The world doesn\u2019t look anything like what it seemed when I was young, it happens. But Humphries and my father were talking about something more poignant: that age had rendered them all but invisible within a world they still saw in the colours of youth.\n\nMy mate and I were talking about something different again as we discussed our excursions into the past to avoid the present. For a moment or two, we hit upon the sweet, moody memory of the 1973 movie, American Graffiti. It was set in small-town America over a single night in 1962, when a group of high school graduates, about to fly off to new lives, paid reluctant farewell to their teenage years, cruising the main street and confronting uncertainty about the future. Its soundtrack of rock \u2032n\u2019 roll, doo-wop, early surf music and ballads overlaid by the voice of the late US radio DJ, Wolfman Jack, still has the power to overwhelm listeners of a certain age. My mate and I did not live in small-town America in 1962, but its central theme of innocent longing resonates among those of us who were young even in Bob Menzies\u2019 less exciting Australia.\n\nAmerica\u2019s sense of moral certitude \u2013 and by extension, the Australia that relied so heavily on US supremacy \u2013 was shattered the following year when president John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Loading The culture of the 1960s became dominated by an increasingly meaningless war in Vietnam in which 1.3 million civilians and military died (most of them Vietnamese, though almost a quarter of a million were Americans and their allies, including more than 500 Australians). In 1968, both Martin Luther King Jr and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated. All these years later, that once-great nation that had such a cultural impact on the West, including Australia, has devolved to the point its president and his family openly enrich themselves while sooling the tamed Justice Department onto political enemies, universities, liberals, media companies, journalists and satirists.\n\nThis same president, turning his back and his ire onto oppressed peoples everywhere, spouts dangerous, utterly uninformed nonsense linking a common painkiller with autism, standing next to a black-sheep Kennedy with no scientific or medical background who as the US Secretary for Health (!) is undermining decades of the fight against communicable diseases by spouting more nonsense about vaccines. Loading As my mate and I continued our quest for sporadic havens, we inevitably got to the pleasures of watching the footy. But the AFL has lost its mind, we decided. How else to interpret the pro-women and anti-homophobic league\u2019s decision to pay American rapper Snoop Dogg $2 million to entertain the crowd at the grand final?\n\nHere is a fellow who built his career on the most vilely misogynistic lyrics and who has a history of homophobia, however much he claims to have cleaned up his act in recent times. Maybe he understands hypocrisy. Why, having declared in 2017 he would roast any black artist who performed for Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, he performed himself at the inaugural Crypto Ball in Washington on January 17 this year. It billed itself as an event \u201cintended to honour the 60th Presidential Inauguration, America\u2019s first \u2018crypto president\u2019, President-elect Donald J. Trump, his incoming cabinet and administration\u201d.",

The long-awaited next-generation planes, christened Outback Way (VH-OGB) and Great Ocean Road (VH-OGA), took to the skies on Thursday with an inaugural Sydney-Perth (departing at 11.07am, a little over half an hour late) and Sydney-Melbourne service in the evening (6.50pm). The inaugural Qantas A321XLR flight on the Sydney to Perth route takes off on Thursday. The new planes will replace Qantas\u2019 ageing Boeing 737s, and feature wider economy seats, larger windows and fast, free Wi-Fi. The aircraft also addresses a common passenger pain point: new larger overhead bins feature 60 per cent more baggage space. Last month, Qantas announced orders for an additional 20 A321XLRs, taking its total Airbus orders to 48 aircraft, in a bid to accelerate its fleet renewal program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrucially, the highly efficient single-aisle planes can fly 8700 kilometres \u2013 more than 3000 kilometres further than the 737 (the \u201cXLR\u201d in the A321\u2019s name stands for \u201cextra long range\u201d) \u2013 opening up more domestic and short-haul international routes for the airline, while taking pressure off existing crowded routes. While new international routes are yet to be confirmed for the A321XLR, Qantas domestic chief executive Markus Svensson said the extended range opened up the possibility of adding \u201cdestinations across South-East Asia and the Pacific Islands that are not viable with our current narrowbody fleet\u201d. Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson has previously indicated the aircraft will lead to an increase in routes to South-East Asia. Perth-India is also a possibility. The A321XLR increases seat capacity to 197 passengers. Five metres longer than its 737 predecessor, and with lower carbon emissions per seat, the new A321XLR can carry 197 passengers. It has 20 business class seats (up from 12) and 177 economy seats (up from 162), marking an overall 13 per cent increase in seat capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe additional capacity hasn\u2019t eaten into space between seats; economy remains unaffected, while business customers come out ahead with 66 per cent more legroom. Business class seats include wireless charging pads and an extendable cocktail table. Business class seats have a pitch of 37 inches (94 centimetres), with a recline of five inches (12.7 centimetres) and a six-way adjustable headrest, calf rest and footrest, with a 2-2 configuration. The seats feature reddish-brown leather covers, wireless charging pads and dual USB A and C charging ports, as well as an extendable cocktail table and in-arm tray table with built-in tablet holder. Economy seats are wider than those in the 737s at 17.6 inches (44.7 centimetres), up from 17 inches (43.2 centimetres), with a pitch of 30 inches (76.2 centimetres), in a 3-3 configuration. Seats feature extra cushioning, six-way leather adjustable headrests, drop-down device holders, adjustable meal tables and dual USB A and C charging ports. Economy seats are wider than those of the 737s at 17.6 inches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe redesigned seats incorporate new materials and a refreshed colour scheme, while the longer cabin\u2019s higher ceilings and larger windows invite more natural light, creating a brighter, more spacious feel. Virgin Australia\u2019s first Embraer 190-E2 aircraft touches down in Perth. While A321s flying domestic routes will not have seatback screens, Qantas has plans to configure 16 of the new aircraft with entertainment screens to service longer routes, including transcontinental flights from Perth, and short- and medium-haul international routes.

In more good news for domestic flyers, Virgin Australia took delivery of its first Embraer 190-E2 narrow-body jet earlier this month. The new aircraft will primarily service charter routes, while supporting regional routes in Western Australia from next month, including destinations like Darwin, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Port Hedland and Broome.

Her presence gives me peace.\n\nTina: When we met, work was my everything and I was happy to cruise through life and have a baby on my own. I was working at the grand prix as a business development manager for a mineral water brand. We\u2019d \u00adinvited some high-profile chefs along and Teage was one of them. He was quite drunk and I ended up chucking him in a cab and slamming the door. Three months later, I was at the George bar in St Kilda with friends. He walks in and sits next to me: \u201cYou\u2019re going to come on a date\u201d; \u201cNo, I\u2019m not, actually.\u201d He kept pursuing me. We started dating and that was it.\n\nTeage was open, passionate about life. He\u2019d been doing therapy, trying to find how broken he was and why his relationships fell apart. He was vulnerable. He\u2019d say things like \u201csee how bright the sky is?\u201d He was really raw and I enjoyed that. He\u2019d wake in the middle of the night after crazy dreams. I said \u201cwrite them down\u201d. He had ideas for all his restaurants [Ezard and Gingerboy in Melbourne, Black by Ezard in Sydney and Ezard at Levantine Hill in the Yarra Valley]. He had this amazing brain. It was attractive to see somebody function at this euphoric level.\n\n\u2018You lose parts of the person before they\u2019re physically gone.\u2019 Tina Ezard\n\nThe restaurants made for long, fast hours; the work didn\u2019t stop. If we weren\u2019t trying to fix a menu, do tastings or get a new product, we\u2019d travel to eat, locally and overseas. I helped him. I was happy, quietly behind closed doors. I\u2019d tell Teage \u201cbelieve in your instinct, your passion, because nothing can be a failure then\u201d. We\u2019ve had two kids \u2013 Sienna is 18, Kingston is 16 \u2013 but the restaurants were always Teage\u2019s first family, first love. I didn\u2019t mind: I love seeing people grow.",

    "text": "New inflation data \"almost certainly\" rules out a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cash rate cut when it meets next week, but a November cut is still a \"live option\", experts say.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) \u2014 a measure of the percentage change in the price of various household goods and services \u2014 rose 3 per cent in the 12 months to August, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) inflation data released today.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a further increase from the 2.8 per cent CPI rise in the 12 months to July, and 1.9 per cent in the year to June that the ABS has reported in recent months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The 3 per cent annual CPI inflation to August was up from 2.8 per cent to July, making this the highest annual inflation rate since July 2024 ,\" ABS head of prices statistics Michelle Marquardt said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest drivers of the price uptick were food and non-alcoholic beverages, which rose by 3 per cent, alcohol and tobacco by 6 per cent, and housing by 4.5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uptick in housing costs was primarily driven by electricity costs, which rose 24.6 per cent in the 12 months to August as government energy rebates ended and consumers faced higher out-of-pocket costs for electricity bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Marquardt said that, even if Commonwealth and state electricity rebates over the last year were excluded from the data, electricity prices rose by 5.9 per cent.\n\n\n\nSeptember rate cut highly unlikely\n\nSally Tindall, financial comparison site Canstar's data insights director, said mortgage holders shouldn't expect the RBA board to make any cash rate changes when it meets early next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The chance of a rate cut next week was wafer-thin to start with, and this [new inflation data] really just almost certainly rules it out,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile one reason for this was \"headline CPI moving in the wrong direction\", she highlighted that headline inflation isn't the central consideration in RBA cash rate decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe central bank treats the annual trimmed mean \u2014 a metric that smooths out certain volatile price movements \u2014 as a more reliable indicator of underlying inflation, and this figure decreased from 2.7 per cent in July to 2.6 in August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's slightly down from last month's result, but still at 2.6 per cent, that's above the RBA's midpoint of the [2-3 per cent] target band. And so I really think that rules out the chance of a rate cut next week,\" she added.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Why many Australians don't feel financially confident & ASX rises as market waits for US inflation SBS News 14:03 English\n\nIG Market analyst Tony Sycamore said this movement in annual trimmed mean inflation was broadly in line with the central bank's expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA\u2019s updated forecasts in August projected that inflation would \"fall back to the midpoint of that 2-3 per cent target band, and that's exactly what it did at 2.6 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think there were many people thinking they would cut rates in September, but absolutely not after today.\"\n\n\n\nNovember rate cut 'on the cards'\n\nSycamore said the latest figures were a solid basis for the RBA \"to continue its cautious rate-cutting cycle\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We expect the RBA to keep rates on hold in September, before cutting the cash rate by 25 basis points [0.25 percentage points] in November 2025, bringing it to 3.35 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not a rate cut that I would say is a 100 per cent guaranteed, but in terms of my conviction level, it is high ... it's probably a 70 per cent probability,\" he added.\n\n\n\nTindall said a rate cut when the RBA board meets in early November was \"a live option\" but would depend on labour force data and quarterly CPI data that would be received between now and then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is still very much on the cards in November,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The RBA has said that further easing is likely \u2014 that's code for at least one more cash rate cut [this year].\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, it also says that it's data-dependent, and it's not a guarantee that there will be further cash rate cuts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA board's last monetary policy meeting for the year will be in December.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 with additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

Don't take Tylenol. Don't take it. If you just can't, I mean, fight like hell not to take it. There may be a point where you have to and that you'll have to work out with yourself. So don't take Tylenol.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMainstream medical groups have responded strongly and quickly, saying the new recommendations are based on unsubstantiated and inconclusive research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drug, used to treat pain and fever, is known as paracetamol in Australia and many other parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States - it is known as acetaminophen and is marketed as tylenol.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has moved to change paracetamol product labels and issued a letter to physicians to say the decision belongs with parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers who've spent decades investigating potential causes of autism say the existing data doesn't support the Trump administration's claims.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutism expert and researcher at the University of Texas Dr Audrey Brumback says medicine is more individualised than Mr Trump is suggesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would say we have strong evidence that acetaminophen is not causing autism. It's certainly not the cause of autism. And so to make that sort of statement that nobody should take Tylenol, takes away the individualised nature of how we practice medicine and how these medicines are prescribed for families, for the people they are prescribed for both during pregnancy and for children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Therapeutic Goods Administration has also commented, re-confirming that paracetamol is safe for use in pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Medical Association (AMA) was also quick to dismiss Donald Trump's claims, reassuring Australian women of the safety of the drug, and that fever can cause more issues than paracetamol during a pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Danielle McMullen is the AMA President.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we can confidently say is that there is not data showing that paracetamol causes autism and that women should feel confident using paracetamol to manage pain or fever during pregnancy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not the first time Donald Trump has offered unusual medical advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID pandemic he had this to say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that has not been checked but you're going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the well-known vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Junior by his side, Donald Trump also announced millions of dollars in new funding for autism research, including a long-debunked theory that puts the blame on vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Hannah Kirk is a Senior Lecturer in Developmental Psychology at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says there are various reasons why rates of autism have increased in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that autism is a neurodevelopmental condition with no single known cause. I can't speculate on the reasons for their interest, but we do know that the rates of autism have increased and there is general consensus that the reason for that is broader definition in our diagnostic criteria of autism as well as broader public awareness.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration is also taking the first steps to try to approve a decades-old generic drug for a new group of patients, including some who may have autism.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency said it will seek approval of leucovorin for patients believed to have low levels of folate, one form of vitamin B, in the brain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may include some people with autism.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency\u2019s move is based on a review of small studies performed between 2009 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kirk says there is not enough evidence to support claims that leucovorin is a treatment for autism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that folate is really important for the development of the central nervous system, and some studies including individuals with autism have shown that there's difficulty in folate metabolism in some individuals with autism. So in theory, this approach could be beneficial, but there's simply just not enough evidence at this point to advocate for it being used as a treatment or a therapy for individuals with autism.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler says his department is looking closely at health announcements from the US, particularly if it comes through the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n\n",

Now they are being confronted yet again with an attempt to destroy our nation altogether. Recognition of the state of Palestine is an affirmation that the world rejects such denial, rejects the attempts at our destruction and supports our right to existence, our right to self-determination.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ABC has been fined $150,000 for unlawfully sacking journalist Antoinette Lattouf, after she shared a Human Rights Watch post on Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe penalty has been levied in the Federal Court, which found the public broadcaster breached workplace law when it sacked Ms Lattouf from her casual role on ABC Radio Sydney's Mornings program in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ABC has 28 days to pay the fine, which comes in addition to the $70,000 in damages she was previously awarded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport and in cricket news, England has named 16 players for its five-test series with Australia that begins in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Woakes, whose last act as an England player was to bat with a dislocated shoulder on the dramatic last day of the England-India series has not been included.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selections mean the English will come to Australia with a battery of pace bowlers to spearhead their attempt to regain the Ashes but with questions over their batting line-up and the fitness of several players.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Meninga\u2019s oversized guard became the stuff of legend but wouldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near a footy field today. \u201cI was at Canberra when Mal used to wear that guard and no one was game to near him at training in case you copped it,\u201d Bellamy said with a laugh. \u201cBut Hughesy\u2019s [guard] is a fair bit thinner than Mal\u2019s was.\u201d Bellamy also praised the toughness of second-rower Shawn Blore who will also return from a fractured larynx to play on Friday night. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty bad injury he got and he kept going in the game - he\u2019s a pretty tough unit,\u201d Bellamy said.\n\n\u201cHe was busting to get back. He kept ringing me and telling me that \u201cI\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u201d but, obviously, I\u2019m taking more advice from the medical people than him. We are confident he has recovered.\u201d The Storm thumped the Sharks 30-6 when they last met at AAMI Park in June but the Sharks have won nine games out of 10 since including knockout final wins over Sydney Roosters and minor premiers Canberra Raiders. So the Sharks will come in fired up as will a sellout crowd hoping to see the Storm progress to another grand final. \u201cI don\u2019t know who wrote them off. They finished fifth,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cTo beat the Roosters and then beat Canberra in Canberra - we know they are in good form, but we are just concerned with what we need to do and how we need to do it.\u201d\n\nBellamy felt for Pezet and several other Storm players who stepped up when key players were injured or suspended late this season. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way the game is, it isn\u2019t fair sometimes,\u201d Bellamy said. The Storm hammered the Sharks but it kick-started Cronulla\u2019s season Roy Ward The last time Cronulla trudged off AAMI Park they were at their lowest point of the season.\n\nSince that 30-6 round 17 loss to the Storm, the Sharks have won nine of 10 games, including two knockout finals, and are now just one win away from the NRL grand final. The only problem is that the team standing between them and the NRL decider is the Storm, who they take on at AAMI Park in a preliminary final on Friday night. Sharks playmaker Braydon Trindall remembers that night in June well, and how it galvanised his team to turn their season around. \u201cI think we were all just sick of letting the year slip away from us,\u201d Trindall recalled on Wednesday. \u201cSo we sat down and had a good talk about it and went out on the field and changed some of the actions that were hurting us.\n\n\u201cI think it was more of a club thing and everyone wanted to put in a bit more, and now look where we are.\u201d The Storm hammered the Sharks last time they met in Melbourne. Credit: Getty Images Trindall has carried an eye issue through recent games after taking a knock against the Sydney Roosters earlier in the finals, but while there is some visible blood, he said it had no impact on his vision. \u201cI copped a boot against the Roosters, but it\u2019s starting to heal now,\u201d he said. The Storm have plenty of respect for Trindall\u2019s kicking game and the threat it poses, but he knows accuracy is the key given the height and catching ability of Storm wingers Xavier Coates and Will Warbrick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good when you have some good chases on the end of the kick,\u201d he said. \u201cWill is a good leaper, so there will be a bit of a challenge there. It doesn\u2019t really change things. I might shorten the kicks up a bit so they have to run a bit more, but we\u2019ve got some good catches as well so I won\u2019t change much.\u201d Knights approach premiership-winning half to work as attack consultant Michael Chammas The Newcastle Knights have reached out to three-time premiership-winning playmaker Luke Keary about a role with the club as an attack and halves consultant from next season. Former Roosters playmaker Luke Keary could be heading to Newcastle. Credit: NRL Photos\n\nThe Knights are in the process of restructuring their coaching staff and have made the bold move to approach the recently retired Catalans pivot to gauge his interest in joining the club. Keary worked with both new coach Justin Holbrook and director of football Chris James at the Sydney Roosters and is highly regarded as one of the smartest players in rugby league. Keary, who spent this season with Catalans in the Super League after finishing his NRL career at the Sydney Roosters in 2024, is weighing up the opportunity. The 33-year-old wants to spend the summer travelling with his young family but is said to be keen to discuss the opportunity to link with the Knights. Newcastle are keen to add some specialised coaches to their ranks and believe Keary would be a huge asset to help work with recruits Dylan Brown and Sandon Smith, as well as incumbents Fletcher Sharpe and Kalyn Ponga.\n\nNewcastle\u2019s attack struggled to fire in 2025 under the guidance of attack coach Blake Green, who missed out on the job as Adam O\u2019Brien\u2019s successor to Holbrook. Keary doesn\u2019t have a job lined up at the Sydney Roosters, who themselves will welcome back Jared Waerea-Hargreaves in an official capacity to work with the club\u2019s younger players in 2026. \u2018Still a bit to get through\u2019: Storm star no certainty to face Sharks Roy Ward Melbourne Storm playmaker Jahrome Hughes still has some training sessions to get through before he can be cleared to play in the preliminary final on Friday night.\n\nThe reigning Dally M Medallist is recovering from a fractured forearm and racing against time to prove his arm has healed enough to take on Cronulla AAMI Park for a spot in the grand final next week. Hughes was named in Melbourne\u2019s extended squad on Tuesday in the hope he is fit to play by game day. Back-rower Shawn Blore (fractured larynx) and fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen (concussion) were also named but could still be left out if they aren\u2019t ruled fit to play. Storm captain Harry Grant said Hughes was looking good at training, but the club\u2019s tougher sessions were still to come before Craig Bellamy and his staff make a final call on selection. \u201cHe\u2019s been training pretty well and getting through what he has to do, but he still has a fair few things to get through with the week and how it builds up,\u201d Grant said on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s good for Hughesy, it\u2019s good for the team, but there is still a bit to get through.\u201d\n\nHughes has remained optimistic about a return on Friday night but the Storm\u2019s medical team have been more measured as the team does not want Hughes to re-injure himself.

Credit: Getty Images Young playmaker Jonah Pezet, who was also named in the squad, starred in the Storm\u2019s qualifying final win against the Bulldogs, and will be ready to start at halfback should the Storm decide Hughes is not ready. Grant said Hughes\u2019 passing game was looking good meaning the questions would be around his fitness and strength. \u201cWhen I throw him some shockers [bad passes], that makes it harder for his forearm,\u201d Grant joked. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it [the injury] has changed any of that.\u201d\n\nPapenhuyzen missed the qualifying final win over Canterbury with concussion, but his return to the No.1 jersey would see Nick Meaney shift back to the centres after filling in at fullback.

Credit: Getty Images Meanwhile, captain Adam Reynolds will return at halfback for the Broncos alongside new super-sub Ezra Mam against Penrith in Sunday\u2019s grand final qualifier. Both return from five-week lay-offs to a side unbeaten since the pair suffered hamstring injuries in round 23 against Melbourne. Reynolds said he was now \u201c100 per cent\u201d fit and ready to perform at No.7 after a minor training setback three weeks ago.\n\nMam has moved well at training the past week and done enough to convince coach Michael Maguire he is ready to shine. Instead of starting, the plan is for Mam to be injected into the match when fatigue sets in among his teammates, and utilise his renowned footwork to trouble the middle forwards and Penrith\u2019s edge defence. The Panthers will remember how dynamic Mam can be after his hat-trick of tries in the 2023 grand final, won 26-24 by Penrith. Mam and Reece Walsh combined for one of those tries in a lethal one-two punch. \u201cI am just really excited for him and to rub shoulders with him again on the field,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI feel like we have a really good connection and a really good instinct about each other. I\u2019m just ready to go after it with him.\u201d with AAP\n\nPanthers duo shrug off injury worries ahead of Broncos showdown Dan Walsh and Billie Eder Penrith\u2019s Liam Martin and Casey McLean insist they will be fit to play in Sunday\u2019s grand final qualifier against Brisbane after being forced from the field in the Panthers semi-final thumping of Canterbury. Martin was in obvious discomfort after he was tackled by former teammate Viliame Kikau, with the NSW and Kangaroos star staying down and struggling to breathe late in the contest. The 28-year-old came from the field and struggled to make his way up the Accor Stadium tunnel at one point, but he was in good spirits soon afterwards and said he was not concerned about any recurrence of a rib cartilage injury he carried through last year\u2019s finals.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all right now,\u201d Martin said of his ribs after full-time. \u201cThere was a bit of carry-on there. It\u2019s a bit sore at the moment, but they\u2019re all right. I landed on the ball, and \u2018Kiks\u2019 is a pretty big man, and he landed on me. I was a bit winded, but I\u2019m all right now. \u201cIt crossed my mind at first [that a serious injury may have occurred], but after a while I was like \u2018it\u2019s all right, I\u2019m being a sook again\u2019.\u201d Liam Martin is helped from the field at Accor Stadium. Credit: Getty Images Martin won last year\u2019s Clive Churchill medal against Melbourne despite playing through the pain of a popped rib cartilage in the 2024 grand final. He also required painkilling injections for almost the entire season to manage an ongoing AC joint injury in his shoulder, which he has battled again in recent weeks.",

Supplied Previous Slide Next Slide Chinese$$$$ Do you remember the last time you were on a road trip, your stomach clawing with hunger, and you succumbed to a lukewarm pie at the nearest servo? It felt a bit bleak, didn\u2019t it, parking beneath the fluorescent lights to rip open the plastic wrapping? Fighting to keep the gelatinous meat from oozing onto your lap. As you drive south through the Shoalhaven region and enter Nowra, the Princes Highway becomes a smorgasbord of sad pies and fast food outlets. It\u2019s one chain after another, and nothing to indicate that, at a fairy-lit concrete lot behind a pawn shop, there\u2019s a food truck serving some of the best dumplings you\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of eating. Weiqing \u201cElvina\u201d Yang in her food truck Fatty Dumpling Janie Barrett\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is Fatty Dumpling, where owner-cook Weiqing \u201cElvina\u201d Yang serves the kind of street food you\u2019re far more likely to find in Chongqing \u2013 the cyberpunk megacity in China\u2019s mountainous south-west \u2013 than in regional NSW. It\u2019s rich, warming and gloriously textural stuff: silky dumplings glossed in chilli oil; slow-braised spiced pork served tongguan roujiamo-style in a crisp golden bun made of layered, laminated dough; and beef soup noodles, tightly coiled in a pool of garlic-heavy red Sichuan heat. For Yang, this is the taste of home. It was the comfort food she turned to during the COVID pandemic, when international borders closed and the \u201ccouple of days\u201d she\u2019d planned to stay in Shoalhaven turned into a couple of years. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved food \u2013 Chinese food, my hometown\u2019s food \u2013 but there was nothing like [that] around Shoalhaven,\u201d Yang says. But first, she had to learn how to cook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYang, who formerly worked in sales, crowdsourced her first zhong dumpling recipe over phone calls with her grandparents (and friends\u2019 grandparents) back home in Zunyi, in Guizhou province. The dish originated more than a century ago in Chengdu, the capital of neighbouring Sichuan, and it was the first dish on the menu when Fatty Dumpling launched as a pop-up market stall in 2023. \u201cI had to experiment because [the ingredients] here were so different, but eventually, I was able to combine everything I learned and develop my own recipe,\u201d Yang says. \u201cI invited all of my friends to try it \u2026 because I wanted to create flavours that were not just authentic, but also approachable.\u201d The dumplings are delicate crescent moons filled with minced pork, boiled and served with a deep red sauce \u2013 part chilli oil and part sweet soy, pulsing with garlic and spice. There\u2019s an undercurrent of heat, more pleasant hum than scream, that compels you to keep eating, and eating, until somehow your plate is empty and, damn, maybe you should have ordered eight dumplings instead of five.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not their only fan. By 2024, Fatty Dumpling became so popular that Yang went all in, leasing and transforming an empty lot in Nowra\u2019s industrial precinct into a sun-beaten oasis, with a shiny silver trailer, potted cacti and an eclectic collection of weather-worn furniture, shaded by striped umbrellas and illuminated with string lights. It\u2019s a casual, seat-yourself affair with counter service and a small selection of canned soft drinks. Yang mostly works alone, sound-tracked by funk music on a Bluetooth speaker. She takes orders, cooks food, and shouts directions at customers: \u201cYou have to mix it!\u201d she tells a woman, starting on a bowl of \u201cMum\u2019s\u201d beef noodle soup. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way you can taste all the flavours!\u201d Mum\u2019s beef noodle soup doesn\u2019t come from Yang\u2019s mother, it should be said. In 2024, she returned to China for a research trip to Chongqing, navigating the city\u2019s vertical sprawl to find the best noodle shop. Barbara Noodles (wan za mian). \u201cI met a gentleman [Pang Shifu] who had been in this little shop for over 40 years, and I stayed there for a few days while he taught me his signature dishes \u2013 his mum\u2019s beef noodle soup and his [wan za mian] noodles, with all the secret ingredients,\u201d Yang says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wan za mian are sold at Fatty Dumpling as \u201cBarbara noodles\u201d and they\u2019re deliciously easy to enjoy: thin wheat noodles ladled with velvety yellow peas, sesame seeds, and brothy minced pork, balanced by bright, just-steamed greens and spring onions. The bowl is light, earthy and creamy \u2013 all the elements of a bestseller, as Yang predicted. Weiqing \u201cElvina\u201d Yang. Janie Barrett What she didn\u2019t predict was the impact cooking would have on her. It\u2019s been one year since Fatty Dumpling opened its permanent home, and in that time, she\u2019s developed a community of customers, regulars and close friends. \u201cFood is connection. I didn\u2019t grow up in Australia, I grew up in China, and I\u2019m proud of where I come from,\u201d Yang says. \u201cI wanted to give people the opportunity to know what authentic Chinese food is because that\u2019s my food. \u201cWhen I see them eat my food and smile, it makes me so happy. It makes me feel accepted by locals, and accepted by this place. That\u2019s really important to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree other places to eat in Nowra and surrounds Hyper Hyper Coffee A rustic shed made of corrugated iron, where both locals and visitors queue for house-roasted coffee made on vintage Italian espresso machines.

    "text": "Angeball is back. And surely, very soon, the results will reflect that accordingly.\n\nOn face value, it\u2019s been a tough start for Ange Postecoglou at Nottingham Forest: a 3-0 hiding away to Arsenal in his first match in charge, a gutting 3-2 defeat to Swansea in the Carabao Cup, then a 1-1 draw against newly promoted Burnley.\n\nThe first win of this new era should have come on Thursday morning (AEST) in Seville against Real Betis. They deserved to win; Forest were comfortably the better team, creating the better chances, threading together the better passages of play. If you\u2019re a believer in \u201cexpected goals\u201d, then you can take further comfort in those numbers: Postecoglou\u2019s men generated 3.27xG to just 0.49\n\nAnge Postecoglou is confident the wins will come. Credit: AP\n\nBut in reality, you have to turn expected goals into actual goals. And the sooner that Forest\u2019s frontline heeds that lesson, the sooner Postecoglou\u2019s critics will give him due credit for what he has built in the 16 days since his appointment.\n\nThe bones of a classic Postecoglou team are there already, and that\u2019s no mean feat given the team he inherited, the way they used to play, and the circumstances in which he replaced his beloved predecessor, Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\n\u201cI thought our football was outstanding at times in the first half,\u201d Postecoglou said post-match.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I could fault is we didn\u2019t put the game to bed. We should have really finished them off in the first half. There won\u2019t be many teams that come here and dominate like we did in that period. We just needed a third goal.\u201d\n\nCoached by the wily Manuel Pellegrini, Real Betis finished sixth in La Liga last season. And though they were missing a handful of their top-choice players, the trip to face them at the Estadio La Cartuja was, arguably, the toughest of Forest\u2019s eight initial fixtures in the Europa League, as they mark their return to continental football after a 30-year absence.\n\nAnge Postecoglou celebrates with Igor Jesus. Credit: AP\n\nTo come away with a 2-2 draw, then, isn\u2019t awful. But it is deflating.\n\nComing back from a goal down after Cedric Bakambu opened the scoring for the hosts after just 15 minutes, Forest\u2019s next half-hour was, at times, genuinely awe-inspiring. It was the most vivid display of Angeball in recent memory; certainly much better than anything Tottenham Hotspur produced in Postecoglou\u2019s last six or so months in that job.\n\nThe passing was crisp, the movement superb, the pressing relentless, and the energy high despite oppressive heat and humidity. Fans on social media described it as the best attacking football they\u2019d seen from their side in ... forever.\n\nThree minutes after Bakambu\u2019s opener, Igor Jesus became the first Forest player to score in Europe since 1996, capping a cracking left-to-right move by turning in Morgan Gibbs-White\u2019s pass across goal from point-blank range.\n\n\u201cI think the moments like the first goal, when they are constructed like that, are what make our game so beautiful,\u201d Postecoglou said.\n\nThen, five minutes later, he headed in a corner kick to make it 2-1 and further stamp his claims to become Postecoglou\u2019s first-choice striker.\n\nThe Brazilian, who joined Forest from Botafogo for a reported \u00a310 million in the off-season, had two further chances to make it a hat-trick, while Callum Hudson-Odoi also hit the post during their breathtaking purple patch. So it could have been, without hyperbole, 5-1 at the break.\n\nBut there was always a danger that a one-goal lead would not be sufficient, and so it proved. Partly due to the conditions, and partly due to the withdrawal at half-time of midfielder Douglas Luiz - who Postecoglou said had \u201cfelt\u201d his hamstring - Forest\u2019s grip on the match loosened. Still, they dealt well with whatever Betis threw at them, which wasn\u2019t much.\n\nMorgan Gibbs-White salutes the travelling fans. Credit: Getty Images\n\nFive minutes from full-time, however, came the sucker-punch. Teed up by substitute Marc Roca, Antony hammered in the equaliser at the back post, and the approximately 3000-odd travelling fans were left shattered.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just disappointed the players and the supporters don\u2019t get the rewards for our efforts. I\u2019ve just got to make sure they keep their heads up because there\u2019s plenty to be positive about,\u201d Postecoglou said.\n\n\u201cAnd the wins will come, if we keep playing our football like that.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong, but words alone won\u2019t convince the doubters, even though everyone on the inside seems to have bought into what he\u2019s trying to do. For external, vibes-based reasons, more than anything else, Postecoglou badly needs a win - and it needs to come in Sunday\u2019s clash (2.30am AEST) against Sunderland at home, or else the voices against him will get louder and more confident.",

    "text": "Their development program under former Lions great Nigel Lappin continues to identify and produce high-level AFL players from unlikely origins. Fourteen Cats in their preliminary final win over Hawthorn were selected with picks outside the top 30 of the draft. Most of them, in fact, were rookie or category B selections. Cats coach Chris Scott\u2019s ability to move and adjust with the game, year after year, and more importantly week after week, is why he is so often rated among the greatest all-time AFL coaches. Quality: Lions forward Zac Bailey. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images The craftsmen Small and mid-sized forwards can be hugely influential on grand final day. Just look at how often the Norm Smith Medal goes to one of these players, and how well-stocked both these teams are.\n\nThe Lions and Cats both have a battalion of crafty forwards who have a huge influence on their matches each and every week. With the quality quartet of Zac Bailey, Charlie Cameron, Kai Lohmann and Cam Rayner, the Lions probably have a slight edge in forward-50m work and direct scoreboard impact. Although not tall, all four are strong overhead and capable of being played one-out as a deep forward, meaning they pose a constant threat to their opposition. You just can\u2019t take your eyes off these four for a moment; even when they look like they\u2019re having a quiet day, any one of them could spring to life and turn a game Brisbane\u2019s way, as they\u2019ve done so many times before. Geelong\u2019s smaller forwards are just as impactful, but in a slightly different way. Tyson Stengle is the Geelong small who likes to play closer to goal; more like a typical forward pocket than Gryan Miers, Bradley Close or Shaun Mannagh. Those three provide the Cats with drive and connection. They each have an enormous work rate, which they use to get up the ground and provide their team with a linking option as the Cats surge forward off half-back. All of them are excellent kicks inside their team\u2019s forward 50m and regularly get involved in Geelong\u2019s scoring chains.\n\nHarass Andrews The Lions have the best defender in the grand final and the Cats have the best forward. But don\u2019t expect this game to be a throwback to the old days; there\u2019s little chance of Harris Andrews and Jeremy Cameron playing head-to-head on each other for long stretches of the match. Ryan Lester is the ultimate team man for the Lions. He is likely to get first crack at Cameron and will be comfortable if the Cat\u2019s superstar is taking marks up on centre wing and beyond. Lions defender Harris Andrews will be crucial to the contest. Credit: Getty Images The Cats might instruct Shannon Neale to use his running power to get in behind Andrews, or maybe recruit Jack Martin will be given the task of helping bring the ball to ground. Whatever the plan, Geelong\u2019s mission against Andrews will be crystal clear: don\u2019t let him mark the footy.\n\nIf they can stop him doing that, the Lions ability to rebound from defence will be seriously curtailed. The taskmasters Look out if the ball spills between Brisbane\u2019s Josh Dunkley and Geelong\u2019s Tom Atkins on Saturday. They are two of the most ferocious and selfless players in the AFL. In fact, only Brownlow medallist Matt Rowell (214) sits between Atkins (226 in first place) and Dunkley (third with 213) on the leaderboard of AFL tacklers in 2025. Tom Atkins is one of the most selfless and ferocious players in the AFL. Credit: Getty Images These two provide the quality control for their team at clearances and in contested situations. The grunt work they do is what allows their more heralded teammates to shine.\n\nIf Lachie Neale overcomes his calf injury and plays in the grand final, I expect Atkins will get the job of making sure the dual Brownlow medallist has limited impact on the contest, while still being tasked with driving the Cats forward, like he did in the preliminary final against Hawthorn. It\u2019s not as easy to predict what Dunkley\u2019s role will be. I\u2019ll be intrigued to see who Fagan assigns him to. Will it be one of Geelong\u2019s dash brothers \u2013 Bailey Smith or Max Holmes \u2013 or will he get the job of being kryptonite to the man who impersonated Superman for the Cats last week, skipper Patrick Dangerfield? Speaking of players being given assignments, Geelong have two magnificent Irishmen, Mark O\u2019Connor and Oisin Mullin, who are both likely to lock onto a Lions playmaker. The question is, will they be asked to repeat the roles they carried out so successfully at in their team\u2019s qualifying final win over the Lions \u2013 O\u2019Connor on Rayner and Mullin on Hugh McCluggage \u2013 or will Scott have another match-up in mind this time around? It\u2019s all part of what makes grand finals so special and intriguing \u2013 there will be match-ups all over the ground that could shape the result.\n\nIn the shoes of the coaches Putting myself in Chris Fagan\u2019s shoes my message to the Brisbane Lions players before they run out is simple: \u201cBe brave with the ball in hand, like you\u2019ve been all season. Take risks. Kick the ball with dare up the middle of the MCG, and test the Cats with your ball movement. This has been the formula for success against them all season. It\u2019s all about attitude. Yes, you will turn the ball over occasionally, we\u2019ll cop that. You simply must keep attacking them and going for your kicks. We can\u2019t let their back line get settled. That\u2019s what they want, especially without Tom Stewart, so let\u2019s break through and strike before they\u2019re ready.\u201d Premiership coach Chris Scott. Credit: Getty Images If I were Chris Scott, this would be my pre-game missive to the Cats:\n\nLoading \u201cWe must repeatedly outnumber them at the contest and spread from there. This is how we swung the momentum against the Hawks last week, and it\u2019s how we\u2019re going to beat the Lions. Speed on the ball is our friend. If we can take care of the contest first, we have the players and the running power to capitalise. Brisbane might be potent, but they won\u2019t be able to keep up with us if we win enough ball at the contest and spread from there.\u201d My tips Surprise, surprise you might say, I\u2019m tipping the Cats in what I\u2019m hoping will be an epic grand final. These teams have the talent, the appealing game styles and coaches with the tactical acumen for this to be a grand final for the ages; one that we will talk about for years to come. So for me, it\u2019s the Cats by three points, with Mannagh to be the Norm Smith medallist.",

    "text": "Eighteen was the great trophy when I was young: a driving licence, a drink in a pub without looking over the shoulder, the end of high school. Liberation. Somewhere along the track, birthdays discard their gloss until eventually, there comes the ticking down and the looking back. A long time ago, my father was celebrating his 80th birthday when he drew me aside. \u201cSon,\u201d he began, whispering. \u201cI know the years tell my age, but I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m much older than I was when I was about 25 or 30. Does it ever feel like that to you?\u201d \u201cI think everyone feels that at some point,\u201d I told him. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d said my father, expelling a great sigh. \u201cI thought I was the only one.\u201d\n\nBarry Humphries, comedian, author and satirist, said something similar. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a totally unfamiliar experience. You don\u2019t notice it, you see,\u201d he said of growing old. \u201cI find growing old is sad only in the sense that the world looks exactly the same as it did when I was young.\u201d The world doesn\u2019t look anything like what it seemed when I was young, it happens. But Humphries and my father were talking about something more poignant: that age had rendered them all but invisible within a world they still saw in the colours of youth.\n\nMy mate and I were talking about something different again as we discussed our excursions into the past to avoid the present. For a moment or two, we hit upon the sweet, moody memory of the 1973 movie, American Graffiti. It was set in small-town America over a single night in 1962, when a group of high school graduates, about to fly off to new lives, paid reluctant farewell to their teenage years, cruising the main street and confronting uncertainty about the future. Its soundtrack of rock \u2032n\u2019 roll, doo-wop, early surf music and ballads overlaid by the voice of the late US radio DJ, Wolfman Jack, still has the power to overwhelm listeners of a certain age. My mate and I did not live in small-town America in 1962, but its central theme of innocent longing resonates among those of us who were young even in Bob Menzies\u2019 less exciting Australia.\n\nAmerica\u2019s sense of moral certitude \u2013 and by extension, the Australia that relied so heavily on US supremacy \u2013 was shattered the following year when president John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Loading The culture of the 1960s became dominated by an increasingly meaningless war in Vietnam in which 1.3 million civilians and military died (most of them Vietnamese, though almost a quarter of a million were Americans and their allies, including more than 500 Australians). In 1968, both Martin Luther King Jr and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated. All these years later, that once-great nation that had such a cultural impact on the West, including Australia, has devolved to the point its president and his family openly enrich themselves while sooling the tamed Justice Department onto political enemies, universities, liberals, media companies, journalists and satirists.\n\nThis same president, turning his back and his ire onto oppressed peoples everywhere, spouts dangerous, utterly uninformed nonsense linking a common painkiller with autism, standing next to a black-sheep Kennedy with no scientific or medical background who as the US Secretary for Health (!) is undermining decades of the fight against communicable diseases by spouting more nonsense about vaccines. Loading As my mate and I continued our quest for sporadic havens, we inevitably got to the pleasures of watching the footy. But the AFL has lost its mind, we decided. How else to interpret the pro-women and anti-homophobic league\u2019s decision to pay American rapper Snoop Dogg $2 million to entertain the crowd at the grand final?\n\nHere is a fellow who built his career on the most vilely misogynistic lyrics and who has a history of homophobia, however much he claims to have cleaned up his act in recent times. Maybe he understands hypocrisy. Why, having declared in 2017 he would roast any black artist who performed for Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, he performed himself at the inaugural Crypto Ball in Washington on January 17 this year. It billed itself as an event \u201cintended to honour the 60th Presidential Inauguration, America\u2019s first \u2018crypto president\u2019, President-elect Donald J. Trump, his incoming cabinet and administration\u201d.",

The long-awaited next-generation planes, christened Outback Way (VH-OGB) and Great Ocean Road (VH-OGA), took to the skies on Thursday with an inaugural Sydney-Perth (departing at 11.07am, a little over half an hour late) and Sydney-Melbourne service in the evening (6.50pm). The inaugural Qantas A321XLR flight on the Sydney to Perth route takes off on Thursday. The new planes will replace Qantas\u2019 ageing Boeing 737s, and feature wider economy seats, larger windows and fast, free Wi-Fi. The aircraft also addresses a common passenger pain point: new larger overhead bins feature 60 per cent more baggage space. Last month, Qantas announced orders for an additional 20 A321XLRs, taking its total Airbus orders to 48 aircraft, in a bid to accelerate its fleet renewal program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrucially, the highly efficient single-aisle planes can fly 8700 kilometres \u2013 more than 3000 kilometres further than the 737 (the \u201cXLR\u201d in the A321\u2019s name stands for \u201cextra long range\u201d) \u2013 opening up more domestic and short-haul international routes for the airline, while taking pressure off existing crowded routes. While new international routes are yet to be confirmed for the A321XLR, Qantas domestic chief executive Markus Svensson said the extended range opened up the possibility of adding \u201cdestinations across South-East Asia and the Pacific Islands that are not viable with our current narrowbody fleet\u201d. Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson has previously indicated the aircraft will lead to an increase in routes to South-East Asia. Perth-India is also a possibility. The A321XLR increases seat capacity to 197 passengers. Five metres longer than its 737 predecessor, and with lower carbon emissions per seat, the new A321XLR can carry 197 passengers. It has 20 business class seats (up from 12) and 177 economy seats (up from 162), marking an overall 13 per cent increase in seat capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe additional capacity hasn\u2019t eaten into space between seats; economy remains unaffected, while business customers come out ahead with 66 per cent more legroom. Business class seats include wireless charging pads and an extendable cocktail table. Business class seats have a pitch of 37 inches (94 centimetres), with a recline of five inches (12.7 centimetres) and a six-way adjustable headrest, calf rest and footrest, with a 2-2 configuration. The seats feature reddish-brown leather covers, wireless charging pads and dual USB A and C charging ports, as well as an extendable cocktail table and in-arm tray table with built-in tablet holder. Economy seats are wider than those in the 737s at 17.6 inches (44.7 centimetres), up from 17 inches (43.2 centimetres), with a pitch of 30 inches (76.2 centimetres), in a 3-3 configuration. Seats feature extra cushioning, six-way leather adjustable headrests, drop-down device holders, adjustable meal tables and dual USB A and C charging ports. Economy seats are wider than those of the 737s at 17.6 inches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe redesigned seats incorporate new materials and a refreshed colour scheme, while the longer cabin\u2019s higher ceilings and larger windows invite more natural light, creating a brighter, more spacious feel. Virgin Australia\u2019s first Embraer 190-E2 aircraft touches down in Perth. While A321s flying domestic routes will not have seatback screens, Qantas has plans to configure 16 of the new aircraft with entertainment screens to service longer routes, including transcontinental flights from Perth, and short- and medium-haul international routes.

In more good news for domestic flyers, Virgin Australia took delivery of its first Embraer 190-E2 narrow-body jet earlier this month. The new aircraft will primarily service charter routes, while supporting regional routes in Western Australia from next month, including destinations like Darwin, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Port Hedland and Broome.
