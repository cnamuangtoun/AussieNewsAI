(Getty)\n\nWhile the grid used to be under the most pressure on winter nights, things have changed, according to the Grattan Institute's Alison Reeve.\n\n\"The winter evening peak in the old days was just everyone coming home and putting the heating on at the same time,\" she said.\n\n\"Now what it's shifting to is everyone putting the air conditioning on at the same time.\"\n\nAdding more pressure on the grid is an ironic issue with coal generation.\n\nIf it gets too hot, coal plants start to struggle.\n\nAluminium smelters are asked to shut down temporarily rather than cause blackouts elsewhere. (Nine Archives)\n\n\"Coal generators are more likely to break down because they don't cope very well with high heat,\" Reeve said.\n\n\"So when that happens, that can also cause a blackout or a brownout, because you've got such high demand at the same time.\"\n\nWhat is saving most Australians from blackouts is an arrangement with some of the country's biggest users of electricity .\n\nWhen the grid is under too much strain, the major users are asked to switch off.\n\nThe biggest offenders are aluminium smelters.\n\nAustralia has four aluminium smelters that account for 10 per cent of the electricity used in the country.\n\nAluminium smelters are the biggest user of electricity in Australia. (Nine Archives)\n\nThe Tomago smelter on the NSW Central Coast uses as much power as a city of a million people.\n\nAnd high power bills has meant the smelter is now turning to the federal government to keep them open.\ufeff\n\nBut switching them off is an expensive endeavour.\n\nThe smelters run 24 hours a day, and any shutdown is problematic.\n\n\"It doesn't happen that often,\" Reeve said.\n\n\"It's there if we need it.\"\n\nAluminium smelters like this one in Portland use a massive amount of electricity. (Nine Archives)\n\nAnd while rooftop solar panels are helpful for the grid on hot days, it is taking the edge off rather than carrying the load.\n\nSolar panels generate the most electricity around 1pm, but the usual peak time for power usage is about 5pm. By then, the sun has started to set and less electricity is being generated.\n\nSo how can the average punter reduce the risk of blackouts on a hot summer's day?\n\nThe best options are to add a few degrees to the air conditioner, and, obliquely enough, make sure your aluminium cans are getting recycled.\n\nREAD MORE: How each Australian state is doing when it comes to renewable energy",

(ABC News: Patrick Rocca)\n\nValued at more than $29 billion, the supermarket giant said higher energy, freight, labour, insurance and production costs were the key pressures to getting goods on shelves and selling them.\n\nWoolworths warned the ban would create a butterfly effect where shoppers would miss out on great deals, with the $36 billion public company saying it had delivered savings for consumers for seven quarters in a row.\n\n\"The law is unprecedented by targeting only two Australian-owned companies,\" a Woolworths spokesperson said, referring to it and its competitor Coles.\n\nThe retail giant said it would result in \"an uneven playing field which will see much larger, foreign-owned retailers free to charge customers whatever they want, without any of the new proposed restrictions\".\n\nThe Business Council of Australia also savaged the price gouging ban for being misplaced in its target.\n\n\"We all want lower prices for Australians, but regulation should be based on evidence,\" the council's CEO Bran Black said.\n\n\" If Australia wants lower prices and better outcomes for consumers, we need to focus on reducing unnecessary regulation and addressing the underlying cost pressures across supply chains. \"\n\nThe consumer watchdog's report found grocery prices rose at more than double the rate of wages between late 2022 and early 2023, attributing at least some of those rises to additional profits for Coles, Woolworths and Aldi.\n\nIn a statement, the Australian Retailers Association's chief executive Chris Rodwell said they \"strongly oppose\" the ban.\n\n\"These measures seek to address a problem for which there is no evidence and risk having the opposite effect \u2014 pushing grocery prices higher for Australian families,\" Mr Rodwell said.\n\nThe treasurer said the changes give the competition watchdog the powers it needs to hold supermarkets to account by policing the new regime.\n\n\"One of the best ways to ease the cost of living for Australians is to help people get fairer prices at the checkout and that's what this is all about,\" he said in a joint statement.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Virtual fencing has been legalised in New South Wales, with users of the technology already labelling it a \"lifesaver\".\n\nIt allows livestock to be moved or confined without the need for physical fences or gates.\n\nThe technology involves the use of a collar on livestock that sends out noises and an electric pulse if an animal leaves the designated area.\n\nFarmers can change the boundaries and check in on an animal's individual data on a mobile app.\n\nAngus McIntosh is a mixed farmer from Molong. (Supplied: Angus McIntosh)\n\nVirtual fencing is already legal in some other states, where farmers have credited it as a success.\n\nHowever, some in NSW remain undecided.\n\n\"I see the advantage of virtual fencing \u2026 but the maintenance of the collars, or the technology, how reliable they are \u2026 they're the real concerns,\" farmer Angus McIntosh said.\n\nAnd with the electronics reliant on telecommunication towers and satellites, some farmers have questioned how they will perform during emergencies.\n\nVirtual fences have been made legal in NSW. (ABC Rural: Emily Middleton)\n\nWhat is the cost?\n\nMr McIntosh currently operates roughly 2,000 sheep and 100 cows on just over 1,400 hectares of grazing land in Molong in the state's central west.\n\nHe has been thinking about using the technology, but is worried about the cost.\n\n\"On our level, it needs to be affordable to do a couple hundred head of cattle at a time, so the price point will be the deciding factor of how well it gets taken up,\" he said.\n\nCollars use solar panels to charge. (Supplied: Halter)\n\nIn addition to the collars, which can cost several hundred dollars per cow, towers are needed on properties for farmers to set up their virtual fences.\n\nLivestock researcher for the Kondinin Group, Pamela Lawson, said one provider's towers cost about $6,000 each.\n\n\"Which depends on the topography of your land and how many towers you're going to need,\" she said.\n\nThe systems are then controlled via an app, which is charged at about $2 to $2.50 per cow per month.\n\nHow does the technology work?\n\nDirector of strategic relations at virtual fence manufacturer Halter, Brent Thomas, described the technology as an \"Apple Watch for cows\".\n\nBrent Thomas says the collars can give farmers lots of useful information. (Supplied: Brent Thomas)\n\nHe said Halter's solar-powered collars monitored animals as well as controlled their movements.\n\n\"The [collars] can tell the farmer if there's any health problems or any kind of fertility indicators,\" he said.\n\nThe technology for Halter's collars involves the installation of a tower on the property that connects to the individual farmer's internet or telephone service, which provides a backup if there is a fault.\n\nVirtual fencing relies on the use of telecommunication technology such as satellite and service towers. (Supplied: Halter)\n\nMs Lawson said virtual fencing was already being used in about 23 per cent of Tasmania's dairy herd, but the take-up in the beef sector may be slower.\n\n\"It's just a bit more questionable about the sort of more broadacre general beef farmers on more extensive grazing country, how it will all work, given the amount of collars they will need and the area they are covering,\" Ms Lawson said.\n\nHowever, Mr Thomas said the fences were currently used on \"really big ranches\" in Montana and Texas.\n\n\"They're able to work on really large properties,\" he said.\n\nMember for Orange, Phil Donato, and Minister for Agriculture, Tara Moriarty. (ABC Rural: Emily Middleton)\n\nCost savings?\n\nTraditional fencing costs about $12,000 per kilometre, with an average farmer expected to install around two to three kilometres of fencing every year.\n\nThe set-up costs of virtual fencing will vary depending on the number of animals it is used for and the topography of a property; however, it's estimated that the first year's costs could be comparable to a farmer's annual fencing budget, with costs after that reducing significantly.\n\nOrange MP, Phil Donato, who has been pushing for virtual fencing to be legalised in NSW for five years, said farmers in other states have reported cost savings.\n\n\"I spoke to a farmer in Tasmania who's been using it \u2026 his fuel bill went from $1,000 to $100 a month because he's not driving around on a quad bike early in the morning,\" Mr Donato said.\n\n\"He's got more time to spend with his kids and his wife.\"\n\nEmergency performance\n\nWhen it comes to emergencies like bushfires and flooding, farmers have expressed concern over how the technology will hold up.\n\nMr Thomas said the collars were put to the test during severe storms in Tasmania last year.\n\nThe technology allows farmers to define boundaries without physical fences. (Supplied: Halter)\n\n\"Farmers were able to move their animals remotely without sending out staff and putting them in danger in the middle of the night,\" he said.\n\nNSW Farmers Association Animal Welfare Committee chair Robert McIntosh said while virtual fencing will be a \"game changer\" in emergencies, there would be a problem if the technology were reliant on just mobile phone signals due to poor connectivity in rural communities.\n\nHowever, a lot of the technology also uses satellite navigation.\n\n\"That's a lot more consistent and more reliable for farmers,\" he said.",

    "text": "Brett Lee has labelled Australia's current bowling attack the country's greatest ever, declaring Pat Cummins's men have now surpassed his group from the early 2000s.\n\nAustralia's attack will take one step closer to being reunited in Adelaide this week, with Cummins and Nathan Lyon back in the team alongside Mitchell Starc.\n\nJosh Hazlewood remains out, but Scott Boland has proven to be, arguably, the best back-up bowler in the game's history since his 2021 debut.\n\nCummins, Starc, Lyon and Hazlewood have now played 389 Tests between them and taken a total of 1,586 wickets.\n\nThree of the four have passed the 300-wicket milestone, while Hazlewood sits on 295 and will doubtless join them when he returns from injury.\n\nScott Boland (second right) is not a bad backup. (Getty Images: Cricket Australia/Morgan Hancock)\n\nOf the 35 Tests all four have played together, Australia have won 22, lost nine and drawn four.\n\nThe 567 wickets the quartet have taken in matches while playing in the same side is also a record.\n\nBoland is not included in those figures, but his 69 wickets at 18.17 means the Victorian still has the best Test average of any bowler in the past 90 years.\n\nAustralia's first-choice group from the early 2000s of Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie and Lee is usually considered the yardstick of great attacks.\n\nThey won 10 of 16 Tests they played together, and were a key part of Australia's dominance of world cricket with a combined 1,842 Test wickets.\n\nThe formidable golden era crop of bowlers will take some beating. (Getty Images: PA Images/Chris Young )\n\nBut Lee said he believed the current group had now usurped them.\n\n\"They're the best ever, I reckon,\" said Lee, who is in commentary for Kayo this summer.\n\n\"It's different eras, and hard to compare, but I would put them above us.\n\n\"If you look purely on stats, everyone has taken over 250 Test wickets, and that's never been done before.\n\n\"Scott Boland, if he is included in that, is a bit like Michael Kasprowicz, didn't really get an opportunity but a wonderful bowler.\n\n\"These guys are so good that the Australian public won't recognise how good they are until they're gone.\"\n\nTold of Lee's remarks ahead of the summer, Cummins pointed to the differences in the quartet as a key component to their strength.\n\n\"That's pretty awesome for him to say,\" Cummins said.\n\nPat Cummins will return in Adelaide after missing the first two Ashes Tests. (Getty Images: PA Images/Robbie Stephenson)\n\n\"We've been lucky we've all had our careers coincide with each other. I wouldn't have had anywhere near the career I have had alongside other guys.\n\n\"Those guys push me and are the best coaches.\n\n\"You have the control Nath brings. Starcy is different as a left-armer. Josh has the bounce and swing. It opens me up to be a bit more creative.\n\n\"It feels like we can really dovetail nicely into each other.\"\n\nAs Starc points out, comparing eras is hard.\n\nCricket changes from one generation to the next, and in the past five years pitches in Australia have become easier to bowl on.\n\nBut with that has also come finer margins, with Australia's current group regularly needing to either keep their side in a game or dig them out of a hole.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"Five or six years ago where Melbourne was a graveyard, that's changed completely now to being quite seamy,\" Starc said.\n\n\"Adelaide used to be flat, now it's often a pink-ball game and pretty even. We now play at [Perth Stadium] instead of the WACA, SCG you're not quite sure what you're getting.\n\n\"You just need to adapt as a team.\n\n\"But it's certainly not lost on us how special the group has been.\n\n\"It's very rare that you get four guys from the same state to have played so much together to the amount we have and have a fair bit of success along the way.\n\n\"Scotty has been a part of that group for a number of years now. We're very lucky.\"\n\nHow the attacks stack up\n\nGolden era:\n\nGlenn McGrath: 563 wickets at 21.64\n\nBrett Lee: 310 at 30.81\n\nJason Gillespie: 259 at 26.13\n\nShane Warne: 708 at 25.41\n\nTotal: 1,842 at 25.24\n\nCurrent era:\n\nPat Cummins: 309 wickets at 22.10\n\nMitchell Starc: 420 at 26.46\n\nJosh Hazlewood: 295 at 24.21\n\nNathan Lyon: 562 at 30.16\n\nTotal: 1,586 at 26.51\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Melbourne's West Gate Tunnel has officially opened to the public, with drivers traversing its path for the first time \u2014 for a fee.\n\nThe project was initially costed at $5.5 billion with just $400 million of taxpayer investment, but that has since blown out to $10.2 billion with the state chipping in $4.2 billion.\n\nThe twin tunnels have been designed to provide an alternative route for freight trucks travelling through the city's west to the Port of Melbourne, reduce travel time for commuters and traffic on the West Gate Bridge, while also improving bike paths to enable cyclists to travel more safely into the city.\n\nThe road tunnel's opening comes a fortnight after the opening of the Metro Tunnel rail project drew thousands of curious first-time passengers.\n\n\"It's going to be a massive game-changer for the way people travel around this great city and state,\" Premier Jacinta Allan said.\n\n\"It means families can get home sooner, congestion will be slashed and most importantly too, for residents here in the western suburbs, it'll get trucks off local roads because they'll have that much-talked-about, long-needed alternative to the West Gate Bridge through the West Gate Tunnel, providing direct access to the Port of Melbourne.\"\n\nThe West Gate Tunnel opened in the early hours of Sunday morning. (Supplied: Victorian Infrastructure Delivery Authority)\n\nThe twin tunnels opened to travellers while most Victorians were sleeping, with the outbound tunnel opening at 12:10am, the inbound route at 2:15am and the Wurundjeri Way extension at 2:45am.\n\nTolls for the tunnel will be $6.54 for cars using the city exit during the morning peak \u2014 from 7am-9am on weekdays \u2014 and just over $4 to access other parts of the tunnel, and at off-peak times. Motorcylists will be charged less, while those driving light-heavy vehicles will be charged up to $10.47 per trip.\n\nThroughout January, the tunnel will be free for all drivers on weekends.\n\nMelburnians had the chance to walk through parts of the tunnel in November. (ABC News: Leanne Wong)\n\nAs well as cost overruns and the project overshooting its estimated completion date by three years, issues such as how and where to dispose of contaminated soil have also been sources of angst.\n\nThe premier defended the project running over budget.\n\n\"These are big and complex projects and they do come \u2026 along the journey, with some additional challenges and I will acknowledge with the delivery of the West Gate Tunnel project there were some additional challenges that came along as we were getting in and delivering the project,\" Ms Allan said.\n\n\"But ultimately we had a choice to make. Do you get on, address the challenges, roll up your sleeves and do the hard work, or do you turn away from these projects like the Liberal Party would have you do?\"\n\nEarly in 2018, the opposition and the Greens teamed up to temporarily revoke the project's planning approval, but months later the Liberals pledged support for building the West Gate Tunnel.\n\nA map showing the West Gate Tunnel project, which is officially open. (Supplied: Victoria's Big Build)\n\nWestern suburbs residents welcome 'better health'\n\nThe opening of the tunnel will see 9,000 fewer trucks on western suburbs roads daily, according to the state government.\n\nIn some areas, there will be zones where freight trucks are banned around the clock, while curfews will apply on key arterial routes in the west, including Williamstown Road.\n\nMartin Wurt, from community group the Maribyrnong Truck Action Group, which has long campaigned for measures to reduce the number of trucks travelling through residential areas in the western suburbs, said the tunnel would help improve living standards.\n\nHe said residents in the area were \"heavily impacted\" by air pollution.\n\n\"To get these trucks off our streets, away from our schools, away from our kindergartens, away from our shops, hopefully is going to lead to a better health outcome,\" Mr Wurt said.",

(Supplied: T100)\n\nAfter the race, Gentle posted that she would not have been happy with the performance at the start of the year, but was understandably \"walking away proud\" of her efforts.\n\n\"Inspired by so many women around me.

I also hope that one day I'll have the privilege of becoming a mum.\"",

    "text": "Attorney-General Michelle Rowland has been told to repay some of the expenses she claimed for a week-long family trip to Perth, after the independent watchdog found the spending was outside the official guidelines.\n\nMs Rowland referred the expenses to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (IPEA) last week, after the Australian Financial Review reported she had billed taxpayers more than $21,000 for the trip in 2023, including $16,050 in flights for her family.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Ms Rowland's office confirmed she would be repaying a \"portion\" of the trip following IPEA's advice.\n\n\"IPEA finalised its advice on Friday 12 December and conveyed a portion of the family reunion travel expenses were outside the guidelines,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The attorney-general has formally accepted that advice on Friday and commenced steps to make a repayment.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the attorney-general had at least 10 official engagements during her week in Perth and on days with no official duties, it is understood Ms Rowland covered her own expenses and accommodation.\n\nExpenses scrutiny grows\n\nMs Rowland's cabinet colleagues were defending her on Sunday, with Transport Minister Catherine King rejecting suggestions the nation's chief law officer should resign.\n\n\"No, I do not think Michelle Rowland needs to resign,\" Ms King told reporters.\n\n\"I think Michelle has done exactly what she should do, she's referred her use of expenditure to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority \u2026 and she's paying the money back.\n\n\"Members are accountable for the decisions they make.\"\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers also backed the attorney-general while acknowledging the \"substantial community concerns\" that have arisen about the use of travel entitlements.\n\n\"I think it's appropriate that colleagues have sought assurances from the independent body that these claims are within the rules. I'm confident that they are,\" he said.\n\n\"It's also appropriate that the prime minister has asked the organisation, at arm's length from the government, for advice on any changes which may be necessary.\"\n\nThe attorney-general is the second politician in the past week to have referred themselves to IPEA after Communications Minister Anika Wells, who sparked the travel expenses furore when it was revealed she had billed taxpayers nearly $100,000 for last-minute flights to New York to spruik the government's teen social media ban.\n\nAnika Wells has also referred her travel spending for review. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nFurther scrutiny of her expenses found Ms Wells, as sports minister, had also spent thousands of dollars flying her family to Thredbo's ski resort, where she was attending a work event, and flying her husband to major sporting events including AFL Grand Finals, Boxing Day Test matches and the Formula 1 Grand Prix.\n\nMs Wells insists her spending is within the rules but referred herself to IPEA \"for the avoidance of doubt\".\n\nAfter initially dismissing calls for the rules to be tightened, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has now asked IPEA to review whether the taxpayer-funded perks, including generous family reunion entitlements, should change.\n\nWhen can politicians charge the 'company card'? A spotlight on sports minister Anika Wells prompts fresh scrutiny of the rules about the expenses politicians can claim, including to attend big-ticket sporting events and concerts.\n\nParliamentarians are entitled to claim expenses for some family travel, including three Australia-wide business class return flights to where the politician is working and travel to Canberra from their home up to the value of nine return business class flights per year.\n\nMinisters Wells and Rowland are not the only politicians to have taken advantage of the entitlement, with an ABC investigation revealing MPs had spent more than $1.1 million under the family reunion provisions last financial year.\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell topped the list of spending, at $48,178, with WA Senator Fatima Payman and Nationals MP Andrew Willcox not far behind.\n\nOpposition Leader Sussan Ley has repeatedly said she was open to \"looking at the rules\" and has written to Mr Albanese requesting a meeting to discuss how trust in the system can be strengthened, \"so community expectations are being met\".\n\nThe expenses authority is responsible for monitoring compliance with the rules and can make recommendations when it audits politicians, but the guidelines themselves are set by regulation, administered by the finance minister and special minister of state.",

(ABC News: Lily Nothling)\n\n\"Those older suburbs with trees that have been around for 80 to over 100 years, a lot of those trees are reaching the end of their useful life and some are starting to be removed and replaced,\" Ms Dawes said.\n\n\"You also have the urban densification program that is really looking to see more housing in the inner-city areas, so we're not continuing to push out into greenfield sites.\"\n\nMs Dawes said it was \"difficult\" to forecast whether the ACT would meet its tree canopy target by 2045, but said she expected to see greener results in 2030.\n\nCalls for a plan\n\nWhile tree coverage on leased land has dropped from 21 to 19 per cent over the past five years, it has increased on public land from 23 to 24 per cent.\n\nThe ACT Greens have called for the government to outline a plan to achieve its 30 per cent tree canopy goal.\n\nThe ACT government plans to have 30 per cent of the urban environment covered by a tree canopy by 2045. (ABC News: Toby Hunt)\n\n\"It needs to demonstrate that it is investing in our urban forest through planting, maintenance and protecting the existing trees so that we're actually able to achieve the target the government has set for itself,\" Mr Braddock said.\n\nBut not all Canberrans want trees outside their homes.\n\nThe government's tree planting program faced almost 550 rejections last financial year, with residents on narrow streets or smaller blocks prioritising parking space over shade.\n\n\"We know that it's better to have a very shaded city to make it the most liveable place for us,\" Ms Dawes said,",

(ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nThe recipes were passed down from his dad, so Chris's younger brother Peter noticed when they didn't taste quite right.\n\nHe said it took a little while for the family to realise, but ultimately Chris was diagnosed with dementia.\n\n\"We sort of didn't realise it was happening until just things weren't quite right,\" Peter said.\n\n\"We had a few rough years; we had our mother and sister die within a month of each other,\" Peter said.\n\n\"Chris started forgetting to come down to the bakery some days.\"\n\nChris Tilse has worked in bakeries most of his life.

(ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\n\"There's a bit of family pride to uphold for sure, and to try and help Chris feel like he belonged to something so he could anchor to something and feel like himself again,\" he said.\n\nIt is a positive outcome for the town of about 500 people, which has struggled through a loss of industry and population.\n\nRuns in the family\n\nPeter says baking now runs in the family's blood, but the craft came about from hardship.\n\n\"Our family got into baking through tragedy,\" he said.\n\nIn 1945, his aunt was married to the baker in Mareeba, far north Queensland.\n\nSnow's has been on smoko. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\n\"She got run over by a US army truck \u2026 her husband's family had the bakery, and it went pear-shaped for them, so Dad's older brothers took it over,\" Peter said.\n\n\"Dad got into the trade that way.\"\n\nEventually Chris and Peter's dad, Monty Tilse, ended up in Alpha and opened a bakery.\n\nThere are lots of memories inside Snow's bakery for brothers Chris and Peter. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nSnow's Pies, came from his nickname, Snow, because of his white hair as a young lad.\n\nIn 1976, when Chris was 18, the bakery burnt down.\n\nWith no money to rebuild, Chris went off to work in bakeries around Queensland.\n\nIn the early 90s, he returned to Alpha and bought a building to continue his father's legacy.\n\n\"I've got lots of recipes,\" Chris said.\n\n\"We made a lot of pies here, at least 100 every day, probably more, maybe 400 some days.\"\n\nOpen for business\n\nPeter also runs an entertainment venue, which he calls an old-time music and food hall, on the main street of Alpha.\n\nHe has been selling the bakery's goods from there, but is hoping to have the bakery storefront running by Easter next year.\n\nSnow's is loved for its pies and bakery treats. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\n\"My sister is going to be moving on in a month or two and that leaves the two of us here to keep things afloat,\" Peter said.\n\nThe brothers hope Snow's Pies will take off again thanks to tourists passing through the town in the busy season.\n\n\"It's one of those things you'll meet somebody from anywhere in Australia and they'll say, 'Oh Alpha, have you been to the bakery there?'\" Peter said.\n\n\"Dad obviously was known for making very good pies and those things were passed down to Chris and I kept one eye open while they were doing it.\n\n\"If someone tells you the bakery is shut, well, you can tell them otherwise.\"",

    "text": "MUSIC\n\nSydney Philharmonia Choirs \u2013 Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio\n\nOpera House, December 13\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio is replete with musical glories but presents a quandary for modern performance. Bach wrote the work as six cantatas for performance on separate Christmas Feast days, a mode of presentation which is only meaningful in a liturgical context. Yet the modern habit of presenting all six cantatas one after another creates a longish concert and sometimes dampens the concentrated focus that each deserves. The Philharmonia\u2019s solution of splitting the oratorio over two separate Christmas seasons (2023 and 2025) and separating the cantatas with new Australian works was effective. After Deborah Cheetham Fraillon and Matthew Doyle\u2019s Acknowledgement of Country, Tarimi Nulay \u2013 Long Time Living Here, conductor Elizabeth Scott led the opening chorus of Part IV, Fallt mit Danken, fallt mit Loben in a tempo of lilting complacency (using that word as Jane Austen did, rather than as a derogatory term). Tenor John Longmuir, who took the narrative role of the Evangelist, brought a sense of drama and robust strength to the part, opening out splendidly in Part VI, without making the role operatic. Baritone Christopher Richardson sang the recitatives with Chorale Immanuel, o susses Wort! and Wohlan dein Name with rounded pure vowels giving his tone an aura of poised dignity.\n\nIn the echo aria, Flosst, mein Heiland, soprano Jacqueline Porter projected a richly coloured, discreetly thrilling sound, blending with oboist Alexandre Oguey and organist David Drury to create refined chamber music, while the two \u2018echo\u2019 musicians, soprano Briar Babington and oboist Eve Osborn contributed distant imitations from behind the choir. Soprano Jacqueline Porter. Concertmaster Fiona Ziegler and sister Leone Ziegler played the concerto-like violin solos in Longmuir\u2019s aria Ich will nur dir zu Ehren leben with persuasive rhythmic fluency. A characteristic of Part IV is the addition of French horns in the outer movements, which bathed the clear sound of the Philharmonia Chamber Singers in burnished warmth for the final chorale. Following this, Australian composer Phillip Cullen used Kipling\u2019s poetry and quotations from Bach\u2019s Part V for his new choral work A Nativity. With smoothly finished phrases and well-wrought traditional harmony, it began with a mournful plaint on cor anglais and ended with the choral lines haloed in high harmonics from solo violin. Scott\u2019s leadership in the opening chorus of Part V was livelier than Part IV and drew neat articulation from chorus and orchestra and fluid rhythmic sprightliness from the pair of oboes that create Part V\u2019s characteristic sound. Contralto Hannah Fraser sang the recitative with chorus, Wo ist der neugeborene Konig der Juden with wonderfully rounded pure sound.\n\nA highlight of the entire concert was the intimate musical interaction of the aria Terzetto Ach, wenn wird die Zeit erscheinen. Here Longmuir and Porter created brightly edged excitement alongside Fiona Ziegler\u2019s animated violin figuration, while Fraser soothed the music with a warm admonitory phrase \u201cbe silent, he is already here\u201d. A Prayer of Jesus by Australian composer Kayla Erin Hinton began the second half, articulating declamatory phrases accompanied by orchestration of confident radiance. Part VI, with its outer choruses laced with trumpet solos from Anthony Heinrichs, brought the concert\u2019s choral highlights, the Philharmonia Chamber Singers articulating with energised rhythmic fluidity. The work ends with the so-called \u2018Passion chorale\u2019 set with elaboration instrumentation and exultant trumpet figuration. The Philharmonia followed this with a reprise of the opening chorus of Part 1, which, though a masterpiece, was unnecessary here. The actual close, a true Bachian ending, expresses collective joy through masterly musical detail and symbolism, and says all that needs to be said. THEATRE\n\nIRVING BERLIN\u2019S HOLIDAY INN\n\nRiverside Theatres Parramatta, December 6\n\nUntil December 14\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn the 1940s, the legendary Irving Berlin (who was, ironically, Jewish) dreamt of a little number called White Christmas. At Riverside Theatres, audiences dreamt of a Christmas that doesn\u2019t sweat their entrails out, while being razzle-dazzled to distraction by the stage adaptation of Holiday Inn, a two-hour affair featuring a live band, a dizzying array of sparkle-heavy costumes, old-world charm and some vigorously inventive original choreography by Veronica Beattie George.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen a tap-dancing ensemble perform synchronised jump-rope with green tinsel, are you even in the silly season? The show features a dizzying array of sparkle-heavy costumes. Credit: Robert Catto Holiday Inn is the film that launched the world\u2019s best-selling single, which also starred musical history\u2019s most dapper dynamic duo: Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby. Filling those enormous singin\u2019 and dancin\u2019 shoes just fine in this Well Done Creative production are Rob Mallet as Jim Hardy and Max Patterson as Ted Hanover \u2013 showbiz characters whose long friendship is put to the test when Jim\u2019s domestic impulses and anxious sentimentality clash with Ted\u2019s big-time ambitions. To put it another way: narrative conflict, thy name is woman. First it\u2019s Lila (Pamela Renouf is a sensation and a hoot as the squawking, mega-talented, self-obsessed starlet). Then it\u2019s Linda Mason, (Mary McCorry, of classically beautiful looks and ravishing vocals), an independent-minded schoolteacher who sold Jim the Mason farm in Connecticut, where he hopes to start a new chapter away from the insanity of \u201cthe lifestyle\u201d. Getting festive: Matt Hourigan and Max Patterson. Credit: Robert Catto\n\nLife in the country bumpkin seat, however, turns out to be laborious, lonesome and financially challenging. With some sneaky manoeuvring from plucky farmhand Louise (Paige Fallu), he and his New York friends cook up a creative money-making ruse: to transform the property into a \u201cHoliday Inn\u201d, hosting extravagant ticketed shows (also charging guests for board) only on holidays. Cue Shaking the Blues Away! Loading There are some interesting (and essential) variations from the film. No blackface is one. There are also significant differences in narrative structure and character motivations (with Ted spared the moral grubbiness of \u201cstealing the girl\u201d romantically). Some songs are shuffled about to take on new meaning (a memorable moment comes when the otherwise silent drummer pipes up with his Cinderella plea to Ted: \u201cI\u2019m easy to dance with!\u201d), with the best comic moments still when Jim lets jealousy undermine his own show. As with so many crowd-pleasing productions, this one would benefit from being more snappy, with less stuffing. Some added Berlin hits feel interstitial, and the invigorating theatrical bombast under director Sally Dashwood loses a little pizzazz in the second half. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a lot to be enjoyed, particularly given the robust technical skills of the actors, which are geared for delight and well-balanced with their acting chops. There\u2019s a worthy takeaway, too, about freedom and autonomy. A line from French poet Guillaume Apollinaire that bookends the show reminds us what holidays are all about: \u201cNow and then, it\u2019s good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.\u201d\n\nMUSIC\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nAllianz Stadium, December 10\n\nReviewed by BERNARD ZUEL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Kendrick Lamar doesn\u2019t exactly want to be a pop star, but he doesn\u2019t not want to be one either. Take the flames left and right and two huge screens, the sparkly-framed glasses and a posse of dancers, the giant furry dice with scented tree ornament and the scaled-up stairs on an otherwise bare stage, the crack of fireworks like cannons and a whispered start with Lamar muttering in the shadows backstage, and the powerful, crisp, clear and just-short-of-overwhelming sound. All point to production values of a mega-pop show. All simple but effective manipulations of an environment effectively inhabited by only one non-dancing, rarely-speaking, charismatic but undemonstrative man.\n\nBut then what is King Kunta but a knee-cracking pop song? Even, or maybe especially in, this condensed version, followed with the skittish, swirling cinematic noir of Element. How many hooks are as elemental as Squabble Up\u2019s bare-bones lean/shuffle, brought to life by those dancers and given voice by the whole stadium, or the brass-bolstered TV Off, split into two parts, an hour apart? How many stiff-legged grooves are as welcome to people who can\u2019t necessarily dance but can strut in their seats as that offered in Humble? Kendrick Lamar doesn\u2019t want to be some generational spokesman, but he doesn\u2019t not want to be one either. Sure, the lubricious Poetic Justice was primarily focused on matters horizontal but the same territory in the old-school soul groove of Dodger Blue was laced with unceremonial frankness, and Good Credit crept into darker corners. M.A.A.D City peeled back urban sheets and showed how everything runs on tension, and within the folding-in-on-itself progressive bass and counterweight keyboards of Reincarnated was a dense story that was always racing away with his delivery but still landed punch after punch about being that very modern creature, the uncertain adult in a childlike world. Speaking of which, one thing Lamar very much does want to be is Drake Disser-in-Chief. Still. See both the shot early in the show, Euphoria, and the stronger chaser to close the set, Not Like Us. Kendrick, that man is down, boxed up and posted already.\n\nWhile his voice is the lowest profile of the on-stage sounds, that\u2019s ultimately irrelevant. If you don\u2019t already know each word of these songs you aren\u2019t serious and you aren\u2019t meant to be here. Kendrick Lamar doesn\u2019t want to be exclusive, but he doesn\u2019t not want to either. Got a problem with that? To borrow from the man, \u201cPut the Bible down and go eye for an eye for it.\u201d Kendrick Lamar plays Allianz Stadium tonight (December 11) and the Spilt Milk Festival in Canberra on December 13 and Gold Coast on December 14. MUSIC\n\nSOMBR\n\nHordern Pavilion, December 9\n\nReviewed by MILLIE MUROI\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 For a young artist whose fame started with a viral song on TikTok just three years ago, Sombr is surprisingly smooth and unfazed on stage.\n\nOn his first Australian tour, the 20-year-old American singer could easily have you believe he is a seasoned pro (apart from a few too many disingenuous \u201cI-love-yous\u201d when he should be getting on with the show). The setlist begins on the front foot, running through songs from Saviour, showcasing his richer, deeper tones, to We Never Dated, which drifts into an ethereal falsetto. Sombr performs during the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards. Credit: Getty Images for MTV His range is impressive and, while he may not have an especially powerful voice, he has enough to make an impact as required. Technically, he is consistent and controlled while imbuing all of his songs with that characteristic teenage angst. The show is prety much bare bones - one man and a band with basic production. But it\u2019s done well.\n\nAnd while it does drift at points in the second half, the setlist is not long enough to make it tedious. It\u2019s also a comfortable sort of dip: one that still has you swaying to the music and enjoying the atmosphere. Sombre\u2019s has some similarities to the work of The 1975\u2019s frontman Matty Healy. Their songs share stylistic and thematic similarities and during numbers such I Wish I Knew How to Quit You and Do I Ever Cross Your Mind, the tortured poet bearing seem familiar. Sombr is, however, a bit softer and more palatable than Healy. Caroline - the song Sombr wrote when he was 16 and which catapulted him to fame - and Perfume, are tender, heartfelt and delivered with precision but also a mesmerising sweetness. And while most of his lyrics are despondent, devastating or dark, there are bouncy beats, catchy bass segments and playful riffs that keep the energy high. He also finishes strong with funky songs such as 12 to 12 and his biggest hit: Back to Friends. It may not be a concert for the ages, but it\u2019s a seamless show with solid fundamentals.\n\nTHEATRE\n\nBEAUTIFUL THING\n\nQtopia Sydney, December 5\n\nUntil December 13\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd It\u2019s a seasonally fitting, welcome thing to hear happy squeals and warm laughter in response to a queer drama told on stage. Often (unless it\u2019s part cabaret), the audience\u2019s reaction is grim, choked silence \u2013 trauma the legitimate yet scarifying seam from which a lot of LGBT+ stories are mined. Allowing a gay \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d love story to have a relatively untroubled trajectory and happy ending was what made Liverpudlian dramatist Jonathan Harvey want to write Beautiful Thing. Opening in London in 1993, it went on to win a John Whiting Award, was adapted into a popular film, and had its Australian premiere at the 1998 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. This CODA production brings it back with a uniformly excellent cast, with Finn Stannard making an impressive directorial debut to close Qtopia\u2019s 2025 program.\n\nJamie (Jake Walker) and Ste (Max Dykstra). Credit: Yingying Zhang Harvey would go on to write for Coronation Street for two decades and counting, and there\u2019s a lot of this and other British soaps\u2019 recognisable tones and touchpoints here: a character-driven plot and working-class realism; young and old battling a hard-luck system with whatever\u2019s at hand (in this story, the music of Mama Cass); a matter-of-factness about the realities they\u2019re up against; violence acknowledged if not given too-graphic treatment; neighbours getting all up in each other\u2019s business; and animated dialogue that plumbs its humour from cheek, colourful patois and bluntness. Willa King as tough-love mum and worn-down barwoman Sandra steals the show on that last one (though her relentless shaming of heroically impudent expelled schoolgirl Leah as \u201cslag\u201d might be a bit dated). Set in a South London council estate, an environment summed up by three sky-blue doors on a grey tenement wall, the \u201cbeautiful thing\u201d in question is the tender relationship that forms between Hello! magazine-reading Jamie (Jake Walker) and much more athletic Ste (Max Dykstra), which begins when Ste takes refuge from an abusive father in his neighbour\u2019s bedroom. It\u2019s also how frowsy queen Sandra, her new boyfriend Tony (Michael Hogg) and \u201clost cause\u201d Leah (Poppy Cozens) react. It\u2019s not a big spoiler to say: pretty well! When Tony, a stand-in father figure, wraps trembling Jamie in a bear hug and says with a smiling reassurance \u201cit\u2019s OK\u201d after the boy comes out to his mum, a widespread corneal leakage event was seen in the audience.",

To provide point to point transportation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Vertical Aerospace's chief engineer David King, laying out the company's ambitious vision behind its impressive prototype.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Valo is just one version of what's called an Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft - or evTOL.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the name suggests, and a promotional video shows, it has the ability to take off vertically like a helicopter, but without the noise and pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in the industry, like Mr King, believe it could be the taxi of the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One thing is now slower than it was ten years ago, 30 years ago, 50 years ago, and that's mobility. Mobility in and around populated areas just hasn't kept up. And the solution to that is to unlock the third dimension, it's air mobility, and to be able to provide that to the masses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Valo boasts luxury seating for up to six passengers and speeds of 240 kilometres an hour over distances up to 160 kilometres.\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Aerospace test pilot Simon Davies says, it's a breeze to drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Really it is super simple. You push forward on this lever. It makes you go forward. You pull back on the control stick. It makes you go up. And you just point using the tools you've got and looking out the window. And the aircraft works out how to make it all happen for you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority CASA says it expects to see passenger transport services, or air taxis, up and running in urban areas between 2027 and 2029.\n\n\n\n\n\nClem Newton-Brown is the CEO of Skyportz, a Melbourne-based company that's developed a patented landing surface for electric air taxis that helps address practical concerns like noise and safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the era of air taxi travel is on its way, but the complex infrastructure and regulation required is still catching up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an evolution of the helicopter, which only becomes the revolution that they're talking about when there's a multitude of new landing sites, places such as shopping centers and offices and tourism destinations, things like that. And the problem with that is that landing aircraft in tighter urban locations produces a whole lot of issues around safety and amenity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also scepticism from some about the commercial viability of the air taxi industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Aboulafia, from AeroDynamic Advisory, says it's a competitive market with limited funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know I want to live in a world where I can fly helicopters everywhere. I think most of society would check that box and say: 'Absolutely, get me above that traffic, get me there fast.' Unfortunately, the economics of flying vertically have been about the same for a really long time. And while Vertical has produced an interesting machine, a lot of impressive work going into it, the economics are about the same, maybe a little worse - we don't know - than flying in a helicopter. So it's the same challenges from a business perspective.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Aerospace, who has already received some 1,500 orders for its new Valo aircraft, is not deterred by the challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkyportz CEO Clem Newton-Brown says China and the Middle East are moving rapidly on regulating air spaces for the growing industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says while many aircraft will fail to get to market, developers at the forefront will soon make an impact.\n\n\n\n",

Tickets are now unavailable until the end of March 2026, with April bookings yet to be released.\n\n\n\nMelbourne resident Lisa Andrews said she had only just managed to secure her spots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I saw it come up on Facebook, and I logged straight in, and I booked three tickets straight away, and then I was telling friends, and I went back on, and there was nothing available,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nFrustration over advance ticketing\n\nSBS News spoke to local residents and tourists at St Kilda Pier to gather their views on the new ticketing system.\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Kilda local Rhianna, who was visiting the pier with her family from the United Kingdom, said she was unable to secure tickets through what she described as a \"convoluted\" system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a bit confusing and it wasn't exactly clear when you could see what was available next,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nItalian tourist Gabriele Tuccillo, in Melbourne on a working holiday visa, also had no tickets and said the booking system is \"weird\" for allowing reservations so far in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What if I actually did book it in March? And then at some point, you know, I'm not going to be in Melbourne,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSt Kilda's penguin viewing ticketing system has drawn criticism as visitors struggle to secure spots. Source: SBS News Cambodian international student Bon shared similar concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think six months in advance is a good time frame. Maybe a week or a month is probably better,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe St Kilda penguins have faced many issues over the year, including flash photography, selfie sticks, overcrowding and even physical attacks.\n\n\n\nWhy St Kilda's penguin viewing now requires tickets\n\nThe St Kilda penguins have long faced issues such as flash photography, selfie sticks, overcrowding and even physical attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal volunteer group Earthcare St Kilda has protected and researched the penguin colony since 1982, providing volunteer guides for daily viewings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group's vice president, Flossy Sperring, said they once dealt with crowds of up to 2,000 people, prompting them to request a dedicated viewing platform from Parks Victoria, a state government agency responsible for managing public land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People were sticking their selfie sticks into penguin nests, and back then people were allowed all over these rocks as well,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were just people literally everywhere as penguins were coming up; there would just be people sitting on the rocks in front of their nests.\"\n\n\n\nThe penguins at St Kilda pier have long been a popular tourist attraction. Source: Supplied / Phillip Island Nature Parks The viewing platform was eventually built as part of the Victorian government's St Kilda Pier redevelopment. Because the platform has limited capacity, a ticketing system was introduced when the penguin colony reopened in October.\n\n\n\n\n\nSperring said Earthcare had initially hoped to help manage the penguin experience alongside Parks Victoria after the renovations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had hoped that we would be able to manage the penguin viewing experience, because we have an understanding of what locals want,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPhillip Island Nature Parks responds to ticketing backlash\n\nHowever, the two-year ticketing contract was instead awarded to Phillip Island Nature Parks, the conservation organisation behind the Phillip Island Penguin Parade, where tickets cost $33 each.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the four years St Kilda's colony was closed for renovations, Phillip Island became the nearest place for visitors to see little penguins in the wild.\n\n\n\nPhillip Island Nature Parks has responded to criticism of the ticketing system.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Anderson, general manager of tourism at Nature Parks, told SBS News, \"We had an overwhelming response for tickets in the first release\", which \"unfortunately meant that some people have missed out\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We plan to start releasing tickets more regularly in the new year, with a shorter booking window, and we are currently looking at ways to give priority access to local residents,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil these changes take effect, Nature Parks said visitors can either wait for the next ticket release or attempt to secure earlier tickets that may become available through cancellations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Sperring noted there is little incentive for people to cancel free tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it's free, what's happening is a lot of people aren't actually showing up, and so we're not at full capacity,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, it would be really great if people could actually come in as walk-ins, if it's not busy.\"\n\n\n\nTickets for the penguin viewing experience at Melbourne's St Kilda Pier are now unavailable until the end of March 2026, with April bookings yet to be released. Source: SBS News Anderson said Phillip Island Nature Parks sends reminder emails urging visitors to cancel their tickets if they can no longer attend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We encourage people to cancel early if their plans change so they can be re-booked,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Sperring said people are \"a little bit annoyed\" they cannot cancel tickets online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They [ticketholders] have to phone Phillip Island to cancel up, and I think that means that a lot of people aren't doing that, and so then we're ending up with the boardwalk not being at full capacity,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite booking tickets online, ticketholders must call or email Phillip Island Nature Parks directly to cancel. The organisation said online cancellations are coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News observed some walk-in visitors were able to access the boardwalk when space allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnderson confirmed there is \"some availability for walk-ins if numbers allow\".\n\n\n\nSBS News observed some walk-in visitors were able to access the boardwalk when space allowed. Source: SBS News To test how workable walk-ins really are, SBS News tried to enter the earlier session on two separate nights with similar weather, but was unable to get in.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the third attempt, Phillip Island Nature Parks staff told us that tickets had become available, which could then be booked online at the gate.\n\n\n\nWill St Kilda penguin viewing experience stay free?\n\nPenguin viewing at St Kilda Pier has always been free.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the pier reopened in October, plans to introduce a $24 ticket fee were scrapped following public backlash.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked whether the St Kilda Penguin Viewing Experience will be \"free forever\", Phillip Island Nature Parks CEO Catherine Basterfield could not confirm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not in a place to answer that one, but it's free now,\" she said on ABC Radio Melbourne in October.\n\n\n\n",

When you hand a child a wheelchair, it just takes my breath away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former cabinet maker first devised the plan to make and donate wheelchairs, after a trip to Fiji in 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I couldn't believe what the children there were going through without a wheelchair. And one of them that really sticks to my mind is a 14-year-old girl walking around on her hands. We've said, what are you going to do now? And she said, I'm going to town. I've never been to town.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 30 years later Mr La Rance\u2019s project still mass produces robust wheelchairs from dumped and unwanted bicycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The bicycles come in, they get cut up and machined to what we want and then they're all passed down through the line with spray painting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there\u2019s no shortage of raw materials - with estimates up to half-a-million bicycles are discarded every year. Most end up in landfill. At the Surfers Sunrise Wheelchair Trust, skilled volunteers have turned out almost 12,000 wheelchairs, so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've delivered them to 31 different countries all over Asia, Africa, you name it, we've been there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest shipment is bound for Sri Lanka, where catastrophic flooding creates extra hardship for people with limited mobility. Valluvan Thillairajah is a medical student and volunteer with Australian-based charity Vanni Hope, and currently delivering aid to flood victims there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With people who don't have mobility, they're literally unable to get away from it. And a lot of them unfortunately dying and being caught in the destruction, which is yeah really tough.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith many roads and paths destroyed in Sri Lanka, Mr Thillairajah says the generous gift of 121 wide-tyre wheelchairs is most welcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're rough terrain wheelchairs, which are really useful for us because especially in regions like the upcountry, you have to go uphill to get places.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Trust chairman and Gold Coast local Geoff Croad it\u2019s also about keeping unwanted bikes out of landfill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was one building in Surfers [Paradise] that had like 40 to 50 bikes sitting in the basement. So, we're able to pick up 30 this morning, bring them back to the depot. We've probably put through the facility probably 40,000 bikes over the years. We use the back frame of the bike. We need two of those, two matching frames to form the basic wheelchair.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design is so popular, Mr La Rance says the Rotary Club charity is swamped with orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We just keep the containers rolling out. We've got people all over the world wanting these wheelchairs, so we're never going to fulfil the requests that are out there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThree decades and thousands of chairs later, Mr La Rance can hardly believe the impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, I never imagined that at all. You\u2019d need to experience the effect it has on a person er that never been able to walk. You give them a wheelchair and wheel them to wherever they want to go. So, it combines the family back together again as well.\"\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied Paul Griffin, an infectious disease physician and clinical microbiologist from the University of Queensland, said: \"I think it's an incredibly valuable service he's provided.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more, Honey does it all for free in his spare time.\n\n\n\nLooking at the big picture\n\nSoft-spoken and polite, Honey sat down with SBS News to talk about how he became scientists' go-to for COVID-19 information.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explained that being from Melbourne's north-west suburbs meant he lived in one of the first places in Australia to be hit by lockdowns.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an IT specialist stuck at home, he realised it was hard to get information about national case numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the states have a decent report that comes out ... but they are just for that state. There's nothing at the federal level,\" Honey said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo he built a spreadsheet that brought all the case numbers from across the country together in one spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, he posted it online \u2014 first on GitHub, an open-source code-sharing platform, and then \"pretty much everywhere\".\n\n\n\nThe graph shows estimated current COVID-19 case numbers across the country based on cases among aged care staff. Source: Supplied National case numbers aren't the only ones he keeps track of. He also monitors variants , vaccine uptake, and aged care case numbers, and posts case charts for New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't long before epidemiologists started to take notice.\n\n\n\nAn 'incredibly valuable service'\n\nAdrian Esterman, professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, said during the pandemic he was asked to give talks to concerned community groups about variants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe struggled to find enough detail from state health departments to satisfy his audience's questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then I came across a Tweet from Mike that led to his GitHub site, which provided exactly the information I was looking for,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHoney's variant tracker takes publicly available information on cases of people infected with COVID-19 mutations and brings it all together on a world map.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat way, it's much easier to see which variants are growing and where, compared to pages of text on sites like the World Health Organization's COVID-19 variants dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I still give talks on COVID-19, and Mike's is still the go-to website,\" Esterman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nProminent American cardiologist Eric Topol, who founded the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, told SBS News that Honey's work is a \"remarkable source\" of information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"His diligence, strive for accuracy, and thoughtful sharing of data have been a welcome and important contribution to the biomedical community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffin agrees, and said he still refers to Honey's work \"a few times a week, to be honest\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said that while case numbers are low, the data Honey shares still helps to answer important questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like how we manage our hospitals and healthcare systems, and counsel our individual patients so they have an understanding of the risk,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA legacy in medicine\n\nHoney said his uncle's legacy has inspired him to help out where he can.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis late uncle, Dr Norman Honey, dedicated his life to treating leprosy patients and fighting the disease's stigma. He worked in West Africa before moving to Hong Kong, where he served as chief medical officer.\n\n\n\nNorman Honey (centre-right) after receiving a Member of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth in 1994 for his work treating leprosy patients. Source: Supplied / Mike Honey Though much of the data is now gathered automatically, Honey said he still spends a few hours each week tracking COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while he's taken a few nasty comments on social media here and there, he's been surprised by the public's overall response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of people that say they're glad to see it, and they're hanging on it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after four years, he admits he's looking forward to the day he doesn't have to post an update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a little bit of a weight on my shoulders,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoney is hopeful the new Australian Centre for Disease Control, set to open on 1 January 2026, will take over his work.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the government should pay him for his efforts, Honey laughed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That'd be nice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThen he quickly changed his mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd probably prefer to keep it as my hobby.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "MUSIC\n\nSydney Philharmonia Choirs \u2013 Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio\n\nOpera House, December 13\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio is replete with musical glories but presents a quandary for modern performance. Bach wrote the work as six cantatas for performance on separate Christmas Feast days, a mode of presentation which is only meaningful in a liturgical context. Yet the modern habit of presenting all six cantatas one after another creates a longish concert and sometimes dampens the concentrated focus that each deserves. The Philharmonia\u2019s solution of splitting the oratorio over two separate Christmas seasons (2023 and 2025) and separating the cantatas with new Australian works was effective. After Deborah Cheetham Fraillon and Matthew Doyle\u2019s Acknowledgement of Country, Tarimi Nulay \u2013 Long Time Living Here, conductor Elizabeth Scott led the opening chorus of Part IV, Fallt mit Danken, fallt mit Loben in a tempo of lilting complacency (using that word as Jane Austen did, rather than as a derogatory term). Tenor John Longmuir, who took the narrative role of the Evangelist, brought a sense of drama and robust strength to the part, opening out splendidly in Part VI, without making the role operatic. Baritone Christopher Richardson sang the recitatives with Chorale Immanuel, o susses Wort! and Wohlan dein Name with rounded pure vowels giving his tone an aura of poised dignity.\n\nIn the echo aria, Flosst, mein Heiland, soprano Jacqueline Porter projected a richly coloured, discreetly thrilling sound, blending with oboist Alexandre Oguey and organist David Drury to create refined chamber music, while the two \u2018echo\u2019 musicians, soprano Briar Babington and oboist Eve Osborn contributed distant imitations from behind the choir. Soprano Jacqueline Porter. Concertmaster Fiona Ziegler and sister Leone Ziegler played the concerto-like violin solos in Longmuir\u2019s aria Ich will nur dir zu Ehren leben with persuasive rhythmic fluency. A characteristic of Part IV is the addition of French horns in the outer movements, which bathed the clear sound of the Philharmonia Chamber Singers in burnished warmth for the final chorale. Following this, Australian composer Phillip Cullen used Kipling\u2019s poetry and quotations from Bach\u2019s Part V for his new choral work A Nativity. With smoothly finished phrases and well-wrought traditional harmony, it began with a mournful plaint on cor anglais and ended with the choral lines haloed in high harmonics from solo violin. Scott\u2019s leadership in the opening chorus of Part V was livelier than Part IV and drew neat articulation from chorus and orchestra and fluid rhythmic sprightliness from the pair of oboes that create Part V\u2019s characteristic sound. Contralto Hannah Fraser sang the recitative with chorus, Wo ist der neugeborene Konig der Juden with wonderfully rounded pure sound.\n\nA highlight of the entire concert was the intimate musical interaction of the aria Terzetto Ach, wenn wird die Zeit erscheinen. Here Longmuir and Porter created brightly edged excitement alongside Fiona Ziegler\u2019s animated violin figuration, while Fraser soothed the music with a warm admonitory phrase \u201cbe silent, he is already here\u201d. A Prayer of Jesus by Australian composer Kayla Erin Hinton began the second half, articulating declamatory phrases accompanied by orchestration of confident radiance. Part VI, with its outer choruses laced with trumpet solos from Anthony Heinrichs, brought the concert\u2019s choral highlights, the Philharmonia Chamber Singers articulating with energised rhythmic fluidity. The work ends with the so-called \u2018Passion chorale\u2019 set with elaboration instrumentation and exultant trumpet figuration. The Philharmonia followed this with a reprise of the opening chorus of Part 1, which, though a masterpiece, was unnecessary here. The actual close, a true Bachian ending, expresses collective joy through masterly musical detail and symbolism, and says all that needs to be said. THEATRE\n\nIRVING BERLIN\u2019S HOLIDAY INN\n\nRiverside Theatres Parramatta, December 6\n\nUntil December 14\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn the 1940s, the legendary Irving Berlin (who was, ironically, Jewish) dreamt of a little number called White Christmas. At Riverside Theatres, audiences dreamt of a Christmas that doesn\u2019t sweat their entrails out, while being razzle-dazzled to distraction by the stage adaptation of Holiday Inn, a two-hour affair featuring a live band, a dizzying array of sparkle-heavy costumes, old-world charm and some vigorously inventive original choreography by Veronica Beattie George.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen a tap-dancing ensemble perform synchronised jump-rope with green tinsel, are you even in the silly season? The show features a dizzying array of sparkle-heavy costumes. Credit: Robert Catto Holiday Inn is the film that launched the world\u2019s best-selling single, which also starred musical history\u2019s most dapper dynamic duo: Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby. Filling those enormous singin\u2019 and dancin\u2019 shoes just fine in this Well Done Creative production are Rob Mallet as Jim Hardy and Max Patterson as Ted Hanover \u2013 showbiz characters whose long friendship is put to the test when Jim\u2019s domestic impulses and anxious sentimentality clash with Ted\u2019s big-time ambitions. To put it another way: narrative conflict, thy name is woman. First it\u2019s Lila (Pamela Renouf is a sensation and a hoot as the squawking, mega-talented, self-obsessed starlet). Then it\u2019s Linda Mason, (Mary McCorry, of classically beautiful looks and ravishing vocals), an independent-minded schoolteacher who sold Jim the Mason farm in Connecticut, where he hopes to start a new chapter away from the insanity of \u201cthe lifestyle\u201d. Getting festive: Matt Hourigan and Max Patterson. Credit: Robert Catto\n\nLife in the country bumpkin seat, however, turns out to be laborious, lonesome and financially challenging. With some sneaky manoeuvring from plucky farmhand Louise (Paige Fallu), he and his New York friends cook up a creative money-making ruse: to transform the property into a \u201cHoliday Inn\u201d, hosting extravagant ticketed shows (also charging guests for board) only on holidays. Cue Shaking the Blues Away! Loading There are some interesting (and essential) variations from the film. No blackface is one. There are also significant differences in narrative structure and character motivations (with Ted spared the moral grubbiness of \u201cstealing the girl\u201d romantically). Some songs are shuffled about to take on new meaning (a memorable moment comes when the otherwise silent drummer pipes up with his Cinderella plea to Ted: \u201cI\u2019m easy to dance with!\u201d), with the best comic moments still when Jim lets jealousy undermine his own show. As with so many crowd-pleasing productions, this one would benefit from being more snappy, with less stuffing. Some added Berlin hits feel interstitial, and the invigorating theatrical bombast under director Sally Dashwood loses a little pizzazz in the second half. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a lot to be enjoyed, particularly given the robust technical skills of the actors, which are geared for delight and well-balanced with their acting chops. There\u2019s a worthy takeaway, too, about freedom and autonomy. A line from French poet Guillaume Apollinaire that bookends the show reminds us what holidays are all about: \u201cNow and then, it\u2019s good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.\u201d\n\nMUSIC\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nAllianz Stadium, December 10\n\nReviewed by BERNARD ZUEL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Kendrick Lamar doesn\u2019t exactly want to be a pop star, but he doesn\u2019t not want to be one either. Take the flames left and right and two huge screens, the sparkly-framed glasses and a posse of dancers, the giant furry dice with scented tree ornament and the scaled-up stairs on an otherwise bare stage, the crack of fireworks like cannons and a whispered start with Lamar muttering in the shadows backstage, and the powerful, crisp, clear and just-short-of-overwhelming sound. All point to production values of a mega-pop show. All simple but effective manipulations of an environment effectively inhabited by only one non-dancing, rarely-speaking, charismatic but undemonstrative man.\n\nBut then what is King Kunta but a knee-cracking pop song? Even, or maybe especially in, this condensed version, followed with the skittish, swirling cinematic noir of Element. How many hooks are as elemental as Squabble Up\u2019s bare-bones lean/shuffle, brought to life by those dancers and given voice by the whole stadium, or the brass-bolstered TV Off, split into two parts, an hour apart? How many stiff-legged grooves are as welcome to people who can\u2019t necessarily dance but can strut in their seats as that offered in Humble? Kendrick Lamar doesn\u2019t want to be some generational spokesman, but he doesn\u2019t not want to be one either. Sure, the lubricious Poetic Justice was primarily focused on matters horizontal but the same territory in the old-school soul groove of Dodger Blue was laced with unceremonial frankness, and Good Credit crept into darker corners. M.A.A.D City peeled back urban sheets and showed how everything runs on tension, and within the folding-in-on-itself progressive bass and counterweight keyboards of Reincarnated was a dense story that was always racing away with his delivery but still landed punch after punch about being that very modern creature, the uncertain adult in a childlike world. Speaking of which, one thing Lamar very much does want to be is Drake Disser-in-Chief. Still. See both the shot early in the show, Euphoria, and the stronger chaser to close the set, Not Like Us. Kendrick, that man is down, boxed up and posted already.\n\nWhile his voice is the lowest profile of the on-stage sounds, that\u2019s ultimately irrelevant. If you don\u2019t already know each word of these songs you aren\u2019t serious and you aren\u2019t meant to be here. Kendrick Lamar doesn\u2019t want to be exclusive, but he doesn\u2019t not want to either. Got a problem with that?

MUSIC\n\nSOMBR\n\nHordern Pavilion, December 9\n\nReviewed by MILLIE MUROI\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 For a young artist whose fame started with a viral song on TikTok just three years ago, Sombr is surprisingly smooth and unfazed on stage.\n\nOn his first Australian tour, the 20-year-old American singer could easily have you believe he is a seasoned pro (apart from a few too many disingenuous \u201cI-love-yous\u201d when he should be getting on with the show). The setlist begins on the front foot, running through songs from Saviour, showcasing his richer, deeper tones, to We Never Dated, which drifts into an ethereal falsetto. Sombr performs during the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards. Credit: Getty Images for MTV His range is impressive and, while he may not have an especially powerful voice, he has enough to make an impact as required. Technically, he is consistent and controlled while imbuing all of his songs with that characteristic teenage angst. The show is prety much bare bones - one man and a band with basic production. But it\u2019s done well.\n\nAnd while it does drift at points in the second half, the setlist is not long enough to make it tedious. It\u2019s also a comfortable sort of dip: one that still has you swaying to the music and enjoying the atmosphere. Sombre\u2019s has some similarities to the work of The 1975\u2019s frontman Matty Healy. Their songs share stylistic and thematic similarities and during numbers such I Wish I Knew How to Quit You and Do I Ever Cross Your Mind, the tortured poet bearing seem familiar. Sombr is, however, a bit softer and more palatable than Healy. Caroline - the song Sombr wrote when he was 16 and which catapulted him to fame - and Perfume, are tender, heartfelt and delivered with precision but also a mesmerising sweetness. And while most of his lyrics are despondent, devastating or dark, there are bouncy beats, catchy bass segments and playful riffs that keep the energy high. He also finishes strong with funky songs such as 12 to 12 and his biggest hit: Back to Friends. It may not be a concert for the ages, but it\u2019s a seamless show with solid fundamentals.\n\nTHEATRE\n\nBEAUTIFUL THING\n\nQtopia Sydney, December 5\n\nUntil December 13\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd It\u2019s a seasonally fitting, welcome thing to hear happy squeals and warm laughter in response to a queer drama told on stage. Often (unless it\u2019s part cabaret), the audience\u2019s reaction is grim, choked silence \u2013 trauma the legitimate yet scarifying seam from which a lot of LGBT+ stories are mined. Allowing a gay \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d love story to have a relatively untroubled trajectory and happy ending was what made Liverpudlian dramatist Jonathan Harvey want to write Beautiful Thing. Opening in London in 1993, it went on to win a John Whiting Award, was adapted into a popular film, and had its Australian premiere at the 1998 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. This CODA production brings it back with a uniformly excellent cast, with Finn Stannard making an impressive directorial debut to close Qtopia\u2019s 2025 program.\n\nJamie (Jake Walker) and Ste (Max Dykstra). Credit: Yingying Zhang Harvey would go on to write for Coronation Street for two decades and counting, and there\u2019s a lot of this and other British soaps\u2019 recognisable tones and touchpoints here: a character-driven plot and working-class realism; young and old battling a hard-luck system with whatever\u2019s at hand (in this story, the music of Mama Cass); a matter-of-factness about the realities they\u2019re up against; violence acknowledged if not given too-graphic treatment; neighbours getting all up in each other\u2019s business; and animated dialogue that plumbs its humour from cheek, colourful patois and bluntness. Willa King as tough-love mum and worn-down barwoman Sandra steals the show on that last one (though her relentless shaming of heroically impudent expelled schoolgirl Leah as \u201cslag\u201d might be a bit dated). Set in a South London council estate, an environment summed up by three sky-blue doors on a grey tenement wall, the \u201cbeautiful thing\u201d in question is the tender relationship that forms between Hello! magazine-reading Jamie (Jake Walker) and much more athletic Ste (Max Dykstra), which begins when Ste takes refuge from an abusive father in his neighbour\u2019s bedroom. It\u2019s also how frowsy queen Sandra, her new boyfriend Tony (Michael Hogg) and \u201clost cause\u201d Leah (Poppy Cozens) react. It\u2019s not a big spoiler to say: pretty well! When Tony, a stand-in father figure, wraps trembling Jamie in a bear hug and says with a smiling reassurance \u201cit\u2019s OK\u201d after the boy comes out to his mum, a widespread corneal leakage event was seen in the audience.",

(Dan Himbrechts/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nVeteran budget-watcher Chris Richardson has predicted a near-$10 billion improvement in the bottom line for the financial year, putting his expected deficit at $32.6 billion.\n\nMr Richardson expects the improvement to come from a $14 billion upgrade to revenue, driven by stronger tax takes on high-performing super funds and partly offset by a $4 billion increase in spending.\n\nHe predicts the headline deficit, which includes \"off-budget\" spending the government uses to squirrel away items loosely classed as investments, will come in at $55.7 billion.\n\nThe budget documents will also include Treasury's updated forecasts for economic indicators such as inflation, unemployment and GDP growth.\n\nThey should include upward revisions to price growth after the inflation dragon came back to life in the September quarter.\n\nRevisions to price growth are expected in the budget update following September inflation figures. (Dean Lewins/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nDr Chalmers has also said to expect an upward revision to business investment forecasts, from 1.5 per cent to three per cent growth this financial year, reflecting a stronger-than-expected build-out of data centres.",
