(9News)\n\nMonash IVF said a review undertaken by barrister Fiona McLeod into the two unrelated cases was now complete but confirmed the full report would remain sealed to protect the privacy of the affected patients.\n\nThe mix-up at the clinic in Clayton in Melbourne's south-east was blamed on a range of factors, including IT system limitations.\n\n\"Those limitations ultimately made subsequent processes more vulnerable to human error,\" Monash IVF said in a statement to the ASX.\n\nThe review concluded the Brisbane incident was a result of human error.\n\nREAD MORE: US destroyers head toward Venezuela as Trump aims to pressure drug cartels\n\nIt was noted the two clinic incidents were \"unrelated, different in nature and occurred some years apart\".\n\n\"Both cases involved non-standard IVF treatments and circumstances that would not arise in the vast majority of IVF procedures,\" the statement continued.\n\nMonash IVF announced in June that a patient's own embryo had been transferred back to her, instead of the treatment plan at the Clayton clinic which had designated the transfer to her partner.\n\n9news.com.au understands that patient had hoped to carry her same-sex partner's baby.\n\nMonash IVF admitted to two embryo-related bungles in Melbourne and Brisbane. (Supplied)\n\nA few months earlier in April, Monash IVF confirmed a woman in Brisbane had been mistakenly implanted with the wrong embryo and given birth to a child she was unrelated to in 2023.\n\nMonash IVF said it has already implemented many of the independent review's recommendations and identified more safeguards following an internal review.\n\n\"To the affected patients and everyone who entrusts Monash IVF with their dreams of building a family, we are deeply sorry for the distress these incidents have caused,\" Monash IVF Group acting chief executive Malik Jainudeen said.\n\n\"We have implemented or will be implementing the recommendations of the independent review and have taken additional measures to reduce the risk of such incidents occurring in the future because the care and safety of our patients is and will always be at the heart of everything we do.\n\n\"For more than 50 years, MVF has been there for patients through more than 50,000 births and we look forward to continuing to support families with their fertility journey.\"\n\nMonash IVF will release its full-year results next week.\ufeff",

    "text": "A Western Sydney mother is on a mission to make retail stores safer for children after her daughter came within millimetres of being blinded in one eye by a metal hook.\n\nMaureen Ahluwalia was shopping with her two-year-old daughter, Amaira, at homewares and clothing store Harris Scarfe in Blacktown last month when the scary accident occurred.\n\nAhluwalia said her daughter was not running around, but walking calmly next to her when she suddenly collided with a slat wall hook placed at toddler height.\n\nAmaira's mother has called for retail stores to take the safety of children in their store more seriously. (Supplied)\n\n\"She turned around to do something and when she turned back she hit her eye,\" she said.\n\n\"I just saw her grab her eye and she was crying.\"\n\nAhluwalia said was confronted with how serious the injury was when her daughter opened her eye.\n\n\"She opened her eye, and there was blood starting to pool into it,\" Ahluwalia said.\n\nActing on the advice of a family member, Ahluwalia immediately rushed her daughter to see an optometrist located in the same shopping centre.\n\n\"The optometrist said that she barely missed her cornea,\" Ahluwalia said of her daughter's injury.\n\n\"If it was a millimetre in, she would have lost her vision.\"\n\nAmaira was left with a blood clot on her eye, which has since gone away.\n\nAhluwalia said she was grateful her daughter had fully recovered, but she was left furious when she went online and saw how common it was for metal hooks in shops to cause eye injuries among toddlers.\n\n\"The issue is, why are these hooks being placed at toddler height in the first place?\" she said.\n\n9news.com.au contacted Harris Scarfe owners, the Spotlight Retail Group, however they did not respond to a request for comment before publication.\n\nIn 2020, 9news.com.au reported on a spate of grisly eye injuries toddlers had sustained at Kmart and Target stores.\n\nAmong those injured was six-year-old Cecilia Chen, who was shopping with her grandmother at Kmart's Chatswood store when she collided with an apparel arm hook.\n\nCecilia needed two surgeries to repair her torn eyelid and damage to her eye.\n\nHer mother, Jill Huang, took legal action against Kmart, and the retail giant was ordered to pay the family almost $60,000 in compensation.\n\nIn response to Cecilia's case, and a string of similar accidents, Kmart and Target rolled out safety changes in December 2020, which involved adding soft plastic covers to the ends of apparel arms in stores nationwide.\n\nAhluwalia said she would like to see all retail stores implementing similar safety measures.\n\nThe mother has started a NSW parliamentary petition calling on mandatory safety standards for retail fixtures to be implemented.\n\nThe petition has gained the support of Labor MP for Blacktown, Stephen Bali, who will present the petition to the NSW Legislative Assembly.\n\nVictorian mother Amira Good said changes were needed on a national level after her son Ryder was left with a nasty injury to his face by a metal store hook in June.\n\nGood was shopping with her 2-year-old son in Kmart's Brunswick store when he collided with a metal hook in the cosmetic section.\n\nAlthough Kmart stores typically have plastic price tags covering the ends of the cosmetic rack hooks, many of the plastic slips were missing at the time, leaving pointed metal bars exposed at toddler height, Good said.\n\n\"We were just walking, and there was a metal hook hanging out at Ryder's height and as he walked past, it scraped his face,\" she said.\n\n\"He got a cut millimetres under his eye, and it went all the way from his cheek to his ear,\" Good said.\n\n\"There was so much blood.\"\n\nTwo-year-old Ryder was left with a gash across his cheek after he collided with a metal hook in Kmart's Brunswick store. (Supplied)\n\nA Kmart spokesperson told 9news.com.au the retailer was aware of the incident at its Brunswick store.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with those impacted. We are cooperating with relevant parties as we review the matter and are unable to comment on the specifics,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We want to assure our customers and team members that their safety is our highest priority.\"",

(Supplied/Claire Steinke)\n\nGiving up her dream of being a mum was not an option so during cancer treatment, she researched her options to have a child solo.\n\nUnwilling to date solely to find a father for potential children, \ufeffshe pursued intrauterine insemination (IUI), a procedure in which donor sperm is placed directly into the uterus around the time of ovulation in the hopes of a pregnancy.\ufeff\n\nDoctors warned she had less than 20 per cent chance of getting pregnant but she started trying as soon as treatment ended.\n\nSteinke fell pregnant on her third round of IUI and welcomed her son prematurely just 26 weeks later.\n\nHe spent the first weeks of his life in the NICU and Steinke broke down a few weeks into it.\n\nThe realities of going it alone\ufeff\n\nSteinke admits her pregnancy \ufeffwas often lonely and it was hard not having someone to share it with, especially when her son was in NICU.\n\n\"All of that emotion had caught up with me after 18 months of stress from a cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, fertility treatment, horrible pregnancy, and a premature baby,\" Steinke said.\n\n\"I'd been holding all this emotion in and just putting one foot in front of the other to keep going, and it just hit me.\"\n\nREAD MORE: US destroyers head toward Venezuela as Trump aims to pressure drug cartels\n\nSteinke admits her pregnancy \ufeffwas often lonely, especially when her son was in NICU.

(Supplied/Claire Steinke)\n\nMaking solo motherhood more accessible\n\nBecoming a solo mum has changed a lot since Steinke had her kids, who are now 20 and 15.\ufeff\n\nART is more accessible for single women, society has become more accepting of solo motherhood, and online communities have helped solo mums connect.\n\nEvents like the upcoming Melbourne Fertility Expo even include speakers \ufefflike Alisha Burns of the Solo Mum Society, who will speak to why more women are choosing solo motherhood.\n\nAnd Steinke herself shares her story with other women through her maternity and breastfeeding business, Soul Mothers .\n\nBecoming a solo mum has changed a lot since Steinke had her kids, who are now 20 and 15.\ufeff (Supplied/Claire Steinke)\n\nBut there are still barriers she said need addressing.\n\nSingle women deserve more \ufeffcomprehensive information about ART, including IUI, as well as opportunities to speak honestly about their lived experiences without fear of backlash or discrimination.\n\n\ufeff\"It's not someone else's decision to make, some pen pusher in an office saying, 'no, just because you're a single you can't have it,' or some religious person going, 'it's not what god wanted,'\" she said.\n\n\"I would have been gutted to not be able to have children.\"",

It's the classic 'having a go,'\" Heins said.\n\nJosh Heins insists his home should fall under vehicle regulations, not building rules.

(Virgin Australia)\n\nQantas and Virgin dominate the point industry with Frequent Flyer and Velocity, respectively.\n\nVirgin recently announced it is again shaking up the industry with its 1 Point Rewards store, which will allow members to purchase expensive items with just a single velocity point in a one-time event.\n\nAcross three capital cities, members will be able to buy\ufeff an $849 Dyson Airwrap or a pair of $549 Bose headphones with just one point.\n\nVelocity Frequent Flyer chief executive Nick Rohrlach told 9news.com.au Virgin is taking a second bite of the cherry after hosting a similar store in 2023 due to customer demand for more \"achievable\" point spending.\n\n\"We are try to make it much easier to get to that reward rather than saving up for years for something you may or may get,\" Rohrlach said.\n\n\"Our research says that 90 per cent of Aussies are members of a loyalty program.\n\n\"And rather than tying people up with points whispers and all the complexity, we're just trying to make it much simpler and easier to use and that you know that you can get rewards really fast.\"\n\nBunnings is following suit with a program allowing Flybuys members to turn their points into dollars spent at the hardware giant.\n\n\ufeffIt will let customers use as little as $10 in Flybuys points to buy Bunnings products.\n\nVirgin annnounced it is bringin back its 1 Point Rewards store. (Virgin Australia)\n\nPayment Services managing director Brad Kelly is a point guru.\n\nHe doesn't think the future of frequent programs is shaping up to be so peachy.\n\n\"The devaluation is already beginning,\" Kelly explained to 9news.com.au.\n\n\"There's a lot of people sitting on a lot of points post-COVID and they want them to burn those.\n\n\"That's how they dilute the offers.\"\n\nVirgin\ufeff last year lowered the amount of points needed for a one-way economy seat to 5900 velocity points.\n\nBut Velocity credit card customers had the number of points earned per dollar dropped in April this year, decreasing from five to four points.\n\nIt was the first time Qantas marked up its classic reward pricing since 2019 and the second time since 2004.\n\n\"A lot has changed in the last six years,\" Qantas loyalty chief executive Andrew Glance said at the time.\n\n\"These adjustments will ensure we can continue to invest in enhancing the program for the long-term and continue to grow the levels of classic and classic plus reward seat availability for members year on year.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Qantas\ufeff hiked up the points needed to redeem fares. (Nine)\n\nKelly said it is going to become even harder for point collectors to nab their dream flight on points alone.\n\n\"\ufeffIf you're a bronze member, you're going to see these Classic Plus seats everywhere and the occasional classic, but you're not going to be able to redeem as much as you want or as easily,\" he said.\n\nHe estimated \ufeffvaluable point earning is a game \"for the top 20 per cent\".\n\n\"Your average Qantas member only spends about $30,000 a year on their credit card,\" Kelly added.\n\n\"That's going to get you 30,000 points if you're lucky, probably more like 20,000 to 25,000. You are going to have a lot of difficulty getting anywhere for 25,000 points.\n\nAnd even then, do you really want to go to Ballina on a Tuesday afternoon in August? That's the reality. You're not going to be able to say, 'Oh, I'd like to fly business class to Bali'.\n\n\"That's just not going to happen.\"\n\nBrad Kelly thinks credit card spend won't be so tied to reward points in the future. (Getty)\n\nRohrlach said Velocity is looking at finding ways to accelerate non-credit card point earning.\n\nHe doesn't want point whisperers to be the only ones who can find the best deals.\n\n\"There's lots of different ways to earn points and it's always nice when people find new ways to do that. But also, it's not hard,\" Rohrlach added.\n\n\"It's not just about the points hacking.\"\n\nQantas Loyalty chief executive Andrew Glance told 9news.com.au that the number of points earned through retailers has doubled in the past five years.\n\n\"We anticipate it will double again by 2030, as we expand our footprint across a growing range of retail categories,\" he said.\n\nKelly's prediction for the industry\ufeff is the slow erosion of needing to sign up for a credit card to accumulate points.\n\nHe also said point earning may soon be largely attributed to spend instead of credit.\n\n\"\ufeffWhat I mean by that is that a customer will sign up directly with a merchant or a bunch of merchants, and as they spend, those merchants will buy points directly from Qantas [or Virgin] and give them to the customer,\" Kelly added.",

    "text": "Former Liberal MP Daryl Maguire has been handed a 10-month jail sentence for giving misleading evidence to the NSW corruption watchdog \u2014 but has been granted bail pending an appeal.\n\nMaguire was a witness at the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in 2018 during an inquiry that focused on the former Canterbury City Council.\n\nThe ex-member for Wagga Wagga was quizzed about whether he expected to benefit financially from a multi-million-dollar property deal.\n\nIn the witness box, he initially denied ever doing business with former councillor Michael Hawatt or seeking payment for brokering a deal on behalf of a Chinese property developer, before intercepted phone calls between the pair were played to him.\n\nMaguire was found guilty in June, after Magistrate Clare Farnan found his initial assertions that there was nothing in the deal for him were \"clearly misleading\".\n\nShe said Maguire had given prior thought to what he was likely to be asked at the inquiry and essentially prepared a \"broad-brush response\" that took into account messages he had retrieved.\n\nMagistrate Farnan was satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that he gave the evidence in question \"knowing that it was misleading, and not believing it to be true\".\n\nToday, she handed Maguire a sentence of 10 months with a non-parole period of five months.\n\nMaguire tried to 'protect reputation', magistrate says\n\nMagistrate Farnan said she could not be satisfied his motivation for giving the misleading evidence was an expectation of an ongoing financial benefit.\n\nThere were \"a number of possible motivations\", she said in sentencing, and there is no evidence about his reasons because Maguire pleaded not guilty and still denies the offence.\n\n\"Mr Maguire was clearly trying to protect his reputation, possibly amongst other things,\" she said.\n\nMagistrate Farnan said the community expected a politician who takes an oath or affirmation to give honest evidence, whatever the nature of the proceedings.\n\n\"The community is entitled to expect that those who hold high public office will conduct themselves with integrity,\" she said.\n\nShe accepted Maguire had been a \"diligent\" local member and had been committed to furthering the interests of his electorate, after taking into account character references.\n\nShe considered the seriousness of the offence to be in the \"middle of the range\" and said Maguire, who was assessed as having \"good\" prospects of rehabilitation, did not maintain his position later during his appearance at the ICAC.\n\n'Will of community to eradicate corruption'\n\nAfter the sentence was imposed, Maguire's counsel Rebecca Gall said he would lodge an appeal and sought to be heard on a bail application pending that appeal.\n\nOn Friday, Crown Prosecutor Phil Hogan pushed for Maguire to be sent to prison, saying only a full-time custodial sentence would achieve the goal of expressing \"the will of the community \u2026 to eradicate corruption\".\n\nBut Ms Gall said a sentence served in the community with a large community service element would \"send an appropriately strong and public message\".\n\nWhat the ICAC found out about Daryl Maguire Photo shows composite images of Daryl Maguire and a bag and wads of cash spread out on a table. The inquiry into former MP Daryl Maguire has uncovered much more than his secret relationship with Gladys Berejiklian.\n\nShe said he was \"under considerable personal distress\" at the time of the ICAC appearance and that he acknowledged his offending \"has contributed to a loss of trust in the community\".\n\nDuring the hearing, Maguire's lawyers argued the questions asked at ICAC were imprecise, ambiguous and open to a range of interpretations.\n\nBut Magistrate Farnan ultimately did not accept the criticism that it was never put to Maguire what \"doing business\" with Mr Hawatt was referring to specifically and said there was a \"global\" denial of doing business.\n\n\"I do not consider that the questioning bore any ambiguity, and the accused was offered every opportunity to explain answers that he gave by further questioning in relation to them,\" she said in her judgement in June.\n\nOperation on planning proposals\n\nThe ICAC inquiry, Operation Dasha, investigated whether officials including those at the former Canterbury City Council dishonestly exercised official functions in relation to planning proposals between 2013 and 2016.\n\nOne site, opposite Canterbury Hospital and known as Harrisons, was proposed to become a large unit development.\n\nIn the intercepted phone calls, Maguire was recorded saying \"What have you got on your books? What is DA approved?\" \u2014 and asking what Mr Hawatt's margin was.\n\nThe two men estimated the development to be worth up to $48 million and Mr Hawatt suggested a margin of between 1.5 and 2 per cent was likely.\n\nMaguire replied: \"1.5 per cent isn't enough divided by two, if you know what I mean.\"\n\nMagistrate Farnan was satisfied that Maguire's prepared response to anticipated questions was that he had \"never asked for a dollar\".",

With more than 100,000 treatment cycles taking place yearly in Australia's growing IVF industry, those with first-hand experience say it's time for changes to increase transparency and simplify regulations.\n\nThe Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) used the release of the report to renew calls for nationally consistent regulation in the fertility sector.\n\n\"These events, though rare, are deeply serious and demand a system-wide response,\" FSANZ said in a statement.\n\n\"The current patchwork of state-based regulation is no longer adequate.\n\n\"Only a nationally consistent framework can provide the transparency and accountability the community rightly expects.\"\n\nFertility giant 'deeply sorry'\n\nMonash IVF told the ASX it had already implemented many of the recommendations from the independent review.\n\n'Human error' to blame for Monash IVF embryo mix-up \u2014 could it happen again? Photo shows A close up of a baby in white muslin wrap with stars on it, being held by two adults. No faces are visible. While experts say this case is \"unprecedented\" in Australia, it's happened multiple times in the US, as far back as 1999.\n\n\"Following its own internal review, additional safeguards and protocols have already been implemented and the company is committed to implementing the remainder of the recommendations,\" the company said.\n\n\"These additional safeguards and protocols go beyond the recommendations contained in the independent review.\n\n\"The cost involved in implementing the recommendations and additional safeguards and protocols are not anticipated to have a material impact on financial performance.\"\n\nMonash IVF chief executive officer Michael Knaap resigned following revelations of the Melbourne embryo mix-up in June.\n\nChief financial officer and company secretary Malik Jainudeen was appointed as acting CEO.\n\n\"To the affected patients and everyone who entrusts Monash IVF with their dreams of building a family, we are deeply sorry for the distress these incidents have caused,\" he said today.",

(ABC Tropical North: Hannah Walsh)\n\nSam Faint, chair of community advocacy group ClermontCONNECT, said this would mean 10\u201315 fewer GP appointments a day.\n\nShe said initially an integrated roster system allowed Dr Lane flexibility to run the GP practice \"while prioritising work inside the hospital\".\n\n\"We just got to stability, like we have literally just got there, and we had everything just thrown up in the air,\" she said.\n\n\"It's unlikely that the surgery will be able to continue to be viable if that model doesn't revert back to what it was.\"\n\nDr Lane declined to comment but, in a statement, his practice manager Deb Shore said changes meant the GP clinic would reduce opening hours.\n\n\"[It will] limit the flexibility we've had to support the hospital emergency department and collaborate with the health service when needed,\" the statement read.\n\nThe Clermont Hospital had previously been relying on locum doctors to fill the gap in health care.

    "text": "General practitioners and clinic owners say red tape and a lack of supervisors are preventing internationally trained doctors from filling the gaps in Australia's healthcare system.\n\nAustralia is short by about 2,400 full-time equivalent GPs, with communities in Western Australia's north among those feeling the consequences.\n\nDr Izhar Hashim was a specialist doctor in Malaysia before deciding to practice in Australia.\n\nIzhar Hashim describes the fellowship process as long and unnecessarily complicated. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Brianna Mellville)\n\nIt took more than a year for Dr Hashim's working visa to be approved, and now he is undergoing two years of training to be certified as an Australian GP.\n\nCurrently completing his fellowship in Geraldton, 400 kilometres north of Perth, he said the shortage of available doctors was obvious.\n\n\"Even when I'm at the airport the first time, the immigration staff were quite happy that I am a GP,\" he said.\n\nThe fellowship process involved exams and being supervised by a vocationally registered GP.\n\n\"You have to wait for a lot of time to get something done, and it's a bit frustrating,\" he said.\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (APHRA) maintain and enforce GP standards across the country.\n\nDr Hashim said the overlapping regulatory bodies complicated the process, and he had to provide the same documents to both agencies.\n\nSupervisor shortages\n\nOne aspect limiting internationally trained doctors from becoming fellows has been the lack of supervisors in regional locations.\n\nA local practice in Broome was forced to close due to the lack of an in-person supervisor to monitor training practitioners.\n\nThe only GP clinic in Northampton, in WA's Midwest, also closed earlier this year due to funding and staff issues.\n\nSpectrum Health chief executive Phillip Coelho oversees more than 50 medical centres across WA, including the now-defunct Broome practice.\n\nThe Broome Doctors Practice on Napier Terrace will not be reopening. (ABC Kimberley: Vanessa Mills)\n\nMr Coelho said supervisor incentives were \"non-existent\" and the work was unpaid, time-consuming, and challenging.\n\n\"The only way you can get GPs into rural areas is from overseas and the beloved government of ours keeps interfering in the guidelines, making it more difficult,\" he said.\n\n\" Having a supervisor physically present \u2026 sounds good, but in this day and age, with the modern technology, you don't have to have another doctor physically sitting there. \"\n\n'No GP better than an unsafe one'\n\nRACGP rural faculty chair Michael Clements said some practices' desire to remove red tape was motivated by money, rather than making healthcare accessible.\n\nBut he conceded that a lack of supervisors was impacting GP training and availability in some country towns.\n\nMichael Clements says having no GP in a regional town is better than having an unsafe one. (Supplied: Fairfield Central Medical Practice)\n\n\"Some corporate entities look at a doctor as a money-making machine and will happily put a doctor somewhere \u2026 without giving that doctor the due respect and time they deserve,\" Dr Clements said.\n\n\" I think there are many politicians [as well] that would prefer to see any doctor in a town because it meets their political needs, than having a safe doctor in the town. \"\n\nHe agreed supervisor shortages posed an issue and \"one of our greatest\" was finding GPs with the capacity to take on trainees.\n\nA solution to the shortage\n\nTrainee GP Nicole Wong has taken advantage of the new program from the RACGP that provides training posts in communities.\n\nDr Wong was in her second term of training and moved to Karratha, 1,530km north of Perth, earlier this month.\n\nShe jumped at the chance to move regionally, particularly for the chance to provide continuous care to locals.\n\nNicole Wong recently moved to Karratha to continue training. (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland )\n\n\"I enjoy camping, I like being out in nature. I'm not fussed that I can't go shopping every weekend, or that if I do go shopping,\" she said.\n\n\" I love the intergenerational care as well, caring for every member of the family. I think that's so special, and I feel really lucky to be able to do that. \"\n\nDr Wong's training supervisor, Dr Keith Figueiredo, is the director of Panaceum Health based in Geraldton, 1,100km south of Karratha.\n\nHe said Karratha was one of the first locations to have a remote registrar.\n\n\"Every week I'll catch up with Nicole to discuss cases or any concerns that she has, plus anytime that she has any queries, she can message me anytime or phone me anytime,\" Dr Figueiredo said.\n\nHe said the lack of housing and childcare remained key obstacles to coaxing doctors away from major cities.\n\nReforming pathways\n\nIn a statement, AHPRA said they were focused on reforming pathways for international medical specialists.\n\nA spokesperson cited the Expedited Specialist Pathway introduced last year, but this was limited to specialist-qualified doctors and only those trained in the UK, Ireland, or New Zealand are eligible.\n\nMeredith Hammat says her department is always looking at ways to support GPs. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\nWA Health Minister Meredith Hammat said state and federal governments were regularly in talks about getting more GPs into regional communities.\n\nOther colleges, including the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, also offer remote, over-the-phone supervision programs.",

And then sometimes I just look at it. And then sometimes I just try to get away from it \u2014 but it's always there. \"\n\nGrief a 'daily struggle'\n\nPlaza and Baena began dating in 2011 and the pair married in 2021.\n\nIn March, a medical examiner's report confirmed the pair separated four months before Baena's death.\n\nAubrey Plaza featured in multiple Jeff Baena films. (AP: Invision/Willy Sanjuan)\n\nPlaza starred in Baena's directorial debut, the 2014 zombie comedy Life After Beth, and appeared in two of his other films, The Little Hours and Spin Me Round.\n\nIn 2009 she shot to fame on Parks and Recreation, working alongside Poehler as well Nick Offerman, Chris Pratt, and later Adam Scott.\n\nIn 2023, she was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role on the second season of The White Lotus, and then starred in the Marvel television series Agatha All Along.\n\nShe appeared on Poehler's podcast to promote her latest film, Honey Don't!, which also stars Margaret Qualley.\n\n\"Overall, I'm here and I'm functioning. I feel really grateful to be moving through the world,\" Plaza said.\n\n\"But it's like a daily struggle, obviously.\"",

    "text": "US President Donald Trump blasted an appeal court's decision to temporarily block federal officials from completing a land transfer needed for Rio Tinto and BHP to develop Arizona's Resolution Copper project.\n\n\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Monday that the transfer - which had been slated for Tuesday - should be halted while the court weighs a request from the San Carlos Apache tribe to block the project for religious, cultural and environmental reasons.\n\nThe mine's construction would cause a crater that would swallow a site where the Apache worship. That has fueled strong opposition from all but one of the state's 22 Native American tribes, as well as the National Congress of American Indians.\n\nIt was the first time any court has ruled in favour of the Apache or their allies in more than five years of myriad legal manoeuvres against Resolution, slated to become one of the world's largest supplies of a metal used to build nearly every electronic device.\n\nTrump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, called the court a \"radical left court\" and said that those who oppose the mine \"are Anti-American, and representing other copper competitive Countries.\" \"It is so sad that Radical Left Activists can do this, and affect the lives of so many people,\" Trump said in the post. \"We can't continue to allow this to happen to the U.S.A.!\" Trump did not outline any actions he plans to take to sway the court, but said that \"our Country, quite simply, needs Copper \u2014 AND NOW!\"\n\nThe court made clear it takes \"no position on the merits\" of the Apache's arguments and would expedite its review. The court asked for filings to be submitted by October 14, but has not yet scheduled a hearing date. Ten of the appeal court's 29 members were appointed by Trump.\n\nRio, which owns 55% of the project to BHP's 45%, declined to comment on Trump's post, but said it was \"confident the court will ultimately affirm\" the land transfer.\n\nTrump's post comes less than a month after he imposed a copper tariff on wiring and pipe, but not the copper concentrate produced by mines themselves, a levy falling far short of what the mining industry had expected. That will allow other countries to import copper into the U.S. without fear of tariff implications.",

(ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)\n\nDrought drives prices higher\n\nA leg of lamb is selling for $13 per kilo at Coles and Woolworths, up from $8 per kilo in the major supermarkets in January 2024.\n\nChops are now $21 per kilo at Coles, up from $12.50 just 18 months ago.\n\nRachael Yeo has cut back on buying lamb for her family. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)\n\nSmeaton mother and community cook Rachael Yeo said despite lamb being her favourite meat, it was no longer a regular staple on her dinner table.\n\n\"We used to have lamb maybe once a week, but now we're probably only having it once a month,\" she said.\n\n\"It's too expensive and chicken is a lot cheaper, we can buy good quality free range chicken for a really good price so we opt for that now.\"\n\nMr Dalgleish says lamb prices will remain high for years to come.

(ABC News: Kyle Harley)\n\nSupermarkets can keep their prices lower than butchers by offsetting losses on certain cuts of meat to other products, because of their larger economies of scale.\n\n\"You have to walk all the way to the back of the store to the meat aisle, and on the way you might pick up five or six other items, so there is a sales strategy there,\" Mr Dalgleish said.\n\n\"It makes it tough for independent butchers.\n\n\"I think we will eventually see this high price [in the saleyards] flow through to the retailers, absolutely.\"\n\nMr Cashman is considering increasing the price of lamb at his butcher store. (ABC Landline: Pip Courtney)\n\nA Coles spokesperson said there was still strong overall demand for lamb with some customers \"looking for value and others opting for more premium cuts rather than eating out\".\n\n\"We're always looking for opportunities to deliver value on top-quality Australian lamb, and other meat, for our customers, while also supporting fair prices for farmers,\" a Woolworths spokesperson said.\n\nWoolworths charges $19 per kilo for lamb chops, or $16 on special in Ballarat in July. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)\n\nPrice increases to continue\n\nAustralia's sheep flock is shrinking, with numbers expected to stay low until at least 2027.\n\nLamb prices are expected to remain high until the flock recovers from the drought.\n\n\"If the drought is to continue for another six or nine months, then it will have a longer-term impact on the quality, but currently the [quality reduction] is only minimal,\" Mr Harrison said.\n\nMr Dalgleish said lamb prices would continue to rise.\n\n\"We're going to keep paying more and more into the next few years just because of that tight supply and very strong offshore demand,\" he said.",

Got it Share\n\nTen years ago, Frank Fawkner made the difficult decision to step away from his role as head chef of Muse \u2013 which was the Hunter Valley\u2019s most celebrated restaurant at the time \u2013 to strike out on his own. A decade on, and his own restaurant, EXP., has just been awarded a second hat by Good Food, with Good Food Guide editor David Mathews calling it \u201cthe most exciting restaurant in the region\u201d. EXP. Restaurant chef-owner Frank Fawkner plating up a dish. Dean Sewell To mark the milestone, Fawkner is hosting Ten Years of EXP., a dinner series spread across four nights next month, from Friday, September 19, to Monday, September 22. Each evening will showcase 10 of the restaurant\u2019s most iconic dishes reimagined. On the Friday evening, Good Food app editor Erina Starkey will host a Q&A with Fawkner to explore the decade-long evolution of EXP. and the vision behind it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the dishes making a comeback will be EXP.\u2019s Ego, which is Fawkner\u2019s version of the Magnum ice-cream. Introduced to the menu in 2018, the frozen dessert was originally made with a wattleseed parfait filling, lemon myrtle caramel and Daintree chocolate shell. Duck with fermented cabbage and duck-fat hollandaise. Dean Sewell \u201cWe\u2019ve done around 10 or 12 versions over the years using similar types of ice-cream or with different layers, or coated in meringue and torched,\u201d Fawkner says. For the dinner, he\u2019ll be updating it with a truffle-infused cream made using local Kanimbla truffles and macadamia praline. Longtime diners at EXP. will also recognise Redgate Farm duck, which is sourced from a free-range farm in nearby Seaham. It\u2019s a fixture of the menu, where you can often find it wood-roasted over iron bark or cherry wood, or cured into salami, chorizo, prosciutto and lardo. The duck will be served two ways: a seven-day dry-aged duck breast with black garlic hollandaise, and a duck and pistachio terrine, wrapped in smoked duck \u201cbacon\u201d made from pressed duck legs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarrigal greens curry tart with pickled cucamelon and desert lime. Dean Sewell Over dinner, Fawkner will share the story of EXP., from its origins at Oakvale Wines to its pivotal move to Pokolbin Village Estate in 2020, where Fawkner added a chef\u2019s counter and shifted to a tasting menu format. What hasn\u2019t changed, though, is the restaurant\u2019s commitment to delivering an immersive experience \u2013 not just through the food and wine or the service, but through the furniture, handcrafted by a local wood sculptor, and the knives and forks, custom-forged by a local metal artist. EXP. Restaurant makes its own charcuterie in house. Dean Sewell \u201cOne in three of our diners will turn over our brass charger plates to see if there\u2019s a signature or brand on the back,\u201d Fawkner says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking ahead, Fawkner would like to phase out all standard cutlery in favour of handmade artisan pieces. He\u2019s also exploring a revamp of the dining room layout, and some new tables and chairs. Getting the restaurant to where it is today has been a process of constant refinement, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been building and building and building, and trying to give people the best experience we can. To be recognised for that now is amazing.\u201d Ten Years of EXP will be held at EXP. Restaurant at the Pokolbin Village Estate on Friday, September 19, to Monday, September 22, $185 for a six-course menu of 10 dishes. Matched wines are priced at an additional $90 per person, or upgrade to the somm selection for $150.

    "text": "An Australian born in Europe, the narrator seems to be a journalist who has returned, perhaps recently, from the Middle East. We learn that he is travelling west, to Karilwara, Ngaanyatjarra country. He is hoping to see an old friend and man of high degree, Mr Giles, a traditional doctor who is also a famed artist busy navigating the humbug of craven dealers, gallery folk and \u201ca praetorian guard of collectors from down south\u201d.\n\nYilkari offers a vision of the Western Desert filled with drifters and sundowners, vagrants, vagabonds, loners and backpackers and desert specialists. The world through which its unnamed narrator journeys, accompanied by various companions, is one you can hear and smell: desert oak and dunes, burnt mulga plains, ironwoods, sacred sites, conception places, station homesteads, bungalows, Queenslanders, ageing diesel pumps and sorry camps and caravan parks attended by frantic camp dogs.\n\nNicolas Rothwell has written eight books but Yilkari is a first: a collaboration, co-authored with his wife, Alison Nampitjinpa Anderson, a Luritja-Pintupi artist and writer from the Western Desert community of Papunya.\n\nOver the following four chapters \u2013 each vignette is linked and works to refract its neighbours \u2013 he journeys further across the country. This trip becomes a search for a sense of place. The country is understood as something to be taken in, read and lived and travelled through, loved and feared and complicated by and invested in. A gateway through which the past becomes clearer and the self opens to a kind of unguarded reckoning.\n\nAuthor Nicolas Rothwell.\n\nThe first of the narrator\u2019s travelling companions is Jan Valentin, a Central European composer and \u201cbrother spirit\u201d brought up in Siberia. Valentin reads the land as a wilderness. For the narrator, it offers refuge. Valentin\u2019s presence prompts memories of the fall of the Berlin Wall, erected as the narrator is born, toppling by the time he first meets Valentin. Such memories are among the few we learn of the narrator\u2019s past; mostly he serves as a receptive ear for the stories his companions offer.\n\nLike Valentin, the narrator fears having expended or lost touch with the vitality of his art. His practice of listening and conversing mirrors the practice Valentin describes as embodying the ideal approach to music: \u201cSounds from outside come into you. They crystallise inside you.\u201d The narrator\u2019s relationship with his itinerant father has perhaps encouraged him to seek belonging.\n\nHence the book\u2019s title, a word meaning, among other things, \u201cclarity; everlastingness\u201d. The narrator\u2019s travelling companions are not just interlocutors but \u201cguarding spirits\u201d, each of whom offers a different but connected kind of Yilkari. One companion, Dylan, calls it the \u201cdream of union\u201d: a union that is both metaphysical and tied to place, to the fact of country as a living, charged presence.",

The meeting is a key part of the government's strategy to build national consensus around economic reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers has said the ideas discussed at the roundtable will inform \"the next three budgets and beyond\".

What hasn\u2019t changed, though, is the restaurant\u2019s commitment to delivering an immersive experience \u2013 not just through the food and wine or the service, but through the furniture, handcrafted by a local wood sculptor, and the knives and forks, custom-forged by a local metal artist. EXP. Restaurant makes its own charcuterie in house. Dean Sewell \u201cOne in three of our diners will turn over our brass charger plates to see if there\u2019s a signature or brand on the back,\u201d Fawkner says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking ahead, Fawkner would like to phase out all standard cutlery in favour of handmade artisan pieces. He\u2019s also exploring a revamp of the dining room layout, and some new tables and chairs. Getting the restaurant to where it is today has been a process of constant refinement, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been building and building and building, and trying to give people the best experience we can. To be recognised for that now is amazing.\u201d Ten Years of EXP will be held at EXP. Restaurant at the Pokolbin Village Estate on Friday, September 19, to Monday, September 22, $185 for a six-course menu of 10 dishes. Matched wines are priced at an additional $90 per person, or upgrade to the somm selection for $150.

    "text": "An Australian born in Europe, the narrator seems to be a journalist who has returned, perhaps recently, from the Middle East. We learn that he is travelling west, to Karilwara, Ngaanyatjarra country. He is hoping to see an old friend and man of high degree, Mr Giles, a traditional doctor who is also a famed artist busy navigating the humbug of craven dealers, gallery folk and \u201ca praetorian guard of collectors from down south\u201d.\n\nYilkari offers a vision of the Western Desert filled with drifters and sundowners, vagrants, vagabonds, loners and backpackers and desert specialists. The world through which its unnamed narrator journeys, accompanied by various companions, is one you can hear and smell: desert oak and dunes, burnt mulga plains, ironwoods, sacred sites, conception places, station homesteads, bungalows, Queenslanders, ageing diesel pumps and sorry camps and caravan parks attended by frantic camp dogs.\n\nNicolas Rothwell has written eight books but Yilkari is a first: a collaboration, co-authored with his wife, Alison Nampitjinpa Anderson, a Luritja-Pintupi artist and writer from the Western Desert community of Papunya.\n\nOver the following four chapters \u2013 each vignette is linked and works to refract its neighbours \u2013 he journeys further across the country. This trip becomes a search for a sense of place. The country is understood as something to be taken in, read and lived and travelled through, loved and feared and complicated by and invested in. A gateway through which the past becomes clearer and the self opens to a kind of unguarded reckoning.\n\nAuthor Nicolas Rothwell.\n\nThe first of the narrator\u2019s travelling companions is Jan Valentin, a Central European composer and \u201cbrother spirit\u201d brought up in Siberia. Valentin reads the land as a wilderness. For the narrator, it offers refuge. Valentin\u2019s presence prompts memories of the fall of the Berlin Wall, erected as the narrator is born, toppling by the time he first meets Valentin. Such memories are among the few we learn of the narrator\u2019s past; mostly he serves as a receptive ear for the stories his companions offer.\n\nLike Valentin, the narrator fears having expended or lost touch with the vitality of his art. His practice of listening and conversing mirrors the practice Valentin describes as embodying the ideal approach to music: \u201cSounds from outside come into you. They crystallise inside you.\u201d The narrator\u2019s relationship with his itinerant father has perhaps encouraged him to seek belonging.\n\nHence the book\u2019s title, a word meaning, among other things, \u201cclarity; everlastingness\u201d. The narrator\u2019s travelling companions are not just interlocutors but \u201cguarding spirits\u201d, each of whom offers a different but connected kind of Yilkari. One companion, Dylan, calls it the \u201cdream of union\u201d: a union that is both metaphysical and tied to place, to the fact of country as a living, charged presence.",
