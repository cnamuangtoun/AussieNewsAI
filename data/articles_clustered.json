(Facebook/SilvoHarvest by Farleigh Farms)\n\nDuckworth said Sunshine Coast Council did not tell her that part of the 52-acre family farm she managed would be in the firing line of the rezoning project .\n\nShe said she only found out when \ufeffher \ufefffather Don Hungerford, who started Farleigh Farm in the 1960s, suggested she check the council website.\n\n\"We didn't get any notification or communication or anything from council, they just did it,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"Our council rates are going to skyrocket because we'll be paying rates for farmland that's zoned as residential, even though we're not connected to sewerage or water.\"\n\nHave you got a story?

(Facebook/SilvoHarvest by Farleigh Farms)\n\nIt's been in her family for almost 60 years \ufeffand selling the land on which her father built their first family home is unthinkable.\n\n\"I plan on on farming for the next sixty years of my life and passing it down to my children,\" Duckworth said.\n\n\"But if we have to \ufefftake council to court, we definitely will.\"",

A DJ at night and a competitive trail runner in the summer.\n\n\"I've always loved pushing my limits,\" she said.\n\n\"It just so happened that I've truly fallen in love with skimo. I live for adventuring in the mountains; it makes me feel alive.\n\n\"In the winter, skiing is the priority and trail running helps me maintain a higher training volume and adds to my fitness. My pursuits in music help fuel my training sessions, as I use it as a tool. They also add a creative element to my life, which is heavily focused on mountain sports.\"\n\nBellingham has competed in cross-country events at the Sochi, PyeongChang and Beijing Olympics, finishing 22nd in the team sprint with Seve de Campo.\n\nPhil Bellingham has competed in three different Olympics as a cross country skier. (Getty Images: Al Bello)\n\nHe will be just the second Australian to compete in two Winter Olympic sports, after Jenny Lyons (nee Owens), who competed in alpine skiing in 2002 and then in freestyle skiing (ski cross) in 2010 and 2014.\n\n\"It means a lot to me to be named in another Olympic team,\" Bellingham, 34, said.\n\n\"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would compete at four Olympics, so it's an absolute honour.\n\n\"The journey has been long and quite humbling. I had to go back to the beginning, work on the basics and rebuild myself from the ground up. But this process was also quite inspiring as I saw quick improvements and it was a new challenge on what I'd been doing for so long.\"\n\nSki mountaineering, or skimo, is the newest of the Olympic sports and will be contested for the first time at this year's Winter Games.\n\nIt did previously feature at the 2020 Youth Olympic Winter Games in Lausanne.\n\nApart from the obvious question, what even is ski mountaineering, there are plenty of other queries that need addressing too. For example, how do athletes slide up hill on skis? What on earth are skins? And why is it suited to Australian slopes?\n\nWhat is skimo?\n\nIn skimo, athletes spend at least some of the time running up the hill. (Getty Images: Francesco Scaccianoce)\n\nImmensely popular in the European Alps, skimo sees skiers climb up the side of a mountain on their skis, or sometimes on foot with the skis attached to their backs, before descending back down in a far more orthodox manner.\n\nSkiers are able to climb up hill with skis on as they have \"skins\" attached, strips of fabric that allow the ski to grip on the uphill sections.\n\n\"Skimo, in the traditional sense of the word \u2026 it's like back-country skiing, but lightweight and efficient,\" Hamilton told ABC Sport.\n\n\"You use the skis to go and ideally explore places that are off-piste, trying to get up high, tag some peaks and then, once you've climbed, you rip your skins off and you transition the skis to downhill mode and you ski down the mountain.\"\n\nThe skins then need to be removed \u2014 but not discarded. They are stored in a little pouch on the front of the athlete's ski suit before they head back downhill.\n\nTime is of the essence in a skimo sprint, so skins are removed in spectacular fashion. (Getty Images: Francesco Scaccianoce)\n\n\"The discipline that's going to the Olympics is the sprint, which features all the techniques and skills of ski mountaineering, from a transition aspect and a downhill-skiing aspect,\" Hamilton said.\n\n\"But there are also other disciplines like vertical, individual, and a mixed relay, which is also going to be featured in the Olympics.\"\n\nSprint races will only last about three minutes, with a qualification round before semi-finals and finals, which all take place on the same day.\n\nIndividual races last a whole lot longer, between an hour and two hours.\n\nAt the 2026 Games there are men's and women's sprint events, as well as a mixed team relay that features one man and one woman who each complete the course twice.\n\nWhy Australia could 'fall in love' with skimo\n\nLara Hamilton is Australia's first skimo Olympian. (Supplied: Lara Hamilton)\n\nHamilton got into skimo essentially to keep herself fit during the winter.\n\nA professional trail runner who competes on the world cup circuit or Golden Trail series, Hamilton used the cold winters in her Colorado training base to get out on skis and keep up her extraordinary fitness levels.\n\n\"I transitioned over from Nordic skiing and that's a pretty smooth transition, I guess, in the way that classic skiing is kind of a similar movement, but mainly because I was living in Colorado at the time and where I was living is the coldest city in the lower 48 [states],\" Hamilton said.\n\n\"I needed another medium to kind of keep my volume up and stay fit.\n\n\"I noticed everyone was skiing up the hill after the lifts had shut and before they had opened in the mornings and I thought, 'OK, I'll just invest in a pair of these lightweight skimo set-up skis.\n\n\"With the advice from some friends [I] just started joining the local groups, making friends who did the sport, and that was that.\n\n\"That was at the end of 2021. And yeah, I haven't stopped since.\"\n\nHamilton noted Australia's ski fields were \"awesome\" for skimo.\n\n\"I really feel like it's a sport that Australia will fall in love with \u2026 it's like hiking but with skis on,\" Hamilton said.\n\n\"You can see things that you couldn't normally see in the winter unless you climb up there.\n\n\"Australia's environment is actually awesome for it because a lot of our slopes are not super steep \u2026 the avalanche risk is slightly less, so it would be a really good medium to explore the back country.\"\n\nWhere is it taking place?\n\nUp on the left, down on the right, at the Stelvio Alpine Skiing Centre. (Getty Images: Francesco Scaccianoce)\n\nAscending the famous Stelvio is nothing new \u2014 if you're a cyclist in the Giro d'Italia, that is.\n\nBut it's on these famous slopes where the inaugural Olympic skimo competition will take place, around the village of Bormio.\n\nIt is the same area that will host the men's alpine skiing events.\n\nThe course has already been given the tick of approval from athletes, who took to the slopes in February 2025 for the official test event.\n\nIt featured four sections: an ascent on skins, followed by a 10-metre elevation gain on steps climbed on foot, another short ski ascent and finally, a 70m downhill course with banked turns.\n\n\"The course is very good, so it promises to be a great Olympic Games next year,\" two-time overall World Cup winner Thibault Anselmet of France told Olympics.com.\n\n\"There's everything, some very steep parts, some parts that are a bit flatter, a nice gate, a nice downhill.\"\n\nFrenchwoman Emily Harrop and Spaniard Oriol Cardona Coll claimed victories in what was the fifth leg of the 2024/25 ISMF World Cup.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

Industry experts say there is no excuse for wild variations in fuel prices across Australia, as calls grow for an independent investigation into the disparity.\n\nDr Jeffreys said new independent sites were being developed in Brisbane, but not fast enough.\n\n\"It's an expensive task getting a new petrol station into the market, and we're just not seeing enough of these sites quickly enough to have a big difference on the average,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the report's release, RACQ has called for market regulation to stamp out unfair and unjustified price hikes.\n\n\"I think we have got to the situation in Brisbane where we do need to consider some sort of intervention and some government regulation,\" Dr Jeffreys said.\n\n\"We are in discussions with the Queensland government, and we're working on the modelling,\" he said.\n\n\"Queensland's capital has consistently been one of the most expensive and unpredictable cities for fuel in the country, and it's clear the current market isn't working in the best interests of motorists.\"",

(ABC Rural: Lydia Burton)\n\nDarwin dragon fruit grower Liza Nguyen said the sector had been seriously impacted by imports, and the financial cost had almost led to her family selling their farm.\n\n\"We did put it up on the market, one farm obviously closed down here in the NT and we're pretty much the only one growing now in the NT,\" she said.\n\n\"It's very difficult for growers to compete with the imported, because they come in [with a] much cheaper price and we can't compete.\n\n\"We've seen it in dragon fruit, it's going to be the same with pomelo.\"\n\nIn 2022 Australian dragon fruit farmers formed their own growers' association due to the rise of overseas imports. (ABC Capricornia: Erin Semmler)\n\nVietnam an important trading partner\n\nIndustry group Citrus Australia last month said Vietnamese pomelo imports posed an \"unacceptable biosecurity risk\" unless strong prevention measures were implemented, but has since softened its stance after meeting with the agriculture department.\n\nChief executive Nathan Hancock said the body had wanted a \"more technical review\" earlier in the process, but was hopeful the message had gotten through.\n\n\"We do feel that the department's listened to our concerns, and we're hoping that they will take on some of our mitigations and recommendations,\" he said.\n\nNathan Hancock says recent meetings with the agriculture department were productive. (Supplied: Citrus Australia)\n\nMr Hancock said he understood growers' concerns about market pressure, but said imports were an inevitable result of Vietnam's status as an important trading partner.\n\n\"The citrus industry is one that benefits a lot from exporting ourselves and being in a free-trade arrangement, we have to take the ups and the downs,\" he said.\n\n\" We're not in a situation where we can oppose importations based on the commercial risk. \"\n\nBiosecurity front of mind\n\nA Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry spokesperson said the government would never compromise on biosecurity, and pomelos from Vietnam would not arrive until import conditions were finalised.\n\n\"The department's independent scientific and technical experts have undertaken a rigorous, science-based assessment on the importation of pomelo from Vietnam,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Australia will only accept measures that manage the biosecurity risk to Australia's appropriate level of protection.\"",

    "text": "Naomi Osaka has revealed a visit to Japan as a 13-year-old and the Williams sisters helped inspire the outfit she wore when she stepped onto court at the Australian Open.\n\nOsaka's entrance to Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday evening will be remembered for some time.\n\nAhead of facing Antonia Ru\u017ei\u0107 in their first-round match, Osaka wore a white hat and veil, matched by flowing pants and an umbrella in the same colour.\n\nOnce the two-time Australian Open champion took off the pants, she showed off a ruffled dress dominated by turquoise, which she wore in her 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 win over Ru\u017ei\u0107.\n\nOsaka's entrance set social media alight, while those inside Rod Laver Arena were left in awe.\n\nDuring her on-court interview following the match, the former world number one said the outfit \u2014 which was \"months in the planning\" alongside designer Robert Wun and Nike \u2014 drew inspiration from jellyfish and butterflies.\n\nButterflies feature as it was a nod to a viral moment from her successful 2021 Australian Open campaign.\n\nLater, 16th seed Osaka \u2014 who was born in the US but represents Japan \u2014 expanded on the inspiration behind her fashion statement.\n\n\"When I was 13, I went to Japan for the first time,\" Osaka told her post-match media conference at Melbourne Park.\n\n\"I went to Harajuku. It felt like people could be themselves with their clothes.\"\n\nNaomi Osaka had full confidence in what she wore onto Rod Laver Arena. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nOsaka also credited Serena and Venus Williams, and Maria Sharapova for their on-court style.\n\n\"I grew up with the GOATs of style \u2014 Serena, Venus, Sharapova,\" Osaka said.\n\n\"People don't talk about her enough, but [also] Bethanie Mattek-Sands, too. She made it work with what she had.\n\n\"I think it all comes down to personality, too. I don't expect someone that's really reserved to freaking put a veil on their head and go out and play their match.\n\n\"I've seen people with bows in their hair. I think like that's always going to be the first step into something.\n\n\"I'm always curious to see what is the next thing.\"\n\n'I almost feel like I'm a Barbie'\n\nNaomi Osaka's fashion statement extended to her warm-up outfit. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nOsaka said her fashion sense reflected the layers of her personality.\n\n\"For me, I feel like when I step on the court, I'm not the 'me' that you're talking to right now,\" she said.\n\n\"I would never yell, 'C'mon', that loud in a normal setting.\n\n\"I almost feel like I'm a Barbie that dresses up and goes on the court and does something.\n\n\"When I come back in the locker room is when I'm like my true quiet Naomi.\"\n\nNaomi Osaka moved through to the second round with her win over Antonia Ru\u017ei\u0107. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nOsaka's outfit divided opinion on social media, but she was adamant she did not worry what other people thought.\n\n\"I realise I'm a little strange because I don't really think I care,\" she said.\n\n\"Like, for me, I just feel like I want to do things that create joy and happiness.\n\n\"Obviously, I really love fashion. That makes me excited to wake up and do the whole walk-on or whatever.\n\n\"It just creates a little bit more joy in that whole match preparation.\"\n\nThe was only one moment of apprehension for Osaka before she entered Rod Laver Arena and it had to do with her umbrella.\n\n\"The scariest thing for me was I didn't know if the umbrella could fit in the tunnel,\" Osaka said.",

(Supplied: Brian Slater)\n\nAlong the way, he has found treasures that have become part of the vehicle.\n\nThe two rear lights were purchased from a trash and treasure market in Adelaide when he was visiting his grandchildren.\n\nHe came across the headlight when he was in Cockburn. It was once used as a spotlight for a kangaroo shooter.\n\nAnd the lock on the back is about 150 years old.

(Supplied: Lee-Fay Low)\n\n\"I encourage people to learn new things because learning is mentally challenging, it's really the element of challenging your brain that will be good for your brain health,\" she said.\n\nProfessor Low said Mr Slater's project was a perfect example of a cognitively challenging activity that was skill-driven and also provided social connections.\n\n\"He probably learnt a whole lot of skills, he might have been using skills he was interested in, I suspect it has given him meaning and purpose and he might have met a bunch of people along the way,\" she said.\n\nEyes on the road\n\nAfter six years of hard work, Mr Slater has created the three-wheeled vehicle of his dreams.\n\n\"I've joined the vintage and veteran motorcycle group in Broken Hill, as a start,\" he said.\n\n\"They've accepted me even though it's not an old bike, but it's built to look like one.\"\n\nBrian Slater does not plan to take the trike out of Broken Hill just yet.

    "text": "The chocolate industry is getting a shake-up with cocoa-free alternatives hitting supermarket shelves.\n\nRecord high prices and a volatile supply market have seen some confectionery manufacturers explore technologies that create lab-grown, fermented and upcycled \"cocoa\".\n\nCocoa prices have been rising since 2021, pushing retail chocolate prices up. (ABC: Lucy Cooper)\n\nThe move has been criticised by the industry in Australia and overseas, which has argued chocolate needs to contain cocoa from the beans of the cacao tree.\n\nA global report released by Rabobank found manufacturers were looking to diversify their ingredient options after cocoa prices surged to unprecedented highs.\n\n\"We saw cocoa prices reach a record high of $11,000 US per ton last year, so about four or five times higher than the historical average,\" Rabobank analyst Paul Joules said.\n\nPaul Joules says food companies are investigating new technologies that could be a substitute for cocoa beans. (Supplied: Rabobank)\n\nNews that the big chocolate makers are considering alternatives to traditional cocoa has been met with criticism from other producers who are passionate about traditional chocolate.\n\n\"It's all about money, it's just business,\" Jessica Pedemont, founder of Chocolate Artisan in Sydney said.\n\nJessica Pedemont believes consumers may be wary of eating a lab-grown cocoa substitute. (Supplied: Jessica Pedemont)\n\nCadbury 'exploring innovations'\n\nAs the second-largest confectionery brand in the world, Cadbury is synonymous with chocolate.\n\nA spokesperson for Cadbury's parent company, Mondelez International, told the ABC it was closely monitoring and selectively exploring innovations emerging across the food system.\n\nThey said this included investigating ways to upcycle parts of the cacao fruit that would otherwise go to waste, alongside early-stage technologies that could complement traditional cocoa supply.\n\nRabobank has found manufacturers are \"moving from niche experiments to strategic initiatives\". (Supplied: Rabobank)\n\nSixty per cent of the world's cocoa is produced in West Africa, a region Mr Joules said had seen supply significantly impacted by tree disease and bad weather.\n\nHe said that had prompted major manufacturers to look at two ways of producing cocoa.\n\n\"Lab-grown cocoa is still in its infancy, but the other alternative is the fermentation process, so transforming plant-based inputs like oats, sunflower seeds, barley \u2014 and converting into chocolate-like ingredients,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Joules warned cocoa-free chocolate did not necessarily mean cheaper prices.\n\n\"You've also got the costs of the other ingredients \u2014 milk, palm oil, sugar, labour costs, the cost of energy,\" he said.\n\n\"To take out one ingredient and replace it with another may not necessarily have a huge impact on the overall pricing.\"\n\nSome in the industry have been critical of the consideration of cocoa alternatives. (ABC: Lucy Cooper)\n\nNestl\u00e9, the world's largest, most diversified food and beverages company, recently had to rename some of their products in the UK because they failed to meet the minimum threshold of cocoa content, and could no longer be called chocolate.\n\nA spokesperson for the company told the ABC it continues to monitor new trends but believes cocoa remains essential to real chocolate.\n\nIndustry caution\n\nOwner of Southern Forests Chocolate in Western Australia's South West Kate Frost said she and her husband would only consider alternatives in the event of a \"global cocoa outage\".\n\nKate Frost says consumers expect chocolate to contain cocoa. (Supplied: Southern Forests Chocolate Company)\n\n\"Chocolate is a desirable product, people purchase chocolate knowing there is cocoa, and if the alternatives don't meet expectations [for the consumer] we wouldn't go down that track,\" Ms Frost said.\n\nThe chocolate maker said they sourced beans from several countries, and recent market volatility had opened opportunities to experiment with cocoa from different regions.\n\n\"I'm quite happy trialling beans from different countries and exploring their unique flavour profiles \u2014 we're currently experimenting with beans from Ecuador and Belize,\" she said.\n\nKate Frost says they have \"ridden out\" the cocoa industry volatility, believing it will lead to a more sustainable product in the long run. (Supplied: Southern Forests Chocolate Company)\n\nMr Joules said fermented cocoa was the most promising alternative that had already landed in some retailers, but taste was a drawback.\n\n\"[Chocolate manufacturers] are struggling to some degree to get it to taste exactly like your typical chocolate bar, there's reports that it can have a bit more of a bitter taste if they haven't quite got the fermentation process right,\" he said.\n\nFounder of Cacao Fiji Arif Kahn said the issue of taste with fermented cocoa was what gave him hope.\n\n\"You cannot replace the taste of cocoa growing in the Fiji islands and the taste impacted by the terroir and that is a key difference,\" he said.\n\nArif Kahn believes lab-grown chocolate and cocoa are unavoidable. (ABC: Lucy Cooper)\n\nConsumers 'looking for purity'\n\nCo-founder of Sydney-based social enterprise South Pacific Cacao Jessica Pedemont said the venture was all about supporting Australia's Pacific neighbours.\n\nMs Pedemont is also the co-founder of Chocolate Artisan, and she said she sourced cacao from Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.\n\n\"I have no doubt [my chocolate is] more costly than what's in a supermarket but they're not the same,\" she said.\n\n\" It is quite a labour-intensive process and I think that needs to be honoured and respected and [we should] educate people why something costs more than something else. \"\n\nJessica Pedemont sources cacao from Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. (Supplied: Jessica Pedemont)\n\nMs Pedemont said she would rather consume chocolate that contained cocoa than a lab-grown substance that had \"never seen the light of day\", and believed consumers wanted the same.\n\n\"They're looking for purity, they're looking for organic, they're looking for fair trade, they're looking for good practice, they're looking for freshness, they want to identify everything on the packaging, authenticity, traceability,\" she said.",

In a strange twist, Baptiste's first-round match was against Taylor Townsend, who Hunter beat in qualifying to make it into the main draw. Townsend got into the draw as a lucky loser after Marketa Vondrousova withdrew due to injury. Gibson's advantage disappears in a flash J By Jon Healy (AAP) After quickly going up a break and 2-0 in the third and deciding set against Diana Shnaider, Australian wildcard Talia Gibson is suddenly down 3-2 with Shnaider serving after surrendering three straight games. The way this match has gone, I wouldn't rule anything out, but that's a rough start for the 21-year-old. Sabalenka closes out Bai to move into third round C By Chris De Silva (Getty) Imperious stuff in the second set from the world No.1 as she easily disposes of Bai 6-3, 6-1. It was a gallant effort from the world No.702, but she didn't have enough in the tank to battle the power of Sabalenka. Sabalenka calls it a \"tricky\" match and mentions how she had to keep her composure when Bai started \"crushing it\" late in the first set. She says she kept telling herself that it was only a matter of time before the tide would turn back her way. That's where Sabalenka has really improved as she's gotten older and more experienced. She's so composed mentally during the highs and lows of any given match. Talia Gibson gets the early break in the decider J By Jon Healy A massive early win for Australian wildcard Talia Gibson, taking a 2-0 lead in the third set against 23rd seed Diana Shnaider. New AO crowd favourite advances to third round J By Jon Healy Court seven erupts as Turkish qualifier Zeynep S\u00f6nmez makes it through to the third round with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Hungary's Anna Bondar. She next faces Yulia Putintseva or Elsa Jacquemot, who just stepped onto court five. Gibson and Shnaider heading to a third set J By Jon Healy (Getty) Brutal stuff for Australian wildcard Talia Gibson, who misses out on three match points at 4-5 and suddenly finds herself off to a deciding third set just a few minutes later. She was so close to taking down 23rd seed Diana Shnaider but now has to flush that from her memory and refocus for the third. One of Gibson's coaches tells her that Shnaider \"doesn't have your motor\" and another reminds her of a gutsy three-hour win over Argentina's Solana Sierra in the third round of Wimbledon qualifying. \"Do it again,\" he says. Sabalenka takes stranglehold of second set C By Chris De Silva The world No.1 has raced out to another quick 2-0 lead courtesy of an early break in the second set. Bai has made Sabalenka work hard for these points though, which is a stark contrast to how things were going at the start of the first set. She's gotten a lot more comfortable as the match has worn on and while she may not possess the power of Sabalenka, her placement on some winners have been excellent. Three match points go begging for Talia Gibson J By Jon Healy (Getty) Sensational defence from Talia Gibson earns her three match points on Diana Shnaider's serve at 4-5, but the Russian 23rd seed fights them all off. She eventually holds for 5-5 in the second set as Gibson badly miscues a down-the-line backhand. And now Shnaider is serving for the set after breaking Gibson thanks to the Aussie's third double fault of the set. Elina Svitolina is the first player through to the third round of the singles J By Jon Healy (Getty) The Ukrainian flag continues to fly at the Australian Open as the 12th seed books her place in the third round with a decisive 7-5, 6-1 win over Polish qualifier Linda Klimovicova. Gutsy Gibson breaks back in second set J By Jon Healy Aussie wildcard Talia Gibson is one game away from knocking out 23rd seed Diana Shnaider after recovering from a break down in the second set. She's rattled off three straight games to get back to 5-4 as Shnaider sprays a drive volley long from the net. That shot suggests to me that Shnaider's feeling the pressure a little. She's also not thrilled with the crowd extended the cheers for Gibson a little too long as she prepares to serve. Sabalenka finally claims first set after struggle C By Chris De Silva What a fascinating set of tennis that was! It was a set of two halves really. Aryna Sabalenka raced out to a 5-0 lead in 16 minutes, but had to slug it out for another 23 minutes before she won the sixth game, eventually winning the set 6-3. Bai incredibly saved SIX separate set points before the world No.1 was able to close it out on the seventh. Bai continues to frustrate Sabalenka C By Chris De Silva Are we seeing the tide turn on Rod Laver Arena? (Getty) Aryna Sabalenka puts her face in her towel as she sits down for a break having failed to serve out the set. Bai holding serve and then breaking the world No.1 to draw to within 5-2. Bai avoids the bagel C By Chris De Silva Bai with a fist pump as she lashes home a forehand winner to win her first game of the match. Sabalenka still well in control though, leading 5-1 in the set and she's looking to serve it out. The crowd once again with the loudest cheer of the match for the Bai winner.

It's Evonne Goolagong Cawley Day at the Australian Open J By Jon Healy Day four is Evonne Goolagong Cawley day at AO26.

(Supplied: Stan) He also chose to have Bai call the toss and I always respect offering the option to the lower-ranked, infinitely less famous player. Bai receives cheers after winning her first point C By Chris De Silva Aryna Sabalenka off to a blistering start against Bai Zhuoxuan on Rod Laver Arena. Sabalenka broke her Chinese opponent's first service game of the match, holding her to love. After nine consecutive Sabalenka points to start the match, Bai wins one courtesy of an unforced error, and the Rod Laver Arena crowd erupts. Nevertheless, Sabalenka is in cruise control out here, currently up 3-0 in the first set. Talia Gibson goes up a set against the 23rd seed J By Jon Healy (Getty) After winning just one game in her only previous grand slam second-round match, Australian wildcard Talia Gibson is now just one set away from progressing after an impressive display in the opener against 23rd seed Diana Shnaider. Gibson powered down four aces and 14 winners as her pace clearly troubled the more experienced Shnaider. Gibson looks incredibly composed considering how rarely she's been on this stage, landing 68 per cent of her first serves with no doubles. Sabalenka is out on Rod Laver Arena for her second round clash C By Chris De Silva The No.1 seed in the women's draw Aryna Sabalenka is out on centre court for her second-round clash. She's facing China's Bai Zhuoxuan. It is the pair's first ever clash and Bai's first time on Rod Laver Arena. When are Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis playing doubles? J By Jon Healy Are Kyrios and kokkinakis still going to play doubles at the Australian open? - Robyn kosmider (AP) Hi Robyn, The 2022 Australian Open men's doubles champions are still on the official draw, listed for a first-round match-up with fellow wildcard pairing Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans. They're not on the schedule for today, so probably expect them tomorrow (the order of play for day five will be revealed this afternoon). Of course, with Kyrgios and Kokkinakis, injuries are always a factor, so we're keeping an eye and ear out for any late withdrawals. Show more posts",

    "text": "\u200b\u200bFor Penrith Regional Gallery director Toby Chapman, who grew up on the NSW South Coast, swimming was a part of everyday life.\n\n\"I've had this personal love and affection for swimming pools since I was a child,\" he tells ABC Arts.\n\nAs an adult, he began to appreciate the municipal pool's valuable role as a civic space serving a cross-section of society.\n\n\"You've got young people and children having swimming lessons, you might have seniors coming in,\" he says.\n\n\"People of all ages and all corners of life come to the same swimming pool.\"\n\nThe public pool is \"a very interesting kind of mix of the full spectrum of the community that you live in\", Chapman says. (Pictured: Penrith pool in the 1960s.) (Supplied: PRG)\n\nBut moving to Western Sydney challenged his understanding of the pool as a democratic space.\n\n\"It must have been January or February, one of those stinking hot Penrith days, 40-plus degrees, and I thought I'd go to a local pool for a swim after work,\" he says.\n\nA quick online search revealed that, much to his surprise, Penrith \u2014 with a population of 225,000 \u2014 had just two public swimming pools.\n\n\"I found [it] really shocking that it could be one of the hottest places in all of Sydney with such little access to public swimming and water,\" he says.\n\nThe realisation that the pool wasn't accessible to all sparked Chapman's interest as a curator.\n\n\"I thought the idea of an exhibition about Australia's preoccupation with swimming could be a way for us to look at our social history,\" he says.\n\n\"Curating and developing the show in Penrith was also a chance to shine a light on what the reality is for communities \u2026 living in Western Sydney, where, spoiler alert, it turns out that access to swimmable water isn't equal for all people.\"\n\nThe result is The Pool Show, Penrith Regional Gallery's summer blockbuster that examines Australian life through the lens of our preoccupation with the swimming pool.\n\nArtist David Capra collaborated with a seniors aqua aerobics class to produce Birthing Things in the Spirit: The Waterbirth, \"a mini-musical\" filmed at Campbelltown Aquatic Centre. (Supplied: PRG/David Capra)\n\nThe liberation of learning to swim\n\nAs a starting point, Penrith Regional Gallery sought loans of a series of major works from its exhibition partner, the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), including David Hockney's Water pouring into swimming pool, Santa Monica (1964) and Ian Fairweather's The Pool (1959).\n\nBut the AGNSW's collection, although a rich visual archive of Australia's history of swimming, had its limitations.\n\n\"[As] we looked at their collection, we realised that not all bodies and not all people were represented in that story,\" Chapman says.\n\n\"The representation of people swimming was largely monocultural. It was very much representative of White Australia.\"\n\nChapman says photographs such as Max Dupain's Olympic Pool (diver), taken at Orange Olympic pool in 1988, offer an idealised representation of Australia's swimming culture. (Supplied: Estate of Max Dupain/Copyright Agency)\n\nTo address this imbalance, Chapman commissioned new works from five artists \u2014 Marian Abboud & the Seed of Hope Collective from Think + Do Tank, Katerina Asistin, Dennis Golding, Mike Hewson and JD Reforma \u2014 to \"challenge or problematise that historical representation\".\n\nOne of those works is Watch the Water, a multimedia work by Abboud, an artist from Western Sydney, documenting the experiences of migrant and refugee women around water.\n\nAbboud says growing up as a first-generation Australian with migrant parents who had no connection with the water, learning to swim as a child was a priority.\n\nHer parents realised that for the beach to be a place of safety rather than danger, their children had to be competent swimmers.\n\n\"We all went to swimming lessons until we were well into adulthood, and now we're really confident in the water,\" she says.\n\nAustralia faces public pool crisis Billions of dollars need to be spent on repairing and replacing hundreds of public pools over the next decade, so what does the future hold for the much-loved sporting and social hubs?\n\nWatch the Water has its origins in Abboud's work with girls at a local high school 20 years ago.\n\n\"A lot of them had never been to the beach because it was too far away, they didn't have access to it,\" Abboud says.\n\n\"[On] one of our excursions, we took them to the women's baths in Coogee [McIver Ladies' Baths] and it pretty much changed their lives. It was this big eye-opener to the world around them that wasn't only a five-kilometre radius [from Western Sydney].\"\n\nIt started Abboud thinking about her community's access to waterways and how to build people's confidence in the water.\n\nShe says the many barriers that prevent some communities from accessing swimming spots, whether the ocean or the public pool \u2014 such as geography, transport and cost, which can be prohibitive \u2014 are often overlooked.\n\n\" It's actually a privilege and a luxury to be able to take your family to the pool. \"\n\nAccess is improving, with Lake Parramatta and Penrith Beach \u2014 known as Pondi \u2014 proving a popular alternative to public pools among swimmers.\n\nFor the women Abboud worked with on Watch the Water, learning to swim and becoming more confident in the water has been liberating.\n\n\"To be able to float in water is the closest to freedom that a lot of the women have felt,\" she says.\n\nRevisiting a pivotal moment in history\n\nWhen Chapman first conceived of the exhibition, he had one artwork in mind: Barred from the baths, Robert Campbell Jnr's 1987 painting commemorating the 1965 Freedom Ride protesting discrimination against Aboriginal people in regional NSW.\n\nThe protests, led by Arrernte and Kalkadoon man and activist Charles Perkins, famously led to the overturning of a ban excluding Aboriginal kids from the Moree swimming pool.\n\n\"[It's an] important social history painting \u2026 looking at a pivotal moment in relatively recent social history,\" Chapman says.\n\nRobert Campbell Jnr, who painted Barred from the baths (1987), grew up in Kempsey, one of the towns visited by the Freedom Ride activists. (Supplied: PGR)\n\nKamilaroi artist Dennis Golding re-examines this history in one of the exhibition's newly commissioned works, Echoing Pathways.\n\nGolding worked with a group of students from Collarenebri, a small town 140 kilometres west of Moree, to create a series of drypoint prints meditating on their experiences of exclusion, 60 years on from the Freedom Ride.\n\nGolding asked the kids if they still felt \"barred from the baths\" \u2014 and the answers they gave were shocking, Chapman says.\n\n\" Many of these young people still experienced either an internalised or a very explicit form of discrimination and segregation. \"\n\nBut the students' work also included stories of survival and resilience.\n\n\"Ultimately, there was a really hopeful tone that the future can be bright,\" Chapman.\n\nGolding also produced a series of ceramic sculptures, echoing the form of lane dividers and etched with the phrase \"we can go to the pool now\", that wind across the gallery wall between the students' prints.\n\n\"[It's an example of] how the new commissions offer an alternative perspective on the historical works in the exhibition,\" Chapman says.\n\nEchoing Pathways \"began by listening to histories of exclusion from public spaces across north-west NSW,\" Golding says. (Supplied: PRG)\n\nFor many, the show has acted as a prompt for them to rethink their relationship with the water.\n\n\"Everybody has a story about a swimming pool \u2026 Some of them are tinged with nostalgia. Some of them are more contemporary,\" Chapman says.\n\n\"But once we start asking these questions, you realise those stories always speak to the complexity of life and an overriding sense that people in our society are good and they do want the best for themselves and for other people as well.\"\n\nThe Pool Show is at Penrith Regional Gallery until February 15.",

The S&P/ASX 200 was down 25.4 points, or 0.3 per cent, just after midday, with eight of 11 industry sectors losing ground. Tuesday was the first session for the US markets to react to the escalation from Trump, as they were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Long-term bond yields in Japan rose to record levels on concerns over the government\u2019s fiscal policy, adding to anxiety in global markets. Trump\u2019s trade policy has roiled markets since the start of his second term. Stocks have sold off on the threat of steep tariffs, then rallied when Trump delays or cancels a tariff, or negotiates a lower rate. Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10 per cent import tax starting in February on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland. The annual combined imports from European Union nations are greater than those from the top two biggest individual importers into the US, Mexico and China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGold prices surged 3.7 per cent and silver prices soared 6.9 per cent.

Companies that focus on consumer staples held up better than most of the market. Colgate-Palmolive rose 1.1 per cent and Campbell\u2019s rose 1.5 per cent.

Got it Share A A A\n\nAdvance Metals has discovered new visible gold mineralisation less than 50m below surface at its Happy Valley prospect in Victoria\u2019s goldfields. A step-out diamond hole intersected the gold in a previously unrecognised quartz vein structure roughly 100m east of the old mine area. The assay results confirmed the zone\u2019s strength, returning a 0.6-metre hit grading a whopping 66.7 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 51m. Stunning visible gold in drilling at Advance Metals\u2019 Happy Valley gold project in the prolific Victorian goldfields. The intercept marks the shallowest gold mineralisation drilled at Happy Valley to date and sits outside any previously mapped lodes. Structural measurements show the new vein trends nearly north-south, closely aligned with the narrow, high-grade reefs that formed the historic mining operations at Happy Valley way back in the mid-to-late 1800\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company says its drilling will continue from a newly established pad further north, designed to test both the fresh structure at depth and extensions of the main Happy Valley lodes. A second diamond rig remains active along strike, targeting regional prospects to the northwest and southeast. Two holes have now been completed at Advance\u2019s nearby Queen of the Hills prospect, with a third hole underway. Assays from these regional holes are expected in early February, with the deeper section of today\u2019s discovery hole due in the coming weeks. The company says the latest discovery is pivotal, providing a key building block to its recent depth extensions at Happy Valley. In November, Advance extended the historic mine at depth with a 3.7-metre hit running 16.6g/t gold, some 140m below the previous deepest known mineralisation, confirming the system remains open at depth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new shallow intercept therefore adds a near-surface layer to the broader Happy Valley trend, which stretches over 13km and hosts multiple historic workings yet to see modern systematic exploration. Advance also holds a trio of high-grade silver-gold projects in Mexico in Yoquivo and Guadalupe y Calvo in Chihuahua and Gavilanes in Durango. Together they carry foreign non-compliant resources of more than 100 million ounces of silver-equivalent, led by Guadalupe y Calvo at 60.6 million ounces. Recent drilling at Yoquivo\u2019s 17.23-million-ounce deposit returned further high-grade extensional results, up to a bonanza 5739g/t silver equivalent. The results appear perfectly timed as both gold and silver prices continue to surge to all-time historic highs. Resampling of thousands of metres of historic core continues to add data to an upgraded JORC-compliant resource estimate, which is targeted for the first quarter of this year. The company remains confident it can squeeze out as much as 200 million ounces of silver from it Mexican portfolio. Advance is absolutely kicking the door in on opposite sides of the globe with its precious metals portfolio. With two rigs still ploughing away in Victoria and a fresh shallow vein grading 66.7g/t gold, Happy Valley just found itself a new dance partner, making sure the punters stay tuned as the music picks up.

Gliding onto centre court with the intensity of an assassin in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill movies, the former world number one appeared to be lost.

Osaka\u2019s purpose became clear as the tendrils on her turquoise tie-dye dress moved in time with gasps from the crowd. After years of tennis WAGs and celebrities in sponsored outfits stealing the spotlight, the 28-year-old had shifted the fashion focus back to the players. Naomi Osaka steps out at the Australian Open wearing an outfit inspired by jellyfish with a touch of butterfly. It was designed by the player, couturier Robert Wun and Nike.

Fabric butterflies on her hat and parasol were callbacks to when the most fashion-forward of insects landed on Osaka\u2019s nose at the Australian Open in 2021.

Got it Share A A A\n\nOn both sides of the Pacific, investors are becoming nervous, with the Japanese bond market crashing in response to its new prime minister\u2019s election promises and US markets tumbling in response to the threat of new tariffs on European exports. The coincidence of the turmoil in two of the world\u2019s key markets comes with the world awash with debt and struggling to come to terms with Donald Trump\u2019s destructive tariff-driven trade and geopolitical strategies. The world is vulnerable to a spike in global bond yields. Markets are getting increasingly nervous. AP In Japan, the catalyst for a meltdown in its bond market, with the yields on its most long-dated bonds hitting record levels, was Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s calling of a snap election on Monday, with an election promise that she would exclude food and beverages from Japan\u2019s 8 per cent consumption tax for two years, at a cost of \u00a55 trillion ($47 billion) a year. For a government with a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 230 per cent, the unfunded pledge was reminiscent of the \u201cLiz Truss moment\u201d in the UK, whose announcement of unfunded tax and spending cuts caused a bond market revolt and earned her the dubious distinction of becoming the shortest-serving British prime minister in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Letters Joining Trump\u2019s board of peace would be futile In the US, the sharemarket slumped more than 2 per cent and bond yields spiked in response to Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose a new 10 per cent tariff of eight European and Nordic countries, with the rate rising to 25 per cent in June if they don\u2019t deliver Greenland to the US. He also threatened France with a 200 per cent tariff on French champagne unless France joins his \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d. Not surprisingly, gold, which has been on a record-breaking tear since Trump regained the presidency and began his trade wars against the rest of the world, hit another record on Tuesday. The surge in bond yields globally (Australian bond yields also rose across the board on Tuesday) is occurring amidst a sea of global debt, with the global debt-to GDP ratio now more than 235 per cent. In the US the ratio is about 125 per cent and in Japan, the world\u2019s most indebted developed economy, about 240 per cent. While they are not alone, the US and Japan \u2013 two of the world\u2019s key economies with two of the world\u2019s most important financial centres \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to a sharp increase in government borrowing costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has shown himself acutely sensitive to movements in the US bond market, backing off his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement after the US bond market plunged and yields spiked. Takaichi, riding a wave of popularity for an agenda that appears to designed to grow and inflate Japan out of a potential debt trap, doesn\u2019t appear as fearful of the bond vigilantes in her market. The cross-currents being created by the movements in bond yields in the US and Japan are complex but potentially significant. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sent bond yields soaring after calling a snap election on Monday, with an election promise that she would exclude food and beverages from Japan\u2019s 8 per cent consumption tax for two years. Bloomberg On Tuesday Japan\u2019s 10-year bond yield jumped 10 basis points to 2.34 per cent. It started the year at 2.06 per cent. The movement in yields on its longer-dated bonds was even more pronounced, with the 30-year bond yield jumping 27 basis points, to 3.4 per cent, and the yield on 40-year bonds surpassing 4 per cent for the first time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the US, the 10-year yield was up 15 basis points, to 4.29 per cent and the 30-year yield 9 basis points to 4.92 per cent. (There\u2019s an inverse relationship between bond prices and yields \u2013 as prices fall the yields rise). Japan\u2019s bond market is dominated by domestic investors, who hold roughly 90 per cent of the bonds, with the central bank, the Bank of Japan, owning more than half of all the bonds after more than a decade of quantitative easing. That probably make it less vulnerable to capital flight than the US market, where there have been several bouts of \u201cSell America\u201d evident since Trump regained office. It also raises the possibility that, when the dust settles and losses on existing trades have been absorbed \u2013 hedge funds have been unwinding their trades and longer-term investors are already in the red \u2013 Japanese domestic investors, who have exported capital ever since their economy plunged into a prolonged and deflationary economic winter after the collapse of its property bubble in the early 1990s, may start repatriating it because of the higher yields and favourable currency hedging costs. That would have major implications for other markets, notably the US, where Japanese entities hold about $US1.2 trillion ($1.8 trillion) of US Treasury securities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith US deficits and debt set to increase as the cost of Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act\u2019s tax cuts hits, any material loss of buying support for US government debt would adversely affect bond prices and yields. America\u2019s creditworthiness is deteriorating and trust in the stability of government and the US legal system is being eroded. Trump has shown, via his intense criticism of the Federal Reserve Board and his continuing attempts to gain influence or control over its rate-setting decisions, how sensitive he is to US interest rate movements. He wants lower rates to respond to the US affordability crisis and to lower the cost of servicing the rising debt levels. While there have been \u201cSell America\u201d moments in response to Trump\u2019s erratic and aggressive policymaking, they haven\u2019t developed into the mass exodus the US is vulnerable to because of its debt and its current account deficit. The US needs to borrow from the rest of the world to sustain growth and standards of living and has been able to because of the primacy of its markets and economy, trust in its courts and other institutions and the key role and power of the US dollar in global economic and financial activity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dollar is weakening against the basket of its major trading partners\u2019 currencies, sliding 0.8 of a percentage point on Tuesday. It has depreciated 9.8 per cent against the basket since Trump\u2019s inauguration, reflecting some level of capital flight. Trump has shown himself acutely sensitive to movements in the US bond market, backing off his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement after the US bond market plunged and yields spiked. AP That could become something more threatening if, as some in Europe are suggesting, European institutions and governments, who between them are, with more than $US12 trillion of US assets, the largest source of foreign investment in the US, start dumping some of those assets. Its unlikely that will occur on a significant scale \u2013 most of them are held by private entities and couldn\u2019t be directed to act \u2013 but even relatively modest sales could have an impact, particularly if this coincided with a withdrawal from the US markets by Japanese investors. It could be happening in modest levels anyway. America\u2019s creditworthiness is deteriorating and trust in the stability of government and the US legal system is being eroded. The decline of the US dollar reflects that deterioration in perceptions of America as a good and safe investment destination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are funds that will shrink their exposure to the US because of the volatility of its political and economic settings and the concentration on a handful of artificial intelligence stocks within its sharemarket. One Danish fund manager, AkademikerPension, which manages around $25 billion, has said \u200dit \u200cwould sell \u200dabout $US100 million of its US \u200dTreasuries holdings \u200cthis month. Related Article Opinion\n\nTrump's White House Appeasing Trump won\u2019t work. Could Europe deploy its \u2018bazooka\u2019 over Greenland? Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist Norway (which Trump seems to get confused with Denmark when demanding the US be allowed to buy Greenland) has a $US2.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund that has more than half its assets in the US, including about $US184 billion of Treasuries. It might, in the current climate, decide it would prefer to lower its exposure. China, once the largest foreign investor in US Treasuries, has been steadily reducing its holdings, shrinking them by 10 per cent, to about $US680 billion, in the past year. Just over a decade ago, it owned about $US1.2 trillion of those securities. It wouldn\u2019t take that much to precipitate a wider sell-off of US debt that would force the Trump administration to rethink strategies that hinge on those countries Trump is targeting simply doing what they\u2019re told under the threat of his tariffs.

Got it Share A A A\n\nWriter Suzie Miller\u2019s dad was meant to be on the West Gate Bridge the day it collapsed in 1970. \u201cThere was another man there with exactly the same name, so we actually got a call saying that it was my dad, but we knew he wasn\u2019t in Melbourne, so we were confused by that, but also stricken. I remember, as a six-year-old, being terrified about the fact that this had happened,\u201d Miller says. Writer Suzie Miller. Michele Aboud The story of that momentous event \u2013 which resulted in the loss of 35 lives and remains Australia\u2019s worst industrial accident \u2013 is revisited in the play West Gate, which premieres at the Melbourne Theatre Company in March. Miller recently joined the MTC board in something of a coup, given she lives between Sydney and London. The opportunity to work with artistic director Anne-Louise Sarks sealed the deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI see her as one of the really great creative leaders in Australia. There are no women running a major theatre company in Sydney. That\u2019s a big part of it for me, wanting to support a woman\u2019s vision,\u201d Miller says. Related Article Arts It was Australia\u2019s worst engineering disaster. Next year, the story is being told in a new way \u201cBecause once you\u2019re up there, you can effect change and you can challenge stereotypes and ways of doing things and bring a fresh approach.\u201d Miller describes Sarks as very savvy, thoughtful and dynamic, and the MTC under her guidance as \u201cstrongly Australian storytelling and very contemporary\u201d. \u201cWe are now pushing boundaries, we are looking at the way a director actually initiates the show. We\u2019re looking at different cultures. We\u2019re looking at a multicultural, multifaceted Australia, in a capsule of time where democracy is under attack. We\u2019re really taking creative risks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving worked with the Griffin Theatre, the Sydney Theatre Company and more recently the National Theatre in London, Miller is known for her bold writing. Despite growing up in Melbourne \u2013 her parents met at the St Moritz ice-skating rink in St Kilda \u2013 she didn\u2019t see MTC shows, or indeed any theatre, when she was young. Her introduction to the genre came later, through St Kilda\u2019s Theatre Works, an organisation her mother championed; it was revelatory. Part of her remit is to help attract younger, more diverse audiences. \u201cI would love to think that there\u2019s some sort of onus on the way that grandparents ... or parents relate to their children, to buy a subscription and ... think I will have a date with a really wonderful young person six times a year.\u201d The wonder and depth of live performance was underlined for Miller during COVID lockdowns when it wasn\u2019t allowed. \u201cHuman beings ache to assemble with each other and to be in each other\u2019s company and to sit shoulder to shoulder with strangers and share an emotional mist,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is what I call theatre.

    "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron says Europe will not give in to bullies or be intimidated, in a scathing criticism of US President Donald Trump's threat to impose steep tariffs if Europe does not let him take over Greenland.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile other European leaders have tried to keep a measured tone to prevent the trans-Atlantic dispute from escalating, Macron came out swinging.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance, and Europe, will not \"passively accept the law of the strongest,\" Macron said at the World Economic Forum in Davos overnight, adding that doing otherwise would lead to their \"vassalisation\".\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, he said, Europe will continue to stand up for territorial sovereignty and the rule of law, despite what he called a shift towards a world without rules. That could include the EU responding with its own steep trade sanctions.\n\n\n\n'Prefer respect to bullies'\n\n\"We do prefer respect to bullies,\" Macron said. \"And we do prefer rule of law to brutality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe delivered the speech after Trump threatened huge tariffs against French wine and champagne and posted private messages from Macron, an unusual breach of diplomatic discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump had already vowed on Saturday to implement a wave of increasing tariffs from 1 February on several European allies, including France, until the US is allowed to acquire Greenland, a step major EU states decried as blackmail.\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington's \"endless accumulation\" of new tariffs is \"fundamentally unacceptable,\" Macron said in Davos, \"even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty\".\n\n\n\nWhat will Europe do?\n\nEU leaders decided over the weekend to convene in Brussels on Thursday evening for an emergency summit on Greenland.\n\n\n\n\n\nTariffs on \u20ac93 billion ($162 billion) worth of US goods, which the EU set aside when Trump agreed a trade deal with the bloc last summer, could snap into place on 6 February.\n\n\n\n\n\nMacron has pushed for the EU also to consider the first use of its Anti-Coercion Instrument, informally known as the \"trade bazooka\", which could limit US access to public tenders or restrict trade in services such as tech platforms. Macron said it was \"crazy\" it had gone that far.\n\n\n\n200 per cent tariff on wines and champagnes\n\nThe US president's relationship with Europe as a whole has deeply soured over his push to wrest sovereignty over the Arctic island from fellow NATO member Denmark, rattling European industry and sending shockwaves through financial markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has also taken offence at France's reluctance to join a proposed Board of Peace, a new international organisation that he would lead. Paris has voiced concern over its impact on the role of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about Macron's stance on the Board of Peace, Trump said late on Monday: \"I'll put a 200 per cent tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join.\"\n\n\n\nTrump publishes private messages\n\nA few hours later, Trump published on his Truth Social account a screenshot of an exchange with Macron.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the exchange, which a source close to Macron said was authentic, Macron told Trump: \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland\" and offered to host a G7 meeting, inviting Russia and others. Neither Trump nor the French source disclosed the date of the messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump also unveiled a private text message from NATO secretary general Mark Rutte, in which he thanked the former Dutch prime minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nRutte, who famously referred to Trump as \"Daddy\" at a NATO summit last year, said in the message that he was \"committed to finding a way forward on Greenland\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Can't wait to see you,\" the NATO chief added.\n\n\n\nNo Trump-Macron meeting planned in Davos\n\nMacron confirmed he had no plans to extend his stay in Davos to Wednesday, when Trump arrives in the Swiss mountain resort town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't have to change my schedule,\" he said, adding that it had long been planned that he would leave in the evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nMacron, who will leave office in mid-2027, has been France's president since 2017. His relationship with Trump has had ups and downs since Trump's first term, with Macron alternating between flattery and tougher rhetoric.\n\n\n\n",

I ask the people of Japan to directly judge whether they can entrust the governance of the nation to Sanae Takaichi.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHer announcement sets the country on a rapid course to elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Takaichi will formally dissolve the parliament on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaigning will officially begin next Wednesday, and then, after just 11 days, Japan will go the polls on the 8th of February.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister is hoping to convert her surging approval rating of 78 per cent into a lower house majority, after her Liberal Democratic Party lost control of both houses of parliament for the first time in its history.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Takaichi's tough talk on immigration, and her refusal to back down from a growing feud with China, resonating particularly well with the party's conservative base - and with some voters reacting to her announcement on the streets of Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJapan is not a country that was established yesterday or today. It is not a country of immigrants. Valuing the people of Japan, I believe, is something Takaichi can do. I hope she does it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with the economy slowing and prices soaring, the number one issue on the minds of most voters is the cost of living.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Takaichi has promised to suspend an eight per cent food levy for the next two years if she is re-elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some voters are already saying that is not enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think a more balanced policy would be necessary. The idea of making the consumption tax on food zero, which has been reported on TV, is something both the ruling and opposition parties are saying. It feels like there are no other options left. Especially with such a short election campaign of just two weeks, I feel like it is not possible to have a calm discussion, and that makes me very uneasy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other big question is whether her popularity as a leader will extend to the party.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LDP has been battling a slush-fund scandal in recent years, and Ms Takaichi has given several of those involved key positions in her government.\n\n\n\n\n\nKanda University Japanese Studies Lecturer Jeffrey Hall says it won't be easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe's doing basically the opposite of reform. She is bringing back scandal-tainted lawmakers, some of whom lost their elections in 2024. She's letting these scandal-tainted politicians have major positions in her party.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other main challenge will be a new centrist alliance formed by Japan's two largest opposition parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat includes Komeito, which was until recently the LDP's junior coalition partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Hall says they will be appealing directly to voters who feel Ms Takaichi is taking the party too far to the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe worst case scenario is that Takaichi loses seats for the LDP, and it's very possible. With the political configuration of opposition parties having changed so much, it's very difficult to predict how a lot of these races are going to go. And one of the most stable voting blocs in the country are the Komeito voters, and she lost them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSanae Takaichi became the country's fifth prime minister in as many years last October.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "United States President Donald Trump could land in hot water over his latest tariff threats, with experts saying his planned import taxes could backfire or drag other countries into painful trade stoushes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump vowed over the weekend to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on EU members Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, along with Britain and Norway , until the US is allowed to buy Greenland.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has threatened to \"100 per cent\" follow through on his threats, as the EU leaders plan to discuss their options at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($161 billion) of US imports that could automatically kick in on February 6 after a six-month suspension.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he would try to meet with Trump on Wednesday adding that a trade dispute was not wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But if we are confronted with tariffs that we consider unreasonable, then we are capable of responding,\" Merz said.\n\n\n\nTim Harcourt, chief economist at the University of Technology Sydney, told SBS News Trump is using the threat of tariffs as an economic bargaining chip in his push to acquire Greenland, a sovereign territory of Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Trump might get more than he wagered for, with experts saying Europe could make good on a proposal to retaliate with its own aggressive economic measures against the US, which would have wide-reaching consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nStock markets in Australia and the US have taken a dip after the latest tariff threats.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMP chief economist Shane Oliver said this shows Australians should take the threatened tariffs seriously as Europe and the US are big export partners with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could impact markets across the globe and cause share prices to fall for Australian investors, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are worries that there'll be a new trade with Europe but it's perhaps not as severe as it was back in April,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We should take it seriously\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I suspect we'll continue to see a knee-jerk negative reaction, but I suspect it will be smaller than what we saw last year,\" he said, referencing Trump's so-called 'Liberation Day' tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, the tariffs targeted almost every country in the world with a 10 per cent baseline US tariff on imported goods , which Australia was exempt from.\n\n\n\nTrump's threat means that EU tariffs, already at 15 per cent, could rise an additional 10 per cent, and a further 25 per cent if a deal is not reached in June, according to the Atlantic Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarcourt said that the tariffs are unlikely to impact Australia directly but could hamper international trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't trade much with those countries compared to Asia,\" he said, \"however, they could impact the global economy if there's retaliation.\"\n\n\n\n'Strike back with force'\n\nWhile European countries have been reluctant to place reciprocal tariffs on the US in the past, that could now be changing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench media are reporting that France's President Emmanuel Macron is calling on leaders to activate the European Union's anti-coercion measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anti-coercion law, which has never been used, would enable the bloc to impose punitive economic measures on a country seeking to force policy change.\n\n\n\n\n\nRasmus S\u00f8ndergaard, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, says it may be Europe's best option to deter Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could look like tariffs directed back at Trump and his allies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The EU has the ability to really strike back with force if they want to,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will hurt European economies, and it will hurt American economies.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE From shopping to superannuation: How a US trade war could impact Australians\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank data, European countries own US$8 trillion ($11.9 trillion) worth of US bonds and equities, more than double any other investor.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould the US continue to threaten Europe with sanctions, the targeted countries could divest in US shares and cause problems for its economy.\n\n\n\nTariffs could backfire\n\nBetashares chief economist David Bassanese said the EU is a major trading partner with the US, and that tariffs towards its members could \"ultimately backfire\" for Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Further large tariffs on major trading partners would only add to the risks facing the US economy \u2014 especially if Europe finally responds with trade retaliation of its own,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Trump is ultimately forced to back down without getting Greenland, it could once again expose many of these threats as hollow, undermining all future negotiations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only could escalating tariffs between the US and EU weaken their respective economies, it could also undermine confidence in global markets.\n\n\n\nOliver said that Trump would be reluctant to make good on the tariff threats, and would likely back down before the deadline and \"cut a deal\", due to how unpopular tariffs are for US voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was elected on the basis of reducing the cost of living, but his tariffs added to it. And so therefore he's under pressure to reduce the cost of living,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump wants to win elections. He doesn't want to go into what would become a new trade war.\"\n\n\n\n",

According to the UN, nearly 80% of young women, aged 18 to 29, are not in education, employment or training. In Part One of this story, we reported on how the situation is getting worse, according to human rights organisations. In Part Two of our Special Report, we look at the Australian response.

The S&P/ASX 200 was down 25.4 points, or 0.3 per cent, just after midday, with eight of 11 industry sectors losing ground. Tuesday was the first session for the US markets to react to the escalation from Trump, as they were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Bloomberg Gold miners jumped after the price of the safe haven asset jumped overnight as anxieties rose in global markets, with Northern Star jumping 2.3 per cent and Evolution Mining up 3 per cent. Iron ore heavyweights are stronger, with Fortescue up 0.6 per cent and BHP gaining 0.8 per cent. Rio Tinto was 2.4 per cent higher as it reported a 7 per cent increase in shipments of the key steel-making material iron ore from its mines in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara in the December quarter, while also beginning operations its long-awaited Simandou iron ore joint venture in the West African nation of Guinea. The big four banks lost ground, with Commonwealth Bank (down 1.7 per cent), Westpac (down 0.8 per cent), ANZ Bank (down 1.4 per cent) and National Australia Bank (down 1 per cent) sharply lower in early afternoon trade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal technology stocks retreated after Wall Street\u2019s Nasdaq dove, with WiseTech and TechnologyOne shedding 2.7 per cent and Xero slumping 4.1 per cent. Related Article Opinion\n\nWorld markets Melting down: Trump sent a warning by markets Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist On Wall Street, the losses were widespread, with nearly every sector losing ground. Major indexes in the US extended losses from last week in what has been a wobbly start to the year. The S&P 500 fell 143.15 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 6,796.86. It is the steepest drop for the benchmark index since October. The Dow Jones fell 526 points, or 1.1 per cent. The Nasdaq composite slumped 1.5 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnology stocks were the heaviest weights on the market.

Lowe\u2019s fell 3.3 per cent, JPMorgan Chase fell 3.1 per cent, and Caterpillar lost 2.5 per cent. European markets and markets in Asia fell. Long-term bond yields in Japan rose to record levels on concerns over the government\u2019s fiscal policy, adding to anxiety in global markets. Trump\u2019s trade policy has roiled markets since the start of his second term. Stocks have sold off on the threat of steep tariffs, then rallied when Trump delays or cancels a tariff, or negotiates a lower rate. Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10 per cent import tax starting in February on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland. The annual combined imports from European Union nations are greater than those from the top two biggest individual importers into the US, Mexico and China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGold prices surged 3.7 per cent and silver prices soared 6.9 per cent.

The cryptocurrency rose above $US96,000 late last week but has dropped back to around $US89,700. Treasury yields were mixed in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.29 per cent from 4.23 per cent late on Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury held steady at 3.60 per cent from late Friday. Companies that focus on consumer staples held up better than most of the market. Colgate-Palmolive rose 1.1 per cent and Campbell\u2019s rose 1.5 per cent. The price of US crude oil rose 1.5 per cent to $US60.34 per barrel. The price of Brent crude, the international standard, rose 1.5 per cent to $US64.92.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump linked his aggressive stance on Greenland to last year\u2019s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, telling Norway\u2019s prime minister that he no longer felt \u201can obligation to think purely of Peace,\u201d in a text message released Monday. Trump\u2019s message to Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re appeared to ratchet up a standoff between Washington and its closest allies over his threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO member Denmark.

Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist Trump\u2019s threats have sparked outrage and a flurry of diplomatic activity across Europe, as leaders consider possible countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs and the first-ever use of the European Union\u2019s anti-coercion instrument. The trade and political conflict with Europe is heating up just as world leaders meet at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland this week. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the new tariff threat \u201cis clearly an overhang on the conference,\u201d but that it would likely simmer over time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur view is just like over the last year the bark will be worse than the bite on this issue and tariff threats as negotiations take place and tensions ultimately calm down between Trump and EU leaders,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.

It is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure for inflation.

Got it Share A A A\n\nAdvance Metals has discovered new visible gold mineralisation less than 50m below surface at its Happy Valley prospect in Victoria\u2019s goldfields. A step-out diamond hole intersected the gold in a previously unrecognised quartz vein structure roughly 100m east of the old mine area. The assay results confirmed the zone\u2019s strength, returning a 0.6-metre hit grading a whopping 66.7 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 51m. Stunning visible gold in drilling at Advance Metals\u2019 Happy Valley gold project in the prolific Victorian goldfields. The intercept marks the shallowest gold mineralisation drilled at Happy Valley to date and sits outside any previously mapped lodes. Structural measurements show the new vein trends nearly north-south, closely aligned with the narrow, high-grade reefs that formed the historic mining operations at Happy Valley way back in the mid-to-late 1800\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company says its drilling will continue from a newly established pad further north, designed to test both the fresh structure at depth and extensions of the main Happy Valley lodes. A second diamond rig remains active along strike, targeting regional prospects to the northwest and southeast. Two holes have now been completed at Advance\u2019s nearby Queen of the Hills prospect, with a third hole underway. Assays from these regional holes are expected in early February, with the deeper section of today\u2019s discovery hole due in the coming weeks. The company says the latest discovery is pivotal, providing a key building block to its recent depth extensions at Happy Valley. In November, Advance extended the historic mine at depth with a 3.7-metre hit running 16.6g/t gold, some 140m below the previous deepest known mineralisation, confirming the system remains open at depth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new shallow intercept therefore adds a near-surface layer to the broader Happy Valley trend, which stretches over 13km and hosts multiple historic workings yet to see modern systematic exploration. Advance also holds a trio of high-grade silver-gold projects in Mexico in Yoquivo and Guadalupe y Calvo in Chihuahua and Gavilanes in Durango. Together they carry foreign non-compliant resources of more than 100 million ounces of silver-equivalent, led by Guadalupe y Calvo at 60.6 million ounces. Recent drilling at Yoquivo\u2019s 17.23-million-ounce deposit returned further high-grade extensional results, up to a bonanza 5739g/t silver equivalent. The results appear perfectly timed as both gold and silver prices continue to surge to all-time historic highs. Resampling of thousands of metres of historic core continues to add data to an upgraded JORC-compliant resource estimate, which is targeted for the first quarter of this year. The company remains confident it can squeeze out as much as 200 million ounces of silver from it Mexican portfolio. Advance is absolutely kicking the door in on opposite sides of the globe with its precious metals portfolio. With two rigs still ploughing away in Victoria and a fresh shallow vein grading 66.7g/t gold, Happy Valley just found itself a new dance partner, making sure the punters stay tuned as the music picks up.

Got it Share A A A\n\nWhen Naomi Osaka walked into Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open wearing a floor-length jellyfish-inspired outfit and hat, there was a seismic shift in tennis fashion. Gliding onto centre court with the intensity of an assassin in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill movies, the former world number one appeared to be lost. The Melbourne Cup was two months ago and a hat with a veil, pleated mini-skirt and wide-legged pants with a matching parasol would even raise micro-bladed eyebrows in the fashion free-for-all in the Birdcage at Flemington Racecourse. Osaka\u2019s purpose became clear as the tendrils on her turquoise tie-dye dress moved in time with gasps from the crowd. After years of tennis WAGs and celebrities in sponsored outfits stealing the spotlight, the 28-year-old had shifted the fashion focus back to the players. Naomi Osaka steps out at the Australian Open wearing an outfit inspired by jellyfish with a touch of butterfly. It was designed by the player, couturier Robert Wun and Nike. Getty Images \u201cSo much of the time, other people get to write our stories for us,\u201d Osaka told US Vogue. \u201cThis felt like a moment where I could write a little bit of my own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe arresting outfit, designed by Osaka with Hong Kong-born, London-based designer Robert Wun and her sponsor Nike, was crammed with meaning. Fabric butterflies on her hat and parasol were callbacks to when the most fashion-forward of insects landed on Osaka\u2019s nose at the Australian Open in 2021. The vivid ruffles on her official Nike kit referenced jellyfish, which delight Osaka\u2019s two-year-old daughter Shai.

I just want to leave an impact.\u201d Osaka and Gauff are shifting the needle of tennis style. At recent AO tournaments, influencers such as Morgan Riddle and Paige Lorenze (partners of players Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul respectively) have stolen fashion headlines.

Got it Share A A A\n\nOn both sides of the Pacific, investors are becoming nervous, with the Japanese bond market crashing in response to its new prime minister\u2019s election promises and US markets tumbling in response to the threat of new tariffs on European exports. The coincidence of the turmoil in two of the world\u2019s key markets comes with the world awash with debt and struggling to come to terms with Donald Trump\u2019s destructive tariff-driven trade and geopolitical strategies. The world is vulnerable to a spike in global bond yields. Markets are getting increasingly nervous. AP In Japan, the catalyst for a meltdown in its bond market, with the yields on its most long-dated bonds hitting record levels, was Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s calling of a snap election on Monday, with an election promise that she would exclude food and beverages from Japan\u2019s 8 per cent consumption tax for two years, at a cost of \u00a55 trillion ($47 billion) a year. For a government with a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 230 per cent, the unfunded pledge was reminiscent of the \u201cLiz Truss moment\u201d in the UK, whose announcement of unfunded tax and spending cuts caused a bond market revolt and earned her the dubious distinction of becoming the shortest-serving British prime minister in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Letters Joining Trump\u2019s board of peace would be futile In the US, the sharemarket slumped more than 2 per cent and bond yields spiked in response to Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose a new 10 per cent tariff of eight European and Nordic countries, with the rate rising to 25 per cent in June if they don\u2019t deliver Greenland to the US. He also threatened France with a 200 per cent tariff on French champagne unless France joins his \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d. Not surprisingly, gold, which has been on a record-breaking tear since Trump regained the presidency and began his trade wars against the rest of the world, hit another record on Tuesday. The surge in bond yields globally (Australian bond yields also rose across the board on Tuesday) is occurring amidst a sea of global debt, with the global debt-to GDP ratio now more than 235 per cent. In the US the ratio is about 125 per cent and in Japan, the world\u2019s most indebted developed economy, about 240 per cent. While they are not alone, the US and Japan \u2013 two of the world\u2019s key economies with two of the world\u2019s most important financial centres \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to a sharp increase in government borrowing costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has shown himself acutely sensitive to movements in the US bond market, backing off his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement after the US bond market plunged and yields spiked. Takaichi, riding a wave of popularity for an agenda that appears to designed to grow and inflate Japan out of a potential debt trap, doesn\u2019t appear as fearful of the bond vigilantes in her market. The cross-currents being created by the movements in bond yields in the US and Japan are complex but potentially significant. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sent bond yields soaring after calling a snap election on Monday, with an election promise that she would exclude food and beverages from Japan\u2019s 8 per cent consumption tax for two years. Bloomberg On Tuesday Japan\u2019s 10-year bond yield jumped 10 basis points to 2.34 per cent. It started the year at 2.06 per cent. The movement in yields on its longer-dated bonds was even more pronounced, with the 30-year bond yield jumping 27 basis points, to 3.4 per cent, and the yield on 40-year bonds surpassing 4 per cent for the first time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the US, the 10-year yield was up 15 basis points, to 4.29 per cent and the 30-year yield 9 basis points to 4.92 per cent. (There\u2019s an inverse relationship between bond prices and yields \u2013 as prices fall the yields rise). Japan\u2019s bond market is dominated by domestic investors, who hold roughly 90 per cent of the bonds, with the central bank, the Bank of Japan, owning more than half of all the bonds after more than a decade of quantitative easing. That probably make it less vulnerable to capital flight than the US market, where there have been several bouts of \u201cSell America\u201d evident since Trump regained office. It also raises the possibility that, when the dust settles and losses on existing trades have been absorbed \u2013 hedge funds have been unwinding their trades and longer-term investors are already in the red \u2013 Japanese domestic investors, who have exported capital ever since their economy plunged into a prolonged and deflationary economic winter after the collapse of its property bubble in the early 1990s, may start repatriating it because of the higher yields and favourable currency hedging costs. That would have major implications for other markets, notably the US, where Japanese entities hold about $US1.2 trillion ($1.8 trillion) of US Treasury securities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith US deficits and debt set to increase as the cost of Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act\u2019s tax cuts hits, any material loss of buying support for US government debt would adversely affect bond prices and yields. America\u2019s creditworthiness is deteriorating and trust in the stability of government and the US legal system is being eroded. Trump has shown, via his intense criticism of the Federal Reserve Board and his continuing attempts to gain influence or control over its rate-setting decisions, how sensitive he is to US interest rate movements. He wants lower rates to respond to the US affordability crisis and to lower the cost of servicing the rising debt levels. While there have been \u201cSell America\u201d moments in response to Trump\u2019s erratic and aggressive policymaking, they haven\u2019t developed into the mass exodus the US is vulnerable to because of its debt and its current account deficit. The US needs to borrow from the rest of the world to sustain growth and standards of living and has been able to because of the primacy of its markets and economy, trust in its courts and other institutions and the key role and power of the US dollar in global economic and financial activity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dollar is weakening against the basket of its major trading partners\u2019 currencies, sliding 0.8 of a percentage point on Tuesday. It has depreciated 9.8 per cent against the basket since Trump\u2019s inauguration, reflecting some level of capital flight. Trump has shown himself acutely sensitive to movements in the US bond market, backing off his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement after the US bond market plunged and yields spiked. AP That could become something more threatening if, as some in Europe are suggesting, European institutions and governments, who between them are, with more than $US12 trillion of US assets, the largest source of foreign investment in the US, start dumping some of those assets. Its unlikely that will occur on a significant scale \u2013 most of them are held by private entities and couldn\u2019t be directed to act \u2013 but even relatively modest sales could have an impact, particularly if this coincided with a withdrawal from the US markets by Japanese investors. It could be happening in modest levels anyway. America\u2019s creditworthiness is deteriorating and trust in the stability of government and the US legal system is being eroded. The decline of the US dollar reflects that deterioration in perceptions of America as a good and safe investment destination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are funds that will shrink their exposure to the US because of the volatility of its political and economic settings and the concentration on a handful of artificial intelligence stocks within its sharemarket. One Danish fund manager, AkademikerPension, which manages around $25 billion, has said \u200dit \u200cwould sell \u200dabout $US100 million of its US \u200dTreasuries holdings \u200cthis month. Related Article Opinion\n\nTrump's White House Appeasing Trump won\u2019t work. Could Europe deploy its \u2018bazooka\u2019 over Greenland? Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist Norway (which Trump seems to get confused with Denmark when demanding the US be allowed to buy Greenland) has a $US2.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund that has more than half its assets in the US, including about $US184 billion of Treasuries. It might, in the current climate, decide it would prefer to lower its exposure. China, once the largest foreign investor in US Treasuries, has been steadily reducing its holdings, shrinking them by 10 per cent, to about $US680 billion, in the past year. Just over a decade ago, it owned about $US1.2 trillion of those securities. It wouldn\u2019t take that much to precipitate a wider sell-off of US debt that would force the Trump administration to rethink strategies that hinge on those countries Trump is targeting simply doing what they\u2019re told under the threat of his tariffs.

Got it Share A A A\n\nWriter Suzie Miller\u2019s dad was meant to be on the West Gate Bridge the day it collapsed in 1970. \u201cThere was another man there with exactly the same name, so we actually got a call saying that it was my dad, but we knew he wasn\u2019t in Melbourne, so we were confused by that, but also stricken. I remember, as a six-year-old, being terrified about the fact that this had happened,\u201d Miller says. Writer Suzie Miller. Michele Aboud The story of that momentous event \u2013 which resulted in the loss of 35 lives and remains Australia\u2019s worst industrial accident \u2013 is revisited in the play West Gate, which premieres at the Melbourne Theatre Company in March. Miller recently joined the MTC board in something of a coup, given she lives between Sydney and London. The opportunity to work with artistic director Anne-Louise Sarks sealed the deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI see her as one of the really great creative leaders in Australia. There are no women running a major theatre company in Sydney. That\u2019s a big part of it for me, wanting to support a woman\u2019s vision,\u201d Miller says. Related Article Arts It was Australia\u2019s worst engineering disaster. Next year, the story is being told in a new way \u201cBecause once you\u2019re up there, you can effect change and you can challenge stereotypes and ways of doing things and bring a fresh approach.\u201d Miller describes Sarks as very savvy, thoughtful and dynamic, and the MTC under her guidance as \u201cstrongly Australian storytelling and very contemporary\u201d. \u201cWe are now pushing boundaries, we are looking at the way a director actually initiates the show. We\u2019re looking at different cultures. We\u2019re looking at a multicultural, multifaceted Australia, in a capsule of time where democracy is under attack. We\u2019re really taking creative risks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving worked with the Griffin Theatre, the Sydney Theatre Company and more recently the National Theatre in London, Miller is known for her bold writing. Despite growing up in Melbourne \u2013 her parents met at the St Moritz ice-skating rink in St Kilda \u2013 she didn\u2019t see MTC shows, or indeed any theatre, when she was young. Her introduction to the genre came later, through St Kilda\u2019s Theatre Works, an organisation her mother championed; it was revelatory. Part of her remit is to help attract younger, more diverse audiences. \u201cI would love to think that there\u2019s some sort of onus on the way that grandparents ... or parents relate to their children, to buy a subscription and ... think I will have a date with a really wonderful young person six times a year.\u201d The wonder and depth of live performance was underlined for Miller during COVID lockdowns when it wasn\u2019t allowed. \u201cHuman beings ache to assemble with each other and to be in each other\u2019s company and to sit shoulder to shoulder with strangers and share an emotional mist,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is what I call theatre. It is quite an astonishing experience\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWest Gate is at the MTC from March 10. The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.
