    "text": "President Donald Trump said he's open to hiking taxes on wealthy Americans to help pay for Republicans' sweeping tax and spending cuts package, but the idea remains hotly contested among GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn a Truth Social post Friday morning, Trump said that he would \"graciously accept\" even a \"TINY\" tax increase on the rich, while acknowledging that it could bring political risks for Republicans.\n\nHouse GOP lawmakers have been struggling to find $US1.5 trillion ($2.3 trillion) in spending cuts to help offset trillions of dollars of tax reductions.\n\nIn a Truth Social post Friday morning, Trump said that he would \"graciously accept\" even a \"TINY\" tax increase on the rich. (CNN)\n\n\"The problem with even a 'TINY' tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, 'Read my lips,' the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election.\n\n\"NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!\" he continued.\n\nTrump also mentioned the possibility of letting tax cuts expire on top earners \u2013 targeting individuals who earn at least $US2.5 million ($3.8 million) or couples that make at least $US5 million ($7.7 million) \u2014 in a call with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, a Republican source familiar with the matter told CNN's Dana Bash.\n\nThe White House has made the suggestion to Congress with the thought that not only would it help achieve much needed offsets, it could also help wipe away Democrats' argument about tax cuts for the rich, the source familiar said.\n\nTrump also mentioned the possibility of letting tax cuts expire on top earners \u2013 targeting individuals who earn at least $US2.5 million. (Bloomberg)\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has indicated that he supports raising taxes on the wealthy, even though throughout last year's presidential campaign, he repeatedly promised to cut their taxes.\n\nThe president recently told Time magazine, \"I actually love the concept,\" when asked about a proposal circulating to raise taxes for those earning more than $US1 million ($1.5 million) a year.\n\nThe idea, however, is not being warmly embraced among the House GOP and is far from guaranteed to make it into the president's final \"one big beautiful\" bill, which aims to make permanent the sweeping Trump 2017 tax cuts and incorporate the president's campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and certain other income.\n\nJust extending the 2017 individual tax provisions \u2013 which expire at the end of this year \u2013 could cost more than $US4 trillion ($6.2 trillion).\n\nRepublican lawmakers are also fractured on how deeply they'd have to cut spending \u2013 including on Medicaid and food stamps \u2013 to meet their targets.\n\nWithin the House Ways and Means Committee, members have discussed two ideas.\n\nOne is to let the tax breaks for the richest Americans expire, returning their top income tax rate to 39.6 per cent \u2013 which is what it was before Trump's 2017 tax overhaul \u2013 from the current 37 per cent.\n\nREAD MORE: Music megastar spotted among crowds celebrating new pope\n\nThe president recently told Time magazine, \"I actually love the concept,\" when asked about a proposal circulating to raise taxes for those earning more than $US1 million. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nThis has drawn some criticism, however, as some Republicans fear it could impact small business owners.\n\nBut it could hit roughly 1.5 million households and cut about $US409 billion ($636 billion) of the cost, as well as greatly limit potential economic growth from making the tax cuts permanent, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank.\n\nAnother idea is to create a brand-new tax bracket for the wealthy.\n\nThe proposal, though limited in scope, could contribute to offsetting costly tax provisions, such as restoring the state and local tax deduction \u2013 known as SALT \u2013 that has become another flashpoint in Congress' tax debate.\n\nThe new tax bracket would raise about $US59.3 billion ($92 billion) over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nAnd it would affect between 150,000 and 200,000 households and would have a much smaller dampening effect on the package's economic growth potential.\n\nDespite Trump's apparent openness to raising taxes on the wealthy, his economic adviser said Friday that the president \"is not a strong advocate\" of the idea. (Bloomberg)\n\nLevying a higher income tax rate on the very wealthiest of Americans would raise less money because much of that group's earnings come from dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates, said Garrett Watson, the foundation's director of policy analysis.\n\nAlso, there are much fewer of them.\n\nOne of the considerations for Republicans is what the goal of such a provision would be \u2013 to limit how much of the benefit is going to the rich or to raise more money to offset other tax cuts, Watson said.\n\nDespite Trump's apparent openness to raising taxes on the wealthy, his economic adviser said Friday that the president \"is not a strong advocate\" of the idea.\n\nAsked whether Trump is seriously considering taxing the rich to pay for his budget bill, National Economic Director Kevin Hassett said: \"The president is not a strong advocate of that, but he is a strong advocate of many things like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and nice treatment for auto loans.\"\n\n\"He has cited his priorities, and he understands that in the end, the final bill will include some priorities of members of the House of the Senate.\n\nThat's how the democratic process works, and that's really what this conversation is about.\"\n\nWhen asked how the White House expects to pay for the bill Hassett argued Congress has already identified clear areas for cuts. (AP)\n\nWhen asked how the White House expects to pay for the bill, given a number of its stated priorities are expensive, Hassett argued Congress has already identified clear areas for cuts, without detailing what they are and whether they are achievable.\n\n\"Well, the budget rules in the House and the Senate are very clearly identified that include spending cuts and so on, and they don't include dynamic scores,\" he told CNN .\n\n\"And so in the fullest of time with the spending cuts that we're achieving ,and the dynamic score of the tax bill, we're highly confident that we're going to reduce the deficit that make bond markets celebrate.\"\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith is expected to meet with Trump at the White House on Friday, and Hassett earlier told CNBC that he expects Smith will outline the House's schedule for the tax bill at some point during the day.\n\nHassett has been meeting almost weekly with Johnson, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others regarding Congress' budget.",

    "text": "Pope Leo XIV, history's first US-born pontiff, said on Friday that his election was both a cross to bear and a blessing as he celebrated his first Mass as the head of the Catholic Church.\n\nLeo spoke off-the-cuff in English in the Sistine Chapel to the cardinals who elected him to follow in the footsteps of Pope Francis , who put a commitment to social justice at the core of his papacy.\n\nHe acknowledged the great responsibility they had placed on him before delivering a brief but dense homily on the need to joyfully spread Christianity in a world that often mocks it.\n\nNewly elected Pope Leo XIV concelebrates Mass with the College of Cardinals inside the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican the day after his election as 267th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, Friday, May 9, 2025. (Vatican Media via AP)\n\n\"You have called me to carry that cross and to be blessed with that mission, and I know I can rely on each and every one of you to walk with me as we continue as a church, as a community, as friends of Jesus, as believers, to announce the good news, to announce the Gospel,\" he said.\n\nIt was in the same frescoed chapel that Leo, the Chicago-born Augustinian missionary Robert Prevost, was elected on Thursday afternoon as the 267th pope, overcoming the traditional taboo against a pontiff from the United States because of the secular power the country wields.\n\nLeo will be formally installed as pope at a Mass on May 18, the Vatican said Friday, and will preside over his first general audience May 21.\n\nA Mass that may suggest his priorities\n\nTwo women delivered the readings of Scripture at the start of the Mass, perhaps an indication of Leo's intention to continue Francis' focus on expanding women's role in the church. As a cardinal, Leo put into practice one of Francis' most revolutionary reforms by having three women serve on the Vatican board that vets bishop nominations.\n\nSpeaking in near-perfect Italian, Leo lamented that the Christian faith in many parts of the world is \"considered absurd,\" mocked or opposed in the face of temptations such as money, success and power. He complained that in many places Jesus is misunderstood, \"reduced to a kind of charismatic leader or superman.\"\n\nNewly elected Pope Leo XIV, second from left, concelebrates Mass with the College of Cardinals inside the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican the day after his election as 267th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, Friday, May 9, 2025 (Vatican Media via AP)\n\n\"This is true not only among non-believers but also among many baptised Christians, who thus end up living, at this level, in a state of practical atheism,\" he said.\n\n\"A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society.\"\n\nThe cardinals applauded as the Mass concluded. Leo was seen wearing simple black shoes \u2014 eschewing, as Francis did, the red loafers of the papacy preferred by some traditionalist popes.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Vatican said Leo had asked all Vatican leaders, who technically lost their jobs when Francis died on April 21, to remain in their posts until he decides definitively on whether to confirm them.\n\nFrancis had his eye on the new pope\n\nFrancis, the first Latin American pope, clearly had his eye on Prevost and in many ways saw him as his heir apparent. He sent Prevost, who had spent years as a missionary in Peru, to take over a complicated diocese there in 2014.\n\nFrancis brought Prevost to the Vatican in 2023 to head of the Vatican's powerful Dicastery for Bishops, which vets bishop nominations around the world and is one of the most important jobs in church governance.\n\nNewly elected Pope Leo XIV, seated at the back left, concelebrates Mass with the College of Cardinals inside the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican the day after his election as 267th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, Friday, May 9, 2025 (Vatican Media via AP)\n\nSince arriving in Rome, Prevost had kept a low public profile but was well known to the men who count, and respected by those who worked with him.\n\n\"Even the bishops of Peru called him the saint, the saint of the north, and he had time for everyone,\" said the Rev. Alexander Lam, an Augustinian friar from Peru who knows the new pope.\n\nAn Augustinian pope\n\nThe last pope to take the name Leo was an Italian who led the church from 1878 to 1903. Leo XIII softened the church's confrontational stance toward modernity, especially science and politics, and laid the foundation for modern Catholic social thought. His most famous encyclical \u2014 a high-level papal teaching \u2014 addressed workers' rights and capitalism at the beginning of the industrial revolution and was highlighted by the Vatican in explaining the new pope's choice of name.\n\nWhile Vatican News said Leo XIV is the first Augustinian pope, the previous Leo had close ties to the order: He rebuilt an ancient Augustinian church and convent near his hometown of Carpineto, outside Rome, that is still in use by the order today.\n\nVatican watchers said Prevost's decision to name himself Leo was particularly significant given the Leo XIII's legacy of social justice and reform, suggesting continuity with some of Francis' chief concerns. Specifically, Leo cited one of Francis' key priorities of making the Catholic Church more attentive to lay people and inclusive.\n\n\"He is continuing a lot of Francis' ministry,'' said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, the chair of religious studies at Manhattan University in the Bronx. She added that his election could send a message to the US church, which has been badly divided between conservatives and progressives, with much of the opposition to Francis coming from there.\n\nMackenzie Magas and Kaylee Mellentine from Missouri, pose for a photo with a newspaper showing the new Pope Leo XIV on the front page, in front of the St. Peter Basilica at the Vatican, Friday, May 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\n\n\"I think it is going to be exciting to see a different kind of American Catholicism in Rome,'' Imperatori-Lee said.\n\nLeo said in a 2023 interview with Vatican News that the polarisation in the church was a wound that needed to be healed.\n\n\"Divisions and polemics in the church do not help anything. We bishops especially must accelerate this movement towards unity, towards communion in the church,\" he said.\n\nLeo's brother, John Prevost, was so shocked that his brother had been elected pope that he missed several phone calls from Leo during an interview on Thursday with The Associated Press.\n\nJohn Prevost described his brother, a fan of Wordle, as being very concerned for the poor and those who don't have a voice. He said he expects him to be a \"second Pope Francis.\"\n\n\"He's not going to be real far left and he's not going to be real far right,\" he added. \"Kind of right down the middle.\"\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIn his first hours as pope, Leo went back to his old apartment in the Sant'Uffizio Palace to see colleagues, according to selfies posted to social media. Vatican Media also showed him in the moments after his election praying in the Pauline Chapel before emerging on the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica to greet Rome and the world.\n\nOn Sunday, he is set to deliver his first noon blessing from the loggia and attend an audience with the media on Monday in the Vatican auditorium.",

(Getty Images: Daniel Pockett)\n\n\"This decision made by the Melbourne Storm board demonstrated a lack of respect and cultural sensitivity towards Aboriginal people and communities,\" VAHS said in a letter to Storm chief executive Justin Rodski.\n\n\"Such an action is inconsistent with our values of respect, cultural integrity and cultural safety. The decision has initiated poor well-being, including feelings of sadness and anger among our community and stakeholders.\"\n\nAunty Joy told Anzac Day Welcome to Country 'inappropriate' Photo shows Headshot of Aunty Joy wearing classes and a possum fur coat. Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin says she does not know if she could work with Melbourne Storm again after the NRL club cancelled her Welcome to Country ceremony on Anzac Day.\n\nAfter it became clear that the Welcome to Country had not been held before the Anzac Day game despite Aunty Joy being at the ground to deliver the address, the Storm said the club's \"board had not approved for it to be held on Anzac Day\".\n\nIt came hours after Bunurong and Gunditjmara man Uncle Mark Brown was booed and heckled by members of the crowd at the dawn service at Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance.\n\nThe Storm said its decision was not related to the booing earlier in the day, but Aunty Joy said she was told it was.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe club chalked the decision up to a miscommunication over whether the ceremony had been approved to go ahead and chairman Matt Tripp told Nine: \"Once we understood the programming from management, we gave the green light to progress. By then, it was understandably too late for those who had already been informed of our earlier decision.\"\n\nThe Storm have held smoking ceremonies, traditional Aboriginal and M\u0101ori dances and numerous Welcomes to Country before games alongside the commemoration of the nations' military history at Anzac Day clashes in previous years.\n\nThe Storm officially partnered with Deadly Choices and VAHS in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, VAHS chief executive Michael Graham said the organisation was \"proud to be associated with the Melbourne Storm based on the club's own strong ties to the Aboriginal community\".\n\nThe Storm had a Welcome to Country before the 2021 Anzac Day game.

(ABC Great Southern: Rosemary Murphy)\n\nShe said, at first, it was difficult trying to decide whether to tell the story to the wider community.\n\n\"Then I started to do more and more and see the illustration from the kids and hearing the story they were asking, 'What did Sammy do?'\n\n\"It brought joy to your heart and you knew that you were doing the right thing.\n\n\" It's just one of those stories that you know when the right time is to tell it. \"\n\nYoung illustrators\n\nA group of primary school students from Mount Barker Community College illustrated the books for the project.\n\nMount Barker Community College students illustrated the books.

(ABC Great Southern: Rosemary Murphy)\n\n\"When I was writing the book he was four years old and he was slowly starting to read,\" he said.\n\n\" I want him and his generation to have the ability to read our language and speak it fluently to preserve our culture. \"\n\nNicole Selesnew from the Shire of Plantagenet, which includes Mount Barker, was one of the main organisers of the project.\n\nShe said including an audio recording in both languages with each of the books was important to assist parents who wanted to help their children with their reading.\n\n\"We had an opportunity to talk to a Hazara family and they said that for their parents to read to the kids it was quite intimidating because not a lot of the parents could read English very well, so that's sort of when the ideas started,'\" Ms Selesnew said.\n\nThe Shire of Plantagenet has a population of approximately 5,700 people. About 4.5 per cent are part of the Hazara community.\n\nRhonda Oliver from Curtin University's school of education said it was great initiative.\n\n\"To foster cultural understanding across all kids, regardless of background, to see that we do have other ways of being and knowing and doing,\" Professor Oliver said.\n\n\"It's really good for the kids whose language background it is because it makes them feel good about who they are and and self-identity is really important for academic success.\"",

(ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nHulett campaigned heavily on gas, saying the issue she would have been \"raging about first\", had she been elected, was Woodside's application to extend the life of its North West Shelf project in the Pilbara.\n\nThe company wants it to continue operating until 2070, but climate groups say the project will emit billions of tonnes of pollution over its lifetime and jeopardise global efforts to reach net zero.\n\nCrunch time for North West Shelf\n\nAs it stands, whoever is the next federal environment minister will have until the end of the month to decide on the application.\n\nThe WA government approved it last year with some conditions, including monitoring air quality and reviewing emissions reduction measures.\n\nA decision on whether to extend the life of the North West Shelf gas project is expected by the end of May.

(Getty Images: Brendon Thorne)\n\nBut since those London Games, women's wheelchair basketball in Australia has faced an uphill battle; the team missed qualification for Rio and Paris.\n\nDel Toso was part of the team that missed out on Rio in 2016, and as devastating as that was, it seemed to signal a series of ongoing issues for the sport.\n\nDel Toso believes women's wheelchair basketball dropped off the Australian delegation's priority list with the onset of the pandemic.\n\n\"The priority for women's wheelchair basketball maybe wasn't there,\" she said.\n\nAnd she still believes this is the case.\n\nDel Toso is concerned the sport won't have enough support for the Gliders to qualify for the upcoming Brisbane Games.\n\n\"My goal is that we're there, front and centre. And that we're capable of medalling,\" Del Toso said.\n\n\"It would destroy our program when it comes to 2032, if we don't feature.\"\n\nA lack of encouragement and an empty pipeline\n\nCurrent Glider and postdoctoral researcher Georgia Munro-Cook shares a similar sentiment.\n\nShe believes failing to qualify for Paris highlighted the difficulties the sport is facing, with the number one problem a lack of a grassroots pipeline for women coming in.\n\nGeorgia Munro-Cook is a Paralympian and research fellow at Griffith University. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nWhile she acknowledged that both the men's and women's teams have had problems accessing training venues, sessions, and equipment, women and girls face the additional prospect of being held back from sport in general.\n\nIt's a numbers game, with more men participating in the sport than women, at an elite level the men's team has a more robust talent pool to select from.\n\n\"Women in general aren't encouraged to play much sport, and I think that's especially true for women with disability,\" Munro-Cook said.\n\n\"A more long-term issue is that often at the junior level, women are having to play with men. They're not able to then develop themselves.\"\n\nWorking towards a solution with the Play On project\n\nDel Toso has a desire to see more women and girls participating in wheelchair basketball.\n\nIt began after she looked for a way back into the sport after giving birth to her son.\n\nHaving competed in the National League since 2007, she was shocked to find, since the pandemic, that Victoria didn't have a team anymore.\n\nDel Toso found only a handful of grassroots opportunities specifically for disabled women and girls to play, sparking the idea to create her own program with former teammate and current Glider Shelley Matheson.\n\nShelley Matheson has been a Glider since 2004, winning two silver and a bronze medal at the Paralympics. (ABC News: Scott Jewel)\n\nTogether they have faced several issues to get the Play On project off the ground, including the same lack of access to equipment and venues as Munro-Cook mentions, as well as difficulties sourcing funding.\n\n\"We had to work really hard to say we're here, we're not going anywhere,\" Del Toso said.\n\nJuggling life and professional para sport\n\nConcerns around funding encompasses many Para sports, including wheelchair basketball.\n\nFrom Del Toso and Matheson's Play On program to women playing in the National League, women and girls struggle to financially sustain their participation.\n\nCurrent Glider Georgia Munro-Cook believes more disabled women and girls should be encouraged to play sport. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nBeyond moving to Europe, where players can be paid to compete, Munro-Cook said many women playing wheelchair basketball must work or study and find balancing life with competitive sport hard.\n\n\"There's kind of an expectation that you're training like you're a professional athlete, but we obviously don't have the economic incentives to be doing that,\" she said.\n\nAdd children to the mix and it becomes even harder for mothers like Del Toso and Matheson to find that balance.\n\nMatheson describes coming back to sport after giving birth like \"riding a bike,\" but despite feeling supported by Basketball Australia and her teammates, it was still personally difficult to manage her commitments.\n\n\"Being a mum is number one for me, but having to reduce the amount of time and effort I put into basketball is really challenging,\" the 40-year-old said.\n\nIn a statement, Basketball Australia said it is \"committed to the long-term growth and success of women's wheelchair basketball\".\n\nIt also said: \"We recognise the challenges that exist in participation, development, and high-performance outcomes, and are proactively working closely with stakeholders including the Australian Sports Commission, Paralympics Australia, and the National Institute Network to strengthen our wheelchair programs.\"\n\nAustralia's national women's wheelchair basketball team, the Gliders, in action. (Supplied: Leanne Del Tosso)\n\n'It should be about equality'\n\nDel Toso understands what's at stake for the sport, to see it thrive, she said athletes need to be nurtured and recognised for the talent they have.\n\n\"I know what the sport gave to me, and I just want to give that back to any female who wants to play wheelchair basketball,\" she said.\n\n\"It shouldn't be about funding, it shouldn't be about access, it should be about equality.\"\n\nIt's an uphill battle that Del Toso believes in, as does Munro-Cook, who said programs like Play On are \"fantastic\" and needed across the country.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nAll three women also want to see a shift in leadership, with a pipeline to coaching for disabled women just as important as a pipeline for players.\n\n\"A key to the greatest future and being successful is having disabled women, people who know the program in and out, making decisions about where this program is going,\" Matheson said.\n\n\"We need to see more women coaching at all levels. I would love to see a disabled woman coaching Australia one day.\"\n\nMaking inroads with the Play On project\n\nThe Play On program now has more than 30 women participating each week, ranging from young girls to seniors in their sixties. Del Toso believes they have some future wheelchair basketball superstars in the mix.\n\nWhat makes the program so unique is that it has been created by, created for, and is run by women with disabilities who have an inherent passion for the sport. A passion Del Toso and Matheson hope to share.\n\nThe Play On program was created to encourage disabled girls and women to play wheelchair basketball. (Supplied: Leanne Del Toso)\n\nSince beginning the program, the group has gained access to a community grant, which has allowed them to purchase some equipment, like competition wheelchairs.\n\nWheelchair Basketball Australia has also announced that three new women's teams will be welcomed into the National League this year, including from Victoria.\n\nDel Toso said they want to make sure that women and girls can compete, just for fun, or to take it to the highest level.\n\n\"It's really important that women with disability can connect socially and have a safe place to belong,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel like it's a great space for women to be empowered, to then go off and be the best version of themselves.\"",

(ABC Ballarat: Rochelle Kirkham)\n\nIf there's no houses for them to move into, we just have to come out and give food to make life a little easier for them.\"\n\nMr Rowse said there needed to be more homes available for those sleeping rough.\n\n\"You've got a warm home, safe at night, no animals coming in, you've got a place where you actually belong, a place that feels like home,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Uniting Church community services organisation, Uniting Vic.Tas, warns it is facing a funding crisis for its homeless outreach program in Ballarat and the Central Highlands.\n\nA spokesman said the state-funded Street to Home program was the only outreach program for people sleeping rough in Ballarat, Moorabool, Golden Plains, Hepburn, Ararat and Pyrenees, but was not guaranteed funding beyond June 30.\n\n\"We see people living in areas with no access to clean, running water or flushing toilets,\" he said.\n\n\"Families with children, people fleeing family violence, elderly people, people with disabilities terminal illnesses and they are sleeping on the streets, in cars, tents, dilapidated caravans and squatting in abandoned buildings.\n\n\"Demand for homelessness services across the Ballarat region is higher than ever and that's why we not only need funding for Street to Home beyond this financial year, but long-term certainty to ensure the program continues well into the future.\"",

    "text": "It didn\u2019t feel like a defining moment at the time. But looking back, it probably was.\n\nAs week two of the campaign for Wills drew to a close, Labor\u2019s Peter Khalil stood on an outdoor basketball court in North Fitzroy, announcing $3.7 million to rebuild Linear Park, which includes one of the busiest bike paths in the country.\n\nOnce an old rail line, it became green space under former Wills MP and prime minister Bob Hawke. Now, here Khalil was with Yarra Council\u2019s socialist mayor Steve Jolly promising to help rebuild it.\n\nAbout 100 people were gathered, far more than the few dozen at a debate in Fawkner the day before that Khalil had skipped. But this time, he\u2019d shown up \u2013 in the heart of Greens territory, flanked by Boomers who\u2019d ventured out from their multi-million-dollar homes on this sunny Sunday afternoon. Some were familiar from when I covered this area for The Melbourne Times 20 years ago.\n\nThe spending pledges didn\u2019t stop at Linear Park: Gillon Oval, Fawkner Netball Club, Merri Creek \u2013 all were promised serious money. Khalil was offering a powerful marginal seat message: \u201cI\u2019m in government, I can bring home the goods.\u201d\n\nFormer state Labor MP Carlo Carli put it plainly: \u201cThis was a masterful campaign based around this idea that \u2018A Labor government can deliver, and here I am, ready to deliver\u2019.\u201d\n\nLabor MP Peter Khalil has won re-election in Wills. Credit: Gus McCubbing\n\nIt worked in the richer southern end of the electorate, where voters who long ago came over to the Greens could be persuaded back to Labor with two key messages: don\u2019t risk Dutton, and keep the good stuff flowing.\n\nBut in the north of the seat \u2013 where many voters are Muslim, rent, or have grown tired of Labor taking them for granted \u2013 it was a different story.\n\nHere, Greens candidate Samantha Ratnam \u2013 who quit state parliament to run for the federal seat \u2013 made a strong pitch, promising to address rent hikes, the climate catastrophe, soaring costs and Gaza.\n\nIn a campaign where three Greens including leader Adam Bandt \u2013 and even Liberal leader Peter Dutton \u2013 were swept aside by Labor, Ratnam drove a 7 per cent swing against the party, pushing this once-safe seat to the brink. Against the national tide and a flat Labor incumbent, she turned Wills into a key contest.\n\nFor months, alongside her campaign, a group called Muslim Votes Matter had been urging voters to punish Labor explicitly over Gaza \u2013 at mosques, markets and community events.\n\nGreens candidate Samantha Ratnam, pictured with outgoing Greens leader Adam Bandt, at Brunswick East Primary School during the campaign. Credit: Getty\n\nTheir effort boiled over in week one of pre-polling, when a Labor staffer and a Palestinian activist clashed over a protest sign. Police were called.\n\nThe Greens picked up big swings in the Muslim-majority north. They even won a booth \u2013 John Fawkner Secondary College \u2013 for the first time, with a stunning 28 per cent swing on the two-party vote.\n\nWas it Gaza? Was it housing affordability pushing younger Greens voters into the outer north? Was it climate inaction? Probably all three and more. And yet, it wasn\u2019t enough. Like all the times before that the Greens said they might win it, Wills didn\u2019t flip.\n\nLabor\u2019s showing in Wills though was notably weak compared to neighbouring Melbourne where the party notched a nine per cent swing and toppled Bandt. In Wills, Labor hung on by its fingernails, relying on incumbency, funding promises and fear of Peter Dutton to scrape over the line.\n\nOne of the most insightful interviews of this campaign was with Phil Cleary, who knows Wills as well as anyone. He believed Gaza could influence the vote. The former independent MP and Coburg football legend held the seat from 1992 to 1996 after Hawke resigned. He remains the only non-Labor MP ever to do so.\n\nKhalil, Cleary said, \u201cis a victim of a party that won\u2019t use words like genocide and won\u2019t talk strongly about the killing of women and children in Gaza\u201d. But Cleary wasn\u2019t sure it would cost Labor the seat; he lost to the machine himself and knows how ruthless and effective ALP campaigning can be.\n\nFormer independent MP for Wills Phil Cleary. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui\n\nBy the final week, Labor\u2019s message came into focus as it used its financial might to blitz the seat with letterboxing and direct mail. One penned by Julia Gillard stuck tightly to the script: every seat lost helped Dutton become PM. Khalil still had PTSD from 2019, he said, when the ALP expected to win government and was beaten by Scott Morrison and his \u201cmiracle\u201d.\n\nPre-polling was relentless. I was at the Brunswick booth every day bar one, and Khalil and Ratnam were both there each day that I visited.\n\nAnd while pre-poll in Brunswick was always a theatre of democracy, sometimes it was also farce.\n\nTake Romeo \u2013 a One Nation volunteer whose surname I never learned \u2013 wandering the line with an Australian flag and sometimes, inexplicably, an Italian one too.\n\nHe would chant \u201cOne flag, One Nation\u201d. Could there be a suburb in Australia less welcoming to such sentiment than Brunswick? A man in a Collingwood jumper \u2013 notably Indigenous player Bobby Hill\u2019s number 23 \u2013 pelted him with eggs.\n\nRomeo shrugged it off, but a couple of days later when he told me someone had threatened to shoot him, he went home, fashioned two metal plates into an ad hoc bulletproof jacket he placed over his shirt, then returned to the booth.\n\nOne Nation volunteer, Romeo, with his armour.\n\nOne Nation\u2019s candidate got a 1 per cent swing, reaching 3.5 per cent of the primary vote. So it appears there\u2019s room for everyone in Australian democracy it seems \u2013 even in Brunswick.\n\nThis is the third time I\u2019ve covered one seat for an entire campaign like this. By the final days, it gives you clarity you don\u2019t expect when you start. You come to understand the jostling, the ground game, and how broader issues \u2013 war, climate, housing, the cost of a cup of coffee \u2013 land differently from one suburb to the next.\n\nIn the end, that moment in North Fitzroy \u2013 a Labor MP promising money for a bike path \u2013 was more than a local funding pledge. It was a case study in how politics still works here: tangible, transactional, and attentive to who turns up.\n\nThe Greens harnessed fury over Gaza. They tapped disillusionment on climate. They tried to create a wave to surf home \u2013 only to find Labor knew Dutton was a tsunami. And Labor, when threatened, can still marshall money, endorsements and machine-like discipline.\n\nWills didn\u2019t fall. But it shifted. Gaza cracked something open in the north where Labor\u2019s hold can no longer be assumed. The Greens are now within 2 per cent of taking this seat. If their candidate in the next election is weaker, maybe the margin returns to Labor. But in a seat named after a failed explorer, I suspect this electorate is ready to chart a new course \u2013 even if, this time, it decided to wait a little longer.",

Back home in Perth, it is impossible to escape from their day job.\n\nBoth brothers loved their upbringing in Perth and return whenever there is a viable gap in their schedule. Sydney can never replace the family and friends they miss, but it has given them a different perspective on their daily lives.\n\nEarlier this year, before signing their respective two-year contract extensions at the Sydney Swans, Chad and Corey Warner thought long and hard about what the club and the city meant to them.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely a benefit for us in Sydney here; you can go out with your mates, or go out for dinner, go to the beach, and you can just be a different person and not like an AFL player, and not have all the attention on you for a bit when you\u2019re away from the club. But it\u2019s definitely a reminder when you go back to Perth.\u201d\n\nCorey and Chad Warner at Swans headquarters before Saturday\u2019s game against Essendon. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nSince his breakthrough season in 2022 when he made the All-Australian squad, Chad has gradually become used to the level of interest in his career at home. The star midfielder seriously considered offers to move home to the Dockers and Eagles, but understood that his life would change dramatically.\n\n\u201cOn the weekend, we went out because Dad was over for the [Giants] game, and went out to the [Coogee] Pav to have a few beers, and you never do anything wrong, but I feel like [in] Perth they\u2019d be trying to find something that you\u2019re doing wrong, so that is really annoying,\u201d Chad said.\n\n\u201cEven coaches over there \u2013 I think at the moment the Freo coach [Justin Longmuir] is copping it a lot \u2013 and I think it\u2019s really, really tough in that regard, too, because fans are pretty ruthless over there. And I think a lot of the time they want to blame, and just want to keep blaming and blaming, and I think the coach at the moment is kind of falling victim to that a bit.\u201d",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Mia* was out for drinks with her colleagues in Brisbane\u2019s Fortitude Valley three years ago when her drink was spiked. She had switched to water about 10pm, not wanting to drink too much at the work event at a Brunswick Street Mall bar. But half an hour later, the then 24-year-old started feeling \u201csuper nauseous\u201d. \u201cEveryone was asking me if I was OK, if I had drunk too much. I was confused because I had stopped drinking,\u201d Mia recalls. She left the bar and returned to her office, where she collapsed at her desk. \u201cMy body felt really heavy. I could move, but my movements weren\u2019t very controlled. I don\u2019t think I could have stood up properly and walked unassisted without falling over.\u201d She called her partner to come pick her up, and made it home safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few days later, Mia decided to see a GP and ask for a drug test. It returned positive for benzodiazepines, a depressant drug with a sedative effect used to treat anxiety and insomnia. \u201cI suspected I was spiked because I\u2019ve been given benzodiazepines and reacted poorly to them in the past,\u201d she says. \u201cThey make me mentally foggy for a few days afterwards, which is how I was feeling.\u201d Loading It\u2019s uncommon for drink-spiking victims to have their experience validated by a toxicology test. \u201cA lot of people usually start piecing it together but then by the time they go [to get tested], it\u2019s too late for anything to realistically show up,\u201d she says. Health professionals say there is a narrow window to test for drugs. For most substances associated with drink spiking, the ideal timeframe is between 12 and 72 hours, though some drugs leave the body in as little as three hours. Some who believe they have been spiked will head to an emergency department, but Queensland Health say hospitals \u201cwill not routinely facilitate testing for drink spiking due to impact on treatment times\u201d. \u201cOur emergency departments treat patients based on their symptoms to ensure they receive the best care possible, and toxicology tests are generally not required to guide treatment,\u201d a spokesperson said. They can, however, refer patients to police for forensic testing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQueensland Police say that once a complaint is received, \u201can investigation will commence\u201d and testing will be organised if needed. In Queensland, emergency departments do not routinely test for drink spiking. Credit: Dion Georgopoulos The Alcohol and Drug Foundation chief executive Dr Erin Lalor AM says drink spiking has always been under-reported in Australia, with victims often fearful they\u2019ll be blamed for what happened, \u201cespecially if they were already drinking or taking other drugs\u201d. But what if there was a faster way to determine if a drink has been spiked, even before the victim or the perpetrator leaves a venue? Troy Stewart is the managing director of SureScreen Diagnostics Australia, the company behind a new rapid drink-spiking test. He believes these devices are the missing component to address the issue. The device is designed to detect drugs commonly associated with drink spiking, including GHB, ketamine and 22 types of benzodiazepines, within minutes, not hours. While no single test can guarantee a drink is safe, Stewart says SureScreen Diagnostics\u2019 technology has performed significantly better than other products, particularly with variables such as milk products and fruit juices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStewart has spent the last 12 months lobbying governments and other stakeholders to help stock the tests in venues across the country. In high-risk precincts, such as Fortitude Valley, he wants the government to fund a pilot trial that could see them distributed to every bar. Loading \u201cIf venues have these devices on hand, it means that anyone who suspects their drink has been tampered with can approach a staff member to have their beverage tested immediately,\u201d he says. In the New South Wales city of Albury, a trial of the devices in the area\u2019s clubs and pubs has seen early signs of success. Nine days after the trial began in February, patrons saw something being added to a woman\u2019s drink. \u201cThey reported that to security and security then very swiftly checked video footage and validated what they had seen,\u201d Albury Liquor Accord chair Craig Kidd says. \u201cThey approached the victim and took their drink to get tested. It returned a positive result \u2013 twice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKidd says the victim was taken to a hospital in Albury with the tests, where police were also called. NSW police used the security footage to identify the perpetrator, who was found and charged with possessing illicit substances. The Multi-Lined Rapid Beverage Test (MRBT) can detect over 20 substances commonly associated with drink spiking. Credit: Markus Ravik \u201cWe\u2019re hoping by having the drink spiking devices available during this trial, we can normalise that you should report it,\u201d Kidd says. Stewart has presented to Hervey Bay, Maryborough, Gympie, Bundaberg, Gladstone and Chinchilla liquor accords, and contacted Queensland\u2019s chief police, health, justice and youth ministers. He says they\u2019ve been receptive, but as yet, no Queensland cities have signed up for a trial like the one in NSW. Kidd says Albury\u2019s trial began in response to reports, largely spread across social media, about incidents of suspected drink spiking. \u201cThe local press picked up on that ... but it was really hard to quantify.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In August 2022, Caleb Harper was sitting in his underwear in a sweltering room in Los Angeles, willing the air-conditioner to work. The Spacey Jane frontman had just begun scribbling down the first lines of a song that would become August, the first track to emerge from their third album. But it wasn\u2019t coming easily in the 40-degree heat and the song ended up sitting on the shelf for about 18 months, Harper occasionally pulling it down to tweak a line here or there. Other songs came and were put to tape, the album was nearly tied up, but August remained out-of-reach. \u201cI had a counter melody that wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Harper says over Zoom from Los Angeles, air-conditioning working this time. \u201cI ended up writing it on the last morning, and Peppa [Lane, bassist] and I went in and sang it that day.\u201d That final counter melody carries out the track with the floating refrain \u201cif that makes sense?\u201c, which the band then lifted for the album\u2019s title. \u201cIt really bookends that period,\u201d Harper says, noting its meaning shifted considerably over the writing period, from a meditation on leaving Australia to predicting the beginning of a breakup. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard listen, honestly.\u201d Spacey Jane on stage in Melbourne in December 2021, after the breakout success of Booster Seat. Credit: Getty August, like the rest of If That Makes Sense, was written and recorded over two years in LA \u2013 the first time the Perth band had recorded outside Australia. It was a big deal for the quartet (Harper and Lane are joined by drummer Kieran Lama and guitarist Ashton Hardman-Le Cornu), who have been synonymous with the Australian indie rock scene since their jangly, vulnerable 2020 debut album Sunlight. Sunlight was borne from the runaway single Booster Seat, which reached #2 in that year\u2019s Hottest 100, behind Glass Animals\u2019 Heat Waves. The band would become frequent Hottest 100 lurkers: in the 2022 countdown, following their second album Here Comes Everybody, they featured six times, three of those coming in the top 10. In 2022, the band was the third-biggest seller of vinyl for the year, behind Taylor Swift and Harry Styles. They\u2019ve ridden this wave of popularity on numerous sold-out tours of the country, and are comfortable standalone headliners for the biggest local festivals. There aren\u2019t many bigger bands in Australian music right now, if any.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the gruelling touring schedule for Here Comes Everybody (which had really stretched back years to the start of Sunlight), the band\u2019s management stepped in and told them to take a break. \u201cIt started as quite a difficult thing,\u201d Harper says. \u201cIt was almost counterintuitive \u2026 We are a band that considers our job to play shows. It was almost like the music served that. Now we\u2019ve gone through a process of unlearning that and figuring out how to focus on making this record and pulling this world together first. And also giving the market a bit of space, from a business perspective. \u201cBut once we hopped off that train, we were all freaked out. Especially, because we were living all around the world, we didn\u2019t see each other as much.\u201d Like many Australian artists before him, Harper landed in LA and endured the merry-go-round of songwriting sessions \u2013 a process he called \u201cf---ing terrifying\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d always been protective of the songwriting process, and it always has been in my bedroom,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to advocate for ideas that I liked, and I didn\u2019t know how to say no to things I didn\u2019t like. I would often not put forward ideas at all because I was just like, \u2018If they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s embarrassing\u2019. But now I find it\u2019s liberating to have that conflict of ideas. I\u2019m grateful that I went through that transition.\u201d It\u2019s easy to understand Harper\u2019s apprehension. His lyrics have always been intensely personal, and the songs on If That Makes Sense feature some wrenching moments. On the churning single All the Noise, Harper reflects on his upbringing: \u201cAnd that was the way that they gave to me \u2026 A promise that I would hurt everybody that I ever meet\u201d. Then there\u2019s the shouted, tortured mantra in So Much Taller: \u201cYou\u2019ll never be enough and you\u2019ll never be loved, and the fact you tried is embarrassing enough\u201d. Recent single Through My Teeth obliquely references Harper shedding his religious upbringing and throwing himself headlong into partying at university. A lot of the album pulls in this direction and sifts through the various answers to the question: what happens when you have to drag your trauma into adulthood? \u201cBeing out here,\u201d Harper says after a pause, after we bring up Through My Teeth, \u201cit\u2019s almost like pulling myself out of my present life in Australia made the past compress, like the last 26 years of my life were all just in one accessible bank in a way that they hadn\u2019t been before\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden things didn\u2019t seem as far away \u2013 not that they were any clearer,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have trouble recalling much of my childhood, as I think a lot of people do, especially if they have negative things associated with that \u2026 Your brain tends to bury things or contort them. But I think a lot of it became far clearer or more in my face than it had been before.\u201d Being away from Australia pulled some things into focus, but it also brought with it a lot of homesickness and guilt. \u201cI think family is the main one,\u201d Harper answers, when I ask where the guilt comes from. \u201cThere\u2019s already a host of issues and contentious things there. Being away is an interesting escape from that. \u201cBut sometimes I take too much liberty when it comes to escaping things back home. Like I\u2019m really bad at messaging my friends back, I\u2019m really bad at calling my dad \u2026 and that\u2019s just something that weighs on me a lot. Relationships suffer, and you feel like it\u2019s your fault.\u201d \u2018We\u2019d be kicking ourselves if we didn\u2019t try [to break overseas].\u2019 Caleb Harper, frontman of Spacey Jane Sonically, If That Makes Sense doesn\u2019t deviate wildly from the Spacey Jane playbook, but the band have beefed things up considerably with undercurrents of synths and layers upon layers of guitars and vocals. It\u2019s the result of taking a longer time in the studio, and the presence of big-time producer Mike Crossey (Arctic Monkeys, the 1975, Wolf Alice). \u201cWe didn\u2019t shy away from producing it, like really producing it,\u201d Harper says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Let\u2019s put everything in here that we like and make it feel as big and wide as possible\u2019.\u201d The band also ran the entire record through tape at the end, a process that rounds out the sound and makes it feel richer, warmer (like the difference between an MP3 file and a vinyl record).\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "A record number of women helped Labor secure its landslide election win, raising questions around how the Coalition can boost its gender diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor women will outnumber men in the lower house for the first time, with at least 15 newly elected MPs contributing to the 48 of 90 seats already called for the major party.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew faces in parliament include Renee Coffey, representing Griffith after defeating the Greens' Max Chandler-Mather , Jo Briskey who succeeds former NDIS minister Bill Shorten in Maribyrnong, and Ash Ambihaipahar, who takes over Barton from former Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney, who has retired.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen's Minister Katy Gallagher told ABC's RN it's a testament to Labor's continued work towards gender equality over three decades, having introduced quotas in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The thing about gender equality in the Labor Party is everyone in the caucus is for gender equality. That conversation or that argument has been won,\" Gallagher said on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nA record-breaking number of women have been elected to Australia's parliament, with a major share coming from Labor's ranks in the House of Representatives. Source: SBS News Labor MPs will join a historic 48th parliament with at least 67 women making up the lower house, an increase from 58 in 2022 and 40 under a Morrison-led government.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, that number could rise as high as 72 depending on the final results in Bean, Longman, Monash, and Bullwinkel.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Hunter, CEO of the Diversity Council of Australia, told SBS News this election marked a major milestone for gender diversity in parliament, with diversity more broadly \"essential for a healthy democracy\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When people making decisions reflect the diversity of the Australian community, the policies they create are more likely to be more inclusive, more effective, and ultimately, fairer,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said lived experience is critical to making decisions, otherwise leaders risk \"overlooking or misunderstanding the realities facing huge sections of the population\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, how does Australia compare to the rest of the world?\n\n\n\nCoalition faces quota pressures as women representation drops\n\nWhile Labor's gender diversity continues to grow, the Coalition went backwards at this election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt elected seven women MPs out of 40, a decrease from nine in 2022. It may be boosted slightly by Gisele Kapterian, if she retains the tightly contested seat of Bradfield in NSW.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is due to Bridget Archer losing Bass and Jenny Ware losing Hughes, as well as men replacing retiring MPs Karen Andrews in McPherson and Nola Marino in Forrest.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 10 independents currently projected to enter parliament, seven are women.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Liberal frontbencher Simon Birmingham argues the Coalition should consider \"hard, fast and ambitious\" quotas for women in parliament, with representation so low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I struggle to think of any alternatives if there's to be a new direction that truly demonstrates change and truly guarantees that the party will better reflect the composition of modern society,\" he said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Liberal NSW premier Barry O'Farrell said it is important that political parties reflect the community they represent, with more diversity both culturally and in terms of gender.\n\n\n\n\n\nPressed on women quotas specifically, he told SBS News the Liberals \"need to increase its diversity in all areas\".\n\n\n\nA record number of women will represent Australians in the federal parliament, a considerable uptick from the 58 women who were elected to the 47th parliament. Source: SBS News Michelle Ryan is the director of the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at The Australian National University.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told SBS News that alongside quotas, the Coalition needs to consider where it's placing its women candidates, avoiding the glass cliff.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe glass cliff refers to women being given leadership opportunities during difficult times or times of crises, but in a political context, can refer to being placed in more difficult contests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We did an analysis last election and what we saw is that women are more likely than men to be placed in risky and precarious seats, so ones that are basically either unwinnable or difficult to win or hold,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They do differ by party as well. For the Coalition, women were much more likely to be in those unwinnable seats.\"\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News\n\nHow does Australia compare to the rest of the world?\n\nAustralia does \"pretty well relative to its comparators\", according to Ryan.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said Scandinavian countries such as Finland, which has had three women prime ministers, and Switzerland, which has had five women presidents, often lead perceptions around gender diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, parliaments like Rwanda, which in 2024 had 50 per cent representation, often surprise the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So that's partly due to quotas. It's partly to do with genocide, where many men were killed. So the reasons for representation are often different,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said this includes the rise of women to head of state due to marriage or being the daughter of a previous prime minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther countries with at least half of their parliament or lower house made up of women include Cuba, Nicaragua, Andorra, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates, according to UN Women.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN Women calculates that globally, only 27.2 per cent of parliamentarians in single or lower houses are women, with monarchy-based systems excluded from the count.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite a mammoth election year globally in 2024, 107 countries have yet to have a woman as the head of state.\n\n\n\n",

And I'd literally just sit down and cry and think, 'I can't do this anymore' Because it was ruining every aspect of my life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSixty-year-old Michelle Watts is recounting a ski trip - one of many occasions where she bled through layers of clothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle suffered from heavy menstrual bleeding for 18 months from 2021, which the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare defines as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with a woman's quality of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was about as sad as I could ever be because everything was, everything was impossible to do in my eyes by the end. I couldn't go swimming with my friends anymore, swimming became challenging, going to the gym became challenging. All those things that I loved to do, I just couldn't do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many failed treatments, Michelle finally underwent a uterectomy, traditionally known as a hysterectomy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the original terminology for this procedure is causing concern among some specialists, due to its links to the Greek word 'hysteria'.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Talat Uppal is a Gynaecologist and Director at Women's Health Road - and is in the process of changing the language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was really thought to explain a lot of the concerns women might have had.... both on the emotional and physical front, which was actually not factual and not found to be correct.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne in four people who menstruate suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding, and two thirds of those experience iron deficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet less than half of women suffering from the condition visit a doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Traditionally or historically women have been left out of research. And sometimes even the animals in the labs were male animals. And so this is a long historical background of disadvantage of not including women. And we really want to change that narrative when it comes to heavy bleeding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Uppal welcomes a number of measures in the government's multi-million dollar investment in women's health, but would like to see more attention given to this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's just part of that silence around heavy menstrual bleeding... and I don't think it's deliberate, I feel it's just a culture where it's not front of mind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle believes a lack of awareness is why she struggled to receive adequate care for months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just been so normalised....and I don't think it should be, I don't think it's normal. And it's really hard to get any information because it's just taken as 'well you're a woman, this is what happens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe can't imagine what her life would have looked like without undergoing the procedure, now relishing the active lifestyle she was forced to sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My ability to participate in skiing, running, swimming... all of the things that I wanted to enjoy, that's all possible again, I never have to worry about that ever again, it's like an absolute new lease of life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's part of an international effort to make medical language more accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelping lead the change is the CSIRO, who are responsible for updating global standards for clinical terminology.\n\n\n\n\n\nKatrina Ebril is the Interoperability Lead with the Australian e-Health research centre at the CSIRO, and says this change is a first when it comes to women's bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's definitely time to change... and we do this for other procedures. And it is a uterectomy, let's call it what it is, and start to use that much more positive language and much more language that aligns to what the actual procedure is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor women like Michelle, removing taboos around menstruation is key to making treatment more accessible, and encouraging others to seek help.\n\n\n\n",

Let's give it up for Australia's Prime Minister\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA rockstar welcome... for the leader who led the landslide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't seek power for its own sake. Not to decide who's in what part of the building. We seek power in order to deliver for the poeple who need Labor to be in government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the vote count is finalised for the lower house seats, one thing is certain: more women in federal parliament than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Labor, six more women have been elected in Queensland alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says that is something to be proud of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I look around this room and I see a representative group. A majority of women, up to - we're still counting of course - but at least 57 per cent women\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese has also announced his new ministry.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Mark Dreyfus and Science and Industry Minister Ed Husic will no longer be on the frontbench.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new additions include: Tim Ayres and Jess Walsh.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says he is sympathetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got too many good people for the spots that we have. You know, I feel for those two guys. It's always difficult when you've got as much talent as we have to fit everyone in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating was outraged, describing the demotion in a statement as an appalling denial of Ed Husic's diligence and application.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe optics of this decision are challenging for Labor, which promotes itself as the party of inclusion and diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles has defended Anthony Albanese's decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only 30 spots are available. Inevitably there are more people who could serve as really effective ministers... And it can be tough, but we need to balance stability with renewal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Opposition is seeking to rebuild after its election loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two candidates confirming their intentions to run for the leadership are opposition spokesman for treasury affairs Angus Taylor; and deputy leader Sussan Ley [[Lee]].\n\n\n\n\n\nThey both delivered their pitches - Sussan Ley:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to take a backwards step. We can be successful. We can win the next election, and this is a moment to look forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nand Angus Taylor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've rebuilt businesses. I've fought on the frontlines of tough debates. I know what it takes to lead, unify and deliver.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nationals are still reeling from the defection of Jacinta Nampijinpa Price to the Liberal Party, while David Littleproud is now facing a contest over his job as leader of the junior Coalition party.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a member of the Country Liberal Party, Ms Price can choose to sit with either the Liberals or Nationals.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she believes she can have a greater impact by switching to the Liberals.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals Senate leader Bridget McKenzie told Sky News she is disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah absolutely. I think it's a devastating loss to our party room, particularly our Senate party room. We're a tight team. We're a close knit team. We fought many battles together, and whilst we're strong Coalitionists, we are very, very separate parties. And so it's very disappointing news that Jacinta has decided to head over to the Liberals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens are also yet to choose a new leader, but acting leader Nick McKim says they're ready to wield the Senate balance of power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Prime Minister's comments have more than a whiff of arrogance and hubris and we have no intention of taking our riding instructions from an arrogant prime minister.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australia's highest-profile cricket stars are scrambling to fly out of India, with the Indian Premier League (IPL) suspended due to the country's escalating conflict with Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter players woke up Friday uneasy and uncertain on their immediate future, Indian officials announced after lunch the league would be suspended for one week with immediate effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt came as bosses of the world's most popular cricket tournament met the morning after a match in Dharamsala was abandoned amid air raid warnings in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral Australian players have begun moving towards airports, with some to fly out as early as Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers are facing logistical hurdles to leave the country due to airport closures, including bus rides of up to four hours before eight-hour train trips for some players.\n\n\n\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia confirmed in a statement the decision was made after teams confirmed concerns from their players about the tournament continuing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday's decision to suspend the IPL came as the Pakistan Super League (PSL) was moved to Dubai, with six Australians featuring in that competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PSL's move is expected to clear the path for overseas players to see out the tournament, with Australians David Warner, Sean Abbott and Ben Dwarshuis among those featuring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The safety and welfare of our players and staff is always a core priority and we support today's decision by the BCCI,\" Cricket Australia CEO Todd Greenberg said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We continue to work closely with the Australian Government, PCB and BCCI and are maintaining regular communication with players and support staff in both India and Pakistan.\"\n\n\n\nThe suspension of the IPL will leave a number of questions, including whether the lucrative league will resume after a week or indeed at all this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it does resume, there is also no guarantee overseas players would return and be available.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 12 games remain in the competition, along with a four-game finals series.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions will also linger over the ramifications regarding player payments, given all teams have up to two matches left to play out.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Australian players were understood to be keen to exit the country, but were also concerned about what it could mean for future chances if they did quit the league.\n\n\n\nThe Punjab Kings, coached by former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, leaving after the ground they were playing in was evacuated. Source: AP / Ashwini Bhatia Test captain Pat Cummins, fellow fast bowlers Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, and star batter Travis Head are among the Australians featuring in the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis, Mitch Marsh, Nathan Ellis, Aaron Hardie and Xavier Bartlett are among other Australians still playing, while numerous compatriots are also represented within coaching staff and media covering the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Test players, the suspension is likely to mean unexpected time at home before next month's World Test Championship final in England and a subsequent tour of the West Indies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe need to suspend the tournament was made clear when air-raid warnings prompted the Ricky Ponting-coached Punjab Kings' match against Starc's Delhi side to be abandoned on Thursday night as the stadium was evacuated.\n\n\n\nAirports in Dharamsala and Chandigarh \u2014 where the Kings are based \u2014 have been closed for civilian and commercial use since Wednesday, while others across India's north-western corridor are also out of bounds to the cricketers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree IPL franchises \u2014 Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Rajasthan Royals \u2014 are already out of finals contention.\n\n\n\n\n\nCricket Australia (CA) has been across the situation in India and Pakistan since 26 people were killed and 17 injured in an attack in the Kashmir region late last month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We continue to closely monitor the situation in Pakistan and India, including obtaining regular advice and updates from the Australian government, the PCB [Pakistan Cricket Board], BCCI and local government authorities, and maintaining communication with our players and support staff currently in the region,\" a CA spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you name a single blood cancer symptom?\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a question being asked by the Leukaemia Foundation, which says its own research reveals that 4 out of 5 Australians cannot name a single symptom.\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Stavreski, the head of research at Leukaemia Foundation, says there are seven symptoms to look out for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That includes recurrent infections, increased fatigue, pain in bones and joints, excessive night sweats and enlarged lymph nodes. So generally, around the neck and groin region. One of the other symptoms is unexplained weight loss. So if you are losing weight but not changing your diet, not exercising, but you are seeing it on the scale; then that is a tell-table sign of a possible blood cancer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation says there has been a 79 per cent jump in the incidence of blood cancer in the past 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood cancer impacts all age groups including children, teenagers and adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nProud Brinja-Yuin woman Kerry Boyenga is an author and teacher of the Indigenous language, Dhurga.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was diagnosed with the blood cancer non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2017 and thankfully survived her diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer main symptom was a tumour in the left-hand side of her neck which grew to be the size of a tennis ball.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors put it down to a side effect of an existing autoimmune illness that Kerry had - which initially delayed her diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I first noticed something was wrong in December of 2016. It wasn't until June 2017 that it was actually diagnosed. It was quite some time before anybody did take it seriously. I completely understand that. Yes, I had this disorder and I am getting swollen glands. Because I have had it for as long as I've had it, but I've never had one that had grown to the size that it was. And it was really quite frightening and it's horrendous to look at it. When I look at it now, I look at the photos and I think: 'oh my God, was that really me?' So it was stage two by the time I was diagnosed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being in remission, Kerry still lives with the physical, psychological, and financial impacts of her diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nKerry has had vision issues in her left eye, cardiac issues, and a type of shingles, which has meant she's had to reduce her workload.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite all of this, she feels incredibly grateful for the support shown to her from family, friends and her local community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that's because of the support that I had with my family, my husband, most importantly, and my son. But my colleagues, I worked in a Catholic school at the time. They cooked all of our meals because I'd gone from 90 kilos down to 63, I think I was. So I couldn't do anything and I certainly wasn't eating. And I think that all had to do with the beautiful people that were in my life. It was just beautiful. It just shows in these sort of hard times that people can be really beautiful and caring.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile screening programs have improved dramatically for cancers like bowel, skin, breast and prostate; there is no standard screening process for detecting blood cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Stavreski says blood tests are often the first clinical indication that something is wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you go to your GP and ask for a blood test, a full blood count should be able to provide an indication if there is anything wrong. So that might be looking at red cells or white cells - either they're too low or they're too high. So that should be an indication that it could possibly be blood cancer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Ian Olver is a cancer researcher at the University of Adelaide.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there have been great developments in the treatment of many cancers, with immunotherapy showing positive results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, certainly with childhood (cancers), leukaemia treatments have done incredibly well over the last few years. Not quite so well with adults. But we're starting to improve the treatments, particularly as we're starting to introduce immunotherapy with our chemotherapy. So I think we can be optimistic that as the years go by, there is potential to cure these diseases will be greater. Or at least control them, so someone can have a normal lifespan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is like many cancers, the sooner someone is diagnosed with blood cancer, the greater their chances of surviving the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Stavreski again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important to take action quickly and go see your doctor. Delaying seeing your doctor will mean delaying diagnosis (and) delaying treatment. And unfortunately, if there is a delay in diagnosis, survival rates, positive outcomes really are reduced.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKerry has been in remission for years now. And she says she is doing all the right things to keep on top of her health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have been in remission for seven-and-a-half years. So I am heading into my eighth year. And it can come back. It may not. I am just really grateful that here I am; and I've still got an extra right years when it could have been over sooner, you know?.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "It didn\u2019t feel like a defining moment at the time. But looking back, it probably was.\n\nAs week two of the campaign for Wills drew to a close, Labor\u2019s Peter Khalil stood on an outdoor basketball court in North Fitzroy, announcing $3.7 million to rebuild Linear Park, which includes one of the busiest bike paths in the country.\n\nOnce an old rail line, it became green space under former Wills MP and prime minister Bob Hawke. Now, here Khalil was with Yarra Council\u2019s socialist mayor Steve Jolly promising to help rebuild it.\n\nAbout 100 people were gathered, far more than the few dozen at a debate in Fawkner the day before that Khalil had skipped. But this time, he\u2019d shown up \u2013 in the heart of Greens territory, flanked by Boomers who\u2019d ventured out from their multi-million-dollar homes on this sunny Sunday afternoon. Some were familiar from when I covered this area for The Melbourne Times 20 years ago.\n\nThe spending pledges didn\u2019t stop at Linear Park: Gillon Oval, Fawkner Netball Club, Merri Creek \u2013 all were promised serious money. Khalil was offering a powerful marginal seat message: \u201cI\u2019m in government, I can bring home the goods.\u201d\n\nFormer state Labor MP Carlo Carli put it plainly: \u201cThis was a masterful campaign based around this idea that \u2018A Labor government can deliver, and here I am, ready to deliver\u2019.\u201d\n\nLabor MP Peter Khalil has won re-election in Wills. Credit: Gus McCubbing\n\nIt worked in the richer southern end of the electorate, where voters who long ago came over to the Greens could be persuaded back to Labor with two key messages: don\u2019t risk Dutton, and keep the good stuff flowing.\n\nBut in the north of the seat \u2013 where many voters are Muslim, rent, or have grown tired of Labor taking them for granted \u2013 it was a different story.\n\nHere, Greens candidate Samantha Ratnam \u2013 who quit state parliament to run for the federal seat \u2013 made a strong pitch, promising to address rent hikes, the climate catastrophe, soaring costs and Gaza.\n\nIn a campaign where three Greens including leader Adam Bandt \u2013 and even Liberal leader Peter Dutton \u2013 were swept aside by Labor, Ratnam drove a 7 per cent swing against the party, pushing this once-safe seat to the brink. Against the national tide and a flat Labor incumbent, she turned Wills into a key contest.\n\nFor months, alongside her campaign, a group called Muslim Votes Matter had been urging voters to punish Labor explicitly over Gaza \u2013 at mosques, markets and community events.\n\nGreens candidate Samantha Ratnam, pictured with outgoing Greens leader Adam Bandt, at Brunswick East Primary School during the campaign. Credit: Getty\n\nTheir effort boiled over in week one of pre-polling, when a Labor staffer and a Palestinian activist clashed over a protest sign. Police were called.\n\nThe Greens picked up big swings in the Muslim-majority north. They even won a booth \u2013 John Fawkner Secondary College \u2013 for the first time, with a stunning 28 per cent swing on the two-party vote.\n\nWas it Gaza? Was it housing affordability pushing younger Greens voters into the outer north? Was it climate inaction? Probably all three and more. And yet, it wasn\u2019t enough. Like all the times before that the Greens said they might win it, Wills didn\u2019t flip.\n\nLabor\u2019s showing in Wills though was notably weak compared to neighbouring Melbourne where the party notched a nine per cent swing and toppled Bandt. In Wills, Labor hung on by its fingernails, relying on incumbency, funding promises and fear of Peter Dutton to scrape over the line.\n\nOne of the most insightful interviews of this campaign was with Phil Cleary, who knows Wills as well as anyone. He believed Gaza could influence the vote. The former independent MP and Coburg football legend held the seat from 1992 to 1996 after Hawke resigned. He remains the only non-Labor MP ever to do so.\n\nKhalil, Cleary said, \u201cis a victim of a party that won\u2019t use words like genocide and won\u2019t talk strongly about the killing of women and children in Gaza\u201d. But Cleary wasn\u2019t sure it would cost Labor the seat; he lost to the machine himself and knows how ruthless and effective ALP campaigning can be.\n\nFormer independent MP for Wills Phil Cleary. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui\n\nBy the final week, Labor\u2019s message came into focus as it used its financial might to blitz the seat with letterboxing and direct mail. One penned by Julia Gillard stuck tightly to the script: every seat lost helped Dutton become PM. Khalil still had PTSD from 2019, he said, when the ALP expected to win government and was beaten by Scott Morrison and his \u201cmiracle\u201d.\n\nPre-polling was relentless. I was at the Brunswick booth every day bar one, and Khalil and Ratnam were both there each day that I visited.\n\nAnd while pre-poll in Brunswick was always a theatre of democracy, sometimes it was also farce.\n\nTake Romeo \u2013 a One Nation volunteer whose surname I never learned \u2013 wandering the line with an Australian flag and sometimes, inexplicably, an Italian one too.\n\nHe would chant \u201cOne flag, One Nation\u201d. Could there be a suburb in Australia less welcoming to such sentiment than Brunswick? A man in a Collingwood jumper \u2013 notably Indigenous player Bobby Hill\u2019s number 23 \u2013 pelted him with eggs.\n\nRomeo shrugged it off, but a couple of days later when he told me someone had threatened to shoot him, he went home, fashioned two metal plates into an ad hoc bulletproof jacket he placed over his shirt, then returned to the booth.\n\nOne Nation volunteer, Romeo, with his armour.\n\nOne Nation\u2019s candidate got a 1 per cent swing, reaching 3.5 per cent of the primary vote. So it appears there\u2019s room for everyone in Australian democracy it seems \u2013 even in Brunswick.\n\nThis is the third time I\u2019ve covered one seat for an entire campaign like this. By the final days, it gives you clarity you don\u2019t expect when you start. You come to understand the jostling, the ground game, and how broader issues \u2013 war, climate, housing, the cost of a cup of coffee \u2013 land differently from one suburb to the next.\n\nIn the end, that moment in North Fitzroy \u2013 a Labor MP promising money for a bike path \u2013 was more than a local funding pledge. It was a case study in how politics still works here: tangible, transactional, and attentive to who turns up.\n\nThe Greens harnessed fury over Gaza. They tapped disillusionment on climate. They tried to create a wave to surf home \u2013 only to find Labor knew Dutton was a tsunami. And Labor, when threatened, can still marshall money, endorsements and machine-like discipline.\n\nWills didn\u2019t fall. But it shifted. Gaza cracked something open in the north where Labor\u2019s hold can no longer be assumed. The Greens are now within 2 per cent of taking this seat. If their candidate in the next election is weaker, maybe the margin returns to Labor. But in a seat named after a failed explorer, I suspect this electorate is ready to chart a new course \u2013 even if, this time, it decided to wait a little longer.",

Back home in Perth, it is impossible to escape from their day job.\n\nBoth brothers loved their upbringing in Perth and return whenever there is a viable gap in their schedule. Sydney can never replace the family and friends they miss, but it has given them a different perspective on their daily lives.\n\nEarlier this year, before signing their respective two-year contract extensions at the Sydney Swans, Chad and Corey Warner thought long and hard about what the club and the city meant to them.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely a benefit for us in Sydney here; you can go out with your mates, or go out for dinner, go to the beach, and you can just be a different person and not like an AFL player, and not have all the attention on you for a bit when you\u2019re away from the club. But it\u2019s definitely a reminder when you go back to Perth.\u201d\n\nCorey and Chad Warner at Swans headquarters before Saturday\u2019s game against Essendon. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nSince his breakthrough season in 2022 when he made the All-Australian squad, Chad has gradually become used to the level of interest in his career at home. The star midfielder seriously considered offers to move home to the Dockers and Eagles, but understood that his life would change dramatically.\n\n\u201cOn the weekend, we went out because Dad was over for the [Giants] game, and went out to the [Coogee] Pav to have a few beers, and you never do anything wrong, but I feel like [in] Perth they\u2019d be trying to find something that you\u2019re doing wrong, so that is really annoying,\u201d Chad said.\n\n\u201cEven coaches over there \u2013 I think at the moment the Freo coach [Justin Longmuir] is copping it a lot \u2013 and I think it\u2019s really, really tough in that regard, too, because fans are pretty ruthless over there. And I think a lot of the time they want to blame, and just want to keep blaming and blaming, and I think the coach at the moment is kind of falling victim to that a bit.\u201d",

    "text": "If a famous chef wanted to publish a cookbook that was actually useful, it might be called How to Cook When You Haven\u2019t Left Enough Time And Don\u2019t Know Where Anything Is.\n\nIt would have chapters titled: \u201cWhere\u2019s The F---ing Cornflour?\u201d and \u201cWhy Is the Person Who Hid the Cornflour Not Answering Their Phone?\u201d or \u201cWhat is Cornflour anyway and Can I Just Use Flour Instead?

Only, I Hate To Cook has been done. There are websites called \u201c57 Recipes\u201d, \u201c100 Super-Easy Healthy Dinners for People Who Hate to Cook\u201d.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Mia* was out for drinks with her colleagues in Brisbane\u2019s Fortitude Valley three years ago when her drink was spiked. She had switched to water about 10pm, not wanting to drink too much at the work event at a Brunswick Street Mall bar. But half an hour later, the then 24-year-old started feeling \u201csuper nauseous\u201d. \u201cEveryone was asking me if I was OK, if I had drunk too much. I was confused because I had stopped drinking,\u201d Mia recalls. She left the bar and returned to her office, where she collapsed at her desk. \u201cMy body felt really heavy. I could move, but my movements weren\u2019t very controlled. I don\u2019t think I could have stood up properly and walked unassisted without falling over.\u201d She called her partner to come pick her up, and made it home safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few days later, Mia decided to see a GP and ask for a drug test. It returned positive for benzodiazepines, a depressant drug with a sedative effect used to treat anxiety and insomnia. \u201cI suspected I was spiked because I\u2019ve been given benzodiazepines and reacted poorly to them in the past,\u201d she says. \u201cThey make me mentally foggy for a few days afterwards, which is how I was feeling.\u201d Loading It\u2019s uncommon for drink-spiking victims to have their experience validated by a toxicology test. \u201cA lot of people usually start piecing it together but then by the time they go [to get tested], it\u2019s too late for anything to realistically show up,\u201d she says. Health professionals say there is a narrow window to test for drugs. For most substances associated with drink spiking, the ideal timeframe is between 12 and 72 hours, though some drugs leave the body in as little as three hours. Some who believe they have been spiked will head to an emergency department, but Queensland Health say hospitals \u201cwill not routinely facilitate testing for drink spiking due to impact on treatment times\u201d. \u201cOur emergency departments treat patients based on their symptoms to ensure they receive the best care possible, and toxicology tests are generally not required to guide treatment,\u201d a spokesperson said. They can, however, refer patients to police for forensic testing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQueensland Police say that once a complaint is received, \u201can investigation will commence\u201d and testing will be organised if needed. In Queensland, emergency departments do not routinely test for drink spiking. Credit: Dion Georgopoulos The Alcohol and Drug Foundation chief executive Dr Erin Lalor AM says drink spiking has always been under-reported in Australia, with victims often fearful they\u2019ll be blamed for what happened, \u201cespecially if they were already drinking or taking other drugs\u201d. But what if there was a faster way to determine if a drink has been spiked, even before the victim or the perpetrator leaves a venue? Troy Stewart is the managing director of SureScreen Diagnostics Australia, the company behind a new rapid drink-spiking test. He believes these devices are the missing component to address the issue. The device is designed to detect drugs commonly associated with drink spiking, including GHB, ketamine and 22 types of benzodiazepines, within minutes, not hours. While no single test can guarantee a drink is safe, Stewart says SureScreen Diagnostics\u2019 technology has performed significantly better than other products, particularly with variables such as milk products and fruit juices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStewart has spent the last 12 months lobbying governments and other stakeholders to help stock the tests in venues across the country. In high-risk precincts, such as Fortitude Valley, he wants the government to fund a pilot trial that could see them distributed to every bar. Loading \u201cIf venues have these devices on hand, it means that anyone who suspects their drink has been tampered with can approach a staff member to have their beverage tested immediately,\u201d he says. In the New South Wales city of Albury, a trial of the devices in the area\u2019s clubs and pubs has seen early signs of success. Nine days after the trial began in February, patrons saw something being added to a woman\u2019s drink. \u201cThey reported that to security and security then very swiftly checked video footage and validated what they had seen,\u201d Albury Liquor Accord chair Craig Kidd says. \u201cThey approached the victim and took their drink to get tested. It returned a positive result \u2013 twice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKidd says the victim was taken to a hospital in Albury with the tests, where police were also called. NSW police used the security footage to identify the perpetrator, who was found and charged with possessing illicit substances. The Multi-Lined Rapid Beverage Test (MRBT) can detect over 20 substances commonly associated with drink spiking. Credit: Markus Ravik \u201cWe\u2019re hoping by having the drink spiking devices available during this trial, we can normalise that you should report it,\u201d Kidd says. Stewart has presented to Hervey Bay, Maryborough, Gympie, Bundaberg, Gladstone and Chinchilla liquor accords, and contacted Queensland\u2019s chief police, health, justice and youth ministers. He says they\u2019ve been receptive, but as yet, no Queensland cities have signed up for a trial like the one in NSW. Kidd says Albury\u2019s trial began in response to reports, largely spread across social media, about incidents of suspected drink spiking. \u201cThe local press picked up on that ... but it was really hard to quantify.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In August 2022, Caleb Harper was sitting in his underwear in a sweltering room in Los Angeles, willing the air-conditioner to work. The Spacey Jane frontman had just begun scribbling down the first lines of a song that would become August, the first track to emerge from their third album. But it wasn\u2019t coming easily in the 40-degree heat and the song ended up sitting on the shelf for about 18 months, Harper occasionally pulling it down to tweak a line here or there. Other songs came and were put to tape, the album was nearly tied up, but August remained out-of-reach. \u201cI had a counter melody that wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Harper says over Zoom from Los Angeles, air-conditioning working this time. \u201cI ended up writing it on the last morning, and Peppa [Lane, bassist] and I went in and sang it that day.\u201d That final counter melody carries out the track with the floating refrain \u201cif that makes sense?\u201c, which the band then lifted for the album\u2019s title. \u201cIt really bookends that period,\u201d Harper says, noting its meaning shifted considerably over the writing period, from a meditation on leaving Australia to predicting the beginning of a breakup. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard listen, honestly.\u201d Spacey Jane on stage in Melbourne in December 2021, after the breakout success of Booster Seat. Credit: Getty August, like the rest of If That Makes Sense, was written and recorded over two years in LA \u2013 the first time the Perth band had recorded outside Australia. It was a big deal for the quartet (Harper and Lane are joined by drummer Kieran Lama and guitarist Ashton Hardman-Le Cornu), who have been synonymous with the Australian indie rock scene since their jangly, vulnerable 2020 debut album Sunlight. Sunlight was borne from the runaway single Booster Seat, which reached #2 in that year\u2019s Hottest 100, behind Glass Animals\u2019 Heat Waves. The band would become frequent Hottest 100 lurkers: in the 2022 countdown, following their second album Here Comes Everybody, they featured six times, three of those coming in the top 10. In 2022, the band was the third-biggest seller of vinyl for the year, behind Taylor Swift and Harry Styles. They\u2019ve ridden this wave of popularity on numerous sold-out tours of the country, and are comfortable standalone headliners for the biggest local festivals. There aren\u2019t many bigger bands in Australian music right now, if any.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the gruelling touring schedule for Here Comes Everybody (which had really stretched back years to the start of Sunlight), the band\u2019s management stepped in and told them to take a break. \u201cIt started as quite a difficult thing,\u201d Harper says. \u201cIt was almost counterintuitive \u2026 We are a band that considers our job to play shows. It was almost like the music served that. Now we\u2019ve gone through a process of unlearning that and figuring out how to focus on making this record and pulling this world together first. And also giving the market a bit of space, from a business perspective. \u201cBut once we hopped off that train, we were all freaked out. Especially, because we were living all around the world, we didn\u2019t see each other as much.\u201d Like many Australian artists before him, Harper landed in LA and endured the merry-go-round of songwriting sessions \u2013 a process he called \u201cf---ing terrifying\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d always been protective of the songwriting process, and it always has been in my bedroom,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to advocate for ideas that I liked, and I didn\u2019t know how to say no to things I didn\u2019t like. I would often not put forward ideas at all because I was just like, \u2018If they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s embarrassing\u2019. But now I find it\u2019s liberating to have that conflict of ideas. I\u2019m grateful that I went through that transition.\u201d It\u2019s easy to understand Harper\u2019s apprehension. His lyrics have always been intensely personal, and the songs on If That Makes Sense feature some wrenching moments. On the churning single All the Noise, Harper reflects on his upbringing: \u201cAnd that was the way that they gave to me \u2026 A promise that I would hurt everybody that I ever meet\u201d. Then there\u2019s the shouted, tortured mantra in So Much Taller: \u201cYou\u2019ll never be enough and you\u2019ll never be loved, and the fact you tried is embarrassing enough\u201d. Recent single Through My Teeth obliquely references Harper shedding his religious upbringing and throwing himself headlong into partying at university. A lot of the album pulls in this direction and sifts through the various answers to the question: what happens when you have to drag your trauma into adulthood? \u201cBeing out here,\u201d Harper says after a pause, after we bring up Through My Teeth, \u201cit\u2019s almost like pulling myself out of my present life in Australia made the past compress, like the last 26 years of my life were all just in one accessible bank in a way that they hadn\u2019t been before\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden things didn\u2019t seem as far away \u2013 not that they were any clearer,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have trouble recalling much of my childhood, as I think a lot of people do, especially if they have negative things associated with that \u2026 Your brain tends to bury things or contort them. But I think a lot of it became far clearer or more in my face than it had been before.\u201d Being away from Australia pulled some things into focus, but it also brought with it a lot of homesickness and guilt. \u201cI think family is the main one,\u201d Harper answers, when I ask where the guilt comes from. \u201cThere\u2019s already a host of issues and contentious things there. Being away is an interesting escape from that. \u201cBut sometimes I take too much liberty when it comes to escaping things back home. Like I\u2019m really bad at messaging my friends back, I\u2019m really bad at calling my dad \u2026 and that\u2019s just something that weighs on me a lot. Relationships suffer, and you feel like it\u2019s your fault.\u201d \u2018We\u2019d be kicking ourselves if we didn\u2019t try [to break overseas].\u2019 Caleb Harper, frontman of Spacey Jane Sonically, If That Makes Sense doesn\u2019t deviate wildly from the Spacey Jane playbook, but the band have beefed things up considerably with undercurrents of synths and layers upon layers of guitars and vocals. It\u2019s the result of taking a longer time in the studio, and the presence of big-time producer Mike Crossey (Arctic Monkeys, the 1975, Wolf Alice). \u201cWe didn\u2019t shy away from producing it, like really producing it,\u201d Harper says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Let\u2019s put everything in here that we like and make it feel as big and wide as possible\u2019.\u201d The band also ran the entire record through tape at the end, a process that rounds out the sound and makes it feel richer, warmer (like the difference between an MP3 file and a vinyl record).\n\nAdvertisement",
