    "text": "Elon Musk, already the world's richest person, could become the first trillionaire after the Tesla board unveiled a massive new pay package for its CEO to keep his focus on the troubled EV maker.\n\nThe package would grant him additional shares of Tesla stock if the company is able to grow far beyond its current value, with a market capitalisation far greater than any company has ever approached. Musk's previous pay package, which added significantly to his massive wealth, also laid out ambitious growth plans that once appeared to be a reach \u2013 but which Tesla proved able to reach easily.\n\nThe new pay package could grant Musk 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock. Those shares would be worth $US143.5 billion ($218.6 billion) at today's stock value.\n\nElon Musk could become the world's first trillionaire if shareholders adopt a new proposal that would give him unprecedented sums of money if the company reaches certain ambitious milestones. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images via CNN Newsource)\n\nBut Musk would get those shares only if the value of Tesla stock increases significantly in coming years. The company stock would need to reach an overall value of $US8.5 trillion ($12.95 trillion) for Musk to get all the shares, significantly above the current market capitalisation of $US1.1 trillion ($1.68 trillion).\n\nThose 423.7 million new shares that Musk would get under this package would be worth close to $US1 trillion ($1.52 trillion) should the company hit the increased valuation targets spelled out in Friday's proxy statement.\n\nIf Tesla shares are able to reach the $US8.5 billion market capitalisation value, it could become the most valuable company ever. It would be worth roughly double the current market value of Nvidia (NVDA), the current most-valuable company on the market. Tesla is already the most valuable automaker by a large margin, even though legacy automakers, like second-most valuable automaker Toyota, sell far more vehicles and now make more profits.\n\nProposal for Tesla in invest in xAI\n\nThe company's proxy statement that laid out Musk's payment plan also included a shareholder proposal that Tesla take a stake in privately-held xAI, the artificial intelligence company that Musk also owns. That could help Elon Musk further consolidate his growing business empire.\n\nXAI recently purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which Musk bought for $US44 billion of his own money in 2022. The company did not take a position for or against that shareholder proposal, which does not give any details of how large a stake Tesla should take in xAI, and what price.\n\nBut any such investment could further enrich Tesla since Musk is the primary owner of xAI.\n\nREAD MORE: Fears accused killer Dezi Freeman could be down a mine shaft\n\nIf Tesla shares are able to reach the $US8.5 billion market capitalisation value, it could become the most valuable company ever. (AP)\n\nMusk currently owns 410 million shares of Tesla shares, worth $US139 billion at Thursday's closing price. That stake, along with his stakes in xAI, rocket company SpaceX, and several other companies he has started and runs, have made him the richest person on the planet, worth $US378 billion according to Bloomberg's billionaire tracker.\n\nHe currently has options to buy an additional 304 million shares of Tesla, but a judge in Delaware has twice struck down that 2018 pay package that granted him those options as illegal. Those rulings came despite overwhelming approval by Tesla shareholders \u2013 twice. The company again has tried to grant those options to Musk this year, and adding in those options, he now owns 18 per cent of the company's shares.\n\nTesla shares nearly doubled in value to a record-high price for its shares between election day and mid-December 2024, as investors bet that his close ties to US President Donald Trump would be a boon for Tesla. But as Tesla faced protests and dropping sales and falling profits in backlash to those ties (before he had a falling out with Trump), all those things resulted in Telsa's stock losing those gains. The shares have recovered some of those losses, but they are still down 26 per cent from the December peak.\n\nStill, Musk and his fans on Wall Street have insisted the company is well positioned to grow even larger and more successful in the future. He has continued to predict that his plans for self-driving cars \u2013 including a robotaxi service \u2013 will create massive profits and value for shareholders. The robotaxis would provide rides to passengers and also allow Tesla owners to rent out their cars for driverless rides when not in use.\n\nTesla shares nearly doubled in value to a record-high price for its shares between election day and mid-December 2024, as investors bet that his close ties to US President Donald Trump would be a boon for Tesla. (AP)\n\nMusk has also promised a line of humanoid robots that could bring in even more sales than Tesla's car business.\n\nKeeping Musk focused on Tesla\n\n\"It's a big pay package but Tesla needs to keep its biggest asset in Musk as CEO,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNN on Friday. Ives is one of the bigger Tesla bulls on Wall Street.\n\n\"In this AI era Musk now will drive its next leg of growth,\" Ives added. \"The Board had a $1 trillion decision and made the right one.\"\n\nThe board's proxy statement spoke of the importance of keeping Musk focused on Tesla going forward. In addition to his many business interests, he remains active in politics, despite his falling out with Trump. He has announced plans to form a third political party.\n\nTesla, in its proxy statement, warned that it needed to incentivise Musk to focus his attention on growing the company. It said that during the negotiations on the pay package, \"Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence if he did not receive such assurances.\"\n\nThe board said it \"believes that Mr Musk singularly possesses the leadership characteristics necessary to transform Tesla and realise its long-term mission at an unparalleled level\".\n\nMusk currently owns 410 million shares of Tesla shares, worth $US139 billion at Thursday's closing price. (AP)\n\nBut the company said it is also making plans for life after Musk, saying it is already working on succession plans. And it said that one of the terms of the employment package that Musk must meet to receive the final 70 million shares of stock is that he needs to have \"developed a framework for Chief Executive Officer succession\".\n\n\"The board regularly discusses management succession planning and leadership development,\" said the proxy statement. It said those succession plans are \"for both sudden, unanticipated events, in addition to longer-term planned succession for its executives\". It said it \"believes that management has developed a robust pipeline of seasoned leadership talent within Tesla,\" and that is also looking at possible external talent.\n\nMusk does not receive a cash salary from Tesla. All of his compensation comes from Tesla shares and options he has been granted in the past. Since there is still an ongoing court fight over the 304 million options, Musk has not received any compensation for nearly a decade, since a 2012 pay package made its last disbursement of options to him in 2017.\n\nBut not all tech billionaires receive additional stock options or grants as compensation, instead benefiting from the increased valuations of their existing stakes in their companies. That includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook. Both took large stakes in their companies as founders, but neither has received stock grants or options since those companies had initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively.\n\nTesla faced protests and dropping sales and falling profits in backlash to Musk's ties to Donald Trump. (Getty)\n\nIf Musk and his fans are right, Musk would become far wealthier even without any additional shares of Tesla stock. His current holdings of 410 million Tesla shares, even without the disputed 304 million options, would be worth nearly $US1 trillion more than today's valuation, should Tesla's market cap rise to $US8.5 billion.\n\nDespite promises, Tesla faces problems\n\nBut to achieve that target, it would have to start doing the things Musk is promising in terms of self-driving vehicles and its robotaxi. And that would mean meeting grand claims from a man and company that have often fallen short of their promises.\n\nTesla critics say that the stock has become grossly overvalued because of Wall Street's willingness to buy into Musk's vision of the future in terms of AI, self-driving vehicles and robots, despite its failures to deliver on past promises along those lines.\n\n\"Elon Musk has been saying since 2014 'we will have a fully autonomous car next year'. It hasn't happened, but that promise has been valued in the billions by Wall Street,\" said analyst Gordon Johnson, one of the harsher critics of Tesla. \"Elon Musk is a master manipulator. He's been able to keep the stock elevated. The reason the board is paying him is he's willing to say things that other CEOs aren't willing to say or get away with.\"\n\nThe richest man's relationship with the president eventually soured before he abandoned the administration. (AP)\n\nTesla is facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers. BYD, one of those Chinese automakers, is poised to pass Tesla for the most EV sales worldwide, even though it is not available for sale in the United States.\n\nTesla also faces competition from other companies that are ahead of it in providing robotaxi services, including Waymo, the autonomous vehicle unit of Google parent Alphabet, which has its own service and has partnered with Uber in some cities.\n\nAnd a change in US law is about to remove a $7500 tax credit for buyers of most electric vehicles, which could cause prices and sales of those vehicles to fall sharply.\n\nUS law also recently removed the billions of dollars in penalties that traditional automakers have had to pay if their gas-powered vehicles exceed emissions rules. The way that they avoided those payments in the past was by buying regulatory credits from an EV maker like Tesla. But the payments that brought billions in revenue to Tesla will now vanish.\n\nJohnson said that Tesla's stock price is therefore unlikely to hit the ambitious targets laid out in this Musk pay package.\n\nMusk has also promised a line of humanoid robots that could bring in even more sales than Tesla's car business. (AP)\n\n\"Things are going to get worse for them, not better,\" said Johnson. \"Is Tesla going to go to $8 trillion? Abso-f---ing-lutely not.\"\n\nShares of Tesla (TSLA) were up about 5 per cent in early trading on the news.",

It was our common love I suppose,\" Michael said.\n\nCallum was in Geelong, Victoria after spending years pursuing his winemaking dream interstate and abroad, while his father was in Western Australia's Great Southern region.\n\nIn 2021, the pair launched Fervor Wines and began independently making wines under the same label.\n\nMichael Garland and a young Callum at Garland's winery in Mount Barker.

(ABC News: Keane Bourke )\n\nThe government said it was the right choice to bring a \"team approach\" to a big portfolio, and experts largely agreed.\n\nSo, has it worked having five ministers working under the same umbrella? It depends on who you ask.\n\nDivision of Labor\n\nIf the past two months have demonstrated anything, it's that Ms Hammat has a tough job \u2014 even with a lightened workload.\n\nA worse-than-expected flu season combined with our ageing population forced the Department of Health's hand to reschedule over 100 elective surgeries in August following \"unprecedented\" emergency department demand.\n\nThe state then recorded back-to-back record ambulance ramping figures.\n\nWA sets new ambulance ramping record Western Australia again breaks the state record for the amount of time ambulances spent ramped outside hospitals, despite more than 100 elective surgeries being postponed to ease pressure.\n\nAmid this came a barrage of questions over the state of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Nedlands.\n\nIt resulted in the government coughing up $50 million for maintenance at WA's ageing hospitals.\n\nHaving a seasoned minister like John Carey, already used to dealing with his tricky housing portfolio, copping the flak for infrastructure issues would have eased the load on Ms Hammat.\n\nBut the WA opposition hasn't seen the distribution of the vast portfolio as a sign of leadership.\n\n\"By spreading it around, what they've also done is spread the blame,\" opposition leader Basil Zempilas said.\n\nWA opposition leader Basil Zempilas says the government needs to do more to ease the health crisis.

(ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"It's tough, we know it's tough, but my government is up for the challenge,\" a confident Roger Cook told reporters in Exmouth on Friday.\n\nLikewise, a government spokesperson said a team of ministers with a \"laser-like focus on different aspects\" of health was \"the best way\" to address complex challenges.\n\n\"Together, under the leadership of Health Minister Meredith Hammat, we're strengthening our health system by investing in hospitals and increasing our health workforce, and we are spearheading reforms to tackle ambulance ramping,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n'Trapped' in winter cycle\n\nTerry Slevin, an adjunct professor and chief executive officer of the Public Health Association of Australia, thinks the division of health is a good idea.\n\nWA patient devastated as complex surgery cancelled day before Photo shows A woman sits in her home, being interviewed A patient caught up in the immense pressure being placed on WA hospitals says her planned surgery being cancelled has put her under significant stress and eroded her trust in the health system.\n\n\"Roger Cook knows the extraordinary complexity of the health portfolio, he's had to wrestle with it,\" Mr Slevin said.\n\n\"So having broken it up into more chewable chunks means all of those people can focus on each of those big challenges \u2014 mental health, infrastructure, prevention, research \u2014 and they can give it greater attention and engage with the people who have the best ideas.\"\n\nMr Slevin says it's still \"relatively early days\" and the ministry needs more time to become a well-oiled machine, and called for a review after 18 months to two years.\n\nHe's naturally the most interested in Sabine Winton's portfolio \u2014 preventative health \u2014 and thinks she could be doing more to foster healthier communities to prevent ED presentations.\n\n\"If we're going to deal with the ambulance ramping, the queues for clinical services in the future, the time to start is now with regard to dialling that demand down,\" he said.\n\nTerry Slevin says the integrated approach may take time to bear fruit. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nDr Hoath echoed the sentiment.\n\n\"We get very trapped in this cycle of ramping, of winter, of vaccine, the crisises we hit, rather than taking a step back and trying to prevent the problem from getting bigger,\" Dr Hoath said.\n\nThe government insists Ms Winton is focused on this through things like vaccinations, but peak groups want more tangible results to point to.\n\nTime needed\n\nFrom a patient perspective, stronger connection between state and federal health ministers is also urgent.\n\n\"The state government has a number of levers and they are important, but I think that what we need to see is our governance mechanisms joining up to actually understand the community's perspective on the ground,\" Health Consumers Council Executive Director Clare Mullen said.\n\nAugust saw WA set another unwanted record for ambulance ramping. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nMs Mullen says this looks like consumers more \"actively involved\" in the early stages of decision making in hospital infrastructure projects, for example.\n\nIf a grace period is given to the government, its still got time to iron out the kinks.\n\nBut with an opposition quick to seize on any missteps, it might want to nip issues in the bud sooner rather than later.\n\nLoading...",

(Getty Images: AFL Photos: Michael Willson)\n\nFyfe has been plagued by injuries in the latter part of his glittering career.\n\nThis year alone he dealt with knee, hamstring and calf issues, admitting that he thought he may not be able to come back on numerous occasions.\n\n\"The game tried many different times to tell me the end of the road was near and so I walk away knowing this was definitely the right time,\" Fyfe said.\n\n\"I think I came to a point last year where I felt like I'd turned every stone, given absolutely everything I could.\n\n\"Where the story went from there was out of my hands. Hopefully I get some closure and peace of mind that this part of my journey with Fremantle \u2014 I did everything I could.\n\n\"I finish disappointed in some ways because of the way this season went.

(ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nThrough its Remote Communities Fund, the WA government has set aside close to $20 million to improve 22 homes across three Martu communities: Punmu, Parnngurr, and Kunawarritji.\n\nAccording to the Department of Housing and Works, 62 total houses make up these settlements, although one community might accommodate upwards of 800 people for cultural events.\n\nIt also intends to build new homes in Jigalong, of rabbit-proof fence fame, where it has entered a housing management agreement.\n\nLikewise, the federal government has pledged $50 million to repair homes in remote Indigenous communities across the country between 2025 and 2030.\n\nEdith Costello says the community has been waiting a long time for investment in housing. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)\n\nMs Costello says extreme construction costs render the current amount of investment a drop in the ocean for the Western Desert.\n\nThat is why Punmu is carving its own path forward.\n\n\"The community's been waiting a very, very long time for any action to be made to renew the housing,\" she explains.\n\n\" We're dealing with people whose life expectancy is 39 \u2026 and housing is just a basic right. \"",

    "text": "A 47-7 defeat to England has failed to dampen the spirits of Australia's rugby women, who are marching to the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals.\n\nThe Wallaroos had to avoid a 76-point defeat by the rampant tournament favourites to book their place in the last eight and their excellent, ferocious first-half display in Brighton on Saturday (Sunday AEST) effectively ensured that grim prospect was never really on the cards.\n\nInstead, in front of a 30,000-strong crowd including the Princess of Wales, the Australians were left celebrating the chance to cause an upset in next Saturday's (Sunday AEST) quarterfinal against Canada, the world's number two side who had earlier beaten Scotland 40-19 in Exeter to maintain their unbeaten record.\n\n\"We are really happy with the performance \u2014 especially in that first half, we really gave it to them \u2014 and we're just going to stick with those positives,\" said skipper Siokapesi Palu, who led her Australians excellently.\n\nThe Wallaroos went into the final game of the pool knowing exactly what they had to do.\n\nThe United States needed to beat Samoa by as many points as possible to have a chance of advancing, and they beat the Pacific nation 60-0 in York.\n\nLed by a four-try performance from Freda Tafuna, the Americans led by 27-0 at half-time, and went on to score 10 tries without reply.\n\nHowever, Australia's big points differential lead meant the Wallaroos would have had to lose by 76 points against England, without scoring a bonus point, to miss out.\n\nDespite coach John Mitchell, the former All Blacks' mentor, declaring that England aimed to be ruthless hunters, the hosts were taken aback by how the Wallaroos came at them early on with hooker Adiana Talakai ploughing over for the sixth-minute try from a driving maul that really eased their job.\n\nThe Aussies needed to score four tries, or lose by less than seven points, to earn the bonus point that would have guaranteed their progression and for the first half-an-hour, that didn't even seem wholly out of the question as they still led the world's number one side, who now haven't lost a Test in a record-equalling 30 matches.\n\nThat superb opening, featuring real resilience in defence and enterprise in attack, proved absolutely critical in their bid to ensure their points difference ended up 35 points better than the Americans, even though there felt an inevitability that England, after a scrappy opening, would eventually start wearing them down.\n\nEngland finally hit the front with three tries before the break from Jess Breach \u2014 on her 50th appearance \u2014 Abbie Ward and Sadia Kabeya, and as Australia began to tire amid the wave of attacks from the hosts after halftime, further scores followed from Kabeya, a double from Kelsey Clifford and Sarah Bern.\n\nYet despite conceding seven tries in total at the Brighton & Hove Albion Stadium, the side coached by former England player Jo Yapp never really looked like conceding the avalanche of points that would have consigned them to an early exit.\n\nYapp, who's leaving as coach after the tournament, said: \"I don't know if the scoreline was a fair reflection, but in the second half we lost momentum, we lost a couple of key set-pieces and then we were on the back foot. Credit to England, they capitalised on that.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"But the positive thing is we created opportunities, got field position, just we couldn't execute. I'm proud of the first half, the way we took it to them.\"\n\nThe Australians finished second in pool A, and will now face Canada in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe Scots came second in pool B and will now face England in the last eight.\n\nIt's going to be a tall order against Canada, who beat the Wallaroos 45-7 in their Pacific Four Series clash in Brisbane in May.\n\n\"We know what to expect, we'll preview them this week and we'll focus on ourselves,\" Yapp said.\n\nAAP/ABC",

(ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nOverpriced sheep stations\n\nRandal says the price of sheep stations is wildly overpriced at about $70 to $75 per acre, which affects the profitability for the next generation.\n\n\"If you borrow money on that, you can't make enough to pay the interest. So it makes it very hard for the next generations to get started,\" he said.\n\nSturt's Meadows Station is the size of Singapore. (ABC Broken Hill: Katherine Spackman)\n\nWhen Randal took over from his own father, Peter, he paid him a certain amount of money and then an ongoing lease figure.\n\n\"When it came time to do it with Sam, we did it slightly differently. He paid me a certain amount of money, which was more, but then with no lease,\" he said.\n\n\"So I've got enough money to live on, but he doesn't have to pay me lease payments anymore.\n\n\" But he did have to take over the ongoing lease payments to my parents because it's a generational thing. \"\n\nRandal said he wanted to hand over the running of the station to Sam so the young father had the means to employ a governess.\n\nSix-year-old Harvey Beven with governess Matilda Raphael, who moved to the station at the start of the year.

    "text": "Have you wondered how the Reserve Bank of Australia came up with its \"2-3 per cent\" target for inflation?\n\nDo you like what's happened to property prices in the inflation-targeting era?\n\nLast week, the RBA published a fascinating and candid interview with Stephen Grenville.\n\nAustralian economy grows 1.8pc Photo shows Welder works at InQuik Engineering in Newcastle. The Australian economy has grown slightly faster than economists were expecting thanks to a dramatic increase in household spending.\n\nDr Grenville worked at the RBA between 1982 and 2001 (his last five years as deputy governor).\n\nHe was at the RBA when it adopted its inflation target in the early 1990s and asserted its right to move interest rates up and down without political interference.\n\nIn his interview, Dr Grenville talked about the RBA's ongoing struggle to know what to do about asset prices, including property prices.\n\nHe said Australia's inflation-targeting framework still had unresolved issues.\n\nBut does he think inflation targeting has worked well?\n\n\"We had two decades where it worked well and one decade where, in my view, it didn't work so well,\" he said. \"It worked well until 2010 [\u2026] \"[But] it shouldn't get too much of the blame for its less good performance in the third decade, and there's still a lot to be said for it. \"[It] still looks to me to be the best we can do.\"\n\nWhen did the interview occur?\n\nDr Grenville's interview is part of the RBA's new oral history collection of interviews with former governors and deputy governors.\n\nYou can read the transcript of his interview here.\n\nKeep in mind it was recorded in June 2023. At that point, inflation had only just started to decline from its recent post-COVID peak.\n\nWhere did the RBA get its inflation-targeting idea from?\n\nIn his interview, Dr Grenville said the story of inflation targeting starts with New Zealand.\n\n\"New Zealand is a pioneer of lots of things, and you have to admire them that they think up the good ideas,\" he said. \"[It] was the pioneer [of inflation targeting] and gets the credit for putting it in place, but it wasn't the model for us. \"The country at that stage was run by management experts, and they wanted to assign an objective to each instrumentality, and that was the origin of inflation targeting. \"But because of the people at their central bank \u2212 particularly the Governor Don Brash \u2212 they had the very strongly free market, sharp edged view that inflation was always caused by money. \"They saw the simple link between money and prices, so they got that going very late in the 1980s or in the early 1990s \u2212 I don't recall the exact date now \u2212 but they were ahead of everyone, and because they were only just 'over the ditch', we were obviously exposed to them. \"We knew them all well and liked them, so we more or less immediately started thinking about what we would do.\"\n\nWhy did the RBA choose a 2-3 per cent target for inflation?\n\nHe said New Zealand picked an inflation target of 0-2 per cent, but senior officials at the RBA thought that was misguided.\n\nThe RBA wanted a different target.\n\nTrump's authoritarian style is targeting the Federal Reserve Photo shows FILE PHOTO: Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Novi, Michigan Donald Trump's declaration that, \"I have the right to do anything I want\", didn't get the attention it deserved.\n\nHe said inflation targets that contemplate getting to zero \u2014 or think that being at, or near, zero is a good thing \u2014 simply misunderstand the nature of inflation.\n\nHe said economies \"work much better with a little bit of inflation so that relative prices can change\".\n\nAnd quality improvements and lots of technical issues meant that \"zero makes no sense\".\n\n\"So that end of the New Zealand target was wrong,\" he said. \"They were also, we thought, \u2018inflation nutters\u2019 in that they thought inflation was the only thing that mattered.\"\n\nHe said at the time, when RBA officials were considering adopting an inflation target for Australia, they didn't think they could get Australia's inflation down to 2 per cent, but they still wanted to be ambitious.\n\nThat's how they stumbled upon a \"2-3 per cent\" target.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the rate of inflation was [in Australia], but it was much higher than 3 [per cent]. It was 4 or 5 [per cent], or maybe even higher,\" he said. \"We knew we'd had 'the recession we had to have' and we were going to make a lot of progress on inflation, but we didn't think we'd get much below 3 [per cent]. \"We thought to mention 2 [per cent], which by then some other central bankers were talking about, and of course was the top of the New Zealand target. \"[So] 2 would be too ambitious, but 3 would sound like we weren't trying hard enough, so we suggested 2 to 3 [per cent, but] not as a range, and this was something we had a lot of trouble explaining. \"We didn't think we would stay within 2 to 3 [per cent], because we really thought of it as \u2212 I think Glenn [Stevens] invented the term \u2212 a 'thick point'. \"We just wanted people to be saying: well, if we had a number starting with 2, most of the time we would regard that as a satisfactory outcome. \"So that's one advance, as we saw it, over the New Zealand inflation targeting.\"\n\nHas inflation targeting worked well in Australia?\n\nDr Grenville said inflation targeting worked well in Australia for two decades.\n\nThe 'golden era' of economic reform wasn't all rosy Photo shows For sale sign on Queenslander-style house that needs renovating in a street in Brisbane.

He knows major policy changes can have unintended consequences.\n\nBut it didn't work as well after the global financial crisis of 2007-09.\n\nHe said the GFC left a \"huge legacy of damage and headwinds\" and Australia's growth performance wasn't great in the 2010s.\n\nHe said as inflation kept falling in the 2010s, the RBA faced constant pressure to keep cutting rates, even though the economic returns from cutting rates below a certain low level are questionable.\n\nBut the problem was, even though inflation was too low everyone said, 'Oh, that must be because your interest rate is still too high.\"\n\n\"Glenn [Stevens] was Governor then, and he took interest rates down quite smartly when it was clear that the mineral boom was ending, and he took them down to 2 per cent very quickly. \"Now a 2 per cent policy rate is essentially zero in real terms \u2212 that is, inflation adjusted terms \u2014 so he did what seems to me to be the sensible thing: you respond, but he hung on at 2 per cent, [even if] inflation was still too low. \"Worse still, unemployment rose. \"Unemployment \u2026 had risen during the GFC, then fell to 5 per cent immediately after the GFC, [then] it went up to 6 per cent, and this was despite a policy rate which was zero, or maybe even negative, in inflation-adjusted terms. \"[None] of that seemed to stir the economy along, and my own view is that there are other forces holding back the economy, and that it was unhelpful to push interest rates down even further into negative in inflation-adjusted terms, even though America was down and by that stage had zero nominal terms.\"\n\nAn unresolved issue with inflation-targeting\n\nHowever, he said that experience in the 2010s did expose a problem with Australia's inflation-targeting framework.\n\nHe said the framework encourages policymakers to keep cutting rates as inflation keeps falling, regardless of how low interest rates are getting.\n\nHe said people needed to realise that monetary policy had its limits, and if we keep cutting rates below a certain point it can cause economic problems, especially with property prices.\n\n\"A low interest rate does very little for activity, for real GDP growth, but it has a big effect on asset prices like houses and shares,\" he said. \"[Asset inflation] may make people feel good and for house owners, it gives them something to talk about at the dinner parties about how their house price has gone up, [and that] makes everyone feel good; maybe that would stimulate the economy a bit, but I just regard that as such a weird way of stimulating the economy by giving people a big hit to their asset prices. \"I was not attracted to that channel of monetary policy, and thought instead of pushing further and further down to essentially see a zero real [interest rate ] \u2014 or in other words, [an] inflation-adjusted [interest rate] somewhere around 2 or 1.5 per cent \u2014 as being the place to stop and admit, in public, that monetary policy was still working strongly at that low interest rate, but that it was doing all it could do. \"This was like medicine: you took the tablets that the doctor recommended and it didn't completely fix you, but there was no point in doubling the dose in the hope that that would completely fix you, it just made you worse [\u2026] \"I think that's an unresolved issue of the inflation targeting framework [it encourages policymakers to go on reducing interest rates whenever inflation is too low]. \"I don't think it actually mattered that inflation was running at 1.5 per cent \u2212 we weren't deflating, so we could have just not worried about it \u2212 but because you've signed on so rigorously to inflation targeting, it's very hard to say \u2018Oh look, conditions are a bit different now, 1.5 is okay, isn't it? Who's being harmed by 1.5 per cent inflation? There's no deflation which might be harmful, but 1.5 per cent is fine. Let's just wait until the business sector regains its mojo'.\"\n\nWhat can the RBA do about property prices?\n\nHe said the RBA had also never quite known what to do about asset prices within the inflation-targeting framework, which complicates things.\n\n\"I think there's one other problem which we always knew about but didn't know what to do about, and that is asset prices, which were particularly a serious problem in this period because interest rates had been taken down so low,\" he said. \"It was always a problem that asset prices move much, much, much faster than inflation. \"Say inflation goes up from say 2 to 3 [per cent], but asset prices are going up to 5, 10 and 15 [per cent] for housing prices, so any interest rate which would contain asset price increases would be much too severe, much too high for normal activity, so there is no good resolution. \"Some people say, \u2018oh, well, you give the task to [the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]\u2019; [but] that would be essentially giving the task of macro policy to the macro prudential regulator and at the moment they don't have that mandate, so they don't do that. \"I think that would be a very big change of the system.\"\n\nIn the 26 months since Dr Grenville's interview was recorded, Australia's headline inflation has declined to 2.1 per cent and underlying inflation has fallen to 2.7 per cent.\n\nHouse prices again on the march Photo shows a house for sale in the brisbane suburb of stafford with the sale sign in the front yard With housing affordability now improving as interest rates come down, housing accessibility is likely to worsen further as prices again rise.\n\nThe RBA has cut the cash rate target from 4.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent.\n\nThis year, average house prices also passed $1 million for the first time.\n\nDomain has also forecast Australian property prices to jump to fresh record highs in 2025-26, creating more pain for first-home hopefuls.\n\nIn June, it said the median house price in Sydney was forecast to jump by 7 per cent in 2025-26, to a staggering $1.83 million by June 2026.",

    "text": "Driving in the Bathurst 1000 was supposed to be the highlight of Renee Gracie's motorsport career.\n\nIn 2015, the now 30-year-old formed part of the first all-female line-up in two decades to compete in the iconic event.\n\nBut after crashing into the Forrest's Elbow wall on lap 15, Gracie would hit an all-time low.\n\nAt first she kept a low profile in Melbourne, where she had moved to pursue her V8 career, before travelling back to Queensland to see family for Easter the following year.\n\nIn 2015, Simona De Silvestro and Renee Gracie were the first women's team in 20 years to compete in the Bathurst 1000. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nUnable to afford flights, she asked for fuel vouchers from her sponsor to make the almost 2,000-kilometre journey home.\n\nBusting to go to the toilet, she stopped at a competitor's fuel station, only to be photographed by a fan, who posted the images on social media and tagged Gracie.\n\n\"By the time I got home, about six hours later, my phone had been ringing non-stop and management was losing it at me, saying I wasn't thinking and I was an idiot,\" Gracie told ABC Sport.\n\n\"I remember thinking, I don't have to put up with this \u2026 I should just be able to go to the toilet when I need to without repercussions.\n\n\"That was the moment for me when I literally cut it off, and was like 'I'm done'.\"\n\nGracie crashed the car on lap 15 of her first Bathurst 1000 race. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nIt was also the catalyst for a dramatic change of direction, and to Gracie's surprise as much as anyone, a lucrative OnlyFans career.\n\nAt first, Gracie chose to stay in Melbourne, relying on contacts for jobs in the car industry, but was unable to make ends meet.\n\n\"I remember sitting in my apartment with no lights on, rent due. I had no dining table, no furniture, no nothing, because I was so broke,\" Gracie said.\n\n\" Without being too graphic, I had some very deep, dark thoughts about if I was even worthy of being here. \"\n\nOn a whim, Gracie packed her things into the back of her Mustang and drove to Queensland to move in with her dad.\n\n\"From 14 years old, I had a Plan A only, and Plan A was to race cars,\" Gracie said.\n\n\"I didn't have a Plan B, so when I moved back home, I had nothing, and I mean I had zero dollars and zero cents to my name.\n\n\"I just knew, being at home and having that reset, that this was my opportunity to start again, and keep going.\"\n\nThis is how OnlyFans helped Gracie turn a career of sexualisation and sexism into monetary success, stability, and a triumphant return to GT3 (grand tourer) racing.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nDads didn't want sons 'beaten by a girl'\n\nBorn on the Gold Coast, Gracie never aspired to a motorsport career.\n\nA spur-of-the-moment go-karting trip on Hamilton Island, where 14-year-old Gracie lapped and out-paced her father, changed that.\n\n\"The mechanic [at the race track] ended up saying to Dad: 'I just want to let you know that this is something you don't want to sleep on. She might actually have something; she's kind of talented',\" Gracie said.\n\nGracie then proceeded down the well-worn path of junior go-karting, describing local races as \"fun and playful\".\n\nBut once on the national circuit she attracted unwanted attention; especially from competitors' fathers.\n\n\"I would take my helmet off after a practice session, and one of the dads would say: 'you can't let her beat you. You can't let a girl beat you',\" she said.\n\n\"I think for the dads, I was at risk of taking something from their sons they so desperately wanted, which was a career in motorsport.\"\n\nGracie had aspirations to race cars from the age of 14. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nSeventeen-year-old Gracie soon became the first woman to compete in the Carrera Cup in 2013, but describes her first year as \"really, really, really\" hard.\n\nShe made a deliberate effort to make friends with other drivers to avert a gnawing sense of alienation.\n\n\"I wanted to show them that I'm actually a normal person, that they didn't need to bully me or be mean to me,\" Gracie said.\n\nGracie's weight and appearance scrutinised\n\nBy 2014, Gracie had finished in the top 10 of the Cup five times, earning her a spot as the first full-time female V8 Supercars driver in 14 years.\n\nBut as attention on her performance increased, her image was increasingly scrutinised.\n\n\"I had to report my weight in an email check in every week,\" she said.\n\nIn 2025, Supercar drivers must maintain a minimum weight of 95kg, including any apparel.\n\nIf they are lighter, a ballast is fitted to their car to bring the weight up to that number.\n\n\"I was told certain haircuts made my face look chubby, certain colours were unflattering, or to wear high heels so I looked better,\" Gracie added.\n\nGracie says she was consistently told there is no place for women in motorsport. (Supplied: Renee Gracie)\n\nShe argues that unsolicited feedback on her appearance was relentless.\n\n\"All of that was the making of me as a sex symbol while ensuring I didn't believe it,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that was part of the plan; to build me up while making sure my confidence was low and it didn't go to my head.\"\n\nGracie says she was made to feel \"undesirable\" because she was a tomboy who did not conform to conventional feminine norms.\n\n\"My belief [was] that I was overweight and ugly, and that no-one would want to race with me because I was an unattractive female who is competitive,\" she said.\n\nGracie says she had extremely low self-esteem, with her appearance constantly scrutinised. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nShe was also consistently told there was \"no place for women in the sport\".\n\n\"I had team owners and managers say directly to my face: 'there's no way we'll ever have a female driver in our car,\" she said.\n\n\"I've had people say that a female would upset the team dynamic, and I'd distract the boys.\n\n\"They weren't one-offs, they were constant comments throughout my entire career.\"\n\nGracie says she was used to market Bathurst 1000 for free\n\nDespite the consistently negative feedback on her appearance, Gracie said she was called on to do \"months\" of unpaid publicity in the lead-up to the Bathurst 1000 alongside teammate Simona de Silvestro.\n\n\"I think the idea was that we were two girls, and sex sells, so we'd make them heaps of money,\" she said.\n\nGracie says she did months of unpaid publicity ahead of the Bathurst 1000 in 2015. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nGracie said that not only was she not paid for marketing, she was not paid for participating in the event either.\n\n\"People were coming up to me at the race going 'you must be living the life as a professional race car driver', but I literally had negative $50 in my bank account,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd comfortably say that I'd be surprised if anyone else wasn't paid, except me.\"\n\nThe ABC contacted Gracie's former team Tickford Racing (then Prodrive Racing Australia) to verify this claim, but did not receive a response.\n\nA Supercars spokesperson, meanwhile, said \"commercial arrangements for drivers are managed directly between teams, drivers and their representatives\", and that Gracie's manager had collaborated with a Supercars team to \"secure the car and financial backing required\".\n\nAdding salt to the wound, Gracie remembers being berated by her team after the oil-slick induced crash that severely damaged their Ford FG X Falcon.\n\nGracie on a practice lap in the Supergirls Falcon during the Bathurst 1000 in 2015. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\n\"I got into a lot of trouble because of how expensive it was going to be [to repair],\" she said.\n\n\"I was like 'what are you worried about? I'm a racing car driver, I made a mistake'. That didn't sit right with me.\n\n\" While it was meant to be one of the greatest moments of my life, it was also the most stressful, chaotic and traumatising time of my life, all at the same time. \"\n\nShe describes it as the \"beginning of the end\" of her career, which led to the fateful trip back to the Gold Coast \u2014 and OnlyFans.\n\nHow OnlyFans restored Gracie's self-esteem\n\nLiving at home with her dad, Gracie said she was kept afloat by the kindness of fans who would write to ask when she would return to racing.\n\nThen came the suggestion she start an OnlyFans account, something Gracie had to Google.\n\nOnlyFans is a social media network where creators (including sex workers, athletes, musicians and more) sell content to their subscribers.\n\n\"My fans would make cheeky comments like 'I'd pay to see you take your top off',\" she said.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nGracie happened to know someone who had an account, and asked if she could see it.\n\n\"It was like an Instagram feed, but with photos that were a little more risqu\u00e9, a bit more sexualised, nothing crazy, and I was like 'I can do that',\" she said.\n\nTen minutes later, Gracie had signed up and posted her first bikini shot, albeit not from a place of self-confidence.\n\n\"I was still in the mindset of not loving and not appreciating myself,\" she said.\n\n\"I was proud of who I was at the core. I knew deep down I was a good person, I was motivated, hard-working, a good friend \u2026 but externally, I thought I was a 2 out of 10.\n\nThe kindness of fans kept Gracie afloat in her darkest days. (GT World Challenge Australia/Jack Martin Photography: Jack Martin)\n\n\"So when the fans kept messaging and asking me for content, I thought, 'well, if you're gonna pay for it, that's on you buddy, no refunds'.\n\n\"It was kinda like, 'sucked in for you paying money to see this because I'm ugly, fat and awful'. That was my belief.\"\n\nAfter a career being told she was undesirable, Gracie said OnlyFans restored her self-esteem.\n\n\"Weirdly it gave me confidence because I had none, if that makes sense.\n\nOnlyFans gave Gracie the confidence she needed to get back into motor racing. (GT World Challenge Australia/Jack Martin Photography: Jack Martin)\n\n\"With a flick of a switch, I was like, 'what am I so worried about? I must not be as bad as I thought if people are reassuring me'.\n\n\"Actually getting acknowledgement and recognition was exactly what I needed, especially after being in the place I was in.\"\n\nAt no point did Gracie feel ambivalent about the move, arguing \"money talks\".\n\n\"The money was insane, so in my opinion, everyone else [and their opinions] could get f***ed. I didn't care,\" she said.\n\nThe long road back to motorsport\n\nFinally in a more stable place financially, and emboldened by her successful business venture, Gracie made the choice to return to motorsport in 2021.\n\nGracie returned to motorsport in 2021 and has made great gains since. (GT World Challenge Australia/Race Project: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nShe describes two difficult years of \"closed doors, unanswered phone calls and emails\".\n\nIt took a trip to the US, where she had a chance encounter with an OnlyFans staff member, to make the return a reality.\n\n\"I was at a content event, and I just said in passing, as a joke, 'you guys should sponsor me so I can go back to racing', and he said, 'absolutely, send me an email'.\"\n\nIn 2023, Gracie made a triumphant return to the GT World Challenge circuit, winning the Australian GT Trophy.\n\nIn 2023, Renee Gracie secured the Trophy Series in GT World Challenge Australia. (GT World Challenge Australia/Race Project: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nIn 2025, she once again leads the Am category, describing it as a \"dream\" return.\n\n\"I couldn't have scripted it better,\" she said.\n\n\"It's honestly been the best part of my life.\"\n\nGracie attributes that change to a new-found maturity, while she is also self-managed.\n\n\"I can handle situations differently now, and being able to steer the ship myself, as an older woman who has been successful in something else [made the biggest difference],\" she said.\n\nThat does not mean it has been all smooth sailing, with Gracie saying she had a \"lukewarm\" reception at first.\n\nGracie with teammate Paul Stokell in 2024. (GT World Challenge Australia/Race Project: Daniel Kalisz)\n\n\"I think people were a bit hesitant, like 'which Renee are we going to get?',\" she said.\n\n\"People sort of had two perspectives of me: either Renee who had a bit of a treacherous falling out with the sport, or the OnlyFans Renee. I think they were scared I was going to walk around with dildos in my hands.\n\n\"But once I started I think they realised I was actually the best version of Renee.\"\n\nSexism in motorsport may not have changed\n\nThere were other hiccups, too. In her first year on the circuit, and leading the championship, Gracie's car was conspicuously absent from TV coverage.\n\n\"I was completely cut out to the point where fans were writing in to [the broadcaster] and saying it was a disgrace,\" she said.\n\nWhile Gracie was reluctant to speculate on why, she said it was \"pretty obvious\" that it was because of her sponsor.\n\nGracie says Europe has embraced her and her team. (GT World Championship Australia/Jack Martin Photography: Jack Martin)\n\nShe said things have changed for the better since GT3 split from under the Supercars banner, but stopped short of saying the culture of motorsport has improved.\n\n\"I wish I could say it has changed, but I think it's only because I'm in a new category, with younger management, that I'm so accepted,\" Gracie said.\n\nShe said GT3 racing has the advantage of being a global sport, with Europe embracing her.\n\n\"They don't care if a car is sponsored by OnlyFans, because sex isn't as taboo, and the culture is more liberated [in Europe],\" Gracie said.\n\nRenee Gracie driving in the GT3. (GT World Challenge Australia/Race Project: Daniel Kalisz)\n\nBut while she is pessimistic about the culture of motorsport more broadly, she would still encourage young girls to pursue their racing dreams.\n\n\"Don't let anybody tell you what to do. If it's your burning desire to do something, do it. If, someone tells you no, find someone who will tell you yes,\" Gracie said.\n\n\"My biggest lesson is that it's OK to be told no, but you don't have to take no for an answer if you want it enough.\"",

Without it, the first three can look staid and predictable.\n\nKatharine Kent, as she preferred to be known, and who died on Friday at the age of 92, had style in spades, which is all the more fascinating because she was such a retiring person.

But when you\u2019re old, it keeps your face from collapsing.\n\nSweet but poised, even in early photographs where there are echoes of the youthful Grace Kelly in her dainty, blonde beauty and gracefulness, the duchess favoured simple, uncluttered necklines.

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen GP Melanie Mapleson noticed a lump above her collarbone, she went and got it checked immediately and waited for her results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those days prior to the diagnosis when I'd felt the symptoms but hadn't got any answers, they were some of the worst days of my life\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a doctor herself, the 38-year-old knew there could be something seriously wrong, and what she was diagnosed with shocked her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mind was jumping to the worst possible case scenario and the worst conclusions, even though they were all hypothetical at that stage. So everything stopped. I stopped working. I basically just went into - sort of withdrew into - a state of numbness and just got all the necessary investigations and then was told by my lovely GP that I had Hodgkin's lymphoma.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter being diagnosed with cancer, Ms Mapleson heard about radiotherapy as a treatment option, but she was worried about potential side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou go on deep dives when you're diagnosed with something like this, it's hard to resist the temptation to go and look at every possible source of information, even those that are most unreliable. And so it wasn't so much the team that was giving me misinformation, they were very clear on the fact that the radiotherapy would be a critical integral component of my cure. But some of the information that I was channelling through was incorrect. And I think that's where my fear was based, you know, around side effects and late effects and being radioactive. And I had a young child, so I was afraid of putting him at risk and all of that was really completely non-factual, but that's what the mind settled on when you're in a place of uncertainty and fear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Mapleson decided to go ahead with radiation therapy as part of her treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI turned up, got changed, lay down on the examination bed, and then was there for about 10, 15 minutes just lying there very, very still. And then I left. So there was really not much to it, and the staff were really lovely and receiving the radiation therapy, was never painful. I wasn't radioactive and my skin didn't break down and I didn't lose hair or anything based on the radiotherapy. So I had a bit of a mild cough for a period of time and some sensation of I guess discomfort while swallowing. But that was very short-lived. And because I was expecting it, I knew that it was part of that immediate side effects from the treatment that I'd had, and it did go away just as they said it would. So that was really it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Sandra Turner, a senior radiation oncologist at the Sydney West Radiation Oncology Network at Westmead Hospital, says there are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to radiotherapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the common things we hear are that people fear radiotherapy and they worry that it's going to cause damage and side effects. They don't understand how safe and sophisticated it is. Often people think that you are going to be radioactive when you have treatment and that could be damaging to people's families or children or pregnant people. And although there are some much less common forms of radiation therapy that use radioactivity, the vast majority of people having radiotherapy are never radioactive. And the other thing is that people get very confused between chemotherapy and radiotherapy. So they don't understand that radiation is very focused, only treats the area that we need to treat with a very narrow safety margin. And so a lot of those generalized side effects like nausea and vomiting and other things that you can get from chemotherapy are much less common with radiotherapy, depending on that part of the body that we are treating.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Turner said that despite being a long-standing cancer treatment, 1 in 5 Australians who need radiotherapy never receive it. Research shows that people can be referred late which can reduce the treatment's effectiveness. There are also few to no radiotherapy machines in some parts of regional and rural Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know that sometimes lives can be lost because people don't get radiotherapy when they should. So we feel very much that every health professional, but particularly every doctor, needs to know at least the basics about what radiotherapy can do, how safe it is, how sophisticated it is, and what the process is of delivery so they can help advise and refer their patients like they need to on a whole lot of medical issues.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe explained that the technology has improved immensely over the last few decades and now contributes to at least 40 per cent of cancer cures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere used to be some places in the body that we couldn't easily use radiotherapy because of the sensitive structures or organs next to that area. And we are now able with our new technologies to be able to get around those problems. And mainly this has come about through being able to accurately visualize the organ or part of the body that's being treated at the time it's being treated. We can even follow where the cancer is within the target area that we are treating. For instance, in organs like say the lung, which moves a lot as people breathe when we're delivering the treatment, we can now make sure that we compensate for movement so that we can accurately track, for instance, the cancer in the lung so that we can be sure we're treating it every second that the machine is turned on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOne type of cancer where radiotherapy is particularly effective is prostate cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nKuldeep Duhan was diagnosed with the illness two years ago, he decided to go with radiotherapy treatment after hearing his options from oncologists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was an easy decision for me to do it because if I went for the surgery I would've had to take a month off. And from a work point of view, it won't suit me. When you are getting the radiotherapy done, you don't feel anything and everything was really seamless from my point of view. Basically I continued to work because I'll get it done in the morning and then come to work and I'll do my normal days work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 63-year-old goes for regular check-ups and is grateful to his care team for the support he receives, while Ms Mapleson has reached two years of complete clinical remission.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jared Martin, a clinical and research radiation oncologist, said radiation therapy is an effective cancer treatment, but that it's often best used in combination with chemotherapy and surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of what we've learned from clinical trials has often been for some quite complex cancers which that just one treatment alone is unlikely to get the best outcome. Quite often you do need to get some combination of both or even all three of those modalities in a very particular kind of sequence and even overlapping sometimes to get the best chance of controlling the disease. And then on top of that, we obviously also try to prioritize quality of life because the side effects both from the tumour as well as the treatment are a huge factor. And when we have shared decision making with patients, we really do try to be very collaborative, I guess, on trying to figure out priorities, because for instance, I treat a lot of prostate cancer and it might be for a particular couple, sexual function might be a huge priority and that might be very important in helping guide treatment decisions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Martin said while research into radiotherapy has been revolutionary, there has been poor messaging around its benefits, which extend beyond cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is kind of a bit mind-blowing, but it actually turns out that very low dose radiotherapy may be of some benefit for people with some chronic inflammatory conditions like plantar fasciitis, for instance, which is a condition that can affect people's ability to walk. So in radiation oncology, we're now working hard to get good high quality data about exactly how much we can maybe help people with these other conditions as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Turner is also the co-chair of World Radiotherapy Awareness Day, being launched on the 7 th of September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWorld Radiotherapy Awareness Day is a way to bring the whole radiation oncology community together, and also people that have been touched by cancer and had radiation therapy, patients and survivors, and their families, and bring everyone together to raise their voice around the same issues that are worldwide. And these are about lack of awareness, lack of education, fear of radiotherapy, and access to radiotherapy, because we haven't talked about this, but in many places in the world, there aren't even any radiation machines. And ultimately, what we'd like to do is to use that joint power and amplification of that voice to impact decision makers, policy makers, and governments to understand the importance of radiation therapy and to appropriately invest in radiotherapy services that are needed to make sure that all patients get good access to radiotherapy.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

But everyone else who had applied who met the criteria was able to progress,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMauwa said the level of racism and discrimination she experienced from colleagues drove her out of working in nursing full-time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of the critical sectors that face a labour shortage, the federal government has been prioritising visas for nurses in the skilled migration system.\n\n\n\n\n\nMauwa said that in the two decades she's lived and worked in Australia, she has seen the workforce become more diverse, but barriers still exist.\n\n\n\nTwo-thirds of nurses and midwives from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in NSW have experienced racism at work, according to a new report by the NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 3,000 nursing union members were surveyed for the report. 64 per cent said they had experienced direct racism from staff or patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report calls on employers to ensure all staff complete bystander action education. Other recommendations include prioritising the elimination of institutional racism; policies and training on incident reporting; and monitoring the effectiveness of co-designed anti-racism training.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn anti-racism roundtable will now be held to form policies and address systemic racism.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general secretary at NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association, Shaye Candish, says the union has launched a partnership to ensure progress is made.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Call for action after report details racism faced by nurses, midwives SBS News 04:30 English\n\n\"It will be chaired by the Human Rights Commission, and we will have participants from governments, from employers, from the union, from the advocacy groups, from all stakeholders involved in this collaborative,\" Candish said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reality, unfortunately, is that racism is a perverse problem, and it is a really layered and complex problem. It's going to take a lot of work and commitment from organisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it's also going to take a collaboration from all of our organisations, because there is no one simple solution, and there is no one organisation that can fix this on their own.\"\n\n\n\n'Racism is making people sick'\n\nRace Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said the report shows racism is a public health emergency that must be dealt with urgently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Put simply, racism is making people sick. Racism is stopping people who are sick from getting better, and racism is making people who are sick get worse,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSivaraman says he launched a National Anti-Racism Framework last year, but hasn't seen governments put it into action.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said that the nurses' union's report \"shows that the recommendations, and our framework, which align completely with the recommendations and their report, need to be implemented\".\n\n\n\nRace Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman says racism is a public health emergency. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas NSW Health Minister Ryan Park says there are robust anti-racism policies in place, but individuals need to work together to ensure they are implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When people don't feel safe, they don't feel culturally safe, within our settings, then the health outcomes are also worse,\" Park said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Racism is not just offensive, it can have serious detrimental impacts on people's health and wellbeing \u2014 both in terms of our staff, but also just as importantly our patients.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Mauwa, an important step is eliminating the barriers she says are stopping culturally and linguistically diverse workers from moving up in their careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the health system is happy if we (are) just working on the floor, but not wanting to progress into management or senior roles.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 85 years, one of Australia's oldest literary journals, Meanjin, will cease publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nFounded in 1940 in Brisbane, the journal is the country's second oldest literary journal after the Southerly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe journal's name comes from the local Indigenous Yuggera language - and refers to the site where central Brisbane sits.\n\n\n\n\n\nFounding editor Clem Christesen said at the time, the name honours the importance of place in the development of culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1945, the journal's operations moved to Melbourne, after an invitation by the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then in 2008, Meanjin became an editorially independent imprint of Melbourne University Publishing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Melbourne University Publishing says the Board decided financial constraints mean the final issue will be released in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement goes on to say that the two part-time staff of Meanjin were not involved in the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to close Meanjin has been widely criticised by many, including award-winning writers and prominent literary figures, including Louise Adler and author Sophie Cunningham.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of Friday (5 Sept), more than 700 people have signed an open letter to the vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Emma Johnston, to sacrifice 10 per cent of her salary to save the literary magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted Professor Johnston - and has not yet received a response.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jeanine Leane is a Wiradjuri writer, poet and academic, currently based in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor two-and-a half years, she was working as a poetry editor with Meanjin.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she has seen a vast number of diverse voices, in terms of poetry during her time at Meanjin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I found like I really had a free reign there to be adventurous, to cast out, and to make sure to cast my eye very, very broadly across and to publish a really diverse culturally linguistically, socially and politically diverse range of palettes in that space.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Leane talks about the shift that happened in 1977 for First Nations communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That first issue in 1977 did really evidence a shift, a cultural shift in the nation. And (Jim) Davidson put together this anthology in 1977, First Nations writing today, which was a collection from which the time was one of the early journals to showcase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices nationally.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says its been an important space in historically and culturally for First Nations cultural expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Meanjin has had that very strong commitment to First Nations writings, cultural and sociopolitical expression ever since that time. And arts and culture. Esther (Anatolitis) was a great arts and culture advocate, and when she became the 12th editor of Meanjin in late 2022, she established a literary and cultural advisory board.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jeanine Leane says the cultural advisory board was filled with Indigenous and culturally diverse writers and thinkers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt centered on increasing First Nations writing and publication, as well as honouring elders and recognising the work that has been done historically, particularly in the early days of the publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jeanine Leane says the decision to close Meanjin will have serious and severe consequences for Australian writers and their audiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is cultural pillage. A real - it is a type, if you like - I deliberately use that word editing and national consciousness in a way. It's a way of enforcing, I suppose, shutting down a whole lot of voices. So in many ways it's a form of censorship. Shutting down an avenue for a lot of voices is a form of censorship.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the absence of the journal will also remove an important forum and community to develop and nurture Australian storytellers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And it's one less space; one more space taken away from us as a minority, but a minority but very prolific and very articulate community. It was one more safe space that we had that is now being taken away from us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCarody Culver who's the editor of the literary Journal, Griffith Review, says the contribution of the journal has been seminal in the development of Australia's literary scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really devastating news. Griffith Review - we've had a long standing allyship with Meanjin Esther Anatolitis, the current editor, and what a wonderful advocate she is for arts and culture in Australia. And Meanjin, it's one of the country's most pre-eminent literary journals. It's the second oldest - was established in 1940, and over the last eight and a bit decades, it's published incredible work. I mean, the journal is responsible for giving us the phrase 'cultural cringe', which has become so embedded in the Australian lexicon. It's been an incredible platform for emerging and established writers and for First Nations writers as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the resource and benefits provided by the journal enriches the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Journals are wonderful platforms for writers at all stages of their careers. And in order to be able to run journals, having institutional support from somewhere like a university is incredibly valuable. So I know from my own experience of being editor of Griffith Review. We receive support from Griffith University as well as organisational funding from Creative Australia. And that's so vital to us. And this notion that some people have that literary journals should be expected to generate revenue - that's not what we're here for.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Culver says she remembers the inspiration Meanjin provided when she was doing her PhD about 15 to 20 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The expansiveness of the ideas that you would find in its pages and the fact that it had this incredibly rich, rich history and that it had contributed to our intellectual life, our intellectual culture over such a long period. So for the time that I was at my career at that stage, early on trying to establish a name to myself and trying to find the right career pathway for the editorial work that I wanted to do. Meanjin was quite a beacon for me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Culver says she has written a piece about the role and importance of literary journals in the upcoming 85th edition of Meanjin.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says journals are really good at navigating the unpredictability and the complexity of contemporary publishing, which caters to dedicated audiences of readers and writers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My piece in Meanjin is really just a reflection on why journals are important and why it can sometimes feel - be a bit challenging to fearlessly or constantly having to justify the reason that journals should exist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says we have many wonderful publications in Australia that are helping to platform the work of new voices and established voices - but the absence of Meanjin will be felt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Knowing, knowing what I know now that Meanjin will no longer exist after this 85th edition has come out, it's, it's really heartbreaking.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Culver says it's been really lovely to see the huge outpouring of support on social media, as well as news articles on the closure of Meanjin.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the weekend, thousands rallied across Australia in anti-immigration marches.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the rallies was a call to end what protest organisers called \"mass migration\" to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientia Professor at the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law Jane McAdam says the rhetoric at these marches focused on a key misconception- that migrants are to blame for a number of pressures impacting Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeen on banners, chanted in slogans and speeches at the rallies was the idea that high migrant numbers are responsible for rising cost of living, housing shortages and job insecurity, among other issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, there's a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out there about the links between migration, housing shortages, cost of living pressures, infrastructure, all those sorts of things. And I think that that has been exploited by certain elements of the community, particularly on the far right to suggest that migrants are taking your houses, taking your jobs, these sorts of things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Migration expert and Associate Professor of Public Policy at the University of Sydney Anna Boucher says issues like the housing crisis and rising cost of living are undoubtedly impacting many Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, she says the idea that the fix for these pressures is to curb migration is misdirected, and misses the vital role migrants play in the functioning of Australia's economy and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I mean 50 per cent of the Australian population are either migrant background or have one parent who was, so we're actually talking about most of Australia. In essence, Australia couldn't function without migration. International student migration comprise is a big component of our gross domestic product. Migrants provide necessary labor into skill shortage areas that we can't meet through domestic supply and immigration is a central component of Australia's multicultural identity.\u201d:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent ABS data shows migrants make up nearly one-third of Australia's workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's migrant population is also one of the most skilled among OECD countries, with nearly six in ten migrants holding a university degree or higher, in contrast with around four in ten native-born Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Grudnoff , Senior Economist at the Australia Institute says Australia relies on its skilled migrants to fill crucial gaps in the jobs market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So migrants tend to be younger than the average. Australian tend to be well-skilled and so they add a lot to Australia's economy. Australia's migration system in particular is very skills focused, so it tends to target migrants with skills that we have a shortage of. And so what they actually do is they enable us to continue to have access to goods and services that might otherwise be difficult to produce in Australia or would become far more expensive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrants make up a particularly large share of the workforce in key industries such as hospitality, health care, professional services, manufacturing and administrative services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to 2021-2022 ABS jobs data, 15 percent of migrants in Australia work in the area of health care and social assistance, and the 2021 census shows more than 40 per cent of registered nurses and aged and disabled carers were born overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Boucher says with Australia's population aging, it's expected the country will rely heavily on migrant health workers in future.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith no current visa category for low-skilled migrants, she says changes may need to be made to enable more skilled and low-skilled migrants to fill gaps expected to grow in this industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So yeah, it's clear that we won't meet the needs of our aging population exclusively through our domestic labor market... we will need to think quite carefully about how we bring in migrant labor whether that's forms of labor agreements as they're called, or whether there are changes to the visa structure to permit that to occur.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Grudnoff says one of the key messages voiced at the anti-immigration rallies over the weekend was a concern that mass migration numbers are to blame for the housing crisis Australia is experiencing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there are a few key issues with this concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, Australia is not experiencing the historic surge in migration protesters and rally organisers claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a slump in migration during the COVID-19 Pandemic was followed by an increase once borders re-opened, Mr Grudnoff says since 2024, population growth appears to have fallen back to pre-Covid rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the idea that the population is growing at a faster rate than housing is also not supported by the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over the last 10 years, the population has grown by 16%. So in order to just house that extra 16% of people, we'd need to increase the number of homes by 16%. But the number of homes has increased by more than 16%, it's increased by 19%. So we're actually building, so actually the number of homes is growing faster than the population.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says lack of affordable housing Australians are experiencing is in part driven by tax laws which favor investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been a big increase in demand for housing and in particular, investors demand for housing. So what's happened is the capital gains tax discount was introduced under the Howard government that has made making money out of housing very tax effective. It's encouraged lots of people to go out and buy an investment property. These people are outbidding first home buyers effectively and increasing price of housing and stopping people from getting into the housing market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Mr Grudnoff, a lack of low-cost government housing is also contributing to the crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So one of the problems in Australia with our housing is that the government has withdrawn from the housing sector. We used to be in the sixties, seventies and eighties, the government was heavily involved in supplying public housing and now they've largely vacated that they're not building nearly as much housing. And so consequently there is a lot less of that housing available and this is adding to the affordability crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Boucher says as with other concerns over pressures like cost of living, it's clear blame for the housing crisis is falling in the wrong place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't mean that there might not be an issue with housing, but that needs to be addressed separately. And I think that's maybe the answer is more densification. Maybe it is a speeding up the rate of construction. Maybe it is different methods of urban planning. We have a very low density city for its population size in Sydney, for instance, if you compare it with comparable cities overseas. But that's a product of our poor planning, not of migrants.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor McAdam says while concerns people have about housing, cost of living and infrastructure can't be ignored, migration should be considered an important part of the solution, rather than the problem.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Some members of the Australian-Indian community have urged Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price to apologise, after she claimed the government prioritises Indian migrants because many of them vote for Labor.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Price told ABC Radio Labor is accepting migrants who \"support their policies, their views and vote for them as well\", singling out \"the Indian community\" as an example.\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after, she appeared to walk back her comments, saying she didn't think she had anything to apologise for and appeared to accuse the interviewer of pushing the topic.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the western Sydney suburb of Harris Park \u2014 also known as Little India \u2014 some locals told SBS News the remarks have left them feeling unfairly targeted, coming just days after anti-immigration rallies that took place across the country.\n\n\n\n'It's not a thing'\n\nRitwik Singh, whose father migrated to Australia on a skilled visa, said the rallies have already unsettled many in the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was probably just a bit of a guise for some deeper stuff, like white supremacy,\" he told SBS News. \"A lot of people on my WhatsApp were saying that Indians were being called out and targeted in particular with this protest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSingh said friends overseas had reached out to check if he was safe. \"The reaction has not been positive. I had a friend from India reach out to me, saying, 'Are you guys alright?'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSingh rejected Price's claim that Indians overwhelmingly vote Labor. \"I don't agree with her. She's way off with her comments,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Indian people tend to vote by looking at their backyard. They're looking at what's most important for them \u2026 They don't necessarily side each way, but both parties definitely try and get the vote because the size of the population is pretty meaningful.\"\n\n\n\nHarris Park resident Ritwik Singh said Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price was \"way off\" with comments that claimed the government prioritises Indian migrants because many of them vote for Labor. Source: SBS News\n\n'National asset'\n\nAnother Harris Park resident, Nashih Fatima, who migrated from India seven years ago, also dismissed Price's claims about voting patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone has different political parties and different views,\" she told SBS News. \"That's silly. It's not a thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We left our country because we wanted to make this country good and better. Every immigrant has the right to live and work and be happy here.\"\n\n\n\nShail Wadhwa, president of the Council of Indian Australians Inc, said Price's remarks fuel division.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We strongly reject any narrative that unfairly targets the Indian Australian community or misrepresents their contribution to Australian society,\" Wadhwa told SBS News. \"She should be apologising to the community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWadhwa pointed to a 2022 federal government report describing the Indian diaspora as a \"national asset\", highlighting its youth, high levels of education, and above-average earnings. People born in India now make up the second-largest overseas-born population in Australia, behind those from England.\n\n\n\n'Should have been voting Coalition'\n\nPrice cited polling from political research company RedBridge, showing around 85 per cent of Indian-Australians voted Labor in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut RedBridge director Kos Samaras said the numbers don't tell the full story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These communities should have been voting Coalition,\" Samaras said, noting that the Howard government had been responsible for introducing skilled migration pathways regularly used by Indian migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On paper, they should be voting conservative \u2026 but when we ask them why they don't, the answer is blunt: the Coalition does not like them,\" Samaras said.\n\n\n\nDamage to the 'Liberal brand'\n\nAustralian National University academic Frank Bongiorno, who specialises in political history, said Price's remarks were \"very damaging to the Liberal brand\" at a time when the party was already struggling for votes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the indications are that it's electoral poison,\" he told the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Liberals distance themselves from Price's Indian migrant remark as backlash grows\n\nBongiorno said the comments were likely to have a lasting impact on how migrant communities viewed the Coalition. \"Those impressions stick and they can actually stick for years,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many [migrants] do have quite conservative cultural values that probably are more in keeping with ideas that you find within the Liberal and the National Party but ... there's a sense this is a place that's hostile to them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Singh believes anti-immigration sentiment is not widespread, he too warned it could have lasting consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will become one of those reasons where people will stop wanting to send their kids [to Australia] for education, or you might have skilled migrants think that maybe Australia's not the best choice anymore,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLiberal MP side-steps calls for apology\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley was quick to stress the Coalition's support for Indian Australians, and said Australia's migration policy remained non-discriminatory.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal MP Leon Rebello, whose parents hail from the western Indian state of Goa, told SBS News he believes Price has \"walked back\" her comments and that the party must continue to support the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Indian community does so much and they've contributed so much to Australian society \u2014 I'm there with Jacinta in the party room, backing them every step of the way,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"It's very disappointing that the marches were hijacked by neo-Nazis \u2026 However, the marches also had thousands of Australians from different backgrounds who wanted to communicate a very clear message \u2026 their concerns about the current migration problem,\" Rebello said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stopped short of calling Price to apologise to the community, saying: \"The fact that she has recognised or walked back those comments is an indication of her view.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for locals in Harris Park, the damage is already done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Immigrants are always the first port of call \u2014 it's very easy to just point the finger,\" Singh said. \"This country has been built on immigrants \u2026 they tend to do a lot more good for the country than not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Rayane Tamer and the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

Not just me; the whole village.\"\n\n\n\nUnregulated mining thrives in war\n\nEight successive rounds of testing have now confirmed dangerously high levels of arsenic in the Kok River.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first, it was widely blamed on mineral waste from gold mining, a long-known cause of arsenic contamination in nearby waterways.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was until researchers at the Shan Human Rights Foundation (SHRF) discovered two rare earth mining sites over the border in Myanmar's southern Shan State, where the Kok River originates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also compared them with the rare earth mining in Kachin [a state in northern Myanmar], and the layout of the leeching pools are the same,\" an SHRF spokesperson, Sai Hark Jet, says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, we said that this is not just ordinary mineral extraction or mining; this must be tied up with rare earth mining in Kachin State.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the rare earth mining sites in Myanmar's Shan State in satellite images seen by the Shan Human Rights Foundation. Credit: Shan Human Rights Foundation The two sites are located just 2 and 3km from the river's banks in territory controlled by the United Wa State Army, which is widely considered the most powerful militia in Shan State.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group did not respond to SBS News' requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Local people in Shan State have limited access to the areas around the mining sites, but we believe there is a huge impact, not just for the environment, but also for the community living beside the river,\" Jet says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also have heard from local people that all the water is very brown and they cannot use it anymore, but they have to because they have no other water source. But the community in Shan State dare not speak up, because of the local authority.\"\n\n\n\nRare earth mining uses chemicals to separate the valuable minerals from their ore. The process leaves behind highly contaminated liquids that often find their way back into waterways if care is not taken to contain them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThai authorities say they are working on plans to urgently install sediment traps in the Kok River to stop the arsenic from flowing downstream.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut local leaders in Tha Ton fear that sediment traps alone will not solve this crisis. They want to see Bangkok engage directly with Myanmar's military leaders in the capital Naypyidaw to end all unregulated mining across the border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we just try to solve the problem by reviving the river without closing the mines, we cannot solve the issue,\" local monk Phra Mahanikom tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If it cannot be fixed, then the community will change. Our way of life will change.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's behind the surge in rare earth mining?\n\nMany of the rare earth mines identified by SHRF are close to Myanmar's border with China, which imported a record high of nearly 42,000 tonnes of rare earths from the country in 2023, according to Global Witness, an NGO that reports environmental and human rights abuses.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeijing's dominance over the valuable minerals is well-documented; China controls roughly 70 per cent of rare earth mining operations globally, and accounts for 90 per cent of processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd global demand for the 17 chemical elements that comprise 'rare earths' is growing. Once processed, they can be used in a wide range of modern technologies, including smartphones, weapons systems and rechargeable batteries.\n\n\n\nEnvironmentalist Pianporn Deetes says Myanmar's internal conflict means rare earth mining is largely unregulated. Credit: SBS News / Claudia Farhart Thai activists believe Chinese investors are largely behind the surge in mining in Shan State and, by extension, the contamination coming from it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've learned in Kachin State there are 300 rare earth mines, legal and illegal, with Chinese-speaking investors,\" says Pianporn Deetes, the Southeast Asia campaign director at global not-for-profit International Rivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On our river headwaters, there are just a few. But there will be more and more coming if there is no action from governments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChina's embassy in Bangkok responded to accusations in June, writing on Facebook: \"China has instructed Chinese companies operating abroad to comply with the laws of the country and operate legally at all times.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut environmentalists argue that the mining sites identified are beyond the state's control, making it impossible to enforce environmental regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's happening in an area where there are no laws or even rules on safety standards. They are exploiting the situation in Myanmar,\" Deetes says.\n\n\n\nThe costs are being paid by our rivers, our forests, our lands, and our futures.\n\nTesting shows the contamination has already spread beyond the Kok River. After it passes through Tha Ton, the river empties into the Mekong \u2014 Southeast Asia's most important waterway \u2014 where abnormally high levels of arsenic have now been detected.\n\n\n\nEnvironmentalists warn a regional crisis is coming\n\nSo far, Thai authorities have taken water samples from three locations spanning a roughly 20km stretch of the Mekong River.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll have shown arsenic levels exceeding the safe limit.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News In the small village of Ban Sob Kok, about 15km downstream from the border with Myanmar, fishermen are now finding deformed fish in their daily catch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were some fish with scars. We saw them, so we didn't eat them,\" local fisherman Somdet Thanatulayakul says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But they took them for testing, and when they came back, they had the arsenic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Buyers are now afraid to eat the fish because of the news. Before, I could earn more than 1000 baht [$48] per day, but now, we can't even get 300 baht [$14] in a week.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe arsenic levels detected in the Mekong are currently far lower than those found in three of its tributaries (smaller streams that flow from a larger river), which originate in Shan State: the Kok, Sai and Ruak rivers.\n\n\n\nBut scientists believe the full impact is yet to be revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate professor at Thailand's Naresuan University, Tanapon Phenrat, explains: \"Pollutants take time to transport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we say arsenic, lead, they are in particulate format \u2014 small sediments that form in the river. These things do not transport as fast as water,\" Phenrat says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But if upstream mining keeps discharging this in the same fashion, it will form more particulates, more sediment and will transport, wave by wave, there will be more impact for sure. This is not at a steady state yet.\"\n\n\n\nThai fishermen are reporting finding deformed fish in the Mekong River and its tributaries. Credit: Supplied Thailand, Laos and Myanmar all meet on the Mekong River. It then continues downstream into Cambodia and Vietnam, supporting 60 million people through fisheries, agriculture and drinking water before emptying into the South China Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is how far environmentalists are warning the contamination could spread if it is not contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the largest environmental crime I have ever experienced,\" International Rivers' Pianporn Deetes says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can do rare earth mining in an accountable manner. But this is open mining.\n\n\n\nThey are just allowing everything to spill into the waterways. It is unacceptable.\n\nStudies have shown long-term exposure to high levels of arsenic is linked to increased rates of cancer and skin disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization says in utero and early childhood exposure has also been associated with negative impacts on cognitive development and premature death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is long-term violence,\" Deetes says.\n\n\n\nThe Mekong River supports 60 million people as it makes its way through Southeast Asia. Credit: SBS News / Claudia Farhart \"The result might not be seen within a year or two, but it might show itself in the next three, five or 10 years in newborn babies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Public health is the biggest issue for us. We don't want our future generations to be sick. So I think it is important for the government to recognise the level of the crisis as it is, and fix the problem immediately.\"\n\n\n\nMounting evidence of illegal mining\n\nThe Thai government denies it is ignoring the issue, and says it is engaging with Myanmar's military government to find a solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts own mapping also points to a recent surge in mining activity. Bangkok's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency has now detected 60 disturbed earth sites across Shan State with suspected links to mining, 21 of which it says are newly active this year.\n\n\n\nIt doesn't distinguish between regular mines and rare earth mines, but mapping conducted by the SHRF has detected a total of 47 rare earth mining sites across Shan State.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamples taken from the Kok River by Naresuan University in a study commissioned by the Thai government, led by Phenrat, have only added to the weight of evidence that rare earth mining is behind the contamination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We took water, soil, sediment and some edible plants together with fish from five stations in Chiang Rai [Thailand's northernmost province],\" Phenrat says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We quantified around 15 types of elements or ions in water samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then we compared the 'fingerprints of chemicals' \u2014 which is the ratio of different elements \u2014 with water samples we got from rare earth mining in Kachin State in Myanmar. The concentration in Thailand is lower, but the ratio of chemicals is similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This should lead to the conclusion, or at least the identification, that the contamination has to do mostly with rare earth mining.\"\n\n\n\nPhra Mahanikom was born and raised on the Kok River. He says the water is their way of life. Credit: SBS News / Claudia Farhart\n\nWay of life under threat\n\nPhra Mahanikom was born and raised in Tha Ton. After moving away to study, he returned to preside over Wat Tha Ton; a temple perched on a hilltop that overlooks the village and its river.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I bathed in the Kok River on the day I was born,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I heard the news, I went onto the bridge and I looked out onto the river. It was muddy, very muddy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That day, I felt like my mother was in the ICU and I was behind the glass doors. I couldn't speak to her, I couldn't touch her, I couldn't give her support \u2013 even one bit. That's how I felt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat, Mahanikom says, is the reality of his community's connection to the river.\n\n\n\nLa Boonruang has lived in this house by the Kok River for more than 50 years. Credit: SBS News / Claudia Farhart Tha Ton is a village of less than 20,000 people. Almost all of them rely on the river in some way for their survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They grow vegetables and they need the Kok River to water them. Now, we don't know for sure if these vegetables can be eaten,\" he says.\n\n\n\nSome people say they can, but if you can avoid it, you should avoid it. And what if they sell the vegetables and something bad happens afterwards? These are their worries.\n\nRight now, during the wet season, there is enough water running off the region's mountains to keep their crops watered. But soon, the village will once again need to rely on water from the river.\n\n\n\n\n\nLa Boonruang has lived in the same house right beside the Kok River for more than 50 years. He says farming and fishing are all he has ever known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, I feel like I cannot breathe properly, because when I wake up, I see this and I don't know what else will come,\" he says, pointing to the river.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Before, if we didn't have enough water, we could just go get it from the river and carry it to our farms. But now, it is very dangerous.\n\n\n\n",
