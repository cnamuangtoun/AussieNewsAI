    "text": "A new round of trade negotiations between the United States and China will continue into tomorrow in London, with both sides trying to preserve a fragile truce brokered last month.\n\nThe fresh talks were announced last week after a long-anticipated phone call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which appeared to ease tensions that erupted over the past month following a surprise agreement in Geneva.\n\nThe talks began yesterday and tomorrow will mark the second day, a source told CNN.\n\nREAD MORE: About 700 Marines being mobilised in response to LA protests\n\nA new round of trade negotiations between the United States and China will continue into Tuesday in London, with both sides trying to preserve a fragile truce brokered last month. (CNN)\n\nLast month, the two sides agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90-day period. The mood was upbeat.\n\nHowever, sentiment soured quickly over two major sticking points: China's control over so-called rare earth minerals and its access to semiconductor technology originating from the US.\n\nBeijing's exports of rare earths and their related magnets are expected to take centre stage at the London talks.\n\nExperts say Beijing is unlikely to give up its strategic grip over the essential minerals, which are needed in a wide range of electronics, vehicles and defence systems.\n\n\"China's control over rare earth supply has become a calibrated yet assertive tool for strategic influence,\" said Robin Xing, Morgan Stanley's chief China economist.\n\n\"Its near-monopoly of the supply chain means rare earths will remain a significant bargaining chip in trade negotiations.\"\n\nSince the talks in Geneva, Trump has accused Beijing of effectively blocking the export of rare earths, announcing additional chip curbs and threatening to revoke the US visas of Chinese students.\n\nREAD MORE: NSW Deputy Premier Prue Car diagnosed with breast cancer\n\nSince the talks in Geneva, Trump has accused Beijing of effectively blocking the export of rare earths (CNN)\n\nThe moves have provoked backlash from China, which views Washington's decisions as reneging on its trade promises.\n\nAll eyes will be on whether both sides can come to a consensus in London on issues of fundamental importance.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.\n\nTrump has authorised his trade negotiating team, led by Bessent, to ease up on some key export restrictions of US goods to China that the United States had put in place for national security concerns, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly what the negotiators will put on the table, but it appears as though the Trump administration will draw the line at some critical technology that the United States maintains is crucial for its competitiveness with China, the world's second-largest economy.\n\nIn exchange for immediately easing or halting some \u2014 or perhaps a large number of \u2013 export controls, the United States wants China to release high volumes of rare earth materials. On Saturday, Beijing appeared to send conciliatory signals.\n\nA spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry, which oversees the export controls, said it had \"approved a certain number of compliant applications.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Hundreds stranded after Qantas jet forced to divert\n\nit appears as though the Trump administration will draw the line at some critical technology that the United States maintains. (AP)\n\n\"China is willing to further enhance communication and dialogue with relevant countries regarding export controls to facilitate compliant trade,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nKevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council at the White House, told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday that the US side would look to restore the flow of rare earth minerals.\n\n\"Those exports of critical minerals have been getting released at a rate that is higher than it was, but not as high as we believe we agreed to in Geneva,\" he said, adding that he is \"very comfortable\" with a trade deal being made after the talks.\n\nOn Monday morning in an interview with CNBC, Hassett said: \"This was a very significant sticking point, because China controls \u2026 something like 90 per cent of the rare earths and the magnets.\n\nAnd if they're slow rolling, sending those to us because of some licensing deal that they set up, then it could potentially disrupt production for some US companies that rely on those things.\"\n\n\"And there are enough of those, like, for example, auto companies, that President Trump took it very seriously, called President Xi and said, we got to get this stuff coming out faster. And President Xi agreed,\" he added.\n\nHassett said the Trump administration might be open to loosening restrictions on some microchips that China viewed as critical to its manufacturing sector, although the United States would maintain restrictions on \"very, very high-end Nvidia\" chips that were capable of powering artificial intelligence systems.\n\nFollowing the trade truce negotiated in Geneva, the Trump administration expected China to lift restrictions on those minerals. (AP)\n\nThe Biden administration had cut off Chinese access to most AI chips because of national security concerns, and Trump has kept those restrictions in place.\n\nA valuable card to play In April, as tit-for-tat trade tension between the two countries escalated, China imposed a new licensing regime on seven rare earth minerals and several magnets, requiring exporters to seek approvals for each shipment and submit documentation to verify the intended end use of these materials.\n\nFollowing the trade truce negotiated in Geneva, the Trump administration expected China to lift restrictions on those minerals.\n\nBut Beijing's apparent slow-walking of approvals triggered deep frustration within the White House, CNN reported last month. Rare earths are a group of 17 elements that are more abundant than gold and can be found in many countries, including the US.\n\nBut they're difficult, costly and environmentally polluting to extract and process. China controls 90 per cent of global rare earth processing.\n\nExperts say it's possible that Beijing may seek to use its leverage over rare earths to get Washington to ease its own export controls aimed at blocking China's access to advanced US semiconductors and related technologies.\n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce in China said on Friday that some Chinese suppliers of American companies had received six-month export licences.\n\nReuters, citing two sources, also reported that suppliers of major American carmakers \u2013 including General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis \u2013 were granted temporary export licences for a period of up to six months.\n\nWhile China may step up the pace of licence approvals to cool the diplomatic temperature, global access to Chinese rare earth minerals will likely remain more restricted than it was before April, according to a Friday research note by Leah Fahy, a China economist and other experts at Capital Economics, a London-based consultancy.\n\n\"Beijing had become more assertive in its use of export controls as tools to protect and cement its global position in strategic sectors, even before Trump hiked China tariffs this year,\" the note said.\n\nChina's economic woes\n\nAs China tackles a tariff war with the US head-on, it's clear that the disruptions are continuing to cause economic pain at home.\n\nTrade and price data released on Monday painted a gloomy picture for the country's export-reliant economy.\n\nIts overall overseas shipments rose by just 4.8 per cent in May, compared to the same month a year earlier, according to data released by China's General Administration of Customs.\n\nThe Biden administration had cut off Chinese access to most AI chips because of national security concerns. (AP)\n\nIt was a sharp slowdown from the 8.1 per cent recorded in April, and lower than the estimate of 5.0 per cent export growth from a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nIts exports to the US suffered a steep decline of 34.5 per cent.\n\nThe sharp monthly fall widened from a 21 per cent drop in April and came despite the trade truce announced on May 12 that brought American tariffs on Chinese goods down from 145 per cent to 30 per cent.\n\nStill, L\u00fc Daliang, a spokesperson for the customs department, talked up China's economic strength, telling the state-run media Xinhua that China's goods trade had demonstrated \"resilience in the face of external challenges\".\n\nMeanwhile, deflationary pressures continue to stalk the world's second-largest economy, according to data released separately on Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nIn May, China's Consumer Price Index (CPI), a benchmark for measuring inflation, dropped 0.1 per cent compared to the same month last year.\n\nFactory-gate deflation, measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI), worsened with a 3.3 per cent decrease in May from a year earlier.\n\nLast month's drop marks the sharpest year-on-year contraction in 22 months, according to NBS data.\n\nDong Lijuan, chief statistician at the NBS, attributed the decline in producer prices, which measures the average change in prices received by producers of goods and services, to a drop in global oil and gas prices, as well as the decrease in prices for coal and other raw materials due to low cyclical demand.",

(CNN)\n\nIn a statement, Lively's lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb called the ruling \"a total victory and a complete vindication.\"\n\n\"As we have said from day one, this '$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,\" the statement added.\n\nMotions to dismiss Baldoni's claims by Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, Leslie Sloane, were all granted. The judge also granted a motion to dismiss by the New York Times.\n\nBaldoni had sued the publication for $250 million for libel, claiming that the newspaper published an article \"rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions\" that relied on Lively's \"self-serving narrative.\"\n\nThe judge ruled that Baldoni can file an amended complaint on the allegations of tortious interference with contract, relating to Reynolds and Lively, and breach of implied covenant, relating to Lively, by June 23, if they choose to do so.\n\nREAD MORE: NSW Deputy Premier Prue Car diagnosed with breast cancer\n\nLively first filed a civil rights complaint, claiming that she was sexually harassed by Baldoni during production of the film.

(Getty)\n\nHe also wrote in his decision that the act of providing Lively's complaint to the New York Times was not sufficient to constitute defamation \"because the complaint is protected by the fair report privilege.\"\n\nAs their legal fight unfolded, Baldoni's team published a website containing texts and an alleged timeline relating to Lively's claims.\n\nThe website, a separate leaked voice note that Baldoni sent to Lively and several public statements made by Baldoni's lawyer were the subject of several court hearings in recent months.\n\n\"It Ends With Us\" starred Lively and Baldoni as an on-screen couple and featured instances of domestic violence.",

(Getty Images: Matt King)\n\nThings get mighty complicated if Australia can't hang on to second spot in the group.\n\nSocceroos win never needed to be pretty Photo shows Aziz Behich is congratulated by teammates Nobody will confuse the Socceroos' victory over Japan as anything other than the most desperate of smash-and-grab victories. But in the end, does that even matter?\n\nThe Socceroos cannot finish any lower than third or fourth, which will put them in the fourth phase of qualifying.\n\nThat means the Socceroos would be placed into a round-robin tournament in October, played at a centralised venue within the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and featuring the other third- and fourth-placed teams from across the AFC in two groups of three.\n\nThat is likely to be the UAE and Qatar from Group A; and Oman, Iraq or Palestine from Group B \u2014 although those groups are still in flux.\n\nThe two group winners from each three-team group will progress to the 2026 World Cup.\n\nIf the Socceroos finish second in that group, there is still another chance to qualify through the intercontinental play-offs, but first they'd have to beat the other second-placed finisher from the other group in another two-legged match.\n\nThen they'd need to finish in the top two of a six-team inter-confederation play-off tournament in the USA.\n\nWhat happened last time these two teams met?\n\nThe Saudis were furious after having a late goal chalked off for offside. (Getty Images: Graham Denholm)\n\nLast time around the Socceroos drew 0-0 with Saudi Arabia in Melbourne all the way back in November.\n\nIncredibly, the Saudis had a last-gasp winner (correctly) ruled out for a narrow offside decision.\n\nWhen is kick-off?\n\nSaudi Arabia vs the Socceroos kicks off at 4:15am (AEST) on Wednesday morning in New South Wales, Queensland, the ACT, Victoria and Tasmania.\n\nThat's 2:15am in Western Australia and 3:45am in South Australia and the Northern Territory.\n\nHow can I watch the Socceroos match?\n\nThis game is exclusive to Paramount+.\n\nHowever, you can follow all the action as it unfolds in the ABC Sport live blog.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

    "text": "The one thing Aaron Cadman didn't realise he would need in abundance when he arrived at GWS was patience.\n\nAt 17, he was a winger drafted in the prized number one spot to become a key forward, and by his own admission, \"weighed nothing\" and \"was just skin and bone running on the wing\".\n\n\"There's always a couple of man-childs getting around who dominate early \u2026 Obviously, I've got a bit of a thinner frame. I had to spend years in an elite environment for my body to develop the way that it needs to,\" Cadman told ABC Sport.\n\n\"Then there's also the craft stuff that's different to say a midfielder or small forward \u2026 It's much harder to shift someone who's 110 kilos than 70 kilos.\"\n\nAll that made one of the toughest components for him coming into the system his own impatience.\n\n\"I didn't want to wait for anything,\" Cadman said.\n\n\"And then also the pressure with being number one. You want to play straight away and showcase what you got and show people why you've been drafted at number one. So, it was really tough.\"\n\n'I should be dominating now'\n\nNow 21 and in his third year, Cadman feels that a good game for him might not be kicking multiple goals but rather bringing the ball to ground enough to get others involved.\n\nThis year, he has already had more goal assists than last season and he is on track to beat his goal tally.\n\nAaron Cadman said a good game in his first two years was just bringing the ball to ground for others to get involved. (Getty: Michael Willson/AFL Photos)\n\n\"I've slowly reined in my emotions and really developed in that area, developed a lot of patience,\" he said.\n\nBut there are still days he thinks, \"I should be dominating now\".\n\nIn these moments \u2014 and wanting to be a premier goal scorer of the competition \u2014 he thinks of the likes of Carlton's Charlie Curnow.\n\nAaron Cadman has started to take more marks in his third year. (Getty: Darrian Traynor)\n\nCurnow debuted in 2016 after being taken by Carlton at pick 12. Six years later he became a two-time Coleman medallist and All-Australian (2022, 2023) after an injury-riddled start to his career.\n\nSimilarly, former Geelong star Tom Hawkins debuted in 2007 yet didn't start his five-time All Australian run until 2012. He is now ranked 13th highest in the history of the league for goalkicking.\n\nAmong some Cats fans, there was an impatience for him to develop quicker in his early years.\n\n\"Sometimes it takes you six years. So, it takes time \u2014 but I hate waiting,\" Cadman said.\n\n\"I guess it is a good mindset to have, in a way, but sometimes it does kill me\"\n\n'Not a one-man show'\n\nCadman has also been afforded time to develop in Sydney away from the limelight and in a side that is not dwelling down the bottom of the ladder.\n\nWhile number one draft picks often find themselves in struggling or rebuilding sides \u2014 such as Harley Reid at West Coast, Jason Horne-Francis while at North Melbourne and Sam Lalor at Richmond \u2014 the Giants made a preliminary final in 2023, the year Cadman debuted.\n\nHarley Reid has had a lot of external pressure as the number one pick at the Eagles. (Getty: Paul Kane)\n\n\"People think that just because they come in, they can swing everything around, but it's not a one-man show,\" Cadman said.\n\n\"I feel for those guys and the pressure that's put on them. They seem to be dealing with it. Everyone deals with it in different ways but they seem to be striving and playing some really good footy.\n\n\"But you can't expect someone in their first \u2014 you could almost say first three years \u2014 to be the best player on the team. It takes a lot of time.\n\n\"There's always going to be outliers with [Nick] Daicos and [Harry] Sheezel. They're unbelievable players. But people need to develop an elite environment and just have time in the system and to educate and hone in their skills.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nCadman is also in a forward line with the reigning Coleman medalist Jesse Hogan and 2023 All Australian captain Toby Greene, which helps things.\n\n\"Even if I compare me and [Nate Caddy] a little bit \u2026 but you can't even really compare us because he's basically been handed the reins to the whole forward line himself,\" Cadman said of the 19-year-old Bomber who coach Brad Scott hailed as a \"point of difference\" for the club after just three games.\n\n\"He's getting basically the number one defender every week, and sometimes he's got limited help. So he's flying for balls with three other people on him. He's doing it tough, but hats off to him, and he's going to be a superstar.\"\n\nGWS star completely deaf in one ear Photo shows Tom Green looks on during a GWS game Tom Green's teammates will tell you he's a hard player to get off the field. His excuse? He's completely deaf in one ear.\n\nCadman added that for key forwards, it's not always about what happens on the stat sheet, where a good game for him in his first two years was just bringing the ball to the front.\n\n\"That's all it was. [And] it's all these things, all these patterns that key forwards will run that set others up. It's the same with every other position,\" he said.\n\n\"And first-year players, I think there's way too much pressure being put on them \u2026 I'm just super grateful that I'm here in Sydney, where a bit of the limelight is off and just allows me to focus on what I need to focus on.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

(ABC News: Chris Gillette)\n\nProfessor Kapur said the RACP's advanced paediatric training was the only college pathway that mandated time in a regional area.\n\nHe said the college would accredit any funded training positions in regional hospitals but a decision to employ a full-time consultant specialist was entirely up to each individual public hospital service.\n\nThe Australian Medical Association Queensland (AMAQ) branch has also called for more state government investment in attraction and retention incentives.\n\nNick Yim says Queensland needs to offer more incentives to attract and keep specialists. (Supplied: AMA Queensland)\n\nAMAQ president Nick Yim said a workforce plan was needed to identify which regions had specialist shortages, and where the health system was losing professionals.\n\n\"We know that burnout unfortunately leads to doctors leaving the profession, so we do need to ensure they have sustainable workloads,\" Dr Yim said.\n\nProfessor Kapur said paediatricians \"have let ourselves down in not strongly advocating for more support as well\".\n\n\"Probably the government doesn't see this as a priority because outpatient-based, subspecialty medicine-based medicine doesn't grab attention,\" he said.\n\n\" Whereas oncology services, surgical waiting times, ED ramping \u2014 they are always grabbing [media] attention. \"\n\nSome Far North Queensland communities are 1,000 kilometres from Cairns Hospital. (ABC News: Brendan Mounter)\n\nAttracting workers\n\nProfessor Kapur said two new consultant paediatric cardiology positions had been created in Townsville in recent months.\n\nIn February, the Queensland government scrapped the Workforce Attraction Incentive Scheme, which offered health workers up to $70,000 to take critical roles in regional areas.\n\nIn a statement, a spokeswoman for Health and Ambulance Minister Tim Nicholls said the government was committed to delivering 34,200 extra clinicians by 2032, labelling the former government's scheme as \"ineffective\".\n\n\"The Crisafulli government is undertaking significant local, national and international recruitment activities to attract key medical professionals to help address short, medium and long-term workforce needs across the hospital and health system,\" she said.\n\n\"Our hospital rescue plan is investing in health infrastructure across the state, including building new staff accommodation which will go a long way in attracting skilled workers to the regions that need it most.\"",

    "text": "Eye-watering blueberry prices could stay higher for longer this year due to seasonal shortages and crop damage caused by last month's torrential rain in northern New South Wales.\n\nThe family favourite has been priced as high as $9.80 per 125-gram punnet in supermarkets in the past week, equating to $78.40 per kilogram.\n\nThat compares to a low of less than $2.50 for a 125-gram punnet in most capital city retailers last October and a high of $19.99 a punnet at Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia in June 2024.\n\nBerries Australia executive director Rachel Mackenzie said consumers could expect prices to ease as winter production increased in the next couple of weeks.\n\nRachel Mackenzie says berry prices will drop as supply increases. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nHowever, torrential rain in northern NSW last month could have longer-term impacts, as most of Australia's blueberries are grown in the Coffs Harbour region.\n\n\"Some growers have been completely flooded; others have had infrastructure damage and another problem is pest and disease increases after a big rain event like that,\" Ms Mackenzie said.\n\nThe Australian Horticulture Statistics handbook valued blueberry production at $505.1 million in Australia last financial year, with 27,540 tonnes produced.\n\nCoffs Harbour diversified from bananas into blueberries, tomatoes and cucumbers. (Supplied: Phillip Wilk)\n\nBlueberries are also grown in Queensland, Victoria, WA and South Australia to ensure year-round supply.\n\n\"At the moment any Australian fruit you see will probably be coming mostly from Far North Queensland, on the Atherton Tableland,\" Ms Mackenzie said.\n\nBlueberries are expensive because of flooding and seasonal variations. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nImport, export markets\n\nAustralia has traditionally imported 700\u20131,700 tonnes of fresh blueberries a year, mostly from New Zealand.\n\nMs Mackenzie said that despite Australia's higher production costs, the industry was focused on growing exports, competing with countries like Peru.\n\n\"We're hopeful that we'll be able to have access to Vietnam relatively soon,\" she said.\n\n\"China is a bit more of a long game but we are the current negotiating priority so that certainly means that we're in the mix.\"\n\nAustralian growers are looking to export blueberries. (ABC Rural: Eliza Rogers)\n\nMs Mackenzie said a recent Chinese delegation visited Australian blueberry farms looking to fill a gap in their home-grown supply, aligning with peak production in Australia.\n\n\"They actually do grow a lot of blueberries in China and interestingly, a lot of the genetics they grow are Australian genetics,\" she said.\n\n\"Despite being quite a small production country for blueberries, we're actually a real powerhouse in terms of genetics.\n\n\" We have the benefit of quality, proximity and obviously our fantastic record on food safety and sustainable practices. \"\n\nStrawberries also pricey\n\nWet weather and seasonal shortages have also impacted strawberry prices, with a 250-gram punnet retailing for $5.50 in some supermarkets.\n\nStrawberry prices will drop as Queensland's seasonal supply increases. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nQueensland Strawberry Growers Association president Adrian Schultz said the state supplied most of Australia during winter and spring.\n\nApart from some recent sunshine, farmers have battled months of rain since planting began in March, meaning lower volumes of fruit on the market.\n\nMr Schultz said a move towards hydroponic production on tabletops, using more mature plants that fruit earlier in the season, was good news for consumers.\n\nHydroponic tabletop production avoids soil-borne diseases. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nHe appealed for patience with prices until supply increased, explaining that growers had already outlaid hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past six months.\n\n\"We try and recoup all of our production costs and then later in the season is where we hope to make a profit,\" Mr Schultz said.\n\nAdrian Schultz says the strawberry supply will soon increase. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nFigures from the Australian Horticulture Statistics Handbook 2023/24 show Australian growers produced 80,741 tonnes of strawberries worth $505.5 million.\n\nMr Schultz said the industry was consolidating, with the association's membership about half what it was 20 years ago.\n\nDeep red, perfectly proportioned red rhapsody strawberries were bred in Australia. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\n\"That's basically because small family farms have gone by the wayside and the larger corporate entities have continued to expand,\" he said.\n\nWhile the number of growers may be shrinking, he said production remained steady, and strawberries were popular with consumers.\n\n\"They've got a lot of vitamins and folate, nearly as much vitamin C as a Valencia orange,\" Mr Schultz said.\n\nTasty new varieties\n\nAustralian strawberry breeding program head Jodi Neal said it took six to seven years from cross-pollination to commercial release to develop varieties suited to subtropical production in south-east Queensland and Bundaberg, temperate areas in the southern states and Stanthorpe and Perth's Mediterranean conditions.\n\nJodi Neal leads Australia's research and development of new strawberry varieties. (ABC Rural: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nShe said it took several more years for nurseries to multiply enough plants for farmers to adopt new releases, including the Stella variety.\n\nThe strawberry named in honour of the late disability activist and comedian Stella Young is being grown commercially this year.\n\nThe late Stella Young and the strawberry named in her honour. (Supplied: James Penlidis, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries)\n\n\"It's potentially a more profitable strawberry variety,\" Dr Neal said.\n\n\"It has larger fruit which means that the cost of production is a lot lower for our farmers, so they can continue making a profit.\"\n\nDr Neal said developing tasty, disease-resistant, productive varieties was satisfying.\n\nThe new white strawberry variety's skin blushes pink in the sun. (Supplied: Jodi Neal)\n\n\"Getting farmers talking to us and telling us how much that variety helped them this season \u2014 having consumers coming to us, saying, the fruit this winter is tasting fantastic, that's what drives me.\"\n\nNew white and pink strawberry varieties will become commercially available to growers next year.",

It's just all swimming,\" she said.\n\nPallister breaks 4 minutes in 400m free\n\nWith Ariarne Titmus in commentary for Channel 9 during her year's sabbatical from swimming, Lani Pallister stepped up to win the women's 400m freestyle final in a personal best time of 3:59.72 with Jamie Perkins more than three seconds behind.\n\nBoth women have qualified for the World Championships.\n\nThe final took place a day after Canadian Summer McIntosh smashed Titmus's former 400m free world record by more than a second.\n\nPallister said she was excited by McIntosh's world record.\n\n\"She's incredible. She's so young,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's silly to ever say that you doubt anyone. You know Ariarne dropped the record so many times, so I don't think I thought it was going to stay stagnant for long.\n\n\"I also think it's really incredible for women's swimming going forward and everything we've done over the past decade.\"\n\nMcIntosh was also an inspiration for the winner of the men's 400m freestyle, Sam Short, who blitzed down the pool in of 3:41.03 \u2014 his fastest time in two years.\n\n\"She's incredible, I love watching her swim,\" he said of McIntosh.\n\n\"It's contagious, I love watching greatness in any sport.\"\n\nShort finished fourth at the Paris Olympics \u2014 a performance he described as \"a failure\".\n\n\"Took me a while. I did a lot of work with sport psychology,\" he said.\n\n\"In our eyes it's a little bit of a failure, but I've got tonnes of mates back home who would literally chop their legs off just to get the opportunity to come fourth in the Olympics,\" Short said.\n\nThe man who claimed the silver medal in the 400m at Paris, Elijah Winnington, was second almost three seconds behind Short, but did enough to qualify for the World Championships.\n\nThe retirement of Emma McKeon has opened up a spot for a new madam butterfly in the Australian team.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAlexandria Perkins is the heir apparent after making the semifinals at the Paris Olympics and now she'll be going to the World Championships after winning the women's 100m butterfly in a personal best time of 56.42.\n\nShe said it was a relief to make the World Championships team.\n\n\"Definitely, I think 100 fly is always on day one and this time it was the first event, and we've still got the 50 tomorrow but it's such a relief to get the ticket booked on that flight over to Singapore,\" she said.\n\nShe said it was a strange experience racing without the presence of McKeon.\n\n\"She's been at the forefront of this event for so long and she's just so talented and she was amazing role model to look up to.\n\n\"It sucks that she's not here to race anymore, but hopefully we can bring 100 fly for Australia at the next big meets.\"",

    "text": "A shadow minister has proposed making private school fees tax-deductible, saying she hopes to start new conversations following leader Sussan Ley\u2019s pledge to stand for \u201clower, simpler, fairer taxes\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on Melbourne\u2019s 3AW radio this morning, South Australian senator Leah Blyth said the initiative would level out the playing field for parents.\n\n\u201cEven the most elite private institutions do receive a significant amount of public funding every year, and the net effect for those parents is they\u2019re contributing essentially twice because they\u2019re not only paying school fees, but they\u2019re also contributing to the public system through general taxation,\u201d she said.\n\nLeah Blyth, escorted by Senator Alex Antic (left) and leader of the opposition in the Senate Michaelia Cash (right), was sworn into the Senate in February. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\n\u201cWhat we can look at doing is evening out that playing field, but also looking at how we are funding public schools. I think it\u2019s fair to say education standards have been dropping, particularly in our public schools across our nation, for decades, and we\u2019ve got to do something to make sure that we aren\u2019t leaving any children behind, while also appreciating how different families choose to educate their children.\u201d\n\nBlyth said her proposal was before the parliamentary budget office to be costed, and she said it also involved investing money saved into public schools to narrow the gap between them and private ones.\n\nBlyth also proposed an increase in \u201cincome splitting\u201d. This involves a worker who earns more than their partner splitting off some of their income to their spouse, so that their income is lower, and they do not have to pay as much tax.\n\nBlyth entered the Senate in February and was appointed shadow assistant minister for stronger families and stronger communities in last month\u2019s shadow cabinet reshuffle.",

    "text": "And don\u2019t forget 196-centimetre interceptor Josh Gibcus, who has endured a horror injury run since an eye-catching debut season in 2022 \u2013 after being the No.9 pick \u2013 and is yet to appear this season. As a result of the departures, Richmond made seven top-30 selections in 2024, but also snared a probable top-four choice from the Kangaroos in this year\u2019s edition, for the No.27 pick last year and their 2025 second-rounder. Richmond need to improve their midfield brigade around Tim Taranto and Jacob Hopper. Credit: Getty Images Something the Tigers need are more blue-chip midfielders to complement and eventually take over from Tim Taranto, 27, and Jacob Hopper, 28. They are set to pick two of the best few teenage talents in November, even with top-liners Zeke Uwland (Gold Coast) and Daniel Annable (Brisbane Lions) tied to northern academies.\n\nLoading Richmond recruiters will be ogling potential top-five selections Dyson Sharp, Willem Duursma \u2013 brother of Xavier, Zane and Yasmin \u2013 Sam Grlj and Oliver Greeves, while ruck-forward Cooper Duff-Tytler, a No.1 pick candidate, is another option. They have onballers Josh Smillie and Taj Hotton, both selected in the top 12 last year, waiting in the wings, too, so Blair Hartley and co. have identified their list building blocks. It makes you think of ex-Tigers coach Damien Hardwick\u2019s bold statement on joining Gold Coast, where he said he believed he already had 80 per cent of the Suns\u2019 inaugural premiership side. There is less evidence at Punt Road for Yze to make such a call about Richmond, but they should be pleased with the early signs.\n\nThe Tigers know key-position players take longer to develop and come with a higher bust risk than their midfield peers, but also how crucial they are, which was why they drafted so many, so early in this process. They are hopeful the next Alex Rance and Jack Riewoldt are lurking within this crop, while Richmond are planning for life after Toby Nankervis, with Samson Ryan, Mate Colina and Oliver Hayes-Brown jostling to be his ruck successor. Tiger Tom Brown has been one of the bright spots for Adem Yze\u2019s team. Credit: Getty Images Beyond the wins, competitive defeats and first-year draftees, another positive is that some other emerging Tigers have put their hand up to suggest they could be meaningful parts of a successful future, too. Tom Brown, Seth Campbell, Sam Banks, Steely Green, James Trezise and Kane McAuliffe are chief among those \u2013 and that is as important as any other development.\n\nLoading Noah Balta, Jack Ross, Ben Miller, Rhyan Mansell and Thomson Dow headline a modest mid-20s group that needs to get stronger but offers a decent-enough plank for now between the kids and veterans. Speaking on Fox Footy, Riewoldt, like Yze, was concerned with Saturday\u2019s effort, saying too many of these types of losses can be \u201csoul-destroying\u201d. The coach himself mentioned there would be pain along the journey, yet the underlying evidence is that Richmond are ahead of schedule. Frittering away chance Melbourne were looking more like the side many expected before their latest Alice Springs horror show against St Kilda, so it was not particularly surprising that they ran Collingwood close.\n\nThe problem for Simon Goodwin\u2019s Demons is they started the season 0-5 and have a sub-90 percentage, so finals remain a longshot for a club that gave away its first-round pick this year to Essendon (a strategy that has consistently worked for them). Bayley Fritsch has kicked 207 goals in 100 games since the start of 2021, but he\u2019s had a challenging season and even at his best was criticised \u2013 including by Matthew Lloyd \u2013 for being selfish at times. The aftermath of Bayley Fritsch\u2019s ill-advised decision to play on near goal. Credit: AFL Photos Fritsch is back in form after being dropped ahead of round six, and kicked two of his three goals in the final quarter to give Melbourne a shot at upsetting the ladder-leading Pies. However, there was a brain-fade moment, with scores tied in the last term, when Fritsch marked 25 metres out, and instantly played on while not realising Isaac Quaynor was in front of him. That was bad enough without factoring in that teammate Tom Sparrow was on his own running towards the goal square.\n\nGoodwin probably takes the good with the bad from Fritsch, but it was certainly costly. What the 2021 premiership coach would be thrilled with was the Demons\u2019 disciplined team job on Collingwood superstar Nick Daicos, from Ed Langdon to Clayton Oliver and Judd McVee. Langdon did the lion\u2019s share of the lifting in a sacrificial role, but the overall willingness to stick at it was one of the most positive takeaways. Daicos finished with a modest 19 disposals, one goal and only four score involvements. Mission accomplished. All-Australian ruck race We are amid one of the most competitive races to be the starting ruckman in the All-Australian side.\n\nSelectors might need to consider picking two of seven-time All-Australian Max Gawn, Tristan Xerri and Tom De Koning, given how good they have been. Neither Xerri nor De Koning has ever made the final cut, although the Kangaroo made the extended squad last year. The last time two ruckmen made the team was in 2021, when Gawn (starting) and Nic Naitanui (bench) were selected. Xerri, De Koning and Gawn were excellent again in round 13, and offer different qualities. Tristan Xerri and Tom De Koning, pictured during their Good Friday battle, have built All-Australian ruck cases. Credit: Getty Images Xerri leads all ruckmen in clearances and hitouts-to-advantage; Gawn averages more marks, disposals and contested possessions than all his ruck peers; and the uber-athletic De Koning performs strongly in almost every relevant category. None of their teams are in the top eight, which continues an unhealthy narrative about ruckmen\u2019s worth, but that should not take away from how great each of them has been.\n\nOf note is that Xerri towelled Gawn in round two, while De Koning received coaches\u2019 votes against Xerri in round six (Xerri won the hitouts and was a tackling machine but De Koning kicked a goal and had more clearances in a big Carlton win). Gawn and De Koning are due to do battle in round 19. Jack Silvagni shut down in-form Bomber Nate Caddy to be one of Carlton\u2019s best players. Credit: AFL Photos Where do Blues fit? Carlton\u2019s unconvincing victory over Essendon on Sunday night provided little evidence that they have turned the corner and are set to challenge for a finals berth. Coach Michael Voss performed his best spin-doctor impression after their 38-point first-half lead disintegrated to only six with almost four-and-a-half minutes left, against a Bombers side missing Mason Redman, Sam Draper, Nick Bryan, Kyle Langford, Ben McKay, Zach Reid and Jordan Ridley.\n\nVoss said they addressed their constant second-half fadeouts during the bye a week earlier and that the worrying trend would not be instantly solved. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have, if you\u2019re in front by that much, and you\u2019re getting that many opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe harder one to solve is you\u2019re behind all the time, you get no opportunities, and you\u2019re trying to win your game from a completely negative base.\u201d The Blues could take heart from Jack Silvagni\u2019s job on Nate Caddy in his first game back, Zac Williams\u2019 reintegration as a forward, and tagger Alex Cincotta\u2019s effort on Zach Merrett. First-gamer Hudson O\u2019Keeffe also showed promise. Voss revealed afterwards that the 202-centimetre ruckman made significant strides as a forward in the past month to earn his shot.",

That means focussing on the items you truly use and love, then making a fun project of donating and selling the rest. By decluttering with purpose \u2014 rather than just haphazardly heaping items into a bin bag \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re not just throwing it away, you\u2019re actually passing it on to someone else who could use it better than you can\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about rightsizing your home for somewhere easier to look after, you should also consider where that next home is located \u2014 because easy access to services like health care, transport, walkable environments and community centres or programs can make all the difference as you age.\n\nFuture-proofing your home for the years to come\n\nRightsizing can be a great opportunity to ensure our homes are as accessible as possible for the decades to come. And future-proofing your home \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to be expensive, and it doesn\u2019t have to mean renovations\u201d, says O\u2019Connell.\n\nThere are many minor adjustments you can make to help you stay independent and at home for longer. These include replacing doorknobs, which due to conditions such as arthritis, may become difficult to turn as you age, with simple levers. Door hinges can be offset so you can widen the doorway for future accessibility needs if required. And adding grab rails to toilets and showers can help you move around the bathroom with confidence.\n\nBrighter lighting, especially in stairways and hallways, can increase visibility and reduce fall risk, as can adding contrasting colours on the edges of steps. You might also consider installing smart-home technology that offers features like voice-activated assistance to control lights, video doorbells and alarms.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s never too early to start on these changes.\n\n\u201cI do think starting early and making changes gradually makes it more affordable,\u201d says O\u2019Connell. \u201cAnd small changes now can equal more autonomy later.\u201d\n\nStaying socially connected through activities like walking is key to healthy ageing.\n\nBonus tips for setting yourself up for healthy ageing\n\nHere\u2019s a statistic that might surprise you: \u201cOnly around 25 per cent of age-related decline is genetic,\u201d says O\u2019Connell. \u201cSo, what that means is that we can do an awful lot to help ourselves live well now and into our later years.\u201d\n\nIn her work with LiveUp, a national platform designed to help older Australians stay well as they age, O\u2019Connell uses healthy ageing principles set out by the World Health Organization.\n\nThat includes encouraging simple but effective steps like getting physically active and eating well, staying socially connected, joining clubs, volunteering, learning new skills to keep the brain sharp, as well as getting regular health checks to catch any small issues before they become big ones.\n\nO\u2019Connell believes that both in and outside of the home, with a little forward planning, you can set yourself up to be able to do what you both need and want to be able to do in the future.\n\nReady to take the next step in reimagining your home and life?

    "text": "The Socceroos were a bit on the nose with the public. Osieck had allowed the ageing \u201cGolden Generation\u201d to hang on for too long, and his style of football was hardly inspiring. Later that year, in their wisdom, Football Federation Australia scheduled back-to-back friendlies, both away, against Brazil and France. Rare chances for them to measure up against true global yardsticks.\n\nIt was 2013, and Australia had just sealed a spot at the World Cup in Brazil. Josh Kennedy was the saviour, thanks to his iconic late header against Iraq in front of 80,000 people in Sydney. But there was no saving the unpopular Holger Osieck, who was sacked three months later, despite delivering Australia\u2019s third successive qualification.\n\nCritics accused the Socceroos of making the Australian game look like a \u201cjoke\u201d on the world stage with their \u201cspineless\u201d performances, and several players of outstaying their welcome in the team. As soon as he returned to the team hotel after game two in Paris, Osieck was dismissed, and moves were immediately afoot to get the federation\u2019s No.1 coaching target, Ange Postecoglou, out of his contract at Melbourne Victory, thus setting in train a series of events that would soon lead to Postecoglou taking over and regenerating the squad, Mark Schwarzer\u2019s retirement, and the handing over of the gloves to Ryan, who will win his 100th cap on Wednesday morning (AEST) by hopefully contributing to what would be one of the best moments of his career.\n\nFor that not to happen, the Socceroos would need to turn in a stinker the likes of which they have not had in 12 years. Not since that day in Paris. Or that other day in Bras\u00edlia. That is how bad they would have to be to miss out on the 2026 World Cup from here. That is how long ago they last lost by five goals or more.\n\nA lifetime ago: Lucas Neill and Holger Osieck in 2013. Credit: Penny Stephens\n\nThat is the sort of heist Saudi Arabia has to pull off in Jeddah.\n\nIt is an unfathomable thought on multiple levels. So far in this qualifying phase, the Saudis have scored only six goals in nine games \u2013 so to do it, they\u2019d essentially need to reproduce that whole output in one match. Only twice before have the Socceroos ever lost a competitive match (not friendlies) by 5-0 or worse, and not since 1997.",

    "text": "\u201cSo that was one of my better ones,\u201d said Mickelson, who added a birdie at No. 18 for a 6-under 65 and a 54-hole total of 13-under 200, two shots off the pace. \u201cEven I was a bit surprised.\u201d\n\nMickelson\u2019s birdie from the bunker at No. 17 with his back to the flagstick overshadowed Joaqu\u00edn Niemann outlasting a charge from a group of major champions to win the event in Gainesville, Virginia. Even as Niemann celebrated onstage, the chatter from patrons around the property remained squarely on Mickelson\u2019s wizardry.\n\nThe six-time major championship winner, who will turn 55 next week, treated a disbelieving gallery to perhaps the most improbable shot of his career - which is saying something for one of the most creative players in history - during Sunday\u2019s weather-delayed final round of LIV Golf Virginia at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club.\n\nThe moment unfolded after Mickelson landed his approach at the par-4 17th in a bunker guarding the left front of the green. Facing an uphill lie, Mickelson glanced at the target, addressed the ball for the last time with his right side pointed at the green and proceeded into his backswing gripping his sand wedge.\n\nAt contact, the ball sailed high and travelled practically behind Mickelson\u2019s head, landing within two feet of the pin and trickling into the cup, triggering a wild celebration from his legion of fans who had endured miserable conditions to track Mickelson\u2019s round to completion.\n\nPhil Mickelson during a LIV tournament. Credit: AP\n\n\u201cMan, he created some Phil magic there,\u201d said Bryson DeChambeau, playing in the threesome with Mickelson and finishing tied for fourth at 13 under. \u201cYou could just see his wheels turning, and then he hit the shot, and I got the perfect angle of it. \u2026 I go, \u2018Oh my gosh, he\u2019s going to make it,\u2019 and it went in the hole, and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s got to be one of the greatest shots I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe dazzling shot was the highlight of LIV Golf\u2019s second stop in three years in the shadow of the nation\u2019s capital, where the tour\u2019s future has been oft debated. In February, Tiger Woods joined PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan and player director Adam Scott in a White House meeting with President Donald Trump and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund that bankrolls LIV Golf, for negotiations to reunify the fractured sport.",

    "text": "From Harbour to Harbour 2 is the second incarnation of a project in which Sharifian\u2019s band, Lian, is joined by didgeridoo virtuoso William Barton and his mother, singer Aunty Delmae Barton. The concept, however, was better than the execution, as where I was sitting the bottom-end sound was sludgy, and the didgeridoo\u2019s nuances were largely lost.\n\nMohsen Sharifian\u2019s folkloric music comes from the southern Iranian coast on the Persian Gulf, and for the local Iranian community Sharifian has the star power of Elvis, Michael Jackson and Taylor Swift rolled into one. He has done what Goran Bregovic did for Balkan music: locate it within the universal dance beat of a thumping bass drum \u2013 here an electronic wallop triggered by Morteza Palizdan\u2019s foot \u2013 and take it to the world.\n\nI had a little glimpse of what it would be like to be a god. From my box in Chatswood\u2019s Concert Hall, high above the front edge of the stage, I gazed down on a seething mass of humanity in what was effectively a mosh-pit, only with seating getting the way. The excitement of these people was as explosive as the music.\n\nBarton and Aunty Delmae only topped and tailed a generous show that started 35 minutes late, while we, in a new low for concert presentation, watched ads on a big screen. The rest embodied the instant party that\u2019s a Lian performance, with people dancing from the moment the band launched into the raucous Eshkeleh, and only stopping when Sharifian addressed us.\n\nHe\u2019s a virtuoso player of the ney-anban, an Iranian bagpipe with a sound that\u2019s shriller and even more transfixing than the Celtic version. His band also contains a second ney-anban player, his daughter Liana, whose main solo incorporated a dissonance that sliced through one like shards of glass, and whose instrument was adorned with a string of pom-poms, so when she twirled while playing, these gracefully arced around her.\n\nFrom the moment the band\u2019s formidable density \u2013 having three hand-drummers, an oud player and an electric bassist \u2013 fully kicked in, you understood why such a piercing instrument is demanded. Sharifian also sings, although the primary vocalist was the impressive Aka Safavi, who also had to scale this wall of sound, and did so more as a seasoned professional than as the natural charismatic that is Sharifian. The lyrics, meanwhile, sometimes drew on Omar Khayyam\u2019s poetry.\n\nMore than anything this concert was the sound of joy: a joy that engulfed a room more used to hosting polite applause with rumps firmly glued to seats. Intermittently the mood could change to the pensive beauty of Reza Kashi\u2019s oud, but that pounding ersatz bass drum, intent on stoving in one\u2019s ribcage, was not to be denied, and soon enough we were back in a musical frenzy, with the ecstatic response it engendered. It was just a shame the sound was so muddy.",

    "text": "Whooping cough (pertussis) is always circulating in Australia, and epidemics are expected every three to four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the numbers reported during the current surge \u2014 which started in 2024 \u2014 are higher than usual epidemics.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccines for this highly infectious respiratory infection have been available in Australia for many decades. Yet it remains a challenging infection to control because immunity (due to prior infection or vaccination) wanes with time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025, more than 14,000 cases have been recorded already. Some regions, including Queensland and Western Australia's Kimberley region, are experiencing a marked rise in cases.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, more than 57,000 cases of whooping cough were reported in Australia \u2014 the highest yearly total since 1991 \u2014 including 25,900 in NSW.\n\n\n\nWhat is causing the current surge?\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to numbers higher than expected for an anticipated epidemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 reduced natural immunity to many diseases, disrupted routine childhood vaccination services, and resulted in rising distrust in vaccines. This has meant higher-than-usual numbers for many infectious diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's not only Australia witnessing this surge.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, whooping cough cases are at their highest since 1948, with deaths reported in several states, including two infants.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, vaccine coverage remains relatively high, but it is slipping and is below the national target of 95 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven small declines may have a significant impact on infection rates.\n\n\n\nWho is at risk of whooping cough?\n\nYoung babies, especially those under six weeks of age, are extremely vulnerable to whooping cough because they're too young to be vaccinated.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfants under six months of age are also more likely to require hospitalisation for breathing support or have severe outcomes such as pneumonia, seizures or brain inflammation. Some do not survive.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the greatest number of cases occurs in older children and adults. In fact, in 2024, more than 70 per cent of cases occurred in children 10 years and older, and adults.\n\n\n\nCan you get whooping cough even if you\u2019re vaccinated?\n\nThe whooping cough vaccine works well, but its protection fades with time. Babies are immunised at six weeks, four months and six months, which gives good protection against severe illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut without extra (booster) doses, that protection drops, falling to less than 50 per cent by four years of age. That's why booster doses at 18 months and four years are essential for maintaining protection against the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nA whooping cough vaccine is also recommended for any adult who wishes to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with pertussis. Carers of young infants, in particular, should have a booster dose if they've not received one in the past ten years.\n\n\n\n\n\nA booster dose is also recommended every ten years for healthcare workers and early childhood educators.\n\n\n\nThe whooping cough vaccine works well, but its protection fades with time. Source: AAP / PA/Alamy One of the best ways we can protect babies from the life-threatening illness of whooping cough is vaccination during pregnancy, which transfers protective antibodies to the unborn baby.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a woman hasn't received a vaccine during pregnancy, they can be vaccinated as soon as possible after delivery (preferably before hospital discharge). This won't pass protective immunity to the baby, but reduces the likelihood of the mother getting whooping cough, providing some indirect protection to the infant.\n\n\n\nHow contagious is whooping cough?\n\nWhooping cough is extremely contagious \u2014 in fact, it is up to ten times more contagious than the flu.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're immunised against whooping cough, you're likely to have milder symptoms. But you can still catch and spread it, including to babies who have not yet been immunised.\n\n\n\nData shows siblings (and not parents) are one of the most common sources of whooping cough infection in babies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis highlights the importance of on-time vaccination not just during pregnancy, but also in siblings and other close contacts.\n\n\n\nHow do I know it's whooping cough, and not just a cold?\n\nEarly symptoms of whooping cough can look just like a cold: a runny nose, mild fever, and a persistent cough.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter about a week, the cough often worsens, coming in long fits that may end with a sharp \"whoop\" as the person gasps for breath.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn very young babies, there may be no whoop at all. They might briefly stop breathing (called an \"apnoea\") or turn blue.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia's first case of clade 1b mpox found in man who was holidaying in Thailand\n\nIn teens and adults, the only sign may be a stubborn cough (the so-called \"100-day\" cough) that won't go away.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have whooping cough, you may be infectious for up to three weeks after symptoms begin, unless treated with antibiotics (which can shorten this to five days).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need to stay home from work, school or childcare during this time to help protect others.\n\n\n\nWhat should I do to reduce my risk?\n\nStart by checking your vaccination record. This can be done through the myGov website, the Express Plus Medicare app or by asking your GP.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're pregnant, get a whooping cough booster in your second trimester. A booster is also important if you're planning to care for young infants or meet a newborn.\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a cough that lasts more than a week or comes in fits? Ask your GP about testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne quick booster could help stop the next outbreak from reaching you or your loved ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nNiall Johnston is a conjoint associate lecturer at Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelen Quinn is a senior research fellow at National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, and a senior lecturer at Children\u2019s Hospital Westmead Clinical School, University of Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoebe Williams is a paediatrician and infectious diseases physician, and a senior lecturer and NHMRC fellow, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney.\n\n\n\n",

Source: SBS News / Pranjali Seghal After she revealed all the scrolls and called sequined performer Gabi Barton onstage to lead some stretching, the still-silent Woopsyang rang a tiny bell into a microphone to commence the competition.\n\n\n\nTackling burnout culture\n\nInformed by hardcore work culture in some Asian countries, Woopsyang has toured the Space Out competition to other cities including Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai \u2014 this is its first time in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she was surprised to learn that Australians, who seem so laid back, report high levels of burnout.\n\n\n\nPo from the Teletubbies participated, as did Dipsy. The pair didn't know each other.

Source: SBS News / Madeleine Wedesweiler Woopsyang wanted the event to represent all different ages and professions, as though she was creating a miniature city where everyone was spacing out together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ten years ago when I was working as an artist, I felt so burnt out, and so overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was interrogating myself: 'Why do I feel so much anxiety? Why can't I stop, why can't I pause?'\n\n\n\nMany participants remarked they felt very zen afterwards.

They occur in travellers returning from overseas, or are contracted locally after mixing with an infected traveller or their contacts.\n\n\n\nSource: The Conversation / WHO Measles most commonly affects children and is preventable with vaccination, given in Australia in two doses at 12 and 18 months old. But in light of current outbreaks globally, is there a case for reviewing the timing of measles vaccinations?\n\n\n\nSome measles basics\n\nMeasles is caused by a virus belonging to the genus Morbillivirus. Symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose and a rash. While it presents as a mild illness in most cases, measles can lead to severe disease requiring hospitalisation, and even death. Large outbreaks can overwhelm health systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasles can have serious health consequences, such as in the brain and the immune system, years after the infection.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE From HIV to polio and measles: WHO chief warns US aid cuts could cost millions of lives\n\nMeasles spreads from person to person via small respiratory droplets that can remain suspended in the air for two hours. It\u2019s highly contagious \u2014 one person with measles can spread the infection to 12\u201318 people who aren\u2019t immune.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause measles is so infectious, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends two-dose vaccination coverage above 95 per cent to stop the spread and achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow and declining vaccine coverage, especially since the COVID pandemic, is driving global outbreaks.\n\n\n\nWhen are children vaccinated against measles?\n\nNewborn babies are generally protected against measles thanks to maternal antibodies. Maternal antibodies get passed from the mother to the baby via the placenta and in breast milk, and provide protection against infections including measles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO advises everyone should receive two doses of measles vaccination. In places where there\u2019s a lot of measles circulating, children are generally recommended to have the first dose at around nine months old. This is because it\u2019s expected maternal antibodies would have declined significantly in most infants by that age, leaving them vulnerable to infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf maternal measles antibodies are still present, the vaccine is less likely to produce an immune response.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch has also shown a measles vaccine given at less than 8.5 months of age can result in an antibody response which declines more quickly. This might be due to interference with maternal antibodies, but researchers are still trying to understand the reasons for this.\n\n\n\nA second dose of the vaccine is usually given 6\u20139 months later. A second dose is important because about 10\u201315 per cent of children don\u2019t develop antibodies after the first vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn settings where measles transmission is under better control, a first dose is recommended at 12 months of age. Vaccination at 12 months compared with nine months is considered to generate a stronger, longer-lasting immune response.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, children are routinely given the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 months and the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV, with \u201cvaricella\u201d being chickenpox) vaccine at 18 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nBabies at higher risk of catching the disease can also be given an additional early dose. In Australia, this is recommended for infants as young as six months when there\u2019s an outbreak or if they\u2019re travelling overseas to a high-risk setting.\n\n\n\nA new study looking at measles antibodies in babies\n\nA recent review looked at measles antibody data from babies under nine months old living in low- and middle-income countries. The review combined the results from 20 studies, including more than 8,000 babies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers found that while 81 per cent of newborns had maternal antibodies to measles, only 30 per cent of babies aged four months had maternal antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study suggests maternal antibodies to measles decline much earlier than previously thought. It raises the question of whether the first dose of measles vaccine is given too late to maximise infants\u2019 protection, especially when there\u2019s a lot of measles around.\n\n\n\nShould we bring the measles vaccine forward in Australia?\n\nAll of the data in this study comes from low- and middle-income countries, and might not reflect the situation in Australia where we have much higher vaccine coverage for measles, and very few cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s coverage for two doses of the MMR vaccine at age two is above 92 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this is lower than the optimal 95 per cent, the overall risk of measles surging in Australia is relatively low.\n\n\n\nIn Australia, children are routinely given the MMR vaccine at 12 months and the MMRV vaccine at 18 months. Source: AP / Mary Conlon Nonetheless, there may be a case for broadening the age at which an early extra dose of the measles vaccine can be given to children at higher risk. In New Zealand, infants as young as four months can receive a measles vaccine before travelling to an endemic country.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the current routine immunisation schedule in Australia is unlikely to change.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding an extra dose to the schedule would be costly and logistically difficult. Lowering the age for the first dose may have some advantages in certain settings, and doesn\u2019t pose any safety concerns, but further evidence would be required to support this change. In particular, research is needed to ensure it wouldn\u2019t negatively affect the longer-term protection that vaccination offers from measles.\n\n\n\nMaking sure you\u2019re protected\n\nIn the meantime, ensuring high levels of measles vaccine coverage with two doses is a global priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople born after 1966 are recommended to have two doses of measles vaccine. This is because those born before the mid-1960s likely caught measles as children (when the vaccine was not yet available) and would therefore have natural immunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about your vaccination status, you can check this through the Australian Immunisation Register. If you don\u2019t have a documented record, ask your doctor for advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch-up vaccination is available under the National Immunisation Program.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeru Sheel is an associate professor at Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney.

Everything from natural disasters to the COVID-19 pandemic, the recession it caused. The threats we faced in the Indo-Pacific and the assertions and coercions of China - and our response to that. But through all of that, the Australian people were absolutely amazing.\"\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nA former federal politician who lost her seat at the recent election, says she wants to move into Tasmanian state parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff lost his job, when other politicians voted against his leadership - and now there will be a sudden election.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Liberal M-P Bridget Archer wants to be chosen to represent a seat in the Bass electorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to be anybody's stooge or anybody's puppet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bridget is a fighter. Bridget, understands the importance of being part of Team Tasmania.\"\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is SBS 50th birthday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national public broadcaster started in 1975 as an experiment to share information about a national health care program, to Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, SBS broadcasts in 63 languages.\n\n\n\n\n\nNITV began in 2012 - a channel made by, for and about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging Director of SBS, James Taylor, says there is a lot to celebrate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got the highest volumes of multilingual content than ever before in our history. And in 60 languages. We're also being acknowledged across a number of other fronts. We've got the Australian streaming platform through SBS On Demand, and we are the podcaster of the year, three years in a row. These are all things to really be celebrated. We're a public good, we are in part funded by the public, and it's really important for us to be delivering more and more value each year to Australians.\"\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tennis, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz has defeated Jannik Sinner in the French Open final.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is his fifth Grand Slam trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcaraz said kind words about his rival, Sinner, who had wanted to win his third major tennis trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Honestly, I know how hard you're chasing this tournament or every tournament. I'm pretty sure you're going to be champion not once but many, many times. It's a privilege to share the court with you in every tournament, making history with you.\"\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A shadow minister has proposed making private school fees tax-deductible, saying she hopes to start new conversations following leader Sussan Ley\u2019s pledge to stand for \u201clower, simpler, fairer taxes\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on Melbourne\u2019s 3AW radio this morning, South Australian senator Leah Blyth said the initiative would level out the playing field for parents.\n\n\u201cEven the most elite private institutions do receive a significant amount of public funding every year, and the net effect for those parents is they\u2019re contributing essentially twice because they\u2019re not only paying school fees, but they\u2019re also contributing to the public system through general taxation,\u201d she said.\n\nLeah Blyth, escorted by Senator Alex Antic (left) and leader of the opposition in the Senate Michaelia Cash (right), was sworn into the Senate in February. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\n\u201cWhat we can look at doing is evening out that playing field, but also looking at how we are funding public schools. I think it\u2019s fair to say education standards have been dropping, particularly in our public schools across our nation, for decades, and we\u2019ve got to do something to make sure that we aren\u2019t leaving any children behind, while also appreciating how different families choose to educate their children.\u201d\n\nBlyth said her proposal was before the parliamentary budget office to be costed, and she said it also involved investing money saved into public schools to narrow the gap between them and private ones.\n\nBlyth also proposed an increase in \u201cincome splitting\u201d. This involves a worker who earns more than their partner splitting off some of their income to their spouse, so that their income is lower, and they do not have to pay as much tax.\n\nBlyth entered the Senate in February and was appointed shadow assistant minister for stronger families and stronger communities in last month\u2019s shadow cabinet reshuffle.",

    "text": "And don\u2019t forget 196-centimetre interceptor Josh Gibcus, who has endured a horror injury run since an eye-catching debut season in 2022 \u2013 after being the No.9 pick \u2013 and is yet to appear this season. As a result of the departures, Richmond made seven top-30 selections in 2024, but also snared a probable top-four choice from the Kangaroos in this year\u2019s edition, for the No.27 pick last year and their 2025 second-rounder. Richmond need to improve their midfield brigade around Tim Taranto and Jacob Hopper. Credit: Getty Images Something the Tigers need are more blue-chip midfielders to complement and eventually take over from Tim Taranto, 27, and Jacob Hopper, 28. They are set to pick two of the best few teenage talents in November, even with top-liners Zeke Uwland (Gold Coast) and Daniel Annable (Brisbane Lions) tied to northern academies.\n\nLoading Richmond recruiters will be ogling potential top-five selections Dyson Sharp, Willem Duursma \u2013 brother of Xavier, Zane and Yasmin \u2013 Sam Grlj and Oliver Greeves, while ruck-forward Cooper Duff-Tytler, a No.1 pick candidate, is another option. They have onballers Josh Smillie and Taj Hotton, both selected in the top 12 last year, waiting in the wings, too, so Blair Hartley and co. have identified their list building blocks. It makes you think of ex-Tigers coach Damien Hardwick\u2019s bold statement on joining Gold Coast, where he said he believed he already had 80 per cent of the Suns\u2019 inaugural premiership side. There is less evidence at Punt Road for Yze to make such a call about Richmond, but they should be pleased with the early signs.\n\nThe Tigers know key-position players take longer to develop and come with a higher bust risk than their midfield peers, but also how crucial they are, which was why they drafted so many, so early in this process. They are hopeful the next Alex Rance and Jack Riewoldt are lurking within this crop, while Richmond are planning for life after Toby Nankervis, with Samson Ryan, Mate Colina and Oliver Hayes-Brown jostling to be his ruck successor. Tiger Tom Brown has been one of the bright spots for Adem Yze\u2019s team. Credit: Getty Images Beyond the wins, competitive defeats and first-year draftees, another positive is that some other emerging Tigers have put their hand up to suggest they could be meaningful parts of a successful future, too. Tom Brown, Seth Campbell, Sam Banks, Steely Green, James Trezise and Kane McAuliffe are chief among those \u2013 and that is as important as any other development.\n\nLoading Noah Balta, Jack Ross, Ben Miller, Rhyan Mansell and Thomson Dow headline a modest mid-20s group that needs to get stronger but offers a decent-enough plank for now between the kids and veterans. Speaking on Fox Footy, Riewoldt, like Yze, was concerned with Saturday\u2019s effort, saying too many of these types of losses can be \u201csoul-destroying\u201d. The coach himself mentioned there would be pain along the journey, yet the underlying evidence is that Richmond are ahead of schedule. Frittering away chance Melbourne were looking more like the side many expected before their latest Alice Springs horror show against St Kilda, so it was not particularly surprising that they ran Collingwood close.\n\nThe problem for Simon Goodwin\u2019s Demons is they started the season 0-5 and have a sub-90 percentage, so finals remain a longshot for a club that gave away its first-round pick this year to Essendon (a strategy that has consistently worked for them). Bayley Fritsch has kicked 207 goals in 100 games since the start of 2021, but he\u2019s had a challenging season and even at his best was criticised \u2013 including by Matthew Lloyd \u2013 for being selfish at times. The aftermath of Bayley Fritsch\u2019s ill-advised decision to play on near goal. Credit: AFL Photos Fritsch is back in form after being dropped ahead of round six, and kicked two of his three goals in the final quarter to give Melbourne a shot at upsetting the ladder-leading Pies. However, there was a brain-fade moment, with scores tied in the last term, when Fritsch marked 25 metres out, and instantly played on while not realising Isaac Quaynor was in front of him. That was bad enough without factoring in that teammate Tom Sparrow was on his own running towards the goal square.\n\nGoodwin probably takes the good with the bad from Fritsch, but it was certainly costly. What the 2021 premiership coach would be thrilled with was the Demons\u2019 disciplined team job on Collingwood superstar Nick Daicos, from Ed Langdon to Clayton Oliver and Judd McVee. Langdon did the lion\u2019s share of the lifting in a sacrificial role, but the overall willingness to stick at it was one of the most positive takeaways. Daicos finished with a modest 19 disposals, one goal and only four score involvements. Mission accomplished. All-Australian ruck race We are amid one of the most competitive races to be the starting ruckman in the All-Australian side.\n\nSelectors might need to consider picking two of seven-time All-Australian Max Gawn, Tristan Xerri and Tom De Koning, given how good they have been. Neither Xerri nor De Koning has ever made the final cut, although the Kangaroo made the extended squad last year. The last time two ruckmen made the team was in 2021, when Gawn (starting) and Nic Naitanui (bench) were selected. Xerri, De Koning and Gawn were excellent again in round 13, and offer different qualities. Tristan Xerri and Tom De Koning, pictured during their Good Friday battle, have built All-Australian ruck cases. Credit: Getty Images Xerri leads all ruckmen in clearances and hitouts-to-advantage; Gawn averages more marks, disposals and contested possessions than all his ruck peers; and the uber-athletic De Koning performs strongly in almost every relevant category. None of their teams are in the top eight, which continues an unhealthy narrative about ruckmen\u2019s worth, but that should not take away from how great each of them has been.\n\nOf note is that Xerri towelled Gawn in round two, while De Koning received coaches\u2019 votes against Xerri in round six (Xerri won the hitouts and was a tackling machine but De Koning kicked a goal and had more clearances in a big Carlton win). Gawn and De Koning are due to do battle in round 19. Jack Silvagni shut down in-form Bomber Nate Caddy to be one of Carlton\u2019s best players. Credit: AFL Photos Where do Blues fit? Carlton\u2019s unconvincing victory over Essendon on Sunday night provided little evidence that they have turned the corner and are set to challenge for a finals berth. Coach Michael Voss performed his best spin-doctor impression after their 38-point first-half lead disintegrated to only six with almost four-and-a-half minutes left, against a Bombers side missing Mason Redman, Sam Draper, Nick Bryan, Kyle Langford, Ben McKay, Zach Reid and Jordan Ridley.\n\nVoss said they addressed their constant second-half fadeouts during the bye a week earlier and that the worrying trend would not be instantly solved. Loading \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have, if you\u2019re in front by that much, and you\u2019re getting that many opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe harder one to solve is you\u2019re behind all the time, you get no opportunities, and you\u2019re trying to win your game from a completely negative base.\u201d The Blues could take heart from Jack Silvagni\u2019s job on Nate Caddy in his first game back, Zac Williams\u2019 reintegration as a forward, and tagger Alex Cincotta\u2019s effort on Zach Merrett. First-gamer Hudson O\u2019Keeffe also showed promise. Voss revealed afterwards that the 202-centimetre ruckman made significant strides as a forward in the past month to earn his shot.",

    "text": "The Socceroos were a bit on the nose with the public. Osieck had allowed the ageing \u201cGolden Generation\u201d to hang on for too long, and his style of football was hardly inspiring. Later that year, in their wisdom, Football Federation Australia scheduled back-to-back friendlies, both away, against Brazil and France. Rare chances for them to measure up against true global yardsticks.\n\nIt was 2013, and Australia had just sealed a spot at the World Cup in Brazil. Josh Kennedy was the saviour, thanks to his iconic late header against Iraq in front of 80,000 people in Sydney. But there was no saving the unpopular Holger Osieck, who was sacked three months later, despite delivering Australia\u2019s third successive qualification.\n\nCritics accused the Socceroos of making the Australian game look like a \u201cjoke\u201d on the world stage with their \u201cspineless\u201d performances, and several players of outstaying their welcome in the team. As soon as he returned to the team hotel after game two in Paris, Osieck was dismissed, and moves were immediately afoot to get the federation\u2019s No.1 coaching target, Ange Postecoglou, out of his contract at Melbourne Victory, thus setting in train a series of events that would soon lead to Postecoglou taking over and regenerating the squad, Mark Schwarzer\u2019s retirement, and the handing over of the gloves to Ryan, who will win his 100th cap on Wednesday morning (AEST) by hopefully contributing to what would be one of the best moments of his career.\n\nFor that not to happen, the Socceroos would need to turn in a stinker the likes of which they have not had in 12 years. Not since that day in Paris. Or that other day in Bras\u00edlia. That is how bad they would have to be to miss out on the 2026 World Cup from here. That is how long ago they last lost by five goals or more.\n\nA lifetime ago: Lucas Neill and Holger Osieck in 2013. Credit: Penny Stephens\n\nThat is the sort of heist Saudi Arabia has to pull off in Jeddah.\n\nIt is an unfathomable thought on multiple levels. So far in this qualifying phase, the Saudis have scored only six goals in nine games \u2013 so to do it, they\u2019d essentially need to reproduce that whole output in one match. Only twice before have the Socceroos ever lost a competitive match (not friendlies) by 5-0 or worse, and not since 1997.",

    "text": "\u201cSo that was one of my better ones,\u201d said Mickelson, who added a birdie at No. 18 for a 6-under 65 and a 54-hole total of 13-under 200, two shots off the pace. \u201cEven I was a bit surprised.\u201d\n\nMickelson\u2019s birdie from the bunker at No. 17 with his back to the flagstick overshadowed Joaqu\u00edn Niemann outlasting a charge from a group of major champions to win the event in Gainesville, Virginia. Even as Niemann celebrated onstage, the chatter from patrons around the property remained squarely on Mickelson\u2019s wizardry.\n\nThe six-time major championship winner, who will turn 55 next week, treated a disbelieving gallery to perhaps the most improbable shot of his career - which is saying something for one of the most creative players in history - during Sunday\u2019s weather-delayed final round of LIV Golf Virginia at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club.\n\nThe moment unfolded after Mickelson landed his approach at the par-4 17th in a bunker guarding the left front of the green. Facing an uphill lie, Mickelson glanced at the target, addressed the ball for the last time with his right side pointed at the green and proceeded into his backswing gripping his sand wedge.\n\nAt contact, the ball sailed high and travelled practically behind Mickelson\u2019s head, landing within two feet of the pin and trickling into the cup, triggering a wild celebration from his legion of fans who had endured miserable conditions to track Mickelson\u2019s round to completion.\n\nPhil Mickelson during a LIV tournament. Credit: AP\n\n\u201cMan, he created some Phil magic there,\u201d said Bryson DeChambeau, playing in the threesome with Mickelson and finishing tied for fourth at 13 under. \u201cYou could just see his wheels turning, and then he hit the shot, and I got the perfect angle of it. \u2026 I go, \u2018Oh my gosh, he\u2019s going to make it,\u2019 and it went in the hole, and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s got to be one of the greatest shots I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe dazzling shot was the highlight of LIV Golf\u2019s second stop in three years in the shadow of the nation\u2019s capital, where the tour\u2019s future has been oft debated. In February, Tiger Woods joined PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan and player director Adam Scott in a White House meeting with President Donald Trump and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund that bankrolls LIV Golf, for negotiations to reunify the fractured sport.",

    "text": "From Harbour to Harbour 2 is the second incarnation of a project in which Sharifian\u2019s band, Lian, is joined by didgeridoo virtuoso William Barton and his mother, singer Aunty Delmae Barton. The concept, however, was better than the execution, as where I was sitting the bottom-end sound was sludgy, and the didgeridoo\u2019s nuances were largely lost.\n\nMohsen Sharifian\u2019s folkloric music comes from the southern Iranian coast on the Persian Gulf, and for the local Iranian community Sharifian has the star power of Elvis, Michael Jackson and Taylor Swift rolled into one. He has done what Goran Bregovic did for Balkan music: locate it within the universal dance beat of a thumping bass drum \u2013 here an electronic wallop triggered by Morteza Palizdan\u2019s foot \u2013 and take it to the world.\n\nI had a little glimpse of what it would be like to be a god. From my box in Chatswood\u2019s Concert Hall, high above the front edge of the stage, I gazed down on a seething mass of humanity in what was effectively a mosh-pit, only with seating getting the way. The excitement of these people was as explosive as the music.\n\nBarton and Aunty Delmae only topped and tailed a generous show that started 35 minutes late, while we, in a new low for concert presentation, watched ads on a big screen. The rest embodied the instant party that\u2019s a Lian performance, with people dancing from the moment the band launched into the raucous Eshkeleh, and only stopping when Sharifian addressed us.\n\nHe\u2019s a virtuoso player of the ney-anban, an Iranian bagpipe with a sound that\u2019s shriller and even more transfixing than the Celtic version. His band also contains a second ney-anban player, his daughter Liana, whose main solo incorporated a dissonance that sliced through one like shards of glass, and whose instrument was adorned with a string of pom-poms, so when she twirled while playing, these gracefully arced around her.\n\nFrom the moment the band\u2019s formidable density \u2013 having three hand-drummers, an oud player and an electric bassist \u2013 fully kicked in, you understood why such a piercing instrument is demanded. Sharifian also sings, although the primary vocalist was the impressive Aka Safavi, who also had to scale this wall of sound, and did so more as a seasoned professional than as the natural charismatic that is Sharifian. The lyrics, meanwhile, sometimes drew on Omar Khayyam\u2019s poetry.\n\nMore than anything this concert was the sound of joy: a joy that engulfed a room more used to hosting polite applause with rumps firmly glued to seats. Intermittently the mood could change to the pensive beauty of Reza Kashi\u2019s oud, but that pounding ersatz bass drum, intent on stoving in one\u2019s ribcage, was not to be denied, and soon enough we were back in a musical frenzy, with the ecstatic response it engendered. It was just a shame the sound was so muddy.",

    "text": "It's going to take 'all three tiers' of government to see an improvement in road conditions.\n\nReports of issues on roads by cyclists have tripled since 2022. Source: Supplied\n\nAussie road users are growing increasingly fed up with the deteriorating state of the tarmac across the country. New data reveals reports of sub-par roads and bike paths have tripled in the past three years, with \"no signs of slowing down\".\n\nWhile the number of reports correlates with an uptick in Aussies opting to travel on their bikes, the state of roads poses an \"increasing risk\" to the wellbeing of cyclists, according to Danny Gorog, CEO of council reporting app Snap Send Solve.\n\nCycling advocacy group Bicycle NSW's CEO Peter McLean has called on authorities to pay attention to the complaints, telling Yahoo it's critically important \"all three tiers\" of government acknowledge that there are more cyclists than ever on the roads.\n\n\"We need to evolve and react to managing our assets and infrastructure more appropriately,\" he said. \"People want better, more consistent infrastructure, and where they're not seeing it, they are reporting it,\" he said.\n\nThere have been thousands of reports of dodgy roads in the past year alone. Source: Supplied\n\nCycling has seen a 'massive uptake' in last five years\n\nSince 2020, cycling has seen a \"massive uptake\", according to McLean. Now, over five million Australians are riding a bike every week, particularly with the advent of e-bikes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith that, has come a rise in complaints on the state of infrastructure meant to serve cyclists. Last year, there was a \"record-breaking\" 5,235 reports of issues in bike paths including crumbling tarmac, regular debris in the way, as well as overgrown nature strips across the country, according to Snap Send Solve data.\n\n2025 looks like it's going to be even worse with 3,153 reports already recorded between January and May this year.\n\n\"This rapid growth strongly suggests that conditions on the ground are deteriorating year over year,\" Gorog told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nWhile the Snap Send Solve app itself is increasing in popularity among responsible citizens, he believes the rise in complaints is \"unlikely\" to be explained simply by reporting behaviour alone.\n\n\"It signals worsening infrastructure conditions, poor repairs, ageing bike lanes, and potentially inadequate maintenance cycles,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe warns the current pace of deterioration could \"undermine broader mobility goals and pose increasing risks to cyclists.\" Gorog hopes the insights will guide smarter investments and ongoing upgrades from authorities.\n\nBig threats impacting cyclists on Aussie roads\n\nIt's not just the quality of the roads putting cyclists at risk, but also fellow road users like car drivers. A disproportionate amount of crashes involve cyclists on Australian roads despite them being a small percentage of overall road users.\n\nLast year, cyclist deaths jumped from 34 in 2023 to 38 in 2024, an 11.8% increase, with motor vehicles involved in the majority of crashes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFootage shared earlier this year shows a scary near-miss between a driver and a cyclist in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick.\n\nCyclist Rory Meister told Yahoo News he thought it was \"absurd\" the driver didn't see him despite having flashing lights on his bike. He said incidents with drivers are alarmingly frequent.\n\nMcLean previously told Yahoo education and awareness are the first port of call for improving safety for cyclists. \"Fundamentally, we need better awareness at an early stage of when people are getting their licenses,\" he said.\n\n\"There's lots of great drivers out there and we just need to equalise everyone on the road.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?
