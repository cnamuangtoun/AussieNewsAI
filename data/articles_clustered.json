    "text": "Seven out of ten Aussies admit to calling in sick when they're actually fine.\n\nThis habit is costing businesses a whopping $7.3 billion each year because of lost work and adds up to 24.6 million days off.\n\nEven if you don't count mental health days, 68 per cent of Australians still say they've faked being sick.\n\nSeven in 10 Australians say they have called in sick to work when they are not ill. (iStock)\n\nThese numbers come from a new survey by comparison website iSelect .\n\nThey asked 1000 Australians why they pretend to be sick.\n\nThe top reason people fake sick days is lack of sleep.\n\nOne-third of those surveyed said they took a day off for this reason last year.\n\nNext up is wanting to relax and recharge, at 27 per cent, followed by needing a mental health day at 23.1 per cent.\n\nThe survey also found some differences between men and women.\n\nWomen were more likely to take a mental health day (26.6 per cent of women versus 19.5 per cent of men).\n\nThey were also more likely to take time off to care for family, like children (20.1 per cent versus 16.3 per cent of men).\n\nYounger Aussies more likely to 'chuck a sickie'\n\nThe study suggests that people fake sick days less often as they get older.\n\nYounger generations, especially those aged 18-24, are most likely to miss work because they're tired (44.1 per cent).",

    "text": "Indigenous employment rules have been dropped in two-thirds of Commonwealth contracts, meaning $70 billion worth of contracts did not have to hire a minimum number of Indigenous people or use Indigenous businesses.\n\nThe Audit Office found departments had exempted two-thirds of recorded contracts since 2016, or about 1,475 contracts, from requirements for at least 3 per cent of the workforce to be Indigenous, or that amount of components sourced from Indigenous-owned businesses.\n\nAuditors said the exemptions were given \"often for reasons that [were] unclear\".\n\nBut even among the contracts that were subject to Indigenous participation rules, just a fifth were actually assessed for compliance \u2014 with more than a quarter found to be non-compliant.\n\nCommonwealth contracts are subject to Indigenous participation rules if they exceed $7.5 million in value and more than half of that value is spent in a nominated industry in Australia \u2014 such as in construction, healthcare, industrial cleaning or wildlife management.\n\nConstruction is one of a number of sectors where Commonwealth contractors must comply with Indigenous participation rules, unless exempted. (AAP: Jono Searle)\n\nAuditors said contract exemptions were rising, and while some were legitimate exemptions, others were given with little explanation.\n\n\"The inappropriate use of exemptions impedes achievement of the Indigenous Procurement Policy\u2019s objectives,\" auditors said.\n\n\"Systems have been set up to allow potentially invalid exemptions.\"\n\nExemptions for non-compliance, missing assessments, outdated guidance\n\nOf those contracts that were exempted from Indigenous participation rules, a third listed their reason for exemption under the category \"other\".\n\nAuditors were told by the responsible agency, the National Indigenous Australians Agency, that contracts were sometimes exempted simply because they were \"in practice non-compliant\" with the rules.\n\nFor example, between July 2016 and September last year $35 billion worth of Defence Department contracts were exempted \u2014 with more than half of those contracts listed as \"other\" as the reason for exemption.\n\nIndigenous businesses pump $16b into economy but barriers still in place Photo shows Wiradjuri woman Tara Croker who launched startup Yaala Sparkling smiles at the camera while sitting indoors The Indigenous business sector is experiencing significant growth but challenges remain around access to capital, a lack of culturally safe support and entrenched racism.\n\nBut even among the 870 contracts where Indigenous participation rules were applied, the NIAA only assessed compliance of a fifth of those. Of those assessed, 28 per cent, or 45 contracts, were found not to have complied.\n\nThe agency had also not updated its guidance to contractors on navigating Indigenous participation rules since July 2020, despite reporting requirements changing in that time.\n\n\"A commitment to publish guidance tailored for Indigenous businesses was not met,\" the auditors found.\n\nIn a response to auditors, the National Indigenous Australians Agency said prior to the introduction of minimum requirements a decade ago, Indigenous businesses secured limited business from the Commonwealth, and the policy had \"significantly\" increased the rate of purchasing from Indigenous businesses.\n\nThe agency agreed to review its use of the \"other\" category for allowing exemptions, but argued it was the responsibility of Commonwealth departments to ensure each met their own obligations.",

Medical personnel, stewards and police cordoned off the area, with police investigating the incident.\n\nPortugal went on to win the game on penalties.\n\nSpain coach Luis de la Fuente addressed the incident at the start of his post-game news conference.\n\n\"Before we begin with the questions, I would like to express my condolences because a fan died in the stands today,\" de la Fuente said.\n\n\"My condolences to the family.\"\n\nRonaldo basks in adulation after victory\n\nOn the field, it was another trophy for Cristiano Ronaldo, as the Portugal star shed tears after helping his team win the Nations League.\n\nRonaldo scored to help Portugal draw level with Spain 2-2 in the final, then watched as his teammates won the penalty shootout 5-3.\n\n\"I have many titles with my clubs, but nothing is better than winning for Portugal,\" Ronaldo said.\n\n\"These are tears. It's mission accomplished and so much joy.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old Ronaldo had been the first to run out onto the field for the pre-game warm-up, sparking a huge roar from the Portugal supporters, including many wearing jerseys emblazoned with his name.\n\nHis appearance prompted many supporters to pull out their phones to record the superstar while they could still see him in action. Ronaldo conceded Saturday that he won't be able to play forever.\n\nThat was three days after he helped Portugal to its first win over Germany for 25 years, scoring the winner for a 2-1 victory in the Nations League semifinals.\n\nIn the final, he was driving the team again, though it was initially a frustrating game as Spain's hard-working defenders limited his chances.\n\nNuno Mendes fired Portugal level after Martin Zubimendi opened the scoring for Spain. Then Mikel Oyarzabal put Spain ahead 2-1 at the break.\n\nBut Ronaldo was in the right place at the right time to fire home the equaliser from Mendes' deflected cross in the 61st, setting off joyous scenes among his faithful fans. It was Ronaldo's 138th goal for Portugal. Nobody has ever scored more for their country.\n\nRonaldo kept trying in what was his record-extending 221st appearance for the country, but eventually had to go off exhausted in the 88th to standing ovations from fans and a hug from coach Roberto Mart\u00ednez.\n\nRonaldo said he was carrying an injury into the game.\n\n\"I had already felt it during the warm-up, I had been feeling it for some time, but for the national team, if I had to break my leg, I would have broken it,\" Ronaldo said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

He posted \"this chapter is over\" on social media after the club's last Saudi Pro League game of the season.\n\nOn Saturday he said he had all but decided not to go to the Club World Cup despite \"quite a few\" offers from participating clubs to play there.\n\nWhatever club Ronaldo plays for, he will keep striving for Portugal.\n\n\"I have lived in many countries, I have played for many clubs, but when it's about Portugal, it is always a special feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "A regional business owner says she has been advised to purchase a diesel generator by Western Australia's state-run power provider if she wants a guaranteed electricity supply to her hotel.\n\nBremer Bay, 500 kilometres south of Perth, has a population of about 571, rising steeply on weekends and holiday periods as tourists flock to the pristine coastline.\n\nBusinesses and residents said power supply to the town, which sits at the edge of the state's largest energy network, the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), has not kept pace with the growing population.\n\nOver the Easter and Anzac Day holiday period, residents were hit with half a dozen power outages over 10 days.\n\nTourist numbers are placing strain on Bremer Bay's energy infrastructure. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nFor 22 years Melissa Joy has owned the Bremer Bay Resort, a pub, restaurant and motel that can serve up to 450 guests at any one time.\n\n\"Over the years, there have been lots of power issues, but in recent months we've noticed it growing increasingly worse, which is quite alarming,\" she said.\n\n\"We have outages quite regularly and quite often, anywhere from a 10-second outage to one hour or even more on a regular basis.\n\n\"It seems to be worse when we have high numbers coming to town.\"\n\nMelissa Joy says the outages are more common during holiday periods. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nOutages cause major losses\n\nWestern Power blamed the outages on severe weather and \"atypical\" demand.\n\nBut with tourism increasingly critical to the town's economy, Ms Joy said outages during peak periods were not acceptable.\n\n\"We had to close for an entire night in December. That's our peak time. So that's $30,000 that you're not going to make,\" she said.\n\n\"It has a huge impact, it's highly disruptive and really quite unacceptable.\"\n\nBremer Bay businesses are turning to diesel generators to cope with blackouts. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nWhen the issue was raised with Western Power, Ms Joy said she was advised to purchase a generator for the business at her own cost.\n\n\"The electricity bills to run this business are over $65,000 a year,\" she said.\n\n\" It'll be $30,000 to get a small-sized generator, which isn't going to power everything on site. \"\n\nWestern Power did not respond to claims that it had advised businesses in the region to purchase diesel generators.\n\nBremer Bay is a tourist hotspot on the edge of the South West Interconnected System power grid. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nIn a statement, the power utility said it understood the frustrations that unplanned power outages caused residents, and acknowledged the community was prone to more blackouts.\n\nIt said \"some back-up power supply\" was in place to support the community, but faults that occurred within the Bremer town site could limit its utility.\n\nThe situation highlights the complexity WA's legislated power monopoly leaves some regional customers facing.\n\nWestern Power, a statutory corporation, is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the SWIS.\n\nBut Synergy is responsible for the generation and sales of power to customers connected to the network.\n\nBusiness owners said the backup wind-diesel power station, owned and operated by Synergy, was inadequate to service Bremer Bay and nearby settlements.\n\n'Worst year we've had'\n\nBremer Bay General Store manager Danielle Formica said the business had spent $30,000 on a new generator to keep the shop running.\n\nDanielle Formica says the general store upgraded its generator to manage blackouts. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\n\"It's probably the worst year we've had over the years; there were three occasions over the course of four days where we had to run solely on cash,\" she said.\n\n\"The locals are a population of about 300\u2013400, but the majority [of people in town during peak season] are 15 to 20,000-plus tourists.\n\n\"We're not just going to give an IOU, so we lost thousands here at the store.\"\n\nA Synergy spokesperson said it did not manage the Bremer Bay power supply network, but its wind-diesel plant had the capacity to provide 40 per cent of Bremer Bay's energy requirements.\n\nSynergy runs a wind-diesel power plant that can provide 40 per cent of the town's energy needs. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nIt also said four Synergy-owned back-up diesel generators were available to Western Power when managing network outages in the region.\n\nHowever, the patchwork of backup energy infrastructure has infuriated residents who are also being forced to find backup options to power essential appliances.\n\nPaul Taylor bought a house at Bremer Bay with the aim of retiring on the south coast.\n\nResidents in the town are also complaining about the frequency of power outages. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nBut the 66-year-old, diagnosed with neuropathy of the diaphragm, requires a CPAP machine to help him sleep.\n\n\"Lying down and going to sleep at night-time is an issue as far as power failure is a concern,\" Mr Taylor said.\n\n\"My diaphragm doesn't work, and when I lie down to go to sleep, my diaphragm falls against my lungs, and it makes it very difficult for me to breathe, so my doctors have put me on a CPAP machine so I can sleep at night.\n\n\"I'm looking at options, having to buy a generator or a CPAP machine that has its own battery system if there is a power failure, but these things are like $10,000, so it's not a good option.\"\n\nWestern Power said it was exploring solutions to improve reliability.",

    "text": "After a flawless fortnight in Paris, Jannik Sinner was on the brink of capturing his first French Open title after a dominant run on the clay courts of Roland-Garros.\n\nFacing defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, the top-ranked Italian was firmly in control.\n\nSinner's deep groundstrokes, excellent service, heavy top spin, and subtle variations had worn down the Spaniard, who found himself 5-3 down and trailing 0-40 in the fourth set, and facing three match points.\n\nAt that moment, it felt like the best of all possible worlds for the 23-year-old Sinner.\n\nBut then the momentum swung. Alcaraz fought back, and saved the first match point when Sinner sent a forehand long. On the second, Sinner missed a return. The third ended with Alcaraz winning a short baseline exchange.\n\nSinner had just let his chance slip away.\n\nFrom there, Alcaraz produced one of the greatest comebacks in Roland-Garros history to win the longest final ever played on the Parisian dirt \u2014 5 hours and 29 minutes.\n\n\"It's an amazing trophy, so I won't sleep tonight very well, but it's OK,\" Sinner said during the trophy ceremony.\n\nThere is hardly anything between the two best players in tennis at the moment, who have now combined to win the past six Grand Slam titles and appear poised to build one of the sport's most compelling rivalries in the years ahead.\n\nThe duel delivered a match of rare intensity, filled with punishing baseline rallies, exquisite drop shots, and brilliant passing shots \u2014 thrilling a packed Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nReflecting on the match in his post-final press conference, Sinner tried to draw positives from a devastating loss.\n\n\"Obviously, this one hurts,\" he said.\n\n\"There's not so much to say right now. But again, I'm happy with how we're trying to improve every day and put myself in these kinds of positions. It was a very high-level match, that's for sure.\n\n\"I'm happy to be part of it. But yeah, the final result hurts.\"\n\nIt was a particularly tough ending for Sinner, who had not dropped a set on his way to the final, including a dominant semifinal win over three-time French Open champion Novak Djokovic.\n\nBefore facing Alcaraz, Sinner had never lost a Grand Slam final, winning his first three. A victory would have made him just the fifth man in the Open Era to win three consecutive major titles.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure you are going to be a champion, not once but many, many times,\" Alcaraz told him during the trophy ceremony.\n\n\"It is a privilege to share the court with you in every tournament, making history with you.\"\n\nSinner, who will remain world number one, said he will lean on his family and loved ones to recover from the loss.\n\n\"Now it's my time to take something from the close people I have,\" he said.\n\n\"As I've always said, before my career started, I never would've imagined finding myself in this position. It wasn't even a dream because it felt so far away \u2014 I wasn't even thinking about it.\n\n\"Now I find myself here, playing the longest final in the history of Roland-Garros.

(ABC Far North: Amanda Cranston)\n\nHayes eventually found an escape in the written word.\n\n\" I started writing a fantasy story and my main character was living in a beautiful forest and I could mentally escape there. \"\n\nInitially, without a laptop, Hayes hand-wrote the first draft of her self-published fantasy trilogy, the Rim Walker series, while flat on her back.\n\n\"After being stagnant for so long trying to heal, it felt like a gift and that I hadn't wasted that time,\" she said, reflecting on how writing gave her a fresh start.\n\nNow a published author of three novels, Hayes credits the creative writing process as a therapeutic outlet that allowed her to find joy again, despite the pain.\n\n\"It helped me through an incredibly tough time mentally and physically and I no longer felt like I'd lost anything or life was punishing me.\"\n\nWriting helps avoid internalising trauma\n\nCreative writing expert Edwina Shaw isn't surprised.\n\nThe writer, educator and tutor in the University of Queensland's creative writing department said the therapeutic benefits of writing went far beyond the stereotypical journalling exercise.\n\nEdwina Shaw teaches creative writing to students and helps them create their own happy endings. (Supplied: Edwina Shaw)\n\n\"It's about using the craft of writing to create something beautiful from the pain, trauma or loss someone has suffered,\" she said.\n\nShe said research had shown that the process of handwriting was very calming on the body and a subduer of our stress systems, while creativity was \"a natural calmer of the vagus nerve\".\n\nShe said writing could help to avoid internalising powerful emotions such as anger, which was associated with experiences of grief or trauma.\n\nMs Shaw says there are many therapeutic benefits of writing. (Supplied: Edwina Shaw)\n\n\"We need to separate ourselves from what's happening in our lives and reframe the way we think about it,\" she said.\n\n\"Creative writing can help us do that, whether writing a poem, a song, a novel or even writing comedy.\"\n\nHealing through songwriting\n\nThat was singer-songwriter Greta Stanley's experience when she lost her home and contents in the December 2023 flood that ripped through Far North Queensland.\n\n\"Songwriting was a big part of my healing process, 100 per cent,\" Stanley said.\n\nGreta Stanley says songwriting has been incredibly healing for her.

(Supplied: Greta Stanley)\n\nWriting your own happily ever after\n\nBut creative writing expert Ms Shaw said the writing did not have to be an autobiographical piece to be effective, and acknowledged that for some, that would be too confronting.\n\n\"You don't have to write about your trauma, you can give your experiences and your emotional burden to a fictional character,\" she said.\n\n\"Sometimes life is too close or too hard to write about it as yourself, so you can invent a character \u2026 and give your experience to someone else \u2026 change the ending.\"\n\nCanberra-based widow Emma Grey took that approach in her novel after the death of her husband Jeff.\n\nAfter her husband died, Emma Grey wrote a fiction novel about a widow finding love again. (Supplied: Emma Grey)\n\n\"I desperately wanted to know that this fictional character was going to be OK and by extension, that I was going to be OK,\" she said.\n\n\"I found incredible comfort in writing about grief and it was a very cathartic process for me.\"\n\nShe said using writing to navigate the trauma of losing her husband allowed her to manage the myriad of feelings that would creep up, often without warning, and channel them into something \"useful\".\n\nGrey has gone on to become a bestselling author. (Supplied: Emma Grey)\n\nThe Last Love Note, her novel written while grieving, sold more than 100,000 copies in the United States alone, becoming a beacon of hope for many who had lost loved ones, Grey said.\n\n\"I have since been inundated with messages from around the world from readers sharing their stories of loss and how my novel helped them through tough times,\" she said.",

    "text": "Architect Enrico Taglietti had a lasting impact on Canberra, designing many well-known buildings that stand to this day.\n\nFor those familiar with his work, those buildings represent a golden era of design and hope for the future for the fledgling capital.\n\nTaglietti first arrived in Australia in 1955, making Canberra his home in the early '60s.\n\nWithin the Taglietti household architecture was not just a job, but also poetry and art.\n\nTaglietti's proposal for a visitor centre on Canberra's Red Hill in 1962. (Supplied: Canberra Museum and Gallery )\n\nOften it was the subject of conversation around the dinner table with his wife Franca and their two daughters Tanja and Tabitha.\n\nNow a new exhibition, Taglietti: Life in Design, at the Canberra Museum and Gallery offers insight into the mind of one of Australia's most accomplished architects, almost 100 years after his birth.\n\n'The air we breathed'\n\nIn one of the rooms of the exhibition is a table Taglietti made.\n\nThis table was used by the Taglietti family as a place to come together and talk about design. It was later used in Taglietti's home office. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nThe piece of furniture is surrounded by Taglietti's colourful sketches, ideas for a cafe in the city airport, a pitch for a visitor centre at Red Hill, and thoughts about what the outskirts of the capital could look like.\n\nThe table has stains on it, a burn mark here, a scratch there. For his daughter Tanja Taglietti the table symbolises the ethos of her family home in Griffith.\n\nTanja Taglietti helped put together the exhibition. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\n\"Nothing was static in our household, everything changed,\" Ms Taglietti said.\n\n\" My sister and I were often encouraged to make our own changes to the house and that was acceptable because, you know, you could change it again. Nothing is permanent. \"\n\nThere are images around the exhibition of Tanja and her sister Tabitha visiting the construction site for what would become the Cinema Center located on Bunda Street.\n\nEnrico Taglietti walks with his daughters and their friend through the construction site of the Cinema Center in 1965. (Supplied: Ted Richards, Taglietti Archive)\n\n\"It was the air we breathed, it was a normality,\" Ms Taglietti said.\n\nEnrico and Franca's partnership played a pivotal role in Taglietti's creations.\n\nWhen Tabitha and Tanja came along, they too got a say.\n\n\"Mum was, we all were, made to feel that our voice counted \u2026 even in his buildings we were made to feel that we were important in that design.\"\n\nA model of Taglietti's Cinema Center design on show in the exhibition. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\n'The invisible city'\n\nTaglietti spent his youth in Ethiopia with his parents, before returning to Milan and attending the Milian Polytechnic University.\n\nHe and Franca decided to make Canberra their home in the early '60s.\n\nFranca was a visionary in her own right and was often involved in design discussions. (Supplied: Canberra Museum and Gallery)\n\nThe open space and clear air of the capital reminded Taglietti of his youth.\n\n\"He has responded beautifully to the context to what he found when he came here, which he called the 'invisible city', the 'dream City',\" exhibition co-curator Dr Silvia Micheli said.\n\n\" It was a city that was growing very fast and it was waiting for an architect to give a special answer. \"\n\nExhibition co-curator Silvia Micheli says Taglietti called Canberra the \"dream city\". (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nThat answer came in the form of the Italian Embassy in 1967, Dickson Library in 1968, the Flynn Primary School in 1972 and Giralang Primary School in 1974, among other designs.\n\nFor those living in Canberra at the time, Taglietti captured the way of life.\n\nSenior curator Virgina Rigney grew up in the city and said Taglietti's designs showed his commitment to listening.\n\n\"I think watching, looking, absorbing, not dictating \u2014 I think that's a really critical part of his architectural approach and that's why we've called the exhibition Life in Design because it's responding to the life of people,\" she said.\n\nSenior curator Virginia Rigney says Taglietti's designs have had a lasting impact on her. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\n\"It was really important for children like me in Canberra who grew up here, who experienced schools and community centres, the cinema, the library \u2026 these kinds of places actually spoke to how we wanted to live.\"\n\nWhich meant when it came to designing homes, he often had to ask some tricky questions.\n\n\"He would sit down carefully with people and [ask], 'So how do you want to live?',\" Ms Rigney said.\n\n\"He even asked a couple: 'Do you love your wife?', and you know, they were a bit shocked. And he said, 'Well, it's because I need to know if you need space from one another in your house.\n\nTaglietti's work featured in a Women's Weekly magazine. (Supplied: Canberra Museum and Gallery)\n\n\"He wasn't assuming people needed a living room and a kitchen. But actually, how they wanted to live.\"\n\nThe changing fabric of 'the dream city'\n\nChange was a central element of Taglietti's artistic approach.\n\nWhen the Flynn Primary School was closed in 2006, Taglietti rallied with the community to see the building put to use.\n\nTaglietti designed the Australian War Memorial Annex in Mitchell in 1977. (Supplied: Taglietti Family Archive)\n\n\"He was excited that they had managed to come up with a different use for that school, which is a community hub as well as a childcare centre. So ... very much things should change if they need to,\" Ms Taglietti said.\n\nCanberra has evolved since Taglietti first cast his eyes on the capital, but his focus on community lives on in his designs.\n\nTaglietti designed the Dickson Library in 1968. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nThe curators hope that the exhibition will allow visitors to see Canberra in Taglietti's vision.\n\n\"Canberra is often diminished within the national conversation as a place just where politics happens,\" Dr Micheli said.\n\n\"But actually, it's a living community. They [Enrico and Franca] could have chosen anywhere in the world to be and they chose here.\"\n\nA model showing one of Taglietti's designs on show at the Canberra Museum and Gallery. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nFor Tanja Taglietti, the exhibition brings together family memories and has transformed the gallery space into a semblance of her childhood.\n\n\"It's magical. It's tranquil. It reflects the handmade, the human touch, I think,\" she said.\n\n\" I could live in this space. \"\n\nThe exhibition is open until February 22, 2026.",

It's a rare opportunity to be able to say I own a dinosaur\".\n\nMilano, the saltasaurus, is now an eye-catching sight for people passing her property as they come down Nine Mile Road into the small historic lakeside town of Milang.\n\nMs Vogelsang, who has lived in the town for 25 years, is hoping that Milano's presence will attract a few more day trippers to the town of 800, located just over an hour south-east of Adelaide.\n\nMs Vogelsang says she wants Milano to make people smile. (ABC South East SA: Caroline Horn)\n\nOnce a thriving paddle-steamer town on the banks of Lake Alexandrina, Milang attracted national attention when former prime minister Kevin Rudd visited during the Millennium Drought, and the area is again experiencing dry times.\n\nHowever, Ms Vogelsang hopes Milano will bring a smile to residents and visitors as they drive past, toot their horns or stop to take a selfie.\n\nThe unofficial town mascot ended up there, next to the neighbour's bemused miniature ponies, by pure chance after an impulsive purchase by one of Ms Vogelsang's friends went a bit wrong.\n\n\"He swears he was sober,\" she said.\n\nHer friend had paid $1,500 for Milano during an online auction, intending him to become an eccentric garden ornament on his property in Deniliquin in country New South Wales.\n\nMs Vogelsang's daughter Emma says the decision to buy Milano was \"the best ever\". (ABC South East SA: Caroline Horn)\n\nUnfortunately, for Ms Vogelsang's friend, the reality of relocating an 8-metre long, 3m-high animatronic saltasaurus dinosaur from the auction house to rural NSW within two days of purchase proved too difficult and too costly.\n\n\"He threw his hands in the air and said, 'I give up,'\" Ms Vogelsang said.\n\n\"When he said, 'Do you want to buy him?' I said, 'Absolutely'.\"\n\nMs Vogelsang paid $200 for Milano and said once the decision had been made, things steamrolled from there.\n\nWith a borrowed car trailer and the head detached for the journey, Milano made his way down the South Eastern Freeway and through the nearest large town of Strathalbyn.\n\nMilang was once a working, busy port for paddle-steamers but is now a small farming and tourism hub. (ABC South East SA: Caroline Horn)\n\n\"It was like, 'I'll just stick him in my front yard and that way everyone who can come by gets to enjoy him as well',\" Ms Vogelsang said.\n\nThe community, after many doing double takes on an initial drive past, has embraced the dinosaur with requests rolling in for him to be dressed up for Christmas, Halloween and football finals.\n\nMs Vogelsang's co-worker at the town bakery, Kerri Woodgate, said Milano had already attracted visitors from surrounding towns in the three weeks since he arrived.\n\n\"It's been really, really positive for the town,\" she said.\n\n\"Kids love it.\"\n\nMs Vogelsang's daughter Emma agreed.\n\n\"Best idea ever,\" she said.",

Because she was a single woman who did not have reproductive health problems. And because she lived in Western Australia.\n\nWA's IVF limits for single women\n\nWhile every state and territory in Australia has its own laws concerning IVF, WA is the only one that still rules out an unpartnered woman from accessing the procedure unless a doctor deems her to have reproductive problems (along with other restrictions against same-sex couples).\n\n\"To my shock and surprise \u2026 I was not eligible to access my own eggs and use them for the final stages of IVF and that's because I was not classified as 'sub-fertile',\" Jane told the ABC's Life Matters program.\n\nAs a single woman in WA who did not have reproductive health problems, Jane was denied her IVF choice.

Number two, under the constitution you have freedom of interstate trade, commerce and intercourse,\" he said.\n\n\"And number three, in Western Australia there are restrictions about moving donor eggs, donor sperm and donor embryos, you need permission of the Reproductive Technology Council \u2014 but these eggs, her eggs, were not donor eggs, so she had full freedom to move them,\" he said.\n\nSurrogacy lawyer Stephen Page has long called for WA's legislation to be updated.

(ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\n\"It's kind of like toilet paper in COVID-19,\" Ms Follan said.\n\n\"It doesn't necessarily need to be that way, but it is.\"\n\nIn 2024, Ms Follan paid about $4 a kilogram for organic green coffee beans, which have jumped to $14 a kilogram.\n\n\"You don't realise how much work goes into that daily coffee,\" she said.\n\nPablo & Rusty's Coffee Roasters 2024 research shows the breakdown of costs for a small takeaway flat white. (ABC News: Lindsay Dunbar)\n\n\"Thousands of hands have gone into back-breaking work for it. These are hand-picked cherries from a tree that are then pulped, that are then dried in the sun for 30 days, rotated by hand.\"\n\nHowever, Ms Follan said the coffee itself only accounted for about 13 per cent of the cost per cup.\n\nHer cafe makes about a gross $1 profit off each cup sold \u2014 and that is before deducting the cost of rent, wages, packaging and milk.\n\n\"The outcome should look like cafes increasing their prices, we're talking 50 cents, but that depends on [the type of] coffee,\" she said.\n\nHome-brewed prices increasing\n\nCoffee lovers who choose to brew at home are also seeing prices skyrocket.\n\nA closer look at supermarket specials Photo shows Smiths chips, Cadbury favourites and Chobani yogurt against a chart that moves up and down. The ABC analysed the online prices of nearly 44,000 products at Coles and Woolworths, revealing a sales technique used on thousands of items.\n\nThe supermarket price of coffee has risen sharply over the past six months.\n\nAustralia's two major supermarket chains, Coles and Woolworths, both said external pressures were driving record-high coffee prices.\n\n\"We are doing what we can to help customers find value when they shop with us,\" a Coles spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nA Woolworths spokesperson said retail price hikes were directly linked to supplier and manufacturer increases.\n\n\"The industry is managing higher commodity prices of green coffee beans, and we are working with our suppliers to ensure we have a range of products in these categories to suit all budgets,\" they said.\n\nBusiness costs booming\n\nOne of the country's largest specialty roasters, Essential Coffee, sells about 180 tonnes of coffee a year to customers in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, retailing at about $35 to $55 per kilogram.\n\nChief executive Todd Hiscock said his business's labour costs had increased 9 per cent, rent 29 per cent and insurance 6 per cent over the past two years.\n\nOn top of that, the wholesale cost of coffee has increased by 119 per cent since November 2023.\n\nTodd Hiscock says there have been disruptions to global coffee supply. (ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\n\"[The] Chinese have very much converted from tea to coffee,\" he said.\n\n\"They're buying up unprecedented levels of coffee supplies, often they're taking a whole Brazilian stock load in ways that's never been seen before.\"\n\nMr Hiscock said on top of increasing global demand, \"climate-driven weather events\" had disrupted supply.\n\n\"You're seeing crops just get wiped out by massive frosts and storms and cyclone events, bushfires too,\" he said.\n\n\"Also the removal of crops with more urbanisation.\"\n\nThe growing popularity of alternative milks, which can cost up to double cow's milk, also adds to price pressures.\n\nPlant-based milk costs 20 to 100 per cent more than cow's milk. (ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\n\"For a barista quality one as a wholesaler, we're paying as much as $4, even more than $4 a litre,\" Mr Hiscock said.\n\nHe said Australia's median coffee prices needed to increase to between $8 to $12 per cup, similar to what North Americans paid, or risk losing the supply of coffee to bigger, more lucrative markets.\n\n\"We've got to come to the party and pay in a competitive global market,\" he said.\n\n\"It's hard because people are very sensitive to their beloved coffee and when you move the price up, you find not just a lot of negative reaction, you find some very terse expletives.\"\n\nCafes about more than coffee\n\nMs Follan said predictions of $10 flat whites may be pre-emptive but not impossible.\n\nThe rising cost of coffee beans is driving cafes to increase prices. (ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\n\"We're not saying that it needs to reach, crazy, crazy numbers,\" she said.\n\n\"I do think it should be around the $6 to $7.\"\n\nBut she said a \"cafe is a lot more than just a cup of coffee\".\n\n\"You could be going in because you like the playlist or you like the ambience, it's an experience as well,\" she said.",

    "text": "In any case, against total federal spending last year of nearly $US7 trillion, it is but a drop in the ocean, and only goes to show how difficult it is to find serious savings in government administration, even when given a free hand with the headcount. The rampant corruption and incompetence that Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency expected to find in the Washington and wider government machine has turned out to be largely an illusion, and many of the cuts he has managed to make seem to have done more harm than good. This is not to argue that it\u2019s not worth trying, or that you cannot make public services more efficient. But it takes time, substantial upfront investment, and the savings are generally not as big as anticipated. Slowly but surely \u2013 and at varying speeds \u2013 major economies around the world are going bust. Credit: Bloomberg To nobody\u2019s great surprise, it transpires that the skills needed to run a successful business do not transfer easily to the public sector, where the disciplines of the bottom line, the profit motive and competitive markets don\u2019t exist.\n\nLoading The shame of it is that the Musk who built Tesla and SpaceX into two of the world\u2019s most successful companies over a period of nearly two decades has been almost entirely absent while at DOGE these past four or five months. Instead, we have seen a reckless, chainsaw-wielding \u2013 and if the American press is to be believed, drug-fuelled \u2013 Musk who, like his one-time boss Donald Trump, seems to regard government more as performative art than public service. We can all point to myriad examples of public sector waste, of unfathomable spending decisions and stultifying, jobsworth bureaucracy, but the imagined savings from addressing these things nearly always turn out to be a mirage. In Britain, Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK claims there is \u00a37 billion to be saved by scrapping public sector spending on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Sadly, no such saving exists.\n\nRecent government figures showed just \u00a327 million ($56 million) was spent by the civil service on DEI measures during 2022-23. This might well be \u00a327m too much, but it is not going to solve Britain\u2019s debt crisis. The two big cash-burners in advanced economies\u2019 state spending are public sector salaries and welfare, and both desperately need to be addressed if Western democracies are ever to extract themselves from now mountainous debt. Musk has comprehensively failed on the first of these missions, and not surprisingly so. The sort of productivity-improving automation and digitalisation we see widely applied in the private sector to stay competitive is a marathon, not a sprint, and it requires precision in planning and execution. None of these characteristics was on display from the tech bros sent in to tackle the bloated size of the American state. Their approach was one of slash and burn rather than the slow, methodical re-engineering of government needed to achieve sustainable savings and productivity improvement.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump shows little or no appetite for meaningful entitlement reform. OK, some attempt is being made to trim spiralling Medicaid spending, but it\u2019s half-hearted and is really only there as a gesture to appease fiscal hawks among House Republicans. Nobody can tell you exactly when the storm will break, but Musk\u2019s failure brings the final reckoning that much closer. The bottom line is that Trump is as much a creature of fantasy economics as any. He wants both low taxes and high spending, and expects economic growth to make up the difference. It\u2019s the same delusion as Liz Truss, only very much more dangerous in its seeming rejection of fiscal orthodoxies.\n\nUnlike Britain, America is the beating heart of the global financial system, and if US debt markets go belly-up they\u2019ll take everyone else down with them. Back here in Britain, Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, shows similarly little sign of getting to grips with the leviathan of public spending as she puts the finishing touches to next Wednesday\u2019s spending review. Public sector salary costs are rising, not falling, and while ministers talk the talk on welfare reform, their approach to the issue is no more convincing than that of Trump. It\u2019s just a little tinkering around the edges. Simply getting working-age benefits back to their pre-pandemic level would save \u00a349 billion a year \u2013 more than enough to avoid tax rises and fund the desired increase in defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP, Jeremy Hunt, Reeves\u2019 Conservative predecessor as chancellor, points out. Spending on disability benefits alone has surged from \u00a337 billion just before the pandemic to \u00a356 billion now, much more than in any comparable economy, with the bulk of the growth coming from mental health conditions.\n\nLoading Yet Reeves used up almost all her political capital axing the winter fuel allowance to all but the poorest pensioners, a course of action that saves only \u00a31.5 billion a year. This has left her with virtually no space for more serious entitlement reform. In both the US and Britain, cutting state spending back to size is simply not happening on the scale needed to stem the rising tide of debt. Attempts by Musk to draw a line in the sand have ended in acrimony and recrimination. Nobody can tell you exactly when the storm will break, but Musk\u2019s failure brings the final reckoning that much closer. Telegraph, London",

So we now was also another passion that both of us had. So we continued learning and practicing together and performing together for all these years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Gopinath Iyer.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe and his twin brother Ramnath Iyer are orginally from Chenai in India and now call Melbourne home.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe twins each play a traditional plucked string instrument from Southern India known as the Saraswati Veena.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a world where classical music, art and literature compete for attention with 30 second social media videos, the brothers say they feel privileged to receive so much support from people in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nRamnath Iyer explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Indian community in Australia, especially the South Indian community and the Tamal community from Sri Lanka, there's a real connection with the carnatic music because most of them have heard, or they grew up listening to that music and they continue the tradition even here. So the children who are born here also listen to that music. So there is a spiritual connection as well as you identify yourself and your roots with the music.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMillie Ingram has seen a lot of change in her 84 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The changes are happening and I'm so proud of all the young Aboriginal people that are coming up. Years ago you saw very few people, our mob, anywhere in jobs. We had to fight to have back in the 1960s and 70s for them to recogniSe, to start Aboriginal opportunities. And so a lot of young people took advantage of that and didn't come easy. We had to fight for it. A lot of people, a lot of Aboriginal people were fighting for those opportunities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wiradjuri Elder also known as Aunty Millie has been recognised as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the General Division for her significant service to the Indigenous community of New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally from Cowra, Aunty Millie grew up on Erambie Mission before moving to Redfern during the 1950s to find work.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with her family, she set up the first Aboriginal Community Controlled early childhood centre and later the Wyanga Aboriginal Aged Care program.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there was a 13 year stint at the Department of Aboriginal Affairs advocating for empowerment and change in areas such as education and land rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she's grateful to receive the honour this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Last year I was recognised as Elder of the Year for Naidoc and that's by my Aboriginal peers, so that was exciting too. So I'll like accept the award because people are happy to give me an award. I'm happy to take it and I'll take it in good grace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Christine Bigby has received the Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the General Division for her work improving the lives of people with disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is the Director of the Living with Disability Research Centre at La Trobe University in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Bigby has a long history of working in partnership with disability support and advocacy organisations to better the lives of people with intellectual disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince starting in the sector in the early 80s she says a lot has changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The biggest change has been that we've now, in Australia, we've closed all the large institutions that used to house people with intellectual disabilities, and there's many more now, community services for people. People moved out of institutions into small group homes. We built small group homes. And obviously since 2013, there's been the National Disability Insurance Scheme that has opened up more options for people with intellectual disabilities to live in more individualised settings or to make group homes smaller and to support their social inclusion more broadly. So there's been much more investment and attention to people with disabilities over the last 10, 12 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says one of the biggest challenges facing people with an intellectual disability is a shortage of skilled workers to assist people to live their best lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I think we need to introduce some really clear standards for what we expect of disability support workers who are working with people with intellectual disabilities, and we need to introduce some mandatory training and qualifications for this group of people. There are no standard qualifications for support workers. There's no mandatory training at all, and many people come in off the street from other sorts of work and really are ill-equipped to do that work and organisations don't have the capacity to train to a high standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we're serious about supporting social inclusion and engagement of people with intellectual disabilities, then they need really skilled support to do that. And in places like the Netherlands, people do have three year training in social pedagogy to support people with intellectual disabilities to be included in society. It's a really complex skill set of tasks for people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 378 male and 202 female recipients in this years Honours list.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe youngest recipient is 19 years old and the eldest living recipient is 101 years old.\n\n\n\n",

After a hot, dry summer, NSW has faced heavy rain and floods, while Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia have been experiencing drought.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, brothers Kevin and Doug Schlenert had their dairy production facilities and 70 per cent of their herd destroyed in floods on the NSW mid-north coast.\n\n\n\nThe brothers said they didn't know whether they would be able to recover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've got no dairy now to keep going. I don't know which way to turn at the current moment,\" Kevin said, speaking with SBS News in the aftermath of the floods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know if I can bounce back from this. I really don't know.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Dairy Australia's 2025 mid-year Situation and Outlook report, wet weather in the north and dry conditions in the south, in addition to tightened farm margins, have weighed on milk production across several dairying regions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report found a decline in farmer confidence in the future, with only half of respondents in the National Dairy Farmer Survey expressing positive views about the industry's future, compared to two-thirds the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDairy Australia said less than two-thirds of businesses are expecting to make an operating profit, and more than half are anticipating profits will be lower than the previous five-year average.\n\n\n\nBen Bennett, president of the non-profit Australian Dairy Farmers, is concerned about the industry's future. Source: Supplied / Australian Dairy Farmers Ben Bennett, a dairy farmer in south-west Victoria and president of Australian Dairy Farmers, which represents dairy farmers across Australia, said he is extremely concerned about the future of the dairy industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the combination of rising operating costs and weather challenges has put many farmers in an impossible situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're in, quite frankly, a world of pain,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And it's going to get a lot worse too as we enter winter.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meet the Australian farmers Donald Trump has a beef with\n\nBennett said Australian dairy production has decreased by 25 per cent over the past two decades, while dairy imports from overseas have increased.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe believes Australian dairy production will continue to suffer without government assistance and environmental policies designed to support farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would be better for a lot of policies to adhere and listen to local people in that area to maximise environmental opportunity and betterment as opposed to ... people who are somewhat removed from that kind of on-the-ground position,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDairy companies recently announced their farmgate milk prices for the new financial year \u2014 that is, the price paid to farmers per kilogram of milk solids in the raw milk, which is later processed into products.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrices range between $8.60 to $9.20 a kilo, up slightly on last year, but a number of industry groups said farmers were hoping for more.\n\n\n\nAre dairy prices increasing in Australia?\n\nYou may have noticed dairy products are becoming more expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Harvey, senior analyst at Rabobank, which focuses on agribusiness, said there was inflation \"across the dairy aisle\" in 2023 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What consumers would realise is they're paying a lot more for their dairy products from the supermarket than they were two years ago ... milk, butter, cheese, yoghurt, anything you can track,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are at the tail end of a significant price spike for dairy products at a retail level.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the peak of the cycle, Harvey said prices increased by 25 per cent for milk and cheese.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Are supermarkets being unfairly targeted for price gouging?\n\nDairy Australia's report said despite an increase in milk prices, high operating costs will continue to limit profitability for farmers, especially if weather conditions don't improve.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvey said while consumers might be hit with some price increases in the coming months, he does not expect them to be as steep as those recorded in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That was very unique \u2014 it was record-high commodity pricing, it was record-high farm debt pricing, and that's what underpinned the need for companies to pass through high costs to consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It can be a little bit complex, but ultimately it's about the global price of milk that will ultimately set the direction of pricing for dairy products and farm gate milk price.\"\n\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the NSW floods, Eric Danzi, CEO of EastAusmilk, an industry body representing dairy farmers on the Australian eastern seaboard, warned the destruction could have an impact on supermarket shelves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's certainly going to be a real shortage of milk and products \u2014 how that plays through to consumers I don't know,\" he told Sydney radio station 2GB recently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Between the massive floods in NSW now, previous [ex-tropical] Cyclone Alfred, and the drought in Victoria and South Australia, you're going to have a massive reduction in milk production across Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvey said while the current conditions are devastating for farmers, he does not expect them to lead to significant price increases in the short term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s not what\u2019s going to drive the farmgate price higher or commodity prices higher, it\u2019s more global fundamentals that matter,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

Immense. Because we brought together ethnic communities because we didn't create a division with them, but we united them because that was what we had to do.

I can guarantee you that. Football has been our lucky charm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS television launched in 1980.

    "text": "In any case, against total federal spending last year of nearly $US7 trillion, it is but a drop in the ocean, and only goes to show how difficult it is to find serious savings in government administration, even when given a free hand with the headcount. The rampant corruption and incompetence that Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency expected to find in the Washington and wider government machine has turned out to be largely an illusion, and many of the cuts he has managed to make seem to have done more harm than good. This is not to argue that it\u2019s not worth trying, or that you cannot make public services more efficient. But it takes time, substantial upfront investment, and the savings are generally not as big as anticipated. Slowly but surely \u2013 and at varying speeds \u2013 major economies around the world are going bust. Credit: Bloomberg To nobody\u2019s great surprise, it transpires that the skills needed to run a successful business do not transfer easily to the public sector, where the disciplines of the bottom line, the profit motive and competitive markets don\u2019t exist.\n\nLoading The shame of it is that the Musk who built Tesla and SpaceX into two of the world\u2019s most successful companies over a period of nearly two decades has been almost entirely absent while at DOGE these past four or five months. Instead, we have seen a reckless, chainsaw-wielding \u2013 and if the American press is to be believed, drug-fuelled \u2013 Musk who, like his one-time boss Donald Trump, seems to regard government more as performative art than public service. We can all point to myriad examples of public sector waste, of unfathomable spending decisions and stultifying, jobsworth bureaucracy, but the imagined savings from addressing these things nearly always turn out to be a mirage. In Britain, Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK claims there is \u00a37 billion to be saved by scrapping public sector spending on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Sadly, no such saving exists.\n\nRecent government figures showed just \u00a327 million ($56 million) was spent by the civil service on DEI measures during 2022-23. This might well be \u00a327m too much, but it is not going to solve Britain\u2019s debt crisis. The two big cash-burners in advanced economies\u2019 state spending are public sector salaries and welfare, and both desperately need to be addressed if Western democracies are ever to extract themselves from now mountainous debt. Musk has comprehensively failed on the first of these missions, and not surprisingly so. The sort of productivity-improving automation and digitalisation we see widely applied in the private sector to stay competitive is a marathon, not a sprint, and it requires precision in planning and execution. None of these characteristics was on display from the tech bros sent in to tackle the bloated size of the American state. Their approach was one of slash and burn rather than the slow, methodical re-engineering of government needed to achieve sustainable savings and productivity improvement.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump shows little or no appetite for meaningful entitlement reform. OK, some attempt is being made to trim spiralling Medicaid spending, but it\u2019s half-hearted and is really only there as a gesture to appease fiscal hawks among House Republicans. Nobody can tell you exactly when the storm will break, but Musk\u2019s failure brings the final reckoning that much closer. The bottom line is that Trump is as much a creature of fantasy economics as any. He wants both low taxes and high spending, and expects economic growth to make up the difference. It\u2019s the same delusion as Liz Truss, only very much more dangerous in its seeming rejection of fiscal orthodoxies.\n\nUnlike Britain, America is the beating heart of the global financial system, and if US debt markets go belly-up they\u2019ll take everyone else down with them. Back here in Britain, Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, shows similarly little sign of getting to grips with the leviathan of public spending as she puts the finishing touches to next Wednesday\u2019s spending review. Public sector salary costs are rising, not falling, and while ministers talk the talk on welfare reform, their approach to the issue is no more convincing than that of Trump. It\u2019s just a little tinkering around the edges. Simply getting working-age benefits back to their pre-pandemic level would save \u00a349 billion a year \u2013 more than enough to avoid tax rises and fund the desired increase in defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP, Jeremy Hunt, Reeves\u2019 Conservative predecessor as chancellor, points out. Spending on disability benefits alone has surged from \u00a337 billion just before the pandemic to \u00a356 billion now, much more than in any comparable economy, with the bulk of the growth coming from mental health conditions.\n\nLoading Yet Reeves used up almost all her political capital axing the winter fuel allowance to all but the poorest pensioners, a course of action that saves only \u00a31.5 billion a year. This has left her with virtually no space for more serious entitlement reform. In both the US and Britain, cutting state spending back to size is simply not happening on the scale needed to stem the rising tide of debt. Attempts by Musk to draw a line in the sand have ended in acrimony and recrimination. Nobody can tell you exactly when the storm will break, but Musk\u2019s failure brings the final reckoning that much closer. Telegraph, London",

    "text": "Some residents have been visiting the park since they were children and are devastated at the thought of being pushed out.\n\nFive generations of the Hackett family have holidayed at Wooli, and are devastated by council\u2019s decision. Source: Clarence Valley Holiday Parks/Supplied\n\nFive generations of one family are grieving the end of a dearly-held tradition that has been in the family for decades. In just over three weeks, they will be expected to empty their caravans at Wooli Holiday Park and sign them over to the council, who will demolish them to make way for more tourist accommodation.\n\nJodie Hackett and her family are one of 136 holiday van owners across four parks in the NSW Northern Rivers region who were served a termination notice back in March. Clarence Valley Council informed the residents of Brooms Head, Iluka, Minnie Water and Wooli Holidays Parks that they had 110 days to vacate their site as their long-term agreements were being scrapped.\n\nAccording to council, demand from tourists has increased \u201csignificantly\u201d in recent years, which prompted the move to end the agreements with the long term holders.\n\nThat deadline \u2013 June 30 \u2013 is fast approaching, with residents now taking legal action against the termination.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCurrently, each owner pays council $98 a week to have their van on the site. The cost of the vans themselves vary greatly, but can be upwards of $50,000. Residents have been told if they can\u2019t take their homes with them, they can be signed over to council who will demolish them \u2013 but there will be no financial compensation.\n\nSome residents have been staying at the park for decades, and are distressed at the thought of losing their homes. Source: Tony Everingham\n\nFor Jodie, the park holds a deep significance. Her husband's grandparents were the first to purchase a caravan at Wooli, which sparked a long-held tradition that they still enjoy to this day with their own grandchildren.\n\n\"It has just been such a massive part of our lives. It unites all the generations together in the one meeting place,\" she told Yahoo News.\n\nLike other residents at the park, Jodie is seeking clarity from council, who she says have remained tight-lipped about any future plans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"In order to change the use of Crown land under native title, it must be done with the consultation of the Indigenous tribes of that area. They have failed to do that. There was no consultation with the Indigenous people of the Clarence Valley whatsoever. So that's the first law they broke. Second one is, before you can change the usage of Crown land, you must have a plan of management in place. They have none. Zero.\"\n\nShe added that having a plan and communication from council would make the decision \"easier to swallow\".\n\n'Increase in tourists' claim questioned\n\nJodie said that while she can only speak for Wooli, she finds it hard to believe the decision has been made to accommodate an influx of tourists.\n\n\"The vans at the parks are empty most of the time,\" she said. \"If it wasn't for the regulars that come there, there would be nobody in the park. Apart from the Christmas season and maybe one weekend through the year across Easter, that's it. The rest of the year, those towns, especially Wooli, are empty.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe fears removing the regulars from the park will have a flow-on effect across the town, as the residents help to support the bowling club, local cafes and restaurants and the pub.\n\nFull-time residents will be 'thrown out on the streets'\n\nAlongside those who use the vans for holidays, a number of full-time residents are worried they\u2019ll have nowhere else to go when their agreements expire.\n\nAs casual occupiers, residents are only allowed to use the site for 180 days per year, which means for the other six months they are vacant and cannot be used by anyone else.\n\nBut some owners have made full-time homes in their caravans, adding on permanent, council-approved fixtures like annexes, walls and roofs. It\u2019s a common belief in the community that council are aware of the residents staying beyond their 180-day limit, but have \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d in the past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNow, all of a sudden, they\u2019re getting thrown out on the streets,\u201d Tony Everingham, another holiday site owner, told Yahoo News.\n\nClarence Valley Council cited an increase in tourists as one of the reasons for the decision, but residents say the park sits empty for most of the year. Source: Clarence Coast Holiday Parks\n\nTony has been holidaying at the caravan park for more than four decades, and it\u2019s since become a central fixture for family get-togethers for his kids and grandchildren.\n\nHe\u2019s formed The Clarence Valley Semi Permanent Van Group to unite owners from all four parks who want to fight council\u2019s \u201cheartless\u201d decision.\n\nHe told Yahoo that residents are distressed from council\u2019s \u201ccomplete disregard for the people involved\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe've had a lot of people suffering a lot of stress and a lot of mental anguish over the whole situation,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the mental health and wellbeing of a lot of these people. They\u2019re at their wits end.\u201d\n\nPark residents have lodged close to 100 applications to NCAT (NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal) as they\u2019ve been left with \u201cno other choice\u201d, Tony said.\n\nWhile the deadline looms little more than three weeks away, he\u2019s hoping the legal battle will buy more time for his community. In the meantime, they\u2019re \u201cin limbo\u201d.\n\nWhat Tony and the other van owners are asking for:\n\nThat termination notices be withdrawn\n\nThat existing agreements remain in place until plans of management are implemented\n\nTo be involved in consultation with any compliance issues (like adhering to the 180 days per year rule)\n\nMore time for residents to plan their next move\n\nIf the fight is lost, Tony, Jodie and other caravan owners will have no choice but to sign their homes over to council to be demolished. Source: Clarence Coast Holiday Homes\n\nIf their appeal fails, Tony said he will have no choice but to dump his van, the site of four generations worth of memories. Like many older vans in the park, it can\u2019t be towed or relocated due to age and modifications \u2013 many of which were required by council.\n\nHe said the \u201chappy\u201d community who come together every year at Christmas and New Years will be \u201ctaken away\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd most of these people will never come back. I think it\u2019ll be too distressing for them ever to return\u2026 I think it\u2019ll just tear them apart and they\u2019ll just want to try and walk away and somehow get over this experience.\u201d\n\nAt a council meeting on Thursday, Deputy Mayor Greg Clancy fought for the residents, saying the time frame was simply unfair.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been decades of non-compliance which has been overlooked, and suddenly it has to all be complying by the end of June. This is not a good decision,\u201d he said.\n\nYahoo News has contacted Clarence Valley Council for comment.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "They're widely used in Australia, and help one section of the population in a very big way. But how many of us realise?\n\nBraille trails, seen here in Brisbane, are also known as tactile ground surface indicators (TGSIs), and they serve a very important purpose. Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nWhether it's on city streets, in shopping precincts or train stations, millions around the country walk beside them every day. But how many of us actually know what the trails of bumps and bars on the ground are really for?\n\nThe City of Brisbane Council issued an important reminder recently, prompting many residents to reveal they had no idea. The council explained that, like in many densely populated cities, the raised markings used on the pavers of areas like Queen Street Mall are part of a braille trail, there to assist people with impaired vision to move about safely.\n\nAlso known as tactile ground surface indicators (TGSIs), these markings are the long, raised strips or dot patterns installed in public areas that often span many metres through busy thoroughfares.\n\nThe City of Brisbane Council is reminding people not to obstruct these markings, as they help people with impaired vision to get around safely. Source: City of Brisbane\n\nHow do braille trails, or TGSIs, help vision-impaired people?\n\nThey're designed to be felt underfoot or with a cane and are typically located in high-traffic or hazard-prone areas. For many, they act as an essential substitute for visual information, allowing for greater independence, confidence, and safety when navigating public spaces.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Don't stand, walk or place items of braille trails,\" the City said online. \"Keep them clear to help others.\"\n\nMany responding after seeing the post admitted that they didn't realise the markings' important purpose. \"I had no idea what these were. I honestly thought it was flooring design or something. What a great idea,\" one woman said.\n\n\"I doubt most people know the purpose of these. Good post,\" echoed a second. \"I never knew \u2014 now that I know, I will be conscious not to be in the way,\" wrote a third local.\n\nIn Australia, TGSIs began to be more widely implemented from the late 1990s, following the introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.\n\nNational standards were later developed to guide their use, with tactile indicators now required in most new public infrastructure and major upgrades. Their presence has since become a quiet but critical part of inclusive urban design \u2014 often unnoticed by many, but life-changing for those who rely on them.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
