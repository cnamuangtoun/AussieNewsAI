    "text": "Exclusive: A nurse aged in her 60s who wanted to retire soon is one of thousands missing money after two Australian superannuation funds collapsed.\n\nVictoria nurse Lisa Rogers, 63, transferred half of her retirement fund across to First Guardian Master Fund and Shield Master Fund in 2023, hoping she could maximise her superannuation.\n\nIt turned out to be a costly decision.\n\nLisa Rogers is a nurse from regional Victoria and wanted to retire within the next two years. (Supplied)\n\nAlong with 12,000 other Australians who have lost a combined $1.2 billion, Rogers' nest egg has been frozen and drained with no answers.\n\nRogers told 9news.com.au she feels like her future has been stolen.\n\n\"I've been nursing for over 30 years and it's hard, It's really hard,\" Rogers said.\n\n\"And you don't get many nurses that can keep going past the retirement age.\n\n\"I didn't have much superannuation and was trying to increase my returns on my superannuation before retiring.\"\n\nRogers had $42,000 invested in Shield Master Fund and nearly $20,000 in First Guardian, with the rest in a separate fund which is still accessible.\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nHer Shield investment is frozen and the First Guardian balance is now zero due to the ASIC investigation into both collapsed funds.\n\nRogers' plan was to retire within the next two years.\n\nShe is now looking at working for another six years to recoup even some of her losses.\n\n\"I don't know how I'm going to fund my retirement because I'm already 63,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm going to be a lot worse off and it's scary.\"\n\nRogers said she also supports her adult son with a disability and her missing super will impact his life too.\n\n\"There are people who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is awful,\" she said.\n\n\"But it's my money, it's still my money.\"\n\nRogers transferred half her super into both funds in 2023. (Supplied)\n\nUntangling the collapse of two super funds\ufeff\n\nRogers said she was convinced to move her superannuation across by a financial planner associated with Financial Services Group Australia (FSGA).\n\nASIC permanently cancelled the Australian Financial Services (AFS) license of FSGA on June 7 this year.\n\nASIC said representatives of FSGA provided \"personal financial product advice\" to people who invested in First Guardian.\n\nFerras Merhi was the sole director of FSGA from 10 February 2021 to 30 May 2025.\n\nASIC is investigating Merhi and various entities associated with him, in connection with its investigations concerning Shield and First Guardian. Nine.com.au is not suggesting any wrongdoing by Mehri, only that investigations are ongoing.\n\nKeystone Asset Management Ltd is the responsible entity of Shield Master Fund and is now also in liquidation.\n\nASIC also began investigating First Guardian's responsible entity Falcon Capital, First Guardian and director David Anderson in late 2024.\n\nAround 12,000 people have lost a combined $1.2 billion in super. (iStock)\n\nThe Federal Court made interim travel restraint orders against Falcon Capital Limited directors David Anderson and Simon Selimaj on July 2. No findings of wrongdoing have been made in relation to the directors.\n\nIn a statement, ASIC said it has had more than 40 court appearances on matters related to First Guardian and Shield.\n\nASIC has also told investors that they cannot withdraw or transfer their investments as \"all redemptions are frozen due to the liquidation so that the overall financial position of the fund and recoverability of the fund's investments can be assessed by the liquidators\".\n\n\"Whether any money is returned depends on available assets, court outcomes and the results of liquidation and recovery proceedings,\" ASIC said.\n\nRogers calculated she will need to keep working for at least six more years. (Supplied)\n\nVictims could wait years for their money\n\nRogers has lodged a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).\n\nShe and other complainants have been told it could take years for anything to be resolved.\n\nHowever the liquidators of Shield Master told victims they may eventually receive 22c to 50c from every dollar invested.\n\n\"I am a little bit hopeful, but cautiously, I guess,\" Rogers added.\n\nShe and thousands of other financial victims want answers and change, including stricter regulation of the superannuation industry.\n\n\"The layperson like myself thought that this is the safest way of accumulating some money for retirement,\" Rogers explained.\n\n\"You're under the impression that it's heavily regulated by the government and that this sort of thing cannot occur.\"\n\nRoger said she may have to lean heavily on the pension to fund her retirement if she doesn't claw back her missing $60,000.\n\nShe also suspects thousands more victims will need the pension now too.\n\n\"Then that increases the burden on the government,\" Rogers said. \"You'd think they would want to do something to eliminate that.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino told 9news.com.au the federal government was concerned for investors.\n\n\"The government is committed to ensuring that investor interests are safeguarded and the regulatory framework governing the investment landscape is fit for purpose,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\n\"ASIC has taken steps to commence enforcement and protect investors, including freezing assets and cancelling financial licences where appropriate.\n\n\"As these matters are before the Federal Court and part of ongoing investigations by ASIC and the liquidators, it would be inappropriate to provide further comments or speculation.\"",

They've all worked at McDonald's. (Instagram/Nikki Short/Max Mason-Hubers)\n\nNew research commissioned by the restaurant chain itself claims almost 90 per cent of recruiters agree working under the golden arches sets Aussie up for success.\n\nAnother 80 per cent said skills workers learn on the job\ufeff \u2013 like teamwork, communication, and customer service \u2013 are transferable to any workplace.\n\nWe asked recruiters not associated with the Macca's survey if they agreed that experience in the service industry is a key indicator.\n\nChief executive Asia Pacific of Hays, Matthew Dickason, told 9news that data and direct experience from Hays staff supports Macca's claims.\n\n\"Our head of delivery's daughter has worked at McDonald's for four years, and the resilience she's developed dealing with the public has been remarkable,\" he told 9news.\n\n\"When you can handle a frustrated adult berating you over a broken ice cream machine at 15 years old, you develop exceptional emotional intelligence and professional composure that translates directly to client-facing roles and navigating modern work environments.\"\n\nThe 10 most in-demand jobs for 2025 View Gallery\n\nThe Hays Skills Report shows that 50 per cent of Australian employers now plan to hire people with entirely new skill sets and 92 per cent are focused on upskilling staff.\n\nThat shift, in response to ongoing skills shortages, means \ufefftransferrable skills picked up on the job at Macca's may be more attractive than ever.\n\n\"The key insight for employers is not to dismiss any service industry experience,\" Dickason said.\n\nSenior director at Robert Walters Melbourne Rose Guise agreed that employers in almost every sector want to hire candidates who can handle pressure, meet deadlines, and work effectively in a team.\n\n\"And those are exactly the qualities that McDonald's employees develop,\" she told 9news.\n\nWhile recruiters at Robert Walters \"don't specifically seek out candidates\" with Macca's experience, Guise confirmed it's looked upon favourably even when compared to other fast food jobs.\n\n\"McDonald's has one of the strongest reputations due to its global consistency and structured training model,\" Guise said.\n\n\"Other places like KFC, Domino's, or Subway still reflect well, but they don't always carry the same instant credibility.\"\n\nExperience at Macca's may even be looked at more favourably than other fast food chains. (Supplied)\n\nAssociate director at Robert Half, Emma Sestic, said how useful having Macca's experience on your CV is will also depend on the role and industry you're applying for.\n\nIt can be great for \ufeffentry-level roles in business support and customer service but not all employers view it as directly relevant.\n\n\"In more technical or specialised fields like finance or IT, employers mostly prioritise industry-specific experience over general soft skills,\" she told 9news .\n\n\"Still, it can show strong work ethic and adaptability.\ufeff\"\n\nSo while there are some caveats, it looks like working at McDonald's \ufeffreally can set Australians up for great careers.\n\nThat may \ufeffcome as no surprise to the millions of Aussies who have worked at Macca's.\ufeff\n\nMore than nine in 10 alumni surveyed by McDonald's \ufeffbelieve working there sets people up for success.\n\nEight in 10 parents also \ufeffbelieve it's a great place to have your first job.\n\nBrad McMullen started working at a Macca's restaurant on the NSW central coast when he was just 15 and is still with the company years later, now as McDonald's Australia chief restaurant officer.\n\n\"The training I got from that first time in the restaurant, all those sorts of fundamental skills, they set you up for business,\" he told 9news.\n\nBrad McMullen started at Macca's at 15 and is now McDonald's Australia Chief Restaurant Officer. (Supplied)\n\nMcMullen even attended Hamburger University, which he confirmed is a real thing.\n\nAvailable in eight countries around the world, Hamburger University is where prospective McDonald's restaurant managers receive their training.\ufeff\n\nIt's just one of the employee training avenues McDonald's spends more than $60 million \ufeffon every year.\n\n\"We take our responsibility as one of the biggest employers of young people in Australia really seriously, and we're really proud of that,\" McMullen said.\n\nMore than 100,000 Aussies currently work at McDonalds, from teenagers starting their first job to former corporate workers in their 60s who want something different before they retire.\n\nToday McDonalds has launched a new campaign titled '1 in 12' celebrating the 1.6 million Aussies who have worked under the golden arches since it opened Down Under in 1971.",

    "text": "Kirby and the Forgotten Land was already an incredible game.\n\nIt is a charming and gorgeous showcase of level design, complementing unique and varied power ups.\n\nIt didn't need an expansion, but the fact it's getting one in the form of a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is all the more reason to dive back in or give this wonderful 3D platformer a go for the very first time.\n\nREAD MORE: New Call of Duty game revealed \ufeff\n\nKirby and the Forgotten Land. (Nine)\n\nStar Crossed World\n\nKirby and the Forgotten Land 's expansion is called Star Crossed World .\n\nAfter besting the base game's first boss, an ominous meteor crashes into the ocean. Its arrival triggers dramatic transformations of 12 of the game's levels, which you must conquer to quell the threat.\n\nThere are two of these \"Starry Stages\" to find in each of the six worlds. If you're starting from scratch, they'll unlock incrementally. But if you're booting up a completed save file like I did, all 12 are available from the get go.\n\nCalling these stages a \"remix\" of their existing counterparts would be underselling it.\n\nParting the seas like Moses to explore the ocean floor. (Nine)\n\nParting the seas like Moses to explore the ocean floor is hardly comparable to a level that once limited you to paddling on the surface.\n\nThese are all new levels with all new power ups and tougher enemies to fight.\n\nSpring, Roll and Slide!\n\nTransformations are what makes Kirby, Kirby!\n\n\"Mouthful mode\" set the stage for so many unique challenges in Forgotten Land , as Kirby inhaled and transfigured himself into cars, gliders, unstoppable rollers and a cone that could shatter rock with its point.\n\nMany of these return in the Starry Stages with three new additions:\n\n\"Mouthful mode\" set the stage for so many unique challenges in Forgotten Land. (Supplied)\n\nSpring mouth\n\nGear mouth\n\nSign mouth\n\nDespite its ridiculous name, sign mouth was by far my favourite.\n\nBy inhaling a foldable sign, Kirby would transform himself into a sled to slide down hills at speed, barreling through enemies and unlocking faster routes with precise jumps.\n\nInhaling a gear would allow Kirby to roll up walls at a decidedly slower pace. Leaping from surface to surface can be a little tricky, and you'll need it to find some devilishly hidden collectibles tucked around corners.\n\nTransforming into a spring has never been a mechanic I liked. I didn't like the power up in the Super Mario Galaxy games and the snake transformation was my least favourite of the bunch in Donkey Kong Bananza . To Kirby's credit, his spring is better than either of those. He still moves fast enough while on the ground and jumping is incredibly responsive.\n\nTaken together, these three new power ups combine to create some of the best levels in all of Forgotten Land .\n\nShort and Sweet\n\nIf you're not a completionist (and you're booting up an old save file to access all of the new stages immediately), you can easily power through Star Crossed World in a day.\n\nCollecting every starry and completing every challenge is decidedly tougher.\n\nCollecting every starry and completing every challenge is tough. (Supplied)\n\nIt took me roughly 10 hours to 100 per cent the Starry Stages and collect all of the 85 new figures.\n\nIf you're particularly sadistic, there's also a new and brutal new boss rush waiting for you at the colosseum. Besting the original colosseum challenge without dying was tough enough. This new challenge feels like something out of a Dark Souls game.\n\nAfter two measly attempts, I could only get through four or the 12 rounds!\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nNintendo is selling Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star Crossed World for $109.95.\n\nYou can find it cheaper in store and if you already own the original, the upgrade pack is $30.\n\n12 stages for $30 is about right when the base game had 32.\n\nIf you're a Kirby fan or a parent with kids, this one's a no brainer.\n\nAnd if you're looking for something to play on your Switch 2 before Hollow Knight: Silksong comes out next week, this Switch 2 Edition is arguably the best yet.",

    "text": "Venus Williams insists she is not a good doubles player. The 14 major championships she and Serena won together tell a different story.\n\nWithout her younger sister by her side, Williams showed she has still got it. Williams won a women's doubles match at the US Open for the first time in more than a decade, teaming with Leylah Fernandez to defeat the sixth-seeded pair of Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.\n\nWhen it was over, the 45-year-old Williams did her signature twirl-and-wave and called Fernandez \"the best partner I ever played with \u2014 outside of Serena\".\n\nThe 22-year-old Canadian even reminded Venus of Serena.\n\n\"Our energy really matched each other in terms of determination, in terms of not giving up, in terms of really still just focused and dialled in in every single thing,\" Williams said.\n\n\"That felt amazing because I never really played with a partner \u2014 outside of Serena, obviously \u2014 who had that kind of mentality, so it was really fun.\"\n\nWilliams and Fernandez, the 2021 singles runner-up at Flushing Meadows, were heavy fan favourites at a nearly full Louis Armstrong Stadium, and the chair umpire had to ask the crowd multiple times to quiet down.\n\nThe spectators gave Williams and Fernandez a standing ovation after they claimed the opening tie breaker despite trailing 5-2 in that set \u2014 and rose again to cheer after the match ended in 90 minutes.\n\n\"Leylah is a good player, (and) Venus is also a good doubles player,\" Kichenok said.\n\n\" They have played doubles many times. They know what it is. Maybe it took a bit of time to adjust at the beginning, but then they found their rhythm. \"\n\nThroughout the match, there were chants of \"Here we go, Venus, here we go!\" and a sign in the stands read, \"Welcome to the Williams show.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Williams said in her on-court interview. \"Thank you, you guys. Thank you for showing up for us.\"\n\nWilliams had not won a women's doubles match in New York since 2014, when she and Serena made it to the quarterfinals, or at any Grand Slam tournament since the 2018 French Open.\n\n\"It's an area that I'm not that comfortable in, being on a doubles court, but I think you get to some point in the match where you stop thinking about it,\" Williams said.\n\n\" When push comes to shove, I'll do what I have to, but I'm a singles player, so, of course, when I walk out there, I actually tell myself just to play singles and try that method. I try not to be something that I'm not. \"\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport? Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\nThe older Williams won seven Grand Slam titles in singles and another two in mixed doubles. She had been off the tour for 16 months until returning to action by playing singles and doubles at Washington in July.\n\n\" With the amount of matches I've played, I'm progressing very quickly,\" Williams said. \"I didn't have to come back to play tennis, but eventually I found my way back. \"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAt Flushing Meadows, Williams lost in the first round of mixed doubles and singles, then was awarded a wild card for women's doubles. Fernandez described feeling \"like a kid on Christmas Day\" and jumping around with a smile on her face after getting the call that Williams wanted to play doubles with her.\n\nShe was shocked to hear the comparison to Serena.\n\n\" It's probably the biggest compliment I've ever gotten,\" Fernandez said. \"I feel like those are big shoes to fill. \"\n\nBack in doubles at the US Open for the first time since 2022, Williams gets to keep going in New York after pushing 11th-seeded Karolina Muchova to three sets before bowing out of singles play Monday night.\n\nUlrikke Eikeri and Eri Hozumi are up next in the second round of doubles.\n\n\" I actually feel great,\" Williams said. \"With some luck, we'll stay, maybe win another round and just keep getting better. \"\n\nAP",

    "text": "Taylor Swift has built a billion-dollar empire off the back of relatable lyrics, taking her decades of experience with romance and heartbreak to craft love songs and break-up ballads.\n\nNow, she's getting married.\n\nSwift announced her engagement to NFL player Travis Kelce on Instagram this week, sharing photos of the proposal in a post that has garnered more than 33 million likes.\n\nThe pair began dating two years ago after Kelce revealed his desire to pursue the global superstar on his football podcast before trying to meet Swift backstage at the Eras Tour.\n\nHe was swiftly denied entry, but the risk was worth the reward.\n\nTaylor Swift said previously that Travis Kelce's courtship \"is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager\". (Instagram: @taylorswift)\n\n\"It was such a wild, romantic gesture to just be like 'I want to date you,'\" Swift said during an interview on Kelce's podcast earlier this month, which has amassed more than 21 million views on YouTube.\n\n\"It kind of felt more like I was in an 80s John Hughes movie, and he was standing outside of my window with a boom box just being like, 'I want to date you. Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship bracelet!'\n\n\" It's like, if this guy isn't crazy \u2014 which is a big if \u2014 this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager. \"\n\nNow that Swift is entering her bridal era, is this the end of her vast swathes of relatable heartbreak songs that have sound-tracked the lives of her fans?\n\nBaby, just say 'yes'\n\nSwift's relationships have always played a significant role in her music, from her earliest album to her latest releases.\n\n\"She's taken her fans on her journey from being a young teenager with crushes and experiencing first heartbreaks, through to the more complex experiences of looking for, finding, and losing love in your twenties and thirties,\" says Georgia Carroll, a fan culture researcher.\n\nFan culture expert Georgia Carroll says themes of marriage aren't new to Taylor Swift's music. (Instagram: @taylorswift)\n\nBut Dr Carroll says while Swift's relationships have been a key theme of her music, they're far from being the only theme.\n\n\"When they are a part of the stories she tells, they are also the story of her maturity and growth through life on a broader scale.\n\n\"So while her break-up songs are definitely part of the reason fans relate to her, Taylor has built her career and image on being more than just relatable for her relationships and their endings.\"\n\nHow Taylor Swift's financial status collides with fans Photo shows Taylor Swift leans back and closes her eyes on stage in an orange dress as lights blur around her Taylor Swift is officially a billionaire, with Forbes confirming the megastar is the first artist to reach the wealthy status solely from songwriting and performing\n\nAnd as Dr Carroll adds, themes of love and marriage aren't new parts of her music.\n\n\"Love Story features an engagement, Paper Rings is all about wanting to get married, and fans have famously used Lover as the first dance song at their weddings from the moment of its release,\" she says.\n\n\"Even though this is the first time she's actually engaged, her music has always featured a belief in happily ever after and that she would one day find it.\"\n\nA new era\n\nAccording to Lauren Rosewarne, an associate professor at the University of Melbourne, Swift's relatable persona is impressive considering her net worth.\n\n\"Taylor Swift does vulnerability and confession well,\" Dr Rosewarne says.\n\n\"That she's perceived to divulge a lot about herself, her relationships and fears and anxieties endears her to fans, many of whom have grown up alongside her for nearly two decades.\n\n\"Taylor Swift has also managed to appear authentic and also accessible to her fans, which is an enormously difficult thing to accomplish when you're literally a billionaire superstar.\"\n\nTaylor Swift showed off her engagement ring as part of a series of posts on Instagram. (Instagram: @taylorswift)\n\nSo will Swift's engagement have any impact on how fans relate to her?\n\n\"Ultimately this is to be determined,\" Dr Rosewarne says.\n\n\"I imagine that there are many fans who actually just want her happy and thus will enjoy her future creative endeavours, regardless of what they entail.\n\n\"For others, there might be more of an investment in the drama, so marriage and stability might make her life and music seem less interesting.\"\n\nAs Dr Carroll notes, many Swifties are also likely to be engaged or married themselves.\n\n\"Rather than making her less relatable, it's going to unlock a new layer of relatability,\" she says.\n\n\"Many fans on social media have already been saying that seeing Taylor find true love in her mid-30s gives them hope as they find themselves similarly single and looking for their Mr Right \u2014 and I'm also in that camp!\n\n\"And just because we won't be getting a break-up album about this relationship, it doesn't mean she doesn't have other angst to draw on.\n\nTaylor Swift: Showgirl and 'marketing mastermind' Photo shows Taylor Swift poses in a body of water in a glittering silver corset Taylor Swift's new album might be called The Life of a Showgirl, but her ability to whip her fans into a frenzy ahead of the announcement has one expert calling her a \"marketing mastermind\".\n\n\"We have 11 albums \u2014 and potentially soon-to-be 12 \u2014 that touch on heartbreak, and they aren't going anywhere.\"\n\nSince Swift's upcoming album, The Life of a Showgirl, was produced before the proposal, the earliest hints of this new era in her songwriting would come via her 13th album.\n\n\"It's hard to know how much of the process she'll share with us through her music, but also how different it will potentially be from her previous examinations of love and the thought of forever,\" Dr Carroll says.\n\n\"Albums like Folklore and Evermore have shown she's not afraid to experiment with fictional narratives in her music, so we could also see a return to a less autobiographical style of music should she wish to keep this next stage of her relationship more private.\"",

    "text": "Defending US Open champion Jannik Sinner has effortlessly brushed aside Australian Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 to make the third round of the Grand Slam and send out an ominous warning to his title rivals in New York.\n\nThe metronomic world number one, looking to become the first man to retain the trophy at Flushing Meadows since Roger Federer won the last of his five crowns in 2008, was expected to face a tricky test against a tenacious opponent on Thursday, local time.\n\n\"Obviously, I try to play the best tennis I can,\" said Sinner, who plays Canadian 27th seed Denis Shapovalov in the next round.\n\n\"The first round matches are always different compared to the further you go (in the tournament). I'm very happy that I managed these matches as good as I could, when you are up two sets and a break, you try to serve as best as you can.\n\n\"Today it felt like neither of us served well, but I was returning well, especially on the second serve. I'm happy about today. I'm aiming to improve on the serve but the rest (of my game), I'm quite comfortable with.\"\n\nBut Popyrin, who arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium hoping to knock out the holder for a second successive year after toppling Novak Djokovic 12 months ago, landed in a world of trouble early on when Sinner forged a 4-1 lead with a reflexive return.\n\nSinner wrapped up the opening set on serve and then had the bandages on his right foot trimmed by a physio during the break, before the 24-year-old promptly resumed his mission to scythe down his 36th-ranked opponent in the second set.\n\nThe top seed forced an error from Popyrin's racquet for an early break, and although he faced some resistance while serving in the sixth game, comfortably took the second frame by trading his powerful hitting for a soft drop at the net on set point.\n\nPopyrin's win over Sinner in their only previous meeting at the 2021 Madrid Open began to look increasingly irrelevant when he fell behind in the third, before his opponent put him out of his misery with a thunderous ace.\n\nThe usually understated Sinner, who is aiming to go level on five Grand Slam trophies with his charismatic title rival Carlos Alcaraz, will now have a day to recover and said he had a number of Italian restaurants in mind to indulge his appetite.\n\nThere are more Australians due in action on day five, with Maya Joint facing American Amanda Anasimova on Louis Armstrong Stadium in the night session.\n\nOn Stadium 17, Daria Kasatkina will take on Kamilla Rakhimova, followed by Alex de Minaur playing Japan's Shintaro Mochizuki on the same court.\n\nReuters/ABC",

(Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\n\"When you see your son run onto the football field and within five minutes he's on the stretcher being carried off shaking and convulsing, it's pretty upsetting,\" Mr Brown said.\n\n\" But that's the game. \"\n\nHe said they asked Hunter to consider hanging up his boots but \"it was always 'just one more year'\".\n\nMrs Brown said her son figured it was too late for him and he may as well keep playing.\n\nJoanne and Rod Brown hope Hunter's brain donation will help other players by advancing CTE research. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)\n\nThe ASBB, which examined Hunter's brain, said CTE risk was more closely linked to how long someone had played a contact sport, rather than the number of concussions they sustained.\n\n\"We just hope that something can come out of the [brain] donations ... [and] it can help young players in the future to find a cure before it kills them,\" Mrs Brown said.\n\nInquiries into the circumstances surrounding Hunter's death are ongoing, but preliminary coronial findings indicate he died from methylamphetamine-related heart failure.\n\nDo you have a story you want to share with the ABC? Contact Bridget McArthur at bridgetmcarthurtips@proton.me. If you're sharing sensitive information, read our tips on how to contact us confidentially.\n\nCTE symptoms and subtypes\n\nAn examination of Hunter's brain revealed several lesions consistent with stage II CTE, classed as low stage.\n\nASBB founder and associate professor Michael Buckland said symptoms included anxiety, depression, rage and poor impulse control.\n\n\"Many families tell us that their loved one sought some relief through drugs or alcohol,\" he said.\n\nThe examination also identified potential evidence of cortical-sparing CTE, classed as high stage.\n\nMichael Buckland founded the Australian Sports Brain Bank, which researches CTE in sportspeople. (ABC News: Jak Rowland)\n\nAccording to the ASBB, people with cortical-sparing CTE are less likely to experience dementia and severe cognitive difficulties but more likely to have early-onset behavioural and movement issues, compared to people with typical high-stage CTE.\n\nDr Buckland, a senior pathologist, said the subtype had only recently been discovered.\n\n\"We don't know a lot about it yet but it does appear to occur in about 10 per cent of cases,\" he said.\n\n\"It seems that in those cases people have more mental-health-type issues rather than the thinking and planning issues.\"\n\nDr Buckland said it was not yet clear why it only presented in a minority of people.\n\nHopes for living diagnosis\n\nIt is still relatively early days for CTE research.\n\nThe ASBB was the first medical institute to identify the disease in an AFL player's brain.\n\nIt has so far analysed about 100 sportspeople's brains, finding CTE in over 40 of them \u2014 professionals and amateurs.\n\nDr Buckland said brain donations were essential to better understanding the disease.\n\nHe said a global effort was underway to identify biomarkers of CTE and living diagnosis could be possible in the next decade or two, although a cure was likely some time away.\n\nBoth professionals and amateurs are at risk of developing CTE in high-contact sports. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)\n\n\"It's important for people not to give up,\" he said.\n\n\" There's no cure but the symptoms can be treated ... there's always cause for hope. \"\n\nIn the meantime, Dr Buckland said it was \"pleasing\" to see the AFL and other sporting bodies start to take concussion and head knocks more seriously.\n\nBut he said the risk could be further minimised by limiting full-contact training and leveraging new technologies like smart mouthguards to track players' exposure.\n\n'Dozens of rules' introduced\n\nAn AFL spokesperson said the league had changed \"dozens of rules\" to reduce the amount of \"avoidable forceful high contact\".\n\n\"Independent doctors \u2026 have more direct authority in relation to head injury assessments and being able to direct that a player be taken from the field for assessment,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe AFL has committed $25 million over 10 years to research the game's impact on brain health \"to inform policies at all levels of the game\".\n\nIt recently launched a new injury support fund for past players in collaboration with the AFL Players Association.\n\nThe association said it encouraged past players to commit their brains for research.\n\nThe West Coast Eagles deferred to the AFL's comments.\n\nThe Australian Sports Brain Bank is currently looking for Australians who have played high-impact contact sports to donate their brain for research.

Down the bottom of this post there's a link to what the world is doing.\n\nHere's Sims:\n\n\"Why am I talking about a price on carbon? Do I not know that this and other potential governments will never implement a price on carbon? Let\u2019s put our emission reduction efforts elsewhere where we can make progress.\n\n\"This is defeatist and damaging thinking.\n\n\"We all know a carbon price is first-best policy, but that statement gets us nowhere.\n\n\"The following arguments are why a carbon price is necessary and urgent.\n\n\"First, our current policies will not allow us to meet our climate targets and obligations unless further piecemeal, contentious and hideously costly steps are taken along these same paths.\n\n\"Second, current and likely future similar policies will damage our productivity.\n\n\"Third, policies without a carbon price provide no funds to compensate households for the cost of these policies.\n\n\"Fourth, current and likely future policies damage rather than contribute to necessary budget repair.\n\n\"How many times have we heard companies say they would like to make or use more green products, but they cannot, as they are more expensive?\n\n\"Well, of course, they are. Green and black products compete without any allowance for the damage done to the environment from the use of fossil fuels. If green products were already competitive with black products, there would be no need to encourage a transition; it would simply happen.\n\n\"Some criticise companies which make such statements, but they should not. The fault lies with government. If a government proclaims that the use of fossil fuels damages the environment but then does not recognise this in the way advocated by economists for over 100 years, via carbon pricing, you cannot blame companies for not taking action that would harm their economic interests.\"",

    "text": "With the Panthers resting nearly their entire top 17 for Thursday's clash with the Bulldogs, it was always going to bring forth a few new faces who came with a bit of a story behind them.\n\nOne of the five debutants was centre Sione Fonua, who was playing park footy for Brothers Penrith this time last year after several years away from the game.\n\nAnother was backrower Zac Lipowicz, who works as a sparky when he's not playing footy, only gets to train part-time, and has represented Poland in international football.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch, but all things considered, it would be hard to be too critical of the Penrith cub's efforts.\n\nThis, after all, was the most inexperienced team in NRL history in terms of cumulative games, and they showed plenty of spirit despite going down 28-4 to Canterbury.\n\nTheir emergence was part of the long game for the Panthers. In holding back nearly their entire top side, they're throwing their weight around without moving a muscle.\n\nOnly two of the 117 teams that have won premierships in Australia have won from outside the top four, and now that the Panthers can finish no higher than sixth, they're aiming to make it three.\n\nIn his pre-match press conference, coach Ivan Cleary mentioned how the rise from the bottom of the ladder near the midpoint of the season had taken its toll, which is a marker of how things have changed for his side.\n\nThey have found peace in being at war forever, and are no stranger to a final round mass resting, but that was when they were top of the ladder, or close to it.\n\nPenrith rested 16 of its top 17 for the match, confirming it will miss the top four. (AAP Photos: Mark Evans )\n\nThis time, the resting, two rounds out from the finals, was both a statement of intent that they're going for something that is incredibly difficult, and a concession of the size of the task ahead because recent history says just making it to the grand final from outside the four will take something heroic.\n\nEight sides have made the grand final from outside the top four in the NRL era \u2014 including Cleary's New Zealand Warriors side in 2011 \u2014 but it hasn't happened since 2017.\n\nWhat shapes in Penrith's favour is that the last team that walked in the unfamiliar country they're seeking, fit a similar profile to the four-time defending premiers.\n\nThe 1995 Bulldogs won it all after finishing sixth in the regular season, joining the 1993 Broncos \u2014 which finished fifth but were just one win off the minor premiership \u2014 in a very exclusive club.\n\nBoth these Panthers and those Bulldogs entered the year among the premiership favourites, and both played their seasons out of Parramatta rather than their traditional homes.\n\nNRL live: Canterbury Bulldogs vs Penrith Panthers Photo shows Lachlan Galvin of the Bulldogs scores a try, grounding the ball in the corner while being tackled A hat-trick to backrow forward Jacob Preston has guided the Canterbury Bulldogs to a 28-4 win over an understrength Penrith Panthers. Follow live.\n\nWhile Penrith has had to claw its way up from higher depths after it was in last place after an awful first half of the year, Canterbury was dealing with a more existential crisis.\n\nThe advent of the Super League war cast a pall over the whole sport, but Canterbury, which chose to link with the breakaway competition, had to reckon with four of its best players \u2014 Jason Smith, Jarrod McCracken, Dean Pay and Jim Dymock \u2014 attempting to backflip on their deals with the rebels.\n\nEventually, they sued the club for the right to head to ARL-aligned Parramatta, and while Smith, Pay and Dymock all went on to play in the grand final side, bad blood bubbled underneath the surface between McCracken and coach Chris Anderson all season.\n\nJust as Penrith regrouped after a dire loss to Newcastle in Bathurst this year, the Bulldogs came together after a 42-0 smashing by the Knights in late June that put them down to 10th on the ladder.\n\nThere was a couple of bonding sessions, which was the style at the time, where some truths were exchanged and honest words told as the beers flowed.\n\nThe details all came up again just last month, when the 1995 Dogs got together for the 30-year reunion of their hard-fought miracle.\n\n\"Only the people at the Bulldogs gave us any chance, but we were building in confidence and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 belief,\" said hooker Jason Hetherington.\n\nThe 1995 Bulldogs held their reunion earlier this year. (Getty Images: Jeremy Ng)\n\n\"We embraced the moments of finals footy and we had an understanding of what was in front of us.\n\n\"It's proof it can be done. The statistics say it's extremely hard to do, but we proved it can.\"\n\nIf Canterbury's run through that finals series happened in a movie, it wouldn't have worked because nobody would find it realistic. It was too good to be true, only it really happened.\n\nAfter beating St George in week one, they downed the third-placed Broncos handily before outlasting the second-placed Raiders, which had only lost two matches all year, in the preliminary final.\n\n\"Our belief heading into the grand final against Manly was so strong, they'd only lost two games all year, but we felt like nobody could beat us,\" Hetherington said.\n\n\"A big part of it goes to the chemistry of what we had. Mateship, backing each other up, helping each other out, that matters.\"\n\nThe 17-4 victory over the Sea Eagles in the decider confirmed Canterbury's place in history and ensured they would send out retiring captain Terry Lamb a winner.\n\nLamb, who Hetherington calls the greatest team man he's ever seen, galvanised the squad through the hard times, but it took mighty efforts from the heralded and unheralded alike to slay all the giants.\n\nTerry Lamb helped hold Canterbury together en route to its 1995 premiership. (Getty Images)\n\n\"I always try and give special mention to Simon Gillies. What he did through the finals series was incredible, and I'd never seen him play like that in my life,\" Hetherington said.\n\n\"He was a good defensive toiler in the forwards, a good player, and a better fella, but he led the way, and we followed him. He was an everyday battler footballer who became outstanding.\n\n\"It takes special efforts like that, everyone following along, everyone playing to their best of their ability. It can be done, but you have to believe it can be done.\"\n\nIf any team has that belief it's Penrith because no side has a greater understanding of what it takes to win at this time of the year.\n\nThat gives them a better foundation to win it from the bottom half of the eight than sides like the Roosters, or Broncos, which, for all their attacking brilliance, may struggle to find the consistency to win the required four sudden-death games in a row.\n\nAt the same time, it's worth remembering Penrith is not chasing its first title as a group, but its fifth.\n\nOver the course of their dynasty they have outlasted fatigue, conventional wisdom over how long a team can stay hungry, and seemingly time itself as they put together the greatest winning run of their time.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nEventually, that has to catch up to them, and what they're doing has to end because not even this team can last forever.\n\nBut this is the same side that has made themselves immortal by finding new things to fight against, and new challenges to conquer, even as they sat on top of the world.\n\nWinning it all again, from here, with the weight of such history against them, strikes as the exact thing that would keep the black fires burning.\n\nBeyond that, it's been an unusual and open season, which could forecast an unusual and opening finish.\n\n\"We all think we know who the good teams are, and some have been good all year, but if you know anything about footy, your tips this season are probably a disaster,\" Hetherington said.\n\nAnd when he talks about the nuts and bolts that drove the Bulldogs, there are echoes of the same elements that have built the Panthers to greatness time and again.\n\n\"What made us successful was our strong defensive efforts for each other, we just kept turning up and turning them away,\" Hetherington said.\n\n\"If teams can get that defensive system and structure for each other, anyone can stand a chance. It's a tall order, it can be done, but you have to believe you can do it.\"",

    "text": "Jess Hull has blown a glorious opportunity to grab Diamond League glory when she ran out of steam with victory in her grasp in the 1,500-metre final in Zurich.\n\nAustralia's Olympic silver medallist looked certain to prevail as she held a 10m lead coming down the home straight in the Letzigrund Stadium on Thursday, local time, but she'd miscalculated her energy reserves and blew up in the last few steps, allowing Kenyan Nelly Chepchirchir to steal the win right on the line.\n\nChepchirchir herself was nearly out on her feet and the leading pair were both almost overhauled by the third-placed Australian, Linden Hall, whose fast finish would surely have taken her to victory in a couple more strides.\n\n\"I saw it, I saw Nelly coming closer, it's okay,\" a resigned Hull said afterwards. \"With the last 100m, I was tired, my legs were very tired because I've had very hard training blocks.\n\n\"I learned today my body is fit, but that I need to keep energy for the last 100m, so the solution is to take a bit out of training.\"\n\nHull slumped to the track exhausted after being beaten by just three-hundredths of a second \u2014 3 minutes and 57.02 seconds to Chepchirchir's season's best 3:56.99.\n\nIf she had won, it would have resulted in an extra fourth place being opened up for Australia in the women's 1,500m in Tokyo.\n\nGeorgia Griffith, who'd earlier finished fourth in the 3,000m final in 8:41.36 behind Ethiopian winner Fantaye Belayneh (8:40.56), may have been the one who would have benefited.\n\nOlyslagers wins another Diamond League Photo shows Nicola Olyslagers clenches her fists and smiles after winning the high jump in front of the Zurich Opera House. Nicola Olyslagers confirms her status as perhaps Australia's greatest gold medal chance at next month's athletics world championships.\n\nAll-time miling great Steve Cram said on the BBC he'd never seen anything like Hull's \"collapse\" in the dying metres once her bold front-running had allowed her to push on for glory with just under 800m left.\n\nFive metres clear at the bell, Hull doubled her advantage \u2014 and more \u2014 down the back straight, but had nothing in reserve as she tried to run the legs out of her Kenyan pursuer.\n\nCram noted: \"She completely misjudged it, the two of them couldn't have gone any slower at the end \u2014 I've never seen that before. Jess completely ran out of gas.\n\n\"You've got to know you've got enough in reserve when you get to 300m, 200m to go. She's got that experience, but with 200 she was still heading for a time of 3:55. I haven't seen anything like that from Jess in a long time.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"In the end, Linden Hall (3:57.44) almost won it \u2014 it was a strange race.\"\n\nIt meant Hull missed out on joining Wednesday's high jump winner Nicola Olyslagers, hurdler Sally Pearson, and two-time pole vault winner Nina Kennedy as Australian women Diamond League champions.\n\nOlympic bronze medallist Matthew Denny missed out his third straight men's discus title, his best effort of 66.62m good enough for only fourth behind Lithuania's Paris silver medallist Mykolas Alekna, who prevailed with 68.89m in the second round.\n\nMackenzie Little also took fourth place in the women's javelin, the World Championship bronze medallist had a best throw of 61.96m, the first time she had thrown over 60m in 2025.\n\nMelbourne's Sarah Billings came home seventh (1:58.76) in a thrilling 800m won by local Swiss heroine Audrey Werro in 1:55.91.\n\nAAP/ABC",

    "text": "Chief financial officer Race Strauss said: \u201cImportantly, all key financial metrics included in the prospectus were met or exceeded.\u201d Virgin is standardising - and making more dense - its seating. The company\u2019s transformation program aims to enhance revenue through more offerings, cutting costs through improved productivity, and driving deeper loyalty to Virgin\u2019s Velocity program. The cost of the IPO and Qatar Airways \u201cwet lease\u201d transaction were $115.9 million. The deal gives Virgin access to Qatar\u2019s international longhaul network, without the cost of maintaining the fleet. The company\u2019s transformation program is expected to generate $400 million in benefits in 2026 and more for the next few years \u201cand beyond\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a high inflationary environment in aviation and so we need to be not just offsetting [the inflation] but getting beyond it,\u201d Emerson said. Seat densification Strauss said: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of the fleet density opportunities, putting the additional aircraft in the fleet, we\u2019re only a little more halfway on that.\u201d Additionally, Virgin Australia Regional Airlines is being simplified and more technology benefits are coming. \u201cThere\u2019s a long pipeline still to come,\u201d Stauss said.\n\nPart of the transformation involves a seat densification program. CEO Virgin Australia Dave Emerson. Credit: Edwina Pickles Emerson said adding more seats to the aircraft \u201creally benefits the customer because... Sometimes today we show up in the plane has a few more or few fewer seats than we had planned and that\u2019s not great for the customer experience.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re setting it up now so each plane is set up with exactly the same configuration and for some of the planes that needs an extra row of seats, but not all of them.\u201d Other revenue streams are strong too. Velocity contributed $450 million, up from $409 million and added 900,000 new members.\n\nLoading \u201cThe Qatar deal has really helped our Velocity program and created a very positive dynamic for customers,\u201d said Emerson, who noted that on a profit and loss basis \u201cit hasn\u2019t really affected us positively or negatively\u201d. Atlas Funds chief investment officer Hugh Dive said Virgin\u2019s results had to be read in parallel with Qantas\u2019 to get a reading of where the company stood. While Virgin had smaller capital expenditure than Qantas which is refreshing its fleet, overall the airlines were tracking in a similar direction. Virgin\u2019s load factor \u2013 a measure of the used seat capacity, or the fullness of a flight \u2013 is at 84.9 per cent compared to Qantas domestic at 78.1 per cent.\n\n\u201cVirgin\u2019s load factor is a lot higher than Qantas domestic \u2013 but both are pretty good,\u201d said Dive. Jetstar domestic meanwhile is at 89.5, which helps explain its contribution to Qantas. Revenue rose as well to $5.8 billion in 2025 from $5.63 billion in 2024, a growth of 3.1 per cent. Virgin made a successful return to the sharemarket in June, valued at $2.3 billion, after selling $685 million worth of stock to fund managers and retail investors at $2.90 a share. Virgin was delisted from the ASX in 2020 amid mounting debts and losses. Having entered administration, it was bought by US-based Bain Capital, the private equity firm Emerson worked for before joining Virgin\u2019s management in 2021.",

    "text": "Loading Although it will take the best athletes more than two hours to finish the race, you shouldn\u2019t be fooled. The best will be running very fast. Crazy fast. The men\u2019s race is expected to be won in around 2 hours and 5 minutes (2:05). To run that time, athletes will have to complete every kilometre in just under three minutes. That works out at 72 seconds for every 400m, or 18 seconds for every 100m. How fast is that? The best way to understand that pace (for mere mortals who know the struggle of a treadmill) is to do this: go to your treadmill and turn the speed up to 20 (km/h). See if you can last 30 seconds. The world\u2019s fastest men\u2019s marathoners can set it to 20 km/hr and run for two hours. The world\u2019s best women do it on 19 km/hr.\n\nRoughly speaking, a three-hour marathon equates to running at 14 km/hr on the treadmill. The course The Sydney Marathon was first opened to the public in 2001 as a way for your average Joes to get a chance to complete the course that the best athletes in the world had run at the 2000 Olympics. It\u2019s changed in the years since, but will still feature some of the original course, including its most appealing features. Highlights will include running across the Harbour Bridge, the gruelling final uphill lap to Mrs Macquarie\u2019s Chair, and a finish in front of the Opera House. The result: this marathon will have the most elevation of any of the majors, a fact which is sure to test even the best, as Hassan herself said on Thursday that she was \u201cnot good at hills\u201d.\n\nHow to watch There are several key spots for spectators to watch the marathon this year. Those who want to see the gun go off at the start line should aim to be at Miller St in North Sydney by 6:15am. Other key viewing areas are Barangaroo (from 6:30am), Martin Place (from 6:40am), Randwick (from 7:30am), and Moore Park (from 7:55am). There will be several fan sites along the course, complete with DJs, face painters, and even Drag Queens watching on when the race passes through Taylor Square. The first runners are expected to cross the finish line from 8:30am, with the last of the finishers expected at around 3:15pm. Workenesh Edesa Gurmesa winning the 2024 race.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size To the untrained eye, Reece Walsh looks like he\u2019s making it up as he goes along. A flick pass here, a goose step there. Maybe a short-side raid or a chip-and-chase, as likely to come out on the first tackle as the last. How can opposition defences know what\u2019s coming because the flying fullback seemingly doesn\u2019t know himself? But this is where the rugby league world has got it all wrong. The greatest dummy Walsh has ever sold is the notion that he\u2019s doing it all off the top of his head. That the audacious plays that make highlight reels when they come off - and give Brisbane coach Michael Maguire a coronary when they don\u2019t - are the result of unscripted, ad-lib football. Nothing is further from the truth. \u201cThe way I play, people think it\u2019s off the cuff and it\u2019s just luck, but the hours spent in the video room, watching teams, watching how they defend, their habits and tendencies, my brain doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cThe way I play, people enjoy watching it, but it\u2019s [about] the things they don\u2019t see; the hours that I put in on the [training] field, even with \u2018Madge\u2019 [Maguire], going over plays, picking his brain about things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very passionate about my footy. I want to try to be the best player I can be and it\u2019s something I pride myself on, working hard and spending those hours on the training paddock when there\u2019s no one around watching.\u201d Sit down with Maguire, and he\u2019ll describe Walsh as a student of the game. Whether it\u2019s spending countless hours on the training track or forever studying video footage off it, the fullback\u2019s workday is longer than most. It prompts the question; is the most flashy, flamboyant star in the game a footy nerd? \u201cYou tell me,\u201d Walsh laughs. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching every single game every week, watching my games back, is that a footy nerd? Reece Walsh leaves defenders in his wake. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI don\u2019t really think that\u2019s being a footy nerd, that just comes with it. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not a one mould fits all. It\u2019s just what I enjoy doing, trying to be the best I can for myself. \u201cIf that\u2019s watching a bit more video, working on a few more things. I\u2019m not the only guy who does it. There\u2019s a lot of guys in our squad that work extremely hard on their craft to be the best.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe greatest fullback of the modern era, Billy Slater, was given simple riding instructions from Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy. Slater was given the freedom to express himself however he liked on the football field, but only if he first perfected the play at training. It\u2019s a similar relationship between Walsh and Maguire. \u201c100 per cent. If I haven\u2019t got something right, if I haven\u2019t trained it, that\u2019s when he is disappointed,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cHe does say a lot about putting those hours and extras in. Even after our trainings are done, we practice things and it comes out in the games. \u201cThe time spent practising stuff, you might not get it within the first 10 goes or whatever it is, but when you do things right that you\u2019ve practiced, it\u2019s enjoyable. Madge has been awesome.\u201d Brisbane coach Michael Maguire. Credit: Zak Simmonds The relationship between Walsh and Maguire is less than a season old, although Maguire would have liked it to have commenced earlier. Walsh has New Zealand heritage and Maguire attempted to get him to pledge his allegiance to the Kiwis when he was coaching the national team. \u201cHe did, that was my first year, in 2021, he asked me to be part of the Kiwis,\u201d Walsh says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI declined it, with all due respect. I love Queensland and Australia. That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t love the Kiwi side of me, but I grew up here and that\u2019s what I want to represent \u2026 I will always put my hand up to represent Australia. \u201cTo be able to put my last name on one of them jerseys, I would be doing my family proud.\u201d There are few opportunities to escape from football, or the public view, when you\u2019re the shiniest star in rugby league. The Broncos No.1 has 540,000 Instagram followers, more than every single NRL club, save for his own. Christened as the \u201cJustin Bieber of rugby league\u201d, by ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys, he is one of the biggest stars in Australian sport. There was a brief respite, of sorts, from public life on Wednesday when Walsh was unveiled as the ambassador of AUSX Supercross in Redcliffe. It was a chance for the Maroons star to take his four-year-old daughter, Leila, to a promo event at Kayo Stadium. Reece Walsh celebrates with his daughter Leila after a match in 2023. Credit: Getty Asked should Maguire be concerned about the prospect of his star player on a motorbike, Walsh quips: \u201cIf he saw me ride, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be too worried, I\u2019m elite. \u201cI take my footy very seriously, that\u2019s always going to be the number one priority. Having a daughter, that gets you away from footy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery single day you come home and she\u2019s got a smile on her face. Being able to experience these moments with her, it\u2019s what pulls me back to feeling like a kid again. \u201cI remember getting hand-me-down pants and boots from my brother to ride his motorbike. To be sitting here and kitted out on a motorbike with my daughter is pretty special \u2026 \u201cTo show her what hard work gets, to not let anyone put you down or say things, to persist through that and put one foot in front of the other. I want to be the best role model that I can for her. \u201cObviously I slip up here and there, but I try to keep working hard and putting one foot in front of the other, then I\u2019m doing a decent job.\u201d Whenever Walsh steps out in public, particularly in Queensland, he is mobbed. Everyone either wants a piece of him or has an opinion. Take last weekend, for instance. After a stellar performance, the only thing anyone wanted to talk about was his decision to selflessly gift Kobe Hetherington a try in the forward\u2019s milestone game. Perhaps it\u2019s one of the reasons why Walsh grants few interview requests, instead opting to give fans a glimpse into his private life through his own YouTube channel. \u201cIt\u2019s what comes with it,\u201d says Walsh of life in the NRL fishbowl.\n\nAdvertisement",

Are they owed protection? Are they going to be harmed in that other country? Do their personal circumstances mean that, once they are sent to a third country, they will never be able to leave? Will they ever practically be able to reunite with their family again?\" she questioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are the sort of basic human questions that the government should have to ask before exercising these powers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVerma said an example of a critical misunderstanding relates to the three men set to be sent to Nauru, where the government \"misunderstood certain critical health details in relation to some of these men and misunderstood the nationality of one of them\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dale, centre director and principal solicitor at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, told SBS News another element of the proposal is around retrospective criminality, which has the potential to criminalise something that was not a criminal activity at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we're still coming to terms with what that means specifically in this legislation, but that retrospective nature is something that all lawyers around Australia should be deeply concerned by,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Refugee advocates to launch 'urgent' legal challenge to stop Nauru deportation deal\n\n\"We were assisting one man who had been issued with this removal notice to Nauru, and the courts determined that his previous legal proceedings were flawed, that he had not been afforded due process, and thus that affected his ability to be removed to Nauru,\" Dale said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that the government is looking to legislate around these court decisions is incredibly alarming.\"\n\n\n\nLegislation 'secretive' and 'extremely dangerous'\n\nJana Favero, the deputy CEO at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the legislation sets an \"dangerous precedent\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that there are times when mistakes are made. We know that there are times when there have been delays in procedural fairness where there have been errors, either bureaucratic or in courts,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone should have the right to absolutely exhaust all their legal avenues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFavero alleged the proposed changes followed a pattern of the Albanese government targeting the rights of vulnerable people in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It can't be read in isolation. It also has to be read in conjunction with the three brutal bills that Labor passed at the end of last year, all of which are really forming this cobweb and framework that is denying access to legal justice, access to human rights safeguards for people in our community,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe government passed laws last year granting immigration officials additional powers to facilitate deportations, including the option to pay other countries to accept non-citizens from Australia.\n\n\n\n'This is not the way'\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley has described the bill as \"rushed, secretive and chaotic\", saying the Coalition was only briefed about the bill on the day it was introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not the way that the prime minister and his ministers should conduct policy around critical issues of national security,\" she said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted the Department of Home Affairs for comment.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has suggested that Bob Katter \"have a look at himself\" after the maverick federal MP threatened to punch a journalist on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nKatter's threat came after his heritage was questioned ahead of so-called pro-Australia rallies planned across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nKatter, 80, confronted a TV reporter and thrust a fist in his face when asked about his family's Lebanese heritage in fiery scenes in Brisbane on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Queensland MP had been expressing his support for Sunday's controversial anti-migration March for Australia rallies at a press conference when he suddenly became heated.\n\n\n\n\n\nKatter, who is federal parliament's longest-serving MP, became irate when asked about his Lebanese heritage by Nine Network journalist Josh Bavas.\n\n\n\nHis grandfather Carl Robert Katter immigrated from Lebanon to Australia in 1898.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't say that, because that irritates me, and I punch blokes in the mouth for saying that,\" Katter yelled, cutting off the reporter's question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am Australian. My family have been here since the dawn of time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKatter then approached Bavas with a raised fist when the reporter tried to ask what he thought about migrants who arrived in Australia with \"good values\".\n\n\n\n\"You're a racist,\" the veteran MP said, holding his fist close to the reporter's face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You cannot say what you just said without being identified as a racist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gentlemen, ladies, this man is a racist. Don't listen to him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBavas stood his ground, taking Katter to task about the confrontation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think it's fair to threaten journalists with a fist before they've even finished the question \u2014 I think it's quite offensive to threaten a journalist,\" he replied.\n\n\n\nBehaviour 'not what's expected' of politicians, Albanese says\n\nOn Friday, Albanese criticised Katter's interaction with the journalist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bob Katter, I like, but Bob Katter needs to have a look at that footage,\" the prime minister told Nine's Today show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Have a look at himself, frankly, and recognise that that\u2019s just not what we expect of any Australian, let alone someone who's in public office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're speaking to someone called Albanese. We've got a Senate leader called [Penny] Wong. Migration enriches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Except for the First Australians, we're all either migrants or descendants of them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal health minister Mark Butler similarly said that both Katter's threat and the physical approach of Bavas were \"completely unacceptable\".\n\n\n\nFederal MP Bob Katter approached Nine News reporter Josh Bavas with a raised fist when the reporter tried to ask what he thought about migrants who arrived in Australia with \"good values\". Source: AAP / Fraser Barton Liberal senator Jane Hume said there \"must be consequences\" for Katter's actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You should always be able to feel safe and respected at work, journalists and politicians, the idea of threatening violence is entirely unacceptable,\" Hume told Seven's Sunrise program.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud also weighed in, saying that Katter's behaviour was not \"becoming\", no matter \"who you are or how iconic you think you are\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\" I get questions that I don't like to answer. But when you put yourself into the public sphere and you have that privilege of sitting in that great building of parliament facing the most sacred building, you've got to live up to your responsibility,\" he told ABC radio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I don't think that sort of behaviour is appropriate for a federal member of parliament.\"\n\n\n\nKatter to be 'front and centre' at March for Australia rally\n\nThe MP for the Queensland seat of Kennedy had earlier claimed at the Katter's Australian Party press conference that he would be \"front and centre\" at the rally in Brisbane on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rallies have sparked safety fears for multi-cultural communities amid fears they may be targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rally in Brisbane will be held on the final weekend of the state's Multicultural Month.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO March For Australia condemned as 'undermining social cohesion' SBS News 05:10 English\n\nKatter claimed migrants who mostly move to Melbourne and Sydney were not embracing Australian culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't care whether you're born here or not, if you have anti-Australian sentiments then get the hell out of my country,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch for Australia anti-migration rallies are set to be held across the country, seeking to \"stand for the people, culture, and nation that built Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganisers have been linked with white nationalist ideas but they have distanced themselves from far-right groups.\n\n\n\nNine Network, Katter demand apology\n\nBavas later said he was trying to ask about the value migrant Australian families \"including the Katters and my own\" bring to the nation before he was cut off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In my near 20 years in journalism I've never experienced that kind of reaction from an elected representative,\" he said in a joint statement.\n\n\n\nNine Network stood by Bavas, demanding Katter apologise for his \"unacceptable\" behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"His baseless and offensive accusation of racism is an irresponsible attempt to shut down a legitimate line of questioning,\" Nine Network's Fiona Dear said in the statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nKatter also demanded an apology, publishing a Facebook post later in the day in which he said: \"To be seen as anything other than Australian is highly insulting to me.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Qantas has ordered another 20 Airbus A321XLR jets after making $1.6 billion in full-year profit, up 28 per cent from a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe airline posted a bottom-line net profit of $1.6 billion in the last financial year, up 28.3 per cent from a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts underlying pre-tax profit rose 15 per cent to $2.4 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue grew 8.6 per cent to $23.8 billion, thanks to growth in its international operations and strong demand for domestic business and leisure travel.\n\n\n\nThe airline will order another 20 Airbus A321XLR aircraft which will start arriving in 2028, taking its total order for the next-generation planes to 48 aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe jets have a range of 8,700km, around 3,000km more than the Boeing 737 it replaces, and will allow Qantas to launch flights to destinations across Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands that aren't currently viable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not only will the A321XLRs help us serve the corporate market travelling between Perth and the east coast of Australia, they will also allow us to expand flying on existing routes into South East Asia and open up new possibilities like Perth-India and Adelaide-Singapore,\" Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson said.\n\n\n\nQantas' first two A321XLRs, configured for domestic and short-haul international trips, are expected to begin flying in mid-September on the Sydney-Melbourne and Sydney-Perth routes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Investing in new aircraft is one of the most significant ways that we can provide our customers with a better flying experience, and these billion-dollar investments are possible because of our continued strong financial performance,\" Hudson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nQantas will pay investors a final dividend of 16.5 cent per share as well as a special dividend of 9.9 cents per share.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Qantas was ordered to pay a $90 million penalty for what was has been dubbed the largest case of illegal sackings in the country's history.\n\n\n\n\n\nQantas outsourced more than 1,800 baggage handlers, cleaners and ground staff in 2020, in a move the Federal Court ruled was designed to curb union bargaining power in wage negotiations\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "You might have noticed that the second weekend of the season delivered new narratives for tipping consideration. Manchester City, last week deemed in title contention thanks to their season-opening win over Wolves, are now apparently back out of the title race after being shown up by Tottenham. By the end of the third round, however, Pep Guardiola might be back in with a shot if he can oversee a rebound win at Brighton.\n\nBut the weekend\u2019s main drawcard is Arsenal\u2019s trip to Liverpool for a high-profile meeting between last season\u2019s runners-up and champions, and also two sides on a maximum of six points. Eberechi Eze is set to make his Gunners debut, while Reds striker Hugo Ekitike is looking to add to his record of three goals from three games across all competitions for his new club.\n\nSpurs, the only other team with two from two, is also yet to concede a single goal under Thomas Frank, and Ange Postecoglou\u2019s replacement will try to keep it that way when hosting a spirited Bournemouth outfit who have already pushed Liverpool to the brink and beaten Wolves.\n\nIn the crisis department, Manchester United welcomes Burnley three days after the embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to fourth-tier Grimsby Town, which has left manager Ruben Amorim on the brink.",

    "text": "Chief financial officer Race Strauss said: \u201cImportantly, all key financial metrics included in the prospectus were met or exceeded.\u201d Virgin is standardising - and making more dense - its seating. The company\u2019s transformation program aims to enhance revenue through more offerings, cutting costs through improved productivity, and driving deeper loyalty to Virgin\u2019s Velocity program. The cost of the IPO and Qatar Airways \u201cwet lease\u201d transaction were $115.9 million. The deal gives Virgin access to Qatar\u2019s international longhaul network, without the cost of maintaining the fleet. The company\u2019s transformation program is expected to generate $400 million in benefits in 2026 and more for the next few years \u201cand beyond\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a high inflationary environment in aviation and so we need to be not just offsetting [the inflation] but getting beyond it,\u201d Emerson said. Seat densification Strauss said: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of the fleet density opportunities, putting the additional aircraft in the fleet, we\u2019re only a little more halfway on that.\u201d Additionally, Virgin Australia Regional Airlines is being simplified and more technology benefits are coming. \u201cThere\u2019s a long pipeline still to come,\u201d Stauss said.\n\nPart of the transformation involves a seat densification program. CEO Virgin Australia Dave Emerson. Credit: Edwina Pickles Emerson said adding more seats to the aircraft \u201creally benefits the customer because... Sometimes today we show up in the plane has a few more or few fewer seats than we had planned and that\u2019s not great for the customer experience.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re setting it up now so each plane is set up with exactly the same configuration and for some of the planes that needs an extra row of seats, but not all of them.\u201d Other revenue streams are strong too. Velocity contributed $450 million, up from $409 million and added 900,000 new members.\n\nLoading \u201cThe Qatar deal has really helped our Velocity program and created a very positive dynamic for customers,\u201d said Emerson, who noted that on a profit and loss basis \u201cit hasn\u2019t really affected us positively or negatively\u201d. Atlas Funds chief investment officer Hugh Dive said Virgin\u2019s results had to be read in parallel with Qantas\u2019 to get a reading of where the company stood. While Virgin had smaller capital expenditure than Qantas which is refreshing its fleet, overall the airlines were tracking in a similar direction. Virgin\u2019s load factor \u2013 a measure of the used seat capacity, or the fullness of a flight \u2013 is at 84.9 per cent compared to Qantas domestic at 78.1 per cent.\n\n\u201cVirgin\u2019s load factor is a lot higher than Qantas domestic \u2013 but both are pretty good,\u201d said Dive. Jetstar domestic meanwhile is at 89.5, which helps explain its contribution to Qantas. Revenue rose as well to $5.8 billion in 2025 from $5.63 billion in 2024, a growth of 3.1 per cent. Virgin made a successful return to the sharemarket in June, valued at $2.3 billion, after selling $685 million worth of stock to fund managers and retail investors at $2.90 a share. Virgin was delisted from the ASX in 2020 amid mounting debts and losses. Having entered administration, it was bought by US-based Bain Capital, the private equity firm Emerson worked for before joining Virgin\u2019s management in 2021.",

    "text": "Loading Although it will take the best athletes more than two hours to finish the race, you shouldn\u2019t be fooled. The best will be running very fast. Crazy fast. The men\u2019s race is expected to be won in around 2 hours and 5 minutes (2:05). To run that time, athletes will have to complete every kilometre in just under three minutes. That works out at 72 seconds for every 400m, or 18 seconds for every 100m. How fast is that? The best way to understand that pace (for mere mortals who know the struggle of a treadmill) is to do this: go to your treadmill and turn the speed up to 20 (km/h). See if you can last 30 seconds. The world\u2019s fastest men\u2019s marathoners can set it to 20 km/hr and run for two hours. The world\u2019s best women do it on 19 km/hr.\n\nRoughly speaking, a three-hour marathon equates to running at 14 km/hr on the treadmill. The course The Sydney Marathon was first opened to the public in 2001 as a way for your average Joes to get a chance to complete the course that the best athletes in the world had run at the 2000 Olympics. It\u2019s changed in the years since, but will still feature some of the original course, including its most appealing features. Highlights will include running across the Harbour Bridge, the gruelling final uphill lap to Mrs Macquarie\u2019s Chair, and a finish in front of the Opera House. The result: this marathon will have the most elevation of any of the majors, a fact which is sure to test even the best, as Hassan herself said on Thursday that she was \u201cnot good at hills\u201d.\n\nHow to watch There are several key spots for spectators to watch the marathon this year. Those who want to see the gun go off at the start line should aim to be at Miller St in North Sydney by 6:15am. Other key viewing areas are Barangaroo (from 6:30am), Martin Place (from 6:40am), Randwick (from 7:30am), and Moore Park (from 7:55am). There will be several fan sites along the course, complete with DJs, face painters, and even Drag Queens watching on when the race passes through Taylor Square. The first runners are expected to cross the finish line from 8:30am, with the last of the finishers expected at around 3:15pm. Workenesh Edesa Gurmesa winning the 2024 race.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size To the untrained eye, Reece Walsh looks like he\u2019s making it up as he goes along. A flick pass here, a goose step there. Maybe a short-side raid or a chip-and-chase, as likely to come out on the first tackle as the last. How can opposition defences know what\u2019s coming because the flying fullback seemingly doesn\u2019t know himself? But this is where the rugby league world has got it all wrong. The greatest dummy Walsh has ever sold is the notion that he\u2019s doing it all off the top of his head. That the audacious plays that make highlight reels when they come off - and give Brisbane coach Michael Maguire a coronary when they don\u2019t - are the result of unscripted, ad-lib football. Nothing is further from the truth. \u201cThe way I play, people think it\u2019s off the cuff and it\u2019s just luck, but the hours spent in the video room, watching teams, watching how they defend, their habits and tendencies, my brain doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cThe way I play, people enjoy watching it, but it\u2019s [about] the things they don\u2019t see; the hours that I put in on the [training] field, even with \u2018Madge\u2019 [Maguire], going over plays, picking his brain about things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very passionate about my footy. I want to try to be the best player I can be and it\u2019s something I pride myself on, working hard and spending those hours on the training paddock when there\u2019s no one around watching.\u201d Sit down with Maguire, and he\u2019ll describe Walsh as a student of the game. Whether it\u2019s spending countless hours on the training track or forever studying video footage off it, the fullback\u2019s workday is longer than most. It prompts the question; is the most flashy, flamboyant star in the game a footy nerd? \u201cYou tell me,\u201d Walsh laughs. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching every single game every week, watching my games back, is that a footy nerd? Reece Walsh leaves defenders in his wake. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI don\u2019t really think that\u2019s being a footy nerd, that just comes with it. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not a one mould fits all. It\u2019s just what I enjoy doing, trying to be the best I can for myself. \u201cIf that\u2019s watching a bit more video, working on a few more things. I\u2019m not the only guy who does it. There\u2019s a lot of guys in our squad that work extremely hard on their craft to be the best.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe greatest fullback of the modern era, Billy Slater, was given simple riding instructions from Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy. Slater was given the freedom to express himself however he liked on the football field, but only if he first perfected the play at training. It\u2019s a similar relationship between Walsh and Maguire. \u201c100 per cent. If I haven\u2019t got something right, if I haven\u2019t trained it, that\u2019s when he is disappointed,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cHe does say a lot about putting those hours and extras in. Even after our trainings are done, we practice things and it comes out in the games. \u201cThe time spent practising stuff, you might not get it within the first 10 goes or whatever it is, but when you do things right that you\u2019ve practiced, it\u2019s enjoyable. Madge has been awesome.\u201d Brisbane coach Michael Maguire. Credit: Zak Simmonds The relationship between Walsh and Maguire is less than a season old, although Maguire would have liked it to have commenced earlier. Walsh has New Zealand heritage and Maguire attempted to get him to pledge his allegiance to the Kiwis when he was coaching the national team. \u201cHe did, that was my first year, in 2021, he asked me to be part of the Kiwis,\u201d Walsh says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI declined it, with all due respect. I love Queensland and Australia. That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t love the Kiwi side of me, but I grew up here and that\u2019s what I want to represent \u2026 I will always put my hand up to represent Australia. \u201cTo be able to put my last name on one of them jerseys, I would be doing my family proud.\u201d There are few opportunities to escape from football, or the public view, when you\u2019re the shiniest star in rugby league. The Broncos No.1 has 540,000 Instagram followers, more than every single NRL club, save for his own. Christened as the \u201cJustin Bieber of rugby league\u201d, by ARL Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys, he is one of the biggest stars in Australian sport. There was a brief respite, of sorts, from public life on Wednesday when Walsh was unveiled as the ambassador of AUSX Supercross in Redcliffe. It was a chance for the Maroons star to take his four-year-old daughter, Leila, to a promo event at Kayo Stadium. Reece Walsh celebrates with his daughter Leila after a match in 2023. Credit: Getty Asked should Maguire be concerned about the prospect of his star player on a motorbike, Walsh quips: \u201cIf he saw me ride, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be too worried, I\u2019m elite. \u201cI take my footy very seriously, that\u2019s always going to be the number one priority. Having a daughter, that gets you away from footy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery single day you come home and she\u2019s got a smile on her face. Being able to experience these moments with her, it\u2019s what pulls me back to feeling like a kid again. \u201cI remember getting hand-me-down pants and boots from my brother to ride his motorbike. To be sitting here and kitted out on a motorbike with my daughter is pretty special \u2026 \u201cTo show her what hard work gets, to not let anyone put you down or say things, to persist through that and put one foot in front of the other. I want to be the best role model that I can for her. \u201cObviously I slip up here and there, but I try to keep working hard and putting one foot in front of the other, then I\u2019m doing a decent job.\u201d Whenever Walsh steps out in public, particularly in Queensland, he is mobbed. Everyone either wants a piece of him or has an opinion. Take last weekend, for instance. After a stellar performance, the only thing anyone wanted to talk about was his decision to selflessly gift Kobe Hetherington a try in the forward\u2019s milestone game. Perhaps it\u2019s one of the reasons why Walsh grants few interview requests, instead opting to give fans a glimpse into his private life through his own YouTube channel. \u201cIt\u2019s what comes with it,\u201d says Walsh of life in the NRL fishbowl.\n\nAdvertisement",

Without that support it will be difficult to navigate the various challenges facing the Group and to create a sustainable future for the business.\n\n\u201cThe Group has sourced additional funding to enable The Star to continue to provide thousands of jobs and support tourism and entertainment in the markets in which we operate.\u201d\n\nLoading\n\nThe loss included significant items of $212 million relating to the writedown of the value of its Brisbane casino, which is being sold to its consortium partners, redundancy costs, heightened regulatory costs and fines as well as raised funding costs due to the precariousness of its financial position.\n\nGroup revenue and earnings declined despite $100 million of cost cuts last year, and the group flagged that more cuts are planned for this year.\n\nStar said the declining performance reflected new regulatory burdens like carded play and cash limits and the fact that it is losing market share to gambling rivals.\n\nStar said trading activity stabilised towards the end of June \u201calthough at depressed levels\u201d. Cash levels were $234 million as of June 30 but declined to $189 million this week.\n\nStar said there remained material uncertainty regarding the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern citing factors like the impending money laundering fine from AUSTRAC, continuing negotiations with lenders, and the group\u2019s attempts to regain its casino licences.",

Photo: Courtesy of Brewster Hjorth Architects\n\n13 variations totalling $22,700 have been agreed since the last report to council, with $92.28 million being the revised construction contract sum, currently under the forecasted completion cost of $122 million, but more is yet to come.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was noted that the forecast was provided in February 2024 with an anticipated completion date for December of 2024, but now there are a \u201csignificant number of variations \u2026 which will place further pressure on the allocated budget for this project,\u201d according to Council documents.\n\nDocuments reveal that $22,237.49 has been approved for 50m scoreboard audio integration, and $5,358.88 for pool hall clock power provisions.\n\nThe roof has been a highly contentious aspect of the redevelopment. Photo: Courtesy of Brewster Hjorth Architects\n\nCouncillors agreed that reports and attachments should be confidential, given the scale and importance of the project to the community but one member of the community called for transparency.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that again we have an item that is being held in. closed session,\u201d local Davie Macdonald said.\n\n\u201cAs a person that was engaged from the very beginning of the first consultations on the swimming pool, I \u2026 fail to understand why now a project update should necessarily be closed to public knowledge.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAt the last election, councillors, especially the \u2026 independents and the Labor councillors \u2026 came with a policy of transparency and openness. I would really like to know more information.\u201d\n\nNorth Sydney pool is to face further delays. Photo: Destination NSW\n\nThe redevelopment has triggered a series of lawsuits, with North Sydney Council suing Brewster Hjorth Architects for a breach of contract as the roof design process caused significant delays.\n\nIcon is suing the council for $28 million in damages, due to the delays the design changes of the roof structure caused.\n\nThe Mayor said North Sydney Council does value transparency, but it is necessary to keep the meeting closed due to legal reasons.\n\n\u201cLike other councils on major projects, there is legal professional privilege and commercial in confidence, at the very end of the project and the end of the litigation I know that this council will release everything.\u201d",
