    "text": "The price of gold has continued to soar, hitting \ufeff$US5300 an ounce overnight, driven by a plunging US dollar and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nThe greenback slumped to its lowest value in nearly four years after US President Donald Trump declared this week he was not worried about the value of the American currency.\n\nAdding to concerns on financial markets has been Trump's decision overnight to send a huge naval force towards Iran, and threatening an attack on the Middle Eastern state unless a nuclear deal is achieved.\ufeff\n\nThe price of gold bullion has jumped to $US5300. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nHow long can Aussie dollar surge last?\ufeff\n\nAustralia's dollar, meanwhile, has risen to its highest level against its US counterpart since February 2023, buying 70.11 US cents yesterday after climbing 1.4 per cent.\n\nBut economists are uncertain whether the jump against the greenback will continue for the rest of this year.\n\nA Commonwealth Bank of Australia investor update today says it would take a \"significant shift\" in economic fundamentals, such as the value of Aussie shares and commodity prices, for the dollar to achieve 75 US cents.\n\nInstead, the bank expects the currency to trade at 70 cents against the greenback for some time.\n\n\"We expect AUD/USD to decline as 2026 progresses.\"\ufeff\n\nSo it may be better to book that trip to the US sooner, rather than later.\n\nThe US Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz is part of a huge force heading to Iran. (Cha Geun-ho/Yonhap via AP) (AP)\n\nGold 'could hit \ufeffUS$6000'\n\nThe surge in gold prices and falling US dollar mark a flight from currencies and sovereign bonds - or debt securities issued by national governments, according to experts.\n\nThe chief executive of UK-based global financial advisory firm de Vere Group, Nigel Green, believes gold could reach $US6000 by the end of this year.\n\n\"Gold benefits when political signals create uncertainty about growth, inflation, and international cooperation,\" \ufeffhe said.\n\nThe jump in gold also reflects mounting concern in financial markets over government borrowing as debt levels across major economies continue to rise.\n\nAlso propelling central banks and investors to seek refuge in gold has been uncertainty in key bond markets, such as Japan.\n\nGreen believes this week's spike in the gold price is more than a blip.\n\n\"The $US5000 milestone marks a beginning rather than an endpoint. We believe $US6000 is not unrealistic by the end of the year.\"\n\nNEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.",

(Getty)\n\nBut if you've forgotten to tell your employer to stop garnishing your wages for fully-paid HECS debts, you might need to act fast.\n\n\ufeffDirector of Tax Communication at H&R Block Mark Chapman told nine.com.au that Australians who don't stop redundant repayments are essentially giving the federal government a no-strings-attached loan.\n\n\"If you do overpay, the money isn't lost, but you won't actually see it again until tax time,\" Chapman explained.\n\n\"You have to lodge your tax return, and at that point, the ATO will repay it. But that does mean that there will be quite a lengthy delay.\n\n\"You're basically just using the money to make a free loan to the government, which doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nAustralian pool manager Maddie paid off her $12,000 HECS debt late last year.\n\nShe told nine.com.au \ufeffthe 20 per cent reduction shaved off around $2500 from her balance, meaning she could make one voluntary payment and reduce it to zero.\n\nMaddie hasn't told her employer about paying it off yet.\n\n\"There's very little clear or accessible information about paying off HECS \u2013 especially about what steps to take once it's fully cleared,\" she said.\n\n\"\ufeffThe lack of guidance makes it confusing and easy to miss important steps.\"\n\nShe expects a hefty tax return come June 30.\n\nMaddie paid off her $12,000 HECS debt in December 2025. (Supplied)\n\nHECS debt repayments don't automatically stop even if you log onto MyGov and find the balance has reached zero, Chapman said.\n\nYou need to fill out a tax form \ufeffcalled a \"withholding declaration\", which indicates to your employer that you no longer have a HECS debt.\n\nIt's as simple as ticking the box \ufeff\"no\" on the form when it asks if you have a Higher Education Loan Program (HELP), VET Student Loan (VSL), Financial Supplement (FS), Student Start-up Loan (SSL) or an Australian Apprenticeship Support Loan (AASL) debt.\n\nOnce this has been lodged, your next weekly, fortnightly or monthly pay will be a little bigger.\n\nThis figure will vary depending on your salary and what your regular contributions were.\ufeff\n\nFor example, anyone earning between $67,001 and $15,000 pays 15c for each dollar over $67000.\n\nThe HECS debt 20 per cent reductions were applied to loans last year. (Supplied)\n\n\"Say you're having $500 taken out of your salary each month to pay your HECS bill. If your HECS bill is no longer there, that $500 is paid to you in extra cash,\" Chapman added.\n\n\"If you told your employer that the HECS debt is gone, that immediately puts more money into your pocket.\n\n\"If you haven't yet, it's not something to panic about, but you should always make sure that you do actually notify your employer as soon as possible because that just makes financial sense for you.\"\n\nIf your HECS debt has reduced to a small amount, Chapman said it is important to clear it to zero before filling out the withholding declaration form.\n\nMark Chapman, Director of Tax Communications at H&R Block (Supplied)\n\n\"\ufeffIf it is a bigger balance, that will actually cost you in terms of additional indexation,\" Chapman said.\n\n\"Your tax agent will be able to give you specific advice regarding your particular circumstances.\"\n\nMaddie said it feels like a financial burden\ufeff has been lifted from her shoulders after years of compulsory payments.\n\n\"Even though I didn't finish my degree, carrying a HECS debt of over $12,000 was something that weighed on me,\" she said.\n\n\"Paying it off feels like a massive relief. I no longer feel guilty about leaving university, and mentally it feels like closing a chapter.\n\n\"Financially, it means I can focus more on travelling and future goals without the ongoing pressure of student debt hanging over me.\"\n\nThe information provided on this website is general in nature only and does not constitute personal financial advice.

    "text": "The state government has walked away from a central Queensland wind farm, saying it does not align with its energy road map but will instead partner with another wind farm in the state's north-west.\n\nThe Moah Creek Wind Farm, proposed by private developer Central Queensland Power (CQP), would be built on agricultural land 30 kilometres west of Rockhampton, with 60 turbines to power almost 200,000 homes.\n\nPublicly owned generator CleanCo was in partnership to acquire the project.\n\nHowever, it announced in a statement on Wednesday that it had assessed all projects in development and the Moah Creek Wind Farm did not align with its \"current strategic activities, commercial portfolio and investment priorities, given changing energy market conditions\".\n\nCleanCo said it had withdrawn from further development and all delivery activities for Moah Creek Wind Farm but remained in discussion with CQP about a \"potential future offtake opportunity\".\n\nThe former Palaszczuk government announced in October 2023 that CleanCo had partnered with CQP and once development was completed, it would transition to public ownership.\n\nIt was CleanCo's first partnership since it was established in 2018.\n\nA day after the company announced its withdrawal from the central Queensland project, the Crisafulli government said CleanCo had signed a 10-year agreement with Windlab in the state's north-west to secure 75 per cent of Kennedy Energy Park's wind energy output from 2028.\n\n\"We know the energy shift towards renewables can have a positive impact on regional communities, but only if it is done right,\" Treasurer David Janetzki said.\n\nThe Kennedy Energy Park is located near Hughenden between Mount Isa and Townsville, and includes a 12-turbine, 43-megawatt wind farm, more than 55,000 solar panels and 2 megawatts of battery storage.\n\nMoah Creek Wind Farm still going ahead\n\nNick Holland, pictured with his wife Melanie and son, said he would see up to 20 wind turbines from the Moah Creek Wind Farm, with the closest 2 kilometres away. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nCentral Queensland Power, a joint venture between Energy Estate and Renewable Energy Systems, said its project would still progress.\n\n\"The Moah Creek project remains a well\u2011positioned project,\" director Matt Rebbeck said.\n\nThe project secured federal funding in October last year through the Australian Government Capacity Investment Scheme.\n\nCQP would not disclose the amount of funding but has confirmed to the ABC that it remained in place and would be used going forward, but it was also open to another investor.\n\nThe Holland's 2,500-hectare farm at Wycarbah has been in Nick's family for generations. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nWycarbah grazier Nick Holland, who neighbours the project, last year submitted to the state government a petition with more than 1,000 signatures calling for the wind farm to be axed and the state to withdraw investment.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Holland said he was relieved that CleanCo had withdrawn.\n\n\"It was not the right location, given the number of residents in the vicinity and the impact it would have on those,\" he said.\n\nMr Holland said other concerns included the visual impacts, construction phase, impact on locals, vegetation buffers and run-off.\n\n\"There's a large number of people that are in the vicinity of this project that all shared all their different concerns of how it would affect them,\" he said.\n\nThe Moah Creek Wind Farm project is currently under assessment through the federal government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.\n\nIt secured state government approval in 2023.\n\nHeartland of wind farm woes\n\nIn May last year, the state government axed the $1bn wind farm project axed , 40 kilometres west of Rockhampton, five months after it had secured approval from the state planning department.\n\nAbout 200 kilometres away between Rockhampton and Mackay, Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest's 100-turbine Clarke Creek Wind Farm $1 billion wind farm opens after three years of construction.\n\nThe Clarke Creek Wind Farm was approved before the LNP state government changed the legislation in 2025.\n\nThe new laws require new development applications to have public consultation and community benefit agreements with local councils, and must allow third-party appeal.",

    "text": "The Tasmanian government has appointed receivers and managers to protect the manganese ore stockpile paid for by taxpayers at the Liberty Bell Bay smelter in the state's north.\n\nLiberty Bell Bay is Australia's only manganese alloy smelter.\n\nIt was given a $20 million loan from the state government in August, $14.5 million of which was used to buy one 23,000-tonne shipment of ore which was delivered in October.\n\nDespite this, operations at the troubled smelter have not resumed, after being paused indefinitely in May last year, with the company blaming ore supply issues and global price volatility.\n\nThe smelter was bought in 2020 by international company GFG Alliance, which is headed by British businessman Sanjeev Gupta.\n\nLiberty Bell Bay operates a manganese alloy smelter in northern Tasmania. (ABC News: Owain Stia-James)\n\nMinister for Business, Industry and Resources Felix Ellis said the move had been made following ongoing defaults under the state's loan agreement.\n\n\"Unfortunately, GFG has not delivered on its promises to Tasmanians and to its workers to restart operations, and the loan [has] not been repaid,\" he said.\n\n\"By securing the ore and not moving immediately to sell it, the government is maintaining options and providing opportunity for Liberty Bell Bay and interested parties to continue discussions about potential future operations at the site.\n\n\"We have engaged extensively with Liberty's owners over recent months, including on potential future pathways for the business.\n\nThe smelter, near George Town, is the only one in Australia that can process manganese alloy, used in steel-making. (Supplied: Liberty Steel Group)\n\n\" The state must act responsibly to protect public funds and ensure its secured position is maintained. \"\n\nThe Tasmanian government said it remained open to working with Liberty Bell Bay.\n\nLiberty Bell Bay has been contacted for comment.\n\nSuppliers left unpaid, some considering closure as a result\n\nThe chief executive of the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone, Susie Bower, said at least five businesses were collectively owed $1.3 million by Liberty Bell Bay.\n\n\"We have been working with suppliers for quite some time, since October last year,\" she said.\n\nSome suppliers are still waiting on payments from Liberty Bell Bay. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\n\"We found out last week that four [staff] have had to be let go from one business, and another business keeps ringing me every week saying: 'What is happening Susie? I may have to close my business.'\"\n\n\"This has quite significant ramifications with Liberty's non-payment of our suppliers.\n\n\"Liberty really do now need to step up and actually tell us what the future of this site will hold.\"\n\nMs Bower said some businesses have not been paid since December.\n\n\"After December those payments have all stopped,\" she said.\n\n\"They are on a knife's edge.\"",

    "text": "Farmers affected by the repeated closure of a key Mid North Coast route are sceptical about plans for an assessment of the notorious stretch of road.\n\nThe New South Wales government has announced a detailed corridor assessment of Waterfall Way and other roads between Bellingen and Dorrigo, nearly two weeks after a 200-tonne landslide closed the road.\n\nMotorists relying on Waterfall Way have been at the mercy of weather events for decades, with the latest closure the fourth in the past 12 months.\n\nA major landslip closed Waterfall Way in 2021. (Supplied: Transport for NSW)\n\nThe road is a key tourism and agricultural route between north-west NSW and the coast, vital for the transport of livestock, dairy and produce over the Great Dividing Range.\n\nMurray Grey stud breeder Sue Francis sent cattle to the abattoir at Wingham on the morning of the latest closure.\n\nWhat would normally be a three or four-hour trip turned into a 24-hour ordeal for her livestock and the driver transporting them.\n\nSue Francis's cattle was on a truck for 24 hours trying to get to the abattoir. (Supplied: Sue Francis)\n\n\"It's pretty hard to know that your cattle are on this sort of adventure,\" Ms Francis said.\n\n\"Yes the cattle have gone to slaughter, but we spend months making sure that that last day is one of comfort and as stress-free as possible.\"\n\nStress before slaughter, including during handling and transport, can reduce the quality of beef under the Meat Standards Australia (MSA) grading program.\n\n\"Because of the stress they went through, I doubt they will grade and fit into the MSA value grid,\" Ms Francis said.\n\n\" So I'll be losing probably a couple of hundred bucks per head on that load, as will everybody else who had cattle on that load. \"\n\nFor dairy farmers on the Dorrigo Plateau, the closure added four hours to the round trip for tankers transporting milk to the processor at Raleigh.\n\nDairy farmer Julie Moore was forced to change her milking schedule due to the closure. (Supplied: Julie Moore)\n\n\"Lots of the tankers do two runs to Dorrigo a day, so it makes an extremely long day for the drivers,\" Julie Moore said.\n\n\"If they're driving that back road [through Grafton] later in the night, they're on unfamiliar roads.\n\n\"It's a sealed surface but it's still not a road you want to be driving a milk tanker around at night.\"\n\nSolutions to be assessed\n\nNSW Regional Transport and Roads Minister Jenny Aitchsion said she was meeting with engineers and technical experts to assess the corridor and explore possible solutions.\n\n\"It is a very difficult situation because the mountain is essentially falling off,\" she said.\n\n\"We've had 150 tonnes coming down over the initial 50 tonnes of material that fell.\n\n\"We understand the frustration, but we don't want a situation where the weight of 10 cars comes down and hits someone trying to go about their day.\"\n\nMinister for Regional Transport and Roads Jenny Aitchison said short and long-term solutions would be considered. (ABC News: Romy Stephens)\n\nMs Aitchison said the NSW government had dedicated more than $100 million for remediation works to address slips in the area caused by severe weather in recent years.\n\nWhile alternative routes connecting the Mid North Coast and Northern Tablelands were being explored, Ms Aitchison said it would not be a simple fix.\n\nCrews are working to stabilise the active slope. (Supplied: NSW Government)\n\n\"We need to make sure we have the right data points in place and we do understand what the alternatives are,\" she said.\n\n\"We\u2019re looking at different options to strengthen the surrounding network so we can provide a better option during times of natural disasters.\"\n\nFarmers sceptical\n\nThe assessment is due to be completed by the middle of 2026.\n\nMs Moore said she would wait to see what concrete action came about as a result.\n\n\"There's been quite a few detailed studies done in the past 20 years and we're still at point A,\" she said.\n\n\" It's well and good for the assessment to be completed by the middle of the year, how many years will we then have to wait for the money to be allocated and work to commence? \"\n\nMs Francis said short-term repairs were no longer suitable.\n\n\"The patching and the band-aids are not working,\" she said.\n\n\"If the assessment is done this year, perhaps they can promise that work will be starting on it by the end of this year as well.\"",

    "text": "Male and female youth detainees in Alice Springs are being housed together for up to 72 hours without access to on-site health staff before being transferred to Darwin, prompting the Northern Territory Children's Commissioner to call for \"urgent reform\".\n\nIn a report released today, NT Children's Commissioner Shahleena Musk found \"the overall trajectory of youth detention in the NT \u2014 particularly for Central Australian young people \u2014 has worsened\" since the transfers of youth detainees from Central Australia to Darwin began in 2023.\n\nCommissioner Musk said of the 60 Alice Springs Youth Detention Centre (ASYDC) detainees transferred to Darwin during the first 10 months of the plan, all were Aboriginal, while 10 were girls, and 16 either had been or were being assessed for a disability.\n\nThe report represents the second part of a two-part investigation into what was originally the temporary transfer of detainees from Alice Springs to Darwin in 2024, but Commissioner Musk said its relevance had \"shifted significantly\" since the NT government effectively closed the Alice Springs Youth Detention Centre early last year.\n\nThe Alice Springs Youth Detention Centre has effectively been closed, with detainees now held there for up to 72 hours before being transferred to Darwin. (ABC News: Xavier Martin)\n\nIn her report, Commssioner Musk wrote that since the Country Liberal Party (CLP) had taken office in the NT in September 2024, young detainees in Alice Springs were \"routinely transferred to a facility over 1,500km away in Darwin, resulting in their disconnection from family, community and culture\".\n\n\"The purpose-built ASYDC facility has been reduced to a single block for short term and transitionary detention of children, while the majority of the site and infrastructure is being adapted to an adult facility,\" the report reads.\n\n\"Concerningly, it is used to house male and female young people together and for short periods of up to 72 hours only.\n\n\"This measure is in place until a remand facility in Alice Springs is finalised, however the projected dates for completion of this new infrastructure continue to push out.\"\n\nShahleena Musk says a failure to act on her findings will only \"compound the disadvantage faced by young people from Central Australia\" and increase the likelihood of reoffending. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nThe report states that the ASYDC's school has closed and there are \"no longer health or clinical staff on site\", while \"serious deficiencies\" have been identified \"reflecting systemic weaknesses across the NT youth justice system\".\n\n\"The concentration of youth detention in the one facility in Darwin undermines rehabilitation, family, community and cultural connection, and reintegration outcomes for Central Australian young people,\" Commissioner Musk wrote.\n\n\" Without urgent reform, the NT risks entrenching a system that is punitive, contra to best practice, and inconsistent with the rights of children under both domestic and international law. \"\n\nThe commissioner also found families of youth detainees in Central Australia \"are not being consulted and in some cases not contacted prior to their transfers to Darwin\".\n\nDepartment rejects all recommendations\n\nIn her report, Commissioner Musk made five recommendations she described as \"reasonable and achievable\", but all of which were rejected by the NT Corrections Department.\n\nCommissioner Musk said their rejection would only \"compound the disadvantage faced by young people from Central Australia\" and increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nIn response to a recommendation to notify detainees' families when they were transferred to Darwin, the department said while there was \"no legislative requirement\" to do so, an \"extensive review\" of service standards was under way.\n\n\"We endeavour, to the extent possible, to ensure that young people remain in contact with family, without compromising our staff or centres' safety and operational functions,\" the department wrote.\n\nAn ABC investigation last week revealed there were nine self-harm incidents requiring hospitalisation at the Holtze Youth Detention Centre in the year after it opened. (ABC News: Jayden O'Neill)\n\nThe department also said the transfer process could be \"unduly delayed\" if staff were required to provide Indigenous language translators, in response to another recommendation.\n\n\"Detainees may go through the charging and court processes without the assistance of an interpreter and still enter into the youth detention system with an idea of why they are detained,\" the department wrote.\n\n\" All transfers are explained in the simplest manner possible, which includes the use of aids such as picture books. \"\n\nThe department also defended its refusal to commit to adhere to its own policies, saying resources had been \"stretched\" following an \"influx of detainees into the youth detention system\".\n\nNine youths hospitalised after self-harm at new NT detention centre Nine youths ended up in hospital after self-harming at Darwin's new $130 million detention centre in the 12 months after it opened, documents released to the ABC under Freedom of Information laws have revealed.\n\n\"The department is dealing with a large cohort of young people, who enter and exit the youth justice system frequently, but are not in a stable position for long enough to allow thorough planning and preparations to occur,\" the department wrote.\n\n\"A lot of detainees have insufficient supports outside of a detention setting, despite the department's best planning and intentions.\"\n\nIn a statement also released today, Commissioner Musk said the department's response reflected a \"missed opportunity\" to ensure detainees were not further disadvantaged by the decision to consolidate the NT's youth justice centres.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly disappointing that the Department of Corrections has not accepted any recommendations made by the inquiry, including simply following their own existing policies and procedures, and committing to ensuring young people have access to interpreters for key decisions,\u201d she said.",

(ABC Gold Coast: Dominic Cansdale)\n\nBPS also claimed Qoin could be used to buy goods and services from a growing number of Australian businesses.\n\nAbout 96,000 Qoin accounts \u2014 or wallets \u2014 were issued, according to Federal Court documents.\n\nIn November 2021, a class action consisting of Qoin users was launched, amid growing concerns that many businesses registered on Qoin's website did not accept it as payment and that it had lost all value.\n\nIt came as the volume of Qoin sold on BTX collapsed from a high of $700,000 per day to almost zero by the end of 2022.\n\nLast year, BPS settled the class action by providing claimants with 4.3 million Qoin tokens.\n\nIn her judgement Justice Downs said \"the value of Qoin Tokens is likely to be limited\" but that the settlement was \"better than nothing\".\n\nBPS conduct 'condemnable', court finds\n\nASIC launched separate legal proceedings against BPS in October 2022.\n\nIt alleged BPS did not have the proper financial services licence, that it had falsely claimed that the number of Qoin businesses was rising and that the token could be traded for dollars or other cryptocurrencies on an independent exchange.\n\nIn May 2024, the Federal Court found that BPS had engaged in misleading conduct but was exempt from holding an Australian Financial Services Licence for a 10-month period.\n\nASIC successfully appealed that exemption finding last year, and the penalty hearing was conducted in Brisbane this week.\n\nBPS director Tony Wiese. (YouTube: Qoin)\n\nASIC had sought a $21-million penalty but BPS director Tony Weise told the Federal Court the company was on the \"brink of insolvency\".\n\nIn her judgement, Justice Downes stated the conduct of BPS was \"condemnable\".\n\nShe found it made false or misleading claims that Qoin could be exchanged for Australian dollars or other cryptocurrencies on an independent exchange.\n\nJustice Downes also found the claims that Qoin could be used to purchase goods or services from a growing number of businesses, or that it had been officially approved, were also false or misleading.\n\n\"The decline was persistent and known to BPS, and the fact that the representation remained for 12 months, whether resulting from inadvertence or gross carelessness, is condemnable,\" Justice Downes stated in her judgement.\n\nShe also found BPS carried out a financial services business without holding an Australian Financial Services Licence.",

    "text": "Countries across Asia are stepping up health screening measures after cases of a deadly virus were detected in India.\n\nAuthorities in India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia have enacted new testing regimes after two people were detected with the Nipah virus in West Bengal.\n\nThe illness has a 40 to 75 per cent fatality rate in humans, depending on a country's capacity to test, trace and treat those infected, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\n\nHowever, while it can spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nHere's what we know about the virus, how it spreads, its symptoms and what countries are doing about it.\n\nWhat is Nipah virus?\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic disease \u2014 one that spreads from animals to humans.\n\nThe virus sits in the same category as COVID-19 and Ebola and is most commonly spread by fruit bats.\n\nThe WHO says more specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products \u2014 such as raw date palm juice \u2014 containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection.\n\nScientists in Bangladesh have previously caught bats to test them for the virus. (Reuters: Mohammad Ponir Hossain, file)\n\nThe virus can also spread between humans, generally between close contacts.\n\nThere is also some evidence it can spread to other animals, including pigs, dogs, cats, sheep and horses, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIt was first discovered in 1999 after an outbreak in pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nSince then, outbreaks have occurred most years in Bangladesh and in India.\n\nWhat are Nipah virus symptoms?\n\nA sudden onset of flu-like symptoms is common for people with Nipah virus.\n\nIts incubation period is usually between 4 and 21 days.\n\nClimate change disease risk Climate change isn't just expanding the environments where deadly diseases can occur, it's also making their spread more likely as weather events become more extreme, researchers say.\n\nMedical experts say pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms can also develop, but the most serious complication is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain.\n\nPatients who suffer encephalitis stemming from Nipah virus have a higher mortality rate.\n\nPeople who recover may be left with permanent neurological damage, regular seizures and even personality changes.\n\nIn rare cases, the virus has been known to reactivate some time after a person has recovered from it.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for the virus currently, with intensive care the only option for those with serious infections.\n\nThere is also no vaccine licensed for use.\n\nWhat is happening in India?\n\nIndian health authorities said they had identified two people with the virus in West Bengal since December.\n\nThe National Centre for Disease Control said as a result it had \"initiated prompt and comprehensive public health measures\".\n\n\"A total of 196 contacts linked to the confirmed cases have been identified, traced, monitored, and tested.

    "text": "Home owners living beside the world's biggest hard-rock lithium mine in Western Australia's South West region are calling on the miner to buy out their homes or offer relocation.\n\nMany locals in the historical mining town of Greenbushes, 240 kilometres south of Perth, have struggled to coexist with the mine in recent years because of regular blasting, dust and noise pollution.\n\nThe Greenbushes mine \u2014 owned by the Sino-American company Talison Lithium \u2014 provides nearly 20 per cent of the world's hard-rock lithium supply, which is crucial to the energy transition.\n\nTrevor Stallard has lived in Greenbushes for 39 years, and he spent 15 of them working at the lithium mine.\n\nTrevor Stallard says locals feel trapped by a comparatively sluggish property market in the town. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nThe retired miner has decided that enough is enough.\n\n\"We didn't sign up for this,\" he said.\n\n\"The constant noise, the dust, the traffic early in the morning. The tremors twice a day.\"\n\nResidents say a mining blast on Sunday, January 11, rocked the town site. (Supplied)\n\nThe big blast\n\nThe final straw for Mr Stallard and some other residents was a big mining blast on January 11, which reverberated across the town.\n\nLocal Rick Fryer described it as \"the mother of all blasts\".\n\n\"It frightened the daylights out of so many people,\" he said.\n\n\" It just slowly formed into this massive, massive cloud. \"\n\nThe self-described \"newbie\" has lived in Greenbushes for the past 15 years.\n\nRick Fryer says dust from the mine is a constant nuisance. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\n\"I knew there was a mine here when we moved here nearly 15 years ago, but it wasn't this mine. Not the way it's operating now,\" Mr Fryer said.\n\n\"A lot of the residents, old-time residents, too, are really upset about what's happening to the town, to our town.\"\n\nA Talison Lithium spokesperson said the blast recorded 124 linear decibels (dBL), which breached the mine's Sunday noise limit of 120 dBL.\n\n\"This was Talison's first reportable breach of the airblast limit since that was set in our licence conditions approved in 2015,\" the company said.\n\nThe company said the typical blast would measure 100 dBL, making the January 11 explosion \"considerably more noticeable\".\n\nTalison Lithium says the January 11 blast breached its noise limit and was reported to the regulator. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nAn internal and external investigation concluded that a routine \"pre-split\" blast, a critical technique used to cleanly break rock away from the pit wall, was the cause, according to the company.\n\nTalison Lithium said it had already implemented several changes to the way it conducted such blasts.\n\nThe ABC has spoken to home owners who believe the regular and repeated vibrations from mine blasting have damaged ceilings and cracked drywalls.\n\nThe company said that while some impacts were inherent to mining, it was committed \"to do better and be a good neighbour\".\n\nThe cumulative effects of dust, traffic and noise have ignited calls for a home buyback scheme. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nHome owners want buybacks\n\nThe recent blast has stirred further discontent as the mounting effects of the noise, traffic and dust take a toll on the town's residents.\n\nSome residents have complained of persistent coughs, watering eyes, and the nuisance of having to deal with the thin white dust coating cars and homes.\n\nMr Stallard said the mine's impacts had intensified since approved production capacity increased to 2.8 million tonnes of lithium concentrate a year in 2019.\n\n\"I intended to live here the rest of my life, I really did,\" Mr Stallard said.\n\n\"But it's got to the stage where everything's incessant, and it's not going to stop.\n\n\"Sooner or later you just go, 'Enough's enough.'\"\n\nMr Stallard wants the mine to set up a voluntary home buyback or relocation scheme to help locals leave town.\n\nTalison's mining operation supplies 20 per cent of the world's lithium. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nNorthern Star Resources set up such a scheme in 2021 for residents in the suburb of Williamstown, on the edge of Kalgoorlie's Super Pit gold mine.\n\nTalison Lithium said it planned to operate for \"decades to come\", and that it would take time and meaningful consultation to develop a shared vision for the future with the community.\n\n\"It is too early to determine what will be recommended, but nothing should be ruled out,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, some locals feel their window of opportunity is closing as surrounding property markets outpace Greenbushes.\n\nThe town has a population of about 365 people, and the median house price is $395,000, compared to $595,000 at Balingup, just 11km away.\n\n\"A lot of them feel like they're trapped here because their house prices aren't going to go up,\" Mr Stallard said.\n\n\"They can't afford to buy elsewhere.\"\n\nTalison Lithium wants to be a \"good neighbour\" as it plans to continue its operations for decades to come. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\n'A good neighbour'\n\nThe miner has its eyes set on further expansion.\n\nWA's environmental authority is considering Talison Lithium's proposal to increase its development envelope by more than 25 per cent.\n\nSince Rob Telford was appointed Talison's chief executive in late 2024, the company has adopted a markedly conciliatory tone in its community relations.\n\nMr Telford has previously told the ABC he wants the mine to set the benchmark for transparency and community engagement.\n\nRob Telford has introduced a raft of measures to reduce impacts on nearby residents. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nTalison does not shy away from discussing its impacts and has previously expressed \"deep regret\" for them.\n\n\"We know we need to do better, and we are taking further steps to reduce impacts,\" a public statement read after the January 11 blast.\n\nFollowing community criticism last year, the company introduced a raft of measures, including real-time public dust monitoring, expanded dust suppression, and noise reduction on haul trucks, among other things.\n\nDust level exceedence attributed to the mine halved from eight incidents in 2024 to four last year, according to the company.\n\nTalison is also rebuilding Stanifer Street, a thoroughfare for haul trucks through the middle of town.\n\nThe company said it had considered ways to divert traffic away from the town, but it did not progress due to \"design challenges\" and the potential to create additional impacts.\n\nRick Fryer says the company needs to do more to address its impacts on locals. (ABC South West WA: Jon Daly)\n\nBut it is not good enough for Mr Fryer, who wants a bypass road built to divert traffic away from his home on Stanifer Street.\n\n\"It's very easy to say sorry after you do something,\" he said.\n\nMr Stallard believes managing the effects of a world-leading mining operation on the doorstep of a small community is impossible.\n\n\"I think they're doing everything they can. It's just not enough,\" he said.\n\n\"It's physically impossible to stop it.\"",

(Supplied: Alice Springs Town Council)\n\nCouncil chief executive Andrew Wilsmore said the projects were a \"strong sign of faith\" in the town, following the scrapping last year of plans for the multimillion-dollar Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Gallery of Australia in Alice Springs.\n\n\"We have got so many projects going on at the moment \u2026 it's a real show of faith that this is a town with a very strong future,\" he said.\n\nThe $20 million Todd Mall redevelopment will involve the mall's red bricks being replaced with white pavers, 12 trees removed and another 20 planted, a digital display board, a 10-metre sculpture installed on the church lawns, new seating, lighting, bubblers, bins, bike racks and toilets, and arbours designed to look like gum trees to cast shade over the pedestrian-heavy area.\n\nThe work is expected to be finished by the end of 2026.\n\nTwelve trees will be removed, but another 20 will be planted in the redeveloped mall. (Supplied: Alice Springs Town Council)\n\n\"We've also designed for a couple of other aspects around town; that's the Leichhardt Terrace, some of the Parsons Street connectivity and all the way through to the Todd Street,\" Mr Wilsmore said.\n\n\"Those are shovel-ready projects, and if we can secure additional funding, we'll see those brought to life.\n\n\"I have a trip planned to Canberra to try to keep those funds that were originally destined for the art gallery to actually stay here in Alice Springs.\"\n\nAndrew Wilsmore says the redevelopments are positive for Alice Springs. (ABC Alice Springs: Victoria Ellis)\n\nMakeover for popular shopping centre\n\nRedevelopment plans for the Yeperenye Shopping Centre, which sits between Hartley and Bath streets, would result in the building growing to include a four-level car park with more than 200 parking bays, a new loading dock and click-and-collect facilities.\n\nYeperenye managing director Owen Cole said the $27 million redevelopment would include office spaces and a rooftop bar and restaurant.\n\nThe design for Yeperenye Shopping Centre's redevelopment.

This is a hard-playing league \u2026 [but] that crossed the line.\n\n\"It concerned me \u2026 it rattled all of us. He's [Taylor] got a choke-hold \u2026 holding a guy by the neck. That is really dangerous.\n\n\"I was really scared for my player. I screamed at Terry, almost like a parent, like 'What are you doing?'.\n\n\"And Maldonado \u2026 he was not stopping. I am fired up and a little concerned.\"\n\nIn a post-game press conference, Mike Wells says he was \"fired up and a little concerned\". (ABC News)\n\nThe incident left the already injury-ravaged Bullets with one player on the bench, the 36ers awarded four free-throws and kicking on in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe 33-point loss was Brisbane's 16th from their last 17 games and follows losses of 32 and 38 points in their last two contests.\n\nAdelaide sharp-shooter DJ Vasiljevic stoked the flames further, describing the Bullets' actions as \"unprofessional\".\n\n\"Throwing cheap shots at us because they're going to finish last.

Got it Share A A A\n\nPacgold Limited has kept the drill bit busy and the excitement ticking over at its St George gold\u2013antimony project in North Queensland, wrapping up its maiden reverse circulation (RC) drilling program with another set of shallow, high-grade antimony hits. The company says the new results have added weight to the idea that a much larger mineralised system may be lurking below the surface. Gold and stibnite in quartz vein at Pacgold Limited\u2019s St George project in Northern Queensland. The first-pass nine-hole RC campaign, completed late last year, was designed to poke a few holes beneath historic workings at a once-forgotten antimony field that had already been flashing serious promise at surface. While the mineralised trend runs for more than a kilometre, drilling to date has tested just 200 metres of strike and even that light touch has delivered plenty of fireworks. The results from the last seven holes are now in. Two particular drill holes confirmed that antimony-rich quartz veins don\u2019t stop at surface. Standout hits included 1 metre at 12.8 per cent antimony from 41m downhole. A second intercept returned 3m running at 1.6 per cent antimony from 67m and included a richer 1-metre slice grading a stunning 4.4 per cent antimony from 68m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The upside of this vast tenement package is immense.\u2019 Pacgold Limited managing director Matthew Boyes Gold made its presence felt as well, adding extra shine to the story. Hits included a solid 8m grading 0.7g/t gold from 45m downhole and in another drillhole, the bit struck 1m at a steady 1.3g/t gold from 82m. Shallow mineralisation was also intersected, with 7m running at 0.5g/t gold from just 4m downhole in a third hole, including a 2m zone grading 1.2g/t gold from 8m depth. All up, seven of the nine RC holes drilled delivered anomalous antimony or gold - a tidy strike rate for a maiden program that barely scratched the edges of the system. Notably, the quartz veins remain open along strike to the north and south and down dip, leaving plenty of blue sky for follow-up drilling. The nine-hole program totalled 826 metres and intersected multiple north-trending quartz veins hosted in interbedded sandstone and shale, with widespread sericite alteration pointing to a fertile hydrothermal system. Historic records show the area previously produced about 60 tonnes of ore grading a staggering 60 per cent antimony from open pit and shallow underground workings during the 1960\u2019s - proof that the rocks here know how to deliver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd St George isn\u2019t a one-trick pony. The broader geological story shows Pacgold\u2019s tenure sits within a major north-northwest\u2013trending structural corridor that stretches for more than 20 kilometres and hosts multiple additional gold\u2013antimony targets. These include the company\u2019s Fence and Ridgeline gold-antimony prospects. Together with St George, the three prospects form part of a mineralised belt extending for more than 20 kilometres of strike across Pacgold\u2019s tenement package. Pacgold Limited managing director Matthew Boyes said \u201cIntersecting additional high grade antimony numbers confirms we have a large mineralised system which we have only just started to explore. The upside of this vast tenement package is immense, and 2026 is shaping up to be a massive year for our exploration crews.\u201d The timing of these results couldn\u2019t be better. Antimony has been thrust into the global spotlight as a critical mineral thanks to its role in defence, energy storage and advanced manufacturing, while gold prices continue to surge to new highs almost daily, supercharging the economics of any discovery that can grow scale and grade. With the North Queensland wet season temporarily slowing boots-on-the-ground fieldwork and drilling, Pacgold plans to return to St George in the June quarter with an expanded drill plan. The company says it plans to chase extensions beneath historic workings and fan out along the broader corridor to test a suite of high-priority regional targets. With shallow, high-grade antimony confirmed, gold along for the ride and kilometres of fertile ground still untouched, Pacgold looks to have plenty of reasons to be sharpening the drill bits ahead of what shapes as a very busy 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs antimony surges up government agendas and gold prices soar due to geopolitical uncertainty, the drilling at St George appears to be hitting the right rocks at exactly the right time.

Got it Share A A A\n\nAt least three iPhone models are unable to take or make phone calls on the Telstra network, in what is the latest telco glitch that left Australian customers momentarily unable to make Triple Zero emergency calls. By Thursday morning, a day after it first announced the issue, Telstra\u2019s customers still appeared unable to use their own network to call emergency services, with an update from the company stating that such calls would have to rely on rival networks. The iPhone X, which has been affected by the issue, was released in 2017. Michael Nagle The company said that if affected customers saw \u201cSOS calls\u201d appear on their device, they would now be able to make calls to Triple Zero by automatically connecting to an alternative mobile network if available. \u201cIt can take some time (e.g. one minute) for the impacted device to connect to the alternative mobile network when one is available,\u201d Telstra said in an update on Thursday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple issued the software update to the iPhone 12 and other older models on January 26, but iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X users soon began reporting connection issues. Telstra confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that it was investigating an issue with the phones connecting to its network, including to Triple Zero. Loading \u201cWe\u2019re working on this as a priority with Apple and will share updates as we have them,\u201d the company said on its website. \u201cWe recommend customers using these devices delay updating the software on their device until we confirm the issue is resolved.\u201d An Apple spokesperson said that by midday Thursday, it had identified a fix for Telstra customers and would be released in an upcoming software update.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Updated\n\nTelecommunications TPG says person dead after failed Triple Zero call When investigations were underway, Apple initially paused the software update that caused the issue; by Thursday afternoon, all versions of the update except for one \u2013 iOS 16.7.13 \u2013 had been rectified and reissued. The reliability of Triple Zero services has come under scrutiny since a major outage at Optus last year was initially linked to four deaths, though police later clarified the emergency call issue did not contribute to two of the fatalities. The others are under coronial investigation. In that incident, many phones that should have connected to another network to reach Triple Zero when Optus\u2019 service failed were unable to switch. Similar failures separately affected older Samsung phones last year. The Apple update this month was intended to stop that type of problem from happening in other situations to users of its phones. \u201cIn the rare event that these exceptional circumstances affecting mobile operators\u2019 networks were to happen again, some older mobile phones might still encounter the same issue reaching emergency services through an alternate available network,\u201d the company said in a post on its website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSoftware updates are available for the following iPhone and Apple Watch models that might be impacted by this network issue. You are encouraged to update your devices to the latest software version.\u201d One user posted on Reddit that the update had left their phone \u201cbeing near useless\u201d. \u201cEven after trying all of the troubleshooting and calling my carrier, I found that I was only able to connect to Wi-Fi,\u201d the social media user said. \u201cNo calls, no SMS, no data. My phone can only be used on Wi-Fi. \u201cAnd to top it off, it\u2019s even killed the ability to call 000 \u2013 the entire reason the update was released in the first place.\u201d Spokespeople for Optus and TPG, which also operates the Vodafone brand, said the Apple issue was not affecting their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Telecommunications Triple Zero was built for 1960s phones. Can it handle 2025? Carol Bennett, the CEO of Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, said public confidence in the Triple Zero system \u201chas taken a significant hit over the last 12 months\u201d. \u201cWe have seen outages, device compatibility problems, mixed messaging and general confusion,\u201d she said. Bennett noted the Triple Zero custodian had been in place for several months, but said the government must act further to create a \u201cresilient and evolving\u201d emergency communications system, including a national SMS to Triple Zero service as well as digital channels. \u201cIt is a top public safety priority that we strengthen and modernise the Triple Zero system. The chaos we saw last year is bleeding into this year. Enough is enough,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssociate professor Mark Gregory, a telecommunications expert from RMIT University, said vendors, successive governments and the Australian Communications and Media Authority had all dropped the ball on Triple Zero over the past 15 years, and called for regulatory reform. \u201cThere needs to be tightening of the regulations. To ensure that the vendors understand fully what their role is in making handsets available for use by consumers in Australia,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cThere needs to be performance measures within the legislation, and there needs to be penalties. And we need the government to step up and do something about it. But, you know, at the moment, it\u2019s crickets.\u201d Gregory said that changing technologies, such as rolling out upgrades from 4G to 5G, required specific oversight to ensure telcos didn\u2019t break critical infrastructure in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Investigation\n\nTelecommunications The emails that reveal how Optus downplayed the Triple Zero disaster Federal opposition communications spokeswoman Melissa McIntosh said Telstra had urged customers not to install the update until it had been fixed and advised people to find an alternative way to communicate. \u201cOnce again, I am giving the public service announcement on an important issue impacting the safety of our citizens when it should be the Albanese Labor government,\u201d she said in a statement. A spokesman for Communications Minister Anika Wells said Telstra and Apple had advised the government they were working to fix the issue urgently. \u201cPeople affected should contact Telstra as their service provider if they are concerned or have special needs,\u201d the spokesman said.

A large section of the loading bay floor and an adjoining retaining wall collapsed at Toll Group\u2019s healthcare distribution centre in Richlands, west of Brisbane, in late December, forcing the warehouse\u2019s closure over safety concerns. The $10 million custom-designed facility is used by Queensland Health and biotechnology multinational CSL to store and distribute vaccines and pharmaceuticals and was opened in 2023. A structural collapse at Toll\u2019s Richlands warehouse disrupted vaccination supply across Queensland. Toll Group Toll established a temporary storage facility following the collapse, but the incident resulted in delays to vaccine deliveries, including childhood vaccines offered through the National Immunisation Program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Flu season \u2018This is not the record we want to be breaking\u2019: Anti-vax ideology helping flu surge, GPs say A spokesperson for the Australian Medical Association Queensland said it was \u201caware of some practices experiencing difficulty accessing vaccines and has sought an urgent update from Queensland Health\u201d. Queensland Health said service providers should not be concerned about access to vaccine stock. \u201cWe took immediate action to avoid any disruption to vaccine supply following an incident at Toll\u2019s storage facility and Toll have established a temporary site in Victoria to support the Queensland vaccine program,\u201d a Queensland Health spokesperson said. \u201cIncoming orders are being prioritised according to most urgent need and it is anticipated that distribution will normalise soon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQueensland Health said stock remained safely stored with appropriate temperature control until access could be co-ordinated. The department was working with Toll to ensure access to the Richlands site as soon as possible. But the scope of structural damage is significant and will require engineering assessments to determine how and when the warehouse can return to operating as usual, with access to the site closed indefinitely. A CSL spokesman said the damage to the facility had not affected its supply chain given the company primarily focused on flu vaccines, which were not required for at least two months in preparation for the winter period. \u201cThe supply of CSL products to healthcare professionals and patients hasn\u2019t been impacted as we have been able to supply from within our network,\u201d the spokesman said.

Veteran playwright David Williamson uses this to fine comedic effect, taking aim at his favourite subject \u2013 status-obsessed Sydney. This time he skewers how the city\u2019s wealthy garner power and cultural cachet through appointments to boards of arts institutions. Mandy Bishop as Katie with Johnny Nasser as her husband Roger in The Social Ladder. Phil Erbacher Social climber Katie Norrie (Mandy Bishop) wants a seat on one of the most prestigious: the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s fund-raising foundation. She has a plan to win her glittering prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe invites Sydney\u2019s most influential couple to dinner. Pillars of the establishment, Catherine (Sarah Chadwick) and Charles Mallory (Andrew McFarlane) are major art collectors and on every elite cultural board in town. Desperate to impress, Katie has borrowed an Arthur Boyd masterpiece, hired a celebrity chef to cook, and invited a lefty filmmaker friend and his teacher wife to join them. What could go wrong? Pretty much everything \u2013 but no prizes for guessing that. The glee is in watching just how slippery the rungs on this social ladder will be. On a sparse stage, the first three scenes swiftly set up the three couples ahead of the crucial dinner party in this tightly plotted play. Katie has grown up in the Shire and never shaken her working-class accent. Her husband Roger (Johnny Nasser), born into wealth, has little patience for her social ambitions and has a beef with Charles Mallory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew McFarlane as ruthless billionaire Mallory with Sarah Chadwick as his wife Catherine. Phil Erbacher Mallory is a ruthless billionaire; his wife Catherine has a cut-glass English accent that conceals her humble roots. Ben (Matt Minto) and Laura Gregory (Jo Downing) have been dropped from Katie\u2019s social circle for several years and are sceptical of why they\u2019re suddenly back in favour. As the dinner party is poised to get under way, Katie\u2019s home is revealed in its bright, brash glory. The hostess in an eye-popping confection and Catherine in sleek ivory are delicious visual contrasts. Veronique Benett\u2019s pitch-perfect set and costumes are a joy to behold. As the dinner party descends into alcohol-fuelled mayhem, anti-woke Charles clashes with Ben over diversity and unions, with Laura over tax avoidance and with Roger over business dealings. Secrets are disclosed \u2013 not least about that wow painting. Bitterness and recriminations ensue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, too, does some Bollywood dancing. For amid the havoc, much fun is to be had in this light-hearted comedy. Matt Minto, Mandy Bishop and Sarah Chadwick in The Social Ladder. Phil Erbacher The three couples are stock types who argue their positions effectively, rather than fleshed-out characters. But the dialogue is sharp, there are laugh-out-loud lines, and Janine Watson\u2019s brisk direction maintains the pace with her capable cast. Bishop is terrific as the brazen Katie, whose grand plans become smoking ruins along with the roghan josh. Chadwick impresses as the imperious Catherine, as does McFarlane as her shameless old bull of a husband who can\u2019t say no to an income stream. The ending is upbeat, although Roger\u2019s volte-face comes out of the blue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is classic Williamson, replete with witty observations and great one-liners.

THEATRE\n\nGod\u2019s Cowboy\n\nFlight Path Theatre\n\nJanuary 28, until February 21\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605 At some point, I started to wonder if I\u2019d fallen into an alternative universe. Had I hit my head on the way to Flight Path, that quaint little Marrickville theatre with its surprise overhead aircraft crescendos? Had I lost my powers of comprehension? With queer love and sexual trauma the preoccupying themes, this debut play by stage producer Les Solomon resembles a conceptual sequence of soapy non sequiturs, scudding awkwardly into a middle distance. Or, perhaps, a lame steed that could not be brought to water, and so wanders into the desert. God\u2019s Cowboy idled several years in development and really should have remained in purgatory, instead of saddling up for this year\u2019s Mardi Gras.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter (Nathaniel Savy) in a dashing, kink-coded ensemble gifted by Daniel (Max Fernandez). David Hooley Characters describe and behave towards each other in ways that not only don\u2019t make sense, they profoundly baffle. The plot gropes towards a non-collapsible shape. The more provoking scenes, involving intimate boundaries being crossed, are not always discomforting in ways that are productive and justifiable. And the \u2018memory play\u2019 framing device suffers from amnesia, with the middle section seeming to forget that the story began in a fourth-wall-breaking flashback narrated by twins Peter (Nathaniel Savy) and Penny (Sophia Laurantus). When another flashback was deployed didactically at the end, the audience startled. The gist of it all: our young sibling pair are relating to us the time when they were both cast in a play of their own, and so crossed paths with fellow actor Daniel (Max Fernandez), a Midnight Cowboy-inspired gunslinger lead. First of all, it\u2019s odd that Fernandez got the role of this \u2018dark and mysterious\u2019 stranger when the impressively toned and charismatic Savy seems far more suited. But it\u2019s also confusing why either of the twins are drawn to the character of Daniel at all, given his repertoire appears to be making people feel uncomfortable with slimy drawls, snickers and an aggressively cavalier attitude towards sex. Yet, almost in the blink of an eye, we witness the earnestly angelic Peter, a lover of old-timey musicals, fall in love. Somehow, \u201cilliterate f--- nugget\u201d becomes the phrase that breaks the ice and bonds them. Peter had just hurled it at Daniel after (mistakenly) suspecting him of assaulting his sister. And now they\u2019re on the bedroom floor laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenny\u2019s subplot of her own queer romance feels perfunctory and wholly underdeveloped. There\u2019s another character, Demetrius (Tate Wilkinson Alexander), whose function is to prowl around with sly and shady intent. Another bizarre logic connecting events occurs between the two acts. Daniel, a former sex worker and the victim of horrific childhood abuse, has for a split-second been overtaken by the demons of his past, and turned monstrous himself when Peter is at his most vulnerable. Peter initially won\u2019t even talk to him. Then he\u2019s performing a gorgeous balletic dance for him. Then he\u2019s insisting Daniel meet his parents. There is another scene in which we see Daniel in the play-within-a-play monologuing about how God wants us to fornicate; to be unashamed of our \u201cmanacondas\u201d and \u201cpenis fly traps\u201d. The coup de grace at the end is a sentimental and improbable callback to Peter\u2019s favourite movie, Carousel. At last, it was over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOPERA\n\nHansel & Gretel\n\nOpera Australia, Joan Sutherland Theatre, Opera House\n\nJanuary 27, until February 25\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Sydney rejected the composer Engelbert Humperdinck when he applied to become the first director of the Conservatorium in 1914. The fact that Australia had gone to war with Germany just after he submitted his application might have had something to do with it. But Sydney has been more receptive to Humperdinck\u2019s most famous work, Hansel & Gretel as demonstrated by the warm audience reception for this revival by Claudia Osborne of the 1992 production by one of Opera Australia\u2019s best-loved and most frequently revived directors, the late Elijah Moshinsky. Stacey Alleaume as Gretel and Margaret Plummer as Hansel out front of the gingerbread house. Carlita Sari Photo Humperdinck\u2019s achievement was to combine the simplicity of easily memorable, folk-like melodies with harmonic sophistication and an ability to develop musical ideas without overworking them. With a predominantly female cast (there is only one male role) and a children\u2019s chorus, the sound-world is bright, leavened with richer and darker colours by finely-crafted orchestration. Whether the Grimms\u2019 story cuts through with today\u2019s young people I am unsure, but, in the absence of social media, one has to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMargaret Plummer (Hansel) and Stacey Alleaume (Gretel) drive the action with childish naughtiness and deft musical finesse. Plummer creates the obnoxiousness of little boys with gentle humour and sings with a voice of crimson depth and clarity. Alleaume\u2019s Gretel darts with playful mischief, fine filigree and silvery vocal delight. In Moshinsky\u2019s conception, the mother, Gertrud, in the libretto by Adelheid Wette (Humperdinck\u2019s sister), becomes a harassed scolding stepmother (thus enabling a moment of poignancy in the dream sequence of Act 2). Margaret Plummer as Hansel, Stacey Alleaume as Gretel and Helen Sherman as Stepmother. Carlita Sari Photo Helen Sherman projected the Stepmother\u2019s role firmly, injecting stridency into the sound when the children were particularly irritating. Shane Lowrencev sang the father\u2019s rollicking tipsy entrance song with robust tone and carried the role with lusty flexibility of line. Jane Ede was a fearsome Witch, singing with ringing clarity so that the voice lingered in the head like the foreboding laughter of an unfavourite great aunt. Shikara Ringdahl sang the Sandman\u2019s song with unassuming simplicity. Kathryn Williams as Dew Fairy with some of the troupe. Carlita Sari Photo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKathryn Williams\u2019 cameo as a clear-voiced Dew Fairy was supported by the clumsy awkwardness of a ballet-school troupe. Humperdinck subtly subverts the expectation of a surging operatic peroration by giving the final apotheosis to a children\u2019s choir, which the Opera Australia Children\u2019s Chorus delivered with nicely shaded pastel colours in quiet moments and sparkling clarity at the close. Conductor Tahu Matheson unfolded the musical narrative without exaggeration and the Opera Australia Orchestra nurtured the score\u2019s finery with warm sound from horns and lower brass. In the first act Mark Thompson\u2019s set is a claustrophobic cottage which becomes oversized in Act 2 as though the children had fallen asleep hungry after the scolding and all the nonsense no more troubling than a dream. DANCE\n\nSISA-SISA\n\nBankstown Arts Centre, January 23\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The double bill SISA-SISA (Indonesian for \u201cthe remains\u201d or \u201cremnants\u201d) marks the Sydney Festival debut of the extraordinary husband and wife duo Murtala and Alfira O\u2019Sullivan, co-directors of the Indonesian cultural company Suara Dance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComprising two autobiographical solos, SISA-SISA represents long-awaited recognition for the couple, who have spent years channelling their energy into dance troupe choreography. Alfira O\u2019Sullivan in SISA-SISA. Victor Frankowski Both husband and wife possess an artistic maturity that makes its presence felt immediately: the kind that sears with intense honesty and a stage presence earned after only decades of experience. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s work, Jejak & Bisik (which can be translated to \u201ctraces and whispers\u201d), explores O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s life as an ageing female dancer caught in the crosshairs of unrelenting professional demands, motherhood and community leadership, and a traumatic misdiagnosed miscarriage. Alfira and Murtala O\u2019Sullivan in the Sydney Festival show SISA-SISA. Victor Fankowski\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs O\u2019Sullivan changes costumes and fixes her hair on stage, her mobile phone buzzes with voice messages while emails from a management company pop up on-screen. A polite corporate voiceover reads them out: As O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s profession is relegated to \u201cthe multicultural stage\u201d and deemed unsuitable for \u201cmainstream\u201d white Australian audiences, it will be subject to various constraints including a fee reduction. Could she create a dance piece for a conference, sandwiched between the Monday morning speaker and the keynote speaker, designed to keep people awake? Using her community troupe? For less than $500? During a period when she is recovering from reproductive surgery? O\u2019Sullivan, blessed with a striking natural glamour, demonstrates a beautiful sense of embodied theatricality and poise as she communicates this emotional journey. Murtala\u2019s piece, Gelumbang Raya (which can be translated as \u201cthe Great Wave\u201d), is his danced memory of recovering the bodies of victims of the Boxing Day Tsunami. A local of Aceh, Murtala returned after the tsunami as a disaster relief volunteer, working with survivors and \u2014 quite literally \u2014 staring death in the face as he carried thousands of bodies out of the mud. Gelumbang Raya is haunting in its rawness and urgency, performed on a stage strewn with sand and visual projections of tides washing in and out. It incorporates Acehnese body percussion, singing, and the frame drum \u2014 11 of which lie buried in the sand, like lives frozen in time by the tsunami. One of the piece\u2019s final images \u2014 Murtala, lifted upside down in a head stand amidst the sand, singing in a piercing tenor as the drums lie around him \u2014 lands like a rip in your gut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHEATRE\n\nasses.masses\n\nDrama Theatre, Sydney Opera House\n\nJanuary 24, until January 25\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd By the fourth hour, you\u2019ve entered a state of trance. Your communal gaming herd is cheering on a self-elected temporary controller who\u2019s playing a version of Guitar Hero in the Sydney Opera House to help a donkey maximise its fornicating delights. This is Sick Ass, one of many donkey avatars, who\u2019s just reached the Astral Plane (aka donkey heaven) as a casualty in the worker-animal uprising. What began as a peaceful protest against the human overlords\u2019 exploitative machine-first system went horribly wrong, leading to death, displacement and disunification within the movement. Patrons engrossed in the ass\u2019s journey at the Sydney Festival show asses.masses. Your own ass is getting sore. Level complete, you all break for snacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe audience may have thinned after the third interval, with another four hours to go. But those who are spiritually invested for the long haul in this multidisciplinary, multidimensional epic and graphic radical allegory are all in \u2013 and rewarded for their loyalty. Travelling through farm and village, circus and abattoir, nightmare and nirvana; through hundreds of ass puns and inventively obscene animations, while conquering button-mashing challenges and philosophical puzzles, we become a pack immersed through live social experiment in a stunningly rendered universe \u2013 comrades in a common goal towards \u201ctrue progress\u201d, united by the liberating mindset of play. Canadians Patrick Blenkarn and Milton Lim are behind the asses.masses project, brought to Sydney Festival for one weekend, and touring as far as Finland, Istanbul and Chicago next. Conceived with vast ambition, a collectivist sensibility and total nerd passion, it\u2019s a unique animal of modern participatory theatre, using the language of video games and dorm-room humour to tell its staunch and timeless revolutionary tale. The game art is truly dope. The \u201cmaterial world\u201d is built with nostalgia-infused pixels, its textures, dialogue boxes, tessellated realms and soundscapes recalling Legend of Zelda or Pokemon. The \u201castral plane\u201d is of the realism style, transporting us to sublime desert canyons (where donkey souls rave) and rolling infinity pathways (where the player-crowd yells \u201cdon\u2019t do drugs!\u201d when a power-boost orb appears). Classics games such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man are built into the narrative to either create obstacles, or simply offer fun little inconsequential diversions. For example, we spent a gleefully inordinate amount of time in the mines getting the donkey foal avatar (whom we voted to name Bitch Ass) to play a version of Pong called Rocks. Later, another controller has Hard Ass hoof-kick a swarm of riot policeman dead a la Karate Champ. The difficulty level ramps up on our quest, with veteran pros stepping up to earn our thunderous applause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar closer to Animal Farm than Animal Crossing, there are some intentionally lurid depictions of violence, particularly against humans \u2013 from the life-like screams of burning villagers, to a factory worker getting eviscerated by his own meat hook. Most hilariously macabre is a grim, surreal sequence in which Hard Ass has to sacrifice himself many times to create a corpse bridge for/of himself over a bloody trench. Obviously, with scores of people in the room, not everyone gets (or wants) a go at the controller. The majority are basic spectators \u2013 our \u2018agency\u2019 limited to adding to the cacophony of yelled dialogue options and directions, jokes and commentary. More theoretically than actually active, the player-herd moves through cycles of elation and fatigue, agony and ecstasy, frustrated boredom and shared jubilation. The durational aspect can take you to the edge: at one point I found myself cry-laughing at the excessively cautious way a controller was moving a mutinous gang of equines hidden inside packing boxes. During the seventh hour, we spontaneously rose to our feet to sing the \u201csong of ascension\u201d, a donkey funeral dirge. Would I have better enjoyed this marathon on a friend\u2019s sofa, where we could have a more equitable share of the controller, and partake of snacks superior to Doritos and dry vegan buns? Sure. But enjoyment isn\u2019t the only marker of a worthwhile experience. Sometimes you have to endure the discomfort to come out the other side, finding yourself, in some way, new.",

    "text": "Last weekend, China's defence ministry announced that the country's two most senior generals \u2014 Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli \u2014 would be removed from office and placed under investigation for serious disciplinary violations.\n\nZhang had been the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) most senior general since October 2022. He was the highest-ranking military member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China (CCP), the party-state's 24-member executive policy-making body.\n\nZhang was also the senior vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which controls the armed forces.\n\nLiu was the former commander of the PLA's Ground Force and had most recently been in charge of the CMC's Joint Staff Department.\n\nThe reaction to these developments outside China has led to dramatic headlines. A BBC headline initially focused on a \"military in crisis\", while the ABC called it an \"astonishing\" purge that leaves Chinese leader Xi Jinping almost alone at the top of the world's biggest army.\n\nCertainly, the moves were surprising. But so little is known about the internal workings of the CCP's leadership, including Xi's relations with his colleagues in the Politburo, that interpreting these developments is difficult, if not impossible.\n\nREAD MORE What to know about China's major military drills around Taiwan\n\nHere's what we know\n\nFor historical and political reasons, the PLA is an organisation of the CCP. Both fall under the direct purview of Xi, who is chair of the CMC, general secretary of the CCP and president of the country.\n\nThe removal of Zhang and Liu, at least temporarily, leaves military leadership under just Xi and general Zhang Shengmin. Three other members of the CMC have lost their positions since 2024 and haven't been replaced.\n\nThough the Chinese leadership is notoriously opaque, it is clear there have been disciplinary problems within the military in the last few years, particularly related to corruption and procurement in the more technically advanced departments of the PLA. Some two dozen senior military figures have been dismissed or investigated since 2022.\n\nZhang and Liu were fairly recent appointments to even more senior positions. Both were also seen as personal supporters of Xi. The fathers of Xi and Zhang had a close relationship dating back to the early days of the CCP, in the 1930s, before the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\n\nMoreover, the removals of Zhang and Liu happened more quickly than other senior military dismissals of recent years \u2014 and there were fewer warning signs. Both men had appeared in public as recently as a month ago.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Zhang is accused of providing the United States with information about China's nuclear weapons program, alongside allegations of accepting bribes and forming \"political cliques\".\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nPast practice suggests that once a senior figure loses their status or is dismissed \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 their downfall results in accusations of a litany of crimes.\n\nThe Politburo has also seen its share of intense internal politics in the past, though the precise circumstances of such conflicts usually take years to surface.\n\nA good example is the mysterious death of Lin Biao in 1971, another former PLA commander who, at the time, was Mao Zedong's designated successor.\n\nGiven the broader context at play here with the management of the military and the development of government programs in recent years, as well as the claims Zhang and Liu violated \"discipline and the law\", there are two possible explanations for their dismissals.\n\nBoth may have had direct involvement in corruption, taking bribes to appoint officials or ensure contracts for suppliers. It is equally likely they are being held responsible for corruption that has undoubtedly occurred in military procurement under their watch.\n\nThere is also the possibility of a difference of opinion within the CMC and the Politburo on how to deal with corruption, particularly within the military.\n\nXi has repeatedly stressed the importance of the fight against corruption since he became general secretary of the CCP in 2012.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has made this an even more important crusade in the context of the about-to-be-announced 15th Five-year Plan for Economic and Social Development. On 12 January, he designated the issue of corruption as a \"major struggle\" in a speech to China's top anti-corruption agency:\n\n\"Currently, the situation in the fight against corruption remains grave and complex \u2026 We must maintain a high-pressure stance without wavering, resolutely punishing corruption wherever it exists, eliminating all forms of graft, and leaving no place for corrupt elements to hide,\" he said.\n\nTo meet China's developmental goals, he added, the CCP \"must deploy cadres who are truly loyal, reliable, consistent and responsible\".\n\nIt is difficult to see Zhang and Liu or indeed anyone else currently willing or able to challenge Xi. Or, indeed, that Xi might feel immediately threatened by Zhang, Liu or others.\n\nTo that extent, Xi's personal position is neither strengthened nor weakened by these dismissals.\n\nOther analysts have suggested that the disruptions caused by the dismissals could lower Xi's confidence in his military. Some have even said the potential for an invasion of Taiwan has now been lowered.\n\nThe removal of so many leaders may indicate the PLA is now expected to undergo a culture change. At the same time, it would be drawing a very long bow to suggest its military capacity, generally or in relation to Taiwan, has either been strengthened or weakened.\n\nDavid S G Goodman, Director, China Studies Centre, Professor of Chinese Politics, University of Sydney\n\nDavid S G Goodman does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Meanwhile, the trimmed mean \u2014 which strips out volatile items \u2014 also edged higher to 3.3 per cent from 3.2 per cent.\n\nThe RBA's target band for inflation is 2-3 per cent.\n\nDavid Bassanese, chief economist at Betashares, anticipates the central bank will raise the cash rate following next week's meeting, giving banks a green light to raise interest rates.\n\n\"It's probably going to feel the need to rein in demand somewhat, and the way it does that is by raising rates.\"\n\nSource: SBS News\n\nRSM Australia economist Devika Shivadekar said a cash rate increase this year was a matter of when, not if, describing the RBA as \"hawkish\" and \"stern\" in its goal of reducing inflation.\n\n\"Next week's decision in my opinion is a close 55 to 45 in favour of a rate rise, with the RBA potentially opting to move pre-emptively and hike now rather than risk having to tighten more forcibly later,\" she said.\n\nShe said that anything more than a 0.25 percentage point increase, the most common incremental changes in recent years, would be \"overkill\".\n\nHow would repayments increase if rates rise?\n\nA 0.25 percentage point hike, which ANZ and Westpac joined in forecasting on Wednesday, would add about $90 in monthly repayments for an owner-occupier with a $600,000 mortgage.\n\nFor a $750,000 mortgage, an increase of that level would increase repayments by about $112 a month, while those with a $1 million home loan would fork out $150 more.\n\nGiven recent labour market and household spending data has also been running hotter than expected, the upside surprise on inflation is likely to heighten fears of a rate hike at the RBA's meeting.\n\n\"We think the RBA will conclude that demand is running ahead of supply and that an interest rate adjustment would help ensure inflation returns to the target,\" ANZ head of Australian economics Adam Boyton said.\n\nLISTEN TO Surprise jobs report boosts chance of February rate rise SBS News 11:14 English\n\nWestpac chief economist Luci Ellis also expects a February rate rise, but does not think it will be followed with further hikes.\n\nBefore the inflation release, traders were pricing in the chance of a February rate hike at about 60 per cent, after a drop in the unemployment rate heightened the RBA's fears about a lack of spare capacity in the labour market.\n\nImmediately following the release, market-implied odds of a rate hike climbed to more than 70 per cent, senior investment strategist at Global X Marc Jocum said.\n\nJocum believed a hawkish hold remained the most likely scenario for February, \"but the risks around that call are clearly skewed and mounting toward a rate hike\".\n\nThe RBA has not increased the cash rate since November 2023.\n\nWhat pushed inflation higher?\n\nThe rise in the CPI was driven by housing, up 5.5 per cent, followed by food and non-alcoholic beverages, up 3.4 per cent, and recreation and culture, which rose 4.4 per cent, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said.\n\nElectricity costs rose 21.5 per cent in the 12 months to December, largely because of state electricity rebates in Queensland and WA being used up by households.\n\nShivadekar said that some sectors that experienced price increases would have been impacted by seasonal factors.\n\n\"We do know people travel during the school holidays. We know there are Christmas sale periods, so there's more hiring, more temp jobs created,\" she said.\n\n\"It's more seasonal demand than entrenched overheating.\"\n\nBassanese echoed this assessment, saying: \"An increase in things like accommodation, hospitality services, restaurants and takeaways could be a one-off thing, thanks to events like the Ashes [cricket series].\n\n\"We also saw above-average tourist-related spending.\"\n\nThe RBA kept the cash rate unchanged at 3.6 per cent for a third time at its last meeting in December, with governor Michele Bullock all but ruling out further mortgage relief in the new year.\n\n\"I don't think there are interest rate cuts on the horizon for the foreseeable future,\" Bullock said after the last meeting.\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nA report from the Commonwealth Ombudsman has found that Services Australia knowingly broke child support laws for six years.\n\nBack in 2019, the agency identified that its policy of denying payments to parents with less than 35 per cent of care was unlawful.\n\nUnder the law, these parents are entitled to support, but Services Australia refused to enforce it, citing a \"longstanding principle\" that applying the law could result in a parent with little or no care of children receiving payments from the main carer.\n\nOmbudsman Iain Anderson told SBS that since the agency knew it was breaking the law for six years, it should have escalated the issue much sooner.\n\n\"So if a public servant thinks that the law is not working correctly. What they should do is tell people about it. Public servants can't change the law themselves. They need the agreement of ministers, cabinet and parliament, so they've got to escalate it. They've got to say, here's a problem that needs to be fixed, and they can't just pick or choose for themselves which parts of the legislation they're going to follow.\"\n\nMr Anderson says some of this legal non-compliance occurred prior to the Robodebt Royal Commission, and is acknowledging the department has since made efforts to improve its internal culture.\n\nMr Anderson is confirming that at least 16,600 people were affected, with some owed up to $10,000.\n\nHe says while these individuals have been informed that the law was applied incorrectly, the situation is complicated by the fact that those owed money were not the primary caregivers.\n\nAccording to Mr Anderson, there is no doubt the legislation was producing unintended consequences.\n\nIn response, the Ombudsman has made six recommendations, including a proposal to retroactively change the law so parents with less than 35 per cent of care cannot claim support, while simultaneously offering compensation to those already disadvantaged by the agency's past actions.\n\n\"We're talking about child support legislation here. With child support, it's really important that child support money gets paid to the parents who are caring for children. Now the unintended consequences here are some legislative amendments were that the parent who was doing most of the caring actually is required to pay child support to the parent who's not doing much of the caring. So that's a problem, and because it's child support, it needed to be fixed quickly.\"\n\nNational Legal Aid spokesperson Feiyi Zhang is declining to comment on a potential class action lawsuit, but is emphasising that individuals face significant hurdles when seeking legal redress for issues like child support.\n\n\"Yeah, so one of the issues is that we as legal aid commissions can only provide a limited amount of legal advice and very limited legal representation for people who are seeking help with their child support, rights and claims. So at the moment, only 8% of Australian households can actually access legal aid, while the poverty line stands at 13% so we anticipate, in response to this, this finding by the Ombudsman that there will be a significant increase in the number of people who will be seeking advice from us, and that will depend on the resources that we have available, but it's very limited.\"\n\nAccording to Ms Zhang, these administrative failures do more than just strain bank accounts; they trigger a domino effect that can lead vulnerable families into the justice system.\n\n\"I think the priority for us is making sure that Department of Social Services is accountable for the decisions that it makes impacting the people that we work with. People who miss out on government entitlements, who miss out on child support payments, can re enter our services, and the lack of access to the appropriate legal or government rights earlier on in their life can have compounding impacts, and they end up within the legal system, within the justice system, with, you know, worsening impacts on their lives. So it's really important that the government, you know, intervenes.\"\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the agency\u2019s handling of child support has come under fire.\n\nIn a separate investigation handed down last year, the Ombudsman found Services Australia was amplifying financial abuse by failing to enforce payments.\n\nAt the time, $1.9 billion was owed, with the debt affecting mostly mothers, who were disproportionately impacted.\n\nThe report, handed down last year, made eight key recommendations ranging from the urgent recovery of unpaid funds to better tracking of financial abuse within the system.\n\nTerese Edward, a spokesperson from Single Mother Families Australia, says what she calls ' the weaponisation' of the child support system needs to be addressed.\n\n\"So what we've got is a system that allows child support to be weaponised. And it's really simple. An ex partner, a vexatious ex partner, doesn't lodge a tax return in one year, five years, 10 years, there's no ramifications. A provisional or estimated amount is accepted, and then the consequences of that is we have children with an underpayment. We have children who are not receiving that really important money funnel from one parent to another. We need it only to function, not only to provide those necessary funds but also it should be a safe system.\"\n\nServices Australia spokesperson Hank Jongen says the department has already taken a range of steps to improve outcomes, including training for staff to ensure they\u2019re equipped to recognise and support people experiencing financial abuse.\n\nMr Jongen says that the department will implement the recommendations from the Ombudsman report by the end of January.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nPacgold Limited has kept the drill bit busy and the excitement ticking over at its St George gold\u2013antimony project in North Queensland, wrapping up its maiden reverse circulation (RC) drilling program with another set of shallow, high-grade antimony hits. The company says the new results have added weight to the idea that a much larger mineralised system may be lurking below the surface. Gold and stibnite in quartz vein at Pacgold Limited\u2019s St George project in Northern Queensland. The first-pass nine-hole RC campaign, completed late last year, was designed to poke a few holes beneath historic workings at a once-forgotten antimony field that had already been flashing serious promise at surface. While the mineralised trend runs for more than a kilometre, drilling to date has tested just 200 metres of strike and even that light touch has delivered plenty of fireworks. The results from the last seven holes are now in. Two particular drill holes confirmed that antimony-rich quartz veins don\u2019t stop at surface. Standout hits included 1 metre at 12.8 per cent antimony from 41m downhole. A second intercept returned 3m running at 1.6 per cent antimony from 67m and included a richer 1-metre slice grading a stunning 4.4 per cent antimony from 68m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The upside of this vast tenement package is immense.\u2019 Pacgold Limited managing director Matthew Boyes Gold made its presence felt as well, adding extra shine to the story. Hits included a solid 8m grading 0.7g/t gold from 45m downhole and in another drillhole, the bit struck 1m at a steady 1.3g/t gold from 82m. Shallow mineralisation was also intersected, with 7m running at 0.5g/t gold from just 4m downhole in a third hole, including a 2m zone grading 1.2g/t gold from 8m depth. All up, seven of the nine RC holes drilled delivered anomalous antimony or gold - a tidy strike rate for a maiden program that barely scratched the edges of the system. Notably, the quartz veins remain open along strike to the north and south and down dip, leaving plenty of blue sky for follow-up drilling. The nine-hole program totalled 826 metres and intersected multiple north-trending quartz veins hosted in interbedded sandstone and shale, with widespread sericite alteration pointing to a fertile hydrothermal system. Historic records show the area previously produced about 60 tonnes of ore grading a staggering 60 per cent antimony from open pit and shallow underground workings during the 1960\u2019s - proof that the rocks here know how to deliver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd St George isn\u2019t a one-trick pony. The broader geological story shows Pacgold\u2019s tenure sits within a major north-northwest\u2013trending structural corridor that stretches for more than 20 kilometres and hosts multiple additional gold\u2013antimony targets. These include the company\u2019s Fence and Ridgeline gold-antimony prospects. Together with St George, the three prospects form part of a mineralised belt extending for more than 20 kilometres of strike across Pacgold\u2019s tenement package. Pacgold Limited managing director Matthew Boyes said \u201cIntersecting additional high grade antimony numbers confirms we have a large mineralised system which we have only just started to explore. The upside of this vast tenement package is immense, and 2026 is shaping up to be a massive year for our exploration crews.\u201d The timing of these results couldn\u2019t be better. Antimony has been thrust into the global spotlight as a critical mineral thanks to its role in defence, energy storage and advanced manufacturing, while gold prices continue to surge to new highs almost daily, supercharging the economics of any discovery that can grow scale and grade. With the North Queensland wet season temporarily slowing boots-on-the-ground fieldwork and drilling, Pacgold plans to return to St George in the June quarter with an expanded drill plan. The company says it plans to chase extensions beneath historic workings and fan out along the broader corridor to test a suite of high-priority regional targets. With shallow, high-grade antimony confirmed, gold along for the ride and kilometres of fertile ground still untouched, Pacgold looks to have plenty of reasons to be sharpening the drill bits ahead of what shapes as a very busy 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs antimony surges up government agendas and gold prices soar due to geopolitical uncertainty, the drilling at St George appears to be hitting the right rocks at exactly the right time.

Got it Share A A A\n\nAt least three iPhone models are unable to take or make phone calls on the Telstra network, in what is the latest telco glitch that left Australian customers momentarily unable to make Triple Zero emergency calls. By Thursday morning, a day after it first announced the issue, Telstra\u2019s customers still appeared unable to use their own network to call emergency services, with an update from the company stating that such calls would have to rely on rival networks. The iPhone X, which has been affected by the issue, was released in 2017. Michael Nagle The company said that if affected customers saw \u201cSOS calls\u201d appear on their device, they would now be able to make calls to Triple Zero by automatically connecting to an alternative mobile network if available. \u201cIt can take some time (e.g. one minute) for the impacted device to connect to the alternative mobile network when one is available,\u201d Telstra said in an update on Thursday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple issued the software update to the iPhone 12 and other older models on January 26, but iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X users soon began reporting connection issues. Telstra confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that it was investigating an issue with the phones connecting to its network, including to Triple Zero. Loading \u201cWe\u2019re working on this as a priority with Apple and will share updates as we have them,\u201d the company said on its website. \u201cWe recommend customers using these devices delay updating the software on their device until we confirm the issue is resolved.\u201d An Apple spokesperson said that by midday Thursday, it had identified a fix for Telstra customers and would be released in an upcoming software update.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Updated\n\nTelecommunications TPG says person dead after failed Triple Zero call When investigations were underway, Apple initially paused the software update that caused the issue; by Thursday afternoon, all versions of the update except for one \u2013 iOS 16.7.13 \u2013 had been rectified and reissued. The reliability of Triple Zero services has come under scrutiny since a major outage at Optus last year was initially linked to four deaths, though police later clarified the emergency call issue did not contribute to two of the fatalities. The others are under coronial investigation. In that incident, many phones that should have connected to another network to reach Triple Zero when Optus\u2019 service failed were unable to switch. Similar failures separately affected older Samsung phones last year. The Apple update this month was intended to stop that type of problem from happening in other situations to users of its phones. \u201cIn the rare event that these exceptional circumstances affecting mobile operators\u2019 networks were to happen again, some older mobile phones might still encounter the same issue reaching emergency services through an alternate available network,\u201d the company said in a post on its website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSoftware updates are available for the following iPhone and Apple Watch models that might be impacted by this network issue. You are encouraged to update your devices to the latest software version.\u201d One user posted on Reddit that the update had left their phone \u201cbeing near useless\u201d. \u201cEven after trying all of the troubleshooting and calling my carrier, I found that I was only able to connect to Wi-Fi,\u201d the social media user said. \u201cNo calls, no SMS, no data. My phone can only be used on Wi-Fi. \u201cAnd to top it off, it\u2019s even killed the ability to call 000 \u2013 the entire reason the update was released in the first place.\u201d Spokespeople for Optus and TPG, which also operates the Vodafone brand, said the Apple issue was not affecting their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Telecommunications Triple Zero was built for 1960s phones. Can it handle 2025? Carol Bennett, the CEO of Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, said public confidence in the Triple Zero system \u201chas taken a significant hit over the last 12 months\u201d. \u201cWe have seen outages, device compatibility problems, mixed messaging and general confusion,\u201d she said. Bennett noted the Triple Zero custodian had been in place for several months, but said the government must act further to create a \u201cresilient and evolving\u201d emergency communications system, including a national SMS to Triple Zero service as well as digital channels. \u201cIt is a top public safety priority that we strengthen and modernise the Triple Zero system. The chaos we saw last year is bleeding into this year. Enough is enough,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssociate professor Mark Gregory, a telecommunications expert from RMIT University, said vendors, successive governments and the Australian Communications and Media Authority had all dropped the ball on Triple Zero over the past 15 years, and called for regulatory reform. \u201cThere needs to be tightening of the regulations. To ensure that the vendors understand fully what their role is in making handsets available for use by consumers in Australia,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cThere needs to be performance measures within the legislation, and there needs to be penalties. And we need the government to step up and do something about it. But, you know, at the moment, it\u2019s crickets.\u201d Gregory said that changing technologies, such as rolling out upgrades from 4G to 5G, required specific oversight to ensure telcos didn\u2019t break critical infrastructure in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Investigation\n\nTelecommunications The emails that reveal how Optus downplayed the Triple Zero disaster Federal opposition communications spokeswoman Melissa McIntosh said Telstra had urged customers not to install the update until it had been fixed and advised people to find an alternative way to communicate. \u201cOnce again, I am giving the public service announcement on an important issue impacting the safety of our citizens when it should be the Albanese Labor government,\u201d she said in a statement. A spokesman for Communications Minister Anika Wells said Telstra and Apple had advised the government they were working to fix the issue urgently. \u201cPeople affected should contact Telstra as their service provider if they are concerned or have special needs,\u201d the spokesman said.

A large section of the loading bay floor and an adjoining retaining wall collapsed at Toll Group\u2019s healthcare distribution centre in Richlands, west of Brisbane, in late December, forcing the warehouse\u2019s closure over safety concerns. The $10 million custom-designed facility is used by Queensland Health and biotechnology multinational CSL to store and distribute vaccines and pharmaceuticals and was opened in 2023. A structural collapse at Toll\u2019s Richlands warehouse disrupted vaccination supply across Queensland. Toll Group Toll established a temporary storage facility following the collapse, but the incident resulted in delays to vaccine deliveries, including childhood vaccines offered through the National Immunisation Program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Flu season \u2018This is not the record we want to be breaking\u2019: Anti-vax ideology helping flu surge, GPs say A spokesperson for the Australian Medical Association Queensland said it was \u201caware of some practices experiencing difficulty accessing vaccines and has sought an urgent update from Queensland Health\u201d. Queensland Health said service providers should not be concerned about access to vaccine stock. \u201cWe took immediate action to avoid any disruption to vaccine supply following an incident at Toll\u2019s storage facility and Toll have established a temporary site in Victoria to support the Queensland vaccine program,\u201d a Queensland Health spokesperson said. \u201cIncoming orders are being prioritised according to most urgent need and it is anticipated that distribution will normalise soon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQueensland Health said stock remained safely stored with appropriate temperature control until access could be co-ordinated. The department was working with Toll to ensure access to the Richlands site as soon as possible. But the scope of structural damage is significant and will require engineering assessments to determine how and when the warehouse can return to operating as usual, with access to the site closed indefinitely. A CSL spokesman said the damage to the facility had not affected its supply chain given the company primarily focused on flu vaccines, which were not required for at least two months in preparation for the winter period. \u201cThe supply of CSL products to healthcare professionals and patients hasn\u2019t been impacted as we have been able to supply from within our network,\u201d the spokesman said.

Veteran playwright David Williamson uses this to fine comedic effect, taking aim at his favourite subject \u2013 status-obsessed Sydney. This time he skewers how the city\u2019s wealthy garner power and cultural cachet through appointments to boards of arts institutions. Mandy Bishop as Katie with Johnny Nasser as her husband Roger in The Social Ladder. Phil Erbacher Social climber Katie Norrie (Mandy Bishop) wants a seat on one of the most prestigious: the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s fund-raising foundation. She has a plan to win her glittering prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe invites Sydney\u2019s most influential couple to dinner. Pillars of the establishment, Catherine (Sarah Chadwick) and Charles Mallory (Andrew McFarlane) are major art collectors and on every elite cultural board in town. Desperate to impress, Katie has borrowed an Arthur Boyd masterpiece, hired a celebrity chef to cook, and invited a lefty filmmaker friend and his teacher wife to join them. What could go wrong? Pretty much everything \u2013 but no prizes for guessing that. The glee is in watching just how slippery the rungs on this social ladder will be. On a sparse stage, the first three scenes swiftly set up the three couples ahead of the crucial dinner party in this tightly plotted play. Katie has grown up in the Shire and never shaken her working-class accent. Her husband Roger (Johnny Nasser), born into wealth, has little patience for her social ambitions and has a beef with Charles Mallory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew McFarlane as ruthless billionaire Mallory with Sarah Chadwick as his wife Catherine. Phil Erbacher Mallory is a ruthless billionaire; his wife Catherine has a cut-glass English accent that conceals her humble roots. Ben (Matt Minto) and Laura Gregory (Jo Downing) have been dropped from Katie\u2019s social circle for several years and are sceptical of why they\u2019re suddenly back in favour. As the dinner party is poised to get under way, Katie\u2019s home is revealed in its bright, brash glory. The hostess in an eye-popping confection and Catherine in sleek ivory are delicious visual contrasts. Veronique Benett\u2019s pitch-perfect set and costumes are a joy to behold. As the dinner party descends into alcohol-fuelled mayhem, anti-woke Charles clashes with Ben over diversity and unions, with Laura over tax avoidance and with Roger over business dealings. Secrets are disclosed \u2013 not least about that wow painting. Bitterness and recriminations ensue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, too, does some Bollywood dancing. For amid the havoc, much fun is to be had in this light-hearted comedy. Matt Minto, Mandy Bishop and Sarah Chadwick in The Social Ladder. Phil Erbacher The three couples are stock types who argue their positions effectively, rather than fleshed-out characters. But the dialogue is sharp, there are laugh-out-loud lines, and Janine Watson\u2019s brisk direction maintains the pace with her capable cast. Bishop is terrific as the brazen Katie, whose grand plans become smoking ruins along with the roghan josh. Chadwick impresses as the imperious Catherine, as does McFarlane as her shameless old bull of a husband who can\u2019t say no to an income stream. The ending is upbeat, although Roger\u2019s volte-face comes out of the blue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is classic Williamson, replete with witty observations and great one-liners. It tickles the funny bone and pricks the bubble of privilege. THEATRE\n\nGod\u2019s Cowboy\n\nFlight Path Theatre\n\nJanuary 28, until February 21\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605 At some point, I started to wonder if I\u2019d fallen into an alternative universe. Had I hit my head on the way to Flight Path, that quaint little Marrickville theatre with its surprise overhead aircraft crescendos? Had I lost my powers of comprehension? With queer love and sexual trauma the preoccupying themes, this debut play by stage producer Les Solomon resembles a conceptual sequence of soapy non sequiturs, scudding awkwardly into a middle distance. Or, perhaps, a lame steed that could not be brought to water, and so wanders into the desert. God\u2019s Cowboy idled several years in development and really should have remained in purgatory, instead of saddling up for this year\u2019s Mardi Gras.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter (Nathaniel Savy) in a dashing, kink-coded ensemble gifted by Daniel (Max Fernandez). David Hooley Characters describe and behave towards each other in ways that not only don\u2019t make sense, they profoundly baffle. The plot gropes towards a non-collapsible shape. The more provoking scenes, involving intimate boundaries being crossed, are not always discomforting in ways that are productive and justifiable. And the \u2018memory play\u2019 framing device suffers from amnesia, with the middle section seeming to forget that the story began in a fourth-wall-breaking flashback narrated by twins Peter (Nathaniel Savy) and Penny (Sophia Laurantus). When another flashback was deployed didactically at the end, the audience startled. The gist of it all: our young sibling pair are relating to us the time when they were both cast in a play of their own, and so crossed paths with fellow actor Daniel (Max Fernandez), a Midnight Cowboy-inspired gunslinger lead. First of all, it\u2019s odd that Fernandez got the role of this \u2018dark and mysterious\u2019 stranger when the impressively toned and charismatic Savy seems far more suited. But it\u2019s also confusing why either of the twins are drawn to the character of Daniel at all, given his repertoire appears to be making people feel uncomfortable with slimy drawls, snickers and an aggressively cavalier attitude towards sex. Yet, almost in the blink of an eye, we witness the earnestly angelic Peter, a lover of old-timey musicals, fall in love. Somehow, \u201cilliterate f--- nugget\u201d becomes the phrase that breaks the ice and bonds them. Peter had just hurled it at Daniel after (mistakenly) suspecting him of assaulting his sister. And now they\u2019re on the bedroom floor laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenny\u2019s subplot of her own queer romance feels perfunctory and wholly underdeveloped. There\u2019s another character, Demetrius (Tate Wilkinson Alexander), whose function is to prowl around with sly and shady intent. Another bizarre logic connecting events occurs between the two acts. Daniel, a former sex worker and the victim of horrific childhood abuse, has for a split-second been overtaken by the demons of his past, and turned monstrous himself when Peter is at his most vulnerable. Peter initially won\u2019t even talk to him. Then he\u2019s performing a gorgeous balletic dance for him. Then he\u2019s insisting Daniel meet his parents. There is another scene in which we see Daniel in the play-within-a-play monologuing about how God wants us to fornicate; to be unashamed of our \u201cmanacondas\u201d and \u201cpenis fly traps\u201d. The coup de grace at the end is a sentimental and improbable callback to Peter\u2019s favourite movie, Carousel. At last, it was over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOPERA\n\nHansel & Gretel\n\nOpera Australia, Joan Sutherland Theatre, Opera House\n\nJanuary 27, until February 25\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Sydney rejected the composer Engelbert Humperdinck when he applied to become the first director of the Conservatorium in 1914. The fact that Australia had gone to war with Germany just after he submitted his application might have had something to do with it. But Sydney has been more receptive to Humperdinck\u2019s most famous work, Hansel & Gretel as demonstrated by the warm audience reception for this revival by Claudia Osborne of the 1992 production by one of Opera Australia\u2019s best-loved and most frequently revived directors, the late Elijah Moshinsky. Stacey Alleaume as Gretel and Margaret Plummer as Hansel out front of the gingerbread house. Carlita Sari Photo Humperdinck\u2019s achievement was to combine the simplicity of easily memorable, folk-like melodies with harmonic sophistication and an ability to develop musical ideas without overworking them. With a predominantly female cast (there is only one male role) and a children\u2019s chorus, the sound-world is bright, leavened with richer and darker colours by finely-crafted orchestration. Whether the Grimms\u2019 story cuts through with today\u2019s young people I am unsure, but, in the absence of social media, one has to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMargaret Plummer (Hansel) and Stacey Alleaume (Gretel) drive the action with childish naughtiness and deft musical finesse. Plummer creates the obnoxiousness of little boys with gentle humour and sings with a voice of crimson depth and clarity. Alleaume\u2019s Gretel darts with playful mischief, fine filigree and silvery vocal delight. In Moshinsky\u2019s conception, the mother, Gertrud, in the libretto by Adelheid Wette (Humperdinck\u2019s sister), becomes a harassed scolding stepmother (thus enabling a moment of poignancy in the dream sequence of Act 2). Margaret Plummer as Hansel, Stacey Alleaume as Gretel and Helen Sherman as Stepmother. Carlita Sari Photo Helen Sherman projected the Stepmother\u2019s role firmly, injecting stridency into the sound when the children were particularly irritating. Shane Lowrencev sang the father\u2019s rollicking tipsy entrance song with robust tone and carried the role with lusty flexibility of line. Jane Ede was a fearsome Witch, singing with ringing clarity so that the voice lingered in the head like the foreboding laughter of an unfavourite great aunt. Shikara Ringdahl sang the Sandman\u2019s song with unassuming simplicity. Kathryn Williams as Dew Fairy with some of the troupe. Carlita Sari Photo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKathryn Williams\u2019 cameo as a clear-voiced Dew Fairy was supported by the clumsy awkwardness of a ballet-school troupe. Humperdinck subtly subverts the expectation of a surging operatic peroration by giving the final apotheosis to a children\u2019s choir, which the Opera Australia Children\u2019s Chorus delivered with nicely shaded pastel colours in quiet moments and sparkling clarity at the close. Conductor Tahu Matheson unfolded the musical narrative without exaggeration and the Opera Australia Orchestra nurtured the score\u2019s finery with warm sound from horns and lower brass. In the first act Mark Thompson\u2019s set is a claustrophobic cottage which becomes oversized in Act 2 as though the children had fallen asleep hungry after the scolding and all the nonsense no more troubling than a dream. DANCE\n\nSISA-SISA\n\nBankstown Arts Centre, January 23\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The double bill SISA-SISA (Indonesian for \u201cthe remains\u201d or \u201cremnants\u201d) marks the Sydney Festival debut of the extraordinary husband and wife duo Murtala and Alfira O\u2019Sullivan, co-directors of the Indonesian cultural company Suara Dance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComprising two autobiographical solos, SISA-SISA represents long-awaited recognition for the couple, who have spent years channelling their energy into dance troupe choreography. Alfira O\u2019Sullivan in SISA-SISA. Victor Frankowski Both husband and wife possess an artistic maturity that makes its presence felt immediately: the kind that sears with intense honesty and a stage presence earned after only decades of experience. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s work, Jejak & Bisik (which can be translated to \u201ctraces and whispers\u201d), explores O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s life as an ageing female dancer caught in the crosshairs of unrelenting professional demands, motherhood and community leadership, and a traumatic misdiagnosed miscarriage. Alfira and Murtala O\u2019Sullivan in the Sydney Festival show SISA-SISA. Victor Fankowski\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs O\u2019Sullivan changes costumes and fixes her hair on stage, her mobile phone buzzes with voice messages while emails from a management company pop up on-screen. A polite corporate voiceover reads them out: As O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s profession is relegated to \u201cthe multicultural stage\u201d and deemed unsuitable for \u201cmainstream\u201d white Australian audiences, it will be subject to various constraints including a fee reduction. Could she create a dance piece for a conference, sandwiched between the Monday morning speaker and the keynote speaker, designed to keep people awake? Using her community troupe? For less than $500? During a period when she is recovering from reproductive surgery? O\u2019Sullivan, blessed with a striking natural glamour, demonstrates a beautiful sense of embodied theatricality and poise as she communicates this emotional journey. Murtala\u2019s piece, Gelumbang Raya (which can be translated as \u201cthe Great Wave\u201d), is his danced memory of recovering the bodies of victims of the Boxing Day Tsunami. A local of Aceh, Murtala returned after the tsunami as a disaster relief volunteer, working with survivors and \u2014 quite literally \u2014 staring death in the face as he carried thousands of bodies out of the mud. Gelumbang Raya is haunting in its rawness and urgency, performed on a stage strewn with sand and visual projections of tides washing in and out. It incorporates Acehnese body percussion, singing, and the frame drum \u2014 11 of which lie buried in the sand, like lives frozen in time by the tsunami. One of the piece\u2019s final images \u2014 Murtala, lifted upside down in a head stand amidst the sand, singing in a piercing tenor as the drums lie around him \u2014 lands like a rip in your gut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHEATRE\n\nasses.masses\n\nDrama Theatre, Sydney Opera House\n\nJanuary 24, until January 25\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd By the fourth hour, you\u2019ve entered a state of trance. Your communal gaming herd is cheering on a self-elected temporary controller who\u2019s playing a version of Guitar Hero in the Sydney Opera House to help a donkey maximise its fornicating delights. This is Sick Ass, one of many donkey avatars, who\u2019s just reached the Astral Plane (aka donkey heaven) as a casualty in the worker-animal uprising. What began as a peaceful protest against the human overlords\u2019 exploitative machine-first system went horribly wrong, leading to death, displacement and disunification within the movement. Patrons engrossed in the ass\u2019s journey at the Sydney Festival show asses.masses. Your own ass is getting sore. Level complete, you all break for snacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe audience may have thinned after the third interval, with another four hours to go. But those who are spiritually invested for the long haul in this multidisciplinary, multidimensional epic and graphic radical allegory are all in \u2013 and rewarded for their loyalty. Travelling through farm and village, circus and abattoir, nightmare and nirvana; through hundreds of ass puns and inventively obscene animations, while conquering button-mashing challenges and philosophical puzzles, we become a pack immersed through live social experiment in a stunningly rendered universe \u2013 comrades in a common goal towards \u201ctrue progress\u201d, united by the liberating mindset of play. Canadians Patrick Blenkarn and Milton Lim are behind the asses.masses project, brought to Sydney Festival for one weekend, and touring as far as Finland, Istanbul and Chicago next. Conceived with vast ambition, a collectivist sensibility and total nerd passion, it\u2019s a unique animal of modern participatory theatre, using the language of video games and dorm-room humour to tell its staunch and timeless revolutionary tale. The game art is truly dope. The \u201cmaterial world\u201d is built with nostalgia-infused pixels, its textures, dialogue boxes, tessellated realms and soundscapes recalling Legend of Zelda or Pokemon. The \u201castral plane\u201d is of the realism style, transporting us to sublime desert canyons (where donkey souls rave) and rolling infinity pathways (where the player-crowd yells \u201cdon\u2019t do drugs!\u201d when a power-boost orb appears). Classics games such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man are built into the narrative to either create obstacles, or simply offer fun little inconsequential diversions. For example, we spent a gleefully inordinate amount of time in the mines getting the donkey foal avatar (whom we voted to name Bitch Ass) to play a version of Pong called Rocks. Later, another controller has Hard Ass hoof-kick a swarm of riot policeman dead a la Karate Champ. The difficulty level ramps up on our quest, with veteran pros stepping up to earn our thunderous applause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar closer to Animal Farm than Animal Crossing, there are some intentionally lurid depictions of violence, particularly against humans \u2013 from the life-like screams of burning villagers, to a factory worker getting eviscerated by his own meat hook. Most hilariously macabre is a grim, surreal sequence in which Hard Ass has to sacrifice himself many times to create a corpse bridge for/of himself over a bloody trench. Obviously, with scores of people in the room, not everyone gets (or wants) a go at the controller. The majority are basic spectators \u2013 our \u2018agency\u2019 limited to adding to the cacophony of yelled dialogue options and directions, jokes and commentary. More theoretically than actually active, the player-herd moves through cycles of elation and fatigue, agony and ecstasy, frustrated boredom and shared jubilation. The durational aspect can take you to the edge: at one point I found myself cry-laughing at the excessively cautious way a controller was moving a mutinous gang of equines hidden inside packing boxes. During the seventh hour, we spontaneously rose to our feet to sing the \u201csong of ascension\u201d, a donkey funeral dirge. Would I have better enjoyed this marathon on a friend\u2019s sofa, where we could have a more equitable share of the controller, and partake of snacks superior to Doritos and dry vegan buns? Sure. But enjoyment isn\u2019t the only marker of a worthwhile experience. Sometimes you have to endure the discomfort to come out the other side, finding yourself, in some way, new.",
