    "text": "US President Donald Trump 's Department of Government Efficiency has disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, ending an initiative launched with fanfare as a symbol of Trump's pledge to slash the government's size but which critics say delivered few measurable savings.\n\n\"That doesn't exist,\" Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about DOGE's status.\n\nIt is no longer a \"centralised entity,\" Kupor added, in the first public comments from the Trump administration on the end of DOGE.\n\nElon Musk holds up a chainsaw he received from Argentina's President Javier Milei, right, as they arrive to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025, in Oxon Hill, Md. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (AP)\n\nThe agency, set up in January, made dramatic forays across Washington in the early months of Trump's second term to rapidly shrink federal agencies, cut their budgets or redirect their work to Trump priorities. The OPM, the federal government's human resources office, has since taken over many of DOGE's functions, according to Kupor and documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\nAt least two prominent DOGE employees are now involved with the National Design Studio, a new body created through an executive order signed by Trump in August. That body is headed by Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb, and Trump's order directed him to beautify government websites.\n\nGebbia was part of billionaire Elon Musk's DOGE team while DOGE employee Edward Coristine, nicknamed \"Big Balls\", encouraged followers on his X account to apply to join.\n\nThe fading away of DOGE is in sharp contrast to the government-wide effort over months to draw attention to it, with Trump, his advisers and cabinet secretaries posting about it on social media. Musk, who led DOGE initially, regularly touted its work on his X platform and at one point brandished a chainsaw to advertise his efforts to cut government jobs.\n\n\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk said, holding the tool above his head at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, in February.\n\nDOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditures, but it was impossible for outside financial experts to verify that because the unit did not provide detailed public accounting of its work.\n\n\"President Trump was given a clear mandate to reduce waste, fraud and abuse across the federal government, and he continues to actively deliver on that commitment,\" said White House spokeswoman Liz Huston in an email to Reuters.\n\nCEO of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk leaves the stage holding a chainsaw after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort Hotel And Convention Center on February 20, 2025 in Oxon Hill, Maryland. The annual four-day gathering brings together conservative U.S. lawmakers, international leaders, media personalities and businessmen to discuss and champion conservative ideas. Argentinian President Javier Milei gifted M (Getty)\n\nTrump officials have been signalling DOGE's demise\n\nTrump administration officials have not openly said that DOGE no longer exists, even after Musk's public feud with Trump in May. Musk has since left Washington.\n\nTrump and his team have nevertheless signalled its demise in public since this summer, even though the US president signed an executive order earlier in his term decreeing that DOGE would last through July 2026.\n\nIn statements to reporters, Trump often talks about DOGE in the past tense. Acting DOGE Administrator Amy Gleason, whose background is in healthcare tech, formally became an adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy in March, according to a court filing, in addition to her role with DOGE. Her public statements have largely focused on her HHS role.\n\nRepublican-led states, including Idaho and Florida, meanwhile are creating local entities similar to DOGE.\n\nA government-wide hiring freeze - another hallmark of DOGE - is also over, Kupor said.\n\nTrump on his first day in office barred federal agencies from bringing on new employees, with exceptions for positions his team deemed necessary to enforce immigration laws and protect public safety. He later said DOGE representatives must approve any other exceptions, adding that agencies should hire \"no more than one employee for every four\" that depart.\n\n\"There is no target around reductions\" anymore, Kupor said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks after meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Nov. 21, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP)\n\nFormer DOGE employees move on to new roles\n\nDOGE staff have also taken on other roles in the administration. Most prominent is Gebbia, whom Trump tasked with improving the \"visual presentation\" of government websites.\n\nSo far, his design studio has launched websites to recruit law enforcement officers to patrol Washington, DC, and advertise the president's drug pricing program. Gebbia declined an interview with Reuters via a spokesperson.\n\nZachary Terrell, part of the DOGE team given access to government health systems in the early days of Trump's second term, is now chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services. Rachel Riley, who had the same access according to court filings, is now chief of the Office of Naval Research, according to the office's website.\n\nElon Musk flashes his T-shirt that reads \"DOGE\" to the media as he walks on South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, March 9, 2025 (AP)\n\nJeremy Lewin, who helped Musk and the Trump administration dismantle the US Agency for International Development, now oversees foreign assistance at the State Department, according to the agency's web site.\n\nMusk shortly after Trump's election said he had a mandate to \"delete the mountain\" of government regulations. He made undoing government regulations and remaking the government with AI two key tenets of DOGE, in addition to eliminating federal government jobs.\n\nThe administration is still working toward slashing regulations. The White House budget office has tasked Scott Langmack, who was DOGE's representative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, with creating custom AI applications to pore through US regulations and determine which ones to eliminate, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, has reappeared in Washington. This week, he attended a White House dinner for Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",

    "text": "Concerns about an AI bubble have been simmering for at least a year and a half. Nvidia's incredibly strong earnings this past week tried to put those fears to bed. It may not have been enough.\n\nNvidia on Wednesday posted sales and profits up more than 60 per cent year-on-year, stronger than Wall Street had projected. CEO Jensen Huang said \"sales are off the charts\". And the company expects fourth quarter revenue of about $US65 billion ($100 billion), once again ahead of Wall Street's projections.\n\nNvidia executives said these results, along with growth from other major AI players and the billions being poured into AI infrastructure, indicate that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.\n\nREAD MORE: Education minister calls out prestigious school over leaked document about students\n\nJensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO, at a Q&A session during the APEC CEO summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. (Getty)\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Huang said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"\n\nSome Wall Street analysts agree. But the wider market is not yet convinced: After briefly ticking up on Thursday morning following Nvidia's report, the chipmaker's shares (NVDA) dipped back into the red. They closed Friday down 1 per cent, although the stock remains up 29 per cent from the start of this year.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia answered a lot of questions about where the industry stands right now, but it may take more to shift the overall AI narrative.\n\nNot to burst your bubble\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company anticipates $US3 trillion ($4.65 trillion) to $US4 trillion ($6.2 trillion) in annual AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, adding that demand \"continues to exceed our expectations\". Already, tech giants are expected to pour $US400 billion into AI-related capital expenditures this year, to meet what they say is growing demand for AI and cloud services but also to avoid falling behind industry rivals.\n\nNvidia has every reason to try to reassure investors \u2014 expectations for the company are sky-high after nearly two years of astronomical growth. And many look to the chipmaker as a bellwether for the overall tech industry.\n\nEven as Silicon Valley tries to figure out the business model for generative AI, Nvidia has a big role to fill in the existing tech services people use every day, Huang said. That could help insulate Nvidia even if returns from new AI applications are smaller than expected or take longer to arrive than planned.\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and others at the Saudi Investment Forum. (AP)\n\n\"The world has a massive investment in non-AI software, from data processing to science and engineering simulations, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in cloud computing spend each year.\" Much of the infrastructure powering that software has transitioned from running on older CPU chips to Nvidia's GPUs, the chips known for running AI tools, Huang said.\n\nKress also took the unusual step of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker's partners' recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to \"more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads\". Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $US7 billion in annual revenue this year. And Salesforce's engineering team is 30 per cent more efficient now that it's using AI for coding, she said, \ufeffamong a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.\n\nNvidia isn't the only one arguing that AI bubble concerns may be exaggerated.\n\n\"The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision shows the AI Revolution is NOT a Bubble\u2026instead its Year 3 of a 10-year build out of this 4th Industrial Revolution in our view,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in emailed commentary.\n\nKing Charles III presents the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Jensen Huang. (Getty)\n\nBrian Colello, senior equity analyst at investment research company Morningstar, said he doesn't \"see many signs to suggest that 2026 will be a weak year for Nvidia in any way\" and sees the bubble fears weighing on the company's stock as a \"buying opportunity\".\n\nFears remain\n\nBut despite those strong results, it appears the stock market may not be ready to relax just yet.\n\nQuestions remain about whether tech firms will maintain their massive spending on AI infrastructure, especially as Nvidia has invested in key, unprofitable customers such as OpenAI and Anthropic. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar also raised alarms earlier this month when she suggested that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are incurring to build AI infrastructure. Some took her comments as a sign OpenAI may struggle to afford its commitments, although the company later tried to walk back the statement.\n\nAnd while Nvidia likely has enough customers even if a bubble burst causes some casualties among AI firms, investors may still be worried about what a downturn or even a slowdown could mean for the larger market.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Huang said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\" (Getty)\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, said questions about the sustainability of Big Tech's infrastructure spending spree and Nvidia's circular funding deals were not \"put to rest\" with its latest report. Instead, they may just be \"punted\" to the next quarter.",

    "text": "Australians who share AI deepfakes of another person without that person's consent could be sued or face steep fines, under a new proposal before federal parliament today.\n\nIndependent senator David Pocock, who is introducing the bill, said the government was yet to respond to rapid advances in the field of AI, and urgent action was needed.\n\n\"I'm concerned that the government has dropped the ball,\" Senator Pocock told the ABC.\n\n\"Currently, unless a deepfake is sexually explicit, there's very little that you can do as an Australian.\"\n\nHe said Australians lacked \"basic safeguards\" against having their likeness copied and used for scams, commercial exploitation, disinformation and a range of other purposes.\n\n\"This bill would put into legislation that your face, voice and likeness is yours,\" he said.\n\nDavid Pocock says Australians lack \"basic safeguards\" against having their face and voice copied without permission. (ABC News: Berge Breiland)\n\nThe proposal seeks to add a dedicated complaints framework to the Online Safety Act, granting the eSafety Commissioner powers to demand deepfake removals and issue immediate fines.\n\nUnder the changes, individuals who share a non-consensual deepfake could be fined $165,000 up-front, while companies that fail to comply with a removal notice could pay as much as $825,000.\n\nAs well as the initial fine, individuals caught sharing non-consensual deepfakes could also be hit with a second fine for ignoring removal notices.\n\nAdditionally, proposed changes to the Privacy Act would allow Australians to bring civil lawsuits and sue perpetrators directly for financial compensation.\n\nUnder Senator Pocock's proposal, the victim would not have to prove they had suffered financially in order to bring a case, in recognition of the emotional harm caused by deepfakes.\n\n\"As humans \u2014 our likeness, our face, our voice, our mannerisms \u2014 that's a big part of who we are,\" he said.\n\n\" To me, this seems like a bit of a no-brainer. You should own your face. \"\n\nThe bill seeks to grant the eSafety Commissioner new powers to demand deepfake removals and issue immediate fines. (ABC News: Abbey Haberecht)\n\nThe bill also contained important limits, Senator Pocock said.\n\nIt would carve out uses such as journalism, satire, and good faith uses by law enforcement, with similar exemptions and defences to defamation law, and an additional exemption for children.\n\nThe bill was also designed with the goal of sparing people who share non-consensual deepfakes without realising it, while still catching out those who do so knowingly or recklessly.\n\n\"We are now living in a world where increasingly anyone can create a deepfake and use it however they want,\" Senator Pocock said.\n\nLoading...\n\nLast year, the crossbencher created AI-generated videos of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and then-opposition leader Peter Dutton ahead of the election, to highlight how easily deepfakes could distort political debate.\n\nHe said the changes proposed in his bill would also apply to political campaigns.\n\n\"We have to draw a line in the sand and say, this is not on \u2014 you cannot deepfake someone without their consent,\" he said.\n\nCrossbench moves on AI as government mulls response\n\nSenator Pocock's bill is not the only effort from the crossbench to tackle AI harms, fuelled by a sense that the government has fallen behind.\n\nIn July, independent MP Kate Chaney introduced a private members' bill to criminalise AI apps and tools that generate child sexual abuse material.\n\nBill to criminalise AI child abuse apps to be introduced Independent MP Kate Chaney is set to introduce a bill to criminalise the use of AI tools purpose-built to create child sexual abuse material.\n\n\"I spoke to the attorney-general's office, and there was an acknowledgement that, yeah, there probably is an issue here. But still, we've seen no action on it,\" she said.\n\nThe government passed a law in August 2024 to criminalise sharing non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes, although it did not criminalise the act of creating such material.\n\nMs Chaney and Senator Pocock said there was now an urgent need for far broader protections beyond the issue of sexualised deepfakes.\n\n\"The crossbench is stepping up here because the government has been missing in action,\" Senator Pocock said.\n\n\"Talking to Australians, they're concerned about the misuse of AI,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Ms Chaney raised similar concerns about the lack of protections, calling for Australia to establish its own AI Safety Institute.\n\n\"The US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Singapore all have an equivalent. Australia has supported the idea of them but has not yet actually taken action on putting one forward,\" she said.\n\n\" We can't afford to sit around twiddling our thumbs wondering what to do about AI while it is changing so rapidly. \"\n\nKate Chaney says Australia \"can't afford to sit around twiddling our thumbs\" on AI. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nThe government has been considering its wider policy response to AI after mothballing a draft proposal for specific AI regulation, driven by the previous minister for industry and innovation, Ed Husic.\n\nLabor's rhetoric shifted in the middle of the year to instead focus on the economic promise of AI, as the Productivity Commission called for AI laws to be \"a last resort\".\n\nIn August, new minister Tim Ayres told the ABC the government was not \"rushing\" towards a regulatory response, and was waiting on the outcome of a review due at the end of 2025.\n\n\"I want to make sure that the government makes good decisions here \u2026 to deliver the right outcome,\" he said.\n\nSenator Pocock said the government began consultation on AI two years ago and since then had done \"absolutely nothing with it\".\n\n\"At the same time \u2026 swallowing the lines from big AI companies who are promising the world in terms of productivity, but not actually talking about the very real risks,\" he said.",

(ABC Goldfields: Macey Turner)\n\n\"We were a little bit worried \u2026 we put a lot of investment in this place, a massive investment,\" Mr Galati said as hundreds of residents lined up for last Thursday's official opening.\n\nSince 1998, a total of 19 Spudshed stores have opened, selling directly from the Galati family farms, which are spread across WA from Kununurra in the north to Manjimup in the south.\n\nHundreds of residents lined up for the opening of the new Kalgoorlie Spudshed supermarket. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nIt represents new competition for the giant duopoly of Coles and Woolworths amid a cost-of-living crisis, a decade after Mr Galati went to war with the now-defunct Potato Marketing Corporation.\n\nBut the mining city's inland location was no small logistical challenge for the sleeveless entrepreneur, who spent five years weighing up his expansion into Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\n\n\"I first came here five years ago and I really like the place,\" he said.\n\n\"So many people I have spoken to came here for a year or two, but they're still here 20 years later, so that's what made me think \u2026 it really resonated with me and here we are five years later.\"\n\nTony Galati speaking to customers at the Kalgoorlie-Boulder opening. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nMigrant workers did hard yards\n\nMr Galati's business empire has grown from humble beginnings. His Sicilian parents started a 2-hectare market garden in the 1960s in Spearwood in Perth's southern suburbs.\n\nIt is a familiar road walked by many Italian migrant families who arrived in WA post-World War II, including those who ventured inland to the Goldfields.\n\nLoading...\n\nBy the 1950s, Kalgoorlie-Boulder was home to at least 35 market gardens, supplying fresh produce to markets.\n\nThe city's last market garden, owned by the Trasimeno family who migrated from Italy in 1955, closed in 2003.\n\nOn the possibility of restarting a once-thriving agriculture industry, Mr Galati said he would support any local business that started growing produce in Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\n\n\"Absolutely, 100 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"Actually, if we find any decent water we might even do that ourselves.\n\n\"We could grow produce here. The soil is really good, we just need fresh water. Water is the key.\"\n\nKalgoorlie-Boulder's fresh water supply today continues to be piped 566 kilometres via the 122-year-old Goldfields water supply scheme, built by WA's first engineer-in-chief, CY O'Connor, during the 1890s gold rush.\n\nKalgoorlie-Boulder was home to at least 35 market gardens during the 1950s. (Supplied: Marie Genovese)\n\nFamily ties run deep\n\nPerth retiree Frank Genovese, 75, said his father, Alfio, arrived in Australia in the late 1930s before World War II and eventually settled in Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\n\n\"He was told get yourself into primary industry or you'll be interned because of the war, so that's why he got into market gardens and he did that until he retired in 1969,\" he said.\n\n\"There was no air freight or refrigeration in those days, so Kalgoorlie was completely self sufficient with all of its perishable produce.\"\n\nHe remembers getting up early before school to cut cauliflower or lettuce on the day it went to market, and the horse and plough used to maintain the fields until machinery was introduced in the 1960s.\n\nTrento and Maria Trasimeno operated a market garden on Emin Street in Kalgoorlie from 1958 until 2003. (Supplied: Marie Genovese)\n\nMr Genovese's wife, Marie, was the daughter of Italian migrants, Trento and Maria Trasimeno, who ran market gardens in Kalgoorlie for 45 years until they retired to Perth in 2003.\n\n\"The soils were very rich. We fertilised the soils with waste from the abattoirs and grew everything organically, sustainably,\" Mr Genovese said.\n\n\"Water was the whole secret to life in Kalgoorlie, from the days of CY O'Connor onwards.\n\n\"The vegetables, everything was grown in Kalgoorlie during my young years. We consumed Kalgoorlie product all the way through.\"\n\nA Kalgoorlie Miner newspaper article from 2003 when Trento and Maria Tarismeno retired to Perth.

(Supplied: State Library of WA)\n\n\"Tony's got the resources, he could do it, he's got the money and he's smart,\" Mr Borromei said.\n\n\"It would be pretty expensive to set it up properly, but honestly I could never see that happening because I don't think it would be worth his while.\n\n\"You've got places like the Ord River in the Kimberley with thousands of acres, whereas I don't see the land available to set something up of scale to make it a viable proposition.\"\n\nThe Kalgoorlie City Markets circa 1902. (Supplied: State Library of WA)\n\nMr Genovese agreed, saying times had changed in Kalgoorlie-Boulder and market gardens were likely an industry lost to the past.\n\n\"It's a hard job, long hours, hot, sweaty, and the pay does not come close to up north in the mines when you can make $100,000 a year,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't a 40-hour week, this was people totally dedicated to progressing themselves and their children to a future, because they came here with nothing.\n\n\"You'd need to find the right soils, allocate water from the pipeline.

    "text": "In Canowindra in central-west NSW, winemaker Sam Statham has noticed a trend that has nothing to do with price or palate.\n\nThe co-owner of Rosnay Organic Farm said there was a distinct move towards environmentally conscious wine consumption.\n\n\"I'm definitely seeing young people interested in organic wine \u2026 young people with little young families,\" Mr Statham said.\n\n\"I think that's probably hit them like a truck, the realisation that the next generation is coming through and they've got to do the best they can for them.\"\n\nSam and Simone Statham in their cellar door at Rosnay Organics, Canowindra. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nAccording to data group IWSR, which monitors beverage trends across the globe, organic wine consumption in Australia grew by 60 per cent between 2020 and 2024.\n\nIn the same timeframe, national total wine declined by 15 per cent, meaning organic wine accounted for 4 per cent of all wine consumed in Australia in 2024.\n\nRosnay Organics, which also grows olives, has been certified organic since 1998. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nAnthony Saliba, a professor of psychology at Charles Sturt University and has been researching consumer behaviour for 25 years.\n\nHe said millennial and gen Z customers had a greater awareness of environmental and ethical practices.\n\n\"You've got newer, younger mindsets and practices, so some of the winemakers are just wanting to try these things out a bit more,\" Professor Saliba said.\n\nHe said less heavy wines, with a lower alcohol content, such as p\u00e9tillant naturel (p\u00e9t nat), were attractive to younger consumers.\n\n\"One of the stickier factors around choice for younger people is lower alcohol and lighter styles.\"\n\nAnthony Saliba says younger consumers tend to be more aware of environmental factors. (Supplied: Anthony Saliba)\n\nSustainable winemaking\n\nSustainability is another key factor in the choices made by customers, according to research organisation Wine Australia, which found 62 per cent of wine drinkers had a \"high connection to sustainability\".\n\nNSW Wine Industry Association executive officer Matthew Jessop said the trend towards organic wine was good news for the state.\n\n\"If you look across all of our regions, there are lots of organic producers but there are also lots of people that are farming their properties regeneratively or biodynamically, being good to the earth,\" he said.\n\nOrganic wine consumption in Australia grew by 60 per cent between 2020 and 2024. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nMr Jessop said the farming practices had been around for decades, but the uptake from consumers took time.\n\n\"Just take a region like Orange, two of the biggest producers there, Seesaw and Tamburlaine \u2026 both of them are organic and have been for quite some time,\" he said.\n\nBecoming organic\n\nIn Australia, wine grape growers can become certified organic, meaning the entire process from vine to bottle meets strict standards that are regularly checked; however not all organic wines have this label.\n\nMr Statham's operation was organically certified in 1998.\n\nSam Statham's wines are certified as organic. (ABC Central West: Emily Middleton)\n\nHe said it was not so much about the final product being chemical-free, but rather the process and management plan.\n\n\"It's about demonstrating that you actually have tools in your toolbox to deal with the problems that you've got, so they can feel assured that you're not going to be tempted to reach for some pesticides, fungicides and herbicides,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to use chemicals \u2026 and I don't want to be paying other people to use chemicals and be exposed to chemicals.\"",

    "text": "A stoush over the safety of Melbourne's Metro Tunnel has escalated, with Victoria's firefighters union asking the national rail safety authority to assess the validity of accreditation given to run services in the underground network.\n\nBut the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR) and other stakeholders have strongly refuted claims the Metro Tunnel's emergency response systems are unsafe, saying it supports the opening of the tunnel in less than a week.\n\nThe United Firefighters Union (UFU) has reported all Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV) radios failed to connect to the antenna systems used by emergency services when an unknown number of them were tested in the tunnel in mid-November.\n\nIt claimed 6,000 portable radios used by FRV would need to be reprogrammed by Telstra and re-tested.\n\nThat process could take more than a month, the union said. The tunnel's first passenger services are due to run on Sunday.\n\nAs well as the alleged radio issues, the UFU claimed operator Metro Trains Melbourne (MTM) failed to carry out required consultation with the union as part of its safety accreditation to operate services in the tunnel.\n\nUnion secretary Peter Marshall wrote to the rail safety regulator questioning the validity of Metro Train's permit to operate in the Metro Tunnel.\n\nIn a copy of a letter to the ONRSR seen by the ABC, the UFU also alleged underground breathing equipment was outdated and non-operational, there were problems with emergency vehicles used to travel along the tunnel's rail tracks, that Metro Trains staff needed better understanding of fire indication panel operations and that there was insufficient atmospheric monitoring for smoke or toxic gasses.\n\nIt said it had obtained legal advice that failing to consult with the union rendered Metro Train's safety plan invalid and that it was a criminal offence to run rail services without that accreditation.\n\n\"When we plan public transport, we should plan for public safety,\" UFU Secretary Peter Marshall said in a statement.\n\nVictorian infrastructure in the spotlight The Victorian government has defended the safety of the soon-to-be-opened West Gate Tunnel as a visit from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese coincided with key Metro Tunnel and Suburban Rail Loop updates.\n\n\"In their haste to open infrastructure, the government has abandoned safety altogether.\n\n\"They have pushed communications testing to the last minute, only to find nearly every radio firefighters depend on has failed.\"\n\nBut the ONRSR said it had been provided detailed evidence of consultation between MTM and FRV, including on the issue of radio systems in the Metro Tunnel.\n\n\"Modifications have been made, including the implementation of additional relays in all cross passages of the tunnel,\" a spokesperson from the regulator said.\n\nThe regulator also said it had been issued with a copy of a \"Letter of No Objection\" that FRV sent to MTM to indicate its support for the opening of the tunnel.\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan says the union's claims are wrong. (ABC News)\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan was asked about the issue at a media event with Metro Trains CEO Raymond O'Flaherty at Parkville Station on Monday morning.\n\n\"The claims that have been made by the union today are wrong,\" Ms Allan said.\n\n\"And they've also been clearly rejected by the rail safety regulator who is the expert on this matter.\"\n\nMr O'Flaherty said the tunnels had state-of-the-art emergency systems.\n\n\"Fire Rescue Victoria has carried out a lot of tests of the systems, the regulator is satisfied \u2026 everything is safe and we're actually ready to go.\"\n\nMetro Trains CEO Raymond O'Flaherty says the Metro Tunnel is safe and ready to begin operations. (ABC News)\n\nFRV said it had been involved in the project from its early stages to ensure crucial safety features were included in the tunnel's designs.\n\nIt said there was a contingency plan for any radio faults.\n\nThe UFU has been waging a campaign about safety in the underground rail network and the new West Gate Tunnel road project, along with long-running industrial disputes against Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV) and the state government.\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan was joined by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese earlier this month in announcing the early opening date of Sunday, November 30.",

(Getty Images: Mark Sutton)\n\nWearing happens when the bottom of the car drags along the track. The rule exists to stop teams from running their cars too low, which gives the vehicle an aerodynamic advantage.\n\nTwo previous plank disqualifications \u2014 in Shanghai earlier this year and in Austin in 2023 \u2014 came during sprint weekends and had been explained as teams not having enough time to practise and verify calculations around fuel load and suspension configuration.\n\nWet weather in Las Vegas had made it difficult for teams to lock in a configuration that would suit qualification and withstand the race, while the bumpiness of the Vegas circuit also meant a greater risk to the plank wearing down.\n\nHowever, McLaren was the only team to make a mistake.\n\nSensors on the plank can tell the team that it is wearing more than usual during a race, but there is no way to judge exactly how much wear the plank has endured. The team had directed the drivers to drive more conservatively mid-race, suggesting they knew there was an issue.\n\n\"The skid wear of car numbers 81 and 04 was checked,\" the technical delegate's report read.\n\n\"The rearmost skid was measured on both cars according to the team's submission in accordance with TD039 M, item 1.2 b) i).\n\n\"The measured thickness was less than 9mm on both cars, which is the minimum thickness required by TR Article 3.5.9 e).\"\n\nTeam apologises to drivers\n\nMcLaren said the breach was unintentional, and a high level of \"porpoising\" had caused the error. Porpoising is the rhythmic bounce of the bottom car during the race.\n\n\"We apologise to Lando and Oscar for the loss of points today, at a critical time in their championship campaigns after two strong performances from them all weekend,\" team principal Andrea Stella said in a McLaren statement.\n\nThe damaged underfloor plank from a McLaren car during the 2014 season. (Getty Images: Darren Heath)\n\n\"During the race, both cars experienced unexpected, high levels of porpoising not seen in the practice sessions, which led to excessive contact with the ground.\n\n\"We are investigating the reasons for this behaviour of the car, including the effect of accidental damage sustained by both cars, which we found after the race, and that led to an increase of movement of the floor.\n\n\"As the FIA noted, the breach was unintentional.\"\n\nMcLaren had argued that interrupted practice sessions \u2014 including one that was almost completely wiped out due to a loose drainage cover \u2014 qualified as mitigating circumstances.\n\nRace stewards wrote that while they did agree that the breach was unintentional, there was no provision for a lesser punishment than disqualification.\n\n\"The team submitted that the degree of the breach was lower than prior breaches of this regulation in 2025,\" a statement read.\n\n\"The FIA argued that, unfortunately, there was no provision in the regulations or in precedent for any penalty other than the usual penalty [i.e., disqualification].\n\n\"The FIA noted that it strongly held the view that the breach was unintentional and that there was not a deliberate attempt to circumvent the regulations.\"\n\nDrivers react\n\nThe incident has left Norris in particular in a precarious position with two races and a sprint left in the calendar, with Las Vegas winner Max Verstappen now sitting equal with Piastri on points, just behind Norris.\n\n\"Disappointing to come away from this weekend with no points after an unfortunate disqualification due to skid wear,\" Australian star Piastri said.\n\nWhat Piastri needs to do in the final rounds to snatch the F1 championship Here is how the drivers' championship is poised with two rounds remaining.\n\n\"With how close the grid is, we're always looking at where we can gain performance, and we didn't get it right this time.\n\n\"We now need to reset, refocus and push to get the best points possible in the final two rounds, both tracks that we've been strong at previously.\"\n\nNorris said he was frustrated as his title hopes looked more uncertain.\n\n\"A frustrating end to today,\" Norris said.\n\n\"We had to do some managing towards the end of the race, and now we know it was due to some issues with our car, which have unfortunately resulted in us being disqualified.\n\n\"It's frustrating to lose so many points. As a team, we're always pushing to find as much performance as we can, and we clearly didn't get that balance right today.\"",

(Supplied: Rod Evans)\n\nThat is only about $500 more than the quote offered to the Malligans for a property that has not flooded in almost 70 years.\n\n\"Personally, I'd like to see a bit of an overhaul and a lot more transparency from the insurers on how they have arrived at their pricing,\" Ms Brown said.\n\n\"Many will send their renewal schedules out where it'll say, 'If you want information on how we've arrived at your premium, give us a call,' but that really doesn't result in much enlightenment.\"\n\nGeorgina Brown believes premiums have increased in Wagga's CBD since the city's levee bank was upgraded. (ABC News: Melinda Hayter )\n\nA spokesperson from QBE acknowledged concerns around rising insurance costs and the complex factors driving premiums, including increasing severity of weather events, rising global reinsurance costs and higher inflation.\n\nNRMA Insurance said pricing in Wagga had been updated twice, during the Wagga levee's construction and just prior to it being completed, and that on average, local premiums decreased by up to 33 per cent.\n\nAllianz said it reviewed flood premiums based on government maps, external data and flood risk modelling.\n\nThe ABC has sought comment from Coles Insurance, which is underwritten by the Auto and General Insurance Company, regarding the Malligans' renewal notice.\n\nThe couple has reinsured their property with a new provider, but it was still double what they paid last year.\n\nThe situation has David Malligan thinking about the future.\n\n\"It's not going to take too much to tip us over the edge and say, 'Bugger it, we're outta here'.\"",

Tottenham's first away league defeat of the season left them ninth on 18 points.\n\nEze was at the centre of a summer transfer battle between the two north London clubs, with Arsenal scooping the former Crystal Palace forward from under the noses of their rivals.\n\nIf that was not bad enough, the England international rubbed Tottenham's noses in it on Sunday as he lit up his first north London derby in scintillating fashion.\n\nTottenham had been impressive away from home under new manager Thomas Frank with no defeats and only three goals conceded in the Premier League before Sunday.\n\nFrank set his side up conservatively for his first taste of the derby, with containment, not entertainment, on his mind.\n\nThree central defenders, two holding midfielders and deep fullbacks restricted Arsenal to just one real chance in the opening half an hour with Eze's scooped pass met on the volley by Declan Rice and Guglielmo Vicario saving well.\n\nVicario was not called into serious action again until the 33rd minute when he sprang to his right to keep out a Bukayo Saka free kick.\n\nBut the breakthrough came soon after as, for once, Arsenal found space in the Tottenham area with Mikel Merino's chipped pass controlled by Trossard with his back to goal.\n\nThe Belgian took a touch and his shot on the turn nicked off Micky van de Ven to give Vicario no chance.\n\nTottenham's negative game plan was in tatters when Eze turned on the edge of the area and fired a low shot through a crowd and beyond Vicario.\n\nFormer Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze was on target for Arsenal against Spurs in the North London Derby. (Getty Images: Julian Finney)\n\nThe visitors sent on attacking midfielder Xavi Simons at half-time, but within seconds of the restart, it was effectively all over as a contest as once again Eze was allowed too much time and he thrashed a shot past Vicario.\n\nTottenham had not landed a glove on Arsenal for 55 minutes but scored with their first shot on target as Joao Palhinha won the ball just inside Arsenal's half and Richarlison, spotting Raya off his line, floated a 45-metre shot into the net.\n\nIt maintained Tottenham's record of scoring in every away derby at Arsenal since 2017, and for a while, they were re-energised.\n\nBut any hope of a comeback ended when Eze yet again found space, and his finish was sublime.\n\nReuters",

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nEating outJust open Can\u2019t get a 7pm dinner booking? Bentley team drops strict sittings system at new restaurant A proliferation of new Sydney restaurants has led the high-profile hospitality group to do things differently at their just-opened eastern Mediterranean venue Watermans at Barangaroo. Scott Bolles November 24, 2025 Save You have reached your maximum number of saved items. Remove items from your saved list to add more. Save this article for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them anytime. Got it Share\n\nThe long, languid 7pm dinner has proven elusive for many Sydney diners in recent years, with more venues operating on a two sittings system, often strictly timed to a two-hour seating limit. Now one restaurant is moving away from the approach, which keeps tables ticking over and maximises bums on seats, but can push customers to eat earlier or later than they\u2019d like, especially during busy periods. Watermans launches in the One Sydney Harbour development behind Watermans Cove. Ethan Smart \u201cYou can book whenever you like,\u201d says restaurateur Nick Hildebrandt from Bentley Restaurant Group of its new venture, Watermans. The venue opens at Barangaroo on Monday, November 24. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be kicking people out, we want them to stay the whole night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eastern Mediterranean restaurant, which launches in the One Sydney Harbour development behind Watermans Cove, is the latest venue from the Bentley hospitality team. The same group operates CBD fine diner Bentley, Asian-inspired restaurant King Clarence, and the recently crowned New Restaurant of the Year, Eleven Barrack. The menu at Watermans draws on the cooking of Greece, Cyprus, Turkey and Lebanon. Ethan Smart Hildebrandt said the proliferation of new restaurants in Sydney had left venues with fewer customers to go around. \u201cSo you [need to] look after them,\u201d he said. The restaurateur agreed that the number of sittings at Sydney\u2019s hot restaurants had become \u201ca bit ridiculous\u201d. When Hildebrandt and business partner, chef Brent Savage, dreamt up their eastern Med concept, top of their list was \u201cguest experience\u201d as well as recruiting chef Darryl Martin, whose cooking they admired at now-closed Marrickville restaurant Barzaari.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHildebrandt said the combination of Martin\u2019s flavours with Savage\u2019s finesse and plating had created some early kitchen alchemy. Their collaborative effort transformed musakhan \u2013 a chicken dish of Palestinian origins traditionally served with bread \u2013 into a roasted chicken reinterpretation coated with potato flakes instead of bread. The team behind Watermans (above) also operated the award-winning seafood restaurant Cirrus. Ethan Smart The chefs have taken their own approach to taramasalata, a now ubiquitous Sydney menu item. At Watermans, it\u2019s served with Greek Easter bread, reworked into tiny slider buns topped with taramasalata and roe. \u201cWe pulled back on the sweetness of the Easter bread and brush it with pomegranate molasses,\u201d Martin said. Watermans, which seats up to 150 diners, isn\u2019t the first Barangaroo foray for Hildebrandt and Savage. They operated the award-winning seafood restaurant Cirrus, just a few steps away from Watermans, from 2016 until their lease ran out last year. \u201cThe John dory [at Watermans] has Cirrus vibes,\u201d Savage said. \u201cBut we used to serve it with a green chilli salsa, it\u2019s now a full-blown chermoula.

While Savage insists that \u201cWatermans isn\u2019t a seafood restaurant\u201d, the menu does lean in on seafood, with prawns and saffron orzo, pickled octopus and wood-fired scallop with pomegranate and brown butter. Hildebrandt and Savage have lost count of the exact number of restaurants they\u2019ve opened, but they think it\u2019s 10 and remain hands-on with the pre-launch process. \u201cI\u2019ve been at Flower Power getting plants, and Brent has been painting,\u201d Hildebrandt said. It has been a busy year for the two, who have recalibrated their hospitality group. In March, they sold the plant-based Yellow to the restaurant\u2019s long-serving head chef, Sander Nooij, and his business partner. Later in the year, they closed Monopole restaurant and stepped away from Brasserie 1930 at Capella Sydney hotel. Roasted chicken, preserved lemon, parsley and green olive.

This includes the February launch of Eleven Barrack, which proved to be one of the hottest openings of the year. While sympathetic towards smaller venues, Hildebrandt said venues with fewer than 60 seats don\u2019t make sense for the business any more. \u201cYou either need to be an owner-operator [working in the venue] or turn over the tables two or three times to survive.

    "text": "Every November, Black Friday arrives with big claims of massive savings and \"one-day-only\" deals. We are bombarded with offers that seem too good to pass up. But beneath all this lies something far more strategic.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Friday is not simply about a day (now more than a fortnight) of discounts. It\u2019s also a psychological event, carefully designed to take advantage of how our brains make decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding some of the science behind this process can help us recognise when we are being pushed to spend more than we intended.\n\n\n\nQuick, quick, spend up big\n\nWhen we decide between options, such as whether to buy a new TV, our brains weigh up bits of evidence for and against each choice. We compare prices, features, reviews and what we can afford. Once we feel we have enough information, we decide.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally this process takes time. The more important the decision, the more evidence we like to gather.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when we are put under pressure, that changes. The brain lowers the threshold for how much information it needs before deciding. In other words, time pressure makes us decide faster and with less evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be useful when acting quickly matters. If a spider lands on your arm, you do not calmly evaluate the pros and cons before flicking it off.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut during Black Friday sales, that same quick-decision process can lead us to spend impulsively.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The simple shopping swap that could save you $4,000 a year\n\nOMG, they\u2019re almost sold out\n\nAs well as tapping into \"urgency\", Black Friday sales tap into \"scarcity\". We know the sale lasts only a short time, and many people are shopping at once. This creates a strong feeling of competition: if we do not act quickly, we will miss out.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we\u2019re browsing for a TV, the website says there are \"only 8 left in stock\", and \"12 people have this item in their carts\". Suddenly, it feels like a race. Even if you were not planning to buy right away, you might feel more compelled to \"add to cart\" before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sense of scarcity changes how our brain processes information. When we believe something is in limited supply, we assign it more value, telling us the item must be good simply because others have it in their basket too.\n\n\n\nWhat was I thinking?\n\nWhen we make decisions quickly, we rely on less evidence and are more likely to make mistakes, a long-known psychological phenomenon called the speed-accuracy trade-off.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder time pressure, our brain tries to find shortcuts to help evaluate options, such as how many people are viewing an item. But this may be less useful information than details such as warranty, product quality or long-term value.\n\n\n\n\n\nSignalling that something is scarce can also discourage us from looking for more information. If it seems like a product might sell out, taking the time to compare prices or read reviews feels risky. The product could disappear while we\u2019re still thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur brains prefer predictable outcomes and try to avoid unnecessary risk, so instead of getting more information, we act quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFast decisions are not always a bad thing. Acting quickly can save time or prevent harm when we do not have complete information. This could include evacuating when the fire alarm goes off, even if you are not sure if there is an actual fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut during Black Friday, retailers create artificial urgency. Timers, \"limited stock\" alerts and \"today only\" banners are designed to mimic real scarcity, pushing our brains into decision-making overdrive.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce that sense of urgency kicks in, rational thinking can take a back seat. We stop asking \"Do I really need this?\" and start thinking \"What if I miss out?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the type of thinking that sees you buy a new TV that is only slightly better than the one you have.\n\n\n\nBlack Friday feels like a celebration of savings, but it is also a masterclass in behavioural and brain science. Every timer, pop-up and \"only 3 left\" alert is carefully crafted to grab your attention, and shorten your decision time.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowing how these tactics work can help you stay in control.\n\n\n\n4 tips to stay in control:\n\nPlan before the pressure hits \u2014 research what you really need and obtain more information before the sales season. This will help when the brain has to make decisions under time pressure.\n\nSet a budget and keep it visible \u2014 decide how much you are willing to spend and remind yourself while shopping. This helps counteract the \"scarcity effect\", reminding your brain that other limits also exist.\n\nPause before you purchase \u2014 when you feel the pressure, take a minute. A break lets your brain catch up with the excitement.\n\nAsk yourself \"Would I want this at full price?\" This helps your brain focus on the actual value of the item.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong with enjoying a good deal. But when you find yourself in the middle of all the excitement, it is worth remembering what is happening inside your brain, and who truly benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nTijl Grootswagers receives funding from the Australian Research Council.\n\n\n\n",

With her lease expiring in less than three months, the risk of eviction looms large.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said she's stopped going to open houses altogether because the anxiety has become overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the recent openings I went to, there were over 40 people at each,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remembered overhearing one woman having a conversation with the agent, and she said she had $600,000 from selling her home and was willing to pay a year's rent upfront.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's who I'm competing with.\"\n\n\n\nIt hasn't always been like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nClements grew up in a stable, middle-income household, and through much of her twenties, renting was a practical way to save for a deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Perth's rental market \u2014 once the country's most affordable \u2014 has become so distorted that even former homeowners are re-entering the market as renters, displacing those with the fewest options.\n\n\n\nA crisis years in the making\n\nThe 2025 National Shelter\u2013SGS Rental Affordability Index (RAI) confirms what renters already know: affordability has collapsed nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerth has overtaken Sydney as the nation\u2019s least affordable capital for the second year in a row, with median rents now consuming 32 per cent of the average renter household's income \u2014 well above the 30 per cent housing-stress threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, that figure was 21 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the rest of the country, the picture isn't much brighter.\n\n\n\nRental affordability changes in WA between 2016 and 2025. Source: SBS News Sydney and Adelaide follow close behind, with households in both cities spending around 30 per cent of their income on rent.\n\n\n\nRegional WA has slipped sharply too \u2014 moving from 'affordable' in 2020 to moderately unaffordable, with renters now paying 28 per cent of their income.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisbane and Adelaide have hit their lowest affordability levels on record, while the ACT remains the only jurisdiction considered 'acceptable', largely because its residents earn higher-than-average incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in regional Queensland, rents are consuming more than 30 per cent of household income, making it the least affordable regional market in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Northern Territory is not included in the report as adequate rental data has not been sourced to develop indices.\n\n\n\nA generation pushed into permanent renting\n\nOver the past decade, more Australians \u2014 especially women and single parents \u2014 have been locked into lifelong renting.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 1995 and 2020, renter households increased from 26 to 31 per cent, while the share of public housing tenants halved.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the same period, rents grew faster than mortgage repayments.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenters now spend at least 20 per cent of their income on housing, compared with 15.5 per cent for homeowners with a mortgage.\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, more Australians \u2014 especially women and single parents \u2014 have been locked into lifelong renting. Source: SBS News / Christopher Tan But the RAI measures rent alone \u2014 not food, utilities, transport, medical bills, or school costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many single-parent households like Clements', those essentials push budgets far beyond the numbers on a graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer daily choices \u2014 therapy or groceries, petrol or school excursions \u2014 rarely show up in national indexes. But they define her reality.\n\n\n\nA new life in Australia, but always renting\n\nOn the opposite side of the country, in Sydney's south-east, Charlotte Karlsson-Jones has lived with rental insecurity for most of her adult life.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe arrived from Malm\u00f6, Sweden, at 19.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo decades on, the 42-year-old architecture graduate is still renting.\n\n\n\nRent consumes 60 per cent of Charlotte Karlsson-Jones' income.

Every year it is getting worse.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer two children are 12 and seven, and, like Clements, she pays for food, fuel, activities, school costs and therapy on top of rent.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has tried to access government support, including Rent Choice Assist, but her initial applications were rejected.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News She eventually appealed the decision and was approved \u2014 but not without lasting worry.\n\n\n\n\"I feel like a lot of systems we currently have sort of wait for you to be homeless. And then they kick in to support you,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The trauma and the long-term effect of experiencing that ... it takes years to recover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For a long time, older women have been at the highest risk,\" Karlsson-Jones said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we need to address it way earlier in a woman's life. Especially after we've spent so much of our time looking after the people we care about and love.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the crisis has deep roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've met people who've been in social housing for more than 10 years,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And even when they first applied, their waitlist was already over a decade long.\"\n\n\n\nThe wealthiest state, the worst rental affordability\n\nRobert Pradolin, executive director of housing advocacy group Housing All Australians, said rental stress is now threatening the workforce itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From cafes and hotels to hospitals and childcare centres, businesses across WA are struggling to find staff because there's nowhere affordable for them to live nearby,\" Pradolin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even WA's community services sector \u2014 the very people supporting our most vulnerable \u2014 can't recruit or retain staff because workers can't afford to live in the regional communities they serve,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing, he argues, is \"critical economic infrastructure\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPerth cafe owner Ie-Tehn Kwee said the crisis is reshaping how small businesses operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Generally, we can see the rental prices are extremely high now,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It definitely has some impact \u2026 on people that work for me.\"\n\n\n\nCafe owner Ie-Tehn Kwee says rental pressures are reshaping the lives of his workers and patrons.

If you are living an hour away, you are waking up at 4am,\" Kwee said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The issue is that there are less houses available than people need to live in them. And some people own way more houses than they can live in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKath Snell, CEO of Perth-based housing advocacy group Shelter WA, said the latest figures confirm a worsening trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's mind-boggling that Australia's wealthiest state has the worst affordability for renters,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\"This crisis is no longer confined to those on the lowest incomes. It's climbing the ladder and affecting working families.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSnell said WA needs 5,000 additional social and affordable homes per year, alongside rent caps, minimum standards, limits on short-stay rentals and the end of no-grounds evictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The WA government is making progress, but we need ambition that matches the scale of this crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, the WA Housing and Works Minister John Carey pointed to the state government's record investment in public housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Across the nation, there continues to be pressures on housing and rental markets, and WA's nation-leading economy and rapid population growth adds to the pressure,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our government is rolling out an ambitious $5.8 billion housing investment, adding more than 3,800 social homes since 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This record investment in public housing is about ensuring vulnerable West Australians, including victims of domestic violence, single parents and people with disabilities have a place to call home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the WA government adopted some rental reforms, including limiting rent increases to once per year, allowing pets and minor modifications in rentals, as well as a new process to resolve disputes without the need to go to court.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates welcomed the changes but warned they weren't significant enough to make a difference until rent increases were capped, and no-fault evictions were scrapped.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarey said the state's Rental Relief Program has helped more than 3,600 households avoid evictions and that recommendations for a second phase of rental reforms are expected to be finalised for consideration later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our government continues to do everything it can to ensure Western Australians have safe and secure homes and access to essential services to support their needs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Government's Envoy for Social Housing and Homelessness Josh Burns said Australia\u2019s housing crisis \u201chas been decades in the making\u201d and will take time to turn around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As the Rental Affordability Index shows, the work we are doing to boost supply across the housing spectrum is making a difference,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's why we are working with the states and territories and the community housing sector to deliver 55,000 social and affordable homes for people who need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know there is more work to do, but we are getting on with the job of building more rental homes, more support for first home buyers, and unlocking more social and affordable homes for people who need it.\"\n\n\n\n'I just want a future for them'\n\nClements says she isn't asking for a miracle \u2014 just the chance to build a life where she can save, plan, and avoid living one notice away from crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If [my children] came up to me and asked me for something, most of the time it's a no straightaway,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Or it takes me months to save up for.\"\n\n\n\nEmily Clements says she has to say \"no\" most of the times her children ask for something.

And when I arrived I saw a funeral happening - it was a little bit chaotic I will say.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview, SBS News spoke to David Tiago Barbosa, a photojournalist from Portugal.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was there in 2023 to document the harsh realities facing these miners.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Barbosa reflects on his first impression of Jerada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were working in the mines but without safety - very dangerous. They were going inside with not harness, they were using a bag, a corn bag, and they attached the corn bag to the rope.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was about to enter the coal mine to document their work when this happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA big coal bag coming outside and almost falling. So I took the pictures two, three seconds before the bag broke and almost hit two miners there. So they said to me that was very dangerous to go inside.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says depending on the area, it could be as deep as 15-40 metres, and as wide as 100 metres horizontally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe mines are still closed officially, but illegal mining continues, like in secret, mining shafts are dug by hands without safety equipment, without oxygen, without emergency help. And people know they can die at any moment, but they have no other way to feed their families. Some government projects were promised, but the poverty, it's still there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Mr Hamid - Mr Barbosa's local fixer in Jerada.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to local reports, three people died in 2022 from carbon dioxide suffocation inside a well for collecting coal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story of coal miners putting their lives at risk to make ends meet has been under-reported in the media.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, large protests erupted in Jerada following the deaths of two brothers aged 23 and 30 inside a mine.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust last month, the country's Finance Minister Nadia Fettah Alaoui announced Morocco will adjust its upcoming budget to prioritise spending on health and education, as well as allocate some additional funds to reduce regional inequalities.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days after that, the Powering Past Coal Alliance announced Morocco plans to phase out coal entirely by 2040 if it secures international climate finance.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorocco's energy minister was quoted saying the country has stopped planning for new coal power plants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted the relevant organisers and ministries in Morocco for a comment, and is yet to receive a response.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the locals in Jerada remain sceptical this will change the situation for their community.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Tiago Barbosa's project titled 'Jerada: The Valley Of Resilience' - which was awarded an honourable mention by the International Photography Awards (IPA)* - was only recently published.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe recalls being under surveillance during his time there, fearing for the safety of his fixer, Hamid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA police guy went there and started asking for us, asking for what we were doing there. Because I was afraid to them taking my pictures and my SD card.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully he had his images backed up to his hard drive.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his stay, he met Youssef, a 25-year-old who had been working in the mine since he was 14 and who was already suffering from lung disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said to me that he started working when he was 12-years-old and his father was working in the old factory. And then when the factory closed, he started working as illegal as well. And the father was with lungs with 100 per cent with silica. So it was really bad and using a mask for breathing and Youssef also started to be really bad with silica problems on the lungs as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYoussef has since been arrested in Algeria, while trying to cross by boat to Spain, in search of a better life.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is silica dust, and how is it produced?\n\n\n\n\n\nLung Foundation Australia CEO, Mark Brooke discusses the health implications for the community living and working at these mines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSilica dust and other forms of hazardous materials in industries that are, for example, mining industries are produced when we are cut through or shape or somehow grind in the extraction of those minerals and we create dust in the air and that dust may contain or is most likely going to contain particulates that are harmful for your lungs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe talks about the harmful effects of silica dust on one's health, and why are coal miners largely at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we do know in Australia, we had an outbreak of coal miners lung disease or black lung about 15 years ago, which was a resurgence of a disease that we had not seen for some time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says that was caused by a whole range of factors, including poor regulation and surveillance, a lack of issuing proper personal protection equipment, and the response from mining corporations to their workers' safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSince that time, we've put in place really strong and strict measures that do their very best to protect coal miners and miners, lung health and their health more broadly. And that's because of union campaigns. It's because of organisations like the Lung Foundation and the Thoracic Society working together to really highlight how dangerous dust in workplaces can be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says black lung disease as a disease was always thought about as an accumulation. So it essentially can be someone working in these mines for many years but not seeing the immediate effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the things we know about black lung disease is that often the diagnosis takes place in later years. Increasingly now, as we have seen with the rapid uptake, the rapid number of patients showing with silicosis in Australia that subject to the manufacturing process, the type of stone being extracted, the cutting tools used the level of personal protection issued to the employees.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Brooke says we're increasingly seeing - not just here in Australia but around the world - that the length of time being exposed is shrinking dramatically as people who have only been exposed for a year are showing up with significant lung diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe shares his thoughts on what developing nations can do to prevent this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organisation has recently published a global resolution on lung health. And one of the areas that the New World Health Organisation resolution on integrated care and lung health speaks to is occupational exposures. Every country around the world should be looking at its occupational exposures and lung health and putting in place the frameworks, regulations, and policies and procedures.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Smyth is the Mining and Energy Union General's Vice President in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe tells SBS News one of the first requirements in all countries for any mining sector anywhere in the world in relation to health and safety - in particularly developing countries - is the adoption of ILO 176.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what's really alarming is a lot of countries have not adopted the ILO 176.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCertainly alarming what they're using to be able to get themselves to work without having actually seeing or experienced what they're doing. You're really alarmed. The fact that if they're using, in my words, primitive measures - you'd have to say the working conditions in the mine themselves would be atrocious, would be dangerous. And we certainly lack the basic health and safety legislation, but requirements of to do the job.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says despite there being room for improvement in Australia - it has one of the world's leading practices in relation to health and safety - and uses all mechanical machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you compare it to Australia or other countries, we have standards for lifting devices, standards for slinging, harnessing all those mechanisms as well. So certainly alarming and concerning that workers are putting their lives at risk just getting into the mine, let alone working in tough, hazardous, dangerous conditions each and every day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights groups have echoed similar sentiment in the past - defending protesters in the eastern city of Jerada.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hamid shares the realities of the miners on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMany young men have died in this mines from flooding, explosions, collapsing tunnels, lack of oxygen. Families are left without fathers, brothers or sons.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says even young girls work at these mines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough women can't work inside the mines, they can help to select the coal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEven some, girls between 12 to 16 they go to work there and about if there is insurance, no, some help from the government. No, no protection, nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people have left to Oudja in eastern Morocco to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr Hamid says most of them stay because it's their homeland and they have nowhere to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo the community survives by depending on each other. So sharing food, money and support. Some families collect coal and sell it to the middleman. So the one that it suffers, they don't earn much, but the middleman, he's the one that earns much without doing any job. He's just like buy and then he sells again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the locals want real jobs, not empty promises from the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey don't want to die in this holes. They don't want factories, projects, or legal mines with safety and rights. They want to work with dignity, not in fear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding they are left with no choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one is happy doing this. The go underground, because they don't have a choice. Every time they enter a mine, they say goodbye to their families. It could be the last time. So they work with fear, not with hope.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says a miner can earn between 60 Dirham or ten dollars and 120 Dirham or $20 dollars per day - depending on the amount of coal they extract.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Hamid says the money that they earn is enough for basic necessities such as bread, sugar, food and rent to survive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant that was built was a contract between a Chinese company and the Moroccan government worth over $465 million dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant already exists -- as photographed by Mr Barbosa -- with the cemetery in the foreground.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis company created some jobs, but not enough to employ the greater number of people who continue to have no other option and work illegally, risking their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Chinese company is different because it was a huge investment there and the thing was a new factory, but they didn't have a lot of jobs. So for example, 90 per cent of Jerada is illegal miners and maybe with a new factory, just 10 per cent have a job on the Chinese company. And the other percentage, some people said it was European companies that went there and just say, hey, if you want to earn more, I can give you some tools and you can extract and give to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Hamid says the danger never stops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of them, they just use kind of a turban or something. There is no oxygen. The tunnels, they collapse, flooding kills minors. There is no hospitals or emergency teams, no legal protection or insurance. And the police chase them because it's illegal and that it happened to me personally when I was with David.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Barbosa echoes a similar sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey don't have, like for example good medical centre, if they have problems with silica problems, they need to go to Casablanca or another big city to have treatment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Hamid again, quoting a miner in Jerada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy friend who lives in Jerada, he just told me that they have a phrase that they say there. They say we dig our own graves to survive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Mining Congress this year will be held in Morocco from the 24th to 26th November.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pregnancy was a very, it was a very isolating experience. Because I was depressed and low throughout it, I felt a real sense of shame around not experiencing pregnancy like you think you should.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Lisa Fox - a 44-year-old mother based in the Central Coast of New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recalls experiencing poor mental health during the perinatal period when she was pregnant and gave birth to her son 10 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Lisa was already seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist for a pre-existing mental health condition, she says she was never introduced to specific perinatal support.\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa says she felt isolated and disconnected during her pregnancy and in the 12-18 months after she gave birth to her son Luka.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And in fact, you know, at about 4 months I had about 5 weeks in a mental health facility to support me. And just that shame that comes with that, and how shame leads to isolation, which is so detrimental to how you can lift yourself out of these things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research by not-for-profit perinatal mental health organisation, the Gidget Foundation, has found a quarter of Australians experiencing perinatal mental health issues are not seeking help.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis month's survey of over 1,600 Australians found one third of people believed their symptoms were not serious enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nGidget Foundation clinical psychologist and team manager, Katie Peterson says this is due to a lack of awareness around the signs and symptoms of poor perinatal mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's got to do with people maybe not quite understanding what the difference is between maybe a mental health disorder and what are the different challenges around adjusting to becoming a new parent. Because there are a lot of factors in the perinatal period that we would consider risk factors for why people would go on to develop a mental health disorder. I guess what we know though is that early intervention is the best. So instead of waiting for someone to be kind of more at a serious or severe end, we really want people engaging with professional support early on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Peterson explains some of the risk factors for mental health issues associated with the perinatal period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People are having to adjust to, especially mums, they're going through significant changes hormonally, emotionally, physically, as well as in their social roles. So there's a lot of things that new parents are having to navigate. But we also see new parents might experience birth trauma. They may experience perinatal loss, some parents may have health complications for themselves or for their baby. So it's just a time where things can go wrong sometimes, I guess. And it adds to the extra stresses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShame and stigma also play a role in preventing people from seeking appropriate help.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief executive of perinatal mental health organisation PANDA, Julie Borninkhof, explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know still that people in this country, especially our mums fear raising a conversation about vulnerability because they expect then that the system and community will say 'you're not fit to parent'. And we still hear from callers that they are concerned that people are going to want to take their bubs off them and say 'you're not fit to parent'. And that gets in the way of help-seeking behaviour.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa believes access to tailored perinatal mental health tools would have helped her navigate feelings of shame she experienced at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having perinatal specific support I think is crucial for women because even... I was seeking a private psychologist and psychiatrist and didn't receive the sort of fullness of support you can receive when you're going through pregnancy and giving birth. And I think also from that what I really learnt, is that you need to advocate. It's difficult but advocate for your own needs. You can move on, and find other professionals to support you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting with and speaking to other mothers during her son's toddler years became a crucial support in how Lisa navigated her mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And for me, I think this is a key thing around the isolation that exists in this period, is that you really internalise that this is just me. This is just me, it's my fault, I can't cope. But when you do spend time with other women that are going through the same thing, you can say, oh yeah, okay, isn't just me, this is a universal thing that's going on. This is sleep deprivation. This is just really, really hard.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Peterson agrees that reducing isolation and creating shared communities is key to improving individuals' access to mental health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of parents do need to hear the story from someone who kind of have has lived experience of that, of perinatal mental health. And then I guess they may start to relate to that story and see that for themselves. And then by realising that they're not alone, it really does reduce the shame and the stigma around reaching out to mental health services.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial pressures also contribute to people avoiding professional support, with data from The Gidget Foundation noting 47 per cent of those surveyed relied heavily on bulk billing appointments during the perinatal period, and 27 per cent saying they couldn't afford to seek help.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, as well as First Nations people, may also confront added cultural and language barriers - as Ms Peterson explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that there can be delays in accessing culturally appropriate services, accessing interpreters, and sometimes people from a multicultural background or culturally and linguistically diverse families may find navigating services a little bit tricky or not culturally appropriate. As well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, there is an increase in the likelihood of perinatal mental health challenges and again, it's about finding the right supports that are culturally appropriate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFathers also often feel excluded from perinatal mental health services - with only just over 5 per cent of PANDA's helpline callers men, despite men making up 14 per cent of the mental health checklist users.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is something Ms Borninkhof calls the 'Dad gap'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there's still a significant stigma around the fact that men feel that they have to be the rocks in the family, and we often spend time talking about the fact that even rocks crumble. And I think that services are still behind the eight ball in terms of supporting dads in this country. There's a real resurgence and growth in dads support, but they're still being built because the investment from the funders and the government isn't there because we've been so focused on mums.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa says whole communities need to be aware of the support they can provide new parents.\n\n\n\n",

Bentley team drops strict sittings system at new restaurant A proliferation of new Sydney restaurants has led the high-profile hospitality group to do things differently at their just-opened eastern Mediterranean venue Watermans at Barangaroo. Scott Bolles November 24, 2025 Save You have reached your maximum number of saved items. Remove items from your saved list to add more. Save this article for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them anytime. Got it Share\n\nThe long, languid 7pm dinner has proven elusive for many Sydney diners in recent years, with more venues operating on a two sittings system, often strictly timed to a two-hour seating limit. Now one restaurant is moving away from the approach, which keeps tables ticking over and maximises bums on seats, but can push customers to eat earlier or later than they\u2019d like, especially during busy periods. Watermans launches in the One Sydney Harbour development behind Watermans Cove. Ethan Smart \u201cYou can book whenever you like,\u201d says restaurateur Nick Hildebrandt from Bentley Restaurant Group of its new venture, Watermans. The venue opens at Barangaroo on Monday, November 24. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be kicking people out, we want them to stay the whole night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eastern Mediterranean restaurant, which launches in the One Sydney Harbour development behind Watermans Cove, is the latest venue from the Bentley hospitality team. The same group operates CBD fine diner Bentley, Asian-inspired restaurant King Clarence, and the recently crowned New Restaurant of the Year, Eleven Barrack. The menu at Watermans draws on the cooking of Greece, Cyprus, Turkey and Lebanon. Ethan Smart Hildebrandt said the proliferation of new restaurants in Sydney had left venues with fewer customers to go around. \u201cSo you [need to] look after them,\u201d he said. The restaurateur agreed that the number of sittings at Sydney\u2019s hot restaurants had become \u201ca bit ridiculous\u201d. When Hildebrandt and business partner, chef Brent Savage, dreamt up their eastern Med concept, top of their list was \u201cguest experience\u201d as well as recruiting chef Darryl Martin, whose cooking they admired at now-closed Marrickville restaurant Barzaari.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHildebrandt said the combination of Martin\u2019s flavours with Savage\u2019s finesse and plating had created some early kitchen alchemy. Their collaborative effort transformed musakhan \u2013 a chicken dish of Palestinian origins traditionally served with bread \u2013 into a roasted chicken reinterpretation coated with potato flakes instead of bread. The team behind Watermans (above) also operated the award-winning seafood restaurant Cirrus. Ethan Smart The chefs have taken their own approach to taramasalata, a now ubiquitous Sydney menu item. At Watermans, it\u2019s served with Greek Easter bread, reworked into tiny slider buns topped with taramasalata and roe. \u201cWe pulled back on the sweetness of the Easter bread and brush it with pomegranate molasses,\u201d Martin said. Watermans, which seats up to 150 diners, isn\u2019t the first Barangaroo foray for Hildebrandt and Savage. They operated the award-winning seafood restaurant Cirrus, just a few steps away from Watermans, from 2016 until their lease ran out last year. \u201cThe John dory [at Watermans] has Cirrus vibes,\u201d Savage said. \u201cBut we used to serve it with a green chilli salsa, it\u2019s now a full-blown chermoula. They are talking the same language, but this version is a little more spiced up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom left: Nick Hildebrandt, Darryl Martin and Brent Savage. While Savage insists that \u201cWatermans isn\u2019t a seafood restaurant\u201d, the menu does lean in on seafood, with prawns and saffron orzo, pickled octopus and wood-fired scallop with pomegranate and brown butter. Hildebrandt and Savage have lost count of the exact number of restaurants they\u2019ve opened, but they think it\u2019s 10 and remain hands-on with the pre-launch process. \u201cI\u2019ve been at Flower Power getting plants, and Brent has been painting,\u201d Hildebrandt said. It has been a busy year for the two, who have recalibrated their hospitality group. In March, they sold the plant-based Yellow to the restaurant\u2019s long-serving head chef, Sander Nooij, and his business partner. Later in the year, they closed Monopole restaurant and stepped away from Brasserie 1930 at Capella Sydney hotel. Roasted chicken, preserved lemon, parsley and green olive. Ethan Smart\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two describe the new strategy as \u201cpruning and preparing for growth\u201d by focusing on restaurants they have full control over, and venues of a certain scale and size. This includes the February launch of Eleven Barrack, which proved to be one of the hottest openings of the year. While sympathetic towards smaller venues, Hildebrandt said venues with fewer than 60 seats don\u2019t make sense for the business any more. \u201cYou either need to be an owner-operator [working in the venue] or turn over the tables two or three times to survive. It\u2019s part of the reason we let Yellow go.\u201d Open lunch and dinner daily R1/88 Barangaroo Avenue, Barangaroo, bentleyrestaurantgroup.com.au/watermanssydney Related Article New Restaurant of the Year, presented by Aurum Poultry: Eleven Barrack Related Article Exclusive Three-hatted Crown restaurant Oncore by Clare Smyth to close\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.
