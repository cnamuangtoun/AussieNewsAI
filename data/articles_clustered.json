(GoFundMe)\n\n\"I've been here for six years, all my family are here, and I have a house and a dog.\ufeff I have nowhere to go.\"\n\n\ufeffThe 31-year-old moved to Australia in 2019 on a Working Holiday Maker (WHM) visa, then applied for a \ufeff\ufeffTemporary Skills Shortage (TSS) visa in 2023.\n\nIt \ufeffwould allow her to live and work in Australia for up to two years, after which time she'd apply for a Temporary Residence Transition (TRT) Visa to become a permanent resident.\n\nA migration agent told her it was \ufeffa \"clear pathway\" to permanent residency\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nTSS visas are employer sponsored, so Fraser found a small business in Sydney that agreed to sponsor her as a restaurant manager.\n\nAt the time, it was an eligible occupation for that visa.\n\nWant a pay rise? These jobs experienced the fastest salary growth this year View Gallery\n\nWith the business sponsoring her and the help of a professional migration lawyer, Fraser applied for and was granted a TSS visa in September 2023.\n\nShe moved from Ballarat to Sydney and started work two weeks later.\n\n\ufeffTo be eligible for a TRT visa and permanent residency, Fraser would have to work \ufefffor the same employer for two full years.\n\nShe knew her existing TSS visa would expire two weeks shy of that milestone but there was no \ufefflimit on how many times she could apply for a TSS visa while in Australia, so Fraser simply planned to apply for a second TSS visa to cover the extra time.\n\nThat plan went up in flames this year.\n\nCaitlin Fraser will miss out on meeting the full time employment requirements to apply for permanent residency by two weeks. (Supplied)\n\nIn May, Fraser received a devastating call from her migration agent.\ufeff\n\nThey explained that changes to Australia's visas \ufeffmeant Fraser was no longer allowed to renew her visa, nor would she be eligible to apply for a TRT visa by the time it expired.\n\nSuddenly, she was facing the very real possibility of deportation.\ufeff\n\nIn December 2024, the TSS visa was replaced by the Skills in Demand (SID) visa.\n\nPeople who had already been granted TSS visas would be allowed to stay in Australia until the visa's expiry date but they would not be allowed to renew.\n\nSome could apply for SID visas \u2013 but not Fraser, as restaurant manager is not on the list of eligible occupations.\n\n\u201cWhilst the occupation of Caf\u00e9 or Restaurant Manager was previously available for nomination for a Temporary Skills Shortage (TSS) visa, the occupation has not been included on the Core Skills Occupation List (CSOL) and is therefore ineligible for nomination for a SID visa,\u201d a Department of Home Affairs spokesperson told 9news.\n\nIt means she will have to leave the country when her current visa expires, just two weeks shy of completing the two years of fulltime work required to apply for a TRT visa.\n\nOf the employment requirements for a TRT visa, the Department spokesperson said \u201capplicants are required to demonstrate they have worked in eligible sponsored employment for at least two out of the last three years while holding a 457 [Temporary Work (Skilled) visa] or 482 [formerly TSS, now SID] visa\u201d.\n\nFraser is frustrated that changes made to the TSS visa long after she was approved have now made her ineligible for permanent residency.\n\n\"The injustice is insane,\" she said.\n\n\"This should be for new people applying, not for someone who's at the end of the visa. This isn't what I paid for.\"\n\nScottish expat Caitlin Fraser has already spent tens of thousands of dollars on visas to live and work in Australia. (Supplied)\n\nFraser paid $14,000 to secure her existing visa\ufeff with the help of an immigration lawyer.\n\nShe's now working with them in the hopes of finding a solution that will allow her to legally work \ufeffin Australia for the extra two weeks she need to be eligible for a TRT visa.\n\nIf and when she is able to apply for that visa, she will be granted a bridging visa that will cover her \ufeffwhile it is processed.\n\nBut Fraser fears she won't make it that far.\n\n\ufeffEven if she finds a way to legally work the extra two weeks, she may not be able to afford to apply for permanent residency.\n\nApplying for a TRT visa costs upwards of $4900 and Fraser has been quoted $9000 in additional fees from her immigration lawyer.\n\nShe's still paying off the $14,000 from her TSS visa and had hoped that renewing it would give her more time to save money for the TRT application.\ufeff\n\n\"I live week to week, I'm on the minimum that they can give me, and I live in Sydney which is the most expensive city in the world,\" she said.\n\nThe suburbs Australia's richest people call home View Gallery\n\nApplying without the assistance of an immigration lawyer to save money isn't an option either.\n\n\"It's impossible for me alone to do the application in eight weeks. It's a massive process, even the migration officers are going to find it hard to do it in that time,\" Fraser said.\n\nFraser's family have started an online crowdfunding campaign \ufeffto help cover the costs.\n\nIf she's unable to secure or pay for a new visa before her TSS visa expires, she'll be forced to leave Australia on September 14.\n\nWith no savings and no family back in Scotland, Fraser doesn't know where she'll go if that comes to pass.\n\nShe fears she won't be the only one forced out of the country due to changes to the old TSS visa.\ufeff",

(ABC News: Sophie Johnson)\n\nThe once-in-a-century flood left the area completely inundated and cut off from the outside world.\n\nFacing down the flood\n\nCane grower Ian Kemp has lived and worked on his Ingham farm, about halfway between Cairns and Townsville, for more than 60 years.\n\nWhile Ingham is no stranger to floods and residents generally know what to expect, he said this year was anything but ordinary.\n\n\"We've had some bad floods through my lifetime, but this one in my area out here was by far the worst,\" he said.\n\n\"I personally have about, I'd say 2,000 tonne I've lost.\n\n\"It's going to take me about three to four years to recover ... to pick those paddocks up and get them back to full production again.\"\n\nJohn Board says the impact on his farm is \"massive\". (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nAt John Board's cane farm it was a similar story.\n\nLooking down the barrel of an expensive clean-up, his battle with debris, washout and damage to the cane is ongoing.\n\n\"The actual damage to the crop itself, and then infrastructure damage as well, has been massive,\" he said.\n\n\"There's no way I could cut cane on this headland here yet.\"\n\nThere is significant damage at John Board's farm. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nCounting the cost\n\nThe Queensland government is providing disaster recovery assistance to affected primary producers.\n\nWhile grateful for the assistance, Mr Board said the system had some challenges.\n\n\"The way it works is, you've actually got to fork it out up front and then claim it back,\" he said.\n\n\"This one headland alone here is probably $34,000 worth of just material and I don't have $34,000 in my bank account.\n\n\"I've actually got to cut cane on a different part of the property to get some cash coming in to fix this headland.\"\n\nJohn Board inspects the damage to his cane paddocks and headland. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nAcross the district, the crop yield will be down substantially, which means less income for farmers and harvesters like Brian Mombelli.\n\n\"We should be cutting about 120,000 tonnes and this year we might only cut 80,000,\" he said.\n\nFor him, that shortfall is worth $450,000.\n\n\"It's cost us about $350,000 just to put machinery back on the paddock,\" he said.\n\n\"We're already out of pocket and after such big floods, it's just another hit to the small business owners really.\"\n\nBrian Mombelli is a sugarcane harvester based in Ingham. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nWhile the water is gone, he says danger still lurks in the paddocks, and harvesters will need to take extra care this year.\n\n\"We could come across trees, rims, tyres, gas bottles, one tonne pods to pretty much everything, even shipping containers,\" he said.\n\n\"The biggest cost that is going to affect us as business owners is trying to find the money to fix everything up.\"\n\nSugarcane yields in Ingham have dropped as a result of the floods. (ABC Rural: Brooke Tindall)\n\nMr Kemp said farmers were not the only people bearing a mental load.\n\n\"I know of a couple of people that as soon as they hear a heavy shower of rain now, they start to panic,\" he said.\n\n\"People in town are struggling.\"\n\nTully still recovering from last year\n\nAbout 100 kilometres north of Ingham is Tully, Australia's wettest town.\n\nParts of the town also experienced flooding early this year and, while not as severe as in Ingham, successive disasters have taken their toll.\n\nLast year, Tully was smashed with rain from Tropical Cyclone Jasper and the community is feeling the compounding effects of back-to-back extreme wet seasons.\n\nWalls of water wiped out cane crops on the farm Roy Butcher manages. (ABC Rural: Brooke Tindall)\n\nRoy Butcher is manager of a Tully farm that lost about 30 hectares of cane to the flood, after 50 hectares were wiped out the year before.\n\n\"Here, our major contributor factor \u2026 this year was from a levy bank collapsing up the river,\" he said.\n\n\"It brought a wall of water through the farm.\n\nRoy Butcher walks through devastated cane paddock washed away during the floods. (ABC Rural: Brooke Tindall)\n\n\" There's probably two-to-three hectares in our farm and we will never be able to recover and never be able to farm on it again. \"\n\nMr Butcher said he was still finding trash in the cane fields from last season, which had mixed with mud from this year.\n\nCrushing on\n\nAt the sugar mill in town, the crush is underway.\n\nGreg Shannon and Ian Speziali work at the Tully Sugar mill. (ABC Rural: Brooke Tindall)\n\nTully Sugar sane productivity and development manager Greg Shannon said this season was better than the previous, but not by much.\n\nHe expected farmers would produce three-to-four tonnes per hectare more than last year.\n\n\"We got flooded, but not quite as bad and we've had a bit more sunlight, so it's an improvement on last year,\" he said.\n\nThe sugar cane crush is underway across north and Far North Queensland. (ABC Rural: Brooke Tindall)\n\nIan Speziali, the electrical engineering manager at Tully Sugar, said water did come through the mill.\n\n\"Being Tully, flooding isn't unusual but, like any site, we are impacted mainly by water inundation of pumps and motors,\" he said.\n\n\"External to the factory itself, there's been damage to the rail infrastructure and those sorts of things, and obviously the farm properties in the district as well.\"\n\nOverall, he said spirits were high this year in Tully, as the 100th sugar crush for the mill is underway.",

    "text": "On Sunday morning Australian time, Mitchell Starc will become just the second fast bowler to feature in 100 Test matches for Australia.\n\nIt's a remarkable feat, especially considering his suitability to Test cricket was a topic of debate for long swathes of his early career.\n\nAlways a world beater with the white ball, he was often labelled too expensive, too wayward and too soft to be consistently effective with the red.\n\nBut as his career has progressed, those critiques have grown fewer and further between.\n\nAnd on the eve of his milestone match \u2014 fittingly under lights against the West Indies in Jamaica \u2014 he can look back on a career defined by longevity, fight and propelled into greatness by the instalment of day/night Test cricket.\n\nStarc made his Test debut in 2011 against New Zealand. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nStarc has always been an easy scapegoat.\n\nHis brand of adventurous, stump searching strike bowling is high stakes stuff \u2014 exhilarating when it comes off, but ugly and impossible to miss when it doesn't.\n\nOften, when things have gone wrong for Australia, Starc has taken the blame.\n\nIn England, particularly, his exploits have been put under the microscope.\n\nSpells of expensive bowling in Australia's 2013 and 2015 Ashes defeats led to selectors determining him unsuited to English conditions and choosing him for just one game in the 2019 series against the Old Enemy.\n\nBut in 2023, he was the leading wicket-taker and a key figure in Australia's retention of the urn on enemy soil.\n\nIn a series not short on talking points, Starc's English redemption flew under the radar, but it was a key marker in his quiet solidification as a Test match great.\n\nStarc was Australia's leading wicket taker in the 2023 Ashes. (Getty Images: Ryan Pierse)\n\nHis temperament, too, was often called into question during his early years.\n\nA young Starc was shy, understated and certainly not what the Australian public had come to expect of its strike bowlers.\n\nDespite sharing a first name and job description, he was a different person entirely to his notoriously fierce predecessor Mitchell Johnson, who himself didn't always know what to make of his more mild-mannered namesake.\n\n\"I just don't like his body language,\" Johnson said on commentary for the ABC during Australia's 2018 loss to India in Adelaide.\n\n\"He hasn't given a bit of a glare or puffed his chest out with a good follow-through, let the batsman know he's in the contest, that he's going to rip the pegs out.\"\n\nStarc and Johnson played Test cricket together for Australian from 2011-2015. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\nShane Warne, too, was often critical of Starc. He was regularly exasperated by Starc's lack of on field verve and helped to cultivate his reputation as a lower-order destroyer.\n\nThat's a label that has clung tight to Starc, but it is at the top of an innings, rather than at its end, that he has shone particularly bright.\n\nHis series opening dismissal of Rory Burns, bowled after leaving his leg stump inexplicably unguarded, proved to be the enduring image of a 2021/22 Ashes which Australia dominated and is one of three times that Starc has taken a wicket with the opening ball of a Test.\n\nWhile his overall record mightn't be as impressive as the metronomic Josh Hazlewood or the generational Pat Cummins, Starc's ability to conjure those tone-setting moments is unmatched.\n\nOften forgotten is Starc's stellar record in Sri Lanka, a country notoriously difficult for fast bowlers.\n\nOn a spitting Gaulle graveyard that saw Australia succumb to a 229-run loss in 2016, Starc took 11 wickets.\n\nOnly a matter of days later, in Colombo \u2014 also a world away from a floodlit Australian wicket \u2014 Starc would take seven in another losing cause.\n\n35 Sri Lankan wickets at an average of 16 are hardly the numbers of a soft, flat track bully.\n\nHowever, for Starc, nothing has been as career defining as the introduction of day/night Test cricket.\n\nIn the almost 10 years since the very first Test match played under lights, Starc has become the undisputed king of the pink ball, taking 74 wickets at an average of 18. That's compared to his overall Test match record of 395 wickets at 27.39.\n\nNo other bowler has even come close to his level of magenta mastery, with colleagues Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins his nearest rivals, taking 43, 37 and 35 wickets in the format respectively.\n\nAgain and again, Starc has delivered under lights.\n\nHe picked up match figures of 9/97 against New Zealand in 2019 and has taken a remarkable four five wicket hauls with the pink ball, but his best performance \u2014 and best Test match figures overall \u2014 came against India in December last year.\n\nWith his team well beaten in the first Test, Starc began the second after Indian batting prodigy Yashavi Jaiswal had accused him of bowling too slowly.\n\nIt was a brave move by the precociously talented opener, and one that backfired horribly. Starc caught him plumb in front with another game opening delivery on his way to a first innings return of 6/48.\n\nIt's hard to say what makes Starc such a different beast with the pink ball, and he's not quite sure himself.\n\n\"Nothing changes too much,\" Starc said in December 2024.\n\n\"I'm still running in trying to attack the stumps, trying to swing it.\n\n\"Some days it works. Sometimes it doesn't. I don't know (the reason why). I can't tell you.\"\n\nHe's far from a one dimensional, floodlight dependent player, but it's his mastery of the pink ball that has well and truly catapulted Starc into the pantheon of fast bowling greats.\n\nAnd there's something special about the scheduling gods conspiring to put it in his hand for this week's milestone Test.\n\nABC Sport will blog every ball of Australia's third Test against the West Indies in Jamaica, starting at 4:30am AEST on Sunday, July 13.",

(ABC News: Billy Cooper)\n\nJackie Brian, chief executive of peak industry body Australian Organic Limited, said the organisation had been working closely with the government to try to make the transition as seamless as possible.\n\n\"There is no additional charge going to be imposed on operators in order to have those certificates reissued,\" she said.\n\n\"NASAA-certified operators will be able to continue to use their existing packaging for 12 months to allow them to have a transition plan.\"\n\nBusinesses caught off guard\n\nWhile industry leaders work to minimise disruption, individual businesses are grappling with the practical challenges of the sudden collapse.\n\nNCO provided certification services to hundreds of businesses across all Australian states, including meat, seafood, baby food and fruit producers as well as wineries, and major dairy companies.\n\nThat included well-known brands such as Bertocchi Smallgoods, Costa Farms, Fonterra Australia, the Tasmanian Oyster Company, Bellamy's Organic, and SunRice.\n\nSA-based organic compost producer Mulbarton is one of the hundreds of businesses now forced to find a new certifier.\n\nRebecca Weller from Mulbarton said the collapse of the businesses was a complete surprise.\n\n\"It was actually very sudden,\" she said.\n\nWhile payment will not be required to be recertified, Ms Weller said it would still cost the business in time.\n\nRebecca Weller says there is a lot of paperwork to get businesses recertified. (Supplied: Rebecca Weller)\n\n\"We will be going through a range of paperwork and time-consuming reports,\" Ms Weller said.\n\n\"Every business would understand when you get audited it's very costly financially with all the time making sure you make the standards.\"\n\nMs Weller said there would also be other expenses from the changeover.\n\nMulbarton Compost has recently added its organic certification to its transport trucks. (Supplied: Mulbarton Compost)\n\n\"Some [certified businesses] have major packaging for a couple of years ready,\" she said.\n\n\" We have trucks that we've just printed our organic certification on because we're also a transport business, so there's a major implication. \"\n\nThe Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has notified organic operators and exporters that NASSA certifications are \"no longer valid\".\n\nIn advice to operators, the department said it was working with other certifying bodies to support operators and ensure a transition with minimal disruption.\n\nInfant formula is among the many organically certified products caught up by the sudden closure of NASAA. (ABC Rural: Selina Green)\n\nCalls for national regulation\n\nAustralian organic products must have national standard certification before they can be exported.\n\nCalls continue to change organic labelling rules in Australia Photo shows A caucasian man with olive skin and black hair walks through dense greenery with a subtle smile towards the camera Organic certification is not legally required for a product to be described as organic, but a business making organic claims must be able to prove them. Some producers say a national standard would give consumers full transparency.\n\nAccording to the ACCC, organic products intended for the Australian market do not need to meet a particular standard or be certified to be labelled organic.\n\nHowever, it says businesses that make an organic claim must be able to prove it.\n\nJackie Brian said Australia needed an internal national accreditation.\n\n\"We are the only OECD country that doesn't have regulation around the use of the term 'organic' domestically,\" she said.\n\n\"In every other OECD country, you can only claim a product is organic if it's certified organic. We're lobbying to have that be the case in Australia as well.\"",

It's nice to be done before midday,\" Kim said of her morning charge.\n\n\"I just knew how much this course can really sting you, so I just played fairways and greens. Had a few putts more than yesterday but just kept it simple and it kind of worked out today.\"\n\nJust two weeks after snaring a third career major at the Women's PGA Championship in Texas, Perth's Lee had been expecting to kick on after her brilliant opening 66.\n\nBut a woeful start with bogeys at the first three holes and a double bogey at the sixth meant she had to play catch-up.\n\nShe did so pretty spectacularly, recording six birdies over her last dozen holes, but she could still only end with an even-par 71 that dropped her down among the chasing pack.\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport?

    "text": "While Pride month is over for another year, queer music lovers are still talking about two of the community's most divisive stars.\n\nUS singers Cari Fletcher and JoJo Siwa are known for their queer pop anthems and have a passionate lesbian fanbase.\n\nLGBTQIA+ community support services Photo shows Hand with rainbow light reflecting on it for list of queer and LGBTIQ support numbers and websites in Australia We've compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQIA+ people, their families and friends.\n\nBoth singers have identified as lesbian or queer, so their recent announcements that they are dating men have shocked and upset certain fans.\n\nIt has sparked a broader conversation about the erasure of bisexual and pansexual identities and the pressure placed on celebrities to live up to fan expectations.\n\nAnd if you're thinking \"who the heck are Fletcher and Siwa and why do people care?\", let us fill you in.\n\nWho are JoJo Siwa and Cari Fletcher?\n\nJoJo Siwa rose to fame on the hit TV show Dance Moms in 2014 for her extroverted personality.\n\nShe began releasing music in 2016 aimed at children, before branching out to pop music for an older audience.\n\nSiwa came out in 2021 by posting a photo of herself in a T-shirt that said \"Best Gay Cousin Ever.\"\n\nJoJo Siwa once claimed she \"invented gay pop\". (AP: Jordan Strauss)\n\nThe 22-year-old has more than 11 million Instagram followers and more than 500,000 monthly Spotify listeners.\n\nIn 2024, she proudly (and erroneously) declared that she \"invented gay pop\".\n\nShe later conceded that while she didn't invent the genre, she would love to be its \"chief marketing officer.\"\n\nJoJo Siwa admits she didn't invent gay pop Photo shows JoJo Siwa poses wearing a black and silver outfit and with black paint decorating parts of her face. JoJo Siwa's bid to rebrand herself from a child star has seen her compared to Miley Cyrus. This is why.\n\nCari Fletcher, better known by her stage name Fletcher, became a queer icon after the release of her song Becky's So Hot in 2022.\n\nFletcher also came out in 2021, after getting fans to ask her questions on her Instagram story.\n\nOne fan asked if she was lesbian or bisexual.\n\n\"I get this question so much. I just exist. If someone needed to put me in some sort of category, for themselves to better understand, I would say I identify as queer,\" Fletcher posted on her story in response to the question.\n\nThe 31-year-old has more than one million Instagram followers and more than two million monthly Spotify listeners.\n\nWhy are they causing controversy?\n\nThings started to blow up for Siwa earlier this year while she was a contestant on UK Celebrity Big Brother, a television show in which celebrities must live in a house together, completing tasks all while being cut off from the outside world.\n\nPeople started to ask questions as she became very close with her fellow co-star Chris Hughes, despite still being in a relationship with Australian content creator Kath Ebbs.\n\nOn the show she said she didn't feel she identified with being a lesbian anymore.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"I have always been afraid of feeling queer, like I have always said lesbian right, but I feel so queer,\" she said whilst on Celebrity Big Brother UK.\n\n\"I am switching letters: f*** the L, I am going to the Q.\"\n\nQueer is an umbrella term for people who are not heterosexual or cisgender. It encompasses a range of sexualities and gender identities and is often used by people who feel they don't fit neatly into a box.\n\nShortly after the show had ended, Siwa broke up with Ebbs (who very publicly called her out on it) and announced she was dating her male Big Brother co-star.\n\nShe doubled down on her comments inside the house, saying in an interview with YOU magazine that she felt \"pressured\" into labelling herself a lesbian.\n\n\"And I think I did that because of pressure,\" Siwa said, adding that a lot of it came from \"inside the [LGBTQIA+] community at times.\"\n\nDr Damien O'Meara is a lecturer at RMIT University in Melbourne. (Supplied: Dr Damien O'Meara)\n\n\"From people I know, from partners I've had,\" she added.\n\nRMIT University's senior public relations lecturer Dr Damien O'Meara said: \"We have plenty of bi and pan people who don't feel welcome in our community.\"\n\nHe believes Fletcher and Siwa are offering a good opportunity to start a conversation and \"challenge the erasure that's taking place\".\n\nFletcher accused of erasing her queer identity\n\nAround the same time, Fletcher released her single Boy, signalling to fans she was in a relationship with a man.\n\nBut her decision to archive all her previous social media posts about her music on same-sex relationships led to fans accusing her of erasing her queer identity.\n\n\"When you've made your entire brand of wlw (women loving women) music and art, only to turn around and talk about how 'magical and liberating' it is to be with a man, it just feels like it was all a phase for you,\" one social media user said.\n\nDr Natalie Krikowa, a senior lecturer at the School of Communications at the University of Technology in Sydney and a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, said both artists were entitled to talk about their relationships but there should be an additional level of \"care, empathy and respect\" given to fans who have come to expect something different.\n\nNatalie Krikow says it is important for people to be able to have conversations about their relationships without it escalating into biphobia. (Supplied: Dr Natalie Krikowa)\n\n\"I think it is important that these conversations are had without it escalating into biphobia and bi erasure, because there is a fine line that we should not be crossing.\"\n\nFletcher talked about the backlash she received in a TikTok video and has now unarchived all her posts.\n\nLoading TikTok content\n\n\"My queerness is not a phase, I have always identified as a queer woman,\" she said in the video.\n\nDr O'Meara pointed out that the 31-year-old's brand is through her music which is \"very personal\".\n\nCari Fletcher's latest song Boy has caused a commotion within the queer community.\n\n\"It explores her feelings and what she's going through, and a lot of her music has always said, 'well, this is what I'm dealing with right now.' And so, if we think of that as Fletcher's brand, what we have is her using her music to explore this,\" Dr O'Meara said.\n\nBiphobia and bi erasure\n\nBi erasure and biphobia are terms for the questioning or dismissal of bisexuality.\n\nBut Dr O'Meara said Siwa and Fletcher had actually opened up an important conversation about bisexuality.\n\n\" We commonly think of queer identities as this very lit pathway and for many, many people it's not. \"\n\nAuthor and editor of Nonsense Newsletter Patrick Lenton, who is bisexual, agrees.\n\nPatrick Lenton says online there is \"gatekeeping over who is valid in their queerness and who is allowed to be queer.\" (Supplied: Jesse Graham)\n\n\"Invalidating that relationship and being angry about it stems from believing that bisexuality or queerness as a sort of broader thing isn't as valid as something say like lesbianism,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Siwa, as a 22-year-old, is discovering what her sexuality is \"in a very public platform, in real time.\"\n\n\"In that particular case, I would've hated for anyone to be viewing and commenting on my sexuality journey when I was that young, because it was a mess.\"\n\nBisexual representation on screen Photo shows Mike Faist, Zendaya and Josh O'Connor in Challengers We take a look at how the \"disaster bi\" stereotype is still ubiquitous in TV and film. But some projects are working to change that.\n\nMr Lenton said there is a lot of online gatekeeping \" over who is valid in their queerness and who is allowed to be queer,\" pointing to bisexual actor Kit Connor (from Netflix's Heartstopper).\n\n\"He was basically bullied into coming out before he was ready, because people were saying 'oh he's not queer enough to play a queer role' and it's really weird and backwards idea of looking at things.\"\n\nParasocial relationships between celebrities and fans\n\nSarah Scales, a PhD candidate at Swinburne University who is researching parasocial relationships and celebrity scandal, said part of the problem here is the \"parasocial interaction\" many people have with celebrities, which is a one-sided relationship that is usually between a fan and a celebrity that has no mutual development.\n\nSarah Scales is a PhD candidate for Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. (Supplied: Sarah Scales)\n\nShe said people can feel upset, disappointed and betrayed if they feel their trust has been broken with someone they look up to, or someone they see within themselves.\n\n\" Celebrities are unaware of the individual expectations we place on them; therefore, it can be hard for them to know they're breaking trust. \"\n\nShe said JoJo Siwa's fans may have reacted more favourably if she addressed her relationship breakdown with Kath Ebbs earlier and was more open about her attraction to Hughes.\n\n\"If they heard it from her first in a more active way, it might have been different.\"",

(ABC Capricornia: Erin Semmler)\n\n\" But then they see this Mardi Gras or drag blingo with these crazy colours \u2026 something like out of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. \"\n\nWillow moved back to the community a decade ago to care for family, and decided to reveal a new part of himself to his parents and his home town a few years before that.\n\n\"I said, 'Mum, I need to tell you something,' and so I came out to her, and she was great,\" he says.\n\n\"My dad grew to understand and just support and love me for who I was.\"\n\nThe town of Rubyvale, with just a little over 1,000 residents, embraces all.\n\nHeaded by Willow, there is a thriving and supportive queer community, which hosts an annual Mardi Gras in September or October and regular drag blingo nights, where all are welcome.\n\nWillow moved back to the Gemfields just over a decade ago. (ABC Capricornia: Megan Hughes)\n\n\"It started as a party that I held for my 50th birthday. I couldn't go away, so that was the next best option,\" Willow says.\n\nIt's now an annual event that attracts visitors from all over central Queensland.\n\n\"I've been able to help facilitate a space where queer people can come and visit or come and live,\" he says.\n\nThe Mardi Gras parade moves through town.

(ABC Capricornia: Freya Jetson)\n\nGrowing up in a small town in Minnesota, Caleb says he had initially struggled with his sexuality and felt pressured to downplay his queerness.\n\n\"I didn't want to be too flamboyant or this or that. I wanted to be a palatable kind of queer person for them,\" he says.\n\nOver the years, he grew increasingly more comfortable with his identity and, after moving to the Gemfields, he says he can finally be his true self.\n\n\"I would say it was moving to the Gemfields that made me finally accept in my heart who I was,\" Caleb says.\n\nWhat makes this region special?\n\nWhen asked why he's stayed this long, Caleb says it's because of the community.\n\n\"The people \u2014 100 per cent. The people are just warm and eclectic, it's a very niche lifestyle, but you have people from completely different walks of life,\" he says.\n\n\"When I was told they had drag queen blingo at this pub in rural Queensland, I was completely shocked.\"\n\nCaleb runs a drama club, not exclusively for the queer community, but a supportive space for everyone.\n\nThe theatre group is new, but has drawn in a big group of locals. (Supplied: Caleb Christensen)\n\nWillow acknowledges that while homophobia still exists in the region, those who support him and the community outweigh this.\n\n\"There are people who will try to bring us down and create division and fear, but we simply will not go away,\" he says.\n\n\" If we can build the queer community and make it bigger and stronger and bring more allies on board, then little by little we can just make the world a better place for everyone. \"\n\nCasey Morrison is one of those allies and is a manager at one of the local pubs where drag blingo is hosted.\n\nShe wants to replicate the vibrant environment where she had worked previously.\n\n\"Where I lived in New South Wales, they held similar events and everyone who works here are allies,\" Casey says.\n\nManagers say the Rubyvale Pub is a place where everyone is welcome. (ABC Capricornia: Freya Jetson)\n\n\"We just love people, we love individuals \u2026 they can be from anywhere.\n\n\"At the moment, we've got everyone here watching the sport, but it could be that everyone is here for blingo as well.\"",

(ABC Riverina: Andrew Mangelsdorf)\n\nMs Rahimi said the language barrier impacted on the confidence of many Afghan women, while other people with a similar background dismissed their skills as common because sewing was a significant part of their culture.\n\n\"Some people think because in Afghanistan, everybody knows how to do embroidery, it's not that important. So when I ask, 'Can you do embroidery?' They ask, 'Who's going to buy it?'\"\n\nA shared love for stitchery\n\nA new initiative run by the Wagga Wagga City Council hopes to answer that question, while boosting language skills and fostering work opportunities.\n\nThe Mending People project seeks to unite refugees with others in the Wagga community based on a common love for stitchery.\n\nParticipants collaborate to make blanket banners and learn mending and stitching skills from cultures all around the world.\n\nMs Rahimi is hopeful the project will give other refugees the confidence to pursue careers in textiles, because it connects them with the broader community over a shared love.\n\nAfghan refugee Rogayeh Uzbak is teaching others stitchery through the project.\n\nRogayeh Uzbak has a passion for sharing her talents with refugees and members of the community. (ABC Riverina: Andrew Mangelsdorf)\n\nShe also grew up in Iran after her family members fled their homeland.\n\nSpeaking through an interpreter, she said she grew up in a \"misogynistic\" family that would not allow her to pursue her interest in stitching, weaving and knitting.\n\nShe said at the age of 13 she was forcibly married to a 50-year-old man who would not allow her to work, but she was able to hone her skills and sell some of her work.\n\nAfter emigrating to Australia in 2023, Ms Uzbak continued to use her craft and now teaches others through workshops, which makes her \"very excited\".\n\n\"I hope by teaching other members of the group, it makes them excited [too],\" she said.\n\nParticipants at the workshop enjoyed stitching some creative designs.

Everyone is genuinely excited to see him play for England again in Test cricket,\" England batter Joe Root said.\n\nArcher was bowling as fast as 150 kilometres per hour, a reminder of his worth to England after so many years away because of injuries.\n\nHe exploded onto the international scene in 2019, playing a starring role in England's victory over New Zealand in the 50-over Cricket World Cup final.\n\nWeeks later, he had a famous spell on Test debut in the Ashes at Lord's against Steve Smith, who scored 92 on the day but was left with a concussion that forced him out of the next game after a vicious Archer bouncer.\n\nArcher has been blighted by injuries since, chiefly because of nagging issues with his right elbow for which he has undergone two operations.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

    "text": "An expert says urgent action is needed to protect a small West Australian fishing town at risk of inundation from looming king tides.\n\nLancelin, 125 kilometres north of Perth, is home to fewer than 1,000 people, but its picturesque sand dunes and beaches attract thousands of tourists each year.\n\nBut while the town's inland dunes are famous for four-wheel driving and sand boarding, residents say the dunes closer to the coast have been steadily eroded by the ocean.\n\nWith the town itself sitting below sea level, locals are concerned the combination of winter weather and forecast high tide could put their homes and businesses at risk.\n\nGlen Trebilcock purchased the Lancelin Sands Hotel with hopes to be in Lancelin for the rest of his life. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chloe Henville/Piper Duffy)\n\nGlenn Trebilcock moved to Lancelin just over two years ago, hoping to spend the rest of his life running the beachfront Sands Hotel.\n\nMr Trebilcock said he had lost 25 to 30 metres of beachfront to erosion since his arrival.\n\n\"Everyone knows that the ocean's very cyclic, but not at this ferocity and rapid erosion rate,\" Mr Trebilcock said.\n\nCoastal experts have told the Shire of Gingin that buildings like the Lancelin Sands Hotel are at risk of inundation. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nAnxious about his business, Mr Trebilcock started a petition calling on the government for assistance.\n\nWithin 24 hours, more than 200 people had signed in support.\n\n\"It's my livelihood, it's my business, home and community,\" he said.\n\n\" We've got big winter weather on the way \u2026 if [the erosion] continues at this rate, then I'm truly worried for everyone. \"\n\nGary Screaigh says he is happy to watch nature take its course. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nGary Screaigh has owned the Lancelin North End Caravan Park for 42 years and said he noticed the ocean getting more turbulent.\n\n\"You can nearly surf on the beach here at times, whereas before the ocean's always been very placid,\" he said.\n\nGary Screaigh says tides have been more \"vicious\" in recent years. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nBut Mr Screaigh said he was not worried about the impact erosion might have on him.\n\n\"I suppose it would be different if I was just beginning something, but I'm towards the end of my life,\" he said.\n\n\" Whatever Mother Nature does, I'll just go along with it. \"\n\nLinda Balcombe worries about what could happen if mitigation isn't put in place by August. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nTown's future under threat\n\nGingin shire president Linda Balcombe said damage to Lancelin's coastal barrier had become worse.\n\n\"We've lost some shire infrastructure, which is in front of the hotel and it's moved at quite an aggressive rate,\" she said.\n\nThe council has engaged coastal engineers and the Department of Transport for advice.\n\nA cement footpath at the front of the Lancelin Sands Hotel has crumbled into the ocean. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nMs Balcombe said the engineers warned her of a predicted king tide, expected in August, which could pose serious risk to the whole town.\n\nAdvice included the construction of a fresh dune at a 45-degree angle to the hotel and caravan park.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology said while it was not a scientific term, a king tide described a \"remarkably high tide\".\n\nA BOM spokesperson said its tide predictions forecast some larger tides at Lancelin during August, but not the largest of the year.\n\n\"If the king tide comes and we haven't got anything in place, we're not sure what damage could happen,\" Ms Balcombe said.\n\n\"That could create inundation into the town and especially the caravan park.\n\n\"It would also be devastating for the hotel \u2026 I'd hate to think it would be in danger of being closed down.\"\n\nWhat's left of the footpath in front of the Sands Hotel, taken from a drone view showing coastal erosion damage. (Supplied: Kaeto Hoffman/DroneSphereAU)\n\nFunding needed\n\nThe scope of works was expected to cost the shire $150,000, but Ms Balcombe said red tape around government funding had left them in the lurch.\n\n\"We don't have a big pot of money to protect our whole shire,\" Ms Balcombe said.\n\nLinda Balcombe is worried about what will happen to the town without preventative measures. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nMs Balcombe said she had yet to receive a response from WA Treasurer Rita Saffioti.\n\nIn the state parliament last week, Midwest MP Shane Love, who represents Lancelin, asked Ms Saffioti to state her position on redirecting the funding.\n\nMs Saffioti confirmed Ms Balcombe's letter had been received and was \"working to provide an answer\" in relation to the switching of the funds.\n\nAsked if there was any provision for additional funding in cases like Lancelin, Ms Saffioti referenced disaster relief funding where shires could apply after they lost infrastructure to natural disasters.\n\n\"But Lancelin is not yet flooded,\" Mr Love said.\n\n\" If you wanted to prevent it from becoming a disaster, surely it would be wise to be able to respond quickly. \"\n\nCharitha Pattiaratchi says erosion problems are going to get worse in the coming decades. (ABC News: Claire Moodie)\n\n'Band-aid' solution\n\nCoastal oceanography professor Charitha Pattiaratchi said a sand dune would be a temporary fix, because Lancelin was built on an eroding coastline.\n\n\"It's a thorny problem because to save our coast is going to cost a lot of money,\" he said.\n\n\"In some places, we actually have to make the decision that this is not cost-effective to try to save this part of the beach and we have to let the natural process take over.\n\n\"So that's the question, what do we save and what do we let go?\"",

    "text": "The findings could explain why the aircraft\u2019s emergency-power generator, known as a ram air turbine, appeared to have been activated moments before it plummeted to the ground. \u201cAt this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to Boeing 787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers,\u201d India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said. Family members and relatives of Akash Patni, a victim of the Air India plane crash, grieve during his funeral procession in Ahmedabad last month. Credit: AP Air India released a statement on the report, saying on X it was cooperating with Indian authorities as the investigation continues. The airline wrote on X that the airline \u201cstands in solidarity with the families and those affected\u201d. It did not address specific findings in the report.\n\nBoeing and GE Aerospace did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The agency, an office under India\u2019s civil aviation ministry, is leading the probe into the world\u2019s deadliest aviation accident in a decade. Air India flight 171 crashed on take-off from Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 passengers and crew on June 12, along with 19 people on the ground. The cause has remained a mystery. A retired captain with experience flying wide-body aircraft said an accidental shift in the fuel switches would be impossible. \u201cIf you lift the fuel control switches, it\u2019s a double action. So you have to lift them and pull them rearwards \u2013 that will cause the engine to shut down pretty well immediately,\u201d the former captain said.\n\nThe switches have to be lifted up and then pulled over a detent, or a catch in the slot, which locks them into position, said the former captain, who noted that a plane cannot take off with switches in an off position. \u201cThe only time you would use those switches as part of a shutdown on restart checklist, you would attempt to recycle to start switches on the engine to cause the engine to \u2018re-light\u2019 (as we say in the business),\u201d the retired captain said. The tail of the Air India plane became wedged in the dining hall of a medical students\u2019 hostel. Credit: Getty \u201cI can assume, possibly, that one or other pilots turn both fuel control switches off just before the crash in order to minimise the fire risk, but that\u2019s only an assumption, and it\u2019s an extreme assumption.\n\nLoading \u201cIn the absence of a direct suicide attempt by one or the other of the pilots \u2013 and there\u2019s no indication of that \u2013 I can\u2019t see why the switches would\u2019ve been turned off. \u201cThey certainly wouldn\u2019t have been turned off inadvertently. \u201cYou cannot bump those switches and inadvertently drag them aft. Nor can you do that to both. You have to individually grab the switch and rotate it to the after position to stop the engine.\u201d There are only two reasons they would have turned off the engines, the retired captain said, one would be a \u201cfrantic attempt\u201d to get the engines to restart.\n\nLoading \u201cBut the engine would take 30 to 45 seconds to spool back up,\u201d the ex-captain said. The other possibility was \u201cthat they knew they were going to crash, so they just shut the switches to minimise their total fire risk\u201d. \u201cIf they did that, they were very brave and confident men and thinking about what they were doing right to the end.\u201d Catastrophic crash\n\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner, bound for Gatwick in Britain, lost altitude almost immediately after take-off, sinking and hitting buildings on the ground. The apparent dual failure of its engines has raised questions about the cause of the catastrophe. The Boeing Dreamliner has had a strong safety record, and the findings of the investigation are being closely watched for fallout for the Indian airline and the US aircraft manufacturer. Asked for a comment from Boeing, the company said: \u201cConsistent with US law and the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation protocol known as Annex 13, we will refer you to India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau for any information.\u201d India\u2019s aircraft accident bureau recently contradicted reports in Indian media by saying the flight black boxes had survived the crash and were expected to yield \u201cgood data\u201d, Reuters reported.\n\nLoading Black boxes routinely record 300 parameters of information that can be parsed and compared with cockpit conversation and other sounds from the last minutes of the crash to understand what the cause was. Boeing has been beset by a number of troubles linked to previous crashes of its planes, which have raised questions about the future of the aircraft maker behemoth. An issue linked to a flawed flight control system was determined to be the cause of the Indonesian Lion Air Boeing 737 Max crash in 2018 and the Ethiopian Airlines crash of the same model in 2019. The global fleet of 737 Max aircraft was grounded. Regulators in the US have forced Boeing to slow down the production of planes while it examines its work and safety practices. The delays have weakened Boeing\u2019s competitive position against its lone peer plane maker, Airbus. Both manufacturers have had their production levels struggle amid supply chain disruptions driven by the COVID shutdowns.",

    "text": "Federal Energy and Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen says the government sees plenty of potential in EVs and setting up the grid so that vehicles can be used like \u201chousehold batteries on wheels\u201d. \u201cOur government wants to make sure that Australians can take back control of their energy bills,\u201d Bowen says. \u201cWhether that\u2019s through installing a cheaper home battery, or purchasing a V2G EV, Aussie households are increasingly looking to renewable options that work for them to slash their power bills.\u201d The Clarkes use power from their car in their home, and sell excess to the grid. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen A battery for a modern electric vehicle enabled for V2G charging is 50 to 100 kWh, while a plug-in hybrid battery starts from 20 kWh. A typical home battery is six to 10 kWh, meaning the battery in a typical EV is much more powerful than one on the side of a house. Clarke bought his Nissan Leaf in April 2023 after researching home batteries and realising that the cost per kilowatt hour of storage was significantly lower in a car. \u201cI got a 60 kWh battery for $60,000, while a Tesla Powerwall costs $15,000 for 13 kWh,\u201d he says.\n\nThe possibilities are enormous. When EVs become batteries on wheels, a city full of solar on rooftops and EVs in driveways becomes a distributed power plant, making it more possible to switch off the ageing coal-fired power fleet. By the early 2030s, the combined battery capacity of all EVs in Australia is likely to surpass all other forms of storage in the national energy market, including Snowy 2.0, says the Australian Renewable Energy Agency\u2019s national road map for bidirectional EV charging. By 2050, the storage in the national EV fleet is likely to be three times higher than the total storage capacity in the national energy market. Yet, the road map notes, the capital cost of enabling vehicle-to-grid technology is a fraction of the cost to build large-scale storage. Loading Electric Vehicle Council analysis suggests EVs with V2G technology could bring down costs for everyone by reducing the need for the highest-price electricity generation and reducing the need for network augmentation to cope with the handful of days a year when the system operates at maximum capacity. The lobby group wants the government\u2019s Cheaper Home Batteries Program, a subsidy that began on Tuesday, to extend to the V2G charging infrastructure for EVs.\n\nV2G charging requires three things. First, the vehicle needs to be capable and have it enabled. In some models, the capability is switched off or using it would void the warranty. Dr Alina Dini, head of energy and infrastructure at the Electric Vehicle Council, says three V2G-ready cars imported into Australia are the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi Outlander and Cupra, while there is also the Ford F-150 Lightning made compatible with Australian V2G standards by after-market modifications by AUSEV. Second, the charger needs to be approved by the Clean Energy Council. Finally, the network must allow it and the retailer to offer pricing to support it. Things are moving rapidly. Ausgrid, the electricity distributor for much of Sydney, signalled on Tuesday that it had successfully plugged a vehicle-to-grid system into its network, enabling a two-way flow of energy that effectively turns EVs into batteries on wheels. Loading Ausgrid\u2019s head of EVs, Nick Black, says some retailers have been early adopters, involved in testing how it would work, so there are already offers in the market.\n\nBlack says the technology will be a game changer for the grid, eventually. \u201cWe just need that EV adoption in place,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s still a low penetration of EVs, and we see that due to a lack of highly available public charging infrastructure.\u201d The company is lobbying the NSW government to change the rules to allow it to directly own and maintain public EV chargers on its power poles, a proposal fiercely resisted by standalone EV-charging companies. Essential Energy, which covers 95 per cent of NSW, said V2G charging for AUSEV\u2019s Ford F-150 Lightning was market-ready at the Smart Energy Conference in April, after a long period testing the Nissan Leaf. The power distributor and CSIRO are investigating V2G technology with other car manufacturers. Endeavour Energy, the third NSW network, has also been trialling V2G technology and said it would allow any charger approved by the Clean Energy Council.\n\nIn Victoria, the company that covers Melbourne and much of regional Victoria through ownership of Powercor, CitiPower and United Energy has been running a trial of V2G charging and is preparing to roll it out more widely. Daniel Bye, Powercor head of customer connections and requests, says the company would treat vehicle-to-grid chargers the same as any other battery connected to the network, and any charger approved by the Clean Energy Council would automatically be approved. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited by the possibilities V2X technology offers our customers and the community,\u201d Bye says. (The V2X term includes vehicle to grid, vehicle to home, and vehicle to load \u2013 the final one being when you can plug in appliances such as power tools or camping fridges directly into the battery.) Loading\n\nIn financial modelling by the Electric Vehicle Council, a customer in western Sydney who has an electricity plan with exposure to the wholesale price of electricity (such as Amber Electric) could earn $1000 a year by charging an EV when the cost of electricity is low and discharging to the grid between 6pm and 10pm each day. A customer with a power plan with time-of-use tariffs (such as OVO Energy) could save $500 a year by charging the EV battery when the electricity is free during the day and using it to power their appliances when the price goes up in the evening. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for something that sits statically in a driveway or a car park to be a way to help consumers not only save money but potentially even earn from it,\u201d says Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Julie Delvecchio. \u201cIt transfoms what an electric vehicle is, from just a car to a method to support the grid, which I think is really significant.\u201d The Clarkes already had a 10 kWh solar system, but the power bills were still about $3000 a year before they moved to Amber Electric, and the petrol for the car was $3000 a year. A year later, Francis Clarke has a credit of $400 on his electricity bill, after powering both his house and car, despite having driven 26,000 kilometres. As well as the financial rewards, Clarke is interested in the environmental benefits.",

    "text": "The manipulation occurs for planes as flights pass adjacent to areas where militaries disrupt or alter GPS signals to ward off attacks, confuse hostile drones and missiles, or harass pilots. Civilian airlines flying long-haul routes, such as those between Australia and Europe, can be affected. GPS jamming, conducted by military forces, is near constant around Ukraine and parts of Russia. At any given time, the incidence of spoofing that affects commercial airspace shifts. But to give an example, in July to August 2024, the top airspace regions affected by spoofing were Cyprus, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Russia and Pakistan, according to GPS Spoofing Workgroup report. There has been a more than 200 per cent increase in Global Positioning System loss events between 2021 and 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). \u201cWith continued geopolitical tensions, it is difficult to see this trend reversing in the near term,\u201d said Nick Careen, IATA\u2019s senior vice president for operations, safety and security.\n\nSpoofing can create some strange effects in the cockpit, like being at 30,000 feet when an alarm comes on telling the pilot to immediately pull up to avoid the ground, or the clocks used by the captain and first officer no longer read the same time. An instrument can falsely indicate a plane is far from its actual location. Another pilot, who flies through affected regions, said GPS jamming now happens daily. The aircraft loses the connection to the GPS, and it flies a bit further and regains the signal again. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal if it\u2019s for a limited time while en route.\u201d GPS spoofing, while less frequent, poses a bigger problem, the pilot said. \u201cThat is much more serious if it goes haywire.\u201d It can change the timing of clocks in the aircraft and in the worst case, it can mess with the instruments reading the position of the plane, he said.\n\nPlanes with their GPS spoofed can unexpectedly turn without air traffic control clearance, deviating from their cleared route. This can put them at risk of entering dangerous or military areas, as almost occurred in 2023 on a flight from Europe to Dubai, according to OpsGroup, an organisation of international flight operations professionals. There\u2019s some history here. Civilian planes didn\u2019t use GPS until after Korean Air Lines flight 007 was shot down by Soviet aircraft in 1983 after it drifted into Russian airspace. The downing of the Boeing 747-230B, amid Cold War tensions, killed 269 people, and prompted the US government to permit the US-built GPS system to be used for civilian aviation. Experts fear that the abundance of false alarms around GPS can erode a pilot\u2019s awareness, or increase distrust of the data. A recent OpsGroup report identified loss of safe distance between other planes on the air route due to false instruments warnings as one of the safety concern arising from spoofing. Korean Air Lines: the Boeing 747-230B was shot down by a missile in 1983 after drifting into Soviet airspace. GPS became a standard navigation aid afterwards. Credit: Hansueli Krapf\n\nThe GPS Spoofing WorkGroup report also cited instances of surprise altitude climbs by planes initiated by the ground avoidance system in the cockpit. Loading There is also a longer-term effect, too. \u201cDue to now commonplace encounters of GPS spoofing impacts, there is a gradual, insidious acceptance of increasingly higher risk at [an] organisational level,\u201d a 2024 report concluded. \u201cSmall changes and new behaviours that were slight deviations from the normal course of events gradually become the norm, providing a basis for accepting additional deviance and, typically, higher risk.\u201d A phenomenon known as \u201cspoofing fatigue\u201d is also emerging: pilots accustomed to frequent spoofing incidents simply stop reporting them.\n\nThis can lead to a normalising of risk and reduced situational awareness. Different readings on instruments in the cockpit can also cause disagreements between pilots and other crew members regarding the best course of action, clouding the decision-making needed for a safe flight. The pilot interviewed by this masthead said that when they lose GPS en route: \u201cWe basically don\u2019t do anything unless a secondary navigation system warns that the plane\u2019s route is becoming less precise.\u201d Planes can activate a back-up system called Distance Measuring Equipment, which had been the standard before GPS became commonplace. The pilot said he has never been lost because of jamming or spoofing; however he has been \u201cslightly off track\u201d and had to ask air traffic control for help. \u201cThat has been because of prolonged GPS loss.\u201d\n\nIn the pilot\u2019s region and with his company, the GPS interference phenomenon is well understood. \u201cSo we have a spoofing guide/checklist so we can prevent some follow-on effects\u201d There can be complex situations but he said, \u201cWe always have back-up plans.\u201d While pilots adapt, lack of GPS can have serious consequences. On Christmas Day last year, Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243 left Baku for Grozy in the Russian republic of Chechnya when it lost its GPS signal. Russian military forces in Grozny, on guard for Ukrainian drone attacks, had been GPS jamming the area.\n\nFlight 8243 tried to approach Grozny twice, said FrontierSI\u2019s technical lead Eldar Rubinov. The plane lost GPS on approach to Grozny and asked air traffic controllers for guidance to the runway, he said. Loading \u201cThey tried the approach twice, but both times when they reached the decision-making height (or minimum), they were still above the clouds and couldn\u2019t establish a visual contact with the runway.\u201d \u201cAfter the second attempt, they indicated to the air traffic control, that they cannot land and they are returning to Baku, and that\u2019s when they got shot by an anti-aircraft missile.\u201d The pilots mistook the sound of the missile hit for birdstrike. The plane crashed, killing 38 people while 29 survived with injuries.\n\n\u201cIf they had GPS, their minimum would be much lower, so they could\u2019ve descended below the clouds without any issues,\u201d said Rubinov, who audited the plane\u2019s blackbox recording. The lack of GPS was a contributing factor to the crash, Rubinov said. In response to the growing problem of GPS interference, IATA along with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency last month proposed several solutions: standardising radio calls for GPS interference, establishing monitoring and warning practices, and facilitating information sharing. The groups also advocate for restrictions on jamming devices, though the effectiveness of such restrictions is questionable in regions like Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad, a major jamming hotspot, or in Israel. Another potential solution for commercial flights is a controlled reception pattern antenna (CRPA). This technology can detect and completely block interfering signals from a specific direction, making it almost unjammable.",

If you like strong chickeny quail flavours, it's in the texture of butter on bread. It's delicious, it's almost like p\u00e2t\u00e9,\" McEnearney said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what makes it so unique?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the quail meat in the butter did not come from a farm; rather, it was produced in a factory in the inner Sydney suburb of Alexandria, about a 20-minute drive from the restaurant.\n\n\n\nChef Mike McEnearney's popular sourdough bread is now being served with cultured quail compound butter at a restaurant in Sydney. Source: SBS News Cultured meat is the process of taking a small number of cells from an animal, in this case, a quail, and growing them in a controlled environment to eventually produce a type of meat product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It's] my first time in 35 years of cooking that I've seen a new category come to market. It's really exciting. It is brand new food,\" McEnearney said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the verdict from diners?\n\n\n\n\n\nAngelo, a regular customer, described it as \"delicious\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd say it's pretty adventurous. It's quite new in the industry, so I'm glad to have tried it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I really like the innovative nature of it, and I think I'd be really happy to see it more on menus,\" another patron, Benjamin Heenan, told SBS News.\n\n\n\nCultured meat: From cells to steak\n\nFrom hatted restaurants to pubs, around a dozen restaurants across Australia have started serving the cultured quail. About a dozen more will have it on their menu by the end of the month.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product is the brainchild of Australian start-up Vow, which in June became the first company in the country to receive approval to sell cultured meat.\n\n\n\nIt follows a more than two-year approval process by the food safety regulator, Food Standards Australia New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen Dinsmoor, Vow's CEO, insists the company is not trying to replace meat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we make is very unique in that it's not plant-based, we're not trying to recreate beef and other meats we eat today. We're taking different cells from other animals, growing those and then using them to make new food products,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nDinsmoor said the quail cells are grown in a bioreactor, which is essentially a large stainless steel tank, similar to those found in a brewery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We take actual cells from animals and we grow them in what I think of as a nutrient broth. At the end of the day, you can harvest those cells out,\" she explained.\n\n\n\nVow's CEO, Ellen Dinsmoor, said the company is not trying to replace regular meat, but is using unique ways to create new products. Source: SBS News \"Maybe imagine that if you're making cheese and you are taking some of the whey off the top, that's kind of what it looks like,\" Dinsmoor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the product only made its debut in Australia this month, it has been available in Singapore for the past year \u2014 the first country globally to approve the sale of cultured meat.\n\n\n\nWhy grow food in a factory?\n\nPaul Wood, an adjunct professor in biotechnology at Monash University, said: \"Well, for some people, it's because they don't want to see animals harmed. For others, it's an environmental thing. They believe that this is going to be a more sustainable way of producing food.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some just say it's a new food experience. So there's a range of ways that it's being sort of marketed to people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Wood said until the industry scales up significantly, it remains unclear whether it will be more sustainable than farming.\n\n\n\n\"It will use less land. It's a factory. It'll probably use less water. But we already know that on an energy basis, it's unlikely to be more sustainable because it's quite an energy-intensive process,\" Wood said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So you really need to be using totally renewable energy. And even then, if you compare it to growing an animal in a paddock, it's still a hell of a lot more intensive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said cost is another challenge, and when it comes to nutrition: \"It's unlikely, I think, to be better than a piece of meat.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut others believe the industry has a role to play in addressing future food challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural production will need to increase by approximately 60 per cent to meet global food demand by 2050.\n\n\n\nThe animal cells are grown inside a large stainless steel tank in what Vow describes as a \"nutrient-dense broth\". Credit: Supplied / Vow Sam Perkins is the CEO of Cellular Agriculture Australia, a not-for-profit that aims to advance cellular agriculture, a process that utilises cells and innovative biotechnologies to produce new ingredients, food and agricultural products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's widely recognised that we're not going to be able to do that sustainably using existing methods alone,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We see cellular agriculture and the technologies that sit within it as a way of complementing existing food supply chains \u2026 where the technologies offer the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce land use and reduce water use, whilst also building resilience, particularly around things like climate shocks or supply chain disruptions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology is being harnessed to make everything from coffee to palm oil, leather and chocolate.\n\n\n\n'Frankenstein meat'\n\nThere are calls for better investment in the industry as countries take steps to ban the sale and consumption of cultured food, including Italy, France, and some states in the United States. Concerns over quality and the threat to farmers are among the issues driving the pushback.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian farm lobby has previously labelled cultured meat \"Frankenstein meat\".\n\n\n\nPerkins said misconceptions are feeding \"unhelpful narratives\" about the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One thing we hear a lot is references to things like lab-grown meat. Cell ag products aren't produced in labs, even if the original technology was developed by scientists. They're made in food manufacturing facilities that look far more like breweries than they do a science lab,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the industry has a long way to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nVow is one of only three companies globally approved to sell cultured meat. Getting governments, investors, and consumers on board remains a challenge.\n\n\n\n",

He sells these to Australian pet stories, and also exports them internationally to locations including Hong Kong and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut his export permit expired late last year and the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) is now assessing a three-year extension \u2014 a move the Animal Justice Party says would be \"reckless and short-sighted\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News attempted to contact Cooper for comment but he was unavailable.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say it's difficult to know whether harvesting the crustaceans is sustainable, due to regulatory gaps in Australia's hermit crab trade.\n\n\n\nA little-known industry\n\nThe species \u2014 Coenobita variabilis \u2014 is endemic to Australia, found only along the north-western coast of Western Australia and in parts of the Northern Territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its proposal to the DCCEEW, Crazy Crabs said the business collects on average 30,000 crabs each. In summer, he and a small crew head out for four to six days at a time, collecting crabs at night on foot using torches and buckets. \"Really small\" crabs are left on the beach.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says collections happen \"only a couple of times a year\" and these don't \"appear to have any detriment on populations\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut reliable data on hermit crab harvesting is scarce.\n\n\n\nDuring a typical year, Merv Cooper collects 30,000 crabs from Western Australian beaches \u2014 which he sends off to pet shops across Australia. Source: Getty / Jamie La Australian states and territories are responsible for domestic trade, including licensing requirements. This makes it difficult to determine the exact number of active hermit crab export operators in Australia, the quantity of crabs they collect, and the potential impact of this activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an ABC report in 2022, WA Fisheries data indicated around 80,000 land hermit crabs were collected by two active operators that year. At the time, they estimated the commercial value of a hermit crab licence to be between $1 million and $5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nA DCCEEW spokesperson said the federal government \"strictly regulates commercial trade in wildlife and wildlife products from Australian native species, such as hermit crabs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Justice Party MPs say the application highlights a lack of scientific rigour in how such trades are assessed \u2014 and could open the door to further exploitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This proposal is a stark example of the federal government's failure to uphold rigorous scientific and environmental standards,\" said Victorian upper house MP Georgie Purcell,\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Allowing the commercial export of a native species without comprehensive ecological assessments is reckless and short-sighted.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWA upper house MP Amanda Dorn said she is concerned that if the trade is allowed to continue with little regulation, \"fragile ecosystems\" could be \"irreversibly\" damaged.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its proposal, Crazy Crabs said WA's Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development does not consider Coenobita variabilis to be in need of formal management plans for protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said the number of crabs and the locations where they were collected are reported monthly, as required by state licensing laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have been collecting Hermit crabs for over 50 years and have never seen any need for restrictions,\" the proposal reads.\" I don\u2019t go to all places every year, hence there is always plenty of hermit crabs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Nichols, a manager at WA Fisheries, told the ABC in 2022 the species was abundant and their population was unlikely to be affected by the current level of fishing.\n\n\n\n'Relying on self-reporting': Expert raises concerns\n\nKim Feddema, a wildlife trade expert and lecturer at Edith Cowan University, said the trade relies heavily on licence-holders to assess their own environmental impact, with no baseline population data or independent monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to understand how many hermit crabs are actually in those locations and what role they play in the broader ecology,\" she told SBS News. \"Without baseline data, there's no way to judge the sustainability of this kind of trade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the international export of native species is subject to federal regulation, hermit crabs are not formally listed as protected. Invertebrates often fall through regulatory gaps, Feddema said, because they're harder to monitor and traditionally not perceived as sentient.\n\n\n\nKim Feddema, a wildlife trade expert, said more regulation is necessary in the industry to ensure the welfare of hermit crabs and to understand the environmental implications of their removal. Credit: Stephen Heath / Edith Cowan University Globally, land hermit crabs are harvested for both the pet and shell trade. While shells are often sold as decorations, Feddema notes they once housed live animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People often perceive [shells] to be empty, but there is a live animal within them before that stage,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Asia, including Thailand and Japan, this dual trade has already been linked to population declines. While Australia requires permits to collect hermit crabs at a commercial level, enforcement is limited and operators are not independently monitored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're relying on self-reporting here,\" Feddema said. \"There's no verification of what's being collected or the long-term impact on local populations.\"\n\n\n\nAre hermit crabs suitable pets?\n\nHermit crabs play a vital role in their native ecosystems, Feddema said, acting as \"ecosystem engineers\". They recycle shells that would otherwise be buried by sand, creating homes for algae, sponges, and other small organisms. They also help with nutrient recycling by scavenging on waste and decaying animals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut despite this ecological importance, hermit crabs are often marketed as low-maintenance pets \u2014 sold in pet stores and online \u2014 a characterisation Feddema said is misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said in the wild, they can live for over thirty years. In captivity, however, their lifespans are often significantly shortened \u2014 sometimes surviving only a few months or years. She compared the industry to the \"cut flower trade\", where high mortality rates are treated as inevitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People sometimes treat pets the same way they treat cut flowers \u2014 that they'll have them for a short period of time and then accept a certain level of mortality,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its proposal, Crazy Crabs said its experience in taking, holding and transporting hermit crabs \"has reduced the mortality rate during transit to practical zero for the last ten years\".\n\n\n\nDemand for rare and large individuals is also growing, raising concerns about overharvesting ecologically important crabs that produce a high number of offspring.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies have shown hermit crabs exhibit signs of sentience, including problem solving, memory and a response to pain \u2014 which Feddema said challenges assumptions that invertebrates do not require additional welfare standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a question about how appropriate they are to be held in captivity,\" she said. \"If the owner doesn't have the particular needs and they're not able to recognise the complexity of owning a hermit crab.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said reforms are urgently needed to assess population health and establish long-term data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is very possible that this is a trade that is sustainable, but we just can't make that decision without the data behind it.\"\n\n\n\n",

And it definitely fairly immediately actually I noticed that I felt quite numb.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKizzy, who is an Allied Health professional is someone who engages with BEING Mental Health Consumers, an organisation advocating for people with lived experience of mental health issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she never wanted to be reliant on anti-depressant medications, and has come off it twice now in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My hope is that I can one day be not require antidepressants and still maintain this level of functioning and mental health I guess, and continue to improve, especially because there are still, for example, because it potentially affects my liver, like this current medication, I can't consume any alcohol, which is a healthy thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA new review by academics published in JAMA Psychiatry examines antidepressant withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe international team of researchers analysed a large amount of data from over 50 studies involving more than 17,000 patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review found study participants who discontinued antidepressants experienced more symptoms - compared to those discontinuing placebo or continuing an antidepressant.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ramya Raman is the Vice President and Western Australia Chair at the Royal Australian College of GPs.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the decision to start and stop anti-depressants is a shared decision-making between patients and health professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We look at how long a patient has been well and how their mood is actually going, what are some of the other factors that might be contributing to their current circumstances? What are their support systems around? Are they seeing a psychologist? Do they have other therapy in place for example with cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal skills training with their psychologist? And if they're doing really well with all of those and the patient actually says, I've been on these medications, I'm seeing the psychologist, I'm feeling a lot better, there's improvement, my family's telling me that there is improvement, I feel much better. My work has improved, my physical wellbeing has improved.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAntidepressants are some of the most commonly prescribed medications globally and in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term use of the medication - that is longer than 12 months - is rising, and with it the understanding of the greater risk of harm.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew resources have been developed to support safely stopping the use of antidepressants over time usually months, through what's called a tapering plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review published in JAMA Psychiatry included 38 studies which had an observation period longer than two weeks, the critical time frame during which withdrawal symptoms are expected to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review found withdrawal symptoms - such as dizziness, nausea, vertigo - occur in a minority of cases, but they are on average typically not severe and manageable, especially with proper clinical support.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Raman says while there is room for further research on symptoms over a longer time period, the insight is useful for GPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In other words a weaning off of the medication and there is a trusted relationship with the GP in a regular follow up with that doctor, the risk of having the discontinuation symptoms are less the concern though when patients actually abruptly stop it. So the symptoms can include brain fogginess, dizziness, nausea, sometimes headache and sleep disturbances and of course mood changes and irritability can occur.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSonya Morrissey is the National GP Advisor at Headspace, a platform supporting the mental health and wellbeing of younger people.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says there is a growing understanding of how to support patients in their tapering plans - as they withdraw from using antidepressants\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the past, we would've not really talked to young people that we were prescribing antidepressants about the possibility of discontinuation symptoms. But it is something that we are, I think, recognising more and there's lots more research being done now, which is great, although there's not a significant amount of research yet in the cohort that we see, which is the 12 to 25 year olds. So that is a bit of a gap.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says antidepressants are not their first line of treatment at Headspace, but will be used occasionally, if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the cohort that we see at Headspace, which is young people age 12 to 25, antidepressant medication is not considered first-line treatment, for example, for anxiety disorders or for depression because they would be the psychological therapies and other supports. But for some young people who experience symptoms that either don't respond to those therapies or that are severe enough to be really impacting function, we will sometimes use antidepressant medication.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Paul Fitzgerald is the Director of the School of Medicine and Psychology at Australian National University, who is also a part of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was not involved in the review.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it is important to be aware of the more severe cases of side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are some unusual symptoms that patients experience. The most dramatic one the patients find quite disturbing is the phenomena that patients often talk about as Brain Z. They get this very strange sensation of electrical Z in their head or down their spinal cord, and if they haven't been warned about it, it can be quite distressing. It just seems strange.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it's unclear from this latest review whether the symptoms are from their condition - or from discontinuation of antidepressant medication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What happens when somebody's stopping a medication and their underlying symptoms of their condition get worse? In other words, start to experience more depression or more anxiety, and it can be really difficult to know under those circumstances. Are those symptoms that they're experiencing some sort of discontinuation or is it really just the symptoms of the illness coming back because the treatment's been withdrawn?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a young adult in her mid-thirties, Kizzy says it can be challenging navigating the use of antidepressants and the withdrawal process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she's found a way to use her voice and advocate to people who may be in a similar situation as her.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says what can make a big difference is finding a GP with an interest in mental health.\n\n\n\n",

When the bilateral relationship is uncertain, investors will hesitate to invest. With a more stable relationship between Australia and China it certaintly boosts sentiment.

The rider would know that he hit the little girl. He did stop briefly and had a really brief conversation and rode off without helping the young child.

On the contrary, we want to strengthen and build upon them. And there are a bunch of other issues, and certainly trade is part of it. But there are a lot of other issues that we work together on. And we will continue to highly prioritise that. The story of the 21st century will be written in the Indo-Pacific.

In exchange for every return, a different individual will be allowed to come here via a safe route, controlled and legal, subject to strict security checks, and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a one in, one out model.\n\n\n\n\n\nBritain gets to remove undocumented arrivals from its shores.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn return, it accepts vetted asylum seekers with legitimate family ties to the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme is expected to begin in weeks, but the numbers, at least for now, are modest.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources suggest only about 50 returns a week, or 2,600 a year, compared to more than 35,000 arrivals in 2024 and over 21,000 already this year, a record pace.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logic is deterrence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what Mr Macron says - suggesting smugglers are exploiting legal loopholes created by Brexit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Simply put, it is since Brexit that the United Kingdom no longer has a migration agreement with the European Union. And so yes, for those trying to cross, there exist neither an alternative legal path to admission nor a method of readmission after a crossing. And the current situation, in reality, creates an incitement to participate in a crossing. And so it's the exact opposite or what was offered, or rather promised, by Brexit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe went further, saying that Brexit left a legal void.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We especially have to adapt our response to Brexit, and it's that the British people were sold a lie, which is that the problem was Europe. Simply put, by leaving a legal void, Brexit became the problem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn one side, supporters see this meeting as a reset in UK-French cooperation after years of post-Brexit acrimony.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other, critics question whether it\u2019s more show than substance.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, more than 63,000 migrants have died or gone missing while attempting to reach Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis number, recorded by the International Organisation for Migration's Missing Migrants Project, is likely an undercount due to the clandestine nature of many crossings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea route is particularly dangerous, with over 28,000 deaths or disappearances recorded since 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 was the deadliest year on record, with more than 8,500 fatalities.\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration analyst Mihnea Cuibus is from Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe points to the critical issue of scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The real question here is how many people can be sent back. It's a question of scale. If a large proportion of the people who arrived by small boats are sent back to France rather quickly under such a scheme, then it's very possible that there will be a deterrent effect. Again, it's about pure incentives. You're not going to get on a boat and pay thousands to a smuggler if you know there's a very high chance you'll end up on the same beach within days. But if the scheme only covers a small number of people, then it seems very difficult that will it will actually affect anyone's decision. So it it does boil down to numbers at the end of the day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also notes that the small boat crossings, now frequent, are themselves a product of earlier enforcement at ports and lorry terminals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people are actually arguing that the emergence of the small boats routes starting in 2017, 2018 and then ramping up was in itself a response to increased enforcement around the border to prevent lorry crossings. Essentially, it became so hard for people to cross using other means that that pressure, that demand for crossing ended up pushing the development of a new rule.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd those migrants keep coming.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany are Syrian, Afghan, Sudanese, and increasingly from West and North Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost have travelled thousands of kilometres, often after unsuccessful attempts to settle elsewhere in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor them, Britain is not the first option, it\u2019s the last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have had quite negative experiences on the continent. They've tried to apply for asylum in other places, to settle in other places, and they found that that they either didn't get status or weren't getting the life they expected there. And in that situation, your only option is to keep going. And if you keep going through Europe, you'll eventually end up on the north coast of France, and the UK is essentially a sort of last chance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand how we got here, we have to look back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Syrian war in 2011 sparked Europe\u2019s worst refugee crisis since World War Two in terms of the number of people displaced, around 14 million people.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNHCR says over a million Syrians reached the EU after the start of that war.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine also triggered another wave.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the UN more than six million Ukrainian refugees are registered in Europe - unlike many from the Middle East and Africa, a disparity criticised by rights groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Europe\u2019s stance is hardening again.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreece is set to suspend asylum claims from arrivals via Libya and North Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration Minister Thanos Plevris had this to say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, from now on, the road for illegal migrants is go to jail or go back to their country.... The message is clear: stay where you are, you are not welcome here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Plevris argues the move is necessary to deter what he calls an invasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut human rights groups warn the bill violates both EU and international law, stripping people of the right to seek protection.\n\n\n\n",

So, the government needs to invest not just in services, but the things like lower fairs, paid passes and safe bike lanes. And more accessible stops and stations. \"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nU-S President Donald Trump says he'll impose a 35 per cent tariff on goods from neighbouring Canada- and is threatening to make the rate even higher if Canada retaliates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tariff will go into place on the 1st of August, much like Mr Trump's proposed tariffs against Brazil, and other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Brazilian President Lula da Silva has not been cowed by Mr Trump's threats against retaliation, saying he will impose reciprocal tariffs on U-S goods if a diplomatic solution cannot be found.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump has threatened 50 per cent tariffs on Brazilian goods, and has linked his decision on tariffs against the country to the treatment of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial on charges of plotting a coup against Mr da Silva in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIrishman Ben Healy has won the sixth stage of the Tour de France, becoming the first Irishman in five years to win a stage at the world's most-famous cycling event.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealy says winning the 201.5 kilometre stage from Bayeux to Virie Mormandie is a dream come true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To grow up watching the Tour and one day wishing that I could maybe even be there so to even be here is an achievement, and now to win a stage, is just yeah, so, so, so amazing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Storer finished third- the best finish by an Aussie in the race so far this year.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The findings could explain why the aircraft\u2019s emergency-power generator, known as a ram air turbine, appeared to have been activated moments before it plummeted to the ground. \u201cAt this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to Boeing 787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers,\u201d India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said. Family members and relatives of Akash Patni, a victim of the Air India plane crash, grieve during his funeral procession in Ahmedabad last month. Credit: AP Air India released a statement on the report, saying on X it was cooperating with Indian authorities as the investigation continues. The airline wrote on X that the airline \u201cstands in solidarity with the families and those affected\u201d. It did not address specific findings in the report.\n\nBoeing and GE Aerospace did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The agency, an office under India\u2019s civil aviation ministry, is leading the probe into the world\u2019s deadliest aviation accident in a decade. Air India flight 171 crashed on take-off from Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 passengers and crew on June 12, along with 19 people on the ground. The cause has remained a mystery. A retired captain with experience flying wide-body aircraft said an accidental shift in the fuel switches would be impossible. \u201cIf you lift the fuel control switches, it\u2019s a double action. So you have to lift them and pull them rearwards \u2013 that will cause the engine to shut down pretty well immediately,\u201d the former captain said.\n\nThe switches have to be lifted up and then pulled over a detent, or a catch in the slot, which locks them into position, said the former captain, who noted that a plane cannot take off with switches in an off position. \u201cThe only time you would use those switches as part of a shutdown on restart checklist, you would attempt to recycle to start switches on the engine to cause the engine to \u2018re-light\u2019 (as we say in the business),\u201d the retired captain said. The tail of the Air India plane became wedged in the dining hall of a medical students\u2019 hostel. Credit: Getty \u201cI can assume, possibly, that one or other pilots turn both fuel control switches off just before the crash in order to minimise the fire risk, but that\u2019s only an assumption, and it\u2019s an extreme assumption.\n\nLoading \u201cIn the absence of a direct suicide attempt by one or the other of the pilots \u2013 and there\u2019s no indication of that \u2013 I can\u2019t see why the switches would\u2019ve been turned off. \u201cThey certainly wouldn\u2019t have been turned off inadvertently. \u201cYou cannot bump those switches and inadvertently drag them aft. Nor can you do that to both. You have to individually grab the switch and rotate it to the after position to stop the engine.\u201d There are only two reasons they would have turned off the engines, the retired captain said, one would be a \u201cfrantic attempt\u201d to get the engines to restart.\n\nLoading \u201cBut the engine would take 30 to 45 seconds to spool back up,\u201d the ex-captain said. The other possibility was \u201cthat they knew they were going to crash, so they just shut the switches to minimise their total fire risk\u201d. \u201cIf they did that, they were very brave and confident men and thinking about what they were doing right to the end.\u201d Catastrophic crash\n\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner, bound for Gatwick in Britain, lost altitude almost immediately after take-off, sinking and hitting buildings on the ground. The apparent dual failure of its engines has raised questions about the cause of the catastrophe. The Boeing Dreamliner has had a strong safety record, and the findings of the investigation are being closely watched for fallout for the Indian airline and the US aircraft manufacturer. Asked for a comment from Boeing, the company said: \u201cConsistent with US law and the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation protocol known as Annex 13, we will refer you to India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau for any information.\u201d India\u2019s aircraft accident bureau recently contradicted reports in Indian media by saying the flight black boxes had survived the crash and were expected to yield \u201cgood data\u201d, Reuters reported.\n\nLoading Black boxes routinely record 300 parameters of information that can be parsed and compared with cockpit conversation and other sounds from the last minutes of the crash to understand what the cause was. Boeing has been beset by a number of troubles linked to previous crashes of its planes, which have raised questions about the future of the aircraft maker behemoth. An issue linked to a flawed flight control system was determined to be the cause of the Indonesian Lion Air Boeing 737 Max crash in 2018 and the Ethiopian Airlines crash of the same model in 2019. The global fleet of 737 Max aircraft was grounded. Regulators in the US have forced Boeing to slow down the production of planes while it examines its work and safety practices. The delays have weakened Boeing\u2019s competitive position against its lone peer plane maker, Airbus. Both manufacturers have had their production levels struggle amid supply chain disruptions driven by the COVID shutdowns.",

    "text": "Federal Energy and Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen says the government sees plenty of potential in EVs and setting up the grid so that vehicles can be used like \u201chousehold batteries on wheels\u201d. \u201cOur government wants to make sure that Australians can take back control of their energy bills,\u201d Bowen says. \u201cWhether that\u2019s through installing a cheaper home battery, or purchasing a V2G EV, Aussie households are increasingly looking to renewable options that work for them to slash their power bills.\u201d The Clarkes use power from their car in their home, and sell excess to the grid. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen A battery for a modern electric vehicle enabled for V2G charging is 50 to 100 kWh, while a plug-in hybrid battery starts from 20 kWh. A typical home battery is six to 10 kWh, meaning the battery in a typical EV is much more powerful than one on the side of a house. Clarke bought his Nissan Leaf in April 2023 after researching home batteries and realising that the cost per kilowatt hour of storage was significantly lower in a car. \u201cI got a 60 kWh battery for $60,000, while a Tesla Powerwall costs $15,000 for 13 kWh,\u201d he says.\n\nThe possibilities are enormous. When EVs become batteries on wheels, a city full of solar on rooftops and EVs in driveways becomes a distributed power plant, making it more possible to switch off the ageing coal-fired power fleet. By the early 2030s, the combined battery capacity of all EVs in Australia is likely to surpass all other forms of storage in the national energy market, including Snowy 2.0, says the Australian Renewable Energy Agency\u2019s national road map for bidirectional EV charging. By 2050, the storage in the national EV fleet is likely to be three times higher than the total storage capacity in the national energy market. Yet, the road map notes, the capital cost of enabling vehicle-to-grid technology is a fraction of the cost to build large-scale storage. Loading Electric Vehicle Council analysis suggests EVs with V2G technology could bring down costs for everyone by reducing the need for the highest-price electricity generation and reducing the need for network augmentation to cope with the handful of days a year when the system operates at maximum capacity. The lobby group wants the government\u2019s Cheaper Home Batteries Program, a subsidy that began on Tuesday, to extend to the V2G charging infrastructure for EVs.\n\nV2G charging requires three things. First, the vehicle needs to be capable and have it enabled. In some models, the capability is switched off or using it would void the warranty. Dr Alina Dini, head of energy and infrastructure at the Electric Vehicle Council, says three V2G-ready cars imported into Australia are the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi Outlander and Cupra, while there is also the Ford F-150 Lightning made compatible with Australian V2G standards by after-market modifications by AUSEV. Second, the charger needs to be approved by the Clean Energy Council. Finally, the network must allow it and the retailer to offer pricing to support it. Things are moving rapidly. Ausgrid, the electricity distributor for much of Sydney, signalled on Tuesday that it had successfully plugged a vehicle-to-grid system into its network, enabling a two-way flow of energy that effectively turns EVs into batteries on wheels. Loading Ausgrid\u2019s head of EVs, Nick Black, says some retailers have been early adopters, involved in testing how it would work, so there are already offers in the market.\n\nBlack says the technology will be a game changer for the grid, eventually. \u201cWe just need that EV adoption in place,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s still a low penetration of EVs, and we see that due to a lack of highly available public charging infrastructure.\u201d The company is lobbying the NSW government to change the rules to allow it to directly own and maintain public EV chargers on its power poles, a proposal fiercely resisted by standalone EV-charging companies. Essential Energy, which covers 95 per cent of NSW, said V2G charging for AUSEV\u2019s Ford F-150 Lightning was market-ready at the Smart Energy Conference in April, after a long period testing the Nissan Leaf. The power distributor and CSIRO are investigating V2G technology with other car manufacturers. Endeavour Energy, the third NSW network, has also been trialling V2G technology and said it would allow any charger approved by the Clean Energy Council.\n\nIn Victoria, the company that covers Melbourne and much of regional Victoria through ownership of Powercor, CitiPower and United Energy has been running a trial of V2G charging and is preparing to roll it out more widely. Daniel Bye, Powercor head of customer connections and requests, says the company would treat vehicle-to-grid chargers the same as any other battery connected to the network, and any charger approved by the Clean Energy Council would automatically be approved. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited by the possibilities V2X technology offers our customers and the community,\u201d Bye says. (The V2X term includes vehicle to grid, vehicle to home, and vehicle to load \u2013 the final one being when you can plug in appliances such as power tools or camping fridges directly into the battery.) Loading\n\nIn financial modelling by the Electric Vehicle Council, a customer in western Sydney who has an electricity plan with exposure to the wholesale price of electricity (such as Amber Electric) could earn $1000 a year by charging an EV when the cost of electricity is low and discharging to the grid between 6pm and 10pm each day. A customer with a power plan with time-of-use tariffs (such as OVO Energy) could save $500 a year by charging the EV battery when the electricity is free during the day and using it to power their appliances when the price goes up in the evening. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for something that sits statically in a driveway or a car park to be a way to help consumers not only save money but potentially even earn from it,\u201d says Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Julie Delvecchio. \u201cIt transfoms what an electric vehicle is, from just a car to a method to support the grid, which I think is really significant.\u201d The Clarkes already had a 10 kWh solar system, but the power bills were still about $3000 a year before they moved to Amber Electric, and the petrol for the car was $3000 a year. A year later, Francis Clarke has a credit of $400 on his electricity bill, after powering both his house and car, despite having driven 26,000 kilometres. As well as the financial rewards, Clarke is interested in the environmental benefits.",

    "text": "The manipulation occurs for planes as flights pass adjacent to areas where militaries disrupt or alter GPS signals to ward off attacks, confuse hostile drones and missiles, or harass pilots. Civilian airlines flying long-haul routes, such as those between Australia and Europe, can be affected. GPS jamming, conducted by military forces, is near constant around Ukraine and parts of Russia. At any given time, the incidence of spoofing that affects commercial airspace shifts. But to give an example, in July to August 2024, the top airspace regions affected by spoofing were Cyprus, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Russia and Pakistan, according to GPS Spoofing Workgroup report. There has been a more than 200 per cent increase in Global Positioning System loss events between 2021 and 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). \u201cWith continued geopolitical tensions, it is difficult to see this trend reversing in the near term,\u201d said Nick Careen, IATA\u2019s senior vice president for operations, safety and security.\n\nSpoofing can create some strange effects in the cockpit, like being at 30,000 feet when an alarm comes on telling the pilot to immediately pull up to avoid the ground, or the clocks used by the captain and first officer no longer read the same time. An instrument can falsely indicate a plane is far from its actual location. Another pilot, who flies through affected regions, said GPS jamming now happens daily. The aircraft loses the connection to the GPS, and it flies a bit further and regains the signal again. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal if it\u2019s for a limited time while en route.\u201d GPS spoofing, while less frequent, poses a bigger problem, the pilot said. \u201cThat is much more serious if it goes haywire.\u201d It can change the timing of clocks in the aircraft and in the worst case, it can mess with the instruments reading the position of the plane, he said.\n\nPlanes with their GPS spoofed can unexpectedly turn without air traffic control clearance, deviating from their cleared route. This can put them at risk of entering dangerous or military areas, as almost occurred in 2023 on a flight from Europe to Dubai, according to OpsGroup, an organisation of international flight operations professionals. There\u2019s some history here. Civilian planes didn\u2019t use GPS until after Korean Air Lines flight 007 was shot down by Soviet aircraft in 1983 after it drifted into Russian airspace. The downing of the Boeing 747-230B, amid Cold War tensions, killed 269 people, and prompted the US government to permit the US-built GPS system to be used for civilian aviation. Experts fear that the abundance of false alarms around GPS can erode a pilot\u2019s awareness, or increase distrust of the data. A recent OpsGroup report identified loss of safe distance between other planes on the air route due to false instruments warnings as one of the safety concern arising from spoofing. Korean Air Lines: the Boeing 747-230B was shot down by a missile in 1983 after drifting into Soviet airspace. GPS became a standard navigation aid afterwards.

Loading There is also a longer-term effect, too. \u201cDue to now commonplace encounters of GPS spoofing impacts, there is a gradual, insidious acceptance of increasingly higher risk at [an] organisational level,\u201d a 2024 report concluded. \u201cSmall changes and new behaviours that were slight deviations from the normal course of events gradually become the norm, providing a basis for accepting additional deviance and, typically, higher risk.\u201d A phenomenon known as \u201cspoofing fatigue\u201d is also emerging: pilots accustomed to frequent spoofing incidents simply stop reporting them.\n\nThis can lead to a normalising of risk and reduced situational awareness. Different readings on instruments in the cockpit can also cause disagreements between pilots and other crew members regarding the best course of action, clouding the decision-making needed for a safe flight. The pilot interviewed by this masthead said that when they lose GPS en route: \u201cWe basically don\u2019t do anything unless a secondary navigation system warns that the plane\u2019s route is becoming less precise.\u201d Planes can activate a back-up system called Distance Measuring Equipment, which had been the standard before GPS became commonplace. The pilot said he has never been lost because of jamming or spoofing; however he has been \u201cslightly off track\u201d and had to ask air traffic control for help. \u201cThat has been because of prolonged GPS loss.\u201d\n\nIn the pilot\u2019s region and with his company, the GPS interference phenomenon is well understood. \u201cSo we have a spoofing guide/checklist so we can prevent some follow-on effects\u201d There can be complex situations but he said, \u201cWe always have back-up plans.\u201d While pilots adapt, lack of GPS can have serious consequences. On Christmas Day last year, Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243 left Baku for Grozy in the Russian republic of Chechnya when it lost its GPS signal. Russian military forces in Grozny, on guard for Ukrainian drone attacks, had been GPS jamming the area.\n\nFlight 8243 tried to approach Grozny twice, said FrontierSI\u2019s technical lead Eldar Rubinov. The plane lost GPS on approach to Grozny and asked air traffic controllers for guidance to the runway, he said. Loading \u201cThey tried the approach twice, but both times when they reached the decision-making height (or minimum), they were still above the clouds and couldn\u2019t establish a visual contact with the runway.\u201d \u201cAfter the second attempt, they indicated to the air traffic control, that they cannot land and they are returning to Baku, and that\u2019s when they got shot by an anti-aircraft missile.\u201d The pilots mistook the sound of the missile hit for birdstrike. The plane crashed, killing 38 people while 29 survived with injuries.\n\n\u201cIf they had GPS, their minimum would be much lower, so they could\u2019ve descended below the clouds without any issues,\u201d said Rubinov, who audited the plane\u2019s blackbox recording. The lack of GPS was a contributing factor to the crash, Rubinov said. In response to the growing problem of GPS interference, IATA along with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency last month proposed several solutions: standardising radio calls for GPS interference, establishing monitoring and warning practices, and facilitating information sharing. The groups also advocate for restrictions on jamming devices, though the effectiveness of such restrictions is questionable in regions like Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad, a major jamming hotspot, or in Israel. Another potential solution for commercial flights is a controlled reception pattern antenna (CRPA). This technology can detect and completely block interfering signals from a specific direction, making it almost unjammable.",
