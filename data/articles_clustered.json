    "text": "British writer Sophie Kinsella, whose effervescent rom-com Confessions of a Shopaholic sparked a million-selling series, has died, her family said. She was 55 and had been diagnosed with brain cancer.\n\nThe family on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT) said in a statement on Kinsella's Instagram account that \"she died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy.\n\n\"We can't imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life,\" the family said.\n\nAuthor Sophie Kinsella has died from brain cancer aged 55. (AP Photo/Adam Butle, File) (AP)\n\nKinsella, who also published under her real name, Madeleine Wickham, announced in April 2024 that she had been diagnosed more than a year earlier with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.\n\n\"I did not share this before because I wanted to make sure that my children were able to hear and process the news in privacy and adapt to our 'new normal,'\" she said at the time.\n\nKinsella published 10 Shopaholic novels starting in 2000 with The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic , titled Confessions of a Shopaholic in the US, as well as other fiction. Her books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide and have been translated into dozens of languages.\n\nFrom journalism to fiction\n\nKinsella did not grow up intending to be a writer. One of three girls born to teachers in London, she played piano and violin as a child and also composed music.\n\nShe told author-publisher Zibby Owens on her podcast, Moms Don't Have Time to Read Books , that the idea of writing never crossed her mind.\n\n\"It wasn't my childhood ambition. I wasn't the child walking around saying, 'I'm going to write a novel one day.'\"\n\nSophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series of books sold more than 45 million copies. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) (AP)\n\nKinsella enrolled at Oxford University to study music but switched to the politics, philosophy and economics course after one year.\n\nWhile at college, she met musician Henry Wickham and fell in love. The couple had four sons and a daughter.\n\nAfter graduating, Kinsella began working as a financial journalist and spent her commute reading. The idea to write fiction herself began to take shape on the train, and she worked on her first novel during her lunch hours.\n\nShe published her first novel, The Tennis Party , in 1995, as Madeleine Wickham. Soon after, she left her journalism job to focus on writing. Six other books, including The Gatecrasher and Sleeping Arrangements , followed.\n\n'Shopaholic' success\n\nAn otherwise normal shopping excursion sparked the idea for writing her first Shopaholic novel\n\n\"I remember looking around me and thinking... \"We all shop... We talk about it. We do it. We rejoice in it. We make bad decisions. Why hasn't anybody written about this?\" Kinsella said in 2019 on The Sunday Salon with Alice-Azania Jarvis podcast.\n\nIsla Fisher and Hugh Dancy in the film Confessions of a Shopaholic. (Touchstone Pictures/ YouTube)\n\nKinsella created a story about Becky Bloomwood, a 20-something financial journalist in debt from a shopping habit she can't (or won't) kick. The novel contained hilarious back-and-forth correspondence with bill collectors and banks, where she would make excuses for late payments. Kinsella said those letters were one of the most fun bits to write.\n\nThere was also a love story with a handsome businessman whom Becky met while on assignment. She went on to marry and have a mini-shopaholic daughter in future books.\n\nThe humorous tone of Confessions of a Shopaholic was a change from her earlier books, so she decided to submit it to her publishers under a pen name. Her middle name was Sophie and Kinsella was her mother's maiden name.\n\nThe publishers said yes, and Shopaholic was published in 2000 under her pseudonym. The novel, blending humour with a cautionary tale about getting in over your head with debt, was an immediate success.\n\nKinsella said Becky was a modern everywoman whose behaviour was \"what you wouldn't do yourself, but maybe you would if you were in absolute extreme circumstances. And that's what she finds herself in all the time.\"\n\nAuthor Sophie Kinsella said she never minded her works being described as \"chick lit\" by the media. (Photo by Stefania D'Alessandro/Getty Images) (Getty)\n\nBloomwood's further adventures followed in books including Shopaholic Takes Manhattan , Shopaholic Ties the Knot and Shopaholic & Sister .\n\nAlong with Bridget Jones author Helen Fielding and others, Kinsella's work was often branded \"chick lit\" by the media. She told the AP in 2004 she didn't mind the label, interpreting it as signalling a book that is \"fun, entertaining and might just have a happy ending.\"\n\nThe first two Shopaholic books were adapted into the 2009 film Confessions of a Shopaholic , starring Australian actor Isla Fisher.\n\nIllness and hope\ufeff\n\nIn November 2022, after experiencing symptoms including memory loss, headaches and balance troubles, Kinsella was diagnosed with glioblastoma, for which there is no cure.\n\nShe kept the news private until April 2024. In an interview with TV personality Robin Roberts aired a few months later, Kinsella said she was focused on living in the moment.\n\n\"I've already lasted more than the average. That's how we get through. We hope,\" she said.\n\nAfter her diagnosis, she wrote a novella, What Does It Feel Like , about a woman with five children who has brain cancer.",

(Supplied: Cyrus Vudrag)\n\nThey said the council was \"seeking further clarification\" on a range of issues, including food handling, cleaning, pest management, laundry operations and mould and moisture management.\n\nCairns miner Cyrus Vudrag said he had made a separate complaint about what he believed were hygiene issues at the camp to his employer in November.\n\nCyrus Vudrag works at a coal mine near the Coppabella camp. (Supplied: Cyrus Vudrag)\n\nMr Vudrag said, like many workers, the camp was a home away from home because he lived there for nine days of every fortnight.\n\nHe said while many miners worked 12-hour shifts which made cleaning difficult, he now brought his own cleaning equipment to the camp.\n\n\"I'm afraid to look under the bed,\" he said.\n\n\"There's mould that's in the rooms, and the condition of the bathrooms \u2026 there's no drains in the floor ways.\"\n\nA patch of what appears to be black mould behind a sink in a Civeo Coppabella Village room.

(ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nMr Vudrag said he had fallen sick with gastrointestinal viruses several times since he began living at the camp in 2022.\n\n\"It is a serious fatigue management and health issue that needs to be addressed,\" he said.\n\nHe said he felt illnesses that could come about because of hygiene practices could impact safety on mine sites.\n\nHe also raised concerns about mould in living spaces and instances of cleaning staff entering rooms without prior notice.\n\nCiveo investigates claims\n\nMr Vudrag said he had been approached by Civeo Coppabella Camp management after the letter.\n\nHe said they thanked him for his letter and advised that they would be looking for solutions to his concerns.\n\nThe Civeo Coppabella Village has more than 3,000 ensuite rooms. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nThe ABC has been contacted by other residents about conditions at the camp but many chose not to speak publicly due to concerns about potential repercussions from their employers or the camp.\n\nMr Vudrag said he was speaking publicly to improve conditions at the camp.\n\n\"Everyone's got to take accountability,\" he said.\n\n\"The occupants of the camp \u2026 they have to speak up.\n\n\"[The] squeaky wheel gets the grease.\"\n\nCiveo also operates a village in Moranbah, about 50 kilometres from Coppabella. (ABC Tropical North: Liam O'Connell)\n\nIn response to questions about the Mr Vudrag's claims, Civeo said it maintained \"robust accommodation, food safety, housekeeping and maintenance processes across all villages\".\n\nThe company said in a statement that it encouraged any residents with complaints to contact their onsite village manager.\n\nCiveo also said it was not aware of an investigation by Isaac Regional Council or \"any associated investigations by any regulatory body\" and that it had not been aware of any other claims from thousands of guests that stayed at its villages.",

It is much more: it is culture, tradition, work, wealth,\" she said in a statement.\n\nItaly's prime minister said the recognition honoured Italians and their national identity. (AP: Gregorio Borgia)\n\nMany cultures get recognition\n\nUNESCO meets every year to consider adding new candidates to its lists of \"intangible heritage\".\n\nThere are three types: One is a representative list, another lists practices that are in \"urgent\" need of safeguarding and the third is a list of good safeguarding practices.\n\nThis year, the committee meeting in New Delhi considered 53 nominations for the representative list, which already had 788 items.\n\nOther nominees included Swiss yodelling, the hand loom weaving technique used to make Bangladesh's Tangail sarees, and Chile's family circuses.\n\nIn Italy's submission, the country emphasised the \"sustainability and bio cultural diversity\" of its food.\n\nIts campaign noted how Italy's simple cuisine valued seasonality, fresh produce and limiting waste, while its variety highlighted its regional culinary differences and influences from migrants and others.\n\n\"For me, Italian cuisine is the best, top of the range.

Nothing comes close,\" said Francesco Lenzi, a pasta maker at Rome's Osteria da Fortunata restaurant, near the Piazza Navona.\n\nThe campaign noted how Italy's simple cuisine valued seasonality and fresh produce.

Everyone knows pizza. \"\n\nMr Lenzi credited his passion to his grandmother, the \"queen of this big house by the sea\" in Camogli, a small village on the Ligurian coast where he grew up.\n\n\"I remember that on Sundays she would make ravioli with a rolling pin,\" he said.\n\n\"This stayed with me for many years,\" he said in the restaurant's kitchen.\n\nAP",

    "text": "Grand Designs Australia has a reputation for featuring the grandest of designs, often with price tags to match.\n\nThe latest season of the show includes the most expensive in the series' history: Lorilie and Gary's $10.3-million concrete behemoth, Horse Shoe Hill.\n\nRita and James, on the other hand, had a budget of just $230,000 and eight months set aside to build their architecturally designed three-bedroom house in NSW's Hunter Valley.\n\nStream Grand Designs Australia on ABC iview Architecture Professor Anthony Burke is back with a brand new series of Grand Designs Australia following some truly brave home builders taking on the challenge of a lifetime.\n\nThat budget blew out to $320,000 and the build took three times as long as anticipated.\n\nBut their home is still one of the cheapest ever on Grand Designs Australia.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, it's also a sustainable home, built using rubbish including old plastic bags, milk cartons and sawdust.\n\nIn the depths of the housing crisis, and with prices continuing to rise, we caught up with them to find out how they did it.\n\nCity living to an intentional community\n\nBack in 2022, Rita and James decided to leave their life in Newcastle behind and bought a block of land outside the city for just $118,000.\n\nPart of the reason the block was so cheap was because it was a share of land in an \"intentional community\".\n\nFor Rita and James, this community is a planned residential collective where members with similar values and a commitment to sustainable living each have their own private house, as well as access to shared spaces on a larger property.\n\nBefore Rita and James decided to settle in an intentional community outside of Newcastle, they lived in five countries together. (ABC/Fremantle Media)\n\nRita says this appealed as the couple \"didn't want to be isolated on a farm\".\n\nThey also wanted their kids to \"grow up in a place where they can see the stars, where they can interact with animals, [and] be around neighbours and friends\".\n\nBut it came with two catches.\n\nThe first was that they were unable to get a loan to finance the build, forcing them to rely on their savings and help from family and friends.\n\n\"Under the arrangement that covers this community, we're shareholders in the company that owns the property and we have a licence to build on a site, but we're unable to use any of that as collateral,\" James explains.\n\nThe second was that the residents of James and Rita's community are expected to build houses that are sensitive to the environment, as part of their broader shared goal of sustainable living.\n\nResidents of the community meet once a week to discuss local issues. (ABC/Fremantle Media)\n\n\"We've got this philosophy about building with materials that are recyclable or biodegradable and zero-toxin,\" James explains.\n\nThis was also partly how they intended to keep costs low while building their dream off-grid home.\n\nThe decision to go against the trend of building larger was another calculated call.\n\n\"Every additional square metre implies more materials and labour costs. So there can be great savings in designing a more modest footprint,\" James explains, adding a \"house with 140 square metres provides ample space for a family of four\".\n\n\"Our bathrooms and bedrooms are a little smaller than the average for a new build but they are definitely comfortable and we have a large enough living space,\" James says. (ABC/Fremantle Media)\n\nThe design for their home, by architect Morten Pedersen, began with eco-packed concrete strip footings with demolition material in the mix, to minimise environmental impact.\n\nThis was to be followed by an earthen floor made from granite, pumice and locally-sourced clay, to help keep the house warm in winter and cool in summer.\n\nThe couple opted for a recyclable steel frame rather than timber, which was to be insulated in biodegradable and breathable wood fibre panels made from waste sawdust, before being finished with clay plaster on the inside.\n\nFor the internal dividing walls, they decided to use panels made from used soft plastics and milk cartons.\n\nEvery off-grid house needs solar and rainwater tanks, and they planned to install a composting toilet and double-glazed windows, with the entire building clad in corrugated iron.\n\nBig savings and a big workload\n\nWork began in July 2023.\n\nDespite being a novice builder trialling experimental methods and materials, James did most of it himself while working part time and staying in a nearby neighbour's shed.\n\nJames and Rita's tips Where you can, do the work yourself\n\nSet up flexible working arrangements where possible\n\nShop around and compare prices\n\nLook for free, used and recycled materials\n\nBe honest about your budget with trades\n\nBuild a solid support system before starting your project\n\nMeanwhile, Rita took care of the children and their pets at a rental property in Newcastle while also working full time and helping out on site whenever she could.\n\nJames's retired builder dad Steve and Rita's father Italo were also heavily involved in the project, and some of the couple's future neighbours and friends helped out over several working bees.\n\n\"One of the biggest factors [in keeping costs low] was that we contributed most of the labour ourselves,\" James says.\n\nRita says building their family's dream house involved two years of \"big sacrifices\". (ABC/Fremantle Media)\n\nThey also saved money by doing their research, comparing prices and buying materials themselves, from second-hand marketplaces where possible.\n\n\"And we'd often ask people: 'Is that the best you can do?'\" Rita says.\n\n\" There were people along the way who we didn't even know who were willing to reduce prices for us. \"\n\nUsing clay from the building site, Rita made tiles for the kitchen inspired by the pottery of her home country, Ecuador, with the help of the couple's children. (ABC/Fremantle Media)\n\nIn a couple of instances, the pair ended up with freebies \u2014 from the wood they used to build their deck, to some of the doors in their house.\n\n\"We'd [also] talk to suppliers to ask if they knew of anyone who had over-ordered material, and a few times they did,\" James says.\n\nDads Italo (left) and Steve (right) helped with many elements of the build, including making bricks by compressing soil and clay from the site, mixed with cement and water. (ABC/Fremantle Media)\n\nThe pair say having access to experts they knew personally was another way they were able to pull off their build on a budget.\n\n\"Our architect went above and beyond what he had to do to help us, with talking about different materials, and he was really aligned with [our sustainable] values,\" James continues.\n\n\"And we knew a plumber and an electrician and were able to call and ask for advice on how to do things in a budget-friendly way.\"\n\n\"It was a lot of human contribution and good intentions \u2026 and all the small things adding up \u2026 that made this possible,\" Rita adds.\n\nTwo years later, it's done\n\nWhile James and Rita have only been in their new house for a few weeks, they've found living in an intentional community to be much the same as a traditional neighbourhood.\n\n\"Except we have a better relationship with our neighbours,\" Rita says.\n\nThe corrugated iron James and Rita's house is clad in wraps over the edges, which should help keep out everything from bugs to bushfires. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Sally Griffiths)\n\n\"It's a human thing, to want to be connected,\"James adds. \"It's very easy these days to be isolated and an intentional community is a nice way of balancing that out.\n\n\"There's so much stigma attached to intentional communities, and of course there are examples where they're not very healthy or a bit odd.\n\n\"But I think the positives far outweigh the negatives, especially if you have young kids.\"\n\nThe wood fibre panels the couple used for their ceiling were made using waste sawdust. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Sally Griffiths)\n\nJames thinks of their house as a dream come true. Rita describes it as even \"better than a dream\".\n\nBut now the adrenaline is out of their systems, they're just starting to come to terms with the true price of creating it.\n\nJames says the earthen floor was the \"most labour-intensive and time-consuming\" element of the build. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Sally Griffiths)\n\n\"We made a lot of big sacrifices to get here. For two years, we couldn't show up for things, for friends \u2026 this house was our whole life \u2026 it's so consuming,\" Rita says.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, it was over.\n\n\"You feel so flat \u2026 it was a really weird feeling.\n\n\"It's like when people are about to have a baby \u2026 no-one prepares you for what comes after.\"\n\nThe finished kitchen, featuring the tiles Rita and her children painstakingly made by hand. (ABC/Fremantle Media: Sally Griffiths)\n\nThe couple have a message for anyone contemplating a project such as theirs.\n\n\"Check if your support network is solid before getting into something like this,\" James says.\n\n\"Building a house is a really big undertaking, and it's good to have some people to fall back on when you need a bit of help.\"\n\nAnd Rita says there's a plus side to doing this.\n\n\" You might be surprised with the willingness people have to help contribute to your vision becoming a reality. \"\n\nWatch the new season of Grand Designs Australia free on ABC TV and ABC iview.",

(ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\nThe ACCC found the merger would make it difficult for smaller insurers to remain competitive.\n\n\"Given the historical difficulties rivals have had growing their share in Western Australia, the ACCC is concerned that IAG would face insufficient competitive constraints post-acquisition,\" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.\n\nRAC WA is Western Australia's largest insurer and IAG is the biggest in the nation, with a portfolio including major brands like NRMA and CGU.\n\nInsurers to fight decision\n\nBoth RAC and IAG released statements on Thursday saying they plan to lodge applications with the competition watchdog to reassess the deal under the new \"mandatory control regime\", a new system for reviewing large mergers and acquisitions that takes effect on January 1.\n\nRACWA sells insurance operations to IAG RACWA has announced a 20-year deal with insurance company Insurance Australia Group, handing over its entire insurance underwriting business.\n\n\"While we are naturally disappointed with this outcome, we acknowledge the role of regulators and the process undertaken,\" the RAC statement said.\n\n\"We still believe the proposed partnership has merit and would be beneficial for our teams and members.\n\n\"RAC remains committed to pursuing the partnership and supports this next step.\"\n\nThe deal would see RACWA sell off its insurance arm, which generated $290 million in net income last financial year, but it would retain the Roadside Assistance branch.\n\nIn an interview in September, RAC Group chief executive Rob Slocombe said IAG had agreed to maintain a WA workforce, at least initially.\n\n\"Over time that may change as more technology comes in and various things change, but IAG has committed to keeping a significant claims handling presence here in Western Australia,\" he told ABC Radio Perth.\n\nIAG Managing Director and chief executive Nick Hawkins said the acquisition would \"enhance the RAC member experience and ensure greater resilience to industry challenges\".\n\n\"IAG and RAC have proven track records of successful partnerships and are committed to delivering competitive and accessible insurance products for all Western Australians,\" he said.",

    "text": "One of Australia's largest superannuation funds HESTA has been hit with regulatory action, after a \"severe, prolonged disruption\" that left 1.1 million Australians unable to access their funds for weeks.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has imposed additional licence conditions on HESTA, raising concerns about the fund's risk management and board governance during its transition from one outsourced administration provider to another earlier this year.\n\nAPRA said the transition, which led to a seven-week planned outage and ongoing problems for some members even after full services were restored, \"resulted in a severe, prolonged disruption to member services and caused direct harm to members\".\n\n\"While some disruption is unavoidable when changing service providers, APRA expects that any transitions are well managed and do not result in any unnecessary impact on members' ability to access their accounts,\" APRA deputy chair Margaret Cole said.\n\nIn a damning assessment of HESTA, the regulator said it had identified deficiencies in the fund's board governance and management of risks which rendered it inadequately prepared to effectively oversee and manage the transition.\n\n\"APRA's imposition of licence conditions mean that HESTA is required to take prompt action to address deficiencies. APRA will utilise its powers to hold trustees accountable to meet their obligations to members,\" Ms Cole said.\n\nHESTA customers are unable to log in to their accounts until June. (ABC News: Stephanie Chalmers)\n\nIn a statement, HESTA chief executive Debby Blakey said the fund took the matters raised by APRA \"very seriously and are cooperating fully with the regulator to resolve them\".\n\n\"We apologise to members who experienced delays during our transition to a new administration provider.\n\n\"Since the transition we have worked closely with our administration provider to seek to deliver the level of service our members expect and deserve.\n\n\"We are committed to implementing any potential improvements identified so we can better support our members now and into the future.\"\n\nThe superannuation fund will now be required to conduct separate independent reviews of its risk management framework and board effectiveness, to comply with its extra licence conditions.\n\n'Should be a lesson for all funds'\n\nIn April this year, HESTA underwent a planned outage that affected its more than 1 million members, as it transitioned its administration services over to a new platform, GROW.\n\nMembers were unable to access most services, including online accounts.\n\nSuper contributions and investment switches were unable to be processed until after the outage, as well as withdrawals and insurance claims.\n\nThe planned outage was announced in February, with HESTA's chief executive Debby Blakey describing it as \"the largest technology project in HESTA's 38-year history\".\n\n'Just gobsmacked': HESTA super outage A consumer advocacy group has called for transparency around why the seven-week HESTA super fund outage was approved.\n\nDespite the fund's communications, dozens of members who contacted the ABC said they were not aware of the outage until it had begun, with some only finding out about it in reporting.\n\nOne HESTA member came close to losing his home deposit after struggling to access his super during the planned outage, while another woman said she had to cancel surgery because she couldn't draw down on her superannuation fund.\n\nAnother man was concerned his wife would lose her place at a nursing home because he could not access super to pay the deposit.\n\n\"It's always a concern in the back of my mind, I'm visiting her every day, and it would be nice to have this part of it finalised so we can keep going,\" Glynn Lewis told the ABC back in June.\n\nConsumer advocates were scathing of HESTA's communications with members and conduction during the period of disruption.\n\nOn Thursday, Super Consumers Australia welcomed the imposition of licence conditions by APRA.\n\n\"This raises serious concerns about the HESTA board and executive's ability to look after their members. HESTA caused serious harm by failing to deliver basic services, with many unable to contact their fund for months,\" the group's chief executive Xavier O'Halloran said.\n\n\"People lost access to their money, faced extreme uncertainty and wasted time because of these failures.\n\n\"We heard from one grandmother who was forced to pick up her grandchildren on a bike after she was unable to access her money at HESTA to pay for urgent costs after her car broke down.\"\n\nMr O'Halloran said it should be \"a lesson to all funds going through similar transitions, they need to put members' interests first and properly resource their customer service\".\n\nSuper Consumers called on the federal government to implement mandatory customer service standards in super, \"to send a clear message to funds that they need to lift their standards or face serious repercussions\".\n\nAPRA said the independent reviews HESTA will be required to carry out will be comprehensive in scope and will consider the fund's management of the transition.",

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nMoore, who was 8-5 in his debut season and 9-3 this year, did not return a message seeking comment left by The Associated Press.\n\nThe 39-year-old Moore signed a five-year contract with a base annual salary of $US5.5 million ($8.2 million) last year.\n\nAccording to the terms of his deal, the university will not have to buy out the remaining years of Moore's contract because he was fired for cause.\n\nCollege football's most successful program is suddenly looking for a third coach in four years, shortly after a busy cycle that included Lane Kiffin leaving playoff-bound Ole Miss for LSU.\n\nMoore, the team's former offensive coordinator, joined the program in 2018 and was promoted to lead the Wolverines after they won the 2024 national title to succeed Jim Harbaugh when he returned to the NFL to lead the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe 18th-ranked Wolverines (9-3, 7-2 Big Ten) are set to play No.14 Texas on December 31 in the Citrus Bowl.\n\nMoore, in his second season, was suspended for two games in 2025 as part of self-imposed sanctions for NCAA violations related to a sign-stealing scandal.\n\nThe NCAA added a third game to the suspension, which were to keep Moore off the sideline for next year's opener against Western Michigan.\n\nMoore will now miss that game for another reason.\n\nHe previously deleted his entire 52-message text thread on his personal phone with former staffer Connor Stalions, who led the team's sign-sealing operation for the program. The texts were later recovered and shared with the NCAA.\n\nBiff Poggi, who filled in for Moore when he was suspended earlier this season, will serve as the team's interim coach.\n\nAP",

(Reuters: Eduardo Munoz)\n\nFor years, Beyonc\u00e9, a seven-time gala guest, has been one of the most-watched celebrities on the carpet, keeping everyone in eager anticipation of her (fashionably) late arrival.\n\nIn 2015, she made it worth the wait with a daring custom Givenchy gown that, with its strategically placed beading, gave new meaning to the term \"sheer\" and heralded the ubiquity of the naked dress trend.\n\nA year later, the superstar again wore Givenchy, this time in a gleaming, skin-tight latex gown.\n\nAnna Wintour oversees the star-studded event. (Reuters: Andrew Kelly)\n\nThe dress code for the May 4 event is yet to be announced, but it will dovetail with the theme of Costume Art, announced last month as the institute's next spring exhibit.\n\nThe exhibit aims to celebrate \"the dressed body\" as it appears in art through the centuries.\n\nIt will do that by pairing garments with objects from across the museum to show how fashion has long been intertwined with different art forms.\n\n\"It's a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\" the museum's CEO and director, Max Hollein, said in an interview last month.\n\nVenus Williams will host for the fist time in 2026. (AP: Evan Agostini/Invision)\n\nThe show, overseen as always by the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton, will be organised thematically by different body types.\n\nIt will include the Naked Body and the Classical Body, for example, but also less traditional themes like the Pregnant Body and the Aging Body.\n\nThe new exhibit will also have a splashy new home.\n\nCostume Art will inaugurate new gallery space occupying 1,115 square metres, right off the museum's Great Hall \u2014 giving fashion a prominent space in the museum and also helping to control congestion at the heavily attended exhibits.\n\nThe new Conde M Nast galleries \u2014 created from what was formerly the museum's retail store \u2014 will house not only all spring Costume Institute exhibits, but other shows from different parts of the museum.\n\nBolton has said the gallery space \"will mark a pivotal moment for the department, one that acknowledges the critical role fashion plays not only within art history but also within contemporary culture\".\n\nCostume Art opens to the public May 10, 2026, and runs until January 10, 2027.\n\nAP",

    "text": "It's Big Brother meets a late-night talk show, hosted by two of the WNBA's newest stars.\n\nIt might be slightly unconventional, but Natisha Hiedeman and Courtney Williams have built a platform that celebrates their unique personalities while giving behind the scenes insights into the WNBA.\n\nAnd the unexpected pair have highlighted what could be the future of marketing for female athletes in a digital age.\n\n'Representing the community'\n\nHiedeman and Williams are known as the \"StudBudz\" on Twitch, where they stream all aspects of their lives from the banal, including sleeping, to the ambitious 72-hour continuous marathon over WNBA All-Star weekend.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nAnd with their pink hair and infectious personalities, they've not only brought new fans to the league, but taken the term \"stud\" mainstream.\n\nBased in African American culture, it refers to lesbians, influenced by urban and hip-hop culture that mostly appear masculine or wear masculine clothes.\n\n\"We are representing the community, we got the gay community on our back, we are showing the world the gays are here,\" Williams said, speaking to SLAM Magazine.\n\nJust as Arsenio Hall revolutionised late-night television in the late 1980s and early 90s, the StudBudz are attempting to do the same in a very 2025 way.\n\nThe conversations are random, inappropriate at times, ranging from fashion to basketball to dating, and nothing seems to be out of bounds for the two.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThey have found the perfect platform to reach their audience \u2014 Twitch.\n\nIt has existed for over 10 years, coinciding with the emerging esports landscape.\n\nIt is a live-streaming site mainly used by gamers and content creators who can broadcast and interact with the audience in real time, and it has developed into a space where everyone can find their niche.\n\nAccording to Mark Johnson, a senior lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, there is no limit to the content available on the platform.\n\n\"You can watch people making music, [playing] pool, climbing mountains or playing piano or tabletop games \u2026 pretty much anything as long as it's legal,\" Dr Johnson said.\n\nFinding an audience\n\nAthletes streaming is nothing new.\n\nNBA players have been doing it for years, through the likes of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown and Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\nBut while most stream themselves playing a video game or sitting and chatting, Williams and Hiedeman bring something different.\n\nHiedeman and Williams have spent the past two seasons at the Minnesota Lynx. (Getty Images: Ellen Schmidt)\n\nThey have proven there is an audience for content driven by female athletes, particularly in sports which have been traditionally dominated by male athletes.\n\nDr Johnson said this could be the future for athletes.\n\nHe said a pre-established brand and audience could help cut through digital noise to create an online community by having a unique product.\n\n\"If you are a well-known sports person that could be you basically just being you,\" he said.\n\n\"People will be looking for you as the sports person to be much more your authentic everyday self than maybe the more curated self one might see in interviews.\"\n\nThe StudBudz stream started with a small audience and they have managed to grow it organically.\n\nThey had their breakout moment during the 2025 All-Star weekend, where they streamed non-stop for three days.\n\nWilliams was playing in the game, while Hiedeman was a spectator.\n\n\"All-Star was a movie, 72 hours, they had us booked and busy, to have everyone peek their head in and see how people are in their regular day, not just that competitive basketball lane,\" Williams told SLAM Magazine.\n\nWilliams said the WNBA was supportive of the duo, giving them behind-the-scenes access and highlighting their presence.\n\nThey took viewers into the dressing rooms, and all the parties where they danced and flirted with fellow WNBA players like Angel Reese, told world-renowned DJ Diplo what songs he should be playing and joked about how Caitlin Clark could get anything done with just a simple phone call.\n\nThey dominated the weekend and became the place to be.\n\nEven host broadcaster ESPN got in on the action, having the duo on one of their panels.\n\nHiedeman and Williams joined host broadcaster ESPN twice during their 72-hour live stream. (Getty Images: Steph Chambers)\n\nThe exposure saw them change from an \"if you know, you know\" account to \"you have to know\".\n\nWith 10,000 followers after two weeks, the pair jumped to over 70,000 followers after the All-Star weekend.\n\nBrand success followed with major endorsements rolling in, with everyone wanting to join the party.\n\nTheir success has not just been limited to brand sponsorships, with the duo creating their own line of clothing for the audience, generating another revenue stream.\n\nDr Johnson said newer social media and streaming platforms were a good way for female athletes to engage with an audience that was not already saturated with professional athletes.\n\n\"A good example here is the women's football World Cup and the Euros,\" he said.\n\n\"The fan base there is very young compared to the fan base for men's football, so those are going to be people that are much more tech-native and much more comfy with Twitch and streams \u2026 so I think it could be successful.\"\n\nBuilding beyond the court\n\nIt is something new Adelaide Lightning signing Sania Feagin is thinking about.\n\nShe hails from one of the biggest women's college basketball programs at South Carolina, also the school of four-time WNBA MVP A'ja Wilson.\n\nSania Feagin joined the Adelaide Lightning during the WNBA off-season. (Getty Images: Daniel Pockett)\n\nDrafted by one of the biggest WNBA teams in the LA Sparks, the 22-year-old is not only focused on her game, but the brand she wants to create.\n\nShe spent the past season with the Sparks at the same time the StudBudz found their groove.\n\n\"I know a lot more people are trying to get into content as in Twitch \u2026 but to see the inside world of WNBA players is actually very interesting,\" Feagin said.\n\n\"Maybe in a few years I'll probably get into streaming and stuff of that nature.\n\n\"It is fun to sit here and tell my story \u2026 if I have more opportunities to have digital ways of sharing my story, I would most definitely love to do it.\"\n\nAs for the StudBudz, they have no plans of slowing down, and have already shared dreams of going from the court to the Met Gala, the Grammys and beyond.",

    "text": "They\u2019re not the only ones. Kat Clark, who was named TikTok Australia\u2019s Creator of the Year in 2022, announced in April \u2013 five months after the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024 received Royal Assent and became law \u2013 that she and her husband Jonathan Clark would be moving to Los Angeles with their youngest daughter, 14-year-old influencer Deja Clark. Their oldest daughter, 22-year-old Latisha Clark, remains on the Gold Coast. Loading Kat said the move to the United States was so the family could pursue more opportunities, including brand deals and a lifestyle change. The family has not said it is because of the social media ban, though Kat has previously criticised it on TikTok. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to get hate for this, but banning teenagers from social media is not the solution because they\u2019re going to do it behind your back anyway,\u201d Kat said in a November 2024 video. The Clark family\u2019s move to the United States means they can access TikTok\u2019s Creator Rewards Program, which is not available to content creators in Australia. The fund remunerates eligible creators for publishing engaging content, and while exact figures vary, it\u2019s believed the platform pays between 40 cents to $1 per 1000 views.\n\nDeja\u2019s most recent video has more than 1.5 million views at the time of publishing. Creators have to be at least 18 years old to access the rewards program, but Deja\u2019s account is managed by her parents (all her public social media profiles have been since before the ban, for safety and privacy reasons). Parents managing a child\u2019s social media account is a workaround that some prominent figures in Australia, including 14-year-old vocal social media ban critic Zoey of @_heyitszoeyandmark, have used to keep their public accounts active \u2013 and earning. (It also means they can livestream on TikTok, which prohibits that feature for under-18s). Loading Australia\u2019s youngest Olympic gold medallist, 15-year-old skateboarder Arisa Trew, for example, has more than 190,000 followers on Instagram and 53,000 followers on TikTok.\n\nThe fact her father, Simon Trew, has been managing her public accounts since they started is perhaps why she can still post advertisements for her sponsor, chew lolly Zappos. While social media posts are not the only part of a sponsorship deal \u2013 for some competitions, athletes can be outfitted in branded clothing, for example \u2013 it is a critical element for brands who are trying to reach young audiences in particular, says Dr Adam Karg, a professor in sports management at Victoria\u2019s Deakin University. \u201cThey\u2019re financially absolutely worth less now for young athletes,\u201d Karg says of sponsorship deals for athletes under 16 with the ban in effect. A core tenet of a contract nowadays, Karg says, is social media posting \u2013 and delivering on that is crucial for some athletes to be able to continue pursuing their sport. \u201cIf you\u2019re an athlete from a low socio-economic background, the value provided by sponsorships is obviously really, really important,\u201d says Karg. \u201cA lot of athletes at the semi-professional and professional level, their full-time job is to train \u2026 this is an income stream for them. The sponsors essentially support them through the \u2026 day-to-day costs associated with their lives but also travel [to competitions].\u201d\n\nAlthough a workaround could be parents managing their accounts, Karg says because audiences know the posts are filtered through a gatekeeper, in the view of a sponsor who is buying an authentic message to young people from a fellow youth, that can devalue the young athlete\u2019s word. That personal connection is perhaps why, last week, 15-year-old Australian Olympic skateboarder Chloe Covell bid an emotional goodbye to her 325,000 Instagram followers who have \u201csupported [her] from the beginning\u201d. (Covell\u2019s account is still visible at the time of publishing, indicating that it has not been deactivated or suspended). The Australian Sports Commission is in contact with the eSafety Commissioner regarding the commercial interests and obligations of athletes under the age of 16. Loading On December 9, Swimming Australia released guidance for their athletes. It noted that athletes who are under 16 and have sponsorship agreements obligating them to make social media posts \u201cmight seek to renegotiate the terms of their agreement to require posting on a platform that is not caught under the new framework\u201d.\n\nHow plausible an option that is, the peak governing body says, remains to be seen, and it has advised affected athletes to \u201cseek specialist advice tailored to their individual circumstances\u201d. For some teenage social media stars, however, it\u2019s not just about the money. Leo Puglisi, who is now aged 18 but was 11 years old when he founded 6 News Australia, says it\u2019s clear from the online news channel\u2019s comments section that some of its followers would be affected (no current members of his team of young journalists are impacted by the ban). \u201cI\u2019m absolutely concerned that the ban impacts young people from being informed about the world from any news source, although my main reasons for opposing the ban continue to be privacy concerns, lack of consultation and the negative impact it risks having on many teens,\u201d Puglisi told this masthead in a statement. Musician Prashasti Jolly, 14, wants to create a solution for teenagers who use social media for professional purposes.

It was covered in the New York Times, the BBC, and carried in news bulletins from India to Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of their feeds or 'for you' pages, many affected teenagers found themselves locked out of some of their favourite apps and unable to create new accounts \u2014 for the most part.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuardian Australia reported three apps still allowed 14-year-olds to register accounts, although two had indicated they were in the process of implementing the new restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ten platforms , including Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, have all said they will comply with the ban, which requires them to block anyone under 16 from holding an account, after X announced on Wednesday that it would too.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne teenager said he'd been kicked off platforms owned by Meta \u2014 which include Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp \u2014 but still had access to Snapchat.\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers have spoken of trying to fool the age verification algorithm using makeup and other strategies.\n\n\n\nAlbanese, Communications Minister Anika Wells, and eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant all conceded that, while the ban would not be perfect in its early stages and there would be \"teething issues\", it would change lives as they went on a media blitz from Wednesday morning to the early afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make no mistake \u2014 this reform will change lives,\" Albanese said in Sydney while at an event marking the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For Australian kids, and allowing them to just have their childhood. For Australian parents, enabling them to have greater peace of mind. But also for the global community, who are looking at Australia, and saying: 'well, if Australia can do it, why can't we?'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 200,000 TikTok accounts had been deactivated, according to Wells, who said that while some may have circumvented the ban today, it did \"not mean they can avoid it in a week's time or a month's time\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because these social media platforms have to go back and routinely check under-16s' accounts,\" Wells told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech companies are expected to use a range of methods to verify a user's age, including face scans with artificial intelligence, sophisticated analysis of people's posting patterns and language, and digital IDs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are required to take reasonable steps to block children from accessing their services or face fines of up to $49.5 million per breach.\n\n\n\nSome platforms, such as YouTube, will still be accessible without an account, but it will be harder for algorithms to target content to children.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says the onus is on social media companies, not parents, to enforce the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle-known social media apps Lemon8, Yope and Coverstar remain accessible and have shot to the top of Apple's App Store charts.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the government has warned that the list of banned apps is dynamic and could expand to include others in the future.\n\n\n\nGlobal attention\n\nOther governments have said they are planning similar steps to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalaysia is among them, where the Asian nation's media outlets, including Focus Malaysia and the Malay Mail, referenced their government's own next steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban was leading a popular weekday afternoon program by United States broadcaster CNN, while being extensively covered by news sites.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Social media ban sparks creative evasion and digital ID security fears SBS News 06:01 English\n\nUSA Today wrote: \"Australia is the first nation to ban social media for kids. Is the US next?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BBC had live blog posts of the ban, with affected Australian children sending in their experiences and thoughts on the new rules.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl Jazeera noted both parents and advocates rejoicing over the ban, while pointing to the looming High Court challenge the government's laws are facing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingaporean daily The Straits Times considered whether Australia might set the precedent for other nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Europe, French outlets France 24 and Le Monde covered the rules, while Germany's Deutsche Welle also reacted.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, John Nash \u2014 a Conservative Party minister from 2013 to 2017 \u2014 wrote in The Times of London newspaper that Australia was \"making a brave stand\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Britain risked \"being left behind\", with the European Parliament and a number of European countries, including Spain, Italy and France, are considering similar measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission is developing a regional age-verification app with five member states to allow users to verify their age without handing personal data directly to platforms. Though critics have pointed out the policies wouldn't be binding like Australia's.\n\n\n\n\n\nRahm Emanuel, ex-chief of staff to former US president Barack Obama, said the US should follow Australia's lead on a similar social media ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's time for America to pick up its game and do the same. I think we need to help parents,\" he said in a video on Wednesday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our kids are way too vulnerable. It's too addictive, too alluring.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The global fault lines emerging over Australia's social media ban\n\nAmerican television star Oprah Winfrey has also hailed the ban while touring Australia. During her first show in Sydney on Thursday, she said: \"I think you\u2019re going to change the lives of an entire generation of kids who are going to have better lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has also been opposition in the US, most notably from the technology sector, where industry groups representing Meta, Netflix, Disney, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and others have lodged formal complaints with the US Trade Representative.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome experts have been divided over the ban, saying it will have positive and negative effects , while others have argued social media is an important tool for young people to have access to .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hi there, students. It's the prime minister here, and I want to speak to you directly about something very important, from December 10, if you're under 16, you're no longer allowed to have a social media account, you'll know better than anyone what it's like growing up with algorithms, endless speeds and the pressure that can come with that. That's why we've taken this step to support you. Above all, make the most of the school holidays coming up, rather than spending it scrolling on your phone, start a new sport, learn a new instrument, or read that book that has been sitting there on your shelf for some time, and, importantly, spend quality time with your friends and your family, face to face.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announcing the under 16's social media ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban currently includes Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and six other social media platforms, with the list expected to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom now on, social media platforms will face penalties of up to $49.5 million if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent children and teenagers aged under 16 from holding a social media account.\n\n\n\n\n\ne-Safety commissioner Julie Inman Grant says there will be early challenges, but non-compliance won't be tolerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There will be teething issues, and kids will be ingenuitive (ingenious), and they'll find their ways around it, but the way that we're looking at compliance and enforcement is around systemic failures, and I 100% believe that these companies have the technical capability to achieve this, and they may have come into this kicking and screaming, but now it's time for them to show us their stuff. We have to work with the platforms and make sure that they're continuing to innovate and improve. But again, if we see blatant non-compliance, or if we're challenged in court around our notices or any enforcement action we take, we'll take each step as it comes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Minister for Communications Melissa McIntosh says the Coalition is loosely supportive of the ban but is concerned about the use of the Digital ID system.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says they are concerned the biometric data within the digital ID framework is vulnerable to security breaches.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister McIntosh finds it disappointing the government is proceeding with the digital ID system despite its earlier vagueness about adopting it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Minister for Communications and the e-Safety Commissioner have started putting this sort of language in quite recently, around: messy. It won't be perfect. Please be patient. Well, they should actually just get it right. The platforms have to be held to account, and this is another part of the concern, and sorry, to put a bit of a damper on the day is around, they've told me that they will compel people to use digital ID and the minister saying they're not. But this is very personal information. Driver's licenses, birth certificates going into data centres offshore. So yes, we do support the intent, let's protect kids and let's get them off social media. But we can't forget all the mechanisms along the way, and ensuring that it does work the way it should do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, how are teenagers feeling about the ban?\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos are already being disseminated by some kids on how to bypass the ban, offering tips such as squinting your eyes during the digital ID photo verification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're living in Australia and you're under 16, stay. Everybody else leave. Gone, shoo, shoo, get out of here. All right, they gone? Hi. So, what you got to do to get past the social media ban? When it finally comes around to get past the facial scan, all you got to do, just do this. I don't know why it worked, but it did. That worked for me for Snapchat. I'm not sure if the different apps use different use different facial scanning, but that did work for Snapchat, so hopefully it'll work for everything else. All right, good luck, everybody.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome kids, like Barika, are worried they won't be able to stay in touch with family and friends from around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel a bit upset about it, because now I can't communicate with relatives overseas, and this has deeply affected me and I feel like I use Snapchat and messenger a lot, and since they have both not being banned it's kind of like breaking my relationship up, and that kind of hurts my feelings. I talk to them on Snapchat and Messenger. I use Snapchat for my cousins and messenger for like, grandparents, uncles and aunties.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTwelve-year-old Dorotea believes the ban will limit her creative expression because she uses social media platforms to make videos and art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how to explain it. It's just basically where you import, like, photos and videos, change the text, and it's like, then it then it kind of creates a video. I don't know how to explain it that well, without sounding weird.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot everyone is upset.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlossie, another twelve-year-old, says she spoke with neuroscientist Dr Lila Landowski who explained to her how malleable the adolescent brain is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a time when we're more likely to take risks, act on impulse and be shaped by the world around us. Social media is designed to take advantage of that. Every like, every notification, every short video releases dopamine. It keeps our brains hooked, even when it doesn't make us happier or healthier. For developing brains, that constant dopamine drip can actually change the pathways we rely on for focus, self-control and emotional resilience.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells claims the number of deactivated accounts indicates the ban is already a success.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Renters starting their retirement will need an extra $300,000 in superannuation to maintain the same retirement standard as those who own a house, according to a new analysis by Super Consumers Australia (SCA).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe superannuation advocate group has found that a single retiree who rents will need $659,000 in superannuation if they want to enjoy the same living standard as those who own a home and have $322,000 in super.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analysis from SCA earlier this month found that if a single Australian who has just started their retirement wants to keep their spending level at $1,690 per fortnight, they will need to have at least $322,000 in super by the time they turn 65.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group then swapped the spending of homeowners on their house \u2014 such as maintenance \u2014 with rental costs for renters, to calculate the savings they will need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The high cost of rent actually means people who rent in retirement need to spend 30 to 47 per cent more than homeowners to have the same standard of living,\" the SCA analysis says.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Calls for superannuation protections as some retirees could lose up to $205,000\n\nSCA deputy CEO Katrina Ellis, who authored the report, says the $300,000 gap reflects how much more it costs for a renter when they are retired compared to a homeowner.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says this has become \"an impossible financial problem\" for renters to solve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that home ownership is getting less and less across Australia, so there will be more people reaching retirement who are renting,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis also found a retiree couple who rents will need $786,000 in superannuation for a dignified retirement, compared to $432,000 for a couple who owns a home.\n\n\n\nRetired renters in financial stress\n\nFiona York, CEO of Housing for the Aged Action Group, says she\u2019s happy to see the retirement gap \"recognised\" by the SCA report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019ve known for a long time that there\u2019s a really big difference in renting as an older person compared to owning your own home,\" York told SBS News, adding that the issue is often overlooked in Australia\u2019s retirement housing system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that older renters are living in really expensive housing, it's often of poor quality, and this is having real impacts on their mental and physical health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said older women can be disproportionately impacted by the retirement saving gap: \"We know that older women have got less superannuation than men. They are more likely to be living in poor quality and expensive housing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYork has called for \"targeted strategies\" from the government to support female retiree renters, and more public and community housing to be built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the federal government updates the Commonwealth Rent Assistance Rate twice a year in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Ellis says the rate rise doesn\u2019t align with rapid rent increases, and suggested the government could raise it to ease rental stress.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the scheme, which can be available for people on certain welfare payments such as the Age Pension and Austudy, a single renter can receive the maximum fortnightly payment of $215.40 if their fortnightly rent is over $439.20.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, one in every three age pensioners who received the Commonwealth Rent Assistance in June 2025 still experienced rental stress, which means they spend over 30 per cent of gross income on rent.\n\n\n\nIssues won\u2019t be solved by 'moving around'\n\nThe SCA report also compares renters across capital cities on how much they need to save to share the same standard of living with homeowners in their cities by the age of 65.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Adelaide, a single person who rents a one-bedroom apartment will need $509,000 in retirement savings, while a Sydneysider in the same situation needs $794,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllis says the differences result from the varied rental prices. A single retiree who pays $380 per week for rent in Adelaide may have to pay $590 per week for an equivalent in Sydney, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even in the cities that have cheaper rents, we\u2019re seeing that renters still have more out-of-pocket costs than what homeowners do,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a cheap place to rent where this problem goes away. It\u2019s across all of Australia.\"\n\n\n\nFor those who are yet to reach retirement age, Ellis says it\u2019s important to have a plan around superannuation.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says while many young Australian workers will get at least 12 per cent of salary being put into superannuation, those who are retiring today would have received 9 per cent for much of their working life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So younger people are getting a larger contribution to super, which should help them save a decent superannuation balance by the time they retire,\" Ellis said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But hopefully by the time they retire, the government has also improved rent assistance and done the work to build more affordable housing, so that there's secure housing options for retirees who rent in the future.\"\n\n\n\n",

Other platforms could be added down the track.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were reports under-16s could create accounts on some platforms, subject to the ban as it came into force. They are required to take reasonable steps to block children from accessing their services, or face fines of up to $49.5 million per breach.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday the \"world-leading\" legislation was \"Australia showing enough is enough\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will make an enormous difference. It is one of the biggest social and cultural changes that our nation has faced,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it was a \"big change\" and the ban \"won't be perfect\", but there was \"success in the fact it's happening\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make no mistake \u2014 this reform will change lives,\" he said. \"For Australian kids, and allowing them to just have their childhood. For Australian parents, enabling them to have greater peace of mind.

    "text": "They\u2019re not the only ones. Kat Clark, who was named TikTok Australia\u2019s Creator of the Year in 2022, announced in April \u2013 five months after the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024 received Royal Assent and became law \u2013 that she and her husband Jonathan Clark would be moving to Los Angeles with their youngest daughter, 14-year-old influencer Deja Clark. Their oldest daughter, 22-year-old Latisha Clark, remains on the Gold Coast. Loading Kat said the move to the United States was so the family could pursue more opportunities, including brand deals and a lifestyle change. The family has not said it is because of the social media ban, though Kat has previously criticised it on TikTok. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to get hate for this, but banning teenagers from social media is not the solution because they\u2019re going to do it behind your back anyway,\u201d Kat said in a November 2024 video. The Clark family\u2019s move to the United States means they can access TikTok\u2019s Creator Rewards Program, which is not available to content creators in Australia. The fund remunerates eligible creators for publishing engaging content, and while exact figures vary, it\u2019s believed the platform pays between 40 cents to $1 per 1000 views.\n\nDeja\u2019s most recent video has more than 1.5 million views at the time of publishing. Creators have to be at least 18 years old to access the rewards program, but Deja\u2019s account is managed by her parents (all her public social media profiles have been since before the ban, for safety and privacy reasons). Parents managing a child\u2019s social media account is a workaround that some prominent figures in Australia, including 14-year-old vocal social media ban critic Zoey of @_heyitszoeyandmark, have used to keep their public accounts active \u2013 and earning. (It also means they can livestream on TikTok, which prohibits that feature for under-18s). Loading Australia\u2019s youngest Olympic gold medallist, 15-year-old skateboarder Arisa Trew, for example, has more than 190,000 followers on Instagram and 53,000 followers on TikTok.\n\nThe fact her father, Simon Trew, has been managing her public accounts since they started is perhaps why she can still post advertisements for her sponsor, chew lolly Zappos. While social media posts are not the only part of a sponsorship deal \u2013 for some competitions, athletes can be outfitted in branded clothing, for example \u2013 it is a critical element for brands who are trying to reach young audiences in particular, says Dr Adam Karg, a professor in sports management at Victoria\u2019s Deakin University. \u201cThey\u2019re financially absolutely worth less now for young athletes,\u201d Karg says of sponsorship deals for athletes under 16 with the ban in effect. A core tenet of a contract nowadays, Karg says, is social media posting \u2013 and delivering on that is crucial for some athletes to be able to continue pursuing their sport. \u201cIf you\u2019re an athlete from a low socio-economic background, the value provided by sponsorships is obviously really, really important,\u201d says Karg. \u201cA lot of athletes at the semi-professional and professional level, their full-time job is to train \u2026 this is an income stream for them. The sponsors essentially support them through the \u2026 day-to-day costs associated with their lives but also travel [to competitions].\u201d\n\nAlthough a workaround could be parents managing their accounts, Karg says because audiences know the posts are filtered through a gatekeeper, in the view of a sponsor who is buying an authentic message to young people from a fellow youth, that can devalue the young athlete\u2019s word. That personal connection is perhaps why, last week, 15-year-old Australian Olympic skateboarder Chloe Covell bid an emotional goodbye to her 325,000 Instagram followers who have \u201csupported [her] from the beginning\u201d. (Covell\u2019s account is still visible at the time of publishing, indicating that it has not been deactivated or suspended). The Australian Sports Commission is in contact with the eSafety Commissioner regarding the commercial interests and obligations of athletes under the age of 16. Loading On December 9, Swimming Australia released guidance for their athletes. It noted that athletes who are under 16 and have sponsorship agreements obligating them to make social media posts \u201cmight seek to renegotiate the terms of their agreement to require posting on a platform that is not caught under the new framework\u201d.\n\nHow plausible an option that is, the peak governing body says, remains to be seen, and it has advised affected athletes to \u201cseek specialist advice tailored to their individual circumstances\u201d. For some teenage social media stars, however, it\u2019s not just about the money. Leo Puglisi, who is now aged 18 but was 11 years old when he founded 6 News Australia, says it\u2019s clear from the online news channel\u2019s comments section that some of its followers would be affected (no current members of his team of young journalists are impacted by the ban). \u201cI\u2019m absolutely concerned that the ban impacts young people from being informed about the world from any news source, although my main reasons for opposing the ban continue to be privacy concerns, lack of consultation and the negative impact it risks having on many teens,\u201d Puglisi told this masthead in a statement. Musician Prashasti Jolly, 14, wants to create a solution for teenagers who use social media for professional purposes.

Picture: Jarrad Nolan/ ATSB\n\nATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said the pilot recalled feeling the aircraft suddenly pitch up, and observed the airspeed rapidly decreasing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cInitially unaware of what had occurred, the pilot believed the aircraft had stalled, and pushed forward on the control column and applied some power in response. But upon being told there was a skydiver hung up on the tailplane, they reduced power again,\u201d Mr Mitchell said.\n\nThe pilot reported violent control vibrations and said significant forward pressure and input were required just to keep the plane straight and level.\n\nThe bureau found the forward trim became jammed for the remainder of the flight.\n\nAs the crippled aircraft shuddered through the sky, 13 parachutists bailed out, while two stayed in the doorway watching the stranded skydiver fight to free themselves.\n\nThe skydiver used a hook knife to cut 11 lines and free himself from the tangled chute. Picture: Jarrad Nolan/ ATSB\n\nShocking footage captured during the emergency shows the moment the chute snags, the tailplane buckles, and the skydiver hangs beneath the aircraft as the pilot fights to keep it airborne.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDangling in the slipstream, the parachutist used a hook knife to cut 11 lines from the reserve canopy, eventually freeing the tattered material from the tail.\n\nThe skydiver, an experienced jumper with more than 2000 skydives, cut the lines in just 50 seconds despite significant difficulty.\n\nDropping into freefall, they then deployed their main parachute, despite it becoming tangled in the remnants of the reserve, and incredibly landed with only minor injuries.\n\nThey later reported cuts and bruising to their lower legs.\n\nOne camera operator was dislodged into freefall and sustained a minor injury. Picture: Jarrad Nolan/ ATSB\n\n\u201cWith all parachutists out of the aircraft, the pilot assessed they had limited pitch control, given the substantially damaged tailplane, which still had a portion of the reserve parachute wrapped around it,\u201d Mr Mitchell said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWith forward pressure they found they could achieve a gradual descent, and retracted the flap, which then allowed slightly more rudder, aileron and elevator control.\u201d\n\nMaintaining about 120 knots, the pilot declared a mayday to Brisbane Centre, advising they had minimal control and prepared to bail out if the aircraft became unflyable.\n\nJump pilots are equipped with their own parachute in case of such emergencies.\n\nBut passing 2500 feet, they judged they could attempt a landing.\n\n\u201cIn difficult circumstances, the pilot managed to control the aircraft and land safely at Tully,\u201d Mr Mitchell said.\n\nInvestigators noted the aircraft was not loaded within weight and balance limits, though this didn\u2019t contribute to the accident. Picture: Jarrad Nolan/ ATSB\n\nHe said the incident highlights the need for skydivers to stay vigilant around their parachute handles when exiting the aircraft.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cCarrying a hook knife, although it is not a regulatory requirement, could be lifesaving in the event of a premature reserve parachute deployment.\u201d\n\nThe investigation also found the aircraft was not loaded within its weight and balance limits, though this did not contribute to the near-disaster.\n\nFNFF\u2019s manifest software calculated weight, but not centre of gravity, meaning the aircraft departed outside its weight and balance ranges.\n\nThe pilot maintained control despite substantial tail damage and a partially wrapped parachute. Picture: Jarrad Nolan/ ATSB\n\nThe report also identified a second risk factor that the pilot did not use supplemental oxygen despite operating at or above Flight Level 140, as required by regulation, raising the threat of hypoxia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFatal parachuting accidents have occurred in the past due to aircraft being loaded outside centre of gravity limits, which highlights the importance of conducting aircraft weight and balance calculations prior to each load,\u201d Mr Mitchell said.\n\nIn response to the near-disaster, FNFF has since mandated hook knives for all jumpers, updated its loadmaster checklist, revised safety procedures, and issued oxygen reminders to pilots.\n\nThe Australian Parachute Federation is now developing a comprehensive loadmaster guide and new emergency-response training resources.\n\nThe footage of the incident will be incorporated into new nationwide training material for parachutists and loadmasters.",
