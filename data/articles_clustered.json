    "text": "The sky is overcast and threatening rain as women pour into Romancing The Novel in Paddington, flooding the narrow bookstore until there's barely room to move.\n\nThey're all on a 'book crawl' and they're all here for one thing: romance novels.\n\nRomance has been the most commercially successful fiction genre for decades and is reaching new heights in the 2020s, according to Nielsen BookScan data.\n\nWomen flocked to Romancing The Novel in Paddington last weekend for a Bound To Roam 'book crawl'. (Supplied)\n\n\ufeffMore than twice as many romance novels were sold in 2024 compared to 2019 and Australians spent more than $50 million on the genre last year.\n\nRomance \ufeffhas also been growing at an average annual rate of 49 per cent for the last three years, suggesting the figures could be even higher in 2025.\n\nAnnabel and Eliza, the organisers behind the Bound to Roam book crawl last weekend, made sure a romance store was their last stop for that very reason.\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\n\"All day our guests were saying they couldn't wait to go to [...] that they were saving their purchases for the female owned small business,\" Annabel told 9news.\n\nRomancing The Novel owner Scarlett Hopper, who is also a romance author, said she has BookTok (TikTok's book community) to thank for the boom in business.\n\nThe rise of online communities like BookTok has lessened the stigma around romance fiction, which was once considered \"taboo\" and has been dismissed as frivolous and shallow for decades.\n\nThe stigma is largely rooted in misogyny\ufeff, as romance is a genre predominantly written by and for women, but social media has shifted the narrative over the last five years.\n\nScarlett Hopper is a romance author and runs Sydney romance bookstore Romancing The Novel. (Instagram/@romancing.the.novel)\n\n\"Romance has always had a place in the world, people just haven't acknowledged it.\ufeff Now I think women are taking back the power,\" Hopper told 9news.\n\nThat's reflected in her sales, which have been high ever since she opened her Paddington store in September 2024.\n\n\ufeffSome of her regulars travel hours just to visit the store each weekend and many spend hundreds of dollars each time they drop in.\n\n\"It shows how much books mean to people, especially women\ufeff,\" she said.\n\nAnd Romancing The Novel is not the only store benefiting from the boom in romance book sales.\ufeff\n\nCaitlyn, owner of A Thousand Lives\ufeff Book Haven in the Yarra Valley, told 9news that \"people have been spending more and more on books\" over the last 18 months.\n\nREAD MORE: New autopsy reveals exactly how Gene Hackman died\n\nCaitlyn (left) with an author at one of A Thousand Lives Book Haven's reader events. (Instagram/@athousandlives.bookhaven)\n\nShe opened the indie romance bookstore in 2023 and cost of living pressures have forced her to raise prices recently, but customers have been happy to pay the difference.\n\nMany of the 700-plus titles she stocks can be found cheaper online from major retailers like Amazon\ufeff but Caitlyn says customers prefer buying from small businesses that offer an in-store experience.\n\n\"I think that hunger has always been there, we are just hearing more about it due to social media,\" she said.\n\nMany readers, including those on the Bound to Roam \ufeffbook crawl, are also seeking a sense of community which can only be found in physical spaces like a bookstore.\n\n\ufeff\"Even in a cost of living crisis, people still crave joy, meaning, and a sense of escape\ufeff,\" Eliza told 9news, adding that buying a print book in-store can fulfil that need.\n\nMany readers are also passionate about owning print copies of the books they love, some even purchasing multiple copies with different covers and bonus content.\n\nIn Bowral, Aussies are forking out up to $1000 in a single visit for special edition copies of their favourite novels at \ufeffBooks Ever After, run by romance author Kat T. Masen.\n\nAuthor Kat T. Masen's romance novel went viral on TikTok before she opened her store Books Ever After in Bowral. (Instagram/@authorkattmasen)\n\nShe realised the power of BookTok when her novel Chasing Love went viral and opened the store soon after in 2023.\n\nWithin a year, it had caught the attention of streaming giant Netflix.\n\n\"It was really my heavy presence on TikTok that pushed the store to the next level,\" Masen told 9news.\n\nNetflix \ufeffinvited her to be part of the festivities when hit series Bridgerton came to Bowral for its season three press tour in April last year, sparking a huge spike in sales and online interest for the small business.\n\nOne year on, she's already planning \ufeffto open a second location after proving with her first that \"brick and mortar is still very much alive\".\n\nEspecially since the interest rate cuts in February, which Masen said sparked a spike in spending from her Australian customers.\n\nOnline sales from US c\ufeffustomers have dipped due to US President Donald Trump's tariffs but that just gives Masen more incentive to grow her business locally while the romance boom continues.\n\nPanic on Wall Street as Trump announces new tariffs View Gallery\n\nNielsen BookScan's international book markets report showed that romance was one of the fiction genre with the strongest growth in 2024 and that's expected to continue in 2025.\n\nPhysical bookshop purchases rose above pre-pandemic levels, with more than half of Nielsen BookScan's tracked markets showing an increase in print book sales volume compared to 2023.\n\n\"For all of the people saying romance books are dead, my sales record proves otherwise,\" Caitlyn said.\n\nMeanwhile, romance readers are lapping it up and Annabel and Eliza have already locked in another book crawl in June with an even bigger turnout expected.\ufeff",

I'm working my guts out to ensure there's a majority government,\" Albanese said.\n\n\"I think this has really got the echoes of 2019, where the published polls are different to what we've seen,\" Dutton said.\n\nBoth leaders have led campaigns with cost of living crucial to almost all of their policies.\n\nUnlike in 2022, when Albanese ran a \"small target\" campaign and there were relatively few significant differences between the major parties' policy offerings, there are some notable contrasts this time around.\n\nHere are the main election promises made by Labor and the Coalition in the lead-up to the 2025 election.\ufeff\n\nREAD MORE: Where Albanese and Dutton have been on the campaign trail\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton at a press conference in Perth.

    "text": "There's something very charming about a pram jam: a jangle of buggies, yawning wide without their usual wiggly passengers, neatly lined up at the edge of the park and inviting a curious question \u2014 so, where did all the babies go?\n\nOver there! A convention of kids stretching along the edge of a new, green park, sitting neatly on blankets, nibbling decorously on the exquisite little snack boxes their mothers have made them as they all chat in the half-light of a cloudy Osaka morning.\n\nDoes anyone picnic as elegantly as a Japanese child?\n\nI stumbled on this scene on a recent trip as I went in search of what had been described to me as a near perfect example of an urban green development in one of the most green-starved cities in the world. (Yes, I like to look at infrastructure while I'm on holidays. I blame my engineer father, and the summer holidays spent visiting hydroelectric plants.)\n\nThere's something very charming about a jangle of buggies neatly lined up at the edge of the park. (ABC News: Virginia Trioli)\n\nThe sprawling metropolis of Osaka, which has one of those obscure \"sister city\" relationships with my city of Melbourne, partially opened a large urban park late last year near the busy centre, which takes in nine hectares divided by a busy road, with a curving elevated pedestrian bridge uniting the two parts of the park.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThere are water features, and grassed open spaces, cherry blossom trees of course, amphitheatre seating and an exhibition space designed by one of the greatest living architects, Japan's Tadao Ando. The second part of The Grand Green Osaka and Umekita Park opens next year.\n\nIt is a very beautiful space. You come upon it with relief as you escape the grey intensity of the city's largest rail station, and it opens up for you as a wandering path through lovely trees and around a calm open green that faces onto a curved covered event space.\n\nWalking into it, the impulse to sit and simply gaze on the green was overwhelming: like everyone else, we grabbed a (bad, sorry) coffee, found little chairs and simply sat and breathed.\n\nCulture is the canary in the coalmine: the designers, artists and writers always get there first, so it makes sense that the magazine Time Out opened a new iteration of its celebrated city markets underground at the Grand Green, featuring the best of Japanese food at a series of elegantly designed cafes and restaurants. Yes, it's a food hall with, of all things, a Melbourne coffee-inspired cafe. Maybe this sister city thing does work.\n\nThe area that is now The Grand Green used to be the old Umeda freight station before the city partnered with the private sector to create an urban space that includes commercial and incubation facilities as well as the park, hotels and residential units. I think that might explain all those prams.\n\nThe magazine Time Out opened a new iteration of its celebrated city markets underground at the Grand Green. (ABC News: Virginia Trioli )\n\nNow, the moment I mention old freight yards, I'm sure your mind has turned to the one nearest you: that ugly abandoned or under-used pile of old tracks, rolling stock and buildings, an eyesore on prime land usually right near the centre of town. You're right to think of it, because not only is it wasted, unsustainable space, your city now has an obligation, like every other one around the country, to turn it into small-scale residential housing sustained by open green space.\n\nMany cities are trying for something like this. Of course, everyone wants a High Line now, following New York's world-beating revival of an old railway line. Even Melbourne has fallen under its spell and has already invested millions in trying to replicate its success.\n\nI stumbled on this scene on a recent trip as I went in search of what had been described to me as a near perfect example of an urban green development. (ABC News: Virginia Trioli)\n\nI've always found it impressive and deflating in equal measure that this celebrated project is almost entirely supported by a volunteer army of locals who green and garden on roster. What disappoints me is that while the City of New York owns the High Line and the underlying viaduct, the Friends of the High Line manage and operate the park, largely funding it through private donations.\n\nSo, the city gets the greening, tourism and livability benefit without any ongoing project funding. That's just mean. Where's the state and federal money for something everyone benefits from?\n\nI live near the oldest city park in Melbourne, and it is now surrounded by residential units in the same way, and I am always amazed and delighted to see how intensely Flagstaff Gardens is used: by mums and their babies, young couples and their small dogs, city workers and their take-out lunch.\n\nEvery city wants something like the High Line park in Manhattan. (Getty/AFP: Spencer Platt)\n\nIt's the social exchange that as a country we have been lousy at making and offering: we will build homes for you, on a smaller and denser scale than you originally had in mind, but we will provide a beautiful and accessible green space that we will maintain well and that will connect you much more strongly with your community than any outer-suburban new tree-less mega-home could.\n\nIt's a proposition that requires the inclusion of the wonderfully talented architects, urban planners, landscape designers and sustainability and housing experts that I know we have in this country with a private sector that needs to be persuaded that their profit margin isn't the highest priority in a major project of urban and green renewal.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads in your inbox Photo shows Virginia Trioli in a stylish suit on a set with lighting behind her Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.\n\nThe proposition needs close and careful design of smaller scale homes within residential units that meet a family's real needs.\n\nAnd then, it requires very persuasive and credible people to communicate this idea to people and families who still resist giving up their dream of a stand-alone home on a quarter-acre block.\n\nIt is no longer fanciful to argue for this. In the face of entrenched political resistance to the taxation reforms that have put housing beyond many Australians' reach, then re-shaping how we build and develop, and the roles that city councils and state governments must play in that, seems more necessary than ever. And it is being done well elsewhere. You really can build it, and they really will come.\n\nThis weekend you have your choice of cookbook wars or election wars, amongst other things: both seriously high stakes battles.\n\nHave a safe and happy weekend.

I hope I get to do it all again for you.\n\nAnd if all the political noise around the TV gets too much for you tonight, whack in the ear buds and turn this up, and the world should disappear \u2014 just for a bit. Go well.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nVirginia Trioli is presenter of Creative Types and a former co-host of ABC News Breakfast and Mornings on ABC Radio Melbourne.",

    "text": "One of Australia's most successful fashion designers, Martin Grant, left Melbourne for Paris in 1992 in pursuit of an international fashion career.\n\nSince then, his namesake label has wooed everyone from Cate Blanchett to Emma Stone, Tilda Swinton and Lady Gaga.\n\nA major retrospective at Ian Potter Centre, NGV Australia, plots Martin Grant's extraordinary career \u2014 from the early 1980s to now, including supermodel Naomi Campbell walking his first ever runway show, to the elegant A-listers who became his inner circle.\n\nPolly Borland photographed Cate Blanchett wearing Grant in 1999, after she'd finished making the film Elizabeth. (Supplied: NGV/Courtesy Polly Borland)\n\nHis sartorial superpowers put his brand in the timeless category, and he continues to honour his formative influences to this day.\n\nMaking clothes as a teenager\n\nGrant is one of six siblings who grew up in the outer eastern Melbourne suburb of Blackburn. He adored his maternal grandmother Nancy who worked as a seamstress.\n\n\"My grandmother wore a beautiful camel coat, taught me to sew, and took us into town at the top end of Collins St.\n\n\"It all seemed very sophisticated and it's where I noticed all the well-dressed Italians and Greeks who had migrated to Melbourne and brought their sophisticated tailoring and caf\u00e9 culture to town. Those silhouettes really stood out and inspired me to want to make coats,\" he says.\n\nIntricate details and nods to history are part of Grant's signature style. (Supplied: NGV/Jessie Obialor)\n\nGrant would also lose hours scoping his mother's fashion wardrobe, a well-dressed woman who wore a YSL Mondrian dress made from a Vogue pattern the moment it was released. And he was raised by five sisters who took him under their creative wings.\n\nHe studied at Fashion Design Council (FDC), established in Melbourne in 1983 to support avant-garde and emerging designers. At 15, he was already making clothes. Those early slash-pieces, while tailored, were inspired by the punk movement.\n\nHis designs were part of an FDC runway show in Melbourne at the time, where other emerging and soon-to-become big names in fashion also took part including Peter Morrissey, Leona Edmiston and Fiona Scanlan to name a few.\n\nIt was while studying fashion that Grant made the switch to the Victorian College of the Arts where he studied sculpture; but he wouldn't go on to finish that degree either. He cut his studies short to relocate to Paris to try his luck abroad as many of his peers had done before him.\n\nFrom sculpturally tailored coats to trenches, and skirts that cinch at the waist in the nip of curvaceous time, Grant's pieces have always flirted between ready-to-wear accessibility and the hallmarks of couture.\n\nGrant's pieces are works of art designed to be worn. (Supplied: NGV/Courtesy Martin Grant)\n\nBut he doesn't describe himself as a couturier.\n\n\"What I do isn't couture, even though this dress has a couture feel. Couture is all hand-made, this is still ready to wear, with a couture feel and hand to it,\" he says.\n\n'A great creative moment'\n\nIt was Melbourne's clubbing scene where Grant made many creative partnerships and friendships that have stood the test of time.\n\n\"Polly Borland and I became fast friends at Inflations in the 80s,\" he says. \"Then I met Deanna Bond, who Nick Cave wrote his song Deanna about. We were the same age, 15, and clubbing together a lot,\" Grant says.\n\n\"Then I met Polly's younger sister Emma. I was already making fashion but then I started making clothes for Polly and she started taking photos around 1984 for me. That's when she photographed model Sophie Knox who is wearing a slash-back coat shirt that was really influenced by the scene at the time,\" he says.\n\nAustralian runway showcases recycled fashion Photo shows Woman in bright red dress sits on fluffy white couch smiling widely. A painting is above her head behind her. From repurposed quilt covers and op-shop treasures to hemp and cactus leather, sustainable fashion is proudly showing off at this year's Melbourne Fashion Festival.\n\nThe photograph was taken in a park near their apartment in Albert Park where they all lived. Hat designer Tamasine Dale was also in the same building, as were Knox and the Borland sisters.\n\n\"It was a great creative moment in Melbourne,\" Grant recalls.\n\n\"Then a few of us got studios in Stalbridge Chambers House in the city. I was 18, working hard designing. It was being around other designers, musicians, artists and architects that made it all the more exciting and really inspired me to do what I did,\" he says.\n\nLast year, Grant donated 200 pieces to the NGV, and half of those garments are part of this retrospective. A further 40 pieces came with him from Paris, unearthed from his archives there.\n\nThe last time he showed at NGV was in 2004. More than 20 years of new collection works are on display here for the first time.\n\nThe teenage tear-away stuck to his proverbial guns; he went from suburbia to Paris Fashion Week and lives to tell.\n\nDressing supermodel Naomi Campbell\n\nWhen Naomi Campbell walked for Grant in 1999, it launched him in Paris.\n\n\"I had opened a shop in the Marais, and American journalist Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley got me Naomi. The store was the size of a matchbox. I lived above it, and the next morning, I found a business card at the door by Head Buyer at Barney's New York saying, 'Call me,'\" he explains.\n\n\"I called her and she was told to come and see my collection. All the key editors were at my show including Vogue, Harper's and WWD (Women's Wear Daily).\" From there, US department store Barneys picked up his collection and Grant's profile started to grow.\n\n\"A lot of articles were written that said Naomi Campbell modelled for free, and who on earth was this designer that got her to walk on a strip of lawn in his shop! Andre [Leon Talley] was the one who encouraged me to do the show with Naomi. I didn't feel ready and he said just do it. I am glad I did,\" Martin says.\n\nGrant launched his first ready-to-wear collection at 16. (Supplied: NGV/Sean Fennessy)\n\n\"I met Andre through an ex-boyfriend, a British journalist. He is the one who introduced me to socialite Lee Radziwill. Sadly, they both died in the same year in 2019,\" Grant says.\n\n\"Lee and I became close friends after she bought a coat from Barney's. Mario Testino photographed her for Vogue in the first jacket she owned that I made. She told Andre she wanted to meet me. I designed the silver jacket for her that's on show at NGV. I called it the Radziwill. I made her entire wardrobe.\"\n\nAn artistic segue\n\nPerhaps like his friend Polly Borland, the time has come for Grant to segue.\n\n\"What I do isn't couture,\" Grant says. (Supplied: NGV/Josh Robenstone)\n\nBorland moved into making sculptures only a few years ago. A similar move for Grant is not off the cards.\n\n\"The sculptural side made me look at fashion from a different perspective and it definitely informed it,\" he says.\n\n\"I would like to make sculptures, now that I have more time, so yes, I am planning to do more things outside of fashion going forward.\n\n\"Watch this space.\"\n\n'Martin Grant' is at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Fed Square until January 26, 2026",

    "text": "They are among humankind's most impressive constructions, yet deep beneath the surface of some of the world's biggest dams lie the remnants of forgotten towns.\n\nOnce home to vibrant, remote communities, many of these towns were submerged underwater to make way for vast 20th-century infrastructure projects.\n\nHouses, town centres, petrol stations and theatres were moved or lost, stirring mixed feelings in the neighbourhoods that stood in the way of large dams.\n\nListen to the podcast Sunday Extra presents a lively mix of national and international affairs, analysis and investigation.\n\nThe wave of building was not limited to America, but took place in Australia too. And when locals moved elsewhere to make way for construction, the towns they lived in flickered out of existence.\n\nEventually they passed out of memory and into myth.\n\nBut now a small team of people is posing the question: could those lost stories be brought back?\n\nForgotten communities submerged underwater\n\nBob Reinhardt, an associate professor of history at Idaho's Boise State University, is the founder of The Atlas of Drowned Towns, a special project dedicated to mapping communities that have been buried underwater in the US and around the world.\n\nWhat started as a personal interest in submerged towns turned into professional study and eventually a mission to restore them to living memory.\n\nHis research began in the American west, where massive hydro-electric, irrigation, and flood control dams have been built.\n\nBefore: A birdseye view of Detroit, Oregan before it was inundated to make way for a dam. . .

(Supplied: The Atlas of Drowned Towns)\n\nDams are critical to supplying power and fresh water for neighbouring communities. But like all infrastructure projects, they come at a cost to the people in their path.\n\nThe impression Dr Reinhardt and his team were left with, after collecting oral histories from elderly folks who'd lived in Old Detroit and their descendants, was one of loss.\n\n\"[In Detroit, Oregon], which is my wife's grandmother's hometown, the spectrum of responses [to the dam project] ranged from disgruntled grumbling \u2026 to enthusiasm,\" says Dr Reinhardt.\n\n\"Often in many, many cases, there are people saying: 'Well, this is a sacrifice that we're making for the greater good. This needs to be done. And we understand our role'.'\"\n\nRecollections were punctuated by romantic notions about what the community used to be like and a sense of being part of something bigger.\n\n\"We [invited] people to come in and bring photographs and diaries and journals and newspaper articles and artefacts that they have, and then we scan all of it, and then we eventually upload it to the database for the website,\" he says.\n\n\"The sense that I got from all of those things that people brought in was \u2026 [that] this place was a complex community.\n\n\"Some people didn't get along with each other \u2026 It was a real community.\"\n\nWhile the town still physically existed, residents explained how intangible qualities like memories, feelings and certain sights were lost in the move.\n\nFirst Nations communities displaced by dams\n\nAmerican Falls in Idaho is another forgotten town that was submerged to make way for a dam.\n\nThe first recorded permanent settlement in 1800 was located on the west bank of the Snake River, which stretches from Wyoming through to the Idaho-Oregon border. Then in 1888, the town was moved to the opposite riverbank.\n\nIn 1925, American Falls moved again after construction began on a dam of the same name.\n\nIn 1925, American Falls became the United States' first town to be entirely relocated. (Getty: Keystone View Company/FPG)\n\nAn estimated 344 residents and 46 businesses, as well as three hotels, a school, and a hospital, were carted uphill on wheels from the original town site, making it the first to be entirely relocated.\n\nBut the biggest impact was on the Shoshone-Bannock people and the Fort Hall Reservation, which sits between the cities of Pocatello, American Falls, and Blackfoot.\n\n\"They gave up some of their land for the construction of the American Falls Dam,\" Dr Reinhardt says.\n\nIn newspaper articles and other period documents that he found in his research, the Shoshone-Bannock people are portrayed as \"pleased to be giving up more of their reservation\", he says.\n\n\"[But] reading between some of the lines and some of the speeches from the dedication of American Falls, there's a real sense of loss, and I would say buried betrayal.\n\n\"We're talking about the 1920s so it's not as though the Shoshone-Bannock could get up and say, 'We've been betrayed by the American government, this is a gross violation of our rights'.\"\n\nStream your favourite shows on the free ABC listen app Photo shows Image of Dr Karl on a pink background and Listen app logo Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks \u2026 and you don't need to be a scientist to find it!\n\nAn ongoing consequence of the dam's construction is that whenever the reservoir is close to full, it impacts other parts of the Fort Hall Reservation.\n\n\"Fort Hall is where some Shoshone Bannock continued to do their ranching, and so even to this day, they're continuing to give up land,\" he says.\n\n\"That's a big part of the story of the construction of large dams in the American West in the 20th century. And it's part of a bigger story of this longer history of displacement [and dispossession], whereby these places were seen by the government and dam-building agencies as [empty] because native peoples were forced to leave.\"\n\nToday, a 60-metre grain silo deemed too difficult to move is one of the few physical reminders of old American Falls.\n\n\"You can go to Google Earth and you can see the shadow of this thing in the water. It's pretty spooky and fascinating,\" Dr Reinhardt says.\n\nAustralia's forgotten towns\n\nWhile the Atlas is focused on America, it has recently broadened its brief to include other countries. Australia features on the map five times.\n\nIn the 20th century, Adaminaby, Jindabyne and Talbingo were submerged to create large reservoirs as part of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme.\n\nThe agricultural town of Old Adaminaby in the New South Wales Snowy Mountains was inundated in the 20th century. (Supplied: Anne Kennedy)\n\nResidents displaced by the scheme were compensated financially, but locals say the experience of getting kicked out of their home was like nearly being \"torn apart\".\n\n\"You often think about where you were brought up, but it's different than moving a house,\" Bruce Stewart, who grew up in Adaminaby, previously told the ABC.\n\n\"Getting kicked out of your own town, it's a different feeling altogether.\"\n\n'Bitterness will be there for life' Photo shows A historic photo of a house on wheels. The nation-building Snowy Hydro scheme came at a huge cost for the people of Old Adaminaby, some of whom are still lamenting their loss more than 65 years later.\n\nThe rural town of Bonnie Doon, north-east of Melbourne, is another example.\n\nIn 1953, houses and buildings from the original town site were moved to higher ground after the damming of Lake Eildon.\n\n\"Going across the bridge in Bonnie Doon after really dry summers in the 80s and 90s, you can still see the old road outlines [below the water],\" recalled Karen, the daughter of a former resident.\n\nWhy explore the history of lost towns?\n\nThe erasure of towns to make way for large reservoirs is often viewed by dam-building agencies as a clinical process, but Dr Reinhardt says there is an inherent spookiness to their disappearance.\n\n\"I was attracted to this [project] in part because of my wife's grandmother's story [and] I continue to be attracted to it because of some of the questions, the intellectual and academic questions. But there is a mystery [and] a romance [to these submerged towns],\" he said.\n\nDelving into their history recalls \"the value of inundated communities and the perspectives of people who call them home\" as well as the \"persistence of such places and people\", Dr Reinhardt writes.\n\n\"For me, it really is a question of, how did people leave a place they loved?\"\n\nWhen former residents of submerged towns or neighbouring communities get together to make sense of dam displacement, the answers they give to this question are far from simple.\n\nEach person's experience is unique, as is their relationship to the old communities.\n\n\"To create a space where people can have those kinds of connections, and for their stories to be valued is really cool,\" Dr Reinhardt says.",

Like that's a ridiculous question,\" Gilmore said.\n\n\"When I'm watching from afar, deep down there's still that burning desire like 'Oh wow, I wish I was in it'.\n\n\"I just love competing, I love performing \u2026 to come back and feel those emotions again, the nerves and excitement is really cool.\n\n\"I have achieved a lot of what I wanted to achieve in my career, but the cool thing about surfing is that the ocean always changes, and there's a lot of conditions that I know I have a lot of work to do to get better at.\n\n\"It's just about being able to improve all the time, it's an endless evolution of myself and my surfing and to be able to challenge yourself in a world stage.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

    "text": "Telaya Blacksmith may soon have a crucial decision to make about her sporting future \u2014 in addition to being a rising Paralympic track star, she is also a member of the Sydney Swans AFLW Academy.\n\nThe proud Walpiri teenager, who lives with an intellectual impairment, burst onto the track scene at last year\u2019s Paris Paralympics, where she qualified for the final of the T20 400-metre sprint.\n\nHaving already underlined her serious Paralympic credentials, it is Blacksmith\u2019s other love, Aussie Rules, that could tempt her away from the track.\n\nNot many athletes with disabilities, like Blacksmith, straddle both the elite disabled and non-disabled sports world; only about 20 athletes have competed at both the Olympic and Paralympic Games, including Australian table tennis player Milly Tapper.\n\nTelaya Blacksmith made her Paralympic debut last year on the track, but she also loves playing Aussie Rules. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\nDisabled people competing exclusively in non-disabled competition is also rare, but in women\u2019s sport a growing cohort is grabbing the spotlight and showing the possibilities for future generations of women and girls living with disability.\n\nAs Blacksmith herself told the Sydney Swans, \u201cat such a young age, I now feel like I can achieve anything if I work hard \u2013 it\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\n\nDisabled women across the world are further pushing the boundaries of sport, but what is it about women\u2019s sport that makes this possible?\n\nCarving out space\n\nFrom surfer Bethany Hamilton to footballers Mackenzie Arnold and Carson Pickett, many disabled women are making their mark in the sport they love.\n\nBut carving out space for any women in sport has taken time \u2014 spanning history, participation for women has been fraught with many challenges.\n\nIn a world where women have often been sidelined in sport, female athletes know what it is like to be marginalised and they understand the importance of embracing difference.\n\nMackenzie Arnold has embraced her hearing loss, as she goes from strength to strength as a goalkeeper. (Getty Images: Rio Giancarlo)\n\nThis was highlighted during the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, where win or lose, the Matildas were lauded as role models.\n\nWhat many didn\u2019t realise at the time was that Matildas goalkeeper, Mackenzie Arnold, was role modelling sports inclusion for young women and girls living with deafness and hearing loss.\n\nOnly months before the World Cup began, Arnold announced to the world via her social media that she had been diagnosed with hearing loss and required the use of a hearing aid.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nWomen\u2019s football, alongside other codes such as the AFLW, have embraced inclusion and diversity for years.\n\nUnlike men\u2019s sport, where instances of homophobia have resulted in many athletes, particularly in team sports, feeling like they couldn\u2019t be openly queer, women\u2019s sport has been more transparent about embracing the LGBTQ community.\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that there hasn\u2019t been any homophobia, or other discrimination happening in women\u2019s sport, but there is more an acknowledgement of solidarity between players, a courage to band together in the face of adversity.\n\nAs part of the queer community, like many in women\u2019s football, Arnold has been accepted for both her sexuality and disability, even as she learns to embrace her impairment.\n\nPickett making a mark\n\nArnold isn\u2019t the only female footballer who happens to be disabled competing for her country.\n\nIn 2022, Carson Pickett made history, becoming the first female player with limb difference to play mainstream international football when she debuted for the United States in a 2-nil win over Colombia.\n\nCarson Pickett, who lives with upper-limb difference, takes control of the ball for her team, Orlando Pride. (Getty Images: Alex Menendez)\n\nBorn without her left forearm, Pickett described her selection as a \u201cdream come true,\u201d and a challenge to who can and can\u2019t participate in mainstream sport.\n\nAware of her responsibility as a role model, she has used her profile to raise awareness of limb difference.\n\n\u201cWhile I know that I am confident and comfortable with showing my arm, I know there are so many people in the world who aren\u2019t,\u201d Pickett wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cDifferent people are my kind of people. The world needs more of that.\u201d\n\nWhile Pickett and Arnold are both proud to just be one of the players on the field, they represent a Zeitgeist moment for disabled girls and women; an acknowledgement that there are safe, anti-ableist communities in the world of sport.\n\nAfter her hearing-loss diagnosis, Arnold embraced the opportunity to advocate for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.\n\nGrowing up Arnold didn\u2019t have role models to follow, but she has said it is special to see different women, like herself, excelling in sport.\n\nAn arduous journey\n\nIt is encouraging to see women like Blacksmith, Arnold and Pickett participating in mainstream sport, but not every disabled woman and girl is afforded the same opportunity.\n\nAccording to Ausplay, more than 21 per cent of Australian women live with disabilities, but only 19.7 per cent of those women regularly participate in sport, compared to over 33 per cent of non-disabled women.\n\nFor many disabled athletes, such as Paralympic silver-medal-winning boccia player Jamieson Leeson, their choice of sport is very limited due to their impairments.\n\nJamieson Leeson and her ramp operator, Jasmine Haydon, won silver at the Paralympics last year. (Getty Images: Michael Reaves)\n\nDisability and Para sport is crucial to disabled people's participation in sport, alongside other disabled people or, in some cases, in mixed-ability sports.\n\nIn recent years, \u201creverse inclusion\u201d has led several traditional Para sports, such as wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby, to include non-disabled people in local games and competitions.\n\nMoving away from complete segregation of sports, particularly at a grassroots level, is especially important, whether it is reverse inclusion as above, or including disabled people in grassroots, weekend sport opportunities.\n\nFor many disabled people, mainstream community participation in activities such as sport can improve confidence and social connections, but at elite level it is harder to cross the boundary of participation without some adjustment by the sport.\n\nAfter losing her arm in a shark attack, Bethany Hamilton had to adjust her surfing style to continue competing in the World Surf League. (Getty Images: Sean M. Haffey)\n\nA promising young surfer, then 13-year-old Bethany Hamilton was involved in a shark attack, resulting in the loss of her left arm, seemingly ending her career.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case; only weeks after the attack, Hamilton was back in the water and before long claiming her place in the highest echelons of surfing.\n\nHer disability hadn\u2019t removed her skill as a surfer; it had simply created the challenge of how someone with upper-limb difference could surf well in the World Surf League.\n\nInitially, Hamilton rode a thicker long board so that she could improve her standing technique \u2013 balance is always an issue for people with limb difference, an issue even Pickett has had to contend with on the football field.\n\nBethany Hamilton is not only a well-known surfer, but also a disability advocate and role model for people with limb difference. (Getty Images: Matt Dunbar)\n\nHamilton\u2019s transition into competitive non-disabled surfing wasn\u2019t without its difficulties.\n\n\u201cCompetitive sports are such a challenging realm to be in because so much of it is so many variables, especially when it comes to surfing,\u201d she said on The Marie Forleo podcast.\n\n\u201cA lot of it had to do with progression ... really just pushing it in the ocean, in every realm of the sport.\u201d\n\nThis progression has led to Hamilton achieving impressive results at many international competitions, including placing 9th in 2022 Billabong Pro Pipeline.\n\nTaking away the stigma\n\nWhat Blacksmith, Arnold, Pickett and Hamilton all have in common is a drive to reach the top of their respective sports, and to also advocate broader for their respective communities.\n\nAnd while there have been disabled men who have competed in mainstream sport, such as footballer Alex Sanchez and ATP ranked tennis player Alex Hunt, who both live with upper limb difference, what feels to be missing in men\u2019s sport is an openness about disability that women\u2019s sport has embraced.\n\nWomen\u2019s sport does provide more support for people who are different, but as a paragon of inclusivity, does it diminish the value of disabled and Para sport for disabled women?\n\nMatildas goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold has become a role model for disabled and non-disabled fans. (Getty Images: Jonathan DiMaggio)\n\nPerhaps it comes down to ability and opportunity, and what athletes who can cross the boundary to non-disabled sport still do for disabled people\u2019s broader participation in sport.\n\nIt's something Arnold has embraced since her diagnosis with hearing loss, telling Prevention Australia, \u201cI hope people can potentially look at my journey \u2014 especially younger kids coming through and playing sport \u2014 and take away the stigma of being too worried to seek treatment.\u201d",

Got it Share\n\nOver-the-top burgers, fries served in metal baskets and neon signs were standard at the peak of the 2010s burger wave. Now, these same burger flourishes are the punchline in a widespread roast of \u201cMillennial burger joints\u201d on TikTok and Instagram \u2013 the latest salvo in Gen Z\u2019s sledging of Gen Y on social media. Stephanie Rose, a Melbourne food content creator who runs Instagram account @girlaboutmelb, says the hallmarks of a \u201cMillennial burger joint\u201d include charcoal-infused buns, truffle fries, mountainous milkshakes (also known as \u201cfreakshakes\u201d), sauces served in syringes and burgers stacked to the nines. \u201cI would say even Millennials cringe and find it funny now, myself included,\u201d she says. Burgers at 300 Grams, which are simple enough to cater to Gen Z\u2019s burger tastes. Paul Jeffers One post with more than 112,000 likes on Instagram meme page Middle Class Fancy, depicts uncomfortable metal chairs, a $7 truffle fries surcharge, exposed ceiling pipes, and waiters explaining, \u201cWe do things differently around here\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[It] nails the over-the-top vibe of the burger craze from about a decade ago,\u201d says Joe Farah, founder of 300 Grams, which has four stores in Melbourne. \u201cThink towering stacks, gourmet buzzwords and sauces that should\u2019ve never gone into a burger.\u201d More-is-more burgers with hefty price tags were everywhere in the 2010s. Supplied When competitive eater turned social media consultant Jesse Freeman opened a burger trailer in Sydney\u2019s northern beaches in 2023, he discovered those gimmicks were no longer so important to diners. \u201cPeople wanted simple, great-tasting and price-sensitive burgers, much like [American chain] Five Guys,\u201d he says. In the car park of a Brookvale brewery, Freeman\u2019s Dip It trailer now serves no-frills burgers like those found at US diners and fast-food chains. (Customers are still encouraged to dip those burgers in cheese sauce and gravy.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMister Gee founder Gee Ozgen with a \u201cCheese Boogie Deluxe\u201d at his restaurant in North Strathfield. Dylan Coker Gee Ozgen, who has been running Mister Gee Burgers since 2014, has also witnessed the evolution of burgers in Australia, noting that at some point, the innovation got out of control. \u201cThere was a push to be different,\u201d he says, adding that towering \u201cFrankenstein\u201d burgers (which could be loaded with more than one type of meat or use a doughnut for the bun) went too far. Many \u201cMillennial burger joints\u201d are still in business. With its penchant for \u201cbaconaise\u201d and truffle aioli, Queensland-origin chain Milky Lane is an exemplar of the form. Brennan Lukav, who runs the Burgers of Melbourne online directory, believes they largely reflect a much earlier scene. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a mason jar in about 10 years,\u201d he says. Burger blogger Brennan Lukav, who runs @burgersofmelbourne, says simpler burger shops are now in. Paul Jeffers Two of the most popular counterpoints to so-called Millennial burger spots in Sydney are Eat at Robs \u2013 a butcher with a grill plate, lean menu and $10.50 cheeseburgers in Rozelle \u2013 and \u201csmashburger\u201d specialist Chebbo\u2019s in Roselands and Marrickville. In Melbourne, Gen-Zers gravitate towards the old-school look and simple menu of Elmo\u2019s in Fitzroy North, and the stripped-back cheeseburger at Brunswick\u2019s Juanita Peaches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cost of living crisis is no stranger to young people,\u201d says Ali Chebanni, founder of Chebbo\u2019s. \u201cWhile Five Guys is a solid consistent option, I think the price factor really drives [them] out.\u201d A Five Guys cheeseburger starts at $19.90; Chebbos\u2019 burger costs $12. According to Chebanni: \u201cYou could define the typical Chebbo\u2019s customer as a young adult, 18 to 24 years old, coming either by themselves or with a group of mates to visit once a week.\u201d \u201cEven places like Gimlet and Maison Batard get it. Their burgers are stellar because they\u2019re straightforward and executed perfectly. It\u2019s proof that quality and simplicity are king.\u201d Joe Farah, owner, 300 Grams in Melbourne Most of the operators spoken to for this story agreed that value-for-money, simple menus, the convenience of online ordering and a brand that Gen Z can identify with are the key factors in today\u2019s most successful burger joints. Semi-permanent food trucks are popular too, especially on land where there\u2019s ample parking. In Sydney, Marcelo de Almeida operates his Marci Lou burger trailers in Dulwich Hill and Cabramatta, and says Gen-Z will \u201ccatch you out\u201d if the operator appears to be trying too hard. Instead, he says, \u201cthey care about the produce and where it\u2019s coming from. They care about what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Why Australia is hungry for a new wave of American burgers \u2013 and where to find them Another drawcard is riffing on well-known menu items from fast-food giants.

    "text": "\u201cThe controlling field umpire has blown the whistle for a ball up, He thinks that he\u2019s seen an Essendon player kick the ball away and has blown whistle again to pay a time delay free kick [then] the support umpire through the headsets, and I\u2019ve listened to the audio, has said, \u2018No, it wasn\u2019t Essendon. It was North Melbourne,\u2019\u201d Kane said. \u201cWhere a free kick is rightly being cancelled the umpires are instructed to ball it up. We can review it now and see that North Melbourne in fact kicked the ball away, and it should have been a free kick to Essendon. \u201cIn the moment, the instruction to the umpires, unless the support umpire is very sure, which in that moment he wasn\u2019t, the ball up is the outcome that we\u2019re after. We\u2019re just pleased that the free kick to North Melbourne was cancelled.\u201d \u2018No major breaks\u2019: Bomber gets positive news on gruesome injury Versatile Essendon tall Harrison Jones will not need surgery on his gruesome lower leg injury, but the Bombers have paid a hefty price for their thrilling win over North Melbourne.\n\nJones, who suffered a dislocated left ankle on Thursday night, underwent scans on Friday that confirmed a minor fracture in the base of his foot. The club has not placed a timeline for Jones\u2019 return, though he is likely to be out for weeks, rather than months. The 24-year-old injured his left ankle right on three-quarter-time during Essendon\u2019s clash with North Melbourne at Marvel Stadium. \u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d Jones told Channel Nine and Channel Seven reporters on Friday. \u201c[I] got CTs [and] X-rays last night. [There are] no major breaks, so it\u2019s a lot better than it could have been.\u201d\n\nThe 59-gamer said he was in shock immediately after the incident, which left his ankle pointing at right angles. \u201cI sort of looked down and saw my foot was the other way, and I thought, \u2018Oh, here we go\u2019,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt all happened pretty quick.\u201d Harrison Jones gets immediate treatment on the ground. Credit: AFL Photos The injuries to Jones, Jordan Ridley and Jade Gresham, coupled by narrow win for the Bombers after kicking just three goals after quarter-time, made for a dramatic night. Ridley suffered a high-level hamstring strain that will sideline the important defender for several weeks, the Bombers said, while forward Gresham will also miss next week\u2019s game against Sydney due to a low-grade adductor strain.\n\nInjuries are biting hard for the Dons, who have lost ruckmen Sam Draper and Nick Bryan for the season and are yet to see star midfielder Darcy Parish at all this season. Midfielder Jye Caldwell, though, is in line to return next week. In a game that should not have been in doubt after their first quarter but was absolutely in doubt right up until the last minute, the win came at a painful cost. \u201cIt was carnage there in the second half in particular,\u201d Essendon coach Brad Scott said on Thursday night. \u201cRidley has a hamstring, [a] fresh injury, unrelated to anything he\u2019s had prior \u2026 In his 100th game, we talked about his roller-coaster career. He\u2019s been a Crichton medallist. Clearly, we rate him extremely highly, and he\u2019s had to overcome some adversity, and he just looked like he was starting to get a free run and gets another injury. And Gresham couldn\u2019t come back on late with a bit of adductor tightness.\u201d Essendon led by 25 points at half-time, but the Roos adjusted, blocked space and dragged the game into a scrap. They then played with dare off half-back to trail by a point at three-quarter time.\n\nNorth lost Jackson Archer to a bad hamstring in the first half and were coming off a five-day break, but surged in the third quarter and kept winning territory in the last. Archer is now set to miss eight weeks with a high-grade hamstring strain. The Bombers, with strong presence from Nate Caddy and Peter Wright presenting for the ball, and Sam Durham and Mason Redman trying to support of superb skipper Zach Merrett, used the ball more thoughtfully coming from defence than the Roos. In the final minutes, first gamer Finnbar Maley, the son of former NBL player Paul, had the chance to put the Roos in front when he took a strong contested mark and had a set shot from 50 metres out. He had already kicked one goal early on \u2013 a lovely curled goal from long range \u2013 but this time he sweated over his kick so long the clock ran out. He was hurried into his kick which then fell short. The Roos get around Finnbar Maley. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThere were a lot of mistakes made in the game. It was not Finbar\u2019s fault,\u201d coach Alastair Clarkson said. \u201cHe will be disappointed. It\u2019s just him his humility would suggest he feels like he let the team down but he has not let us down at all,\u201d Clarkson said.\n\n\u201cThe football world want to judge us on wins and losses but six times this year we have been in the game at three-quarter time, this time last year it was zero.\u201d The Bombers need to mine their list for replacements. \u201cThe thing that I was really pleased with tonight was the resilience and the character of the group. We obviously had some adversity in the last quarter, and coaches are always loath to individualise, but we had some individuals that just stood up in big moments, players that we just couldn\u2019t take off the ground,\u201d Scott said. Clarkson, Hawks \u2018tracking the right way\u2019 in relationship rebuild\n\nHawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says Alastair Clarkson\u2019s decision to attend the Hawks\u2019 centenary match against Richmond is a sign the two parties are mending a strained relationship. Clarkson has had little to do with the club he won four premierships at as a senior coach since parting ways in 2021. However, he confirmed this week he will be at the MCG on Sunday, the Hawks having invited every player to have played at least one game for the club, along with past coaches and staff. Grand memories: Sam Mitchell and Alastair Clarkson were key cogs during a brilliant premiership era. Credit: Getty and The Age Mitchell said on Friday it was a positive sign Clarkson, now the North Melbourne coach, had opted to join the celebrations.\n\n\u201cHe is coming to the reunion this week, so that says to me things are tracking the right way,\u201d Mitchell said. Clarkson\u2019s relationship with the club was particularly strained during the racism saga which emerged in 2022. He, former club football manager and now Brisbane premiership coach Chris Fagan and former staffer Jason Burt all strenuously denied any wrongdoing. An AFL investigation found no adverse findings against the trio. Clarkson did attend the 10-year reunion in 2023 of the Hawks\u2019 2013 flag. But he and Mitchell have also had a fractured relationship, the former premiership captain having returned to Waverley as an assistant coach before replacing Clarkson in the top role. \u201cThere are so many great people from all of the eras. With Clarko being a four-time premiership coach, to have him coming along [on Sunday], and spend some time with the guys he coached, and do that sort of thing, there are so many great people from every era coming along,\u201d Mitchell said.",

    "text": "Prime minister accused of running scare campaign on pensions\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has categorically denied a Labor claim the Coalition is targeting age pensions, describing it as a \"shameful\" last-minute scare campaign.\n\n\n\nThe Coalition's costings include a line item to reduce overseas eligibility for social services payments to four weeks, calculated to make a saving of $74.3 million over four years.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister told SBS World News yesterday that the measure would target pensioners.\n\n\n\n\"If pensioners go overseas for four weeks, they will have their pensions suspended. That will impact many of your listeners, elderly Greek Australians, Italian Australians, Portuguese Australians, so many Australians who do share their time between Australia and the country of their birth,\" Anthony Albanese said.\n\n\n\nBut Dutton responded in an interview with SBS News saying that claim was untrue.\n\n\n\n\"It's just completely false and I think it's actually shameful the prime minister would seek to scare older Australians. It's just another lie out of this campaign,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We have no changes in relation to pensioners. In fact, there is more support we are providing to pensioners.\"\n\n\n\nWhen pressed to explain who the measure was targeting, the Opposition leader said the budget saving would come from targeting the parenting payment, which will be paid for a month when someone travels overseas.\n\n\n\n\"It relates to some people, for example, on parenting payments who can go overseas at the moment for six weeks, and we are going to reduce that to four weeks before there's any change to their payment, so it's actually quite a minor change and it doesn't apply to age pensioners.\"\n\n\n\nA Coalition spokesperson said: \"Age pensioners will continue to be able to travel overseas and receive the pension for at least 26 weeks, as per the current rules.\"\n\n\n\n\u2014 Anna Henderson",

    "text": "Young Australians are increasingly drawing on the 'bank of mum and dad' to get a foot on the property ladder as house prices continue to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut new data suggests parental loans are losing their conditions, almost entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nParents who contributed to their child's home loan deposit gave on average $74,040, according to financial comparison site Mozo who surveyed 1,019 Australian parents aged 18 or over. However, the number of respondents in this sample who had provided this support was unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Mozo, that was $4,113 more than in 2021. And 75 per cent of parents who had backed a deposit did not expect to be repaid, up from 33 per cent over the same period.\n\n\n\nWhile it's not atypical for parents to offer a financial lifeline, rising house prices are forcing them to dig deeper into their pockets.\n\n\n\n\n\nNational home prices hit a new peak in April, rising 0.2 per cent to reach $805,000, according to property research firm PropTrack's latest Home Price Index. Home prices in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin were all at record highs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than half the respondents in Mozo's reported dipping into savings to provide financial aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd about 19 per cent reported cutting back on expenses to help fund their child's home ownership aspirations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019re seeing some parents delay retirement, dip into savings, or even rely on credit cards and loans to support their children,\" said Rachel Wastell, Mozo\u2019s personal finance expert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Before offering that helping hand, it\u2019s crucial to make sure you\u2019re not relying on high interest debt and that your own financial future is secure.\"\n\n\n\nOther research has suggested parents who provide funds for their child's home loan deposit typically give $100,000 or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment manager UBS surveyed 1,000 Australian adults in December, asking whether they had received or given money to family members in the past 12 months. Almost 40 percent said yes, and of those, 25 percent reported the money was used for purchasing residential property.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 60 per cent of givers said they had transferred $100,000 or more to a family member to support their purchase. Although 80 per cent of those who received money for this purpose said they had been given less than $100,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Schellbach, equity strategist at UBS, told The Australian's The Money Puzzle podcast in January that it was no surprise the bank of mum and dad existed, but said the survey showed \"the magnitude and prevalence is possibly stronger than many would have suspected\".\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\"Sometimes, in politics I truly believe, you choose the lesser of two evils, because you're never going to get perfect. But right now, both sides feel equally bad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Jane (not her real name), a Melbourne-based voter, whose political inclination has undergone a major change in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told SBS News she had previously voted for Australia's two major political parties, or the Greens, in previous elections \u2014 but not any longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis election, Jane will again vote for the Animal Justice Party \u2014 a decision informed by \"years of research, a passion for animal rights and a close connection to people working within the campaign\".\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the Australian Electoral Commission shows that at the 2022 federal election, the Animal Justice Party received over 87,000 of first preference votes, around 0.6 per cent of the national total.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for Jane, a vote for a minor party is one that comes with stigma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Discussing your political affiliations with anyone right now seems like a landmine to me.\"\n\n\n\nPolicy over party\n\nGaetano La Macchia says he's \"a swing voter by nature\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've always said to people\" 'Look at the policy, don't look at the party. They're not football teams. You don't win anything when they win.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time though, La Macchia knows who he's voting for.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd unlike Jane, he's made his political views public, taking to the streets of Fremantle, Western Australia, with how-to-vote cards and flyers for one of the newest minor parties: Australia's Voice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party, which was established by former Labor senator Fatima Payman in 2024, has a focus on \"progressive reform\" across housing, education the climate and cost-of-living.\n\n\n\nFatima Payman and a volunteer campaign for Australia's Voice, which the senator says is a party that \"actually gets you\". Credit: Supplied / Gaetano La Macchia La Macchia said the government's stance on gambling is what led him to Australia's Voice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shift happened when his son was watching international football highlights on YouTube and started receiving gambling ads. He reached out to his local Labor member to share his concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is ridiculous that a 10-year-old boy wants to watch soccer highlights that happen in the middle of the night\u2026 and he has to be bombarded with ads for gambling .\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLa Macchia said he wasn't satisfied by Labor's response and started following Payman, who he believes \"actually has a backbone, has conviction\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Bill Browne, director of the Democracy and Accountability Program at The Australia Institute, it's part of a broader shift towards independent and minor-party candidates.\n\n\n\n\"Since the 1970s, there's been a dramatic increase in the number of people voting outside the two major parties, whether that's for a minor party or for an independent candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This might be linked to the apparent decline in the independence of major party MPs, who more frequently crossed the floor or spoke up in caucus meetings than they do today,\" said Browne.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowne \u2014 who co-authored a research paper titled The Steady Decline of Voters Choosing the Major Parties is Reshaping Australian Politics \u2014 believes the results of one election may set a precedent for those in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Ireland, for example, there was a big successful wave of independents being elected and then they saw even more viable independent candidates running and getting elected at the subsequent election.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Major parties seek to shore up votes\n\n'A cause worth fighting for'\n\nLibertarian Party spokesperson Gary Biggs said he had an unconventional journey into minor party politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was expecting a call from NSW Police after protesting against the COVID-19 lockdowns and border closures in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggs, who is the chief pilot of an aerial advertising business, said he flew his plane with a banner that \"literally said there's no COVID north of [the regional NSW city of] Taree. Why is the border shut?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, he received a call from Campbell Newman, the former premier of Queensland, who \"persuaded\" him to join the Libertarian Party Australia.\n\n\n\nGary Biggs (left) is competing against other major and independent candidates for the Queensland seat of McPherson, currently held by the retiring Liberal-National Party MP Karen Andrews. Credit: Supplied / Gary Biggs Newman also provided legal advice, which Biggs believes helped him avoid criminal charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Libertarians are appealing to a lot of people because we perceive the world to be becoming more and more controlling,\" said Biggs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWendy Spicer, a 60-year-old grandmother from NSW, is a volunteer for the Legalise Cannabis Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a one-policy party, calling for cannabis to be legalised, taxed and regulated in a similar way to alcohol and tobacco.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a cause worth fighting for. I feel like at this stage in my life, I have nothing to hide \u2026 and it [cannabis] has such a stigma about it that needs to be broken.\"\n\n\n\nWendy Spicer says she receives mixed reactions from the public while out campaigning for the Legalise Cannabis Party. Credit: Supplied / Wendy Spicer Spicer has been prescribed Cannabidiol (CBD) oil for insomnia and arthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party is calling for the legalisation of cannabis, including for recreation, modelled on the experience in the ACT where its limited use and possession has been legal since 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in 2023, Steve Robson, then president of the Australian Medical Association, strongly discouraged that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Legalising cannabis for recreational purposes sends the wrong signal to the public, and especially to young Australians, that cannabis use is not harmful\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Spicer says she has been advocating for the cause \"in pain\" due to fear of losing her driver's licence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn NSW, it's illegal to drive with THC \u2014 the compound in cannabis responsible for feeling 'high' \u2014 in your system, including when it's used as a medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria recently changes its rules, giving magistrates the discretion to determine if a driver was impaired when behind the wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile prominent issues this election \u2014 such as housing , health , education and the escalating rates of violence against women \u2014 are also top of mind for Spicer, she said her vote \"sends a message\" to the major parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The big parties are losing votes to Legalise Cannabis Party. We've already got seats in the state \u2026 those votes would have ordinarily gone to one of the majors.\"\n\n\n\nBrowne believes a vote for a minor party is not a wasted vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our electoral system should encourage a range of choices for Australians, and it should be up to them to decide whether an independent candidate, a minor party candidate, or a major party candidate is the best representative for them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Justice Party supporter Jane agrees:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think every vote counts and you can use that vote to make a difference.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

They also can't access Centrelink benefits. So effectively they are left and totally abandoned and forced into being some of the most marginalised people in our community, not for any act of their own, but because of government choices to deny them the ability to access appropriate, affordable healthcare, and also even to be able to sustain themselves through right to work through studying or even through access to Centrelink.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Asylum Seeker Resource Centre estimates there are currently around 100,000 people seeking asylum in Australia - one-third of whom do not have access to Medicare.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the benefits in the government's multi-million dollar women's health initiative include listing new medications, including contraceptives and endometriosis treatments on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, meaning only those with access to Medicare will benefit from cheaper medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investment also includes bigger rebates for complex health appointments and procedures, including relating to menopause and the insertion and removal of contraceptive I-U-Ds - this again only applies to those with a Medicare card.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor asylum seekers already confronting enormous financial and cultural barriers, women and trans people with complex health needs are often forced to make difficult sacrifices around health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Favero says the Asylum Seeker Resource centre's health service spends around $14,000 a month on pharmaceutical medications, such as asthma pumps or cancer treatment, that asylum seekers cannot afford without access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In particular with the Women's Health Initiative, we are talking about people seeking asylum who are women who are often women of color, who already have so many barriers in the system stacked against them. And this is another area where they're not able to access the services they need, the basic services that people should be able to access just to be able to live and sustain daily life. It's a whole reason ASRCs Health Clinic exists. We also have a specialised women's health clinic for such this reason because there are instances where women's health or trans health present additional complex health needs. If you don't have access to Medicare, you can't access that specialised medical care that you need, and therefore they're relying on charities such as ASRC to be able to provide that care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational students in Australia confront similar barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were more than 850,000 international students studying in Australia in 2024 according to the Department of Education - the majority do not have access to Medicare and are required to sign up for Overseas Student Health Cover, or OSHC.\n\n\n\n\n\nWen Li has been an international student in Australia since December 2021, and is currently completing her PhD remotely from China.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe co-authored a report at the University of Queensland, looking into the experiences of Chinese international students accessing Australia's health care system - research inspired by her own barriers to accessing health care, encountering financial obstacles and limited information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I first arrived in Australia, I found some inconveniences to the healthcare access and especially during my international studying period because at that time there was a covid and there was many negative reports from various media. So I think including me, many of my international friends had the same feeling of anxiety.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research involved interviews with 25 Chinese international students in Australia, and the key barriers were categorised at the individual, institutional and policy level.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the individual level, Ms Li describes students encountering language and cultural barriers which deterred them from seeing a doctor, while on the institutional level barriers are mainly related to costs of appointments, procedures and transportation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the policy level, students describe difficulty around the insurance cover and reimbursement system.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Li says the financial pressures resulting from this insurance are a key factor in reluctance for international students to access appropriate health care, as they must wait for reimbursement after first paying for procedures or consultations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am also kind of concerned about the costs that would be required for the process because I don't have much knowledge about the average cost for different treatments or consultations. But according to some of my friends, some costs could be incredibly high.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn their research, Ms Li says they encountered more women than men expressing a desire for psychological or psychiatric care - which is not covered by the overseas student health cover.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe would like to see this change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think more women students expressed a need for the psychological sessions. That is based on our interviews and also for myself, I think this is a very important service if that can be included in the insurance. Many women, student international students can be benefited from that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as failing to cover psychological care, there is a 12 month waiting period before the insurance covers pregnancy related care.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdele Murdolo is chief executive of the Multicultural Centre for Women's Health and points to the example of abortion care - explaining how for international students without cover during this waiting period, the costs of an abortion can be as high as $1200.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is in contrast to those with Medicare who can receive a free abortion at a public hospital or pay a few hundred dollars at a private clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it's a significant outlay, especially for a group that is already experiencing financial disadvantage vantage to be able to afford that. But the logical conclusion of restricting access to abortion are those two options where people seek perhaps medical abortion. Without that support of health professionals, they get perhaps medication from overseas or they just find another way. We know that in countries where abortion is restricted, the abortion rate doesn't go down. It's not that women have fewer abortions, it's just that they find other ways to get them. So they might have to travel further. They might have to, I guess, just find it in ways that's much more difficult to access.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's not just the financial strain.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lack of awareness and information means people on temporary visas often fail to receive the care they are legally entitled to - as Ms Favero explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Quite often people seeking asylum will present in hospital. The hospital isn't aware that people seeking asylum can access it for free. And then they sent a bill and we've seen people with bills for thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, which we've then had to spend a lot of time and education. We actually have a dedicated person in our health team whose whole focus is on advocating for bill waiver people seeking asylum. So while it's great that that is extended to other states, because not a lot of people know about it, it means that people are then receiving bills and are stressed or are too afraid to even present a hospital because they don't know they'll be seen for free in emergency situations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Murdolo says her organisation celebrates the government's $793 million investment in women's health, particularly noting the government's commitment to continue funding their Health In My Language program for another year - which provides in-language information on health for culturally and linguistically diverse people.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she says too often women sacrifice their health care due to financial and cultural barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe would like to see a newly elected government investigate the current visa system which excludes health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have had in the past a health system that doesn't discriminate on the basis of visa category. All of those types of healthcare, which is more at that preventative and early intervention end, save us money at the other end. So I'd really like to see a government putting some really kind of thorough investigation into separating out healthcare from visas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne step further, Ms Favero would like to see the next government guarantee Medicare for all people residing in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So absolutely so many announcements during the election campaign and beforehand. We even saw budget announcements a couple of months ago, and again and again, people seeking asylum are locked out of it because of their visa status, and they're not eligible for many of the services. Where there is increased investment, it is around that access to a safe net around being able to have access to study rights and work rights, because that is what enables access to Medicare and unlocks all of those other benefits that come with being able to access Medicare when you're living in the Australian community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Li would also like to see international students be able to access Medicare, but also calls for more culturally safe health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Especially for international students from non-English speaking countries, the cultural and linguistic barriers can be huge. The terms used to describe the symptoms, disease and drugs are somehow different from the daily language. They're used to a culture of having company for the medical visits. If the education institutions could provide some volunteers to accompany for some international students from this cultures, that'll be very helpful for those students, I think.\"\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\nOver-the-top burgers, fries served in metal baskets and neon signs were standard at the peak of the 2010s burger wave. Now, these same burger flourishes are the punchline in a widespread roast of \u201cMillennial burger joints\u201d on TikTok and Instagram \u2013 the latest salvo in Gen Z\u2019s sledging of Gen Y on social media. Stephanie Rose, a Melbourne food content creator who runs Instagram account @girlaboutmelb, says the hallmarks of a \u201cMillennial burger joint\u201d include charcoal-infused buns, truffle fries, mountainous milkshakes (also known as \u201cfreakshakes\u201d), sauces served in syringes and burgers stacked to the nines. \u201cI would say even Millennials cringe and find it funny now, myself included,\u201d she says. Burgers at 300 Grams, which are simple enough to cater to Gen Z\u2019s burger tastes. Paul Jeffers One post with more than 112,000 likes on Instagram meme page Middle Class Fancy, depicts uncomfortable metal chairs, a $7 truffle fries surcharge, exposed ceiling pipes, and waiters explaining, \u201cWe do things differently around here\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[It] nails the over-the-top vibe of the burger craze from about a decade ago,\u201d says Joe Farah, founder of 300 Grams, which has four stores in Melbourne. \u201cThink towering stacks, gourmet buzzwords and sauces that should\u2019ve never gone into a burger.\u201d More-is-more burgers with hefty price tags were everywhere in the 2010s. Supplied When competitive eater turned social media consultant Jesse Freeman opened a burger trailer in Sydney\u2019s northern beaches in 2023, he discovered those gimmicks were no longer so important to diners. \u201cPeople wanted simple, great-tasting and price-sensitive burgers, much like [American chain] Five Guys,\u201d he says. In the car park of a Brookvale brewery, Freeman\u2019s Dip It trailer now serves no-frills burgers like those found at US diners and fast-food chains. (Customers are still encouraged to dip those burgers in cheese sauce and gravy.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMister Gee founder Gee Ozgen with a \u201cCheese Boogie Deluxe\u201d at his restaurant in North Strathfield. Dylan Coker Gee Ozgen, who has been running Mister Gee Burgers since 2014, has also witnessed the evolution of burgers in Australia, noting that at some point, the innovation got out of control. \u201cThere was a push to be different,\u201d he says, adding that towering \u201cFrankenstein\u201d burgers (which could be loaded with more than one type of meat or use a doughnut for the bun) went too far. Many \u201cMillennial burger joints\u201d are still in business. With its penchant for \u201cbaconaise\u201d and truffle aioli, Queensland-origin chain Milky Lane is an exemplar of the form. Brennan Lukav, who runs the Burgers of Melbourne online directory, believes they largely reflect a much earlier scene. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a mason jar in about 10 years,\u201d he says. Burger blogger Brennan Lukav, who runs @burgersofmelbourne, says simpler burger shops are now in. Paul Jeffers Two of the most popular counterpoints to so-called Millennial burger spots in Sydney are Eat at Robs \u2013 a butcher with a grill plate, lean menu and $10.50 cheeseburgers in Rozelle \u2013 and \u201csmashburger\u201d specialist Chebbo\u2019s in Roselands and Marrickville. In Melbourne, Gen-Zers gravitate towards the old-school look and simple menu of Elmo\u2019s in Fitzroy North, and the stripped-back cheeseburger at Brunswick\u2019s Juanita Peaches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cost of living crisis is no stranger to young people,\u201d says Ali Chebanni, founder of Chebbo\u2019s. \u201cWhile Five Guys is a solid consistent option, I think the price factor really drives [them] out.\u201d A Five Guys cheeseburger starts at $19.90; Chebbos\u2019 burger costs $12. According to Chebanni: \u201cYou could define the typical Chebbo\u2019s customer as a young adult, 18 to 24 years old, coming either by themselves or with a group of mates to visit once a week.\u201d \u201cEven places like Gimlet and Maison Batard get it. Their burgers are stellar because they\u2019re straightforward and executed perfectly. It\u2019s proof that quality and simplicity are king.\u201d Joe Farah, owner, 300 Grams in Melbourne Most of the operators spoken to for this story agreed that value-for-money, simple menus, the convenience of online ordering and a brand that Gen Z can identify with are the key factors in today\u2019s most successful burger joints. Semi-permanent food trucks are popular too, especially on land where there\u2019s ample parking. In Sydney, Marcelo de Almeida operates his Marci Lou burger trailers in Dulwich Hill and Cabramatta, and says Gen-Z will \u201ccatch you out\u201d if the operator appears to be trying too hard. Instead, he says, \u201cthey care about the produce and where it\u2019s coming from. They care about what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Why Australia is hungry for a new wave of American burgers \u2013 and where to find them Another drawcard is riffing on well-known menu items from fast-food giants. With outlets in Melbourne suburban Prahran, Coburg, Richmond and Northcote, 300 Grams references Hungry Jack\u2019s (a burger called \u201cNot the Whooper\u201d) and the Golden Arches (\u201cMac Fries\u201d topped with diced onion and pickles). 300 Grams owner Joe Farah believes that the appeal of overworked burgers and venues has passed. \u201cThey\u2019ve been on the way out for a while now,\u201d Farah says, \u201cEven places like Gimlet and Maison Batard [both Melbourne fine-diners] get it. Their burgers are stellar because they\u2019re straightforward and executed perfectly. It\u2019s proof that quality and simplicity are king.\u201d\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox. Sign up",

    "text": "There is a plausible scenario in which Les Kiss could successfully follow Joe Schmidt as Wallabies coach.\n\nThe outline is as follows, with apologies sought in advance for the degree of bluntness used to convey the point: Schmidt, who is famously intense, rides the Wallabies hard for the next 17 Tests, builds a proper Test team, and then gets out just as his hard taskmaster ways are beginning to grate on the playing group, with good cop Kiss bringing a more relaxed vibe into the squad at precisely the point at which they need it.\n\nThat is effectively a cut-and-paste of what happened in Ireland, when Andy Farrell showed that replacing Schmidt is hard but not impossible, and should be in fact, viewed as an opportunity to enhance the team Schmidt leaves behind.\n\nYou\u2019ll note the lack of the word \u201ccontinuity\u201d in the above argument, for while Rugby Australia leaned heavily into that jargon-esque term in selling the transition plan this week, it\u2019s actually what separates Kiss from Schmidt that will dictate whether the Wallabies progress under his watch towards the Rugby World Cup in 2027.",

    "text": "\u201cThe controlling field umpire has blown the whistle for a ball up, He thinks that he\u2019s seen an Essendon player kick the ball away and has blown whistle again to pay a time delay free kick [then] the support umpire through the headsets, and I\u2019ve listened to the audio, has said, \u2018No, it wasn\u2019t Essendon. It was North Melbourne,\u2019\u201d Kane said. \u201cWhere a free kick is rightly being cancelled the umpires are instructed to ball it up. We can review it now and see that North Melbourne in fact kicked the ball away, and it should have been a free kick to Essendon. \u201cIn the moment, the instruction to the umpires, unless the support umpire is very sure, which in that moment he wasn\u2019t, the ball up is the outcome that we\u2019re after. We\u2019re just pleased that the free kick to North Melbourne was cancelled.\u201d \u2018No major breaks\u2019: Bomber gets positive news on gruesome injury Versatile Essendon tall Harrison Jones will not need surgery on his gruesome lower leg injury, but the Bombers have paid a hefty price for their thrilling win over North Melbourne.\n\nJones, who suffered a dislocated left ankle on Thursday night, underwent scans on Friday that confirmed a minor fracture in the base of his foot. The club has not placed a timeline for Jones\u2019 return, though he is likely to be out for weeks, rather than months. The 24-year-old injured his left ankle right on three-quarter-time during Essendon\u2019s clash with North Melbourne at Marvel Stadium. \u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d Jones told Channel Nine and Channel Seven reporters on Friday. \u201c[I] got CTs [and] X-rays last night. [There are] no major breaks, so it\u2019s a lot better than it could have been.\u201d\n\nThe 59-gamer said he was in shock immediately after the incident, which left his ankle pointing at right angles. \u201cI sort of looked down and saw my foot was the other way, and I thought, \u2018Oh, here we go\u2019,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt all happened pretty quick.\u201d Harrison Jones gets immediate treatment on the ground. Credit: AFL Photos The injuries to Jones, Jordan Ridley and Jade Gresham, coupled by narrow win for the Bombers after kicking just three goals after quarter-time, made for a dramatic night. Ridley suffered a high-level hamstring strain that will sideline the important defender for several weeks, the Bombers said, while forward Gresham will also miss next week\u2019s game against Sydney due to a low-grade adductor strain.\n\nInjuries are biting hard for the Dons, who have lost ruckmen Sam Draper and Nick Bryan for the season and are yet to see star midfielder Darcy Parish at all this season. Midfielder Jye Caldwell, though, is in line to return next week. In a game that should not have been in doubt after their first quarter but was absolutely in doubt right up until the last minute, the win came at a painful cost. \u201cIt was carnage there in the second half in particular,\u201d Essendon coach Brad Scott said on Thursday night. \u201cRidley has a hamstring, [a] fresh injury, unrelated to anything he\u2019s had prior \u2026 In his 100th game, we talked about his roller-coaster career. He\u2019s been a Crichton medallist. Clearly, we rate him extremely highly, and he\u2019s had to overcome some adversity, and he just looked like he was starting to get a free run and gets another injury. And Gresham couldn\u2019t come back on late with a bit of adductor tightness.\u201d Essendon led by 25 points at half-time, but the Roos adjusted, blocked space and dragged the game into a scrap. They then played with dare off half-back to trail by a point at three-quarter time.\n\nNorth lost Jackson Archer to a bad hamstring in the first half and were coming off a five-day break, but surged in the third quarter and kept winning territory in the last. Archer is now set to miss eight weeks with a high-grade hamstring strain. The Bombers, with strong presence from Nate Caddy and Peter Wright presenting for the ball, and Sam Durham and Mason Redman trying to support of superb skipper Zach Merrett, used the ball more thoughtfully coming from defence than the Roos. In the final minutes, first gamer Finnbar Maley, the son of former NBL player Paul, had the chance to put the Roos in front when he took a strong contested mark and had a set shot from 50 metres out. He had already kicked one goal early on \u2013 a lovely curled goal from long range \u2013 but this time he sweated over his kick so long the clock ran out. He was hurried into his kick which then fell short. The Roos get around Finnbar Maley. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThere were a lot of mistakes made in the game. It was not Finbar\u2019s fault,\u201d coach Alastair Clarkson said. \u201cHe will be disappointed. It\u2019s just him his humility would suggest he feels like he let the team down but he has not let us down at all,\u201d Clarkson said.\n\n\u201cThe football world want to judge us on wins and losses but six times this year we have been in the game at three-quarter time, this time last year it was zero.\u201d The Bombers need to mine their list for replacements. \u201cThe thing that I was really pleased with tonight was the resilience and the character of the group. We obviously had some adversity in the last quarter, and coaches are always loath to individualise, but we had some individuals that just stood up in big moments, players that we just couldn\u2019t take off the ground,\u201d Scott said. Clarkson, Hawks \u2018tracking the right way\u2019 in relationship rebuild\n\nHawthorn coach Sam Mitchell says Alastair Clarkson\u2019s decision to attend the Hawks\u2019 centenary match against Richmond is a sign the two parties are mending a strained relationship. Clarkson has had little to do with the club he won four premierships at as a senior coach since parting ways in 2021. However, he confirmed this week he will be at the MCG on Sunday, the Hawks having invited every player to have played at least one game for the club, along with past coaches and staff. Grand memories: Sam Mitchell and Alastair Clarkson were key cogs during a brilliant premiership era. Credit: Getty and The Age Mitchell said on Friday it was a positive sign Clarkson, now the North Melbourne coach, had opted to join the celebrations.\n\n\u201cHe is coming to the reunion this week, so that says to me things are tracking the right way,\u201d Mitchell said. Clarkson\u2019s relationship with the club was particularly strained during the racism saga which emerged in 2022. He, former club football manager and now Brisbane premiership coach Chris Fagan and former staffer Jason Burt all strenuously denied any wrongdoing. An AFL investigation found no adverse findings against the trio. Clarkson did attend the 10-year reunion in 2023 of the Hawks\u2019 2013 flag. But he and Mitchell have also had a fractured relationship, the former premiership captain having returned to Waverley as an assistant coach before replacing Clarkson in the top role. \u201cThere are so many great people from all of the eras. With Clarko being a four-time premiership coach, to have him coming along [on Sunday], and spend some time with the guys he coached, and do that sort of thing, there are so many great people from every era coming along,\u201d Mitchell said.",
