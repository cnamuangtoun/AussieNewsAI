(Getty)\n\nAll direct communication must include a disclaimer\ufeff\n\nLegally, gambling companies are required to include just two things in direct marketing material like texts: consistent \ufeffmessaging about the risks and potential harm of gambling, and a way for consumers to opt out.\n\nThat means all texts must include specific taglines like \"chances are you're about to lose'\"and a link or instructions to unsubscribe.\n\nBetting companies can also only send direct marketing materials to \ufeffcustomers who provide \"express consent\" to receive it, per the National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering.\n\nCompanies that send texts after a consumer has unsubscribed are in breach of the Australian Communications and Media Authority's spam rules\n\nEarlier this year \ufeff Tabcorp copped a $4 million fine for spamming VIP customers with thousands of messages without any way to unsubscribe.\n\nIn 2022, Sportsbet was ordered to pay \ufeff$3.7 million in fines for sending more than 150,000 texts and emails to about 37,000 customers who had tried to unsubscribe.\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nTabcorp was found to have breached the Australian Communications and Media Authority's spam rules. (Supplied)\n\nWhy are text messages treated differently to other media, such as TV ads?\ufeff\n\nBut because texts count as private messages\ufeff, they can skirt around most public gambling advertising restrictions.\n\n\"One of the big issues here is the rise of smartphones,\" associate professor at CQUniversity's Experimental Gambling Research Laboratory Alex Russell told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"Everyone's got a smartphone in their pocket all the time, and you can bet on that all the time.\"\n\nAnd betting companies can reach customers all the time via texts.\n\nTexts which have been shown to influence consumers to place more bets, larger bets, and riskier bets according to Australian research.\n\nIn a 2018 survey from the \ufeffVictorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, sports bettors received an average of 2.3 texts per week and race bettors averaged \ufeff4.3 texts per week.\n\nSports bettors received an average of 2.3 texts per week from gambling operators. (Getty)\n\nThe texts often included incentives to bet, such as bonus bets and reward points.\ufeff\n\nIn most cases, bettors who received a text responded by placing a bet with the operator that sent it.\n\nThey were also influenced to place more bets, place unplanned bets, make \ufeffimpulsive betting decisions and bet more than planned.\n\n\"We do see that people are targeted more if they are more likely to lose,\" Russell added.\n\n\"So if you're getting offers, it's probably because it's good value for them [gambling companies] to send it to you, because you're going to bet and lose.\"\n\nHow much money are Aussies gamblers losing?\n\nAustralians are the biggest gambling losers in the world per capita, losing about $32 billion annually; more than governments spend on aged care in Australia.\n\nNearly 3.5 million Aussies admitted they are problem or at-risk gamblers in a recent study\n\nThe number of problem gamblers has also risen by 22 per cent since last year.\n\nAnd the losses don't just affect the individual who is gambling.\n\n\"A hell of a lot more people are harmed by gambling,\" Russell said.\n\nBut he questions how Aussi\ufeffes are supposed to break free from gambling addiction when betting companies are able to reach them with targeted texts any hour of the day.\n\nCalls grow for greater regulation around SMS messages\ufeff\n\nGambling reform advocates have called for more transparency and regulation around direct digital marketing materials like texts encouraging bets.\n\nLast year, more than 70 prominent Australians, including former prime ministers,\ufeff signed an open letter calling on the federal government to ban gambling advertising in accordance with the Murphy Report parliamentary inquiry's recommendations.\n\nIndependent Senator David Pocock was one of the signatories.\ufeff\n\n\"The evidence shows that partial advertising bans do not work,\" he told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"The Murphy Report was clear, the Government should immediately ban direct inducements, such as the bonus bets people are offered via personalised texts.\"\n\nSenator David Pocock was one of many prominent Aussies who signed an open letter calling on the federal government to ban gambling advertising in 2024. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nHe called it \"predatory marketing\" that targets Aussies on a losing streak and highlighted the government's inaction in the two years since the Murphy Report was released.\n\n\"There is wide support in the Parliament to ban gambling ads and to ban inducements, but it won't happen while the Prime Minister continues to bow to pressure from the gambling companies and the powerful vested interests who are making too much money off of the suffering of Australians,\" Pocock said.\n\nThe Albanese government has not committed to a ban on gambling advertising.\n\nLast week, the AFR reported the government is actually expected to abandon plans for a total ban on online gambling advertising.\n\nRussell fears it will only do more harm to already struggling Australians.\n\n\"How are you meant to not experience a problem when gambling is so saturated and everywhere?\" Russell said.\n\n\"How are you meant to get away from this?\"\ufeff\n\nThe Albanese government has not committed to a ban on gambling advertising. (Getty)\n\nHow to stop or unsubscribe from \ufeffbetting company texts in Australia\n\nGambling companies are legally required to include a way for consumers to unsubscribe from text marketing in any texts they send.\n\nIn some cases, consumers must text 'STOP' or a similar phrase to a specific number.\n\nIn others, they can click an unsubscribe link in the text and follow the prompts to opt out of text message marketing.\n\nAustralians can also register with BetStop , a free government initiative that blocks all licensed Australian online and phone gambling providers.\ufeff\n\nAfter joining the National Self-Exclusion Register\ufeff, online and phone gambling providers will not be able to send you marketing messages.\n\nHow to report spam texts from gambling companies\n\nIf you think a betting company has broken Australia's spam rules, you can report it to the ACMA by submitting a complaint form.\n\nSpecific spam texts can also be forwarded to the \ufeffACMA on 0429 999 888.",

    "text": "Being a famous rock star is a common dream, but a new study suggests achieving that goal comes with an early grave.\ufeff\n\nA peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health examined the life expectancies of famous singers compared to those who never reached the limelight.\n\nThe stars were found to die about four years earlier - even though overall, wealthier social brackets are associated with a higher life expectancy.\n\nFamous singers tend to die younger. (Getty)\n\nBut it's far from clear whether it's fame itself, the demands of the music industry, or the lifestyle associated with being a musician, which contributes to this heightened risk, explain the researchers.\n\nThe researchers compiled a list of 324 celebrity singers who were active between 1950 and 1990, and matched them with 324 non-celebrity singers for birth year, gender, nationality, ethnicity, music genre, and whether or not they were solo artists or in a band.\n\nOf the sample, 83.5 per cent were male, 61 per cent were from North America, and the remainder from Europe and the UK.\n\nThe pressures of public scrutiny were a possible influence. (Getty)\n\n\ufeffMost singers (65 per cent) were rock artists, followed by RnB (14 per cent), pop (9 per cent), New Wave (6 per cent), rap (4 per cent) and electronica (2 per cent).\n\nFifty-nine per cent of the singers were in a band, 29 per cent were solo artists, and 12 per cent had careers spanning both.\n\nAnalysis of the data showed that, on average, famous singers survived until they were 75; less famous singers survived until they were 79.\n\nFame could be as unhealthy as smoking. (Getty)\n\nWhile band membership was associated with a 26 per cent lower risk of death compared with going it alone, the inclusion of this variable didn't influence the overall effect of fame, as famous singers were still 33 per cent more likely to die earlier than their less well-known counterparts.\n\n\"Together, the analyses indicate that an elevated risk emerges specifically after achieving fame, which highlights fame as a potential temporal turning point for health risks including mortality,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"Beyond occupational explanations, our findings suggest that fame adds further vulnerability within an already at-risk group.\"\n\nThe heightened risk associated with fame is comparable to other known health risks, such as occasional smoking, which confers a heightened risk of death of 34 per cent, they said.\n\nA possible explanation for the findings may lie in \"the unique psychosocial stress that accompanies fame, such as intense public scrutiny, performance pressure, and loss of privacy,\" they suggested.\n\n\"These stressors may fuel psychological distress and harmful coping behaviours, making fame a chronic burden that amplifies existing occupational risk,\" they said.\n\n\"Being famous appears so detrimental that it overrides any potential benefits associated with high socioeconomic status. Again, this highlights the increased vulnerability of famous individuals, suggesting a need for targeted protection and support for this population.\"",

(Getty/iStock)\n\nWith that in mind, here's how to download your data, export memories and backup your accounts before the ban\ufeff.\n\nWhen does the social media ban start in Australia?\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10.\n\n\ufeffThe \ufeffeSafety Commissioner is already consulting with social media platforms that will be affected by the ban about their plans to \"prevent and remove underage account holders\" from that date.\n\n\"We expect age-restricted social media platforms to comply with the requirements once they take effect,\" the eSafety website reads.\n\nWhich social media apps are banned?\n\nThe list of 'age-restricted' social media platforms that will be required to adhere to the ban from December 10 currently includes:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nKick\n\nReddit\n\nSnapchat\n\nThreads\n\nTikTok\n\nTwitch\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\n\nYouTube\n\n\ufeffMeta's Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as Discord, Pinterest, YouTube Kids, and Roblox, are not included in the ban.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the crypto market is crashing\n\nWill my accounts be deleted or just deactivated?\n\nThis will depend on the platform.\n\nSocial media platforms are not required to delete those accounts, but some may.\n\nAccording to the eSafety website, age-restricted platforms \ufeffwill be required to stop under-16s from using any existing accounts or creating new ones from December 10.\n\nUnder the ban, age-restricted platforms are allowed to let under-16s deactivate their accounts and retain all the data associated with them.\n\nThey can then return to those accounts once they turn 16.\n\n\"But young people shouldn't rely on platforms to provide this option,\" the eSafety website reads.\ufeff\n\n\"It's best that they download any data they want to save, including connections, posts, chats, photos and videos \u2013 before 10 December.\"\n\nThe \ufeffeSafety website urges under-16s to take screenshots or download posts, chats, photos or videos they want to keep when the ban goes into effect.\n\nHow do I download my TikTok drafts before the ban?\n\nTikTok doesn't allow users to download drafts to their devices directly, but there is a workaround.\n\nIf you post a draft as a private video you will be able to save it to your phone's camera roll without anyone else seeing it on TikTok.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\nOpen your drafts folder Tap the draft you want to save In the editing screen, tap 'next'\ufeff Tap 'everyone can view this post' and change it to 'only you' Hit post to post it privately On the live video, tap the three dots in the bottom right Tap download - it will then appear in your camera roll\ufeff\n\nIf you want to download TikTok videos you've posted to your account to your camera roll before the ban starts, just follow steps six and seven.\ufeff\n\nDownloading TikTok drafts is as simple as posting them privately, then tapping 'download'. (Nine)\n\nCan I save my Snapchat Memories to my camera roll all at once?\n\nIf you don't want to download your memories one by one, you can request a Memories-only Snapchat export.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n\ufeffLog into your Snapchat account online here , or go to the 'Settings' section on the Snapchat app Select 'My Data\ufeff' Under 'select data to include,' click the 'export your memories' toggle on Click 'request only memories' Select a date range of memories you want to receive (the bigger the range, the longer the download will take to process)\ufeff Confirm your email address so you can be notified when your data is ready\ufeff Hit 'submit'\ufeff\n\nOnce your memories are ready, you'll get an email with a link that will allow you to download them.\n\nIt can take several days for Snapchat to process data requests, so make sure to get in well before the ban takes effect.\ufeff\n\nHow do I export Instagram chats and photos?\n\nThe best way to save large amounts of data from Instagram to your device\ufeff is through Accounts Centre.\n\nThe steps are as follows\ufeff:\n\nGo to your profile in the app and tap the three lines in the top right \ufeffTap Accounts Centre, then 'Your information and permissions' Tap \ufeff'Export your information' Tap 'Create export'\ufeff Select the profile or account you want to save information from Tap 'Export to device' Click into 'Customise information' and tick the boxes beside everything you want to save, such as comments, media (photos) and messages, then hit 'Save' Select a date range, media format and quality, and input your email Hit 'start export'\ufeff\n\n\ufeffYou will receive an email to notify you when your data is ready to download.\n\nAs with Snapchat, \ufeffthis can take time so make sure to get in early.\n\nWhat happens to my data if I don't download it before the deadline?\n\nIf under-16s don't download their data from age-restricted social media platforms \ufeffbefore the deadline, they risk losing access to it.\n\nAs they will no longer be able to access \ufeffage-restricted social media accounts from December 10, they will not be able to access or save the data associated with those accounts.\ufeff\n\nHow will social media apps know if I am under 16?\n\nAge-restricted social media platforms are responsible for identifying the accounts of under-16s.\n\nSome platforms will use existing data to confirm if users are 16 or older (e.g. an account that has been active since 2006 is unlikely to belong to an under-16).\ufeff\n\nSome may also require some users to prove their age, though the ways in which they do this will vary between platforms.\n\nAny methods \ufeffage-restricted social media platforms use to confirm users' age must meet Australia's regulatory requirements and respect privacy laws and digital rights.\n\nDiscord, Pinterest, YouTube Kids and a few other social media platforms have escaped the ban.

    "text": "Inflation jumped to 3.8 per cent in October, up from 3.6 per cent in September.\n\nThe largest contributors to annual inflation were housing (+5.9 per cent), food and non-alcoholic beverages (+3.2 per cent), and recreation and culture (+3.2 cent).\n\nThis is the first release of the complete Monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\nMichelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics, says it marks the transition from the traditional quarterly CPI to the complete monthly CPI as Australia's primary measure of headline inflation.\n\nAustralian statistician David Gruen says the transition to complete inflation data every month will give everyone a \"quicker read\" on inflation.\n\nHowever, he said monthly data was inherently more volatile than quarterly data, so that would take some getting used to.\n\nLoading...\n\nHe said the quality of the seasonal adjustments in the new monthly data would also improve over time.\n\n\"The benefit of the monthly CPI is that it's more frequent,\" Dr Gruen told the ABC.\n\n\"One drawback is that for about half the basket, we only have 18 months of data.\n\nForget AI. Here's a real Aussie bubble Amid global warnings of impending financial doom, APRA and the Reserve Bank are far more concerned about a home-grown bubble, one that's been taking in oxygen for almost three decades.\n\n\"So [for] the seasonal patterns, the usual period of time that we use for seasonal adjustment is three years, so we will be doing seasonal adjustment on some part of the basket with less than the ideal amount of information.\n\n\"[So] in terms of being confident about the seasonals, I think the complete monthly CPI is going to provide more information but the quality of that information is going to improve as the length of time expands,\" he said.\n\nThe data show annual goods inflation was 3.8 per cent in October, up from 3.7 per cent in September. It was only 1.2 per cent in June.\n\nAnnual services inflation was 3.9 per cent in October, up from 3.5 per cent in September.",

(Supplied: Helena Popovic)\n\nWith no time to waste, Dr Popovic researched all sorts of methods to keep him engaged as his condition progressed.\n\nOne treatment stood out to her.\n\nReminiscence therapy involves people with dementia talking about the past to try to stay engaged in the present.\n\n\"Luckily he still knew me but he was just so depressed, so I said to him 'what can I do to help, Dad?',\" Dr Popovic said.\n\nTickets booked and suitcases packed, the father and daughter globetrotters embarked on the trip of a lifetime to the other side of the world before Mr Popovic deteriorated further.\n\nThey stayed with Mr Popovic's cousins who cooked him his favourite meals like sarma, or stuffed cabbage rolls.

I could see the emotion in his eyes as he recalled it,\" Dr Popovic said.\n\nThe pair wandered around Belgrade reminiscing about \"the good old days\". (Supplied: Helena Popovic)\n\nMr Popovic's favourite food was kajmak, a variation of clotted cream spread on freshly baked bread.\n\n\"He hadn't eaten kajmak in decades and he just grinned at every meal, taking in his history,\" she said.\n\nReminiscence therapy\n\nMemory stimulation through travel is a concept explored by Hollywood superstar Chris Hemsworth in his new documentary A Road Trip To Remember, which launched on the Gold Coast this month.\n\nHis father Craig Hemsworth has early-onset Alzheimer's.\n\nIn the film the pair travelled back to Hemsworth's childhood home in Melbourne which producers re-furnished to look exactly as it did when they lived there.\n\nThe Hemsworths revisited Bulman, a remote Aboriginal community they had lived in decades ago. (Supplied: Disney)\n\nThe pair also road tripped to a remote Indigenous community in the Northern Territory where the family once lived.\n\nThere they connected with friends they had not seen in decades and engaged in the nostalgic sights, sounds and smells of the Australian outback.\n\nIn 2025 there are more than 433,000 Australians living with dementia, and the illness is now the leading cause of death for Australians, according to Dementia Australia.\n\nDementia Australia client services director Barbra Williams said socialising and connecting through meaningful experiences, like reminiscing the past, can help delay dementia and its progression for those already living with the illness.\n\n\"Reminiscing can improve a person's sense of wellbeing and belonging. It helps them understand their place in the world and their value to their family and social network,\" she said.\n\nChris Hemsworth took his father on a trip down memory lane to try to combat his Alzheimer's symptoms. (Supplied: Disney )\n\n\"Visiting old places where you grew up or looking through photo albums are great things to keep people's minds active and connected to the world around them.\"\n\nMr Popovic lived for another decade after his Serbian trip down memory lane and died while still living in his home in 2019 at 89 years of age.\n\nUp until his death, Dr Popovic made sure her father stayed engaged in his community, doing weekly activities like Meals on Wheels and catching up with friends.\n\n\"Loneliness and social isolation drives dementia and they will forget you if you stop visiting,\" she said.\n\n\"People have to be less scared of continuing their relationship with someone with dementia. Just be a little bit more patient because they might repeat stories.\"",

This includes her latest installation: a giant plush rabbit called Bunny Dearest, as part of the Joy exhibition at the Immigration Museum in Melbourne.\n\n\" My work creates that sense of wonder and that sense of joy, which I think people all associate with childhood,\" she adds, \"But it doesn't mean it's childish. \"\n\nOrpin's playful style doesn't stop her from engaging with big topics, like climate change, politics and refugee rights.\n\nThis graphic about compassion by Beci Orpin became so popular online she was commissioned to turn it into a book, called Take Heart, Take Action. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\n\"If you present those issues with a sense of optimism and simplicity then it's really digestible for a whole lot more people, and potentially more people will pay attention to it as well,\" she says.\n\nThree decades into a successful career, Orpin says she can still get frustrated about \"the perception\" of what she does.\n\n\"There's a lot of things I could say about the patriarchy and women artists in general not being taken seriously, especially those who base work in craft,\" she says.\n\nBut although she's struggled at times to figure out where her work fits, she now says that's part of the fun of it.\n\n\"Now I say I sit between the cracks, and that's exactly where I want to sit.\"\n\nChildlike or childish?\n\nCeramic artist Glenn Barkley knows the feeling of being misunderstood and miscategorised all too well.\n\n\"Someone once wrote a review of my work and some other artists who are my peers and they said that our work is childish,\" the artist based on Gadigal land in Sydney tells Namila Benson on ABC iview's The Art Of.\n\n\"I don't think it's childish, I think it's childlike, and they're two completely different things. I think to be childlike is admirable.\"\n\nReplete with pastel colours and hand-made shapes, Barkley constructs intricate and surprising ceramics, covering everything from vases to denim outfits.\n\nGlenn Barkley's intricate, colourful ceramics are assembled by hand. (Supplied by the artist and Sullivan+Strumpf: Photos by Aaron Anderson and Mark Pokorny)\n\nA writer and curator, his passion for ceramics started when he attended a casual pottery workshop.\n\n\"From the moment I touched the material I thought, 'oh, I think I've wasted my life. I should have been doing this 20 years ago'!\"\n\nBarkley's work may be bright and colourful, but it doesn't shy away from more adult topics. His work Stuff White People Like is all about our cultural obsession with conspiracy theories, and features busts of Harold Holt and JFK.\n\n\"I do like big political ideas and cultural ideas,\" Barkley says, \"but sort of looking at them the way a child might.\"\n\nGetting into the gross stuff\n\nThe inner child isn't only drawn to bright colours and simple patterns \u2014 something the Snuff Puppets seize upon.\n\nStream The Art Of... on ABC iview Hosted by Namila Benson, the ABC's bold and vibrant arts and culture show The Art Of\u2026 returns for another season, taking you into the studios, brains and hearts of some of Australia's most exciting creators.\n\nBased out of Naarm/Melbourne, this group of artists create riotous public shows with giant puppets, harnessing the fascination people of all ages have with things that are gross, silly, over-the-top.\n\nStanding at about 10-feet high, the puppets represent everything from enormous babies to seagulls to \"the full range of genitals\".\n\nChief executive and co-artistic director Andy Freer says the sheer scale of the puppets takes adult audience members back to childhood.\n\n\"You have an adult human, about five or six foot, but the puppet is like 10 foot, and so the adult becomes the child,\" says Andy Freer. (Supplied: Snuff Puppets)\n\n\"As a child you see these big adult heads coming down at you, and all those emotions and memories come flooding back \u2014 there is fear, but there is also joy and excitement,\" he says on The Art Of.\n\n\" And I think as we grow older, we do lose this sense of excitement and we get stressed about very boring things. \"\n\nFreer says they like playing with \"very taboo subjects\", and puppets help them push those limits.\n\n\"You can do things with puppets that you really can't do with any other human actor: you can chop their heads off, you can disembowel them, they can give birth.\"\n\nOne of their notorious skits, performed at festivals all around the world, is a comment on the meat industry.\n\nIt starts off with a herd of puppet cows creating a ruckus among a crowd, which always gets a lot of chuckles. But then a man dressed as a butcher arrives to round them up, and the performance turns into a cacophony of blood, excrement (both fake, of course) and general pandemonium.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"It just gets worse and worse and worse, and people are horrified,\" Freer says with a chuckle.\n\n\"But they've been laughing, and horrified at the same time, so they're reverting to this very immediate, childlike response.\"\n\nThe audience reactions go beyond shrieks and chuckles, too. Freer says they once received a random postcard after one of their shows from someone who had been struggling with depression.\n\nThe person said the \"chaos and the magic and the wildness\" was an invaluable help.\n\n\"It made him realise that life can be a crazy madhouse, and we can all have fun and it's not so serious after all.\"\n\nAccessing your inner child\n\nBeci Orpin says she is well and truly still in touch with her inner child.\n\n\"She's never going away,\" she laughs.\n\n\"It's not even something that I think about, I feel like I learned it from my mum, who is super young at heart.\"\n\nOrpin does admit that her perception of joy has been changing as she gets older, which has influenced her work.\n\n\"The joy of experiencing something for the first time is really hard to get, so as you get older the joy seems to come from small things, like if I get a perfect cup of tea in the morning,\" she says.\n\n\"Or it's really large, unexpected things, and so that's what I was trying to create with Bunny Dearest.\"\n\nShe believes that pushing yourself to have new experiences is key to staying in touch with your inner child.\n\nBeci Orpin's \"ode to the sneezy season\" for the Springtime Art Show at Melbourne's Backwoods Gallery. (Supplied: Beci Orpin)\n\n\"I've run lots of workshops, and the adults often enjoy it more than children, and my theory is it's because adults don't allow themselves the time and the space to actually make something,\" she says.\n\n\"So, when their kids are sitting down and making something they're like 'oh great I can do this too'.\"\n\nGlenn Barkley says making art can definitely connect you with your inner child, but that's not the final step.\n\n\"I also think you need to get your inner child to take you to your inner adult, and those two people need to meet each other.\"\n\nWatch the new season of The Art of... free on ABC TV and ABC iview.",

    "text": "For the first time in decades, the Coalition has lost its perceived advantage on economic management, according to a leading academic study released today.\n\nThe results of the Australian Election Study (AES) are a snapshot of the opposition's struggle to win over voters in this year's federal election campaign, suggesting the Liberal Party has lost its grip on one of its longest-held strengths.\n\nIt suggests several short- and long-term problems for the opposition to overcome, with voters preferring Labor's offering on economic management, taxation, housing affordability, and the cost of living.\n\nThe research also found Peter Dutton was the least popular major party leader the AES had ever polled, dating back to the study's beginning four decades ago in 1987.\n\nThe post-election survey of voters' attitudes and behaviour is conducted by the Australian National University (ANU) and Griffith University after every federal election and asks voters for their views on party policies and attitudes to democracy.\n\n\"The Liberals have really ceded the area of economic management to Labor,\" ANU politics professor Ian McAllister said.\n\n\"What it suggests is that it's going to be very difficult for the Liberals to get an advantage back in that area.\n\n\"You really have to build up an area as your policy strength, and once you lose that, it's very difficult to get back.\"\n\nAs recently as 2019, the Coalition held a 26-percentage-point lead over Labor on management of the economy, but that lead slid in 2022 and again in 2025.\n\nNow, the Coalition trails by four percentage points.\n\n\"By and large, people are looking for a party that really isn't going to do any short-term harm to them in terms of economic policy, and at the moment that's the Labor government,\" Professor McAllister said.\n\nThe study has only asked voters about economic management since 2010, but has tracked voter preferences on taxation policy since 1990.\n\nThe Coalition has also traditionally been preferred by voters in that policy area, with the 2025 election the first where Labor's tax policy was preferred.\n\nThe detailed survey was conducted by the ANU and Griffith University after the May 2025 election, with 2,070 respondents recruited from randomly selected addresses across the nation, as well as from participants in previous waves of the study.\n\nWhen asked about the state of the economy, 42 per cent of Australians thought it would be worse in a year's time than it was today, with just 24 per cent thinking it would be in better shape.\n\nWhile voters were generally pessimistic, they were less pessimistic than in the wake of the 2022 election, when 53 per cent of Australians thought the economy would worsen.\n\nAll up, voters preferred Labor's policies in nine of the 10 policy areas surveyed in 2025, with health, education and climate change among the government's strongest areas.\n\nThe only policy area in which Labor trailed the Coalition was national security.\n\nThe Coalition has acknowledged its need to improve its economic credentials since the election, when it campaigned on a promise to repeal tax cuts that Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced in March's federal budget.\n\nThe opposition has sought to frame its new climate emissions and energy policy around power prices and the cost of living, and Shadow Treasurer Ted O'Brien will today outline his party's approach to the budget in an address at the National Press Club.\n\nDutton least popular leader on record\n\nUnsurprisingly, the AES found Anthony Albanese was also the preferred major party leader over Mr Dutton.\n\nIn fact, Mr Dutton recorded the lowest levels of popularity of any major party leader since the study began in 1987.\n\n\"People didn't see him as a leader, he wasn't regarded as a strong leader, and they also saw him as lacking inspiration,\" Professor McAllister said.\n\n\"Certainly, that was a major factor in the lack of success for the Liberals in the election.\"\n\nWhile voters are more likely to say that policy issues are the single biggest influence on their vote, the researchers have found that leadership does matter, and crucially, that swing voters are more likely to have their vote influenced by the party leaders.\n\nThe leader with the second-lowest popularity in the study's history is Scott Morrison in 2022, with Bill Shorten in 2019 coming fourth last in the ranking.\n\nThe most popular leaders in the history of the study were Kevin Rudd in 2007, Bob Hawke in 1987, Kim Beazley in 1998, and John Howard in 1996.\n\nThe findings show a pattern of steadily decreasing popularity of political leaders in general, although the research does not explain the cause.\n\n\"If you draw trend lines \u2026 you'll find that there's quite a significant decrease over the years,\" Professor McAllister said.\n\nWhile the causes of the trend are less clear, it suggests the electoral challenges ahead may not lie solely with the Liberals.\n\n\"While [Labor] obviously won the election and got a historically large number of seats \u2026 their vote has been eroded as well if you look at the first preference vote,\" he said.\n\n\"They aren't suffering as much as the Liberals, but there's potential long-term existential threats to the Labor vote as well.\"\n\nAlready-released findings from the 2025 survey found that millennial voters had bucked the trend of previous generations, who have trended rightward as they have aged. The researchers found that the Coalition picked up just 21 per cent support from that age group in May's election.\n\nMillennials and Gen Z voters shift away from Coalition in 2025 As Liberals prepare to fly to Canberra to hash out their net zero stance, results from the Australian Election Study suggest those under 45 have continued to drift away from them.\n\nThe study also found 25 per of voters said they did not feel close to any political party, a record high, suggesting Australians were increasingly detaching from parties.\n\nThe \"non-partisans\" for the first time on record exceeded the number of Liberal partisans, which fell to 24 per cent.\n\nTrust in government and satisfaction with democracy remained relatively stable since the last election, but the share of Australians who said they would still vote if it were voluntary slipped to 74 per cent, the lowest figure on record.\n\nThe share of voters who support compulsory voting slipped slightly, but remained high at 67 per cent.",

(ABC News: Michael Donnelly)\n\nDuring debate in parliament on Tuesday, Ms Finocchiaro said the public's trust in the ICAC had been eroded and therefore the IEC was needed.\n\n\"Coming into government, we knew we had to restore community confidence in this incredibly important institution,\" she said.\n\n\"Our greatest concern from day one has been what will it take to restore people's trust in this integrity function.\n\n\"We have to deal with that, hence a structural reform.\"\n\nMs Finocchiaro said the IEC would likely become operational within the first half of 2026.\n\nLia Finocchiaro introduced the bill in October.

(ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Centre for Public Integrity said the IEC's establishment would \"not solve the NT's integrity crisis\".\n\n\"Instead, by merging the ombudsman, anti-corruption commission, and health complaints commission into a 'super-commission', they risk making it worse,'\" it said in a statement.\n\n\" The NT government should withdraw this bill and reform their integrity system on the basis of a comprehensive and open inquiry. \"\n\nTransparency International Australia chief executive Clancy Moore said combining the four agencies together created \"obvious risks around conflict of interests and political interference\".\n\n\"The Finocchiaro government must put the bill under the microscope of a parliamentary inquiry and include important guardrails to enshrine the agency's independence, deal with conflict of interests and ensure appointments are based on merit with transparent selection criteria,\" he said.\n\nClancy Moore is calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the bill. (Four Corners: Craig Hansen)\n\nThe bill's explanatory statement says there is \"a clear mechanism for managing actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that may arise when the commissioner performs multiple statutory functions under any of the integrity acts\".\n\nDuring parliamentary debate, Opposition Leader Selena Uibo criticised the bill for lacking provisions for whistleblower protections.\n\nShe also said the reforms should have provided the ICAC an opportunity to \"reset\" and instead the new model would cause another \"period of upheaval\".",

    "text": "James Lew also distracts us with some lollies in the set and costumes design, although the karaoke performances that punctuate the show \u2013 as light relief! \u2013 are a sin against music. Composer and sound designer Guy Webster not only assails our ears with excruciating songs (albeit in keeping with the idiom) sung badly, but backs up the comic-book action with comic-book sound effects, consisting of more explosions of white noise than is fair on the ears. By the time the morals about mother-daughter relationships and having the courage to break one\u2019s own rules engulfed us, I just wanted to be somewhere else. Vying for the silliest play I\u2019ve seen, this made a director, playwright and actors who are capable of good work look fourth rate. MUSIC\n\nFREEDMAN JAZZ\n\nThe Neilson, November 22\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Twenty-four years ago, pianist Andrea Keller won the inaugural Freedman Jazz Fellowship, and now she was one of a trio of judges announcing saxophonist/composer Sam Gill had won this year\u2019s $30,000 fellowship. Gill will pursue compositional studies, collaboration and recording in New York over the next two years.\n\nWhile the windfall can be life-changing, the evening again felt more of a concert than a competition, with the four finalists performing in one of Sydney\u2019s best venues, with musicians of their choice. It was a testament to the diversity and creativity of Australian jazz that all four sounded like no one else in the music\u2019s history. Gill performed three of his compositions with an iteration of his band Coursed Waters, featuring pianist Novak Manojlovic, electric bassist Christopher Hale and drummer James McLean. Instantly we were assailed by the piquancy of Gill\u2019s soprano saxophone sound and the intriguing outside-of-the-box nature of his sophisticated compositions, with their rhythmic switchbacks and radically changing vistas. On Double Down, he turned to his more usual alto saxophone for a piece that could have been the love child of a menage a trois between Anthony Braxton, Frank Zappa and Nino Rota. It allowed the players maximum creative scope, including a Manojlovic solo that swelled and ebbed with the rhythm section to create an extraordinary sense of the music arriving in waves rather than metered time. After a glorious solo from Hale\u2019s six-string bass, the band converged on a sudden starburst of energy that one felt as a physical jolt. But then trumpeter Niran Dasika would have been a worthy winner, too, initially elevating us to the heavens with celestial solo trumpet \u2013 although any angels involved were of the fallen variety, with digital looping, circular breathing and vocal growls used to supernatural effect. When joined by guitarist Lawrence Folvig and drummer Kyrie Anderson, the impact was nothing short of visionary. The guitar hummed and sang like some natural phenomenon, while Anderson was endlessly inventive both texturally and rhythmically, and the trumpet cried out its songs of quiet desperation. In its conceptual scope, this was not a trio, but a three-piece orchestra.\n\nPianist Wilbur Whitta\u2019s trio with bassist Cameron Undy and Alexander Inman-Hislop was utterly engrossing in its sheer playfulness and its ability to make jazz minus the cliches. Again, the compositions were notable for their originality and internal contrasts, with Whitta\u2019s playing effortlessly blending blitheness and conviction. If Perth singer Holli Scott didn\u2019t quite rise to the heights of the other three, she was engaging on her own terms, proving an imaginative lyricist, composer and singer, whose music drifted and swooned like a morning-after reverie. Her songs were performed with trumpeter Jessica Carlton and guitarist Dom Barrett, who ensured that dreaminess remained the prevailing aesthetic, even if the trio was reportedly compromised by sound issues. THEATRE\n\nCowbois\n\nThe Seymour Centre, November 22\n\nUntil December 13\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nThis is a noble-hearted, gun-twirling yet dismayingly middling Australian premiere of Charlie Josephine\u2019s 2023 queer western comic fairytale that rides into Sydney town. Making too much of its saddle of progressive morality, this Siren Theatre production of Cowbois stints the energising camp and soaring spirit needed to vindicate its overlong runtime, going down like slow service on watery whisky.\n\nFor all of director Kate Gaul\u2019s good intentions, it only occasionally comes into itself as a radical, celebratory, liberated reimagining of a genre that traditionally loves a binary. Emily Cascarino, Faith Chaza, Branden Christine, Rory Spinks, Jules Billington, Jane Phegan and Amie McKenna. Credit: Alex Vaughan The play is set, naturally, in a small-town saloon. Unnaturally \u2013 some could say \u201cqueerly\u201d (an overused joke) \u2013 there are almost no menfolk here. Aside from the liquor-shaky sheriff and a precocious boy (referred to as \u201ckid\u201d), the husbands all up and left to join the gold rush a year ago, valiantly promising their wives they\u2019d return with a fortune. Another unnatural thing: the town was built to be an exceptional forward-thinking haven, its two founding principles \u201cno guns, no politics\u201d. However, neither of these are upheld. And when fugitive outlaw Jack Cannon swaggers into town, a new kind of man wanted for murder and wanted in a second, sacrilegiously biblical way, its petticoated inhabitants are left weak-kneed, round-eyed and fundamentally shook. New lawless awakenings are about to happen \u2013 and not even the returning wave of toxic masculinity that crashes down when the boys get back can reinstate the old oppressive \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nJules Billington is our gunslinger in red, infusing as much tender kindness as cocksure masc into the trans baddie. There\u2019s not a whole lot of substance behind the performativity of their character, though, and Jack\u2019s romance with married Miss Lillian (Emily Cascarino) seems to gallop on subversive lust alone (do they have one intimate exchange before professing love to one another?). An impossible event between them confirms the British playwright\u2019s story to be a wistful, better-world fantasy. A live band in the rafters provides subtle atmospherics, comic sound effects and backing for a few song and dance numbers. The actors weren\u2019t cast to excel in this form of entertainment, with a lack of talent and gusto in throat and on hoof making you wonder why what\u2019s billed as \u201cfeel good\u201d so often feels bad. Brockman\u2019s dramatic lighting and Emelia Simcox\u2019s set, featuring clamshell footlights and enormous yellow drapes with purple tassels, battles the underwhelm with immersive aesthetics. One\u2019s heart can\u2019t help but clench in gender-affirming plot moments, too, particularly those involving vulnerable transformation. The sweetest is when \u201cMiss Lucy\u201d, inspired by Jack, shucks off her long skirts to become Lou (Faith Chaza), brave and beaming in jeans and necktie. Sheriff (Matthew Abotomey) also gets a cheer for self-expression of repressed femininity with silk. Clay Crighton (previously on piano and violin, who also contributed original music and lyrics) is a second-act show-stealer as Charley Parkhurst, a hilarious drag caricature of a rival outlaw. His entrance interrupts a long and scattered argument between the townsfolk about new and old values. The most conservative voice is then conveniently shot by dainty hand, and his death promptly passed over by a hammy, action-packed shoot-out. Lord knows the messages of Cowbois are important in a backsliding world. But this desperado could do with more fire in the belly, their steed a swift kick with sharp spurs.\n\nMUSIC\n\nBach Mass in B minor\n\nSydney Chamber Choir\n\nCity Recital Hall, November 22\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd With his genius for contrapuntal combinations carrying deep musical and symbolic significance, Bach constructed the great four-part fugue, Donna Nobis Pacem, which concludes the Mass in B minor, so the pleas for peace pile harmoniously on top of one another, each beginning before the previous one has ceased and overreaching it (a \u201cstretto\u201d in musical terms) to create a sonic image of collective yearning. The swelling sonority and translucent texture of the Sydney Chamber Choir and the Muffat Collective orchestra under Sam Allchurch in this number encapsulated all the virtues of the performance that it brought to such a glowing close: clarity, balance, judicious tempi and an absence of unwanted accent or distortion. Conductor Sam Allchurch. Credit: Robert Catto\n\nThe striking opening chords that begin the Mass were sung with an unforced, open sound, allowing pure vowels and the music\u2019s harmonic richness to convey the necessary emphasis. The ensuing expansive five-part Kyrie fugue flowed with a deeply embedded, unhurried pulse. For the Christe, soprano Sara Macliver and alto Sally-Anne Russell created a nicely edged duet sound and their pealing imitation in the second theme was like the playful eddies of running water. For the second Kyrie, the choir returned with a tone of measured seriousness. The choruses of the Gloria and the addition of a brilliant battery of three trumpets require, of course, more animation, but Allchurch\u2019s broad metric direction ensured the music was emblematic of joy rather than over-excitement. Concertmaster Matthew Greco led with light precision, aptly demonstrated in the nimbleness of his and Macliver\u2019s ornamentation in Laudamus te. Illustrating the two-in-one theme implicit in the text of the Domine Deus section, flute players Melissa Farrow and Mikaela Oberg wove threads of silvery filigree against Macliver and tenor Andrew Goodwin, the latter singing with smoothly tanned finish and blooming projection. Russell sang the Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris aria with full sound and rich colour, memorably bringing the same qualities to the darker depths of the penultimate Agnus Dei just before the final chorus. Bass David Greco enlivened the Quoniam and Et in Spiritum Sanctum arias with pointed, elastic articulation that accentuated the natural rhythmic emphasis of the complex melodic line.\n\nWhile the orchestra retuned after the Credo, Allchurch regrouped the chorus to facilitate the double-choir format Bach uses for the Osanna. The regrouping also highlighted the broad antiphonal strokes of the Sanctus, which swayed majestically like great tolling bells and gave the music of the Donna nobis pacem (which had been heard earlier in the Gratias agimus fugue with the former grouping) a more focused, brilliant finish. When performed as well as it was here, Bach\u2019s Mass inevitably creates a sense of awe and wonder at the extent of human imagination and craft. What better way for Sydney Chamber Choir to end its 50th anniversary season. MUSIC\n\nSam Fender\n\nShowring, Entertainment Quarter, November 21\n\nReviewed by ROD YATES\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 In 2019, British singer-songwriter Sam Fender played his debut Sydney show at the 500-capacity Oxford Art Factory.\n\nFast-forward six years \u2013 during which he\u2019s amassed three UK No.1 albums, a Mercury Music Prize for this year\u2019s People Watching LP and, in June, a sold-out show at the 80,000 capacity London Stadium \u2013 and his star has risen significantly. Among the 15,000 people flowing through the gates of the Showring, the constant stream of Newcastle United shirts suggests his expat appeal remains strong. However, when the North Shields-born artist asks how many in the crowd are British and how many are Australians, the loudest cheer comes from the locals, affirmation that his songs of everyday life and blue-collar tribulation have resonance beyond his home country. Sam Fender\u2019s star has risen significantly. Credit: Georgia Griffiths On this night, those songs sound majestic.\n\nThat Fender opens his biggest-ever Sydney show not with a mainstream hit but the deep cut Angel in Lothian suggests this is a man not tied to the staid old traditions of arena rock but one who has faith in his material and his band to make it a convincing opener. His backing group has swelled to a seven-piece over the years, a younger, northern English answer to Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band, and they look like they\u2019re having the collective time of their life. That they can pull off the howling noise-punk rock of Howdon Aldi Death Queue \u2013 introduced by Fender as a \u201cstupid song\u201d, and arguably the only set-list misstep of the evening \u2013 and follow it with a track as nuanced and elegant as Spit of You is a byproduct not only of the hundreds of shows they\u2019ve played together but their history as friends stretching back to their teenage years. The real stars, though, are the songs themselves. Anthems such as Seventeen Going Under, People Watching and triumphant closer Hypersonic Missiles blend wildly melodic hooks with Fender\u2019s lyrical talent for making his deeply personal experiences resonate with the masses. He begins The Dying Light \u2013 a song that addresses suicide and those \u201cwho didn\u2019t make the night\u201d \u2013 solo on piano before shepherding it to a triumphant, hopeful, full-band climax. The Borders delivers an additional element of joy when a fan is invited onstage to play guitar; recent single Talk to You (the recorded version of which features Elton John) sits as comfortably in the set as older songs such as Will We Talk?",

Abacus Kitchen and Bar, where we sit at an airy corner table, is her local \u2013 a place she drops into with her children when they visit Prahran Market. Katie Allen. Credit: Simon Schluter Before we order, Allen continues to talk me through her diagnosis. While the public only learnt of her cancer after election day in May, she had kept it a secret for 18 months, a decision that left her feeling like she was fighting it alone. Now she speaks about it without hesitation, which she says can be too much for some. It\u2019s as if she is finally exhaling after holding her breath for far too long.\n\nReturning to November 2023 \u2013 the morning after Jemima noticed her yellowing eyes \u2013 Allen found the second sign she had been dreading: white stool. She didn\u2019t try and explain it, she didn\u2019t try and take away the pain because you can\u2019t. Katie Allen Now in Point Lonsdale, she and her husband Malcolm had planned a quiet Melbourne Cup weekend. From there, they immediately drove to Geelong Hospital for a scan. Within an hour, a doctor walked in, sat down and told her simply: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a one-centimetre lesion in your pancreas.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t try and explain it, she didn\u2019t try and take away the pain because you can\u2019t,\u201d Allen says. \u201cShe knew that I knew what that meant.\u201d It was cholangiocarcinoma \u2013 a cancer of the bile ducts that is rare, aggressive and notoriously hard to treat.\n\nAs a doctor, Allen had delivered news like this to parents before. Now she was on the other side. \u201cI wept and she waited.\u201d Allen recognised instantly the dissociation she had seen so often. \u201cThe shutters come down \u2026 you have to give them the bare bones and then say nothing else. I knew that was happening with me.\u201d Within days, she was in surgery. Her tumour was removed, but the risk of recurrence was high \u2013 almost inevitable. She and Malcolm discussed stopping work, selling the house, travelling.\n\n\u201cBut it is just not us,\u201d she said. They agreed instead to carry on. She told fewer than a dozen people: her four children \u2013 Monty, 29; Jemima, 26; Arabella, 24; and Archie, 22 \u2013 and a handful of close family. You go out for dinner, and you have the extra, or you order the champagne, and you get the French, you just say \u2019why the f--- not. Katie Allen With the preselection for Higgins days away, Allen even kept the truth from her staff, claiming she\u2019d had her gall bladder removed. She refused to trigger a sympathy vote. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be defined by the C-word,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to vote for me, or not, because I had cancer.\u201d\n\nOnly after recounting the diagnosis do we turn to lunch. Allen orders the prawn and blue swimmer crab cake with confit kipfler, pickled watermelon radish and squid ink; I choose the Mooloolaba grilled swordfish with reef coconut sauce, potatoes and pangrattato. We share a plate of broccolini. Allen is trying to put on weight. She is noticeably lighter, but she remains bright, animated and determinedly stylish, pausing to reapply her trademark pink lipstick before a photo. Loading As her colleagues in Canberra would attest, Allen has always been forthright, but now she speaks with the certainty of someone who knows exactly how precious time is: \u201cMalcolm said a couple of weeks ago, \u2018this is a bitch of a disease but gosh it has brought some beautiful moments\u2019.\u201d In the two years since she was diagnosed, there is a new rule in the Allen household: you always order the good stuff.\n\n\u201cYou go out for dinner, and you have the extra, or you order the champagne, and you get the French, you just say \u2018why the f--- not\u2019,\u201d she grins. But the extra bottles of Dom aren\u2019t for Allen. She stopped drinking 12 years ago \u2013 ironically, to reduce her cancer risk. At Abacus, we indulge in tall glasses of homemade lemonade. If her illness has taken much from her, it has also drawn her already tight-knit family closer together. In 2024, all four of her children were living or studying in Britain. But when December came, they all flew home to spend time with their mum \u2013 the cancer still a secret. Subtle excuses kept the extended clan away, allowing a two-week cocoon at home. \u2018The kids are amazing, they are my greatest story \u2026 They are very loving children.\u2019 Katie Allen \u201cI was crying the whole time,\u201d Allen tells me through floods of tears. \u201cIt was the best two weeks of my life ... It was so gorgeous.\u201d\n\nHer children created a treasure hunt for her Christmas present, hiding gifts in the places she is at her happiest, like a book for the hammock in the garden. \u201cThe kids are amazing, they are my greatest story \u2026 They are very loving children.\u201d This month she became a grandmother for the first time, a milestone that brings both joy and a fierce determination to keep going. Allen\u2019s own childhood was similarly close. Born in 1966, she grew up in Albury, where her father Bill was a much-loved local physician. She tagged along on his ward rounds at seven, the moment medicine imprinted itself. \u201cHe loved what he did, he had a beautiful bedside manner.\u201d\n\nAfter boarding school at Melbourne Girls Grammar \u2013 where her grandmother, mother and daughters were also educated \u2013 she briefly flirted with journalism, making it to the final six for a cadetship at a Melbourne newspaper. Monash medicine won out. He kissed me and we have never looked back. We have been together ever since. I have never looked at another man. Katie Allen Two decades before that fateful Cup weekend when she was diagnosed with cancer, Allen met her husband trackside at Flemington on Cup weekend. It was 1988, Empire Rose won the two-mile race, but Allen insists she \u201csnagged\u201d the best prize \u2013 an Englishman called Malcolm. \u201cHe kissed me and we have never looked back. We have been together ever since. I have never looked at another man. Never thought about another man. He is my rock.\u201d Back in that Geelong hospital room, it was Malcolm \u2013 a management consultant \u2013 who refused to let the diagnosis upend their lives. Through floods of tears, Allen recalls turning to her husband, who was already encouraging her not to give up on her dream of returning to Canberra.\n\n\u201cOh Malcolm, it\u2019s over,\u201d she told him. Loading While she absorbed the emotional shock, he shifted instantly into what she calls management mode \u2013 encouraging her to run for Higgins, even as she recovered from surgery. \u201cI was doing it to keep him happy,\u201d she admits. \u201cHe just wants to keep kicking the cancer can down the road.\u201d Allen went on to win preselection for Higgins. Five months later, the seat would be abolished in a redistribution, forcing her into a bruising contest for neighbouring Chisholm. In September 2024, she defeated the preselected candidate, Theo Zographos, to secure the party\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cNow and then, if someone would do something really mean, I would think \u2018If only you knew I had cancer\u2019,\u201d she jokes. Katie Allen outside a polling booth on election day in May 2022. Credit: Scott McNaughton By early 2025, with the federal election approaching, her symptoms crept back. Mild abdominal pain at first, then more unmistakable signs. She knew she should see a doctor, but put it off \u2013 a delay she now recognises as denial. A conga line of Liberal colleagues visited Chisholm to help her campaign. She never once revealed her private health battle. She knows the ethics of running while harbouring a cancer diagnosis will always prompt debate \u2013 voters deserve transparency and candidates owe them the full picture.\n\nAllen grappled with the possibility of winning, relapsing, and triggering a by-election, but her family pushed her to live fully, not withdraw. \u201cMy family all said it\u2019s better I get in there and do it.\u201d A tropical cyclone pushed the election to May, stretching out the campaign as her health deteriorated. Some nights she plunged into the pool three times to soothe the pain. Katie Allen in 2022. Credit: Simon Schluter \u201cI rang my doctor and said \u2018I am deteriorating\u2019 and she knew what that meant.\u201d\n\nStill, she did not want her illness to influence the result. Loading On May 3, she lost Chisholm. The following Monday, she was in hospital for tests and immediately started chemotherapy. The cancer had spread. After the relapse, she said her prognosis \u201cdropped significantly\u201d, shifting her into what oncologists call a different \u201cprognostic environment\u201d. She doesn\u2019t like the term \u201cterminal\u201d but acknowledges it is incurable. Still, she holds tight to what she calls \u201cdeluded hope\u201d \u2013 the stories of rare patients who defy the averages.\n\n\u201cThere are some people who are the outliers who last a year or two, and you want to be the outlier. \u201cI know it is deluded hope, but what else have you got.\u201d A new clinical trial \u2013 one she nearly missed \u2013 has given her new hope. Before that, she had just wanted to make it to Christmas. \u201cIf you are on a treatment with no side effects, that is a good quality of life.\u201d Allen is approaching life with vulnerability and pragmatism, largely free of regrets \u2013 except for Canberra, where she wishes she had done more to champion the party\u2019s moderate faction.\n\n\u201cI went in to change the Liberal Party from the inside \u2026 but I completely and utterly failed. I did my best, but I didn\u2019t make much difference.\u201d Katie Allen with John Howard in 2022. Credit: Eddie Jim During her time in Canberra, she crossed the floor on the religious discrimination bill to vote on amendments that would prohibit vilification of and discrimination against children based on sexuality and gender identity, protecting all LGBTIQ+ students. She also joined colleagues pushing for the Murugappan family to be returned to Biloela. And she was part of the internal push to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. She jokes that she should have been \u201cthe Pauline Hanson of the moderates\u201d, but said she mostly remained quiet when she should have spoken up.\n\nDespite the recent turmoil in the state and federal Liberal parties, Allen hasn\u2019t given up. She sees promise in younger women such as Jess Wilson and Amelia Hamer, whose rise she has quietly supported \u2013 even hosting events for Hamer as her health wobbled. Loading Her medical background means she does not romanticise what lies ahead. She supports Victoria\u2019s voluntary assisted dying laws for others but doesn\u2019t wish to use them saying she has great faith in the health system. When her time does come \u2013 a date she hopes has been pushed further back thanks to her new trial \u2013 she hopes to spend her final days at home. But she is not grieving her life.",

    "text": "Prior criticism around the tour\u2019s lack of visuals, structure and outfits are technically warranted \u2013 the stage remains unchanged throughout and Doja wears just one costume. But such simplicity keeps all eyes on the so-called queen of rap-pop, whose exaggerated facial expressions offer all the theatrics needed. And when you aren\u2019t looking at Doja, you\u2019re watching her tiger-striped band, many of whom do the robot or roll around on the floor during instrumental interludes. Loading For someone who\u2019s known for sending the occasional barb to fans online (remember when she told us to \u201cget a job\u201d?), there sure is a lot of love in the room. The crowd \u2013 many of whom are dressed in \u201980s workout gear and inflatable cow costumes \u2013 carry Doja through each track, particularly Take Me Dancing and Boss Bitch, singing so loudly it practically drowns out the backing tracks. This clearly tickles Doja, who smiles ear-to-ear each time she holds the mic out. Her commitment to the fans shines brightest when she stops the show to ask the crowd to help get a fan who has fainted to safety. It may not be her strongest gig, but you know you have a star on your hands when a singer who is losing their voice can still make a packed crowd purr.\n\nReviewed by Nell Geraets\n\nMUSIC\n\nDaniel M\u00fcller-Schott with Konstantin Shamray \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre, November 25 German cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott has returned to Melbourne, filling Elisabeth Murdoch Hall with the glorious resonance and many-splendoured lyricism of his 1727 \u201cEx Shapiro\u201d Matteo Goffriller cello. Cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott Noting his instrument is almost exactly contemporaneous with Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No. 3 in C major, BWV 1009, M\u00fcller-Schott brought an expansive, larger-than-life feeling to this classic. Like the rest of the suite, the Prelude was flexible yet rhythmic, powered by artistic and technical assurance. Other movements were beautifully characterised, with especially telling contrasts between the sprightly Courante and the intense yet subtly coloured Sarabande, while the well-known Bour\u00e9e and the rustic Gigue were buoyed by joyous rhythmic energy.\n\nTogether with Russian-born, Australian-based pianist Konstantin Shamray, M\u00fcller-Schott offered great insights into Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Sonata in D minor, Op. 40. Once again proving himself to be an extraordinary colourist, M\u00fcller-Schott gave the opening two themes a life of their own, with exchanges between instruments deftly handled. Loading At the centre of the work, the third-movement Largo became a soul-searing expression of heartache. This vividly etched lament was surrounded by remarkable vigour, both in the second-movement Allegro and in the impish finale. Throughout, the artists harnessed Shostakovich\u2019s formidable array of technical demands to memorable musical ends. From the outset, Brahms\u2019 Cello Sonata No. 2 in F major, Op. 99 overflowed with grandeur and ardent passion. Thanks to the superb instrument, the pizzicato in the Adagio had an unusual depth, while the middle section of the Allegro passionato was yet another instance of the cello\u2019s voice taking on an almost-human quality. The cheerful, hope-giving finale set the seal on arguably one of the best concerts of the year. How wonderful to see M\u00fcller-Schott\u2019s generous, open personality and poetic musicianship garner him quite a following of young fans, teeming in the audience and listening with rapt attention.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nCABARET\n\nMeow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMalthouse Theatre, until December 6 The original Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s tale involves a girl enamoured with a pair of red shoes. As punishment for her vanity, the shoes are cursed, and she\u2019s forced to dance in them forever. Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes is a retelling of the Hans Christian Anderson classic. Credit: Brett Boardman Even when her feet are amputated, the shoes still dance tauntingly before her. Yes, it\u2019s grim, as a lot of these unvarnished fairytales are wont to be, but this is Meow Meow\u2019s Red Shoes, and she has her own ideas about the classic story. It\u2019s the third iteration in her fairytale series, after The Little Matchstick Girl and The Little Mermaid. The show opens on a comic note with the performer (otherwise known as Melissa Madden Gray) being dragged on stage by her legs. This self-confessed \u201ceternal showgirl\u201d has lost her muse; she\u2019s a marionette slackened with existential angst and more attuned to the sorry, lustreless state of the world.\n\nIndeed, Dann Barber\u2019s set contributes to the post-apocalyptic mood with its mountain of debris and a plastic curtain. Meow Meow climbs up and down this graveyard of rubbish, singing and emoting and resplendent in a black mini dress, bouffant hair and even bigger plumed headgear. The musicians (Mark Jones, Dan Witton and Jethro Woodward) are in distressed tuxedoes, and between them play an astonishing array of instruments including piano, guitar, double bass, drums and tuba. Dann Barber\u2019s set contributes to the post-apocalyptic mood. Credit: Brett Boardman Meow Meow\u2019s energy is unflagging: aside from the actual dancing (sometimes lopsidedly with different footwear), she also hops, crawls and does the splits. She can be vulnerable one moment (hobbling around trying to find her missing red shoe), and brazen the next, in an interactive aside with the audience to \u201credistribute the wealth\u201d. There\u2019s a lot going on in this digressive show with its various sprays against communism, capitalism and world greed in general. It\u2019s a springboard of ideas, but it\u2019s difficult to find the skein of narrative about the titular red shoes in between all the play and hijinks.\n\nMeow Meow does challenge Andersen (Kanen Breen) at one point about the fairytale\u2019s punitive corrective against a girl who simply wanted to dance. Maybe dancing isn\u2019t the problem, but the cure? Maybe we need more art in our lives? The ambiguities are open to interpretation. Could Red Shoes also be a self-reflexive comment about diva narcissism seeking external validation or the peripatetic career path of artists? Kanen Breen and Meow Meow in Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes. Credit: Brett Boardman In the movie of The Wizard of Oz, after a series of (mis)adventures, Dorothy\u2019s ruby shoes took her home; in this story they have the opposite effect: they\u2019re a talisman of the dangers of creative ambition, of the neverending desire to prove oneself, even if that aspiration can take you (like Meow Meow\u2019s career) far away from home. For those hoping or expecting linearity and cohesion, you\u2019d leave bewildered with this rag-tag assortment of song, dance and spectacle but if you\u2019re a fan of cabaret with a twist of the absurd, Meow Meow\u2019s charisma and rich honeyed tones, Breen\u2019s operatic tenor, and the trio of musicians provide theatrical ballast.\n\nReviewed by Thuy On\n\nMUSIC\n\nRyman Healthcare Spring Gala: Joyce DiDonato \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Symphony Orchestra, Hamer Hall, November 21 Making her first major Australasian tour, American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato confirmed her reputation as one of this generation\u2019s most compelling classical singers in a memorably sophisticated account of Berlioz\u2019 song cycle Nuits d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 (Summer Nights) with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under chief conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn. American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato performs with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Credit: Laura Manariti DiDonato took evident delight in revealing the elegant sensuality and profound emotion flowing from this supreme expression of French romanticism. Charting a journey from innocence through loss to new life, the six songs were a perfect vehicle for her vocal versatility. Keenly alive to musical and textual nuance, DiDonato\u2019s voice of liquid gold brought simple delight to Villanelle, exquisitely contrasted by the ruminative ecstasy of The Spectre of the Rose in which the climactic line, \u201cI come from paradise\u201d was superbly seductive. Contemplating isolation and death, On the Lagoons, Absence and At the Cemetery brought out the alluring, expressive qualities of her lower range, before radiant enthusiasm marked her sailing to The Unknown Isle.\n\nA generous performer, DiDonato offered two encores: a steamy Habanera from Bizet\u2019s Carmen and then, making a link between her native Kansas and the Land of Oz, a heartwarming rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Beginning with Rossini\u2019s William Tell overture may seem hackneyed but the initial rapturous cello solo brilliantly delivered by David Berlin offset the all-too-familiar gallop. Jaime Mart\u00edn conducts the Spring Gala. Credit: Laura Manariti After interval came two-thirds of Respighi\u2019s Roman trilogy: The Fountains of Rome and The Pines of Rome. While the latter undeniably ends in a blaze of glory, such unimaginative programming forfeited the opportunity of introducing a large audience to the least heard and arguably the best of the three suites, The Festivals of Rome. That said, the orchestral playing was consistently engaging and the Berlioz especially was sensitively accompanied. However, the night belonged to DiDonato, who hopefully can dazzle Melbourne again soon.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nPixies \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Festival Hall, November 19 Female bass players are to the Pixies as drummers are to Spinal Tap: they\u2019ve had a lot of them. Kim Deal (1987-2012), Kim Shattuck (briefly in 2013), Paz Lenchantin (2014-2023) have all come and gone. Black Francis of Pixies performs onstage at Festival Hall, November 19, 2025. Credit: Richard Clifford Now it\u2019s Emma Richardson\u2019s turn to provide the driving bass and sweet harmonies that are so crucial to the Boston-born band\u2019s loud-quiet-loud dynamic. And she stands tall, literally and figuratively, towering over frontman Black Francis, guitarist Joey Santiago and drummer Dave Lovering when the four embrace and take a well-earned bow at the end of their blistering 32-song two-hour set on Wednesday night. This is the back-to-back album show, in which the band play Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991) track by track, throwing in a handful of faves at the end for good measure. On this tour, they alternate set lists across two-night engagements, with the second set featuring a best-of collection from across their catalogue, plus some songs from their new album, The Night the Zombies Came.\n\nPixies are, and always have been, a no-nonsense noise machine. As they take the stage \u2013 unadorned, apart from a winged P and four spheres that morph from planets to eyes over the course of the show (nods to the respective albums\u2019 cover art) \u2013 Francis takes a sip from a mug and says \u201chello time travellers\u201d before offering some background on the origins of Cecilia Ann, the opening track on Bossanova (a cover of a Surftones song recorded in 1964 but not released until 1988, its origins are in French composer Gabriel Faure\u2019s Sicilienne \u2026 apparently). It\u2019s the fourth time I\u2019ve seen the Pixies live (the first was at their absolute peak in 1989), and before they\u2019ve played a note, Francis has already said a lot more than in the three other shows combined. Pixies are, and always have been, a no-nonsense noise machine. Credit: Richard Clifford He\u2019s in a good mood, and no wonder. The band is tight as, ripping through songs at a rate of knots. \u201cThank you. The songs are kind of short, I know,\u201d he says at one point. And he\u2019s right. Some barely pass the 90-second mark. His voice is different than it was in 1987, when their debut mini-album Come On Pilgrim blasted onto the world. It\u2019s gruffer, scarred by the screams that litter many tracks, but the counterpoint upper register is still intact. It works.\n\nSantiago\u2019s guitar work is as good as ever, searing, surfy, scintillating, and on Velouria, Allison, Is She Weird and Dig For Fire, the band sounds as good as they ever did. The energy kicks up a notch when they trip into the Trompe set, with barely a pause to note the transition. This is a punkier set of songs, fast and furious, and the crowd becomes more energised as the set wears on. Loading The influence of Pixies, who recorded just four studio albums in their first wave of mutilation before breaking up in 1993 (and another five since reforming in 2004), has been well noted, with Nirvana and Weezer among the many to have paid homage. But on this night, with this set list, the backward lineage was apparent too: a cover of Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s Head On, the aforementioned Surftones track (and a general infusion of surf-guitar sounds throughout), and, in the final bracket of non-album tracks, Neil Young\u2019s Winterlong. It was a welcome reminder that although it sometimes felt like they\u2019d arrived from nowhere \u2013 or, maybe, from outer space \u2013 the Pixies were indeed born of this world. They\u2019re strange, jarring, at times unfathomable, but on this form they remain as vital as ever.\n\nReviewed by Karl Quinn\n\nDANCE\n\nBrigid \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, until November 22 The room fills with haze while the dancers lie prone, hiding their faces. It\u2019s an opening scene that recalls those old images of Celtic romance: an orange twilight glow, frothing vapours and ancient figures half-buried in the earth. Brigid is an evocation of the pagan Irish goddess of the same name Credit: Agust\u00edn Far\u00edas Brigid, created by Alice Heyward and Ois\u00edn Monaghan, is an evocation of the pagan Irish goddess of the same name, one of the folk divinities of that legendary age before recorded history \u2013 the imagined time of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. We actually know very little about this daughter of the Dagda. Her story has been partly obscured by the later Saint Brigid of Kildare, the famous abbess and miracle-worker, the so-called Mary of the Gael who turned dirty bathwater into beer.\n\nIn looking back to the older Brigid, Heyward and Monaghan seem to take her obscurity as a cue. This is a work full of uncertainties and strange vacancies amid the rattling, racketing old-style jigging that fills the space. Loading The three performers \u2013 Heyward, Monaghan and Oonagh Slater \u2013 slowly raise themselves. You feel the heaviness of it, the work of dragging something old and earth-loving back into motion. They fall and fall again, landing with real weight. The dancing arrives gradually. At first, they fall into step together: a fleeting suggestion, perhaps, of the goddess\u2019s triple aspect. Then they separate, moving with apparent freedom across the long, windy gap between lights set at either end of the studio. Monaghan\u2019s boots slap the boards like antique flat irons. Or maybe hammers. Is this a vision of Brigid in her role as patroness of blacksmiths? The loud percussive steps follow closely the work of sound designer Gregor Kompar, who also performs live.",

Check-in Not unlike the flux of defecting A-listers and preternaturally beautiful folk who\u2019ve sent Byron\u2019s average attractiveness levels into the stratosphere, The Bower Byron Bay continues to hold its own among the town\u2019s newest crop of glamorous coastal stays. She\u2019s had a fair whack of work over the decades. The former 1970s motel was first reimagined as a luxury hotel in 2017 \u2013 the original designer and co-owner, Taliah Lowry, laced Byron\u2019s beachy essence with a touch of New York grit, inspired by the US city\u2019s industrial-cool Bowery neighbourhood. A recent two-year upgrade has once again restored its sheen and grown its footprint, with new additions including a guest lounge, hotel bar, swish new reception space, an onsite spa treatment centre and four beautiful new suites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe look The new guest lounge \u2026 currently used for functions. The Bower Barn. The Bower\u2019s old-school roadside motel past is easy to spot, thanks to a concrete carpark that dissects the property, but creative firms Studio Plenty and Tanev Muir have added plenty of tropical greenery and flair to the mix. No two accommodations are the same, though they do share a penchant for organic textiles and tones, modern art, dark woods and custom furnishings by Byron artist Alexis Williams. The revamp has also seen all rooms upgraded with king beds, and a beautiful new lounge and bar area that\u2019s currently reserved as a function space. The one-bed Bower Barn and five-bedroom Bower Cottage at the back of the property are among the most striking and sought-after stays \u2013 think charming white weatherboard exteriors, picket gates, pitched ceilings, rustic wooden beams, and luxe touches like a glass-roofed bath (for bathing under the stars) and a private cedar mineral spa. Outside, a striking solar-panel-powered circular heated magnesium pool, hugged by palms and day beds with privacy curtains, is the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe room One of the new luxury Bower Studios. Shades of grey \u2026 the Bower Studio. We\u2019re staying in one of two newly launched Bower Studios. The sultry combination of a giant four-poster bed, distressed mirrors, and sheer black curtains framing a freestanding stone bath feels both luxurious and, erm, 50 Shades? The cabin\u2019s entrance is steps from the car spot, tucked behind a whitewashed wall for extra privacy; inside, a soaring pitched roof and spectrums of charcoal tap into that smouldering New York warehouse vibe. There\u2019s a kitchenette, Nespresso machine, mini-bar stocked with snacks and local favourites, complimentary bath salts and decadent Hunter Amenities. It takes a second to master where to find the various light switches; tech is generally great, with fast Wi-Fi and a smart TV with casting capability. The beautiful rough-hewn wooden side tables and handmade ceramic lamps look neat, but don\u2019t leave much room for a phone or book. The open-plan en-suite is all sorts of ravishing, between the egg-shaped bath overlooking a glass-walled garden and floating vanity. Food + drink\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pool is serviced by a licensed pool bar. There\u2019s no onsite restaurant, though the spiffy pool area is serviced by a licensed pool bar offering a basic menu of Curatif canned cocktails, drinks and bar snacks \u2013 and you can BYO food from local eateries or pre-order a hamper (if you\u2019re after something freshly shaken, you\u2019ll have to venture into town). Next door, The General Store cafe mixes heritage appeal with a sun-kissed aesthetic, and the coffee and brunch dishes don\u2019t miss (the smoked bacon is a revelation). Out + about Pixie Italian dining room. It\u2019s a 15-minute walk to town and 20 minutes to the beaches. Happily, the buzzy Jonson Lane area is only a block away and boasts some of the town\u2019s best restaurants \u2013 tuck into aperitivo and chilli-laced tubes of mezze maniche pasta with pork sausage at Pixie Italian, or soak up the punchy Asian flavours and deep list of lo-fi drops at Bar Heather.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can\u2019t swing a yoga mat without hitting a day spa in these parts, but the Bower\u2019s petite new guest-only spa is well worth securing a booking for, offering treatments with luxe Mukti Organics products; the 90-minute facial has me floating back to my room. The verdict The pool, the bath ... file it all under \u201cridiculously good-looking\u201d and chalk it down to the Byron effect. A worthy base from which to hit the town\u2019s boutiques, beaches, and bars, The Bower\u2019s latest refresh cements it as one of the better luxury options in town.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size This month Australia implements laws to address the toxic aspects of online life, but not so long ago, it was apparently perfectly fine for a good portion of the internet to direct astonishing levels of hatred and vitriol at a young girl from California. People who go viral for reasons beyond their control typically disappear back into the scenery of non-internet life. Rebecca Black never flinched. Black is now touring Australia as part of the Spilt Milk festival, alongside Kendrick Lamar and Doechii. She\u2019s also headlining her own shows, including her largest ever at Melbourne\u2019s Forum Theatre. If you think her presence has something to do with Friday, the song that launched her to fame and became the most viewed YouTube video the year it was released, you\u2019re living in the past. A brief recap is all the Friday affair deserves. When Black was 13 she recorded a novelty pop song and video clip with an LA company that offered ordinary folks just such an experience. Friday was intended to be a throwaway bit of fun to share with friends, but somehow the music video ended up online right at the moment when memes and meanness were becoming inextricable. Until that point, social media had been a largely benign place full of lolcats and rickrolling and pokes. By 2011, however, the tone had started to shift. The default voice was snarkier, the humour had become crueller, and any innocent could find themselves hoisted up for public ridicule. The socials democratised the angry mob, promising a pitchfork and flaming torch for everyone. Black \u2013 at age 22 \u2013 who was just 13 when her pop video went viral for all the wrong reasons. Credit: It\u2019s hard to overstate just how vile the response to Friday became, with strangers posting the most violent and juvenile comments towards a random kid whose home movie had so upset them. From medieval witch trials to the screaming fans of the Fab Four to the Twilight and Tay-Tay stans in recent times, there\u2019s a certain sort who have a screaming fit whenever they see a girl having fun on her own terms. Today it\u2019s Black: 1, Haters: 0. She never quit. This year the 28-year-old played a DJ set at Lollapalooza, one of the largest music festivals on earth. Punters who only remembered her as the Friday girl were floored. The set-list from that gig includes titles familiar from the pop canon \u2013 from Britney\u2019s Toxic to Bjork\u2019s Hyperballad to Addison Rae\u2019s Fame Is a Gun \u2013 but you won\u2019t find the bootleg cuts she spins anywhere on Spotify or Shazam. They\u2019re familiar while also illustrating a deep knowledge of dance culture today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Black DJs, she says, \u201cI\u2019m there to highlight the tracks that I really love and feel attached to, that I find in the depths of SoundCloud or some random part of someone\u2019s discography. I love playing throwback stuff because I want to play the remixes that I wish I could hear in a club, that I know would be played deep in some Barcelona queer underground club.\u201d TAKE 7: THE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO REBECCA BLACK Worst habit? Picking my nails, which I\u2019m doing right now. Greatest fear? Dying. The line that stayed with you? The concept that life hands you exactly what you need when you\u2019re ready for it. You\u2019ll never be handed a situation to get through without the ability to undertake it. Whether or not it is actually true I\u2019m not sure, but it has certainly helped me hold onto hope when I needed it. Biggest regret? Missing moments with family over the years. It takes effort, and I don\u2019t want to have regrets over that. Favourite book? In the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado. It\u2019s an incredible book about toxic queer relationships. The artwork or song you wish was yours? There\u2019s a lot. The new ROSAL\u00cdA album is something only she could do, even having the concept to do it. If you could time travel, where would you choose to go? The future. I want to know what\u2019s up. But I\u2019m afraid of time travel, for sure. That mix of pop appeal and underground edginess is what Black\u2019s own songwriting has evolved into. Her latest album, Salvation, is a banging mix of abrasive hyperpop (think SOPHIE or Charli XCX) and the kind of ambitious songwriting that fell out of favour for the first few decades of this century. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m listening way more to things from the past than I am things that are happening right now. That\u2019s where I learn,\u201d Black says. \u201cIf you go back and listen to some of the big pop stars of the \u201990s, like Madonna, Janet, that was a time where pop was actually really interesting. \u201cListen to some of the instrumentals that were on Velvet Rope, Ray of Light, Erotica. That was a time where I think pop was at its best and was celebrated because it was constantly trying to push itself forward ... I think that was why pop died for a second. It felt like that ethos got lost. Everyone was just trying to make something really digestible.\u201d The teenage Black might have been treated harshly by the internet, but like most people her age, her music tastes were discovered online. \u201cI don\u2019t think the way that my relationship with music developed was much different to a lot of my fans,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really a relationship with the internet, a relationship with artists who were really intrinsic to the internet. I mean, I was a Tumblr kid growing up. My audience were my peers.\u201d That might be why the comments on her videos today speak so starkly of the way our online culture has changed. They\u2019re full of admiration for the artist and passionate about their love of her new work, occasionally punctuated with shocked praise from viewers who didn\u2019t realise this was that Rebecca Black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do think there are pieces of the internet where there is an intention to treat others with kindness,\u201d she says. \u201cI see moments where the internet is trying to police itself in ways.\u201d Offline, too, she\u2019s found her people. The Rebecca Black of 2025 has become something of an icon in queer club spaces, where she finds so much of the most interesting music is happening. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of places outside of the US that are way more advanced in the queer spaces they have, including Australia, Melbourne particularly.\u201d She also does a lot of meet-and-greets as she tours. \u201cI love them because I really love understanding who gets it? Who gets me in this way?\u201d Black is now a DJ and something of a queer icon. Credit: Getty Images for Kohls The lyrics on Salvation sometimes flirt with possible references to Black\u2019s past \u2013 the title track\u2019s chorus declares that \u201cI don\u2019t need you to save me/I already saved myself\u201d \u2013 but the vocals also toy with voice and character to blur personal experience and the playfulness of fiction. \u201cSome of those characters are ways that I can channel the parts of myself that only exist in my head,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s ways that we talk to ourselves or talk about things with ourselves in our heads that I would never articulate, even with a partner. That lives just for me. But the other place it can live is in a song. Those characters are the most deeply personal in a way because I\u2019m disguising them as something that\u2019s a different version of me, but it\u2019s actually probably the truest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "More protein and fresh food, hyper-selective eating and 'mini menus'. With an increasing number of Australians on Ozempic-like weight loss medications, these are some of the ways our future eating habits could be influenced, experts say.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally developed for the management of diabetes, these GLP-1 drugs are now being sold for weight loss due to their appetite suppression capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past five years in Australia, there's been a surge in the uptake of these medications, such as semaglutide \u2014 marketed as Ozempic and Wegovy, and tirzepatide \u2014 sold as Mounjaro.\n\n\n\nHow many Australians are on Ozempic-like medications?\n\nNearly 500,000 Australians \u2014 almost 2 per cent of the adult population \u2014 are using Ozempic-like medications for weight loss or medical reasons, according to a report led by researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), which has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSales of GLP-1 medications have increased almost 10-fold from 57,941 units in May 2020 to 496,875 units in April 2025, according to the UNSW report, which measured the gap between sales to pharmacies and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) dispensings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figures are likely an underestimate because there may be more GLP-1 medicines that weren't examined in the report.\n\n\n\n\"The popularity of these GLP-1 medicines are booming in Australia,\" report lead researcher Michael Falster, from the UNSW School of Population Health, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore people could join the uptake as medication costs drop and they become available in pill form, instead of an injection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFalster said such medicines for obesity are under review for subsidisation on the PBS.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said, if they are subsidised, there would likely be \"huge growth in the number of people who are using the medicines\".\n\n\n\nHow will Ozempic change Australian eating habits?\n\nAppetite suppression and a shift in tastes \u2014 two of the effects of the medications \u2014 are set to have a knock-on effect on the food industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every bite needs to count, and so, you know, people will be looking for those high nutrient options so that quality protein, the fibre element, is very important to support the gut health and some of the side effects,\" professor Rebecca Golley, a professor of Nutrition and Dietetics at Flinders University, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to food and agribusiness bank Rabobank, more people eating less could lead to a rise in demand for dairy, fresh food and \"functional beverages\", with people chasing more \"value per bite\".\n\n\n\n\"It's changing quite sizeably how those consumers are eating, and the amount of people on those products is rising in Australia,\" Stefan Vogel, general manager of the bank's research division, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why is protein so important? Because it's not only fat that one is losing when you're using the drug, but it's also muscle that is reduced.\"\n\n\n\nHow dinners are changing in households\n\nA US study found households with at least one person on the medications reduced spending on products such as chips, sweet baked goods and salad dressings, while yoghurt, fresh produce, meat snacks and nutrition bars grew slightly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose eating habits are likely to affect more than the person on that medication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's often not the person itself that's using the drug, but it's the larger part of the household that shows some change,\" Volger said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The dinners are changing a little bit across the household.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Experts call for 'urgent' scrutiny after weight loss drugs are linked to suicidal thoughts\n\nIt's currently estimated that usage of GLP-1 drugs is already reducing food and beverage consumption by one to two per cent, driven primarily by the United States and with Europe starting to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\nVogel said the food industry is looking at what to do about products that are high in sugar and high in fat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready, companies such as Nestl\u00e9 are responding by introducing a line of high-protein, high-fibre frozen meals, while Danone and Coca-Cola are also trying to capture the \"Ozempic market\" by selling high-protein, low-sugar products.\n\n\n\n\n\nRestaurants in the US are also reportedly selling \"Ozempic menus\" to appeal to people taking the medications, selling bite-size portioned meals.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, with the uptake still relatively low compared to the general population, restaurants in Australia are not following the US trend, Vogel said.\n\n\n\nGolley from Flinders University said many Australians still opt for discretionary and energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, a trend that's been consistent for over three decades. GLP-1 drugs could reverse the trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These drugs will be one of those things that we can add into the mix to finally see a shift to decrease those energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Falster from UNSW said GLP-1 medications are not a \"magic bullet\" for weight loss and the best way to obtain the clinical effects are to use the medicines with other lifestyle interventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a good chance that what people eat is going to change in the future,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I think...we need to make sure that people are working with clinicians and dietitians to make sure that what they are eating is healthy and balanced and appropriate for making sure people maintain muscle and bone while they're in the process of losing fat.\"\n\n\n\n",

I don't save anything, I don't have any savings. The additional money will come from my parents, if something pops up, like my car if there is a flat tyre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Clements works part-time in administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut every dollar she earns reduces her pension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got some money here we can use. Some fake money\u2026 gosh, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if it was real.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving for a home deposit is a thought she\u2019s learned to push away.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the guilt hits hardest when she thinks about providing for her kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I actually try not to think about it because it makes me feel like a huge failure. It\u2019s never been on my radar\u2026 that I couldn\u2019t provide for my kids.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Clements says she grew up in a mid-level wealthy family.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s been renting for the past decade, but in the past few years her rent went from $380 a week to $850 today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the competition is fierce.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s been to several home opens recently \u2014 each she says, with more than 40 people lining up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I went to one home open, I was waiting to ask a question to the real estate agent ... as I was waiting there a lady was already talking to him who said she had just sold her property and had $600,000 in her savings, so she was happy to pay a whole year of rent in advance.. so they are the type of people I am competing with.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Shelter\u2019s latest Rental Affordability Index shows this pressure is happening across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile interest rates have steadied, affordability isn't easing quick enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Engeler, from National Shelter, says the solution has to come from every level of government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are the types of things state governments can do \u2014 and when you back it in with what the Commonwealth can do, both through leadership and schemes like build-to-rent and national rental laws, and other ways the Commonwealth itself can make a difference - that's what we'd like to see.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in many cities, especially Sydney and Perth, that difference can\u2019t come fast enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sydney, the pressure is just as intense.\n\n\n\n\n\nForty-two-year-old Charlotte Karlsson-Jones came to Australia from Sweden at 19 as a student.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than two decades later, she\u2019s a single mother still renting \u2014 and still struggling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For me as a first-generation immigrant\u2026 my parents aren\u2019t in the property market. We don\u2019t have the luxury others in my generation have had. We\u2019re already far behind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking part-time, she earns $2,000 a fortnight.\n\n\n\n\n\n$1,200 of that goes straight to rent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Older women have for a very long time sort of been the most high risk of ending up as homeless, or in social housing, so I think that's not something we address by housing for older women. I think we address it way earlier in a woman's life in terms of their opportunites to go to work and support themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just families feeling the strain.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusinesses are struggling to attract staff who simply can\u2019t afford to live anywhere near where they work.\n\n\n\n\n\nCafe owner Ie-Tehn Kwee sees the flow-on effects every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The issue is there are less houses available than people need. And some people own way more houses than they can live in. And if those houses were more available, things would ease.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Australia's Housing Minister, John Carey, says the state\u2019s economy and population growth are behind the pressure \u2014 and insists the government is \u201cdoing everything it can.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe points to $5.8 billion in housing investment and 3,800 social homes delivered over four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Government says it recognises more needs to be done \u2014 but argues it is increasing supply through national housing funds and by partnering with the states to build more rental homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor families like Emily\u2019s, big plans and long-term promises don\u2019t change the immediate uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may well be their last Christmas in this rental.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Labor has unveiled its final pitch to both the Greens and Coalition, as it tries to secure support for its environmental law overhaul.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1,500 pages of reforms are before a Senate inquiry, however, the government is dialling up the pressure to meet its self-imposed Christmas deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe committee has heard from industry, business and environmental groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns vary, from streamlining approvals, weakening environmental protections and ministerial discretion undermining the reforms, to reporting requirements that could delay projects.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Labor faces a Christmas crossroads over its environment laws reboot\n\nWith only two days left of the parliamentary year, Environment Minister Murray Watt is urging the parties to \"get this done\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The act of parliament you're talking about is 25 years old, it is hopelessly out of date and broken, it's gotta be fixed now,\" he told Sky News on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can keep talking about this for years or we can actually work together to pass these reforms this week.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has obtained a copy of the concessions sent to the Greens and Coalition ahead of their party room meetings on Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's on offer.\n\n\n\nThe Greens\n\nThe Greens have been calling for a ban on native logging, with Labor instead assuring the party on Sunday that the native forestry industry would need to comply with the proposed new national environmental standards within three years.\n\n\n\nBuilding on the momentum, Labor has sought to address concerns around the expansion of coal and gas by excluding them from the national interest exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also limit the fast-tracking of fossil fuel projects as well as restrict them from new streamlined assessment pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a deal is struck with the Greens, the government will not go ahead with plans to hand over a water trigger or assessments for projects based on surface and groundwater impacts to the states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will review the bilateral agreements with states, giving them assessing powers or approvals in some instances. Either way, the minister will retain ultimate decision-making powers, even if a bilateral agreement is in place.\n\n\n\nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is part of the committee scrutinising the environmental protection laws, arguing three years for the native forestry industry is \"too long\". Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Last month, Watt ruled out the Greens' demands for a climate trigger, which would see projects rejected if they worsen carbon emissions or impact climate change.\n\n\n\nThe Coalition\n\nThe government tried to alleviate concerns that penalties for breaches are too high \u2014 up to $1.6 million for individuals or $825 million for businesses \u2014 by stating they would only apply in \"most serious and egregious breaches\".\n\n\n\n\n\nControversial \"stop work\" orders that halt projects will only be in place for a maximum of 14 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minister will have the power to set KPIs as well as sack the head of the proposed National Environment Protection Agency, addressing concerns they would have too much power.\n\n\n\nOf the seven demands tabled by the Coalition last week, two key items are missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amendments do not provide workable definitions of the unacceptable impact test for high-polluting projects that result in their refusal, or what constitutes a net gain or parameters for demonstrating how the project minimises harm or improves the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe definitions, along with no attempt to address scope 1 and 2 emission reporting requirements, are expected not to fly with relevant industry stakeholders.\n\n\n\n",

They're usually not traditional employees with stable hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal was negotiated between the Transport Workers Union, ride-share company Uber and Doordash and is before the Fair Work Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing years of fighting by gig workers and the Transport Workers Union the deal delivers minimum conditions and pay standards for food delivery riders.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal secures a 25 per cent wage increase above the minimum, provides injury insurance and access to employment records.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also guarantees the right to protection from unfair algorithmic dismissal, where an automated computer system judges how effective a worker is and sacks them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister for Employment and Workplace Relations Amanda Rishworth says these reforms are a world first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMinimum standards, including minimum rates of pay, to ensure that we don't have sort of sub slavery conditions in this country, and so there are workers that had fallen through the cracks, and we took action to fix that law and the agreement that's been struck between the TWU and the platforms is a really profound one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal also mandates that the platforms must pay for both dispute resolution processes and accident insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Secretary of the Transport Workers Union Michael Kaine says there will be a formal consultative process under this new system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUber Eats and DoorDash have engaged with the union constructively and in good faith to reach this position. That is a testament to the system that the Albanese government put in place, that is a system that requires these applications to first go to the road transport advisory group, a formal consultative body under the new system, and compel parties to talk to each other about how best it would be to get standards in place. Then if the impasse, or if there is an impasse that needs to be broken, the Fair Work Commission sits ready to act. \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nUtsav is a food delivery driver in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is a member of the Transport Workers Union, and is passionate about the reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says sometimes drivers will be on the road and there's not enough work, causing people to sit there making hardly any money at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes will shift the system from a commission-based model to one guaranteeing a minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe drivers that are alongside me, they were crazy enough, the TW members were crazy enough to take that fight, and they've passed laws. They passed, they've been involved with the negotiations. They've done intense negotiation with the companies, and we're this close now to actually get minimum standard. And when I say this, I am proud, but I'm not proud as well, because we're not talking about a decent pay. We're talking about minimum wage. Let that sit with that everybody. It's a minimum wage that we've been fighting for over the last seven years, minimum conditions. It's for this win is for every worker who can now take a sick leave, who can now work 40 / 50, hours and stay home, spend some time with their families.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCanberra food delivery driver Nabin Adhikari calls the new right to be consulted an unprecedented change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are having a consultation, right, something like we always wanted, for always wanted to speak with someone when we have there is a sudden change from the algorithm or the platform makes a change, and now we are getting that chance. How powerful is that? How powerful a worker, for a worker, when they are making a change, just for the sake of the money, now, they have to discuss with the consult with the worker. Finally, worker will be having a voice. I think that is the most powerful thing...more than the pay, than the Insurance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister Rishworth was asked about the loophole in the unfair deactivation laws that resulted in the reinstatement of drivers deactivated for severe misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe responded by saying that the laws were only intended to prevent workers from being unfairly dismissed by algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery rider deserves to be safe...Equally, the code of deactivation was also about ensuring, what we had heard that too many drivers were being deactivated based on an algorithm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nUber Eats currently charges a 30 per cent commission on every order.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil now workers have been paid based on this commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo who will pay for the new minimum wage?\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the increased costs to pay gig workers be passed on to consumers, or will they be absorbed by the platforms?\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Alex Feen. a senior lecturer in work and organizational studies at the University of Sydney says the answer is somewhere in the middle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's likely consumers will have to pay slightly higher prices for their deliveries. It may come somewhat from the restaurants who are using these services, and we may also see that the platforms are having to perhaps give up some of their cuts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Kaine says that he hopes that the multinational platforms absorb most of the financial burden.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he believes consumers will be willing to tolerate a modest price hike in exchange for fairer worker conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you asked the average Australian, would you be okay if you paid a few cents more for your delivery, knowing that the worker who's knocking at your door has proper pay, is appropriately looked after if they're injured, and has terms and conditions that can ensure they can look after themselves and their families. I think that most Australians would say yes to that as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal now awaits the decision of the Fair Work Commission, which holds the authority to either approve or reject the agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "James Lew also distracts us with some lollies in the set and costumes design, although the karaoke performances that punctuate the show \u2013 as light relief! \u2013 are a sin against music. Composer and sound designer Guy Webster not only assails our ears with excruciating songs (albeit in keeping with the idiom) sung badly, but backs up the comic-book action with comic-book sound effects, consisting of more explosions of white noise than is fair on the ears. By the time the morals about mother-daughter relationships and having the courage to break one\u2019s own rules engulfed us, I just wanted to be somewhere else. Vying for the silliest play I\u2019ve seen, this made a director, playwright and actors who are capable of good work look fourth rate. MUSIC\n\nFREEDMAN JAZZ\n\nThe Neilson, November 22\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Twenty-four years ago, pianist Andrea Keller won the inaugural Freedman Jazz Fellowship, and now she was one of a trio of judges announcing saxophonist/composer Sam Gill had won this year\u2019s $30,000 fellowship. Gill will pursue compositional studies, collaboration and recording in New York over the next two years.\n\nWhile the windfall can be life-changing, the evening again felt more of a concert than a competition, with the four finalists performing in one of Sydney\u2019s best venues, with musicians of their choice. It was a testament to the diversity and creativity of Australian jazz that all four sounded like no one else in the music\u2019s history. Gill performed three of his compositions with an iteration of his band Coursed Waters, featuring pianist Novak Manojlovic, electric bassist Christopher Hale and drummer James McLean. Instantly we were assailed by the piquancy of Gill\u2019s soprano saxophone sound and the intriguing outside-of-the-box nature of his sophisticated compositions, with their rhythmic switchbacks and radically changing vistas. On Double Down, he turned to his more usual alto saxophone for a piece that could have been the love child of a menage a trois between Anthony Braxton, Frank Zappa and Nino Rota. It allowed the players maximum creative scope, including a Manojlovic solo that swelled and ebbed with the rhythm section to create an extraordinary sense of the music arriving in waves rather than metered time. After a glorious solo from Hale\u2019s six-string bass, the band converged on a sudden starburst of energy that one felt as a physical jolt. But then trumpeter Niran Dasika would have been a worthy winner, too, initially elevating us to the heavens with celestial solo trumpet \u2013 although any angels involved were of the fallen variety, with digital looping, circular breathing and vocal growls used to supernatural effect. When joined by guitarist Lawrence Folvig and drummer Kyrie Anderson, the impact was nothing short of visionary. The guitar hummed and sang like some natural phenomenon, while Anderson was endlessly inventive both texturally and rhythmically, and the trumpet cried out its songs of quiet desperation. In its conceptual scope, this was not a trio, but a three-piece orchestra.\n\nPianist Wilbur Whitta\u2019s trio with bassist Cameron Undy and Alexander Inman-Hislop was utterly engrossing in its sheer playfulness and its ability to make jazz minus the cliches. Again, the compositions were notable for their originality and internal contrasts, with Whitta\u2019s playing effortlessly blending blitheness and conviction. If Perth singer Holli Scott didn\u2019t quite rise to the heights of the other three, she was engaging on her own terms, proving an imaginative lyricist, composer and singer, whose music drifted and swooned like a morning-after reverie. Her songs were performed with trumpeter Jessica Carlton and guitarist Dom Barrett, who ensured that dreaminess remained the prevailing aesthetic, even if the trio was reportedly compromised by sound issues. THEATRE\n\nCowbois\n\nThe Seymour Centre, November 22\n\nUntil December 13\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nThis is a noble-hearted, gun-twirling yet dismayingly middling Australian premiere of Charlie Josephine\u2019s 2023 queer western comic fairytale that rides into Sydney town. Making too much of its saddle of progressive morality, this Siren Theatre production of Cowbois stints the energising camp and soaring spirit needed to vindicate its overlong runtime, going down like slow service on watery whisky.\n\nFor all of director Kate Gaul\u2019s good intentions, it only occasionally comes into itself as a radical, celebratory, liberated reimagining of a genre that traditionally loves a binary. Emily Cascarino, Faith Chaza, Branden Christine, Rory Spinks, Jules Billington, Jane Phegan and Amie McKenna. Credit: Alex Vaughan The play is set, naturally, in a small-town saloon. Unnaturally \u2013 some could say \u201cqueerly\u201d (an overused joke) \u2013 there are almost no menfolk here. Aside from the liquor-shaky sheriff and a precocious boy (referred to as \u201ckid\u201d), the husbands all up and left to join the gold rush a year ago, valiantly promising their wives they\u2019d return with a fortune. Another unnatural thing: the town was built to be an exceptional forward-thinking haven, its two founding principles \u201cno guns, no politics\u201d. However, neither of these are upheld. And when fugitive outlaw Jack Cannon swaggers into town, a new kind of man wanted for murder and wanted in a second, sacrilegiously biblical way, its petticoated inhabitants are left weak-kneed, round-eyed and fundamentally shook. New lawless awakenings are about to happen \u2013 and not even the returning wave of toxic masculinity that crashes down when the boys get back can reinstate the old oppressive \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nJules Billington is our gunslinger in red, infusing as much tender kindness as cocksure masc into the trans baddie. There\u2019s not a whole lot of substance behind the performativity of their character, though, and Jack\u2019s romance with married Miss Lillian (Emily Cascarino) seems to gallop on subversive lust alone (do they have one intimate exchange before professing love to one another?). An impossible event between them confirms the British playwright\u2019s story to be a wistful, better-world fantasy. A live band in the rafters provides subtle atmospherics, comic sound effects and backing for a few song and dance numbers. The actors weren\u2019t cast to excel in this form of entertainment, with a lack of talent and gusto in throat and on hoof making you wonder why what\u2019s billed as \u201cfeel good\u201d so often feels bad. Brockman\u2019s dramatic lighting and Emelia Simcox\u2019s set, featuring clamshell footlights and enormous yellow drapes with purple tassels, battles the underwhelm with immersive aesthetics. One\u2019s heart can\u2019t help but clench in gender-affirming plot moments, too, particularly those involving vulnerable transformation. The sweetest is when \u201cMiss Lucy\u201d, inspired by Jack, shucks off her long skirts to become Lou (Faith Chaza), brave and beaming in jeans and necktie. Sheriff (Matthew Abotomey) also gets a cheer for self-expression of repressed femininity with silk. Clay Crighton (previously on piano and violin, who also contributed original music and lyrics) is a second-act show-stealer as Charley Parkhurst, a hilarious drag caricature of a rival outlaw. His entrance interrupts a long and scattered argument between the townsfolk about new and old values. The most conservative voice is then conveniently shot by dainty hand, and his death promptly passed over by a hammy, action-packed shoot-out. Lord knows the messages of Cowbois are important in a backsliding world. But this desperado could do with more fire in the belly, their steed a swift kick with sharp spurs.\n\nMUSIC\n\nBach Mass in B minor\n\nSydney Chamber Choir\n\nCity Recital Hall, November 22\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd With his genius for contrapuntal combinations carrying deep musical and symbolic significance, Bach constructed the great four-part fugue, Donna Nobis Pacem, which concludes the Mass in B minor, so the pleas for peace pile harmoniously on top of one another, each beginning before the previous one has ceased and overreaching it (a \u201cstretto\u201d in musical terms) to create a sonic image of collective yearning. The swelling sonority and translucent texture of the Sydney Chamber Choir and the Muffat Collective orchestra under Sam Allchurch in this number encapsulated all the virtues of the performance that it brought to such a glowing close: clarity, balance, judicious tempi and an absence of unwanted accent or distortion. Conductor Sam Allchurch. Credit: Robert Catto\n\nThe striking opening chords that begin the Mass were sung with an unforced, open sound, allowing pure vowels and the music\u2019s harmonic richness to convey the necessary emphasis. The ensuing expansive five-part Kyrie fugue flowed with a deeply embedded, unhurried pulse. For the Christe, soprano Sara Macliver and alto Sally-Anne Russell created a nicely edged duet sound and their pealing imitation in the second theme was like the playful eddies of running water. For the second Kyrie, the choir returned with a tone of measured seriousness. The choruses of the Gloria and the addition of a brilliant battery of three trumpets require, of course, more animation, but Allchurch\u2019s broad metric direction ensured the music was emblematic of joy rather than over-excitement. Concertmaster Matthew Greco led with light precision, aptly demonstrated in the nimbleness of his and Macliver\u2019s ornamentation in Laudamus te. Illustrating the two-in-one theme implicit in the text of the Domine Deus section, flute players Melissa Farrow and Mikaela Oberg wove threads of silvery filigree against Macliver and tenor Andrew Goodwin, the latter singing with smoothly tanned finish and blooming projection. Russell sang the Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris aria with full sound and rich colour, memorably bringing the same qualities to the darker depths of the penultimate Agnus Dei just before the final chorus. Bass David Greco enlivened the Quoniam and Et in Spiritum Sanctum arias with pointed, elastic articulation that accentuated the natural rhythmic emphasis of the complex melodic line.\n\nWhile the orchestra retuned after the Credo, Allchurch regrouped the chorus to facilitate the double-choir format Bach uses for the Osanna. The regrouping also highlighted the broad antiphonal strokes of the Sanctus, which swayed majestically like great tolling bells and gave the music of the Donna nobis pacem (which had been heard earlier in the Gratias agimus fugue with the former grouping) a more focused, brilliant finish. When performed as well as it was here, Bach\u2019s Mass inevitably creates a sense of awe and wonder at the extent of human imagination and craft. What better way for Sydney Chamber Choir to end its 50th anniversary season. MUSIC\n\nSam Fender\n\nShowring, Entertainment Quarter, November 21\n\nReviewed by ROD YATES\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 In 2019, British singer-songwriter Sam Fender played his debut Sydney show at the 500-capacity Oxford Art Factory.\n\nFast-forward six years \u2013 during which he\u2019s amassed three UK No.1 albums, a Mercury Music Prize for this year\u2019s People Watching LP and, in June, a sold-out show at the 80,000 capacity London Stadium \u2013 and his star has risen significantly. Among the 15,000 people flowing through the gates of the Showring, the constant stream of Newcastle United shirts suggests his expat appeal remains strong. However, when the North Shields-born artist asks how many in the crowd are British and how many are Australians, the loudest cheer comes from the locals, affirmation that his songs of everyday life and blue-collar tribulation have resonance beyond his home country. Sam Fender\u2019s star has risen significantly. Credit: Georgia Griffiths On this night, those songs sound majestic.\n\nThat Fender opens his biggest-ever Sydney show not with a mainstream hit but the deep cut Angel in Lothian suggests this is a man not tied to the staid old traditions of arena rock but one who has faith in his material and his band to make it a convincing opener. His backing group has swelled to a seven-piece over the years, a younger, northern English answer to Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band, and they look like they\u2019re having the collective time of their life. That they can pull off the howling noise-punk rock of Howdon Aldi Death Queue \u2013 introduced by Fender as a \u201cstupid song\u201d, and arguably the only set-list misstep of the evening \u2013 and follow it with a track as nuanced and elegant as Spit of You is a byproduct not only of the hundreds of shows they\u2019ve played together but their history as friends stretching back to their teenage years. The real stars, though, are the songs themselves. Anthems such as Seventeen Going Under, People Watching and triumphant closer Hypersonic Missiles blend wildly melodic hooks with Fender\u2019s lyrical talent for making his deeply personal experiences resonate with the masses. He begins The Dying Light \u2013 a song that addresses suicide and those \u201cwho didn\u2019t make the night\u201d \u2013 solo on piano before shepherding it to a triumphant, hopeful, full-band climax. The Borders delivers an additional element of joy when a fan is invited onstage to play guitar; recent single Talk to You (the recorded version of which features Elton John) sits as comfortably in the set as older songs such as Will We Talk?",

    "text": "I meet Allen on Chapel Street in South Yarra, the suburb where she boarded at Melbourne Girls Grammar and one of the enduring anchors of her life. She lives in neighbouring Toorak, and represented the former seat of Higgins from 2019 to 2022. Abacus Kitchen and Bar, where we sit at an airy corner table, is her local \u2013 a place she drops into with her children when they visit Prahran Market. Katie Allen. Credit: Simon Schluter Before we order, Allen continues to talk me through her diagnosis. While the public only learnt of her cancer after election day in May, she had kept it a secret for 18 months, a decision that left her feeling like she was fighting it alone. Now she speaks about it without hesitation, which she says can be too much for some. It\u2019s as if she is finally exhaling after holding her breath for far too long.\n\nReturning to November 2023 \u2013 the morning after Jemima noticed her yellowing eyes \u2013 Allen found the second sign she had been dreading: white stool. She didn\u2019t try and explain it, she didn\u2019t try and take away the pain because you can\u2019t. Katie Allen Now in Point Lonsdale, she and her husband Malcolm had planned a quiet Melbourne Cup weekend. From there, they immediately drove to Geelong Hospital for a scan. Within an hour, a doctor walked in, sat down and told her simply: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a one-centimetre lesion in your pancreas.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t try and explain it, she didn\u2019t try and take away the pain because you can\u2019t,\u201d Allen says. \u201cShe knew that I knew what that meant.\u201d It was cholangiocarcinoma \u2013 a cancer of the bile ducts that is rare, aggressive and notoriously hard to treat.\n\nAs a doctor, Allen had delivered news like this to parents before. Now she was on the other side. \u201cI wept and she waited.\u201d Allen recognised instantly the dissociation she had seen so often. \u201cThe shutters come down \u2026 you have to give them the bare bones and then say nothing else. I knew that was happening with me.\u201d Within days, she was in surgery. Her tumour was removed, but the risk of recurrence was high \u2013 almost inevitable. She and Malcolm discussed stopping work, selling the house, travelling.\n\n\u201cBut it is just not us,\u201d she said. They agreed instead to carry on. She told fewer than a dozen people: her four children \u2013 Monty, 29; Jemima, 26; Arabella, 24; and Archie, 22 \u2013 and a handful of close family. You go out for dinner, and you have the extra, or you order the champagne, and you get the French, you just say \u2019why the f--- not. Katie Allen With the preselection for Higgins days away, Allen even kept the truth from her staff, claiming she\u2019d had her gall bladder removed. She refused to trigger a sympathy vote. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be defined by the C-word,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to vote for me, or not, because I had cancer.\u201d\n\nOnly after recounting the diagnosis do we turn to lunch. Allen orders the prawn and blue swimmer crab cake with confit kipfler, pickled watermelon radish and squid ink; I choose the Mooloolaba grilled swordfish with reef coconut sauce, potatoes and pangrattato. We share a plate of broccolini. Allen is trying to put on weight. She is noticeably lighter, but she remains bright, animated and determinedly stylish, pausing to reapply her trademark pink lipstick before a photo. Loading As her colleagues in Canberra would attest, Allen has always been forthright, but now she speaks with the certainty of someone who knows exactly how precious time is: \u201cMalcolm said a couple of weeks ago, \u2018this is a bitch of a disease but gosh it has brought some beautiful moments\u2019.\u201d In the two years since she was diagnosed, there is a new rule in the Allen household: you always order the good stuff.\n\n\u201cYou go out for dinner, and you have the extra, or you order the champagne, and you get the French, you just say \u2018why the f--- not\u2019,\u201d she grins. But the extra bottles of Dom aren\u2019t for Allen. She stopped drinking 12 years ago \u2013 ironically, to reduce her cancer risk. At Abacus, we indulge in tall glasses of homemade lemonade. If her illness has taken much from her, it has also drawn her already tight-knit family closer together. In 2024, all four of her children were living or studying in Britain. But when December came, they all flew home to spend time with their mum \u2013 the cancer still a secret. Subtle excuses kept the extended clan away, allowing a two-week cocoon at home. \u2018The kids are amazing, they are my greatest story \u2026 They are very loving children.\u2019 Katie Allen \u201cI was crying the whole time,\u201d Allen tells me through floods of tears. \u201cIt was the best two weeks of my life ... It was so gorgeous.\u201d\n\nHer children created a treasure hunt for her Christmas present, hiding gifts in the places she is at her happiest, like a book for the hammock in the garden. \u201cThe kids are amazing, they are my greatest story \u2026 They are very loving children.\u201d This month she became a grandmother for the first time, a milestone that brings both joy and a fierce determination to keep going. Allen\u2019s own childhood was similarly close. Born in 1966, she grew up in Albury, where her father Bill was a much-loved local physician. She tagged along on his ward rounds at seven, the moment medicine imprinted itself. \u201cHe loved what he did, he had a beautiful bedside manner.\u201d\n\nAfter boarding school at Melbourne Girls Grammar \u2013 where her grandmother, mother and daughters were also educated \u2013 she briefly flirted with journalism, making it to the final six for a cadetship at a Melbourne newspaper. Monash medicine won out. He kissed me and we have never looked back. We have been together ever since. I have never looked at another man. Katie Allen Two decades before that fateful Cup weekend when she was diagnosed with cancer, Allen met her husband trackside at Flemington on Cup weekend. It was 1988, Empire Rose won the two-mile race, but Allen insists she \u201csnagged\u201d the best prize \u2013 an Englishman called Malcolm. \u201cHe kissed me and we have never looked back. We have been together ever since. I have never looked at another man. Never thought about another man. He is my rock.\u201d Back in that Geelong hospital room, it was Malcolm \u2013 a management consultant \u2013 who refused to let the diagnosis upend their lives. Through floods of tears, Allen recalls turning to her husband, who was already encouraging her not to give up on her dream of returning to Canberra.\n\n\u201cOh Malcolm, it\u2019s over,\u201d she told him. Loading While she absorbed the emotional shock, he shifted instantly into what she calls management mode \u2013 encouraging her to run for Higgins, even as she recovered from surgery. \u201cI was doing it to keep him happy,\u201d she admits. \u201cHe just wants to keep kicking the cancer can down the road.\u201d Allen went on to win preselection for Higgins. Five months later, the seat would be abolished in a redistribution, forcing her into a bruising contest for neighbouring Chisholm. In September 2024, she defeated the preselected candidate, Theo Zographos, to secure the party\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cNow and then, if someone would do something really mean, I would think \u2018If only you knew I had cancer\u2019,\u201d she jokes. Katie Allen outside a polling booth on election day in May 2022. Credit: Scott McNaughton By early 2025, with the federal election approaching, her symptoms crept back. Mild abdominal pain at first, then more unmistakable signs. She knew she should see a doctor, but put it off \u2013 a delay she now recognises as denial. A conga line of Liberal colleagues visited Chisholm to help her campaign. She never once revealed her private health battle. She knows the ethics of running while harbouring a cancer diagnosis will always prompt debate \u2013 voters deserve transparency and candidates owe them the full picture.\n\nAllen grappled with the possibility of winning, relapsing, and triggering a by-election, but her family pushed her to live fully, not withdraw. \u201cMy family all said it\u2019s better I get in there and do it.\u201d A tropical cyclone pushed the election to May, stretching out the campaign as her health deteriorated. Some nights she plunged into the pool three times to soothe the pain. Katie Allen in 2022. Credit: Simon Schluter \u201cI rang my doctor and said \u2018I am deteriorating\u2019 and she knew what that meant.\u201d\n\nStill, she did not want her illness to influence the result. Loading On May 3, she lost Chisholm. The following Monday, she was in hospital for tests and immediately started chemotherapy. The cancer had spread. After the relapse, she said her prognosis \u201cdropped significantly\u201d, shifting her into what oncologists call a different \u201cprognostic environment\u201d. She doesn\u2019t like the term \u201cterminal\u201d but acknowledges it is incurable. Still, she holds tight to what she calls \u201cdeluded hope\u201d \u2013 the stories of rare patients who defy the averages.\n\n\u201cThere are some people who are the outliers who last a year or two, and you want to be the outlier. \u201cI know it is deluded hope, but what else have you got.\u201d A new clinical trial \u2013 one she nearly missed \u2013 has given her new hope. Before that, she had just wanted to make it to Christmas. \u201cIf you are on a treatment with no side effects, that is a good quality of life.\u201d Allen is approaching life with vulnerability and pragmatism, largely free of regrets \u2013 except for Canberra, where she wishes she had done more to champion the party\u2019s moderate faction.\n\n\u201cI went in to change the Liberal Party from the inside \u2026 but I completely and utterly failed. I did my best, but I didn\u2019t make much difference.\u201d Katie Allen with John Howard in 2022. Credit: Eddie Jim During her time in Canberra, she crossed the floor on the religious discrimination bill to vote on amendments that would prohibit vilification of and discrimination against children based on sexuality and gender identity, protecting all LGBTIQ+ students. She also joined colleagues pushing for the Murugappan family to be returned to Biloela. And she was part of the internal push to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. She jokes that she should have been \u201cthe Pauline Hanson of the moderates\u201d, but said she mostly remained quiet when she should have spoken up.\n\nDespite the recent turmoil in the state and federal Liberal parties, Allen hasn\u2019t given up. She sees promise in younger women such as Jess Wilson and Amelia Hamer, whose rise she has quietly supported \u2013 even hosting events for Hamer as her health wobbled. Loading Her medical background means she does not romanticise what lies ahead. She supports Victoria\u2019s voluntary assisted dying laws for others but doesn\u2019t wish to use them saying she has great faith in the health system. When her time does come \u2013 a date she hopes has been pushed further back thanks to her new trial \u2013 she hopes to spend her final days at home. But she is not grieving her life.",

But such simplicity keeps all eyes on the so-called queen of rap-pop, whose exaggerated facial expressions offer all the theatrics needed. And when you aren\u2019t looking at Doja, you\u2019re watching her tiger-striped band, many of whom do the robot or roll around on the floor during instrumental interludes. Loading For someone who\u2019s known for sending the occasional barb to fans online (remember when she told us to \u201cget a job\u201d?), there sure is a lot of love in the room. The crowd \u2013 many of whom are dressed in \u201980s workout gear and inflatable cow costumes \u2013 carry Doja through each track, particularly Take Me Dancing and Boss Bitch, singing so loudly it practically drowns out the backing tracks. This clearly tickles Doja, who smiles ear-to-ear each time she holds the mic out. Her commitment to the fans shines brightest when she stops the show to ask the crowd to help get a fan who has fainted to safety. It may not be her strongest gig, but you know you have a star on your hands when a singer who is losing their voice can still make a packed crowd purr.\n\nReviewed by Nell Geraets\n\nMUSIC\n\nDaniel M\u00fcller-Schott with Konstantin Shamray \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre, November 25 German cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott has returned to Melbourne, filling Elisabeth Murdoch Hall with the glorious resonance and many-splendoured lyricism of his 1727 \u201cEx Shapiro\u201d Matteo Goffriller cello. Cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott Noting his instrument is almost exactly contemporaneous with Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No. 3 in C major, BWV 1009, M\u00fcller-Schott brought an expansive, larger-than-life feeling to this classic. Like the rest of the suite, the Prelude was flexible yet rhythmic, powered by artistic and technical assurance. Other movements were beautifully characterised, with especially telling contrasts between the sprightly Courante and the intense yet subtly coloured Sarabande, while the well-known Bour\u00e9e and the rustic Gigue were buoyed by joyous rhythmic energy.\n\nTogether with Russian-born, Australian-based pianist Konstantin Shamray, M\u00fcller-Schott offered great insights into Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Sonata in D minor, Op. 40. Once again proving himself to be an extraordinary colourist, M\u00fcller-Schott gave the opening two themes a life of their own, with exchanges between instruments deftly handled. Loading At the centre of the work, the third-movement Largo became a soul-searing expression of heartache. This vividly etched lament was surrounded by remarkable vigour, both in the second-movement Allegro and in the impish finale. Throughout, the artists harnessed Shostakovich\u2019s formidable array of technical demands to memorable musical ends. From the outset, Brahms\u2019 Cello Sonata No. 2 in F major, Op. 99 overflowed with grandeur and ardent passion. Thanks to the superb instrument, the pizzicato in the Adagio had an unusual depth, while the middle section of the Allegro passionato was yet another instance of the cello\u2019s voice taking on an almost-human quality. The cheerful, hope-giving finale set the seal on arguably one of the best concerts of the year. How wonderful to see M\u00fcller-Schott\u2019s generous, open personality and poetic musicianship garner him quite a following of young fans, teeming in the audience and listening with rapt attention.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nCABARET\n\nMeow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMalthouse Theatre, until December 6 The original Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s tale involves a girl enamoured with a pair of red shoes. As punishment for her vanity, the shoes are cursed, and she\u2019s forced to dance in them forever. Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes is a retelling of the Hans Christian Anderson classic. Credit: Brett Boardman Even when her feet are amputated, the shoes still dance tauntingly before her. Yes, it\u2019s grim, as a lot of these unvarnished fairytales are wont to be, but this is Meow Meow\u2019s Red Shoes, and she has her own ideas about the classic story. It\u2019s the third iteration in her fairytale series, after The Little Matchstick Girl and The Little Mermaid. The show opens on a comic note with the performer (otherwise known as Melissa Madden Gray) being dragged on stage by her legs. This self-confessed \u201ceternal showgirl\u201d has lost her muse; she\u2019s a marionette slackened with existential angst and more attuned to the sorry, lustreless state of the world.\n\nIndeed, Dann Barber\u2019s set contributes to the post-apocalyptic mood with its mountain of debris and a plastic curtain. Meow Meow climbs up and down this graveyard of rubbish, singing and emoting and resplendent in a black mini dress, bouffant hair and even bigger plumed headgear. The musicians (Mark Jones, Dan Witton and Jethro Woodward) are in distressed tuxedoes, and between them play an astonishing array of instruments including piano, guitar, double bass, drums and tuba. Dann Barber\u2019s set contributes to the post-apocalyptic mood. Credit: Brett Boardman Meow Meow\u2019s energy is unflagging: aside from the actual dancing (sometimes lopsidedly with different footwear), she also hops, crawls and does the splits. She can be vulnerable one moment (hobbling around trying to find her missing red shoe), and brazen the next, in an interactive aside with the audience to \u201credistribute the wealth\u201d. There\u2019s a lot going on in this digressive show with its various sprays against communism, capitalism and world greed in general. It\u2019s a springboard of ideas, but it\u2019s difficult to find the skein of narrative about the titular red shoes in between all the play and hijinks.\n\nMeow Meow does challenge Andersen (Kanen Breen) at one point about the fairytale\u2019s punitive corrective against a girl who simply wanted to dance. Maybe dancing isn\u2019t the problem, but the cure? Maybe we need more art in our lives? The ambiguities are open to interpretation. Could Red Shoes also be a self-reflexive comment about diva narcissism seeking external validation or the peripatetic career path of artists? Kanen Breen and Meow Meow in Meow Meow\u2019s The Red Shoes. Credit: Brett Boardman In the movie of The Wizard of Oz, after a series of (mis)adventures, Dorothy\u2019s ruby shoes took her home; in this story they have the opposite effect: they\u2019re a talisman of the dangers of creative ambition, of the neverending desire to prove oneself, even if that aspiration can take you (like Meow Meow\u2019s career) far away from home. For those hoping or expecting linearity and cohesion, you\u2019d leave bewildered with this rag-tag assortment of song, dance and spectacle but if you\u2019re a fan of cabaret with a twist of the absurd, Meow Meow\u2019s charisma and rich honeyed tones, Breen\u2019s operatic tenor, and the trio of musicians provide theatrical ballast.\n\nReviewed by Thuy On\n\nMUSIC\n\nRyman Healthcare Spring Gala: Joyce DiDonato \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Symphony Orchestra, Hamer Hall, November 21 Making her first major Australasian tour, American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato confirmed her reputation as one of this generation\u2019s most compelling classical singers in a memorably sophisticated account of Berlioz\u2019 song cycle Nuits d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 (Summer Nights) with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under chief conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn. American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato performs with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Credit: Laura Manariti DiDonato took evident delight in revealing the elegant sensuality and profound emotion flowing from this supreme expression of French romanticism. Charting a journey from innocence through loss to new life, the six songs were a perfect vehicle for her vocal versatility. Keenly alive to musical and textual nuance, DiDonato\u2019s voice of liquid gold brought simple delight to Villanelle, exquisitely contrasted by the ruminative ecstasy of The Spectre of the Rose in which the climactic line, \u201cI come from paradise\u201d was superbly seductive. Contemplating isolation and death, On the Lagoons, Absence and At the Cemetery brought out the alluring, expressive qualities of her lower range, before radiant enthusiasm marked her sailing to The Unknown Isle.\n\nA generous performer, DiDonato offered two encores: a steamy Habanera from Bizet\u2019s Carmen and then, making a link between her native Kansas and the Land of Oz, a heartwarming rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Beginning with Rossini\u2019s William Tell overture may seem hackneyed but the initial rapturous cello solo brilliantly delivered by David Berlin offset the all-too-familiar gallop. Jaime Mart\u00edn conducts the Spring Gala. Credit: Laura Manariti After interval came two-thirds of Respighi\u2019s Roman trilogy: The Fountains of Rome and The Pines of Rome. While the latter undeniably ends in a blaze of glory, such unimaginative programming forfeited the opportunity of introducing a large audience to the least heard and arguably the best of the three suites, The Festivals of Rome. That said, the orchestral playing was consistently engaging and the Berlioz especially was sensitively accompanied. However, the night belonged to DiDonato, who hopefully can dazzle Melbourne again soon.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nPixies \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Festival Hall, November 19 Female bass players are to the Pixies as drummers are to Spinal Tap: they\u2019ve had a lot of them. Kim Deal (1987-2012), Kim Shattuck (briefly in 2013), Paz Lenchantin (2014-2023) have all come and gone. Black Francis of Pixies performs onstage at Festival Hall, November 19, 2025. Credit: Richard Clifford Now it\u2019s Emma Richardson\u2019s turn to provide the driving bass and sweet harmonies that are so crucial to the Boston-born band\u2019s loud-quiet-loud dynamic. And she stands tall, literally and figuratively, towering over frontman Black Francis, guitarist Joey Santiago and drummer Dave Lovering when the four embrace and take a well-earned bow at the end of their blistering 32-song two-hour set on Wednesday night. This is the back-to-back album show, in which the band play Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991) track by track, throwing in a handful of faves at the end for good measure. On this tour, they alternate set lists across two-night engagements, with the second set featuring a best-of collection from across their catalogue, plus some songs from their new album, The Night the Zombies Came.\n\nPixies are, and always have been, a no-nonsense noise machine. As they take the stage \u2013 unadorned, apart from a winged P and four spheres that morph from planets to eyes over the course of the show (nods to the respective albums\u2019 cover art) \u2013 Francis takes a sip from a mug and says \u201chello time travellers\u201d before offering some background on the origins of Cecilia Ann, the opening track on Bossanova (a cover of a Surftones song recorded in 1964 but not released until 1988, its origins are in French composer Gabriel Faure\u2019s Sicilienne \u2026 apparently). It\u2019s the fourth time I\u2019ve seen the Pixies live (the first was at their absolute peak in 1989), and before they\u2019ve played a note, Francis has already said a lot more than in the three other shows combined. Pixies are, and always have been, a no-nonsense noise machine. Credit: Richard Clifford He\u2019s in a good mood, and no wonder. The band is tight as, ripping through songs at a rate of knots. \u201cThank you. The songs are kind of short, I know,\u201d he says at one point. And he\u2019s right. Some barely pass the 90-second mark. His voice is different than it was in 1987, when their debut mini-album Come On Pilgrim blasted onto the world. It\u2019s gruffer, scarred by the screams that litter many tracks, but the counterpoint upper register is still intact. It works.\n\nSantiago\u2019s guitar work is as good as ever, searing, surfy, scintillating, and on Velouria, Allison, Is She Weird and Dig For Fire, the band sounds as good as they ever did. The energy kicks up a notch when they trip into the Trompe set, with barely a pause to note the transition. This is a punkier set of songs, fast and furious, and the crowd becomes more energised as the set wears on. Loading The influence of Pixies, who recorded just four studio albums in their first wave of mutilation before breaking up in 1993 (and another five since reforming in 2004), has been well noted, with Nirvana and Weezer among the many to have paid homage. But on this night, with this set list, the backward lineage was apparent too: a cover of Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s Head On, the aforementioned Surftones track (and a general infusion of surf-guitar sounds throughout), and, in the final bracket of non-album tracks, Neil Young\u2019s Winterlong. It was a welcome reminder that although it sometimes felt like they\u2019d arrived from nowhere \u2013 or, maybe, from outer space \u2013 the Pixies were indeed born of this world. They\u2019re strange, jarring, at times unfathomable, but on this form they remain as vital as ever.\n\nReviewed by Karl Quinn\n\nDANCE\n\nBrigid \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, until November 22 The room fills with haze while the dancers lie prone, hiding their faces. It\u2019s an opening scene that recalls those old images of Celtic romance: an orange twilight glow, frothing vapours and ancient figures half-buried in the earth. Brigid is an evocation of the pagan Irish goddess of the same name Credit: Agust\u00edn Far\u00edas Brigid, created by Alice Heyward and Ois\u00edn Monaghan, is an evocation of the pagan Irish goddess of the same name, one of the folk divinities of that legendary age before recorded history \u2013 the imagined time of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. We actually know very little about this daughter of the Dagda. Her story has been partly obscured by the later Saint Brigid of Kildare, the famous abbess and miracle-worker, the so-called Mary of the Gael who turned dirty bathwater into beer.\n\nIn looking back to the older Brigid, Heyward and Monaghan seem to take her obscurity as a cue. This is a work full of uncertainties and strange vacancies amid the rattling, racketing old-style jigging that fills the space. Loading The three performers \u2013 Heyward, Monaghan and Oonagh Slater \u2013 slowly raise themselves. You feel the heaviness of it, the work of dragging something old and earth-loving back into motion. They fall and fall again, landing with real weight. The dancing arrives gradually. At first, they fall into step together: a fleeting suggestion, perhaps, of the goddess\u2019s triple aspect. Then they separate, moving with apparent freedom across the long, windy gap between lights set at either end of the studio. Monaghan\u2019s boots slap the boards like antique flat irons. Or maybe hammers. Is this a vision of Brigid in her role as patroness of blacksmiths? The loud percussive steps follow closely the work of sound designer Gregor Kompar, who also performs live.",

Check-in Not unlike the flux of defecting A-listers and preternaturally beautiful folk who\u2019ve sent Byron\u2019s average attractiveness levels into the stratosphere, The Bower Byron Bay continues to hold its own among the town\u2019s newest crop of glamorous coastal stays. She\u2019s had a fair whack of work over the decades. The former 1970s motel was first reimagined as a luxury hotel in 2017 \u2013 the original designer and co-owner, Taliah Lowry, laced Byron\u2019s beachy essence with a touch of New York grit, inspired by the US city\u2019s industrial-cool Bowery neighbourhood. A recent two-year upgrade has once again restored its sheen and grown its footprint, with new additions including a guest lounge, hotel bar, swish new reception space, an onsite spa treatment centre and four beautiful new suites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe look The new guest lounge \u2026 currently used for functions. The Bower Barn. The Bower\u2019s old-school roadside motel past is easy to spot, thanks to a concrete carpark that dissects the property, but creative firms Studio Plenty and Tanev Muir have added plenty of tropical greenery and flair to the mix. No two accommodations are the same, though they do share a penchant for organic textiles and tones, modern art, dark woods and custom furnishings by Byron artist Alexis Williams. The revamp has also seen all rooms upgraded with king beds, and a beautiful new lounge and bar area that\u2019s currently reserved as a function space. The one-bed Bower Barn and five-bedroom Bower Cottage at the back of the property are among the most striking and sought-after stays \u2013 think charming white weatherboard exteriors, picket gates, pitched ceilings, rustic wooden beams, and luxe touches like a glass-roofed bath (for bathing under the stars) and a private cedar mineral spa. Outside, a striking solar-panel-powered circular heated magnesium pool, hugged by palms and day beds with privacy curtains, is the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe room One of the new luxury Bower Studios. Shades of grey \u2026 the Bower Studio. We\u2019re staying in one of two newly launched Bower Studios. The sultry combination of a giant four-poster bed, distressed mirrors, and sheer black curtains framing a freestanding stone bath feels both luxurious and, erm, 50 Shades? The cabin\u2019s entrance is steps from the car spot, tucked behind a whitewashed wall for extra privacy; inside, a soaring pitched roof and spectrums of charcoal tap into that smouldering New York warehouse vibe. There\u2019s a kitchenette, Nespresso machine, mini-bar stocked with snacks and local favourites, complimentary bath salts and decadent Hunter Amenities. It takes a second to master where to find the various light switches; tech is generally great, with fast Wi-Fi and a smart TV with casting capability. The beautiful rough-hewn wooden side tables and handmade ceramic lamps look neat, but don\u2019t leave much room for a phone or book. The open-plan en-suite is all sorts of ravishing, between the egg-shaped bath overlooking a glass-walled garden and floating vanity. Food + drink\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pool is serviced by a licensed pool bar. There\u2019s no onsite restaurant, though the spiffy pool area is serviced by a licensed pool bar offering a basic menu of Curatif canned cocktails, drinks and bar snacks \u2013 and you can BYO food from local eateries or pre-order a hamper (if you\u2019re after something freshly shaken, you\u2019ll have to venture into town). Next door, The General Store cafe mixes heritage appeal with a sun-kissed aesthetic, and the coffee and brunch dishes don\u2019t miss (the smoked bacon is a revelation). Out + about Pixie Italian dining room. It\u2019s a 15-minute walk to town and 20 minutes to the beaches. Happily, the buzzy Jonson Lane area is only a block away and boasts some of the town\u2019s best restaurants \u2013 tuck into aperitivo and chilli-laced tubes of mezze maniche pasta with pork sausage at Pixie Italian, or soak up the punchy Asian flavours and deep list of lo-fi drops at Bar Heather.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can\u2019t swing a yoga mat without hitting a day spa in these parts, but the Bower\u2019s petite new guest-only spa is well worth securing a booking for, offering treatments with luxe Mukti Organics products; the 90-minute facial has me floating back to my room. The verdict The pool, the bath ... file it all under \u201cridiculously good-looking\u201d and chalk it down to the Byron effect. A worthy base from which to hit the town\u2019s boutiques, beaches, and bars, The Bower\u2019s latest refresh cements it as one of the better luxury options in town.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size This month Australia implements laws to address the toxic aspects of online life, but not so long ago, it was apparently perfectly fine for a good portion of the internet to direct astonishing levels of hatred and vitriol at a young girl from California. People who go viral for reasons beyond their control typically disappear back into the scenery of non-internet life. Rebecca Black never flinched. Black is now touring Australia as part of the Spilt Milk festival, alongside Kendrick Lamar and Doechii. She\u2019s also headlining her own shows, including her largest ever at Melbourne\u2019s Forum Theatre. If you think her presence has something to do with Friday, the song that launched her to fame and became the most viewed YouTube video the year it was released, you\u2019re living in the past. A brief recap is all the Friday affair deserves. When Black was 13 she recorded a novelty pop song and video clip with an LA company that offered ordinary folks just such an experience. Friday was intended to be a throwaway bit of fun to share with friends, but somehow the music video ended up online right at the moment when memes and meanness were becoming inextricable. Until that point, social media had been a largely benign place full of lolcats and rickrolling and pokes. By 2011, however, the tone had started to shift. The default voice was snarkier, the humour had become crueller, and any innocent could find themselves hoisted up for public ridicule. The socials democratised the angry mob, promising a pitchfork and flaming torch for everyone. Black \u2013 at age 22 \u2013 who was just 13 when her pop video went viral for all the wrong reasons. Credit: It\u2019s hard to overstate just how vile the response to Friday became, with strangers posting the most violent and juvenile comments towards a random kid whose home movie had so upset them. From medieval witch trials to the screaming fans of the Fab Four to the Twilight and Tay-Tay stans in recent times, there\u2019s a certain sort who have a screaming fit whenever they see a girl having fun on her own terms. Today it\u2019s Black: 1, Haters: 0. She never quit. This year the 28-year-old played a DJ set at Lollapalooza, one of the largest music festivals on earth. Punters who only remembered her as the Friday girl were floored. The set-list from that gig includes titles familiar from the pop canon \u2013 from Britney\u2019s Toxic to Bjork\u2019s Hyperballad to Addison Rae\u2019s Fame Is a Gun \u2013 but you won\u2019t find the bootleg cuts she spins anywhere on Spotify or Shazam. They\u2019re familiar while also illustrating a deep knowledge of dance culture today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Black DJs, she says, \u201cI\u2019m there to highlight the tracks that I really love and feel attached to, that I find in the depths of SoundCloud or some random part of someone\u2019s discography. I love playing throwback stuff because I want to play the remixes that I wish I could hear in a club, that I know would be played deep in some Barcelona queer underground club.\u201d TAKE 7: THE ANSWERS ACCORDING TO REBECCA BLACK Worst habit? Picking my nails, which I\u2019m doing right now. Greatest fear? Dying. The line that stayed with you? The concept that life hands you exactly what you need when you\u2019re ready for it. You\u2019ll never be handed a situation to get through without the ability to undertake it. Whether or not it is actually true I\u2019m not sure, but it has certainly helped me hold onto hope when I needed it. Biggest regret? Missing moments with family over the years. It takes effort, and I don\u2019t want to have regrets over that. Favourite book? In the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado. It\u2019s an incredible book about toxic queer relationships. The artwork or song you wish was yours? There\u2019s a lot. The new ROSAL\u00cdA album is something only she could do, even having the concept to do it. If you could time travel, where would you choose to go? The future. I want to know what\u2019s up. But I\u2019m afraid of time travel, for sure. That mix of pop appeal and underground edginess is what Black\u2019s own songwriting has evolved into. Her latest album, Salvation, is a banging mix of abrasive hyperpop (think SOPHIE or Charli XCX) and the kind of ambitious songwriting that fell out of favour for the first few decades of this century. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m listening way more to things from the past than I am things that are happening right now. That\u2019s where I learn,\u201d Black says. \u201cIf you go back and listen to some of the big pop stars of the \u201990s, like Madonna, Janet, that was a time where pop was actually really interesting. \u201cListen to some of the instrumentals that were on Velvet Rope, Ray of Light, Erotica. That was a time where I think pop was at its best and was celebrated because it was constantly trying to push itself forward ... I think that was why pop died for a second. It felt like that ethos got lost. Everyone was just trying to make something really digestible.\u201d The teenage Black might have been treated harshly by the internet, but like most people her age, her music tastes were discovered online. \u201cI don\u2019t think the way that my relationship with music developed was much different to a lot of my fans,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really a relationship with the internet, a relationship with artists who were really intrinsic to the internet. I mean, I was a Tumblr kid growing up. My audience were my peers.\u201d That might be why the comments on her videos today speak so starkly of the way our online culture has changed. They\u2019re full of admiration for the artist and passionate about their love of her new work, occasionally punctuated with shocked praise from viewers who didn\u2019t realise this was that Rebecca Black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do think there are pieces of the internet where there is an intention to treat others with kindness,\u201d she says. \u201cI see moments where the internet is trying to police itself in ways.\u201d Offline, too, she\u2019s found her people. The Rebecca Black of 2025 has become something of an icon in queer club spaces, where she finds so much of the most interesting music is happening. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of places outside of the US that are way more advanced in the queer spaces they have, including Australia, Melbourne particularly.\u201d She also does a lot of meet-and-greets as she tours. \u201cI love them because I really love understanding who gets it? Who gets me in this way?\u201d Black is now a DJ and something of a queer icon. Credit: Getty Images for Kohls The lyrics on Salvation sometimes flirt with possible references to Black\u2019s past \u2013 the title track\u2019s chorus declares that \u201cI don\u2019t need you to save me/I already saved myself\u201d \u2013 but the vocals also toy with voice and character to blur personal experience and the playfulness of fiction. \u201cSome of those characters are ways that I can channel the parts of myself that only exist in my head,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s ways that we talk to ourselves or talk about things with ourselves in our heads that I would never articulate, even with a partner. That lives just for me. But the other place it can live is in a song. Those characters are the most deeply personal in a way because I\u2019m disguising them as something that\u2019s a different version of me, but it\u2019s actually probably the truest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

The precinct includes a shiny retail shopfront on Little Collins Street and beneath it the Cellar & Caffetteria, the subterranean wine bar and bottle shop with cocktails curated by Matt Bax (Bar Americano) and a snackable, shareable Italian menu.\n\nThe Dining Room incorporates not only the restaurant, but a moody bar one level down, also helmed by Bax. Chef James Evangelinos is offering a menu that focuses on technique-driven, French-influenced fine dining with mostly classic flavours. Meals start with the old-school European hospitality of complimentary bread, featuring several bakes of the day centred around a lofty brioche loaf glazed in caramel.\n\nThe $75-a-head fruits de mer is essentially a table-blanketing seafood course, a selection of raw and creatively cooked bites such as moreish abalone croquettes. Beyond, find gently poached Shark Bay scallops with charred white asparagus and a liquid-nitrogen-charged almond dressing spooned on tableside. Sweet marron is served in a delicately flavoured marron bisque alongside a roulade of summer squash.",
