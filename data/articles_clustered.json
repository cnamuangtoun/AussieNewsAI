(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) (AP)\n\n\"Overall, these changes are a net negative for global growth and productivity, reversing some of the gains we saw during the era of globalisation.\n\n\"They will also put upward pressure on neutral interest rates.\"\n\nYeaman thinks dominant factors in geopolitics and the world economy are working against a lower cash rate.\ufeff\n\n\"This new era will see sustained higher levels of economic and market volatility, greater domestic investment, add structural pressure to government budgets, and drive more government intervention in the economy, creating bifurcated markets,\" he wrote.\n\nThe major factor driving all this is geopolitics, with conflict, sanctions, industry policy, tariffs and restrictions on investment and exports unsettling the conventional order of co-operation and global capital.\n\nDecades of economic co-operation are long gone as economic security shapes world financieal markets.(AP Photo/Richard Drew) (AP)\n\nYeaman notes the disruptive trade policies of US President Donald Trump are partly to blame, but there is far more at play.\n\n\"This is a deep structural change, not a temporary Trump phenomenon \u2014 as some would like to think.\"\n\n\"Investors shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there is a far bigger game at play here that goes well beyond a standard trade negotiation.\n\n\"This is a long fight for strategic power; it is not primarily about short-term economics.\"\n\nAmid the stark outlook, the CBA update has a couple of bright spots: the potential for the expansion of AI and renewable energy to restore balance.\n\nIn contrast to many forecasts, Yeaman thinks rapidly evolving technology will lift productivity in the global economy.\n\n\"Job displacement is harder to measure, and estimates vary wildly. Most job classes will be affected in some way by AI, but suggestions of mass unemployment appear alarmist.\"\n\nThe drive for cleaner energy will deliver huge investments in the long term, but also possibly higher prices. (Dean Purcell/New Zealand Herald via AP)\n\nThe huge investment in clean energy should spark new tech innovations and deliver more diverse low\u2011cost energy, despite the views of Trump.\n\nBut Yeaman writes reaching that point is likely to be a rocky ride.\n\n\"Most notably, energy security and reliability will be sorely tested, bringing with it the risk of higher power prices for consumers and industry.",

    "text": "A\ufeffustralia's birth rate \"crisis\" made headlines when the Bureau of Statistics revealed it had fallen to its lowest level ever recently - supposedly well below \"replacement\" rates at 1.48.\n\nBut a focus on that number serves only to obscure the bigger structural issues in Australia's demographics and spread \"doom and gloom\", some experts say.\n\nGlenn Capuano from data insights company .id said Austalia's birth rate had been falling fairly steadily since it peaked in 1961 at 3.54, and hadn't been above 2 since a brief rally in 2008-2009 attributed to the government's baby bonus.\n\nREAD MORE: Two men drown after being swept from Melbourne pier in extreme weather\n\nExperts say Australia's birth rate isn't as gloomy as it appears. (Getty)\n\nIt's a trend mirrored around much of the world, Capuano said, but it's not predicted to fall much further.\n\nThe biggest focus for demographers right now is the ageing of first-time parents - 32.1 years for mums and 33.9 years for dads.\n\nCost-of-living pressures, the receding prospect of home ownership, education and the desire to establish a career are pushing the timeline back for starting a family.\n\nWould be parents are being priced out of cities. (Kate Geraghty)\n\nAnd breaking down demographics at a local level bears this out, with more children being born, and earlier, in more affordable regional areas and the outer suburbs of big cities.\n\n\"They're areas where you can, presuming you're a decent salary, afford housing,\" Capuano said.\n\nMigrants to Australia, usually stereotyped - sometimes negatively - as having larger families, are also bucking the trend.\n\nCapuano said birth rates to couples resident in but not born in Australia were actually lower than those of Australian-born couples.\ufeff\n\nREAD MORE: Footage shows moment Russian drone strikes Ukrainian kindergarten\n\nCost of living pressures are in play. (iStock)\n\nHe said these trends meant Australia needed to consider how it could support new families - and how the country should look at immigration.\n\n\"If you have a look at these birth rates, population decline sets in at around 2050,\" Capuano said.\n\nThat's when deaths per year begin to outnumber births per year.\n\n\"We want to avoid a situation like they have in Japan, where they're losing one million people more a year than are being born,\" he said.\n\n'Doom and gloom'\n\nEmeritus Professor of Demography Peter McDonald from \ufeffthe Australian National University points to flaws in the methodology used to calculate Australia's birth rate, saying Australians, as in citizens, had one of the highest birth rates in OECD countries.\n\nHe points to the \"impossible scenario\" of births in Victoria rising 9400 in 2024, while falling nationally by 4100.\ufeff\n\n\"According to Births Australia 2024, from 2023 to 2024, the number of births in Victoria increased by 9400 while, in the rest of Australia, the number of births fell by 4100.\n\nFirst time parents are getting older. (Getty)\n\n\"This does not reflect reality because the births data are births by year of registration, not by year of occurrence,\" he said.\n\n\"Registrars in NSW and Victoria very often do not process the births that have occurred in sufficient time for them to be included in the ABS stats for a year, but then excess births are recorded in the following year when the registrations catch up.\"\n\nThe ABS noted the same phenomenon in its report.\n\n\"Births Australia 2024 shows that the average number of births that women have had by age 50 was most recently 2.02 and this number has been flat for the past five years,\" McDonald said.\n\n\"This, termed cohort fertility, is a better way to measure fertility because the annual number, the total fertility rate (TFR), is affected by the delay of births, most of which take place at a future time.\ufeff\"\n\nAustralians have one of the highest birth rates in OECD countries, one expert said. (Getty)\n\nHe said another reason for the falling TFR was a surge in Australia's \"temporary\" population, such as international students, whose fertility rate was \"close to zero\".\ufeff\n\n\"As an indication of this effect, the TFR in 2024 was 1.64 for Australia women and 1.25 for overseas-born women. A rate of 1.64 is one of the highest in the OECD countries,\" he said.",

But she never gave up hope of seeing her again.\n\nIn the 1970s, OL was 18 years old and unmarried when she gave birth in southern Tasmania and had her baby taken from her.\n\nHer case was heard in the Supreme Court of Tasmania.\n\nOL was one of a cohort of 18 women represented by lawyer Angela Sdrinis.\n\nMs Sdrinis said while she was \"pleased the government had come to the table\", for her clients who were unwell or elderly, the announcement had come too late.\n\n\"The trauma they've suffered has impacted on them physically and mentally and justice delayed is justice denied,\" she said.\n\nInstitutional abuse lawyer Angela Sdrinis on Hobart street, May 2022.

These women need to draw a line in the sand and move on as best they can once their suffering has been acknowledged.\"\n\nMs Sdrinis said Victoria's $30,000 one-off payment offered under its redress scheme was \"absolutely woefully inadequate\".\n\n\"If you want to compare it to the national redress scheme for child sexual abuse survivors, that's $150,000. Various schemes for compensation, such as the stolen generation, are significantly more,\" she said.\n\n\"I think the government should be looking at the upper range of what a redress scheme can pay rather than that very low range we have in Victoria.\"\n\nScheme open to mothers only\n\nAttorney-General Guy Barnett said redress offered \"a more trauma-informed pathway\", avoiding adversarial court processes.\n\n\"As well as offering a more trauma-informed avenue than civil litigation, the scheme will also offer affected mothers access to ongoing counselling support,\" Mr Barnett said.\n\nHe said the government would consult widely in developing the scheme, but at this stage the financial support would only apply to affected mothers.\n\n\"It's unlikely to be fully established until next year, but there will be transitional arrangements put in place,\" Mr Barnett said.\n\n\"Transitional payments [will be] made to those affected and who may be in circumstances where they cannot wait for the full scheme to be established.\n\nCalls for redress for forced adoption victims Ten years ago, Tasmania acknowledged the pain and suffering caused by forced adoptions. There are now calls for the state government to open the way for victims to seek compensation.\n\n\"The redress scheme is not going to be limited to a particular number. The terms of conditions will be consulted on in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nSpeaking on ABC Radio Hobart, a caller named Adam told Mornings host David Rielly he had been separated from his mother as a child because she was \"young and single\".\n\n\"She unfortunately died in 2019.

Their business shows we can do service kills, which is also good for our business.\"\n\nKAPCO beef boxed up at the Rum Jungle abattoir. (ABC Rural: Matt Brann)\n\nTour to see the final product\n\nWhen ABC Rural visited the abattoir, KAPCO had invited a group of young station workers to see the cattle being processed first-hand.\n\nJuwaan Skinner from Myroodah Station said seeing the cattle \"getting cut up\" and put into KAPCO packages was good.\n\n\"There's not much local beef [for sale] in the Kimberley,\" he said.\n\n\" So this is giving people a taste of Kimberley beef. \"\n\nKAPCO employees seeing first-hand their cattle being processed and turned into branded beef products. (ABC Rural: Matt Brann)\n\nIvan Watson, 21, from Derby, said he was enjoying working in the cattle industry like his forebears and being a part of a project getting beef into communities.\n\n\"It means a lot to see this [because] people living in Kimberley communities, they're isolated and [food] prices are high,\" he said.\n\n\" So when this beef goes back, the whole idea is to provide affordable meat, great quality, that's what we want for our locals. \"",

(Supplied: Victorian National Parks Association)\n\nMr Arthur said the proposed changes could affect \"guest-facing and operational services at Mt Stirling during winter\".\n\n\"There will be no change to summer operations,\" he said.\n\n\" Mt Stirling has been operating with a financial deficit for many years and the aim of any potential changes is to maintain Mt Stirling as a nature-based destination, while reducing running costs and ensuring greater financial sustainability. \"\n\nBluff Spur Hut at Mount Stirling is used for shelter by skiers in winter. (Wikimedia Commons: Bluff Spur Hut / Shogun / CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\nMr Arthur said those impacted by any change were being consulted with.\n\n\"ARV's priority has been to first consult with the staff and volunteers who could be directly impacted,\" Mr Arthur said.\n\n\"Once we have a clearer view of the options available, we will determine what wider consultation may be appropriate.\"\n\nThe state government has also been contacted for comment.\n\n'Unique winter environment'\n\nThe resort's winter services are used by a number of school groups from Melbourne and the local area.\n\nMansfield Steiner School has used the mountain as a hub for cross-country skiing for four decades.\n\nIn a statement, principal Glenn Hood said the resort offered \"a unique winter environment\" that gave users \"an experience of the natural (relatively undeveloped) alpine environment\".\n\n\"Mansfield Steiner School, along with schools all over the state, has used Mt Stirling in winter as a hub for cross-country skiing since its inception, and we greatly value its role in experiential and environmental education for all Victorians,\" he said.\n\nMansfield Steiner School's students have visited Mt Stirling regularly over the years. (Supplied: Mansfield Steiner School)\n\nMayor of Mansfield Shire Steve Rabie said he hoped any changes would not \"impact the bottom line\" of Mansfield's visitor economy.\n\nThe High Country town of Mansfield is home to a number of ski shops and is en route to Mount Buller and Mount Stirling.\n\n\"We wish them all the very best in their endeavour to save taxpayer money,\" Cr Rabie said.\n\nMount Stirling received 7,919 visitors in 2024 (YTD), a seven per cent decrease from the previous year.",

(LSEG Refinitiv)\n\nIt has garnered additional attention with the sweeping success of the animated KPop Demon Hunters.\n\nBut since peaking in June, shares have declined more than 16%, signaling that investors are growing cautious about its lofty valuation and lack of details about subscriber growth.\n\nThe company's forward price-to-earnings multiple stands at nearly 40, far more than other media companies and major tech names.\n\n\"Shares have enjoyed a strong run this year, so expectations were already high, and with the valuation sitting above its long-term average there's added pressure not just to deliver but to exceed,\" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nNetflix forecast revenue of $US11.96 billion for the fourth quarter, compared with Wall Street's projection for $US11.9 billion. Third-quarter revenue was roughly in line with forecasts, at $US11.5 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe company has ventured into advertising and video games to diversify its revenue streams, but these businesses have struggled amid shifts in leadership and strategy, along with competition.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix said it recorded its best ad sales quarter in history without disclosing a number.\n\n\"Netflix must demonstrate soon that its ad program can accelerate growth to justify a sky-high multiple,\" analysts at Wedbush said, calling the company's latest guidance \"underwhelming\" after several quarters of standout results.\n\nNetflix stopped reporting subscriber figures early in 2025. The company is banking on its major releases through year-end that include Stranger Things and two NFL games set to stream live on Christmas Day.\n\nHowever, Evercore ISI analysts suggest investors should buy any dip in the stock, noting competitors Disney+ and HBO Max have increased their subscription prices, giving Netflix plenty of cover to boost its own rates.\n\nReporting with Reuters",

It\u2019s grown enormously.\u201d With major road links, a planned train \u201csuperhub\u201d and a future direct rail link to Melbourne Airport, Bracks said that Sunshine was filled with promise. \u201c[The west] will become the hub, the centre \u2026 it is the centre of what is happening around Melbourne, but also around Victoria. That\u2019s its future. And it\u2019s going to be so fantastic,\u201d Bracks said.\n\nThe population of Melbourne\u2019s west is predicted to almost double to 1.8 million by 2050, but demographer Simon Kuestenmacher believes the forecasts are an underestimate. He warns it\u2019s likely that the development of greenfield homes \u2013 which are cheaper to build than high-density housing and fit the \u201cAustralian dream\u201d of a quarter-acre block with a backyard \u2013 will grow faster than expected. \u201cThe infrastructure backlog, that\u2019s getting more intense. So we need much more infrastructure, and mostly what I\u2019m talking about here is connectivity. If we want to become a multi-modal city where we have job clusters \u2026 we need to make sure they\u2019re really well-connected. And if they\u2019re not, the whole system just doesn\u2019t work \u2026 We must spend heavily.\u201d Asked about increasing jobs in the west, Kuestenmacher said past Victorian government planning blueprints had promoted the creation of employment hubs across Melbourne, while simultaneously allowing the development of more office towers in the CBD and Docklands.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not smart because we now have empty B and C-grade offices in the CBD, it\u2019s a bit of a mess,\u201d he said. Loading Kuestenmacher said that as low-grade commercial buildings empty out, they could be replaced further out of the CBD. New jobs hubs, he said, were needed to create an identity to attract specific types of businesses. \u201cSecondary employment centres will eventually work as soon as they find a character or purpose. There\u2019s a lot of work ahead.\u201d Matt Carrick, secretary of the Department of Jobs, Skills, Industry and Regions, said much of the growth in jobs would come from small business operators in transport, logistics, professional services, science and construction.\n\n\u201cThe unsung story is the rise of small business \u2026 over the last five years, the top two municipalities in the country for small business growth are Wyndham and Melton. It\u2019s going to be a phenomenal advantage that will help balance things.\u201d In eight short years, the size of the western suburbs\u2019 professional workforce \u2013 those in fields including finance, insurance, sciences and IT \u2013 almost doubled, rising from about 70,000 to 130,000. \u201cThe associated positive is that professional roles typically employ highly educated people and pay above-average salaries. One downside \u2026 is that these roles tend not to be local,\u201d WoMEDA argues in its report. By last year, 47.9 per cent of western suburbs workers commuted outside the region for work, a figure that is projected to exceed 50 per cent within the next decade.\n\nAlready, workers in Wyndham, in the outer south-west, face an average morning commute time of 56 minutes. The alliance says Melbourne should follow the lead of Sydney and develop a second CBD in Sunshine, and two \u201csatellite cities\u201d in East Werribee and Cobblebank. Age senior city reporter Adam Carey (centre) moderates a panel at the West of Melbourne summit, with (from left) planning expert Peter Seamer, Melbourne University professor Beth Webster, Department of Jobs secretary Matt Carrick and western suburbs councils\u2019 chief executives Celia Haddock (Maribyrnong), Fiona Blair (Brimbank), Roslyn Wai (Melton) and Stephen Wall (Wyndham). Credit: Elke Meitzel \u201cThere are many parallels between the western regions of Australia\u2019s two largest metropolises. However, Greater Western Sydney is further into its journey than the west of Melbourne and is reaping the rewards,\u201d the report argues. It finds that the west of Melbourne and the west of Sydney share similar advantages and disadvantages. Both have a young, diverse and ambitious population, and are expected to absorb more population growth over the next two decades than other parts of the city.\n\nBoth also have higher-than-average unemployment and lower-than-average salary levels, as well as high levels of mortgage and rental stress. Loading In 2017, the Greater Sydney Commission released a 40-year plan to turn Sydney into a metropolis with three CBDs. Gabrielle Trainor previously led Infrastructure Australia and has been involved in developing Sydney\u2019s second CBD in Parramatta, and now, its third in Bradfield. On Wednesday night, Trainor told the summit that lessons from Sydney could be applied to Melbourne\u2019s west, including having a state minister for the region, a research facility and a dedicated infrastructure co-ordinator.",

MUSIC\n\nDANIEL MULLER-SCHOTT PERFORMS TCHAIKOVSKY\n\nSydney Symphony Orchestra, Opera House, October 22\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tchaikovsky is justly renowned for bringing magical colour to child-like stories in his ballet-scores, while Stravinsky is often seen as the architect of Neoclassicism, which placed the musical gestures and forms of the past into new, sometimes incongruous settings.\n\nIn this program, the two giants of Russian music in their respective centuries changed places, Tchaikovsky toying affectionately with 18th century phrase structure in his Variations on a Rococo Theme, Opus 33 and Stravinsky vividly bringing a child\u2019s puppet to life in Petrushka. Cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott. Cellist Daniel Muller-Schott played Tchaikovsky\u2019s Variations with a smooth, wonderfully glowing mahogany sound, stylistic suavity and virtuosic ease. One problem for today\u2019s performers is that the cellist for whom Tchaikovsky wrote the work, Wilhelm Fitzenhagen, added changes Tchaikovsky disapproved, but which have become standard. They arguably push the piece more into a vehicle for technical display and away from Tchaikovsky\u2019s Arcadian view of the 18th century and create passages which might trespass into poor taste, at least from today\u2019s perspective on 18th century playing. In the theme and earlier variations, Muller-Schott\u2019s playing adopted impeccable elegant courtly manners which sat easily with a 19th century view of aristocratic propriety. It was in the slow sixth variation, just after the cadenza that Muller-Schott introduced a tone of expressive emotionalism where one glimpses Tchaikovsky\u2019s true feelings peeking out from behind the gallant mask.\n\nBy contrast in the second half conductor Lionel Bringuier led a sharply edged performance of Stravinsky\u2019s Petrushka (1946 version). The opening tableau was balanced into a picture of swirling chaotic excitement. Pianist Louisa Breen dispatched the difficult piano part with aplomb. The most memorable moments were the many solos from SSO players, where Stravinsky gives simple fairground-like tunes an unexpected piquancy or timbre, or jams them together in unrelated blends and keys in a small, wincing clash, like a tooth smarting sharply while eating an ice-cream. The concert began with another child\u2019s story, The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice by Paul Dukas, fixed immovably in the minds of a whole generation as Mickey Mouse in Disney\u2019s Fantasia. Bringuier did not rush the tempo, allowing the SSO players to bring out the delicacy of wind and string writing with polish and refinement. It also maintained a comic, deliberate character to the plodding broomstick whose transformation into an automaton unleashes such unmanageable chaos, giving a foretaste, no doubt, of our own adventures to come with AI. MUSICAL THEATRE\n\nCALAMITY JANE\n\nStudio, Sydney Opera House, October 19, until November 16\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Sometimes a show and a venue press each other\u2019s buttons in a way that makes each perspire just a little, and bundles of joy are instantly born in the form of smiles on people\u2019s faces. Calamity Jane and the Opera House\u2019s Studio are such a coupling. The room becomes the Golden Garter saloon in Deadwood, South Dakota, in the 1870s \u2013 a place where women are scarce and horses are skittish.\n\nWere some omniscient history of theatrical depictions of the fabled Jane penned, three would surely rise to the top like so many whiskey-laden burps: Doris Day in the 1953 movie, Robin Weigert in TV\u2019s superlative Deadwood and Virginia Gay in this ongoing production of the musical derived (in 1961) from the film. Virginia Gay in the title role of Calamity Jane. Credit: Daniel Boud I missed it at Hayes Theatre (where it was initially in Michelle Guthrie\u2019s Neglected Musicals series), at Belvoir, and in its gallops around Australia, so join the hoedown seven years late, but forever grateful finally to witness Gay giving the performance of a lifetime. The show\u2019s also a supreme example of Richard Carroll\u2019s art as director, including making the audience so many extras in the Golden Garter, and the way the production keeps poking itself in its own theatrical eye. The musical is basically the movie with a stagecoach full of extra songs, though Carroll tweaks the characters and story-telling, while musical director Nigel Ubrihien slims the orchestral score down to just piano (plus the cast playing a bunch of stringed instruments for The Black Hills of Dakota). They found no solution to saving the saccharine Love You Dearly, however. Gay is a force field of charismatic energy as Jane, roaming the stage and audience, looking for trouble, confused about what her heart\u2019s telling her, and discovering her \u201cfemale\u201d side with all the wonder and suspicion of a child being given a shiny new bicycle. When she sings the show\u2019s famed Secret Love, she doesn\u2019t compete with Doris Day\u2019s pristine sweetness, but rips the song apart, and, in the process, performs some amateur cardiovascular surgery on us, too. Gay\u2019s Jane is almost a female Falstaff in her scope.\n\nLike Carroll, choreographer Cameron Mitchell, designer Lauren Peters and lighting designer Trent Suidgeest give the cast a handful of aces with which to play. While Andrew Cutcliffe may not have the strongest singing voice, his idiosyncratic Wild Bill Hickok is a worthy foil for Gay. Victoria Falconer (usually a musical director) is sassy and feisty as Susan, the \u201cniece\u201d of saloon owner Henry Miller, played with bravura by Phillip Lowe. Kala Gare is an ideal Katie Brown, the woman who, deliciously ambiguously, moves in with Jane, and then snares Lieutenant Gilmartin \u2013 admirably played by Kaya Byrne. Whether you loved the movie, adored Deadwood or saw this production before, see it in the Studio. It\u2019s the funniest, whip-crackingest, shot-drinkingest, heart-warmingest show in town. MUSIC\n\nCONVERGENCE, AUSTRALIAN STRING QUARTET\n\nUtzon Room Opera House, October 21\n\nReviewed by Peter McCallum\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd After the Australian String Quartet\u2019s current leader, Dale Barltrop, had given a quick gloss of the Quartet\u2019s 40-year history, cellist Michael Dahlenburg noted wryly that he also was turning 40 this year. Since it was founded by then leader, violinist William Hennessy, in 1985, each of the quartet\u2019s positions has been occupied by seven different players. However, the vision of performing nationwide and championing Australian music remains. As my former colleague, the late SMH critic Fred Blanks, once quipped, it is still the same old axe, it is just that the head and handle have been replaced seven times.\n\nThe Australian String Quartet at the Utzon Room. Credit: Kate Moroney This concert began with the String Quartet No. 1, Elegies & Dances (2008 revised 2012) by Sydney-based Paul Stanhope, a single-movement work with wide expressive range. The piece began in deep and thoughtful mourning with wailing motives that became transformed into vivid expressions of life and energy as they became more active. The quicker section involved sharp irregular rhythm and rapid textural evolution, until, at its most frenetic point, the propulsive urgency started to dissolve. As the music returned to its opening mood, it acquired warmth, acceptance and seemed released from anguish. Elegies & Dances proved to be an effective pairing with Benjamin Britten\u2019s String Quartet No. 2 in C major, Opus 36 (1945) which followed. Both are works of high craft, develop their ideas with clarity, and position themselves cogently but unselfconsciously within their respective historical and cultural contexts. In Stanhope\u2019s case that included references to the sounds of Indigenous culture, while for Britten, it involved building on forms and gestures from before the time the string quartet was developed and paying homage to English composer Henry Purcell. After a concise first movement and a scurrying, quietly energetic second, it reached its central point in the third movement, Chacony. As with some works of Beethoven and Mahler, it is a slow movement whose expressive profundity overwhelms the rest of the work to the point where any continuation is impossible. The repeated bass on which the movement is built contains an obsessive iambic rhythm like an insistent limp which eventually was smoothed out, leading to a glowing close of ringing C major chords. Schubert\u2019s String Quartet No. 14 in D minor, Death and the Maiden, opened incisively, but the ASQ eased up on \u2018hammerblow\u2019 articulation, to allow longer phrases to cut a deeper swathe. Lyricism and ornate melodic expressiveness adorned the second movement and the finale raced with hypnotic precision, accelerating at the end to make a lemming-like dash to the final bar.\n\nMUSIC\n\nJEAN-EFFLAM BAVOUZET CELEBRATING RAVEL\n\nCity Recital Hall, October 20\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Maurice Ravel wrote music of exquisitely blended harmonic tartness and sweetness, clothing old forms with new colours and gradations of light and shade that bathe imaginary structures with magic and mystery. In the case of his works for piano, he also wrote some of the most difficult music ever written, although in the hands of Jean-Efflam Bavouzet that challenge was as nothing, like a dancer also being able to walk. Jean-Efflam Bavouzet. Celebrating Ravel\u2019s sesquicentenary, Bavouzet played, in one recital, most of his major keyboard music, including the haunting, Pre-Raphaelite Pavane pour une infante defunte, his scintillating evocation of fountains, Jeux d\u2019eau and his three major keyboard collections, Miroirs (1904-5), Gaspard de la nuit (1908) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914-17).\n\nTo cap it off, as encore, he gave an astonishing rendition of Ravel\u2019s solo piano arrangement of his orchestral work La Valse (1919-20), a trap for many due to its impractical difficulty, but heard here with outstanding clarity of gesture in all its passion, distortion and excess. Bavouzet spanned Ravel\u2019s wide range of textures with affinity, subtlety and mastery. He began with an early rarity, Serenade grotesque, which seems to evoke Punch-and-Judy masks, mixing leering taunts with an expressive melody of touching simplicity. The piece anticipates Ravel\u2019s interest in the grotesque that was to reach such towering heights in Scarbo (from Gaspard de la nuit) and La Valse. Between the appearances of the strangely beautiful melody the Pavane, Bavouzet created softly voiced episodes of transparent stillness. His performance of Jeux d\u2019eau contrasted swirling limpid movement with a climax of glistening intensity. In Noctuelles, the first piece of Miroirs, Bavouzet created fleeting, impulsive lightness which glided into ethereal invisibility at the close. Oiseaux tristes was layered with a murmuring background cut through by incisive bright points of painful colour. In Une barque sur l\u2019ocean Bavouzet set up multiple different velocities, counterpointing a solemn majestic theme with rapid glittering eddies and broader waves of threatening turbulence which erupted in a moment of frothy peril. After the quick virtuosic energy of Alborada del gracioso, La vallee des cloches returned to layered stillness. While it was disappointing not to hear Bavouzet\u2019s superb pianism in Ravel\u2019s tender and flirtatious Valses nobles et sentimentales which was originally advertised, the shimmering beauty, ominous distant echoes and fizzing virtuosity of the three movements of Gaspard de la nuit more than compensated. Of the many highlights in the neo-Baroque masterpiece, Le tombeau de Couperin, I will just mention the delightfully piquant astringency he created in the forlane, the tender delicacy of the menuet and the brilliant radiance at the close of the toccata. It is hard to imagine a better way to honour Ravel\u2019s genius. MUSIC\n\nGREGORY PORTER|\n\nConcert Hall, Sydney Opera House, October 20\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nGregory Porter\u2019s voice is like a log fire on a winter\u2019s night. It doesn\u2019t just radiate warmth, it has a comfort factor. It\u2019s the voice of someone who\u2019s worked out a thing or two about this very temporary exercise called life, and wants to ease the suffering and spread a little beneficence with a generosity of heart that\u2019s the opposite of those people who win talent quests by impressing. Porter has bigger fish to fry than merely impressing. A mere nine years ago he was at the old Basement. Now he\u2019s packing out the Concert Hall with fans who know all the songs, having been seduced by the voice of this barrel-chested man in the trademark hat, who can fleetingly remind you of singers ranging from Nat King Cole to Marvin Gaye, yet sounds only like himself. He lets jazz flow into soul as naturally as two rivers meeting, so it\u2019s impossible to define where they merge. Gregory Porter in action on stage at the Opera House. Credit: Johannes Napp Most of the songs are his own, with lyrics about coping, loving, hoping and improving. The latter\u2019s quite an attractive idea, given most of us seem to believe that bemoaning our lot is a form of conversation. You feel the truth of the magnanimity with Porter, not just via the lyrics and the amusing between-song chat, but via the voice itself, which seems to proclaim that goodness is possible, and you leave the two-hour show briefly believing it. His long-term quartet has been augmented by organist Ondrej Pivec, who maximises the inherent drama of a Hammond B-3, and provides another soloing voice to join tenor saxophonist Tivon Pennicott and pianist Chip Crawford. Bassist Jahmal Nichols anchors the music, while also providing the night\u2019s most engrossing solo feature, which builds into a groove so wicked it must be barely legal, and then morphs into two rare covers: The Temptations\u2019 My Girl and Papa Was a Rolling Stone. Drummer Emanuel Harrold remains the joker in the pack: unusually busy for the soul side of the idiom (if not the jazz), and ensuring the music is energised and studded with surprises.\n\nPorter\u2019s anthemic Musical Genocide drops away to just Crawford\u2019s piano, which slips into Waltzing Matilda. Although Porter doesn\u2019t sing it, the audience does, and what could easily have been corny is actually quite touching. More moving is Porter\u2019s Water Under Bridges, ostensibly about a break-up; more pertinently about how his brother helped him cope: a brother who died during the pandemic. Sung with only piano accompaniment this allows us to immerse ourselves in his voice\u2019s richness. Seldom does he unleash its full magnificence, but when he does, as on the spiritual Wade in the Water, you are physically pushed back by its power. The sound was second-rate to start, and never became quite as sharply focused as it can be in this room, although it did keep improving, right through to the second (genuinely demanded) encore. MUSIC\n\nKarnivool\n\nEnmore Theatre, October 19\n\nReviewed by ROD YATES\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 When Karnivool guitarist Mark Hosking steps up to the microphone and thanks the audience for sticking with them over the years, he acknowledges that they are a band that require patience from their fans. They postpone shows, he says \u2013 a reference to the fact that this evening\u2019s gig was originally scheduled to take place last July before illness rendered the quintet unable to perform \u2013 and they take years between albums.\n\nKarnivool in full flight at the Enmore Theatre. Credit: Kane Hibberd Indeed, when their new record In Verses comes out in 2026, it will be only their fourth full-length since forming in Perth in 1998 and will drop a whopping 13 years after predecessor Asymmetry. In the here-today-gone-later-today nature of music stardom in 2025, rare is the band that can treat their release schedule with such disdain yet still command the kind of loyalty that enables them to sell out the 2500-capacity Enmore Theatre with ease. That they share a special bond with their audience is obvious. From the genuine glee that flashes across the face of vocalist Ian Kenny when greeting the crowd to the way in which the punters morph into a mass choir during closer New Day and the thundering Themata, the overwhelming feeling from both band and audience is release. Contributing to that sense is the group\u2019s mastery at creating musical tension.\n\nDrummer Steve Judd\u2019s mindbogglingly complex rhythms and the intricate guitar interplay between Hosking and Drew Goddard combine to form a dark, dense, prog-metal symphony that they tease to a thundering climax in the epic Deadman and a gloriously heavy Roquefort. Of the two new tracks Karnivool have released this year they open with one in Drone and put the other, Aozora, third song in. That they do this rather than go for a cheap win by opening with an old favourite like Cote (which appears later in the set) speaks volumes about the confidence of the band and the trust they place in their audience to go along for the ride. After almost three decades, though, those fans know the deal \u2013 Karnivool will march to the beat of their own drum and indulge their musical whims without any care for the demands of the mainstream. In return, they will deliver a masterful show like this. MUSIC\n\nBURNA BOY\n\nQudos Bank Arena, October 18\n\nReviewed by SHAMIM RAZAVI\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Burna Boy\u2019s current tour takes him places no African artist has gone before, and his first Sydney headline show is no exception: it\u2019s hard to imagine that Olympic Park has ever hosted a Nigerian party of these proportions, with even the food trucks putting on their best impersonations of jollof rice and swallows. Inside the arena, the mood was authentic Afrofusion: an Afrobeats base with aesthetic influences from the rest of the world.\n\nThat African base was ever present \u2013 in the Yoruba-Pidgin lyrics, in the use of the talking drum and shekere instruments, in the infectious familial informality \u2014 but fused with global elements ranging from Kingston Town rhythms to Ed Sheeran aesthetics straight from the badlands of Ipswich: a sound as global as it is grounded. Burna Boy in full flight at Qudos Bank Arena. Credit: Glenn Pokorny Burna\u2019s studio production is glossy and complicated, which in the hands of a lesser artist might have been a disappointment live. Not so for the African Giant: in his case, less polish and more talent actually improved on his overstuffed recordings. His baritone especially benefited from the concert treatment \u2013 with AutoTune dialled back, we were reminded of the charm and intensity that sets his act apart from his peers. In fact, the a cappella intro to It\u2019s Plenty drops the vocal filters altogether and he sounds properly masterful as a result. The price for this willingness to experiment and mix things up was the occasional misfire. Bank on It was transformed with a smooth-jazz vibe, complete with a sax line straight from the Kenny G songbook: more lounge than Lagos; the CGI screen backdrops were more artificial than intelligent, and the occasional keytar on stage, like an escapee from a wedding band, only highlighted the strange aesthetic choices. Not that anyone seemed to mind, judging by the assortment of audience underwear thrown on stage. Shirtless from the second song, Burna Boy worked that rich voice and charisma hard, building to a closing climax of Ye and Last Last. And yet, for all the heat and magnetism, there was something missing \u2013 a looseness and unrestraint that would have transformed this good night into a great one: the gap between smouldering and fire.\n\nMUSIC\n\nGORDI\n\nPlayhouse, Sydney Opera House, October 17\n\nReviewed by BERNARD ZUEL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Though neither of them occurred during the performance, two medical episodes punctuated this show and told us something about Sophie Payten in both normal and Gordi mode, in medical and musical personas. The lesser of them, told in comic semi-pantomime, concerned Payten at the dentist when one of her songs, Heaven I Know, came on the surgery\u2019s playlist like the universe was helping convince them she really was a musician. On stage, that song built from looped and live vocal layers and slowly accreting instruments until we had an alterna-choir that served as a kind of halo around the simple lines of an ending and acceptance. \u201cYeah, I got older, and we got tired/Heaven I know, that we tried.\u201d Gordi aka Sophie Payten performs at the Sydney Opera House. Credit: Gabrielle Clement More seriously, the other story featured a patient of hers \u2013 Payten completed her medical studies during and immediately after COVID lockdowns \u2013 who confronted news of his imminent death with a level of equanimity that would be beyond most of us, leaving an impact on his young doctor.\n\nThe two songs inspired by this experience were not leaden but rather a flow of warm energy that pushed everything forward and a blend of Elliott Smith and Bon Iver as pure pop immersed in hazy winter. Around these three songs, in material that included all the tracks of her new-ish album, Like Plasticine, and scattered shots from previous releases, Payten/Gordi moved between endings and rebuilding, back and forth from thickened layers to modestly proportioned instrumentation, counter-intuitively guitar-pushed vibrant when crushed and synth-filled solemn when emotionally buoyant, and often distorting her voice through various effects as if not wanting clarity to be confused with truth. Songs found her uncertain on questing love (\u201cDo you care? Do you care?/Don\u2019t make me your peripheral lover\u201d), falling on a failure (\u201cI made available a portion of my heart/Not anymore\u201d) and rising again on the certainty of comfort (\u201cI know the pressure you feel seems relentless/But everything is fleeting, except you and I\u201d). And then, closing with Can We Work It Out, on the horns of a dilemma \u2013 ready to believe, but bracing for regret \u2013 she threw at us the bushiest and brightest song of the night with its solid propulsion and almost fizzing slices of vocals. THEATRE\n\nDAYTIME DEEWANE\n\nRiverside, October 18, until October 25\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 1980s Britain, after racist club bouncers wouldn\u2019t give anyone with brown skin their share of night, a new underground subculture emerged. These were the Daytimers, day parties run by South Asian collectives, where shunned ravers could congregate on their own terms, to their own DJs, dancing to new music blending bass-kicked Bhangra, Asian garage and diaspora-mixed jungle. Azan Ahmed sets his award-winning 2022 play at the last Daytimer party, in London in 1997. Sixteen-year-old Farhan (Ariyan Sharma), wonders whether Islam forbids dancing as he scurries nervously in school uniform towards his first-ever rave. His 20-year-old rude-boy cousin Sadiq (Ashan Kumar), bounces about impatiently in wifebeater vest and chains, breaking into rhapsodies on the dancefloor\u2019s true radical principles of defiance, humanism and transcendent release. Ariyan Sharma and Ashan Kumar are excellent as two cousins on clashing coming-of-age trajectories in Daytime Deewane. Credit: Phil Erbacher Built on the twists in its character foils, Daytime Deewane unfolds as a story about these two very different young Muslim men, each trying to define his means and methods of self-respect against the values and expectations of his heritage. It loses its beat in the last stretch \u2013 the time leap to a reunion scene strikes an off-key chord and leaves us with an ambiguous moral takeaway \u2013 but there\u2019s a lot to rate highly in this play about migration, masculinity and faith. Its two leads go point-for-point in endowing Riverside\u2019s Australian premiere with humour and depth. Sharma gives us signature goof as the duty-bound teenage square, cutting Farhan the weirdest of shapes as an aspirational \u201cpeacock\u201d bro while asking where the prayer room\u2019s at.",

    "text": "When I was a kid, I lived near an old guy, Mr Lamont, a retired man who\u2019d once been an accountant. He must have been short of dough because one year, when the Royal Agricultural Show came to town, he hired on as a skeleton. He turned up at the showgrounds where they dressed him in a bodystocking painted with luminous bones and paid him to leap from the darkness, scaring people as they rode the Ghost Train. At day\u2019s end, I\u2019d hang around his front gate and pester him for stories of these emaciated ambushes and their resulting panic.\n\nHe spoke of those Ghost Train adventures in low tones, like it was a secret between us that our fellow townsfolk were such suckers, so yellow, not the heroes they pretended to be. Oh, how those passengers in his stories squealed and swore and buried their heads in each other\u2019s shirtfronts when he appeared from the dark in luminous bones. Sometimes, they sprang out of their train carriages and stampeded for cracks of daylight. If one did it, they all did it, Mr Lamont said. No one lingered. Once the first chicken made a break for reality, the carriage emptied pronto.\n\nCredit: Robin Cowcher\n\nI was a brave boy who would never flee from a slow-moving skeleton that smelt deliciously of licorice and Craven As. Particularly, one that I already knew to be Mr Lamont in a leotard. So I delighted in the terror of that train\u2019s passengers. It brought them down to my size. It bigged me up to theirs. The mother abandoning her kids, shouting, \u201cMy God, it\u2019s real. It\u2019s bones.\u201d The ex-mayor who had once shot a Lee Enfield .303 at Japanese Zeros hollering to his wife to, \u201cKeep it away, keep it away.\u201d The cop-baiting sharpie who wet himself and had to walk along sideshow alley covering his jeans crotch with a pink cloud of fairy floss. Out there at his front gate, Mr Lamont and I laughed until our stomachs hurt. \u201cBlow accountancy,\u201d he said one day. \u201cBeing a skeleton is really living.\u201d\n\nI admired and envied that radiant skeleton\u2019s power to humble hard-nosed matriarchs unto prayer and turn moustache-twirling grandees into scalded hounds hightailing it for safety. It showed me the least of us could do mighty things given a chance. A scrawny nobody in tricked-up undies was humbling big names in the dark. It was Christ-like. What possibilities this world offered a person willing to believe in himself.",

    "text": "It is the equivalent of a VVIP room in the already exclusive dual international club: an elite handful who have the extra flex of having competed at an Olympics as well. In Australia, there are only nine in the last 116 years - and most of them were in the same gold-medal winning team in 1908. Slightly further afield, there are a couple more household names like Sonny Bill Williams and Semi Radradra. So who are the \u201ccrown duals\u201d? The 1908 crew\n\nA year and a day after the NSW Rugby League was founded in 1907, the Australian rugby team embarked on a 41-game tour of the British Isles and North America. It was noteworthy on several fronts; it was the first time they were called \u201cthe Wallabies\u201d, and midway through the seven-month tour, the team won an Olympic gold medal. With rugby included in the London Olympics, the Wallabies beat Cornwall - the side representing England - in a straight final. When the Wallabies returned home, many followed in the footsteps of Dally Messenger and defected to rugby league - mostly to Newtown and Glebe. Within a year or two, most had also won selection for the Kangaroos, making them the first dual international Olympians. Those men were Bob Craig, Jack Hickey, Chris McKivat, John Barnett, Charles McMurtrie, Patrick McCue, Frank Smith, and Charles Russell. The Wallabies side, captained by Chris McKivbat, who won the 1908 Olympic gold medal. Credit: Fairfax Arcvhives\n\nMcKivat stands out among them, having captained the Wallabies in their 1908 tour and Olympic triumph, and then captained the Kangaroos in 1911-12 tour of Britain as well. The skilful playmaker led the Kangaroos to their first-ever Ashes victory over Great Britain on British soil. Dick Thornett Dick Thornett playing for Parramatta. Credit: Fairfax Media The youngest of the incredible Thornett brothers, who were giants of the Australian sporting landscape in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, Richard - or \u201cDick\u201d - was a supremely gifted athlete, who also joined the dual international Olympian club. Dick had big targets to chase as a youngster, with eldest brother John beginning a stellar Wallabies career in 1955. Playing across most of the forward pack, John Thornett played 37 Tests for the Wallabies over the next 13 years, and captained the team as well.\n\nMiddle brother Ken Thornett switched from rugby to league and quickly became one of the 13-man game\u2019s best fullbacks. He was a star for the Parramatta Eels, and played No.1 for the Kangaroos on the 1963\u201364 Kangaroo Tour that won the Ashes in England for the first time in over 50 years. But Dick ended up matching both brothers and playing for Australia in both codes. He played 11 Tests for the Wallabies as a second rower, alongside his brother John, between 1961 and 1963. Dick Thornett (right), with Arthur Beetson and John Wittenberg in 1968. Credit: Fairfax Archive Dick then switched codes in 1963 and played alongside Ken at Parramatta, becoming a dual international when he also went on the 1963-64 Ashes tour with the Kangaroos. Dick played 13 Tests as a front and second rower. But prior to his stellar football career, Dick Thornett also earned the rare distinction of competing for Australia in water polo at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. A burly presence in the water with a cannon-like shooting arm, Dick was considered a star in water polo, but he elected to pursue footy.\n\nGiven all the other dual international Olympians played a variety of rugby at the Games, Thornett\u2019s feat of representing Australia in a third and entirely different sport stands him apart. The only man to come close to joining him is Michael Cleary, who won a bronze medal in the 100m sprint at the Commonwealth Games in Perth in 1962, between his stints as a Wallaby and a future Kangaroo winger. Mark Nawaqanitawase \u201cMarky Mark\u201d played his first game for NSW in rugby union in 2020 and went on to debut for the Wallabies in 2022. With his Fjiian heritage, Nawaqanitawase was also in demand as a sevens rugby player, and he played for Australia at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Mark Nawaqanitawase has been a revelation for the Roosters. Credit: Getty Images After playing at the 2023 Rugby World Cup for the Wallabies and then revealing he would be switching to the NRL in 2025, Nawaqanitawase was selected to play for the Australian sevens team at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. The team came fourth.\n\nAnd some others Having first represented New Zealand in rugby league in 2004, and then for the All Blacks in rugby (where he won two World Cups), Sonny Bill Williams set his sights on making the New Zealand sevens Olympic team in 2016 in Rio. SBW made the team and became an Olympian, but ruptured his achilles tendon in one of the pool games. Former Parramatta Eels winger Semi Radradra played for the Kangaroos in 2016, and then represented his native Fiji in rugby from 2018 after switching back to rugby. In 2021, he joined the Fijian sevens team and played at the Tokyo Olympics, where he helped Fiji defend their 2016 gold medal.

Danilo P\u00e9rez saved his confession until the end of his solo show at the Melbourne International Jazz Festival, telling us how nervous he\u2019d been before the concert. P\u00e9rez may be one of the most respected and experienced artists in contemporary jazz, having spent decades touring the world with his bands (and those of legends such as Wayne Shorter and Dizzy Gillespie), but he rarely performs solo. Danilo P\u00e9rez performs at the Melbourne Recital Centre during the Melbourne International Jazz Festival. Credit: Duncographic This was a unique opportunity for the Panamanian pianist-composer to give free rein to his creative impulses \u2013 and for us to witness the unfurling of that creativity in real time. Throughout his generous set, it was clear that P\u00e9rez was letting his curiosity lead the music wherever it wanted. His prodigious technical facility gave his right and left hands complete independence, allowing him to simultaneously fashion and explore melodic themes, contrapuntal lines, chord progressions and rhythmic concepts.\n\nEach piece brimmed with dazzling variations and a constant sense of discovery \u2013 an approach which made the music feel almost three-dimensional, as if P\u00e9rez were uncovering different facets of a precious stone that sparkled and turned in his mind\u2019s eye. Loading Most of the compositions were his own, interspersed with some inventive treatments of pop tunes and an improvisation on Waltzing Matilda that began as a playful parody (complete with kooky effects from P\u00e9rez\u2019s digital keyboard) before morphing into an unexpectedly tender ode. A standing ovation prompted two superb encores: an ingenious medley of Monk tunes and a gorgeous ballad with a title that summed up the audience\u2019s enthralled response: Gratitude. Later that evening, a quintet of Melbourne musicians paid tribute to a giant of Australian jazz: the late drummer Allan Browne. Browne was a dedicated mentor as well as a hugely influential musician, and the performers (Andrea Keller, Eugene Ball, Phil Noy, Nick Haywood and Dave Beck) spoke of the profound impact Browne had on them.\n\nTogether, they revisited tunes they\u2019d recorded and performed with Browne over the years, featuring arrangements that were as multi-faceted as Browne himself. There were passages of graceful lyricism, poetic angularity, surreal abstraction and profound sorrow leavened by beauty. Each piece was suffused with the players\u2019 affection and deep respect for Browne and his legacy, making this a truly heartfelt homage. Adam Manning performing in First Rhythms. Credit: Will Hamilton Coates On Sunday, percussionist and Kamilaroi artist Adam Manning (First Nations artist-in-residence at the festival) presented a new commissioned work, First Rhythms. Performing alongside members of the Australian Art Orchestra, Manning was clearly moved by the empathy and sensitivity of the AAO musicians he had worked with over the past year to create this meditative work. Clapsticks served as the beating heart of First Rhythms, but in Manning\u2019s hands their pulse was organic and unpredictable, as in nature. Quivering string instruments conjured buzzing insects or the shimmer of a desert mirage; rolling drums evoked ocean waves or clouds in a turbulent sky. In the exquisite final movement, Manning sat cross-legged on the floor and leant forward as if listening to Mother Earth, echoing her subtle vibrations with his clapsticks and gently inviting us to connect with Country, ourselves and one another.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas\n\nThe Melbourne International Jazz Festival continues until Sunday, October 26\n\nNOTE: No star rating has been applied\n\nTHEATRE\n\nMidland Highway Revisited \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Motley Bauhaus, until October 25 Indie performance in Melbourne is going through a rough patch, with La Mama Theatre dark all year, and The Butterfly Club, a much-loved cabaret venue in the CBD, closing suddenly in July. The Motley Bauhaus in Carlton has picked up some of the slack, and it\u2019s worthing checking out the talent there. Midland Highway Revisited at the Motley Bauhaus Following hot on the heels of its vibrant Fringe program comes an eerie comic cabaret from central Victoria that will appeal to fans of Oz gothic, history buffs, and lovers of local country and folk music. Midland Highway Revisited: An Investigative Musical from A Haunted House isn\u2019t really a musical. It\u2019s more like a fascinating live podcast, with songs.\n\nTwins Liz and Sarah (from indie folk band Taylor Project) undertake a forensic examination of whether their house in Elmore, near Bendigo, is haunted. It\u2019s soon clear these musical ghostbusters will have their hands full. As one of them notes: \u201cHaunting can just mean paying attention to things.\u201d And boy, do they pay attention, with a nerdy hyperfocus on hyperlocal history. Loading Starting with acknowledgement of Aboriginal sovereignty, the depredations of colonialism and the Victorian gold rushes (the traditional owners of the land, the Dja Dja Wurrung, call the area \u201cupside down country\u201d due to the amount of gold mining), the artists suss out the history of their own home. There\u2019s a lot to uncover. The house had a former life as an RSL club. When they bought it, they found a dilapidated guitar with a love message from the 1990s carved onto the back \u2026 and dutifully track down the story behind it. A lonely widow. Lightning strikes. Eccentric local musos. Disturbing dreams and whiskers in the walls. Waves of economic recession that left a ghost town and a cemetery in the middle of nowhere. Songs composed by the dead.\n\nPersonal (and genealogical) anecdote is woven throughout, and the yarning is delivered with comic charm and engrossing attention to detail. These artists are all about the research and press nerd buttons with infectious enthusiasm. Songs rove from satirical ditties to plangent local country numbers, such as Pissin\u2019 Down in Colbo, and the musical haunting includes a Bob Dylan number from the seminal album Highway 61 Revisited. There are even more ghosts than the twins know. The phrase \u201cevery love story is a ghost story\u201d doesn\u2019t, in fact, first appear in David Foster Wallace, for instance, but in the diaries of Australian writer Christina Stead, still haunted by the death of her husband. That said, the show needs less not more. The wealth of material in this shaggy dog of a cabaret could use a director or a dramaturg to tidy things up a bit, and I hope it gets the attention it deserves. Reviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nOPERA\n\nKatya Kabanova \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nVictorian Opera, Palais Theatre, until October 16 Czech composer Leos Janacek suffered a long obsession with a four-decades-younger married woman. His passion was entirely unrequited, but music lovers got incalculable benefits, as Kamila Stosslova inspired a string of compositions, including Katya Kabanova \u2013 one of the great but rarely performed operas of the 20th century. Desiree Frahn and Andrew Goodwin in a scene from Katya Kabanova. Credit: Jeff Busby It is the story of a young wife who endures a bullying mother-in-law and a weak husband under the thumb of his mother. Victorian Opera\u2019s production scored at every turn, with a splendid Australian cast, ingenious and creative production, and daring and clever use of live black and white video throughout on a full-stage screen. Not least was the Australian National Academy of Music orchestra\u2019s extraordinary playing, sensitively and effectively led by Alexander Briger (nephew of Charles Mackerras, one of the finest Janacek conductors).\n\nThe singers had to act superbly because they were near-constantly several times life-size on the screen. Soprano Desiree Frahn was simply stellar in every respect as Katya, while Antoinette Halloran as the malevolent mother looked as though she were born to the role (if that is, in fact, a compliment!), in a mesmeric presence. Emily Edmonds was a delightful Varvara and all the men were accomplished \u2013 especially Andrew Goodwin as Boris and Adrian Tamburini as Dikoj \u2013 although this opera is really a vehicle for the women. The staging was occasionally obscure \u2013 for example, there were sometimes up to six other silent Katyas on stage. I\u2019ve no idea what this signified \u2013 possibly the incoherent thoughts rushing through her brain as her mental state unravelled. Loading Director Heather Fairbairn was adventurous, courageous and persuasive. Credit too to set and costume designer Savanna Wegman and video designer Robert Brown, whose video, with two camera operators on stage, was mostly highly effective. Amusingly, when Katya was having sex offstage, the video briefly turned to colour. This Katya deserves five stars for its energy, originality and general excellence, not to mention Victorian Opera\u2019s vision in staging it.\n\nReviewed by Barney Zwartz\n\nDANCE\n\nThe Other Side of Me \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFairfax Studio, until October 19 Larrakia choreographer and teacher Gary Lang is a welcome addition to the DanceX festival. His NT Dance Company \u2013 known for its cross-over collaborations with companies such as West Australian Ballet \u2013 is not seen often enough in Melbourne. The Other Side of Me is well worth experiencing for its own sake. It\u2019s based on the true story of an Indigenous boy who was adopted when he was five and taken to England, where he had an obscure and troubled life. In a letter, he confessed to feeling torn between two selves \u2013 the one he knew and the one he left behind. The Other Side of Me explores the feeling of being torn between two selves. Credit: Paz Tassone Lang\u2019s piece explores the emotional dimensions of this divided self \u2013 the melancholy, the rage and finally a fragile sense of the possibility of reunion. It suggests the desire for a return, not necessarily to a geographical place, but to a deeper sense of belonging.\n\nIt\u2019s performed by two dancers, Alexander Abbot and Chandler Connell, who embody the young man\u2019s twin souls. Early scenes evoke restraint \u2013 bodies and gestures held back. Projected images of weathered natural forms, shells and skeletal leaves, extend this mood: damaged, suspended, touched by grief. Then comes violence. The spirit turns upon itself. There\u2019s real intensity here, collisions and counterforces, a kind of self-wrestling. The blows are powerful but loose: the youth is ungrounded, fighting to locate himself in his own body. The work is very open and might resonate with anyone displaced or divided between worlds. It paints in moods rather than concrete images or situations, and at times it feels a little slippery, fleeting in its description of emotional states. The Other Side of Me is well worth experiencing. Credit: Paz Tassone Nonetheless, the finale is satisfying. The projected images are more specific: forests, rugged coastlines, a place that feels out of reach. And the two dancers, both robust but articulate movers, bring it home as a more ritualised vocabulary is asserted.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nDANCE\n\nDanceX festival week 2 \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nPlayhouse, until October 19 Stephanie Lake\u2019s Auto Cannibal is an apt work to open the second week of Dance X because its concept \u2013 recycling fragments of earlier work \u2014 echoes the festival\u2019s own logic of revival and renewal. Lake\u2019s choreography turns self-quotation into an aesthetic argument: old material takes on fresh meaning when performed in a changed context. Auto Cannibal by Stephanie Lake. Credit: Jade Ellis Now more than five years old, it was first created for a cross-cultural collaboration between companies in Beijing and Brisbane. Here, it is restaged for Melbourne-based dancers with connections to Lake\u2019s other projects. The ensemble includes many distinctive presences \u2013 big dance personalities, bold movers \u2013 which gives the work a somewhat eclectic vibe. It\u2019s full of large gestures with a bright communal energy: a very different sensibility to her most recent commission for the Australian Ballet, Seven Days, which used exaggerated expressions and playful, clown-like movement seemingly influenced by the company\u2019s recent engagement with contemporary European dance.",

Then it was recalled\n\nLung cancer patients who were vaccinated in the first 100 days of treatment were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years later than those who didn't receive a shot, while melanoma patients experienced significantly longer median survival times if they had received a shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Surprisingly, patients with tumours that don\u2019t typically respond well to immunotherapy also saw very strong benefits, with nearly fivefold improvement in three-year overall survival,\" the report's authors wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers said they were preparing to test the treatment strategy with a nationwide clinical trial in people with lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\"This study will tell us whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccines should be included as part of the standard of care for patients receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor,\" MD Anderson Cancer Center researcher and study author Adam Grippin wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, we hope that this approach will help many patients who are treated with immune therapy, and especially those who currently lack effective treatment options.\"\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, is found in every cell, containing genetic instructions to create proteins. Scientists believe it can be used to train immune cells to spot patients' tumours.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy immune systems can kill cancer cells before they become a threat, but some cancer cells adapt themselves in order to camouflage warning signs to immune systems. Cancer treatments called \"checkpoint inhibitors\" work to undermine that camouflage. But this treatment doesn't always work.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists around the world have been devising ways to use mRNA to train immune cells to spot tumours, but the US scientists wondered whether a generic mRNA could help checkpoint inhibitor treatment to work better.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the BASE mRNA facility at The University of Queensland is dedicated to researching mRNA cancer vaccines.\n\n\n\nDeputy director of the BASE, associate professor Seth Cheetham, who was not involved in the US research, said that \"while very promising\" a key limitation of the data was that it was retrospective, \"which demonstrates association, not proof.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Despite lining up with laboratory models and experiments from patient blood, a gold-standard randomised controlled trial is required to definitively prove that mRNA COVID vaccines are effective in cancer treatment,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever Cheetham said if the confirmatory trials are successful: \"doctors may soon have an unexpected powerful new option for treating cancer\".\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied / Chloe Holt \"[Chris's cancer specialists] confirmed that his skin is still extremely vulnerable and won't fully heal for about three years after radiotherapy \u2014 so this was the worst possible time for him to be left unprotected.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHolt says the couple, who are based in the UK, once considered Australian sunscreens to be the \"gold standard\", but they've now lost trust in them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're always talked about as the gold standard, but this experience has completely changed that for me,\" she says.\n\n\n\nIt's completely shaken that trust and confidence \u2014 in all SPFs, to be perfectly honest.\n\nTGA regulations 'potentially outdated'\n\nIn June, an investigation by consumer advocacy group Choice found 16 of 20 products from a range of popular sunscreen brands failed to meet their advertised SPF ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\nUltra Violette's Lean Screen was one of them \u2014 returning the lowest SPF level of 4. After the company conducted its own testing, returning SPF results ranging from 4 to 64, the product was voluntarily recalled.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the findings, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) placed more than 20 sunscreen products \u2014 primarily physical sunscreens with the same base formulations \u2014 under review due to concerns they didn't meet their advertised SPF rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, 21 sunscreens have been either recalled or had sales paused in Australia, all of which are linked to a manufacturer called Wild Child Laboratories in Perth.\n\n\n\nOver 20 sunscreens have been either recalled or had sales paused in Australia, all of which are linked to a manufacturer called Wild Child Laboratories in Perth. Source: SBS News There's a reason why so many sunscreens have been caught up in so-called Sunscreen Gate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, sunscreen brands don't actually make their own sunscreen. That's done by accredited manufacturers, such as Wild Child Laboratories. Those labs then use external testing facilities to validate their SPF ratings. Brands will then take a base formulation, add small tweaks (such as fragrance) and then slap their label on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TGA's ongoing investigation found no manufacturing issues that could explain the variability in SPF testing results; instead saying it had \"significant concerns\" about the reliability of the testing facility used by Wild Child \u2014 Princeton Consumer Research Corp, a global research company headquartered in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nDermatologist Dr Cara McDonald says Choice's findings aren't \"surprising\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The regulatory systems in Australia, although they're quite strict, they are potentially a little outdated and they're not necessarily reviewed and updated regularly,\" McDonald says.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that there's a \"lack of transparency\", especially in the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most Australians don't realise that all these brands we're buying, they're not making their own sunscreen, they're actually just buying in a base,\" she says.\n\n\n\nDermatologist Dr Cara McDonald isn't surprised by Choice's findings. She says they're a sign that Australia's regulatory standards might not be the \"gold standard\". Source: Supplied / Dr Cara McDonald\n\nHow SPF ratings are given\n\nTo sell a sunscreen product in Australia, brands must comply with strict TGA standards, which encompass SPF testing and broad-spectrum UVA testing, water resistance, and stability under various conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there are also limitations in testing techniques that even the TGA has recognised.\n\n\n\n\n\nSPF ratings are determined through testing on humans (termed 'in vivo'). The process only measures UVB rays \u2014 the ones that cause sunburn \u2014 by monitoring how quickly skin starts to redden. Internationally, it's recognised \u2014 including by the TGA \u2014 that the testing is less reliable and comes with known variabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deeper penetrating and more dangerous UVA rays (synonymous with long-term skin damage and skin cancer) can only be tested in a lab ('in vitro'), which is considered to be a much more efficient and reliable method.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the TGA mandates both UVA and UVB testing, McDonald says there is \"ongoing work\" to develop UVB testing methods in labs, thereby increasing the accuracy of results. But it's still not mandated.\n\n\n\nA TGA spokesperson told SBS News that its regulation is \"open and transparent\" and that it is \"currently considering\" the implementation of new in vitro testing, acknowledging its reliability and \"significant advantages\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson also said the regulator is \"investigating the viability of the TGA conducting in-house in vitro sunscreen testing\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The TGA regularly reviews our legislation and policy to ensure they remain fit for purpose. If we consider that changes may be warranted, this is proposed and managed through a transparent consultative process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor McDonald, Choice's findings and the subsequent recalls are proof that Australia's sunscreen regulations might not be as reliable as many thought they were.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got this 'gold standard' label, not because the sunscreens are gold standard, but because everyone thought that this strict regulation that we have must mean our sunscreens are at least doing what they say they're doing,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is where it's completely just ripped the floor out from underneath that.\"\n\n\n\nAfter over 20 sunscreens were pulled from shelves, those in high-risk communities have been left with \"sunscreen anxiety\", not knowing what products to trust. Source: Getty / Gallo Images\n\n'I had full faith'\n\nFor 35-year-old New Zealander Jess (who requested SBS News omit her surname), the realisation that the sunscreen she was using might not have been adequately protecting her was a hard pill to swallow.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter having a basal cell carcinoma \u2014 a type of skin cancer \u2014 cut out of her face at 29, she says she was \"fastidious\" with sunscreen use as she was at a higher risk of developing other skin cancers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Holt's husband, she was also using Ultra Violette's Lean Screen.\n\n\n\nIt does make me feel quite anxious thinking about those two years I've used that sunscreen \u2014 and what the outcome of that will be for me. Jess\n\nWhile she says she's always used extra protective layers, including hats, long sleeves and sunglasses, she still wonders whether her SPF was as protective as she believed it to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those two years where I thought I was protected: was I protected at all? I think about the damage that potentially happened in that time and it makes me feel a bit unwell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just had full faith in it because I knew how much I was applying and reapplying.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, a spokesperson for Ultra Violette said: \"As a brand, we have always taken our responsibility to prioritise safety, protection and skin health above all else. That's why despite some tests that showed Lean Screen had moderate to high levels of SPF effectiveness we made the decision to recall the product in August.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are supportive of the TGA\u2019s acknowledgement and move towards newer, more ethical testing methods. Ultra Violette has and will continue to, work directly with the TGA and through industry bodies like ACCORD to agitate for positive change and greater confidence in SPF claims.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson also noted that the company was the first and \"currently the only of the 16 products that failed Choice's test\" to withdraw its product from the market and that it had voluntarily shared its formula with the TGA.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral brands flagged in the study \u2014 including Banana Boat, Bondi Sands, and Cancer Council \u2014 said they retested their sunscreens following the investigation and found they matched the SPF 50+ claims.\n\n\n\nThe company has also offered customers refunds on its Lean Screen product.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Jess says potential consequences are \"worth a lot more than what a $50 tube of SPF is worth\", she also acknowledged the brand has been \"copping a lot of heat\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a long list of SPFs from different companies that were not meeting the threshold and I'm seeing less criticism of them,\" she says.\n\n\n\n'We don't need to panic'\n\nMcDonald says that while Choice's findings may be a sign that Australia's regulations have fallen behind, they also sound more alarming than they actually are.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SPF rating of 30 is estimated to filter out 96.7 per cent of UVB radiation, while SPF 50 is estimated to filter out 98 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TGA spokesperson added: \"The difference in the amount of sun protection between an SPF of 25, 30 and 50 is relatively small, and all offer meaningful protection when used as part of a broader sun safety strategy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo even if a sunscreen product has scored lower than its advertised rating claims, chances are customers are still getting pretty good coverage if they apply and reapply often, McDonald says.\n\n\n\nThe difference in the amount of sun protection between an SPF of 25, 30 and 50 is relatively small. Therapeutic Goods Administration\n\nThe problem is: most people don't.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the Cancer Council found that only half of Australians are using three or more forms of sun protection (such as hat, sunglasses and long clothing) during peak UV times. Only two in five Australians use sunscreen on most days during late spring and summer, when daily sunscreen use is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nFull coverage for an adult body will require about seven teaspoons of sunscreen every two hours, or more often after swimming or sweating \u2014 a lofty goal even for the most sun-conscious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even though we don't need to panic about SPF20 versus 50, so to speak, we do need to realise that we're probably starting at a much lower SPF level than we think,\" McDonald says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[We] may end up more likely to get burnt and more likely to get UVA damage, which is going to cause pigmentation, ageing, inflammation and increase our risk of skin cancer without burning us.\"\n\n\n\nAustralian lupus community 'beyond anxious'\n\nAngie Knaggs isn't sure if she can trust her sunscreen either.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 42-year-old has lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the body's healthy tissues.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says 'SunscreenGate' has \"deeply affected\" those in the Australian lupus community, as the disease causes sensitivity to sunlight and UV radiation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins Lupus Center in the US, sun exposure can cause sunburn-like reactions, skin rashes, and flares in other parts of the body. Lupus also increases the risk of skin cancer from UV radiation.\n\n\n\nAngie Knaggs says she and the lupus community are \"beyond anxious\" about the recalls and left wondering whether their sun protection has been adequate. Source: Supplied / Dr Angie Knaggs Additionally, many medications that treat lupus can cause additional sun sensitivity, Knaggs says. This means that skin checks every six months, wearing Ultraviolet Protective Factor (UPF) clothing, and carrying an umbrella on sunny days are all pretty standard fare.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after using two products being reviewed by the TGA \u2014 Lean Screen and Naked Sundays Collagen Glow Mineral \u2014 she's now been advised by medical experts to go for a skin check every three months, \"as the risk of skin cancer lesions has increased\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The entire community is beyond anxious \u2014 most are heading in for deep skin cancer checks and are left wondering what long-term damage these products have actually caused us,\" Knaggs says.\n\n\n\nI'm extremely anxious about what this has caused long-term to my organs. Dr Angie Knaggs\n\nNaked Sundays' product was not included in the Choice investigation, but shares the same base formulation as Lean Screen. Preliminary testing of the base formulation by the TGA estimates that the formulation is unlikely to have an SPF greater than 21, and may be as low as 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a message sent to Knaggs in August, a Naked Sundays representative said there was \"no risk [of] any damage \u2014 the product still adheres to current TGA guidelines\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement provided to SBS News, Naked Sundays and its stockist MECCA said the companies had jointly \"chosen\" to remove the product from sale, \"while Naked Sundays awaits independent re-testing results\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not a recall; this is a proactive step that we have taken in partnership with Naked Sundays,\" the statement read.\n\n\n\nPhysical sunscreens scored worst, but only option for some\n\nMost of the sunscreens placed under review by the TGA are physical sunscreens (also known as zinc or mineral).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Choice investigation, physical zinc (or mineral) sunscreens overall performed more poorly compared to chemical sunscreens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were some chemical sunscreens in the lower group as well, but the majority of the poorly performing sunscreens are physical sunscreens,\" McDonald says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile chemical sunscreens absorb into the skin and \"sponge\" up any UV, physical sunscreens act like a layer of film.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald says there are plenty of drawbacks to physical sunscreens: They're more likely to be rubbed off, they aren't as stable as chemical sunscreens, and brands will often need to modify base formulas to offset their thickness and white cast (residue).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TGA says that alterations to the base formulation \"could increase or decrease the SPF of a sunscreen\".\n\n\n\nOverall, physical sunscreens performed more poorly in Choice's investigation of the SPF rating of 20 popular products. Source: SBS News But for some consumers, physical sunscreens are the only option they have.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News spoke to a 30-year-old from Victoria, who asked to remain anonymous, who is allergic to the chemical butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDM) found in many sunscreens.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says her allergy has made it \"hard\" for her to access many sunscreens and that she was using the Naked Sundays product. Now the findings \u2014 and an inaccessible market \u2014 have put her in a \"tight spot\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm forced to turn to mineral-based products,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, now it's hard to tell which ones are actually effective products or real sunscreens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother 30-year-old Sydneysider told SBS News they were \"horrified\" after seeing that two products they had used in the past \u2014 Ultra Violette's Lean Screen and Naked Sundays' Collagen Glow Mineral \u2014 were pulled from shelves.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she's now experiencing \"sunscreen anxiety\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have lost confidence in my skin protection,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Right now, I don't trust the sunscreen in Australia.\"\n\n\n\nA 'wake-up call' to the TGA\n\nProfessor Mark Morgan, a professor of general practice at Bond University and chair of The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' (RACGP) expert committee, says it's understandable that some consumers are feeling anxious following the recalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's understandably worrying to people who have been using these sunscreens and imagining that it's been more protective than it has been in reality,\" Morgan says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia has a very high rate of skin cancer and people need to be able to rely on the sunscreen products that they use to help protect themselves from the harmful effects of the sun.\"\n\n\n\nIt's understandably worrying to people who have been using these sunscreens. Professor Mark Morgan, Bond University\n\nHe's calling on the TGA to release a \"trust list of verified sunscreens\" as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really important that we have a reliable use of sunscreen and that we know which ones work and which ones to buy,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TGA spokesperson said \"There are over 950 sunscreens currently included in the ARTG [Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods], which is a publicly available searchable database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Consumers can tell if sunscreens are included in the ARTG by looking for the \u2018AUST L\u2019 number on the product\u2019s label.\"\n\n\n\nMorgan cautions against losing faith in the TGA, saying: \"I think we can trust the TGA, but it's been an important wake-up call where there are gaps in the TGA's processes or in its ability to monitor the safety of health products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald also hopes for a total review by the federal regulator: \"Hopefully in the near future, we're going to see TGA do a review of all the sunscreens and all these brands will get retested.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's also seen more anxiety about which products to pick and brands to trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things I've heard most is the concern regarding the Cancer Council sunscreens and people feeling so let down and disappointed by their results,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the four Cancer Council sunscreens tested by Choice, just one matched its SPF50+ claims \u2014 Cancer Council Kids Sunscreen 50+. Others returned SPF ratings of 24, 27 and 33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People saw that as the epitome of sunscreen. It's the Cancer Council \u2014 their job is to protect us from cancer,\" McDonald says.\n\n\n\nOne of the things I've heard most is the concern regarding the Cancer Council sunscreens and people feeling so let down and disappointed by their results. Dr Cara McDonald\n\nA Cancer Council spokesperson told SBS News that the TGA decision to recall sunscreens demonstrates \"strong and robust sunscreen regulation, vital for maintaining consumer trust and confidence in sunscreens\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We understand that the CHOICE investigation and updates from the TGA will have caused some concern, particularly for Australians who are at higher risk of skin cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All Cancer Council products named in the CHOICE report were retested, and these test results have been provided to the TGA. Based on those results, the regulator confirmed there is no safety concern with our sunscreens and no reason to withdraw any products at this time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Knaggs's trust in the TGA hasn't been hindered, she's still left with simmering anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's been an excellent wake-up call that we cannot rely on sunscreen and hats alone. \"There's a total distrust [in physical sunscreens],\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The question we sit with now is \u2014 what sunscreen is safe?\"\n\n\n\n",

It toppled Canberra, which is now the country's third most expensive capital for houses with a median price of $1,100,392.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Adelaide, Darwin, Brisbane and Perth, unit price growth outpaced that of houses, which Domain said indicated first home buyers and investors were set on seeking value and affordability in a tightening market.\n\n\n\nJumps for Brisbane, Sydney\n\nBrisbane property prices have soared, with houses in coastal suburbs like Birkdale and Lota rising more than 25 per cent annually to top $1 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increase in demand is also reflected in housing price growth across Queensland's regional local government areas \u2014 property prices in the Central Highlands have increased 33.3 per cent over 5 years, while those in Hinchinbrook on the Cassowary Coast have shot up nearly 50 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the image below change to see where house prices have grown across different states and territories.\n\n\n\nHouse prices have increased significantly across Australia's capital cities, as per the latest house price report from Domain. Source: SBS News Nicola Powell, chief of research and economics at Domain, said the figures showed a shift in the parameters of \"affordability\" \u2014 markets like Brisbane and Perth that were once more attractive for first-home buyers are now ranked among Australia's highest median home prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Affordability has been reshaped. We used to look at markets like Brisbane as more affordable and we've now seen a change in price hierarchy,\" Powell told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Borrowing capacity is slowly diminished in the face of rising property prices, and for first home buyers, it becomes quite challenging.\"\n\n\n\nBut pointing to Melbourne, Powell said it was an example of one of the cities where value was still achievable for first home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We could see some shifting behaviours there, particularly for new migrants who usually land in Sydney, I think for those first home buyers, Melbourne will start to become more appealing,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit prices in Brisbane increased 4.2 per cent over the quarter, making the median price of more than $700,000, the second-highest in Australia, surpassing Melbourne at nearly $600,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the image below change to see where unit prices have grown across different states and territories.\n\n\n\nUnit price growth is outpacing house price growth in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin, according to the latest Domain house price report. Source: SBS News Sydney has long been Australia's most expensive city to live in, but over the past quarter, median house prices climbed to previously unseen heights.\n\n\n\n\n\nCammeray in North Sydney topped the charts for suburb price growth, with its median house price jumping 29 per cent to $3.4 million. Lidcombe, Mount Pritchard and Bankstown all climbed into the millions with an annual increase of more than 21 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor units in Sydney, the suburb with the largest property price growth was Darling Point, with a median average price of nearly $3 million, followed by Balgowlah in Manly at $1.3 million and Stanmore in the city's inner-west at $955,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney's lowest median house price was found in Werrington, at just under $800,000, and its cheapest units were in Mount Druitt, Cabramatta, Fairfield and Warwick Farm, with a median value of around $440,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest median house prices in Sydney were in Vaucluse, at $7.8 million, Bronte at $6 million and Mosman at $5.3 million. While high, property prices in these suburbs have seen limited growth over the years.\n\n\n\nMelbourne house prices climbing\n\nMelbourne's median house price increased 2.2 per cent to $1.08 million \u2014 its strongest quarterly gain in nearly four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some traditionally expensive suburbs like inner-city Carlton, coastal Sorrento and Windsor in the inner-south revealed an \"improved affordability\" \u2014 or, a drop in price \u2014 the average median property price in suburban localities like Heidelberg and Box Hill witnessed steep inclines into the millions, an annual rise of 25.9 per cent and 20.7 per cent respectively.\n\n\n\nThe report shows house prices across Australia are increasing steadily in spite of cost of living pressures, supporting recent figures from analytics provider Cotality that revealed 30 per cent of homes sold in the past 12 months went for $1 million or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nCotality economist Kaytlin Ezzy said national dwelling prices were up 46.8 per cent, spelling concerns for first-home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A household on the average income of $106,000 with a 20 per cent deposit would need to dedicate more than 50 per cent of their pre-tax earnings to service a loan on a million-dollar property,\" she told the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter strong housing market gains over the last 12 months, 195 suburbs across Australia leapt into the million-dollar median range.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn that period, 38 Brisbane suburbs recorded a median price jump into the millions, bringing the city's total number of seven-figure value markets to 205.\n\n\n\nPowell said the surging prices were being driven by a combination of factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Three RBA [Reserve Bank of Australia] rate cuts this year, rising consumer confidence, low levels of supply, and the strongest auction clearance rates in over two years are driving house and unit price growth across Australia's capitals,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the Australian government's 5 per cent home guarantee [scheme] now underway, we expect this momentum to accelerate further into the final quarter of the year, supporting both houses and units as buyers chase better value in a competitive market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Powell told SBS News the biggest changes were driven by improved borrowing power pushed by a rise in incomes and a \"fairly tight\" jobs market, all contributing to increased consumer sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you see a higher sentiment, it does play out well for a lot of markets,\" she said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Gold prices have soared this year, driven by a confluence of factors, including economic uncertainty and retail investors flocking to the yellow metal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat long rally experienced its first big fall overnight, dropping by around 8 per cent from Monday\u2019s peak of almost US$4,400 ($6,768) an ounce to a little above US$4,000 ($6,153), its biggest single-day decline in some 12 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas it the bubble bursting \u2014 or simply an overdue correction to an \"overbought\" commodity?\n\n\n\nWhat caused the gold surge \u2014 and its sharp fall?\n\nGold has had a blockbuster run this year \u2014 its best performance since 1979 \u2014 climbing by more than 50 per cent since the start of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's come amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty, particularly in the US, all spurring demand for the precious metal, traditionally considered a \"safe haven\" asset.\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral banks around the world have built stockpiles of gold in efforts to diversify their assets and reduce their reliance on the US dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a particularly sharp rise in the past two months, with the price of gold soaring by around US$1,000 per ounce.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Investor warning about FOMO as gold stocks tumble SBS News 14:42 English\n\nTony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, said the primary driver of gold's dramatic rise has been a \"very strong impulse\" to buy among retail investors due to a \"fear of missing out\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's one of those momentum trades where it's in the news, people are hearing about it, they\u2019re talking about it,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nSycamore said in his 30 years of observing the markets, he'd never seen anything like this before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a real panic move, and it concerns me because I don't think people really understand what the driver is, other than they\u2019re seeing people doing it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said that while people had pointed to the US dollar and fiscal deficit for the surge, the US dollar had been broadly stable over the past three months: the time gold has experienced its most rapid rise.\n\n\n\nCameron Gleeson, the senior investment strategist at Beta shares, told SBS\u2019 On the Money podcast that investors in gold were \"overweight\", and decided to \"take money off the table\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We reached a level where enough investors decided that that was the case to trim positions given how large those allocations have got within their portfolios, and as a result we see a slight retracement overall,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Poole, the global chief investment officer at Oriania Private Wealth, told SBS News earlier this month that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had been significantly pushing demand for gold up in recent months.\n\n\n\n\n\nETFs are funds that own a group of assets like stocks or bonds and are bought and sold like individual shares on stock markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You are seeing this huge financialisation of gold bullion through ETFs and retail investors racing out to buy after the market's already up 70 per cent,\" Poole said. \"I think that's been the big story over this year and particularly the last month.\"\n\n\n\nAnalysts say a \"fear of missing out\" among retail investors is one of the primary drivers of gold's sharp price increase. Source: Getty / Brendon Thorne/Bloomberg Sycamore said there had also been \"stretched\" positioning among those in the hedge fund community who invest based on momentum and trends, and had been buying gold on top of the retail and institutional investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everybody's gone to one side of the boat, and when everyone goes to one side of the boat, it generally tips back the other way. And that's what we've seen over the past 24 hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has also been a general volatility in the market of late, with similar sell-offs in cryptocurrency and regional banks earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nSycamore said that, together, an almost \"perfect storm\" had formed to create the conditions leading to the snapback.\n\n\n\nAfter the gold rush: what happens next?\n\nDespite gold\u2019s abrupt drop, it\u2019s important to frame the overnight plunge against the backdrop of its rise, including its US$1,000 climb over the past couple of months.\n\n\n\n\n\nSycamore said his sense was \u201cthe boat does stabilise\u201d, as there were still good \u201cmedium-term\u201d reasons to buy gold, but the question remained whether it would stabilise above US$4,000 or go lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPrice movements in markets aren\u2019t linear; they don\u2019t just move in one direction. We get these aggressive moves higher, followed by a snapback like we've seen. And the trend still continues in the medium term,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's been a snapback. Whether it's finished, we don't know the answer to that yet. But even if it does continue below US$4,000, then you'd probably have to imagine that we're going to probably find good buyers back where gold was trading two months ago, at US$3,500.\"\n\n\n\nAs it is, there are already signs of recovery. On Wednesday, gold rebounded to US$4,145 an ounce.\n\n\n\n\n\nGleeson said gold\u2019s fall has definitely been significant, but that it won\u2019t continue to dive majorly long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A magnitude of that fall [around 6 per cent] for an asset class like gold is very substantial. We're not talking about cryptocurrency like Bitcoin here. People rely on gold as a store of value and that can be unsettling when you see that store of value fall away in price like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Perhaps investors got a little bit ahead of themselves in the last month, that strong rally that we have seen through September and October. But over the long run, those drivers in the uncertainty that is in the world today still remains. And so we think investors will continue to invest over the long term in gold and gold ETFs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGold's pull-back said little about its fundamental price strength, but likewise neither had the last five per cent surge to new highs, Capital.com market analyst Kyle Rodda said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The underlying story for gold remains strong and is likely to remain well supported by expectations of US rate cuts, fiscal profligacy around the world and geopolitical risks,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It appears time for the gold market to normalise and gold prices to consolidate, albeit probably with some whipsawing price action in coming days,\" Rodda said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Reuters news agency and the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

[Telco regulator] ACMA must not conduct this \u2013 they are a part of the system that has failed Australians,\u201d Bennett told this masthead.\n\n\u201cThere are also serious questions about ACMA\u2019s competence, following revelations at Senate estimates last week that ACMA had concerns with the accuracy of Optus\u2019s initial reports regarding the outage to Triple Zero but failed to confirm the accuracy of the information with Optus for more than 24 hours after they were advised.\u201d\n\nThe comments come after Telstra reported a Triple Zero issue affecting up to 70 old Samsung models.

    "text": "Speaking at the summit, Bracks pivoted, saying that the future of Melbourne\u2019s growth now lies in its western suburbs. \u201cSunshine can be the Parramatta [Sydney\u2019s second CBD] of Melbourne \u2026 the west has changed. It\u2019s grown enormously.\u201d With major road links, a planned train \u201csuperhub\u201d and a future direct rail link to Melbourne Airport, Bracks said that Sunshine was filled with promise. \u201c[The west] will become the hub, the centre \u2026 it is the centre of what is happening around Melbourne, but also around Victoria. That\u2019s its future. And it\u2019s going to be so fantastic,\u201d Bracks said.\n\nThe population of Melbourne\u2019s west is predicted to almost double to 1.8 million by 2050, but demographer Simon Kuestenmacher believes the forecasts are an underestimate. He warns it\u2019s likely that the development of greenfield homes \u2013 which are cheaper to build than high-density housing and fit the \u201cAustralian dream\u201d of a quarter-acre block with a backyard \u2013 will grow faster than expected. \u201cThe infrastructure backlog, that\u2019s getting more intense. So we need much more infrastructure, and mostly what I\u2019m talking about here is connectivity. If we want to become a multi-modal city where we have job clusters \u2026 we need to make sure they\u2019re really well-connected. And if they\u2019re not, the whole system just doesn\u2019t work \u2026 We must spend heavily.\u201d Asked about increasing jobs in the west, Kuestenmacher said past Victorian government planning blueprints had promoted the creation of employment hubs across Melbourne, while simultaneously allowing the development of more office towers in the CBD and Docklands.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not smart because we now have empty B and C-grade offices in the CBD, it\u2019s a bit of a mess,\u201d he said. Loading Kuestenmacher said that as low-grade commercial buildings empty out, they could be replaced further out of the CBD. New jobs hubs, he said, were needed to create an identity to attract specific types of businesses. \u201cSecondary employment centres will eventually work as soon as they find a character or purpose. There\u2019s a lot of work ahead.\u201d Matt Carrick, secretary of the Department of Jobs, Skills, Industry and Regions, said much of the growth in jobs would come from small business operators in transport, logistics, professional services, science and construction.\n\n\u201cThe unsung story is the rise of small business \u2026 over the last five years, the top two municipalities in the country for small business growth are Wyndham and Melton. It\u2019s going to be a phenomenal advantage that will help balance things.\u201d In eight short years, the size of the western suburbs\u2019 professional workforce \u2013 those in fields including finance, insurance, sciences and IT \u2013 almost doubled, rising from about 70,000 to 130,000. \u201cThe associated positive is that professional roles typically employ highly educated people and pay above-average salaries. One downside \u2026 is that these roles tend not to be local,\u201d WoMEDA argues in its report. By last year, 47.9 per cent of western suburbs workers commuted outside the region for work, a figure that is projected to exceed 50 per cent within the next decade.\n\nAlready, workers in Wyndham, in the outer south-west, face an average morning commute time of 56 minutes. The alliance says Melbourne should follow the lead of Sydney and develop a second CBD in Sunshine, and two \u201csatellite cities\u201d in East Werribee and Cobblebank. Age senior city reporter Adam Carey (centre) moderates a panel at the West of Melbourne summit, with (from left) planning expert Peter Seamer, Melbourne University professor Beth Webster, Department of Jobs secretary Matt Carrick and western suburbs councils\u2019 chief executives Celia Haddock (Maribyrnong), Fiona Blair (Brimbank), Roslyn Wai (Melton) and Stephen Wall (Wyndham). Credit: Elke Meitzel \u201cThere are many parallels between the western regions of Australia\u2019s two largest metropolises. However, Greater Western Sydney is further into its journey than the west of Melbourne and is reaping the rewards,\u201d the report argues. It finds that the west of Melbourne and the west of Sydney share similar advantages and disadvantages. Both have a young, diverse and ambitious population, and are expected to absorb more population growth over the next two decades than other parts of the city.\n\nBoth also have higher-than-average unemployment and lower-than-average salary levels, as well as high levels of mortgage and rental stress. Loading In 2017, the Greater Sydney Commission released a 40-year plan to turn Sydney into a metropolis with three CBDs. Gabrielle Trainor previously led Infrastructure Australia and has been involved in developing Sydney\u2019s second CBD in Parramatta, and now, its third in Bradfield. On Wednesday night, Trainor told the summit that lessons from Sydney could be applied to Melbourne\u2019s west, including having a state minister for the region, a research facility and a dedicated infrastructure co-ordinator.",

    "text": "The classics are undeniable; the down to earth Not The Girl You Think You Are, the interstellar crackle of Distant Sun, the infectious joy of Chocolate Cake interlaced with Deee-Lite, Right Said Fred and The Turtles. They follow that madness with \u201ca slightly obscure song\u201d, Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over, an anthem of pity and pathos that had long cemented its place in the pop pantheon. Dispensing with the pretence of an encore, they delivered the one-two punch of Weather with You and Better be Home Soon for a finale. Crowded House outdid themselves. MUSIC\n\nDANIEL MULLER-SCHOTT PERFORMS TCHAIKOVSKY\n\nSydney Symphony Orchestra, Opera House, October 22\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tchaikovsky is justly renowned for bringing magical colour to child-like stories in his ballet-scores, while Stravinsky is often seen as the architect of Neoclassicism, which placed the musical gestures and forms of the past into new, sometimes incongruous settings.\n\nIn this program, the two giants of Russian music in their respective centuries changed places, Tchaikovsky toying affectionately with 18th century phrase structure in his Variations on a Rococo Theme, Opus 33 and Stravinsky vividly bringing a child\u2019s puppet to life in Petrushka. Cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott. Cellist Daniel Muller-Schott played Tchaikovsky\u2019s Variations with a smooth, wonderfully glowing mahogany sound, stylistic suavity and virtuosic ease. One problem for today\u2019s performers is that the cellist for whom Tchaikovsky wrote the work, Wilhelm Fitzenhagen, added changes Tchaikovsky disapproved, but which have become standard. They arguably push the piece more into a vehicle for technical display and away from Tchaikovsky\u2019s Arcadian view of the 18th century and create passages which might trespass into poor taste, at least from today\u2019s perspective on 18th century playing. In the theme and earlier variations, Muller-Schott\u2019s playing adopted impeccable elegant courtly manners which sat easily with a 19th century view of aristocratic propriety. It was in the slow sixth variation, just after the cadenza that Muller-Schott introduced a tone of expressive emotionalism where one glimpses Tchaikovsky\u2019s true feelings peeking out from behind the gallant mask.\n\nBy contrast in the second half conductor Lionel Bringuier led a sharply edged performance of Stravinsky\u2019s Petrushka (1946 version). The opening tableau was balanced into a picture of swirling chaotic excitement. Pianist Louisa Breen dispatched the difficult piano part with aplomb. The most memorable moments were the many solos from SSO players, where Stravinsky gives simple fairground-like tunes an unexpected piquancy or timbre, or jams them together in unrelated blends and keys in a small, wincing clash, like a tooth smarting sharply while eating an ice-cream. The concert began with another child\u2019s story, The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice by Paul Dukas, fixed immovably in the minds of a whole generation as Mickey Mouse in Disney\u2019s Fantasia. Bringuier did not rush the tempo, allowing the SSO players to bring out the delicacy of wind and string writing with polish and refinement. It also maintained a comic, deliberate character to the plodding broomstick whose transformation into an automaton unleashes such unmanageable chaos, giving a foretaste, no doubt, of our own adventures to come with AI. MUSICAL THEATRE\n\nCALAMITY JANE\n\nStudio, Sydney Opera House, October 19, until November 16\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Sometimes a show and a venue press each other\u2019s buttons in a way that makes each perspire just a little, and bundles of joy are instantly born in the form of smiles on people\u2019s faces. Calamity Jane and the Opera House\u2019s Studio are such a coupling. The room becomes the Golden Garter saloon in Deadwood, South Dakota, in the 1870s \u2013 a place where women are scarce and horses are skittish.\n\nWere some omniscient history of theatrical depictions of the fabled Jane penned, three would surely rise to the top like so many whiskey-laden burps: Doris Day in the 1953 movie, Robin Weigert in TV\u2019s superlative Deadwood and Virginia Gay in this ongoing production of the musical derived (in 1961) from the film. Virginia Gay in the title role of Calamity Jane. Credit: Daniel Boud I missed it at Hayes Theatre (where it was initially in Michelle Guthrie\u2019s Neglected Musicals series), at Belvoir, and in its gallops around Australia, so join the hoedown seven years late, but forever grateful finally to witness Gay giving the performance of a lifetime. The show\u2019s also a supreme example of Richard Carroll\u2019s art as director, including making the audience so many extras in the Golden Garter, and the way the production keeps poking itself in its own theatrical eye. The musical is basically the movie with a stagecoach full of extra songs, though Carroll tweaks the characters and story-telling, while musical director Nigel Ubrihien slims the orchestral score down to just piano (plus the cast playing a bunch of stringed instruments for The Black Hills of Dakota). They found no solution to saving the saccharine Love You Dearly, however. Gay is a force field of charismatic energy as Jane, roaming the stage and audience, looking for trouble, confused about what her heart\u2019s telling her, and discovering her \u201cfemale\u201d side with all the wonder and suspicion of a child being given a shiny new bicycle. When she sings the show\u2019s famed Secret Love, she doesn\u2019t compete with Doris Day\u2019s pristine sweetness, but rips the song apart, and, in the process, performs some amateur cardiovascular surgery on us, too. Gay\u2019s Jane is almost a female Falstaff in her scope.\n\nLike Carroll, choreographer Cameron Mitchell, designer Lauren Peters and lighting designer Trent Suidgeest give the cast a handful of aces with which to play. While Andrew Cutcliffe may not have the strongest singing voice, his idiosyncratic Wild Bill Hickok is a worthy foil for Gay. Victoria Falconer (usually a musical director) is sassy and feisty as Susan, the \u201cniece\u201d of saloon owner Henry Miller, played with bravura by Phillip Lowe. Kala Gare is an ideal Katie Brown, the woman who, deliciously ambiguously, moves in with Jane, and then snares Lieutenant Gilmartin \u2013 admirably played by Kaya Byrne. Whether you loved the movie, adored Deadwood or saw this production before, see it in the Studio. It\u2019s the funniest, whip-crackingest, shot-drinkingest, heart-warmingest show in town. MUSIC\n\nCONVERGENCE, AUSTRALIAN STRING QUARTET\n\nUtzon Room Opera House, October 21\n\nReviewed by Peter McCallum\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd After the Australian String Quartet\u2019s current leader, Dale Barltrop, had given a quick gloss of the Quartet\u2019s 40-year history, cellist Michael Dahlenburg noted wryly that he also was turning 40 this year. Since it was founded by then leader, violinist William Hennessy, in 1985, each of the quartet\u2019s positions has been occupied by seven different players. However, the vision of performing nationwide and championing Australian music remains. As my former colleague, the late SMH critic Fred Blanks, once quipped, it is still the same old axe, it is just that the head and handle have been replaced seven times.\n\nThe Australian String Quartet at the Utzon Room. Credit: Kate Moroney This concert began with the String Quartet No. 1, Elegies & Dances (2008 revised 2012) by Sydney-based Paul Stanhope, a single-movement work with wide expressive range. The piece began in deep and thoughtful mourning with wailing motives that became transformed into vivid expressions of life and energy as they became more active. The quicker section involved sharp irregular rhythm and rapid textural evolution, until, at its most frenetic point, the propulsive urgency started to dissolve. As the music returned to its opening mood, it acquired warmth, acceptance and seemed released from anguish. Elegies & Dances proved to be an effective pairing with Benjamin Britten\u2019s String Quartet No. 2 in C major, Opus 36 (1945) which followed. Both are works of high craft, develop their ideas with clarity, and position themselves cogently but unselfconsciously within their respective historical and cultural contexts. In Stanhope\u2019s case that included references to the sounds of Indigenous culture, while for Britten, it involved building on forms and gestures from before the time the string quartet was developed and paying homage to English composer Henry Purcell. After a concise first movement and a scurrying, quietly energetic second, it reached its central point in the third movement, Chacony. As with some works of Beethoven and Mahler, it is a slow movement whose expressive profundity overwhelms the rest of the work to the point where any continuation is impossible. The repeated bass on which the movement is built contains an obsessive iambic rhythm like an insistent limp which eventually was smoothed out, leading to a glowing close of ringing C major chords. Schubert\u2019s String Quartet No. 14 in D minor, Death and the Maiden, opened incisively, but the ASQ eased up on \u2018hammerblow\u2019 articulation, to allow longer phrases to cut a deeper swathe. Lyricism and ornate melodic expressiveness adorned the second movement and the finale raced with hypnotic precision, accelerating at the end to make a lemming-like dash to the final bar.\n\nMUSIC\n\nJEAN-EFFLAM BAVOUZET CELEBRATING RAVEL\n\nCity Recital Hall, October 20\n\nReviewed by PETER MCCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Maurice Ravel wrote music of exquisitely blended harmonic tartness and sweetness, clothing old forms with new colours and gradations of light and shade that bathe imaginary structures with magic and mystery. In the case of his works for piano, he also wrote some of the most difficult music ever written, although in the hands of Jean-Efflam Bavouzet that challenge was as nothing, like a dancer also being able to walk. Jean-Efflam Bavouzet. Celebrating Ravel\u2019s sesquicentenary, Bavouzet played, in one recital, most of his major keyboard music, including the haunting, Pre-Raphaelite Pavane pour une infante defunte, his scintillating evocation of fountains, Jeux d\u2019eau and his three major keyboard collections, Miroirs (1904-5), Gaspard de la nuit (1908) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914-17).\n\nTo cap it off, as encore, he gave an astonishing rendition of Ravel\u2019s solo piano arrangement of his orchestral work La Valse (1919-20), a trap for many due to its impractical difficulty, but heard here with outstanding clarity of gesture in all its passion, distortion and excess. Bavouzet spanned Ravel\u2019s wide range of textures with affinity, subtlety and mastery. He began with an early rarity, Serenade grotesque, which seems to evoke Punch-and-Judy masks, mixing leering taunts with an expressive melody of touching simplicity. The piece anticipates Ravel\u2019s interest in the grotesque that was to reach such towering heights in Scarbo (from Gaspard de la nuit) and La Valse. Between the appearances of the strangely beautiful melody the Pavane, Bavouzet created softly voiced episodes of transparent stillness. His performance of Jeux d\u2019eau contrasted swirling limpid movement with a climax of glistening intensity. In Noctuelles, the first piece of Miroirs, Bavouzet created fleeting, impulsive lightness which glided into ethereal invisibility at the close. Oiseaux tristes was layered with a murmuring background cut through by incisive bright points of painful colour. In Une barque sur l\u2019ocean Bavouzet set up multiple different velocities, counterpointing a solemn majestic theme with rapid glittering eddies and broader waves of threatening turbulence which erupted in a moment of frothy peril. After the quick virtuosic energy of Alborada del gracioso, La vallee des cloches returned to layered stillness. While it was disappointing not to hear Bavouzet\u2019s superb pianism in Ravel\u2019s tender and flirtatious Valses nobles et sentimentales which was originally advertised, the shimmering beauty, ominous distant echoes and fizzing virtuosity of the three movements of Gaspard de la nuit more than compensated. Of the many highlights in the neo-Baroque masterpiece, Le tombeau de Couperin, I will just mention the delightfully piquant astringency he created in the forlane, the tender delicacy of the menuet and the brilliant radiance at the close of the toccata. It is hard to imagine a better way to honour Ravel\u2019s genius. MUSIC\n\nGREGORY PORTER|\n\nConcert Hall, Sydney Opera House, October 20\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nGregory Porter\u2019s voice is like a log fire on a winter\u2019s night. It doesn\u2019t just radiate warmth, it has a comfort factor. It\u2019s the voice of someone who\u2019s worked out a thing or two about this very temporary exercise called life, and wants to ease the suffering and spread a little beneficence with a generosity of heart that\u2019s the opposite of those people who win talent quests by impressing. Porter has bigger fish to fry than merely impressing. A mere nine years ago he was at the old Basement. Now he\u2019s packing out the Concert Hall with fans who know all the songs, having been seduced by the voice of this barrel-chested man in the trademark hat, who can fleetingly remind you of singers ranging from Nat King Cole to Marvin Gaye, yet sounds only like himself. He lets jazz flow into soul as naturally as two rivers meeting, so it\u2019s impossible to define where they merge. Gregory Porter in action on stage at the Opera House. Credit: Johannes Napp Most of the songs are his own, with lyrics about coping, loving, hoping and improving. The latter\u2019s quite an attractive idea, given most of us seem to believe that bemoaning our lot is a form of conversation. You feel the truth of the magnanimity with Porter, not just via the lyrics and the amusing between-song chat, but via the voice itself, which seems to proclaim that goodness is possible, and you leave the two-hour show briefly believing it. His long-term quartet has been augmented by organist Ondrej Pivec, who maximises the inherent drama of a Hammond B-3, and provides another soloing voice to join tenor saxophonist Tivon Pennicott and pianist Chip Crawford. Bassist Jahmal Nichols anchors the music, while also providing the night\u2019s most engrossing solo feature, which builds into a groove so wicked it must be barely legal, and then morphs into two rare covers: The Temptations\u2019 My Girl and Papa Was a Rolling Stone. Drummer Emanuel Harrold remains the joker in the pack: unusually busy for the soul side of the idiom (if not the jazz), and ensuring the music is energised and studded with surprises.\n\nPorter\u2019s anthemic Musical Genocide drops away to just Crawford\u2019s piano, which slips into Waltzing Matilda. Although Porter doesn\u2019t sing it, the audience does, and what could easily have been corny is actually quite touching. More moving is Porter\u2019s Water Under Bridges, ostensibly about a break-up; more pertinently about how his brother helped him cope: a brother who died during the pandemic. Sung with only piano accompaniment this allows us to immerse ourselves in his voice\u2019s richness. Seldom does he unleash its full magnificence, but when he does, as on the spiritual Wade in the Water, you are physically pushed back by its power. The sound was second-rate to start, and never became quite as sharply focused as it can be in this room, although it did keep improving, right through to the second (genuinely demanded) encore. MUSIC\n\nKarnivool\n\nEnmore Theatre, October 19\n\nReviewed by ROD YATES\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 When Karnivool guitarist Mark Hosking steps up to the microphone and thanks the audience for sticking with them over the years, he acknowledges that they are a band that require patience from their fans. They postpone shows, he says \u2013 a reference to the fact that this evening\u2019s gig was originally scheduled to take place last July before illness rendered the quintet unable to perform \u2013 and they take years between albums.\n\nKarnivool in full flight at the Enmore Theatre. Credit: Kane Hibberd Indeed, when their new record In Verses comes out in 2026, it will be only their fourth full-length since forming in Perth in 1998 and will drop a whopping 13 years after predecessor Asymmetry. In the here-today-gone-later-today nature of music stardom in 2025, rare is the band that can treat their release schedule with such disdain yet still command the kind of loyalty that enables them to sell out the 2500-capacity Enmore Theatre with ease. That they share a special bond with their audience is obvious. From the genuine glee that flashes across the face of vocalist Ian Kenny when greeting the crowd to the way in which the punters morph into a mass choir during closer New Day and the thundering Themata, the overwhelming feeling from both band and audience is release. Contributing to that sense is the group\u2019s mastery at creating musical tension.\n\nDrummer Steve Judd\u2019s mindbogglingly complex rhythms and the intricate guitar interplay between Hosking and Drew Goddard combine to form a dark, dense, prog-metal symphony that they tease to a thundering climax in the epic Deadman and a gloriously heavy Roquefort. Of the two new tracks Karnivool have released this year they open with one in Drone and put the other, Aozora, third song in. That they do this rather than go for a cheap win by opening with an old favourite like Cote (which appears later in the set) speaks volumes about the confidence of the band and the trust they place in their audience to go along for the ride. After almost three decades, though, those fans know the deal \u2013 Karnivool will march to the beat of their own drum and indulge their musical whims without any care for the demands of the mainstream. In return, they will deliver a masterful show like this. MUSIC\n\nBURNA BOY\n\nQudos Bank Arena, October 18\n\nReviewed by SHAMIM RAZAVI\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Burna Boy\u2019s current tour takes him places no African artist has gone before, and his first Sydney headline show is no exception: it\u2019s hard to imagine that Olympic Park has ever hosted a Nigerian party of these proportions, with even the food trucks putting on their best impersonations of jollof rice and swallows. Inside the arena, the mood was authentic Afrofusion: an Afrobeats base with aesthetic influences from the rest of the world.\n\nThat African base was ever present \u2013 in the Yoruba-Pidgin lyrics, in the use of the talking drum and shekere instruments, in the infectious familial informality \u2014 but fused with global elements ranging from Kingston Town rhythms to Ed Sheeran aesthetics straight from the badlands of Ipswich: a sound as global as it is grounded. Burna Boy in full flight at Qudos Bank Arena. Credit: Glenn Pokorny Burna\u2019s studio production is glossy and complicated, which in the hands of a lesser artist might have been a disappointment live. Not so for the African Giant: in his case, less polish and more talent actually improved on his overstuffed recordings. His baritone especially benefited from the concert treatment \u2013 with AutoTune dialled back, we were reminded of the charm and intensity that sets his act apart from his peers. In fact, the a cappella intro to It\u2019s Plenty drops the vocal filters altogether and he sounds properly masterful as a result. The price for this willingness to experiment and mix things up was the occasional misfire. Bank on It was transformed with a smooth-jazz vibe, complete with a sax line straight from the Kenny G songbook: more lounge than Lagos; the CGI screen backdrops were more artificial than intelligent, and the occasional keytar on stage, like an escapee from a wedding band, only highlighted the strange aesthetic choices. Not that anyone seemed to mind, judging by the assortment of audience underwear thrown on stage. Shirtless from the second song, Burna Boy worked that rich voice and charisma hard, building to a closing climax of Ye and Last Last. And yet, for all the heat and magnetism, there was something missing \u2013 a looseness and unrestraint that would have transformed this good night into a great one: the gap between smouldering and fire.\n\nMUSIC\n\nGORDI\n\nPlayhouse, Sydney Opera House, October 17\n\nReviewed by BERNARD ZUEL\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Though neither of them occurred during the performance, two medical episodes punctuated this show and told us something about Sophie Payten in both normal and Gordi mode, in medical and musical personas. The lesser of them, told in comic semi-pantomime, concerned Payten at the dentist when one of her songs, Heaven I Know, came on the surgery\u2019s playlist like the universe was helping convince them she really was a musician. On stage, that song built from looped and live vocal layers and slowly accreting instruments until we had an alterna-choir that served as a kind of halo around the simple lines of an ending and acceptance. \u201cYeah, I got older, and we got tired/Heaven I know, that we tried.\u201d Gordi aka Sophie Payten performs at the Sydney Opera House. Credit: Gabrielle Clement More seriously, the other story featured a patient of hers \u2013 Payten completed her medical studies during and immediately after COVID lockdowns \u2013 who confronted news of his imminent death with a level of equanimity that would be beyond most of us, leaving an impact on his young doctor.\n\nThe two songs inspired by this experience were not leaden but rather a flow of warm energy that pushed everything forward and a blend of Elliott Smith and Bon Iver as pure pop immersed in hazy winter. Around these three songs, in material that included all the tracks of her new-ish album, Like Plasticine, and scattered shots from previous releases, Payten/Gordi moved between endings and rebuilding, back and forth from thickened layers to modestly proportioned instrumentation, counter-intuitively guitar-pushed vibrant when crushed and synth-filled solemn when emotionally buoyant, and often distorting her voice through various effects as if not wanting clarity to be confused with truth. Songs found her uncertain on questing love (\u201cDo you care? Do you care?/Don\u2019t make me your peripheral lover\u201d), falling on a failure (\u201cI made available a portion of my heart/Not anymore\u201d) and rising again on the certainty of comfort (\u201cI know the pressure you feel seems relentless/But everything is fleeting, except you and I\u201d). And then, closing with Can We Work It Out, on the horns of a dilemma \u2013 ready to believe, but bracing for regret \u2013 she threw at us the bushiest and brightest song of the night with its solid propulsion and almost fizzing slices of vocals. THEATRE\n\nDAYTIME DEEWANE\n\nRiverside, October 18, until October 25\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIn 1980s Britain, after racist club bouncers wouldn\u2019t give anyone with brown skin their share of night, a new underground subculture emerged. These were the Daytimers, day parties run by South Asian collectives, where shunned ravers could congregate on their own terms, to their own DJs, dancing to new music blending bass-kicked Bhangra, Asian garage and diaspora-mixed jungle. Azan Ahmed sets his award-winning 2022 play at the last Daytimer party, in London in 1997. Sixteen-year-old Farhan (Ariyan Sharma), wonders whether Islam forbids dancing as he scurries nervously in school uniform towards his first-ever rave. His 20-year-old rude-boy cousin Sadiq (Ashan Kumar), bounces about impatiently in wifebeater vest and chains, breaking into rhapsodies on the dancefloor\u2019s true radical principles of defiance, humanism and transcendent release. Ariyan Sharma and Ashan Kumar are excellent as two cousins on clashing coming-of-age trajectories in Daytime Deewane. Credit: Phil Erbacher Built on the twists in its character foils, Daytime Deewane unfolds as a story about these two very different young Muslim men, each trying to define his means and methods of self-respect against the values and expectations of his heritage. It loses its beat in the last stretch \u2013 the time leap to a reunion scene strikes an off-key chord and leaves us with an ambiguous moral takeaway \u2013 but there\u2019s a lot to rate highly in this play about migration, masculinity and faith. Its two leads go point-for-point in endowing Riverside\u2019s Australian premiere with humour and depth. Sharma gives us signature goof as the duty-bound teenage square, cutting Farhan the weirdest of shapes as an aspirational \u201cpeacock\u201d bro while asking where the prayer room\u2019s at.",

    "text": "When I was a kid, I lived near an old guy, Mr Lamont, a retired man who\u2019d once been an accountant. He must have been short of dough because one year, when the Royal Agricultural Show came to town, he hired on as a skeleton. He turned up at the showgrounds where they dressed him in a bodystocking painted with luminous bones and paid him to leap from the darkness, scaring people as they rode the Ghost Train. At day\u2019s end, I\u2019d hang around his front gate and pester him for stories of these emaciated ambushes and their resulting panic.\n\nHe spoke of those Ghost Train adventures in low tones, like it was a secret between us that our fellow townsfolk were such suckers, so yellow, not the heroes they pretended to be. Oh, how those passengers in his stories squealed and swore and buried their heads in each other\u2019s shirtfronts when he appeared from the dark in luminous bones. Sometimes, they sprang out of their train carriages and stampeded for cracks of daylight. If one did it, they all did it, Mr Lamont said. No one lingered. Once the first chicken made a break for reality, the carriage emptied pronto.\n\nCredit: Robin Cowcher\n\nI was a brave boy who would never flee from a slow-moving skeleton that smelt deliciously of licorice and Craven As. Particularly, one that I already knew to be Mr Lamont in a leotard. So I delighted in the terror of that train\u2019s passengers. It brought them down to my size. It bigged me up to theirs. The mother abandoning her kids, shouting, \u201cMy God, it\u2019s real. It\u2019s bones.\u201d The ex-mayor who had once shot a Lee Enfield .303 at Japanese Zeros hollering to his wife to, \u201cKeep it away, keep it away.\u201d The cop-baiting sharpie who wet himself and had to walk along sideshow alley covering his jeans crotch with a pink cloud of fairy floss. Out there at his front gate, Mr Lamont and I laughed until our stomachs hurt. \u201cBlow accountancy,\u201d he said one day. \u201cBeing a skeleton is really living.\u201d\n\nI admired and envied that radiant skeleton\u2019s power to humble hard-nosed matriarchs unto prayer and turn moustache-twirling grandees into scalded hounds hightailing it for safety. It showed me the least of us could do mighty things given a chance. A scrawny nobody in tricked-up undies was humbling big names in the dark. It was Christ-like. What possibilities this world offered a person willing to believe in himself.",

    "text": "It is the equivalent of a VVIP room in the already exclusive dual international club: an elite handful who have the extra flex of having competed at an Olympics as well. In Australia, there are only nine in the last 116 years - and most of them were in the same gold-medal winning team in 1908. Slightly further afield, there are a couple more household names like Sonny Bill Williams and Semi Radradra. So who are the \u201ccrown duals\u201d? The 1908 crew\n\nA year and a day after the NSW Rugby League was founded in 1907, the Australian rugby team embarked on a 41-game tour of the British Isles and North America. It was noteworthy on several fronts; it was the first time they were called \u201cthe Wallabies\u201d, and midway through the seven-month tour, the team won an Olympic gold medal. With rugby included in the London Olympics, the Wallabies beat Cornwall - the side representing England - in a straight final. When the Wallabies returned home, many followed in the footsteps of Dally Messenger and defected to rugby league - mostly to Newtown and Glebe. Within a year or two, most had also won selection for the Kangaroos, making them the first dual international Olympians. Those men were Bob Craig, Jack Hickey, Chris McKivat, John Barnett, Charles McMurtrie, Patrick McCue, Frank Smith, and Charles Russell.

The skilful playmaker led the Kangaroos to their first-ever Ashes victory over Great Britain on British soil. Dick Thornett Dick Thornett playing for Parramatta. Credit: Fairfax Media The youngest of the incredible Thornett brothers, who were giants of the Australian sporting landscape in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, Richard - or \u201cDick\u201d - was a supremely gifted athlete, who also joined the dual international Olympian club. Dick had big targets to chase as a youngster, with eldest brother John beginning a stellar Wallabies career in 1955. Playing across most of the forward pack, John Thornett played 37 Tests for the Wallabies over the next 13 years, and captained the team as well.\n\nMiddle brother Ken Thornett switched from rugby to league and quickly became one of the 13-man game\u2019s best fullbacks. He was a star for the Parramatta Eels, and played No.1 for the Kangaroos on the 1963\u201364 Kangaroo Tour that won the Ashes in England for the first time in over 50 years. But Dick ended up matching both brothers and playing for Australia in both codes. He played 11 Tests for the Wallabies as a second rower, alongside his brother John, between 1961 and 1963. Dick Thornett (right), with Arthur Beetson and John Wittenberg in 1968. Credit: Fairfax Archive Dick then switched codes in 1963 and played alongside Ken at Parramatta, becoming a dual international when he also went on the 1963-64 Ashes tour with the Kangaroos. Dick played 13 Tests as a front and second rower. But prior to his stellar football career, Dick Thornett also earned the rare distinction of competing for Australia in water polo at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. A burly presence in the water with a cannon-like shooting arm, Dick was considered a star in water polo, but he elected to pursue footy.\n\nGiven all the other dual international Olympians played a variety of rugby at the Games, Thornett\u2019s feat of representing Australia in a third and entirely different sport stands him apart. The only man to come close to joining him is Michael Cleary, who won a bronze medal in the 100m sprint at the Commonwealth Games in Perth in 1962, between his stints as a Wallaby and a future Kangaroo winger. Mark Nawaqanitawase \u201cMarky Mark\u201d played his first game for NSW in rugby union in 2020 and went on to debut for the Wallabies in 2022. With his Fjiian heritage, Nawaqanitawase was also in demand as a sevens rugby player, and he played for Australia at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Mark Nawaqanitawase has been a revelation for the Roosters.

The team came fourth.\n\nAnd some others Having first represented New Zealand in rugby league in 2004, and then for the All Blacks in rugby (where he won two World Cups), Sonny Bill Williams set his sights on making the New Zealand sevens Olympic team in 2016 in Rio. SBW made the team and became an Olympian, but ruptured his achilles tendon in one of the pool games. Former Parramatta Eels winger Semi Radradra played for the Kangaroos in 2016, and then represented his native Fiji in rugby from 2018 after switching back to rugby. In 2021, he joined the Fijian sevens team and played at the Tokyo Olympics, where he helped Fiji defend their 2016 gold medal.

Danilo P\u00e9rez saved his confession until the end of his solo show at the Melbourne International Jazz Festival, telling us how nervous he\u2019d been before the concert. P\u00e9rez may be one of the most respected and experienced artists in contemporary jazz, having spent decades touring the world with his bands (and those of legends such as Wayne Shorter and Dizzy Gillespie), but he rarely performs solo. Danilo P\u00e9rez performs at the Melbourne Recital Centre during the Melbourne International Jazz Festival. Credit: Duncographic This was a unique opportunity for the Panamanian pianist-composer to give free rein to his creative impulses \u2013 and for us to witness the unfurling of that creativity in real time. Throughout his generous set, it was clear that P\u00e9rez was letting his curiosity lead the music wherever it wanted. His prodigious technical facility gave his right and left hands complete independence, allowing him to simultaneously fashion and explore melodic themes, contrapuntal lines, chord progressions and rhythmic concepts.\n\nEach piece brimmed with dazzling variations and a constant sense of discovery \u2013 an approach which made the music feel almost three-dimensional, as if P\u00e9rez were uncovering different facets of a precious stone that sparkled and turned in his mind\u2019s eye. Loading Most of the compositions were his own, interspersed with some inventive treatments of pop tunes and an improvisation on Waltzing Matilda that began as a playful parody (complete with kooky effects from P\u00e9rez\u2019s digital keyboard) before morphing into an unexpectedly tender ode. A standing ovation prompted two superb encores: an ingenious medley of Monk tunes and a gorgeous ballad with a title that summed up the audience\u2019s enthralled response: Gratitude. Later that evening, a quintet of Melbourne musicians paid tribute to a giant of Australian jazz: the late drummer Allan Browne. Browne was a dedicated mentor as well as a hugely influential musician, and the performers (Andrea Keller, Eugene Ball, Phil Noy, Nick Haywood and Dave Beck) spoke of the profound impact Browne had on them.\n\nTogether, they revisited tunes they\u2019d recorded and performed with Browne over the years, featuring arrangements that were as multi-faceted as Browne himself. There were passages of graceful lyricism, poetic angularity, surreal abstraction and profound sorrow leavened by beauty. Each piece was suffused with the players\u2019 affection and deep respect for Browne and his legacy, making this a truly heartfelt homage. Adam Manning performing in First Rhythms. Credit: Will Hamilton Coates On Sunday, percussionist and Kamilaroi artist Adam Manning (First Nations artist-in-residence at the festival) presented a new commissioned work, First Rhythms. Performing alongside members of the Australian Art Orchestra, Manning was clearly moved by the empathy and sensitivity of the AAO musicians he had worked with over the past year to create this meditative work. Clapsticks served as the beating heart of First Rhythms, but in Manning\u2019s hands their pulse was organic and unpredictable, as in nature. Quivering string instruments conjured buzzing insects or the shimmer of a desert mirage; rolling drums evoked ocean waves or clouds in a turbulent sky. In the exquisite final movement, Manning sat cross-legged on the floor and leant forward as if listening to Mother Earth, echoing her subtle vibrations with his clapsticks and gently inviting us to connect with Country, ourselves and one another.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas\n\nThe Melbourne International Jazz Festival continues until Sunday, October 26\n\nNOTE: No star rating has been applied\n\nTHEATRE\n\nMidland Highway Revisited \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Motley Bauhaus, until October 25 Indie performance in Melbourne is going through a rough patch, with La Mama Theatre dark all year, and The Butterfly Club, a much-loved cabaret venue in the CBD, closing suddenly in July. The Motley Bauhaus in Carlton has picked up some of the slack, and it\u2019s worthing checking out the talent there. Midland Highway Revisited at the Motley Bauhaus Following hot on the heels of its vibrant Fringe program comes an eerie comic cabaret from central Victoria that will appeal to fans of Oz gothic, history buffs, and lovers of local country and folk music. Midland Highway Revisited: An Investigative Musical from A Haunted House isn\u2019t really a musical. It\u2019s more like a fascinating live podcast, with songs.\n\nTwins Liz and Sarah (from indie folk band Taylor Project) undertake a forensic examination of whether their house in Elmore, near Bendigo, is haunted. It\u2019s soon clear these musical ghostbusters will have their hands full. As one of them notes: \u201cHaunting can just mean paying attention to things.\u201d And boy, do they pay attention, with a nerdy hyperfocus on hyperlocal history. Loading Starting with acknowledgement of Aboriginal sovereignty, the depredations of colonialism and the Victorian gold rushes (the traditional owners of the land, the Dja Dja Wurrung, call the area \u201cupside down country\u201d due to the amount of gold mining), the artists suss out the history of their own home. There\u2019s a lot to uncover. The house had a former life as an RSL club. When they bought it, they found a dilapidated guitar with a love message from the 1990s carved onto the back \u2026 and dutifully track down the story behind it. A lonely widow. Lightning strikes. Eccentric local musos. Disturbing dreams and whiskers in the walls. Waves of economic recession that left a ghost town and a cemetery in the middle of nowhere. Songs composed by the dead.\n\nPersonal (and genealogical) anecdote is woven throughout, and the yarning is delivered with comic charm and engrossing attention to detail. These artists are all about the research and press nerd buttons with infectious enthusiasm. Songs rove from satirical ditties to plangent local country numbers, such as Pissin\u2019 Down in Colbo, and the musical haunting includes a Bob Dylan number from the seminal album Highway 61 Revisited. There are even more ghosts than the twins know. The phrase \u201cevery love story is a ghost story\u201d doesn\u2019t, in fact, first appear in David Foster Wallace, for instance, but in the diaries of Australian writer Christina Stead, still haunted by the death of her husband. That said, the show needs less not more. The wealth of material in this shaggy dog of a cabaret could use a director or a dramaturg to tidy things up a bit, and I hope it gets the attention it deserves. Reviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nOPERA\n\nKatya Kabanova \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nVictorian Opera, Palais Theatre, until October 16 Czech composer Leos Janacek suffered a long obsession with a four-decades-younger married woman. His passion was entirely unrequited, but music lovers got incalculable benefits, as Kamila Stosslova inspired a string of compositions, including Katya Kabanova \u2013 one of the great but rarely performed operas of the 20th century. Desiree Frahn and Andrew Goodwin in a scene from Katya Kabanova. Credit: Jeff Busby It is the story of a young wife who endures a bullying mother-in-law and a weak husband under the thumb of his mother. Victorian Opera\u2019s production scored at every turn, with a splendid Australian cast, ingenious and creative production, and daring and clever use of live black and white video throughout on a full-stage screen. Not least was the Australian National Academy of Music orchestra\u2019s extraordinary playing, sensitively and effectively led by Alexander Briger (nephew of Charles Mackerras, one of the finest Janacek conductors).\n\nThe singers had to act superbly because they were near-constantly several times life-size on the screen. Soprano Desiree Frahn was simply stellar in every respect as Katya, while Antoinette Halloran as the malevolent mother looked as though she were born to the role (if that is, in fact, a compliment!), in a mesmeric presence. Emily Edmonds was a delightful Varvara and all the men were accomplished \u2013 especially Andrew Goodwin as Boris and Adrian Tamburini as Dikoj \u2013 although this opera is really a vehicle for the women. The staging was occasionally obscure \u2013 for example, there were sometimes up to six other silent Katyas on stage. I\u2019ve no idea what this signified \u2013 possibly the incoherent thoughts rushing through her brain as her mental state unravelled. Loading Director Heather Fairbairn was adventurous, courageous and persuasive. Credit too to set and costume designer Savanna Wegman and video designer Robert Brown, whose video, with two camera operators on stage, was mostly highly effective. Amusingly, when Katya was having sex offstage, the video briefly turned to colour. This Katya deserves five stars for its energy, originality and general excellence, not to mention Victorian Opera\u2019s vision in staging it.\n\nReviewed by Barney Zwartz\n\nDANCE\n\nThe Other Side of Me \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFairfax Studio, until October 19 Larrakia choreographer and teacher Gary Lang is a welcome addition to the DanceX festival. His NT Dance Company \u2013 known for its cross-over collaborations with companies such as West Australian Ballet \u2013 is not seen often enough in Melbourne. The Other Side of Me is well worth experiencing for its own sake. It\u2019s based on the true story of an Indigenous boy who was adopted when he was five and taken to England, where he had an obscure and troubled life. In a letter, he confessed to feeling torn between two selves \u2013 the one he knew and the one he left behind. The Other Side of Me explores the feeling of being torn between two selves. Credit: Paz Tassone Lang\u2019s piece explores the emotional dimensions of this divided self \u2013 the melancholy, the rage and finally a fragile sense of the possibility of reunion. It suggests the desire for a return, not necessarily to a geographical place, but to a deeper sense of belonging.\n\nIt\u2019s performed by two dancers, Alexander Abbot and Chandler Connell, who embody the young man\u2019s twin souls. Early scenes evoke restraint \u2013 bodies and gestures held back. Projected images of weathered natural forms, shells and skeletal leaves, extend this mood: damaged, suspended, touched by grief. Then comes violence. The spirit turns upon itself. There\u2019s real intensity here, collisions and counterforces, a kind of self-wrestling. The blows are powerful but loose: the youth is ungrounded, fighting to locate himself in his own body. The work is very open and might resonate with anyone displaced or divided between worlds. It paints in moods rather than concrete images or situations, and at times it feels a little slippery, fleeting in its description of emotional states. The Other Side of Me is well worth experiencing. Credit: Paz Tassone Nonetheless, the finale is satisfying. The projected images are more specific: forests, rugged coastlines, a place that feels out of reach. And the two dancers, both robust but articulate movers, bring it home as a more ritualised vocabulary is asserted.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nDANCE\n\nDanceX festival week 2 \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nPlayhouse, until October 19 Stephanie Lake\u2019s Auto Cannibal is an apt work to open the second week of Dance X because its concept \u2013 recycling fragments of earlier work \u2014 echoes the festival\u2019s own logic of revival and renewal. Lake\u2019s choreography turns self-quotation into an aesthetic argument: old material takes on fresh meaning when performed in a changed context. Auto Cannibal by Stephanie Lake. Credit: Jade Ellis Now more than five years old, it was first created for a cross-cultural collaboration between companies in Beijing and Brisbane. Here, it is restaged for Melbourne-based dancers with connections to Lake\u2019s other projects. The ensemble includes many distinctive presences \u2013 big dance personalities, bold movers \u2013 which gives the work a somewhat eclectic vibe. It\u2019s full of large gestures with a bright communal energy: a very different sensibility to her most recent commission for the Australian Ballet, Seven Days, which used exaggerated expressions and playful, clown-like movement seemingly influenced by the company\u2019s recent engagement with contemporary European dance.",

Add delivery, service, and bag fees, and the overall bill can jump up to 39 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIncredibly, some were up to 42 per cent more expensive \u2014 with the \"biggest markup\" on a Coles ice cream cone four-pack.\n\nIn-store, they were $3.70, while on DoorDash, customers would pay $5.25.\n\nCHOICE looked at a comparable basket of items to find out what consumers are paying for the convenience of rapid delivery via apps such as DoorDash, Uber Eats and Milkrun. Source: CHOICE\n\nCustomers didn't know they were paying for 'disorganisation'\n\nCustomers interviewed by CHOICE were unaware of the big differences. \"I expect to pay for delivery and service, but not extra for the items,\" customer Mel told CHOICE.\n\nMilkrun customer Jo said she expected the prices to be the same, given the service is \"owned by Woolies\".\n\nShe didn't take issue with the delivery fee, admitting she was paying for her \"disorganisation\".\n\nExtra costs for Coles, Aldi and Woolworths shoppers\n\nCHOICE editorial director Mark Serrels said getting groceries delivered \"to your door within an hour\" is ideal for Aussies with a \"busy schedule\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut the price shock might make you think twice.\n\nSeven of 13 Aldi items cost more on DoorDash, while 12 of 13 Woolworths items were pricier on MilkRun. For all other comparisons, delivery apps always came out more expensive.\n\n\"If you purchase a 400g tub of Lurpak in-store from Woolworths, it\u2019s $9. If you forget you\u2019ve run out of spread for tomorrow\u2019s sandwiches and place an order via Uber Eats, it will cost you a whopping $10.20,\" Serrels said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the costs keep adding up \u2014 there are also delivery costs, which may include service fees, delivery fees, and sometimes bag fees ranging from $5 to just over $11,\" Serrels said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"For Coles, we compared the products with what you\u2019d pay in-store versus via Uber Eats and DoorDash. For Woolworths, we compared in-store prices to prices through MilkRun and Uber Eats, and for Aldi, we looked at in-store costs and the price when delivery was made via DoorDash.\n\n\"When we compared them, the flat fee for a fast delivery from the Coles and Woolworths websites was $15. This matched the price of our Coles orders from DoorDash and Uber Eats, but for Woolworths, the MilkRun order was the cheapest option.\"\n\nGroceries might cost up to 40 per cent extra when ordering from supermarkets via services like Uber Eats.\n\nSupermarkets weigh in\n\nThe supermarkets told CHOICE that \"higher prices reflect the cost of convenience\".\n\nWoolworths said pricing on MilkRun was different due to the level of convenience offered, adding that all prices were clearly marked and delivery fees clearly disclosed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDoorDash said higher prices reflect the additional costs of providing an on-demand service, \"such as technology, operations and delivery logistics\".\n\nColes added that this \"ensures we can offer the service to our customers wanting instant delivery options, particularly when they are in a time crunch,\" and noted customers \"offer better value options such as delivery or Click and Collect\".\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "Back in May, the parent companies of private hospital operator Healthscope fell into receivership, burdened by A$1.6 billion in debt.\n\nSince then, Healthscope\u2019s hospitals have been kept open while receivers have worked to find buyers for the business. But now, the groundwork has also been laid for a potential restructuring of Healthscope as a charity.\n\nThis would allow the new entity to access a number of tax benefits \u2013 including tax exemptions on \u201cfringe benefits\u201d provided to employees.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn its own, this might not appear all that controversial. However, Healthscope reportedly wants to access a substantial proportion of the tax break that would normally accrue to the employee. Employees have been asked to vote on the proposal.\n\nWhat are fringe benefits?\n\nA fringe benefit is a form of compensation provided to an employee by an employer, in addition to salary or wages.\n\nSalary packaging is essentially breaking the employee compensation into salary and fringe benefits. For example, an employer pays certain costs for an employee \u2013 such as rent and mortgage payments, or their children\u2019s school fees \u2013 and in return the employee agrees to have their salary reduced.\n\nAny employer can provide fringe benefits to employees. But some organisations, including not-for-profit hospitals, are eligible for exemptions from the fringe benefits tax, up to a cap.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor not-for-profit and public hospitals, the tax-free benefit to each employee is capped at a \u201cgrossed-up\u201d value of the benefit of $17,000, which works out to be roughly $9,000 in value of benefits per year.\n\nFor current purposes, the thinking behind the grossed-up value of a benefit need not be explored; our focus should be on the $9,000 figure, the economic value of a benefit.\n\nThe main justification for this tax exemption is that not-for-profit hospitals cannot pay the same sort of salaries as the for-profit sector to attract staff. This concession helps balance things out a bit.\n\nAn example of salary packaging\n\nLet\u2019s illustrate salary packaging with an example relevant to the Healthscope proposed scenario.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSay an employee is on a taxable income of $80,000 (wages). The top part of this (every dollar over $45,000) attracts the 30% marginal tax rate. For simplicity, ignore the 2% Medicare levy.\n\nA not-for-profit hospital employer could ask this employee to \u201cgive up\u201d the top $10,000 of their pre-tax wages. In return, the hospital could agree to pay $9,000 of the worker\u2019s private expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments.\n\nThe employee is not taxed on receipt of this $9,000 in benefits. And because of the concession, the not-for-profit hospital wouldn\u2019t have to pay employer fringe benefits tax on it either.\n\nThe employee is better off by $2,000 ($9,000 compared to the $7,000 of after-tax income where cash salary is paid). The employer (a charity) has also reduced its costs from $10,000 (wages) to $9,000 (benefit). The only \u201closer\u201d would be the public purse.\n\nAdministration fee\n\nAn administration fee for a salary packaging arrangement is standard, either a fixed fee or small percentage of the tax saving made and accruing to the employee.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHowever, the Healthscope proposal would reportedly require the employee to \u201chand over\u201d a large portion of the tax saving \u2013 as much as 90% in certain circumstances.\n\nThe Healthscope \u201cfee\u201d seems too high to just recoup the employer\u2019s administrative costs for the salary packaging.\n\nFringe benefits tax concessions for not-for-profit and public hospitals can help them attract and retain staff. Morsa Images/Getty\n\nLegal considerations\n\nWould the proposed compensation switch be legally effective? The answer is unclear.\n\nThe Australian Taxation Office (ATO) may be concerned with this. That\u2019s because the salary packaging would be done in a different environment to the ordinary type of packaging, because the employer changed from a taxable entity into an tax-exempt entity.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is unusual, especially when the taxable entity is in financial distress, like Healthscope.\n\nThe counterargument is that Healthscope would be accessing a specific concession \u2013 provided to a not-for-profit hospital in the fringe benefits tax legislation \u2013 for the \u201cbenefit\u201d of employees in a certain sector.\n\nWhat about ethics?\n\nWhether Healthscope\u2019s proposal is ethical is another question and brings in subjective considerations. It is fair to say that Healthscope\u2019s charity option is drawing on the tax system to help implement a lower cost structure to its operations.\n\nIt could reignite the long-standing debate about the appropriateness of allowing tax-exempt charities and other not-for-profits to operate large businesses (and obtain/retain tax exemption) in competition with taxable, for-profit companies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMany other tax concessions could also become available on the switch to a charity, such as exemption from company income tax and exemption from state taxes, including payroll tax \u2013 a state tax on wages paid by employers.\n\nThe potential for lost income tax revenue is not clear-cut because Healthscope may not have paid much income tax lately anyway. Given the number of employees (around 19,000), the loss of payroll tax to the states could be significant on the switch to a registered charity.\n\nThe business is still for sale\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Healthscope\u2019s receivers are still inviting offers for the sale of its hospital businesses. The charity option is just one option the receivers want to lay the groundwork for.\n\nIt is highly advisable for employees of Healthscope to obtain independent advice on the proposal\u2019s possible financial impacts \u2013 such as whether employer superannuation contributions are required on fringe benefits \u2013 before voting on what appears to be an amendment to the enterprise agreement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
