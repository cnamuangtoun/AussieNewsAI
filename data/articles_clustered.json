(Supplied)\n\n\"This is alarming. It appears Telstra has tricked Australians into paying top dollar for coverage they simply can't get on a regular mobile phone,\" Kieren Cooney from TPG Telecom said.\n\n\"We are shocked that Telstra appears to have been overstating its coverage by so much for so long and we are calling on them to make it right.\n\n\"Telstra's conduct could have misled consumers into believing they can get coverage in places that require special equipment.\n\nTelstra changed its coverage advertising after a complaint to the ACCC.

(Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThis claim is critical to Vodafone's competition in the market, having recently boosted their own coverage after a network sharing deal with Optus that sees them now reaching closer to or over one million square kilometres.\n\nTelstra stands by their claim, pointing out that it is Vodafone who has changed the way they measure coverage.\n\n\"No matter how you look at it, Telstra's mobile network covers more of Australia than any other. Any suggestion that we've misled the public about the size of our network is completely untrue,\" a Telstra spokesperson told 9News.com.au.\n\n\"Using our coverage maps, customers have always been able to determine our level of coverage with and without an external antenna, so they always knew what to expect based on the device they're using.\n\nLegendary actress swaps mansion for prison cell View Gallery\n\n\"Many customers in regional and remote areas benefit from using external antennas to maximise their coverage.\n\n\"This is why we have used this as the basis for our coverage footprint.\n\n\"Now that Vodafone has communicated to us how it's chosen to calculate its coverage footprint, to help the public understand the difference, we're highlighting that our three million square kilometres of coverage is based on using an external antenna.\n\n\"Using coverage maps, people can see the many towns, highways and places where we've invested to provide coverage and Vodafone hasn't. We're all for transparency and industry consistency in how we report coverage and would gladly put our maps up, side-by-side, so that Australians can see the difference.\"",

    "text": "The chances of coming across a Dakar Rally winner at work in regional Australia, knee-deep in a farm dam, are always slim \u2014 but never zero.\n\nVictorian motorbike racer Daniel Sanders is that slim chance.\n\nThe 30-year-old, a rising star in the high-speed world of rally-raid \u2014 and winner of one of the world's toughest races in January \u2014 is focused on the third race of the 2025 World Rally-Raid Championship this week.\n\nBut lately, his mind's been put to much lower-adrenaline pursuits.\n\nSanders celebrates with an Australian flag after winning the Dakar Rally. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\nLush apple farm a world away from desert tracks\n\nSanders had previously said if he wasn't a racer, he'd probably be a farmer.\n\n\"Apples are in full swing here at the moment,\" he said of his 12-week break from competition, at the family farm about 65km from Melbourne.\n\n\"The old man's flat-out picking. I'm just tidying up some machines \u2026 It's been a really dry end to the summer, so we're cleaning out dams and making sure they're ready to fill up for next summer.\"\n\nSanders Apples is a fourth-generation, 100-acre orchard growing on the slopes of a Yarra Valley hillside in Three Bridges \u2014 a locale home to about 200 people and innumerable bush tracks. Beneath the canopies of towering native eucalypts, soft-edged roads wind through the valley's hills.\n\nAway from the track Sanders works on the farm, but motorbikes are never far away. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\nIt's the Aussie's home away from the overseas desert tracks over which he's lately firmed his reputation as a tactical and uncompromising competitor.\n\nRally-raid is a mixed-class category: high-powered dirt bikes race alongside almost futuristic, purpose-built rally cars, and even quad bikes. It's a tactical race against the clock on epic, constantly-changing courses that take days to complete. The World Championship consists of five races this year, beginning with the famed Dakar Rally \u2014 which Sanders won convincingly.\n\nAfter that win \u2014 making Sanders the second Australian to win The Dakar after Toby Price \u2014 and the celebrations that ensued, Sanders returned to Three Bridges as family duty called.\n\nSanders made history as the second Australian to win the Dakar Rally earlier this year. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\nLong, quiet days in the paddock perfect training ground\n\nEven the winner of one of the world's toughest races still had to help around the farm \u2014 not that he complained.\n\n\"I've been pretty busy between training and working on those [farm] machines,\" he said.\n\n\"Tidying things up and making it a bit easier for my old man and my uncles.\n\n\"Making sure the irrigation's good and all the water's running as well.\"\n\nApples are never far away. Sanders with a carton of produce at the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\nDays in the paddock \u2014 sunrise to sunset, he said \u2014 might seem an unusual distraction for a world-class motorbike racer \u2014 especially one who leads a World Championship approaching the season's half-way point.\n\nSome competitors might spend their days burning around a test track or poring over data seeking an edge for the next event.\n\nTo be sure: he'd kept up his training, and wasn't short of social engagements.\n\nBut work around the farm \u2014 training his mind to hone a different kind of focus than the type needed for days spent flat-out on a motorbike \u2014 would, he hoped, help sharpen him for the season's remaining week-long races.\n\n\"It's just a long day like we do in rally, so it's \u2026 training for your mental side,\" he said.\n\n\"When you jump back on a bike it makes you really enjoy it and keeps you motivated.\"\n\nBut inevitably, after a nearly three-month break, the championship race has pulled him back to competition.\n\nThe farming gear has been switched for racing leathers, hat for a helmet, and from work gloves to racing ones \u2014 CHUCKY, his nickname, emblazoned on them above a bright cartoon of a honey-dripped apple.\n\nNow the focus is on the pursuit of victory over the coming days, this time in southern Africa.\n\nApples are an integral part of Daniel Sanders's brand. (Supplied: Daniel Sanders)\n\nSwapping desert sand for dirt and gravel\n\nThe six-day Safari Rally marks the World Rally-Raid Championship's first visit to South Africa, and presents distinctly different challenges to those posed in North Africa and Arabia, where Sanders has lately excelled.\n\nShifting desert dunes, with red-gold sand rising like giant waves, have been the backdrop for each of Sanders's recent wins in Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn South Africa, competitors expect more solid ground.\n\nOrganisers say dirt and gravel will make up three-quarters of the rally's 1,600-kilometre route through the country's expansive northern middleveld and highveld \u2014 midfield and highfield \u2014 a broad area outside Johannesburg defined by its changing vegetation and soils, rising from 600 to 1,800 metres above sea level.\n\nWater crossings, dense bushland and open plains are promised \u2014 maybe even a close encounter with one of Africa's famed natural predators.\n\nA promotional image for the South Arica Safari Rally. (Supplied: South Africa Safari Rally)\n\nSanders expects a close race but, he said, he's hopeful the conditions have parallels to Australia.\n\nA potential home advantage, only 10,000km from the farm.\n\n\"To lose 10 to 20 seconds overshooting an intersection, having to do a U-turn and come back \u2014 I think that's where you're going to lose it,\" he said.\n\nOver the journey, riders and drivers will navigate an arid and unpredictable path. It's a solo race against the clock \u2014 no GPS, no directions, just a digital roadbook and instinct.\n\nHow they reach the finish \u2014 that's largely up to them.\n\nIt means sharpened wit is needed as much as a quick throttle to find the fastest route, often concluding at a campsite hundreds of kilometres from the start line.\n\nA victory is worth 30 points, second place 25, 20 for third. A retirement? Just one.\n\nAnd any one of Sanders's rivals could take the win.\n\nSanders gets serious air while training in Australia.

Third-placed Ricky Brabec (USA) won a rally in Las Vegas last week. Last year's champion Ross Branch \u2014 from neighbouring Botswana \u2014 is among the favourites too.\n\nBut if having rivals chasing his tail-light distracts him, Sanders doesn't show it.\n\n\"I'm sort of all around it at the moment and have strengths everywhere,\" he said going into South Africa.\n\n\"The quicker I can get back into that rhythm, the better the result will be.\"\n\nThe South Africa Safari Rally runs May 19-24.",

(Getty Images: Kevin C. Cox)\n\n\"Am I embarrassed a little bit about how I finished today? Yeah,\" Rahm said.\n\n\"But I just need to get over it, get over myself. It's not the end of the world. It's not like I'm a doctor or a first responder, where somebody, if they have a bad day, truly bad things happen. I'll get over it. I'll move on.\"\n\nThe Spanish star wound up with a two-over 73 and tied for eighth place, eight shots behind Scheffler.\n\nThat would have been an inconceivable outcome for Rahm just an hour before.\n\n\"The last three holes, it's a tough pill to swallow right now,\" he said.\n\n\"Especially knowing 16 is not the narrowest fairway in the world. That bunker is in play. You're lucky enough, you have a shot to the pin. Not a terrible swing, but bad enough to put me in a real difficult situation.\"\n\nBut Rahm said in hindsight he felt the tournament began to slip away on the 14th hole.\n\nDressed in all black with a pink hat on a 30C day, he was looking to become the seventh player to win the PGA Championship after trailing by five or more shots entering the final round.\n\nHe blasted his tee shot on the 14th hole 340 yards onto the oblong green, but instead of the ball tracking toward the flag stick, it took a nasty bounce into the bunker. He hit out of the sand hoping to save birdie, but misread his birdie putt and had to settle for par.\n\nHe misread another birdie putt on 15 and took another par.\n\nThe momentum from his birdie binge on holes 8, 10 and 11 was long gone, and his confidence seemed shaken.\n\nHe had errant drives on 16 and 18 and made double bogeys on the final two holes.\n\n\"I think it was a bit of nerves,\" Rahm said.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"Can't pinpoint exactly right now. I'll go back to what happened. I didn't feel like I rushed anything. I didn't feel like the process was bad.\"\n\nRahm left the course disappointed, receiving a long embrace from his wife.\n\nHe said that when he has time to reflect on the week, he may view it in a different light.\n\nFor 15 holes, he said it was the most fun he's had on the golf course in quite a while. And, he had played himself into contention on the final day of a major championship for the first time since leaving the PGA Tour for LIV Golf in December 2023.\n\n\"Again, there's a lot more positive than negative to think about this week,\" Rahm said.\n\n\"I'm really happy I put myself in [that] position, and hopefully learn from this and give it another go in the US Open. \u2026 I think it's the first time I've been in position to win a major that close and haven't done it. The only times I think I've been in the lead in a major on a Sunday, I've been able to close it out.\n\n\"This is a very different situation.\"\n\nAustralia's Adam Scott also made a brief run at that lead, but faltered late and finished two-under for the tournament, equal with Cam Davis as the best finishing Aussies tied for 19th.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

It didn't matter who was in front of him, he was just able to create havoc.\"\n\nFermor, 25, has also suffered two ACL tears. The latest wiped him out of the 2023 season after he had been invited into the Maroons camp in 2022.\n\nThis year, he has found his groove as a superb edge forward who runs great lines and defends strongly.\n\nLoiero is well-known for being a feisty forward who plays with physicality and work ethic, highlighted by his average of 117m and 32 tackles per game in 2025.\n\nYeo to captain as NSW Blues announce State of Origin team Photo shows Isaah Yeo poses for a photograph during a NSW Blues media day, leaning on a wall, folding his arms Penrith Panthers lock Isaah Yeo has been named the new NSW captain as the Blues team for State of Origin Game I is announced.\n\nThe Maroons have made other selection decisions forced partly by injury.

(ABC Sunshine Coast: Jay Carstens)\n\nEventually, he found another rental through Facebook, and the advertiser took him through a video walk-through of the property.\n\n\"I shouldn't have trusted anyone, but I was a bit desperate,\" Mr Alexander said.\n\nHe supplied personal information to the scammer along with a $1,200 bond payment and $600 for rent in advance, only to find it already occupied when it was time to move in.\n\n\"It wasn't until I went to go move my stuff in that I realised that there was already somebody there,\" he said.\n\n\"They owned the place, and they knew nothing of this person [the scammer].\n\n\"[We were] around the same age \u2026 and they had quite a number of friends, it was very believable\".\n\nMr Alexander moved towns to pursue a nursing course but found himself targeted by rental scammers.

I got chased by a couple of guys with a weapon \u2026 it's been really full-on,\" he said.\n\nHe said seeking help while sleeping rough had been difficult, and access to community services and housing was almost non-existent.\n\n\"All these community services are stretched thin \u2026 [The Department of Housing] actually gave me a gift voucher to go buy a tent,\" he said.\n\n\"I want people to learn from my mistakes.

(ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\nTotal monthly losses to rental scams nearly tripled in Queensland in the past year, with the average loss per scam case doubling in the five months from November to March from $2,280 to $4,683.\n\nQueenslanders are losing more to these kinds of scams than anywhere else in the country, with average personal losses about 60 per cent higher than the national average.\n\nIDCARE spokeswoman Kathy Sundstrom said more than 60 per cent of rental scams were on social media, with 80 per cent coming from organised crime groups overseas.\n\n\"The criminals are not only creating fake social media accounts but are hacking into people's existing account to post listings, creating a false sense of legitimacy,\" she said.\n\n\"It's becoming harder for them [the scammers] to create new accounts so what they prefer to do is to compromise existing ones that take over your account and contact people pretending to be you.\n\n\"It's far more effective because you have a history \u2026 you have a reputation, you have friends, you're so much more believable than just creating a new account.\"\n\nPaula Ford credits her time working at the tax office for knowing how to spot a scammer. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jay Carstens)\n\nSunshine Coast grandmother and former Australian Taxation Office (ATO) debt collector Paula Ford turned to local Facebook groups because the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) was ending.\n\n\"I had to change jobs because this is an NRAS house,\" she said.\n\n\"And the rent was doubling, so I needed to get a job where I could afford to pay the rent but, as it turned out, it didn't work out, given my mental illness.\"\n\nBut as she inquired about two properties listed in the groups, she was not expecting to be asked to make up-front payments to meet the advertiser.\n\n\"Every time I wanted to meet, it was like, 'You have to have the $100 first' and I'm like, 'I'm not going to give $100 to someone I don't know,'\" Ms Ford said.\n\nMs Ford realised she was being targeted by rental scammers when they asked for an up-front payment.

Photo shows NT parliament building The NT government says the territory coordinator bill is the \"most important piece of economic reform\" seen in a decade.\n\nHe gains powers to override dozens of NT laws, including those regulating the environment, pastoral land, petroleum, heritage and water.\n\nOpposition Leader Selena Uibo said the \"high standards expected of the public service\" had not been applied in the government's appointment of Mr Knowles, claiming there was no open recruitment for the role.\n\n\"The Labor opposition is struggling to find the process that has been used to appoint Mr Knowles in this highly-paid taxpayer position for four years,\" she said.\n\n\"What vetting processes were afoot, what open recruitment process has the CLP government followed?\n\n\"So far it looks like none.\"\n\nSelena Uibo has questioned the process around the hiring of Stuart Knowles. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nA government spokesperson said a selection panel undertook a \"formal assessment process\" before Mr Knowles was appointed territory coordinator on Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Knowles said that process assessed his \"private and public sector strategic project experience, and qualifications in management, auditing and corporate governance\".\n\nThe government declined to answer multiple ABC requests for information on how much Mr Knowles would get paid in the role, nor whether it considered other candidates.\n\nKnowles 'deeply sorry' for animal neglect\n\nLabor's questioning in parliament last week also centred around media reports by the NT Independent that Mr Knowles was investigated by NT Animal Welfare for animal neglect 10 years ago.\n\nDuring the investigation, four dogs were seized and taken to a vet for treatment, with a warning issued to Mr Knowles.\n\nTerritory coordinator bill under fresh scrutiny Photo shows The exterior of the Northern Territory's Parliament House building. Changes to the NT's controversial territory coordinator bill that would modify heritage laws and create new powers to enter private property, in a bid to fast-track economic development, have come under fresh scrutiny.\n\nMr Knowles said in a statement he took full responsibility for the \"unintended\" animal neglect.\n\n\"I am deeply sorry for the distress caused to my dogs due to the tick infestation on my property a decade ago,\" he said.\n\n\"I deeply regret my failure to prevent it.\"\n\nMr Knowles said during the investigation, animal welfare officers attended his property three times in six weeks to assess the dogs' condition.\n\n\"After confirming that remedial actions, including tick eradication treatments, were successful and the dogs were in good health, they concluded their investigation,\" he said.\n\n'Open questions' about Knowles's fitness for role, MLA says\n\nIndependent MLA Justine Davis has also raised concerns about Mr Knowles's appointment, saying parliament members know little about how he was chosen for the role.\n\n\"There are open questions about his fitness for the role, the integrity of the recruitment process that led to his appointment, and ongoing concerns about potential conflict of interest \u2014 actual or perceived \u2014 Mr Knowles may have given his prior work with Inpex,\" she said.\n\n\" The territory coordinator holds extraordinary power, the public must be confident that the territory coordinator is a fit and proper person, and the hiring process is rigorous. \"\n\nJustine Davis says there are open questions about the recruitment process. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nMs Davis said the role's selection criteria \u2014 which the new laws limit to \"suitable qualifications or experience\" relating to the territory coordinator's functions \u2014 were \"totally inadequate\".\n\nShe said the legislative scrutiny committee, which she was part of, recommended the job criteria exclude government or judicial officials and people who had donated to a political party in the past.\n\nConcerns new territory coordinator role will 'cut corners' Photo shows Politician looks ahead at press conference The interim territory coordinator faced a barrage of questions during a community consultation session this week on controversial draft laws designed to fast-track major economic projects in the NT.\n\nHowever that request was rejected, along with another recommendation that the territory coordinator's appointment should require the parliament's endorsement.\n\n\"It remains difficult to understand why the CLP would object to basic integrity standards for powerful public service roles like the territory coordinator,\" Ms Davis said.\n\nMr Knowles worked in the Department of Chief Minister and Cabinet prior to joining Inpex as a compliance approvals manager in 2014.\n\nHe went on to become the gas giant's NT general manager, and later worked for a consulting firm before he took on the territory coordinator role.\n\nChief Minister Lia Finocchiaro said Mr Knowles had \"extensive\" public and private sector experience and an \"understanding of the Northern Territory's unique challenges and opportunities\".\n\nLia Finocchiaro has defended the hiring of Stuart Knowles.

    "text": "After more than a decade of boxing, Sam Dwyer knows he is taking a risk.\n\n\"I think it's a bit of cognitive dissonance,\" he said.\n\n\"There's nothing you do in life that doesn't have risk \u2026 but obviously protecting yourself is very important.\"\n\nHowever, a new analysis of head knocks by Central Queensland University's (CQU) Ragnar Purje found that even low-level impacts on the head in sports like boxing can reduce neural function.\n\nThe analysis also highlighted the particular risks of head knocks for children, with even sub-concussive impacts having long-term consequences.\n\nDr Purje's colleague, CQU's head of educational neuroscience Ken Purnell, said experts wanted to make sports \"smarter, not softer\".\n\n\"It's not about banning boxing or karate or soccer or whatever else,\" Professor Purnell said.\n\n\"It's really more about awareness \u2026 all thinking about prioritising that safety for the brain, so the sport can be thriving.\"\n\nDwyer says he's seen boxing grow in popularity in recent years. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nA growing sport\n\nA professional boxer, promoter and gym owner from Mount Gambier in South Australia's south-east, Dwyer started in the sport 13 years ago.\n\n\"It's opened up a whole world of opportunities for me,\" he said.\n\nDuring that time, he started his gym, began running events, and has seen increased participation and attendance.\n\n\"Combat sports are having a little bit of a revival,\" he said.\n\n\"When I moved back to Mount Gambier, I was one of a handful of amateur boxers. Now we've got 20-odd getting ready to fight out of the gym.\"\n\nDwyer said the motivations behind people taking up the sport varied, with some never intending to get hit.\n\n\"All of our technical and general classes are non-contact, so there's a lot of people that do it just for the fitness and community side,\" he said.\n\n\"Probably 75 per cent of our gym members are just here for fitness.\"\n\nSam Dwyer also trains other fighters in Mount Gambier. (Supplied: Dwyer's Boxing Promotions)\n\nSub-concussive blows add up\n\nProfessor Purnell said that as the popularity of combat sports had grown in recent years, so had the knowledge about the impact on the brain.\n\n\"We've got a brain that floats in fluid \u2026 it's really got the consistency of soft butter,\" he said.\n\n\"Even if a knock to the head doesn't cause concussion, it can contribute to long-term brain changes, especially in young athletes where their brains are still developing.\"\n\nProfessor Purnell said the sub-concussive blows could add up, causing symptoms such as mood changes, brain fogginess, irritability and more.\n\nDwyer said that while he had so far avoided issues with head injuries, many boxers had changed the way they train.\n\n\"Back when I started, we'd do a lot more sparring than we do now,\" he said.\n\n\"We do a lot more skill work and the sparring we do, unless we're coming into comp, is very light.\n\n\" But I think it really boils down to it's a contact sport and to some degree we have to accept the risk. \"\n\nDwyer has been boxing for more than a decade. (Supplied: Dwyer's Boxing Promotions)\n\nMaking sports 'smarter' on head injuries\n\nProfessor Purnell said it would be impossible to remove head contact from sports where it was ingrained in the culture, such as combat sports.\n\nBut he said administrators needed to look at ways to minimise risks across all sports.\n\n\"We're smart about when we get in a car that we wear our seatbelt,\" he said.\n\n\"So what can we do, whether it's soccer or hockey or netball or whatever, to reduce the possibility of it occurring and then to help if and when it does?\" he said.\n\nBeyond the sports themselves, Professor Purnell said the \"magic four\" elements of connectedness with other people, good nutrition, decent sleep and exercise could help maintain a healthy brain.\n\n\"If you're in that period where you've had a few of these knocks, but you do these things, they help to mitigate against some of those more adverse impacts,\" he said.\n\n\"The moment something starts to interfere with your daily life, you know that's when you really need to take some action to reduce that.\"",

    "text": "\u201cOver the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlements spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat. \u201cIn turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government\u2019s debt and interest burden higher. The US fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns.\u201d US government debt has ballooned over the past decade. US debt is ballooning. Credit: Bloomberg It was just under $US20 trillion when Donald Trump first took office but had swollen to $US27.7 trillion by the start of the Biden administration, with Trump\u2019s 2017 $US4.5 trillion \u201cTax and Jobs Act\u201d the major influence.\n\nIt is now $US36.2 trillion, thanks to Biden\u2019s massive spending on climate-related concessions, infrastructure spending and his CHIPS and Science Act. In March, the Congressional Budget Office released its projections for US debt and deficits, saying the deficit would reduce from last year\u2019s 6.4 per cent of GDP to 6.1 per cent over the next decade. Debt would, however, rise from 98 per cent of GDP in 2024 to 118 per cent in 2035. More recently, it has factored in the One, Big, Beautiful Bill. That would, it says, increase annual deficits from $US1.9 trillion to $US2.9 trillion in 2034, or 6.9 per cent of GDP, or potentially as much as $US3.3 trillion and 7.8 per cent of GDP if some measures in the bill, which are scheduled to expire at the end of Trump\u2019s term, were to be made permanent. (Some of the \u201ctemporary\u201d measures are only temporary to try to make the bill look less profligate, while others look like an inducement for his supporters while he is in office, with their expiry his successor\u2019s problem).\n\nDebt would increase by $US3.3 trillion by 2034 \u2013 $US5.2 trillion if the spending measures were made permanent \u2013 or to 125 per cent of GDP (129 per cent if permanent). Annual interest costs would rise between $US1.8 trillion (4.2 per cent of GDP) and $US1.9 trillion (4.4 per cent of GDP). In other words, this big, beautiful bill would take a fiscal position which, in any economy without America\u2019s privileged position would already be unsustainable, and make it worse. Trump\u2019s aggressive policies have hurt the US dollar. Moreover, given that Trump\u2019s tax package is highly regressive \u2013 the wealthy would continue to benefit significantly while lower income households see little or no benefit \u2013 it would exacerbate inequality. Moody\u2019s, while cutting America\u2019s rating, awarded the US a stable outlook because of a history of effective monetary policy led by an independent Federal Reserve, the constitutional separation of powers and America\u2019s unique status and the world\u2019s dominant reserve currency provider.\n\nThose attributes are being tested by the current administration. Loading Trump has routinely slammed the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, threatened to sack Powell (until the markets\u2019 reactions caused him to back off) and is expected to insert his own nominees into the Fed at every available opportunity. He would subvert the Fed\u2019s independence if he thought financial markets would let him. With Trump effectively ignoring Congress and governing via executive orders, many of which have dubious legal or constitutional authority, and disregarding Supreme Court orders on immigration, the separation of powers doctrine in the US is being tested by his administration. The US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, but it has depreciated by more than 8 per cent against a basket of its major trading partners\u2019 currencies and there have been indications of capital outflows, or at least reduced inflows, as a result of Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies.\n\nWhile financial markets have calmed since Trump announced 90-day pauses of his proposed \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs and his 145 per cent tariff on imports on China was reduced (temporarily?) to 30 per cent, before those stays there was a strong \u201csell America\u201d mood among foreign investors. Given that Trump\u2019s tax package is highly regressive \u2013 the wealthy would continue to benefit significantly while lower income households see little or no benefit \u2013 it would exacerbate inequality. When the 90-day pauses end the administration is now saying it will replace its \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which were supposed to be negotiated trade deals, with unilateral tariffs. \u201cI own the store (the US economy) and I set prices,\u201d Trump has said. The tariffs, their impact on the US economy and their impact on America\u2019s trade partners have the potential to be highly disruptive and negative for the US and the rest the world.\n\nThey risk a self-induced recession in the US (and deficits and debt that are an even higher proportion of GDP as a consequence) while slowing growth around the world. They also place a questionmark over something of longer-term consequence than the short-term ebbs and flows in economic activity in the US and elsewhere. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d unilateralism, and his economic illiteracy, has unsettled allies and the investors needed to buy the swelling tide of government debt that the US is already issuing even before the effects of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill start flowing. If Trump\u2019s trade war were to cause more capital to flow out of the US than flows in, initially it would result in higher interest costs and bigger deficits and debt than would already be the case. Longer term it could undermine the reserve currency status of the dollar, which is America\u2019s greatest financial asset. It helps prevent the US from experiencing the external pressures and the risk of a financial crisis that any other economy with its deteriorating fiscal outlook would be facing.",

It\u2019s crazy.\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"What did you want the audience to feel while watching you sing?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJJ: \"I wanted to let them have an insight on my deepest soul, how I felt when we wrote the song. And I\u2019m so, so, so happy that, you know, everyone has been resonating with this\u2026 And what I\u2019m trying to permit is that there\u2019s no wasted love. Love is never wasted. There\u2019s so much love that we can spread around, and we should use love. It\u2019s the strongest force on planet Earth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJJ now joins Austria\u2019s elite circle of Eurovision winners, following Conchita Wurst in 2014 and Udo Jurgens in 1966.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis win comes a year after Switzerland\u2019s Nemo claimed the crown in Malm\u00f6, granting Basel the right to host this year\u2019s contest.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 160 million people tuned in worldwide, while 100,000 fans attended events across the host city.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them were enthusiastic supporters of the 37 countries competing, and a visible wave of protesters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Sydney suburb of Hurstville, scores of fans, many dressed in the traditional garb of the countries they either came from or were rooting for, gathered at 5am to watch the performance live on SBS.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them was this man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's been an amazing morning, it's been chaotic but fun and frenzied, you know, we just had, Finland and she went off. Everyone got up dancing to Estonia and Austria. It's been a great morning already so far.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked by SBS why he thought Australia loved Eurovision so much, he replied:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's because it's a safe and inclusive space for people, you know, it brings together people of different cultures, different languages. We're all united through music, and it's that celebration and cultural expression that I think everyone just loves and the fun and all the colour and excitement of Eurovision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Eurovision brands itself as politically neutral, tensions surrounding Israel\u2019s participation cast a shadow over the festivities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s entrant this year, Yuval Raphael, is a survivor of the Hamas attack on the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023, an attack which killed 1,200 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Raphael\u2019s performance earned Israel second place overall, with strong backing from Australia\u2019s public vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the country\u2019s involvement stirred controversy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the war in Gaza continues, pro-Palestinian groups called for Israel\u2019s exclusion, pointing to the precedent set in 2022 when Russia was barred after invading Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 200 protesters gathered outside the venue on the night of the final, where scuffles broke out between police and protesters over Israel's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest final.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them was Sebastian Piery from France.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because I have the impression that Israel is using this as a showcase to clear itself of what's happening, to show that... Yes, it's a nation open to the world, gay-friendly. And so am I, but I don't think we can justify that. And to do what's happening on the other side, that's not OK.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the venue, the political atmosphere rippled into the broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish public broadcaster RTVE aired a message ahead of the show, stating: \u201cWhen human rights are at stake, silence is not an option. Peace and justice for Palestine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the calls for boycott, Israel competed, and nearly won.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack on the scoreboard, Estonia placed third with its catchy caffeine-fuelled track Espresso Macchiato.\n\n\n\n\n\nJury favourites France, Italy, and Switzerland saw their high marks from experts undone by lukewarm audience votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne surprise came from Sweden\u2019s comedy trio KAJ, favourites going into the competition with a humorous song about saunas.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the buzz, they didn\u2019t crack the top three.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, it was a disappointing night for the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\nGirl group Remember Monday ended in 19th place, earning zero points from the public, echoing last year\u2019s result when Olly Alexander landed in 18th.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for JJ, it was a moment of transcendence.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis message, he says, was always about love.\n\n\n\n",

You might need to prepare differently \u2014 as this time, it may not be a human deciding your fate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, 43 per cent of Australian organisations used Artificial Intelligence (AI) \"moderately\" in their recruitment, while 19 per cent used it \"extensively\" when hiring new staff, according to The Australian Responsible AI report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of technology in the hiring process can happen in different ways, such as by analysing CVs or evaluating applicants.\n\n\n\n'Confronting' interview with AI\n\nBut nowadays, AI can be used more directly in the process through so-called \"robo-interviews\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne-based social enterprise, Sisterworks, experienced this late in 2024, when a group of its graduates found themselves in a situation neither they nor their teachers had prepared for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We actually got caught on surprise, when towards the end of last year, we sent about nine sisters to an interview and they didn't make it, they didn't pass the interview,\" The group's CEO, Ifrin Fittock, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We found out that they're actually not being interviewed face to face, but actually being interviewed by videos slash AI interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think they just fail because they don't know what to do.\"\n\n\n\nSisterworks has been helping migrant and refugee women enter the workforce for more than a decade, and their recent experience with AI is not unique, with job seekers increasingly sharing similar experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobo-interviews are essentially interviews where a candidate is assessed by an AI system instead of a human. Typically, candidates record themselves and answer a series of questions, which are then evaluated by AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of technology in recruitment is often praised for its potential to save both time and money, but there are concerns that this type of hiring process can create new barriers for migrants and refugees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenges with these AI recruitment or AI interview for some of our sisters is really, first of all, English is not their first language, but also the level of digital literacy that they may or may not have,\" Fittock said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's all really quite confronting.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Should artificial intelligence be used in job recruitment? SBS News 17/05/2025 06:18 Play\n\nConcerns about 'discrimination'\n\nThese are not the only existing concerns about AI hiring systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way that these systems operate \"creates serious risks of algorithm-facilitated discrimination\", according to a study published by the Law School at the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nNatalie Sheard, who led the study, told SBS News: \"In my research I heard of systems not being accessible to job seekers with disabilities, heard of CV screening systems using things like gaps in employment history to screen candidates out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having a gap in your employment history is a well-known proxy for gender as women tend to have time out of the workforce to care for family, parents, children.\"\n\n\n\nPrevious reports indicate that the new hiring process might discriminate against applicants wearing headscarves, individuals with disabilities, and women.\n\n\n\n\n\nSheard's research also highlights the issue around data sets and algorithms for the AI models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these systems are built overseas, so they might've been trained on data on populations that aren't comparable to the Australian population,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The system won't perform as well for particular demographic groups that we have in Australia. For example, refugees, migrant women, First Nations ...\"\n\n\n\nThere are benefits too\n\nAndreas Leibbrandt, a professor at Monash University, has also researched the role of AI in recruitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there are benefits to the technology, and if deployed correctly, a system can be less biased than a human.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one study, conducted in the US, he found women and non-anglo candidates are more likely to apply for a job if they know AI tools are being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not that both women or ethnic minorities feel there's no bias in the AI algorithm, but they feel that this bias is less so than when they're faced with a human recruiter,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn the same time, he is concerned about a lack of transparency, regulation, and potential bias built into algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These AI algorithms are fed with training data sets or data sets from corporations. But their training data in itself may be biased. It may come from an organisation where there was, for instance, [a] bias against women,\" Leibbrandt said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it remains uncertain whether AI hiring systems reduce bias or reinforce discrimination, applicants from various backgrounds appear to be adapting.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo interview training is now part of the Sisterworks job course, and Fatemeh Zahra Hazrati, originally from Iran, is among those taking part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" AI has [a] real big effect on our lives nowadays,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All of us have to learn it, [and we] just need to adapt ourselves for new things and accept challenges to learn new things.\"\n\n\n\n",

Let's spread more love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is beyond my wildest dreams. It's crazy.\"\n\n\n\nWinner of the Eurovision Song Contest JJ from Austria holds up the trophy onstage he won with the song Wasted Love. Source: AP / Martin Meissner His performance was filmed in black and white, in the 4:3 ratio of the monochrome television era.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the third time Austria has won Eurovision, with Udo J\u00fcrgens taking home the top spot in 1965 and Conchita Wurst in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When JJ sings, it's as if time stops,\" Wurst said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the two performers released a duet, while JJ said Wurst provided \"many tips\" ahead of Saturday's contest.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribed by Eurovision as \"A countertenor with a distinctive voice that can reach soprano heights\", the Austrian-Filipino artist's music is classical meets club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My song is about my personal experience with wasted and unreciprocated love. I had too much love to put out there; not much came back,\" he told Agence France-Presse during Eurovision week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe singer has set his sights on a blend known as operatic pop, a \"cross-genre and cross-disciplinary approach (which) demonstrates exceptional versatility and innovative strength\", said Andreas Mailath-Pokorny, rector at Vienna arts and music university MUK, where JJ studies.\n\n\n\nWho is JJ?\n\nJJ, whose real name is Johannes Pietsch, was born in Vienna in 2001 \u2014 his father is an IT specialist, and his mother is a Filipino chef.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe got a taste for classical music from his father, especially for Bach and Mozart, while his mother listened to Celine Dion and Whitney Houston.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was raised in Dubai, where karaoke parties and his father first introduced him to pop and opera.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Vienna, he later uncovered classical music, refining his skills through talent shows and minor opera roles before Eurovision.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe speaks German, English and Tagalog and has learned Arabic and French.\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview with The Independent, he said that he was \"surrounded by music\" growing up and started singing at a young age.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those following The Voice UK music contest, he should seem familiar as he participated in the ninth series in 2020 and reached the finals alongside his coach, William James Adams, also known as will.i.am.\n\n\n\nHow was the winner chosen?\n\nAn estimated 160 million people across Europe and beyond were expected to tune in for the annual TV spectacle, where kitsch, glam and spectacular staging go hand in hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the grand final, JJ triumphed over 25 competitors, with performers from 37 nations participating in Eurovision 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparate jury and viewer votes from each of this year's participating countries -- with equal weight -- plus an extra vote from the rest of the world combined, decided who won the coveted microphone-shaped trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria earned 178 points from the audience and 257 from the jury, taking them to 435 points in total.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael came in second place with 357 points. They also topped the Australian public vote.\n\n\n\nAfter a surge in audience votes, Estonia came in third with 356 points for their coffee bop, Espresso Macchiato.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe favourites coming into the competition were Sweden's KAJ, with their catchy tune about heading to the sauna, Bara Bada Bastu.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut they faded away as the votes came in, finishing fourth ahead of Italy, Greece and France.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland, France and Italy dominated jury votes but fell short in praise from the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\nEleven were knocked out by public voting in the semi-finals, including Australia's Go-Jo Marty Zambotto, with his tongue-in-cheek Milkshake Man.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Additional reporting by Agence France-Presse.\n\n\n\n",

So it's all really quite confronting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, 43 percent of organisations use AI \"moderately\" in their recruitment, while 19 per cent use the technology \"extensively\" when hiring new staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's according to The Australian Responsible AI report, which details how Australian businesses are tracking when it comes to AI practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs employers increasingly embrace AI, video interview training is now part of the Sisterworks job course.\n\n\n\n\n\nFatemeh Hazrati - originally from Iran - is among those currently taking part in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AI has real big effect on our life nowadays. All of us have to learn it, [and] [We] just need to adapt ourself for new things and accept challenges to learn new things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAI in recruitment is often touted for its ability to save both time and money.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there are mounting concerns around its potential to discriminate.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Natalie Sheard is from the Melbourne Law School at the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe led a study published earlier this month that suggests AI hiring systems are creating new barriers to employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it could be older applicants, women, people who speak English as a second language, job seekers with disabilities. In my research I heard of systems not being accessible to job seekers with disabilities. I heard of CV screening systems using things like gaps in employment history to screen candidates out and having a gap in your employment history is a well-known proxy for gender as women tend to have time out of the workforce to care for family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also explains how those with English as a second language can be disadvantaged in video interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Another concern is that the way these systems tend to operate is the AI doesn't assess the video. What happens is the audio from your video is transcribed and then AI is used to evaluate your answer and it's well established that those transcription services perform poorly for people who speak English as a second language or have accents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMonash University's Professor Andreas Leibbrandt has also researched the role of AI in recruitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there are benefits to the technology, and if deployed correctly, a system can be less bias than a human.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one study, conducted in the US, he found women and non-anglo candidates are more likely to apply for a job if they know AI tools are being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not that both women or ethnic minorities feel there's no bias in the AI algorithm, but they feel that this bias is less so than when they're faced with a human recruiter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he's concerned by a lack of transparency, regulation and potential bias built into algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These AI algorithm are fed with training data sets or data sets from corporations.

And therefore again, the system won't perform as well for particular demographic groups that we have in Australia. For example, refugees, migrant women, first Nations, Australians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are growing calls for the Australian government to better regulate the use of AI in recruitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Hunter, is the CEO of Diversity Council Australia - the independent not-for-profit peak body leading diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With such high adoption rates and the rapid acceleration of the technology, we're just concerned that people aren't putting in place the proper considerations around ethical use.\"\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied Katrina Ebril is the Interoperability Lead with the Australian e-Health research centre at the CSIRO and says this change is a first when it comes to women's bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's definitely time to change ... and we do this for other procedures,\" Ebril said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a uterectomy, let's call it what it is, and start to use that much more positive language and much more language that aligns to what the actual procedure is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor women like Watts, removing taboos around menstruation is key to making treatment more accessible, and encouraging others to seek help.\n\n\n\nWho suffers from heavy menstrual bleeding?\n\nOne in four people who menstruate suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding, according to the ACSQHC, and two thirds of those experience iron deficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet the commission notes less than half of women suffering from the condition visit a doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Traditionally or historically, women have been left out of research, and sometimes even the animals in the labs were male animals,\" Uppal said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And so this is a long historical background of disadvantage of not including women, and we really want to change that narrative when it comes to heavy bleeding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUppal welcomes a number of measures in the federal government's multi-million dollar investment in women's health , but would like to see more attention given to this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's just part of that silence around heavy menstrual bleeding ... and I don't think it's deliberate, I feel it's just a culture where it's not front of mind,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWatt believes a lack of awareness is why she struggled to receive adequate care for months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just been so normalised ... and I don't think it should be, I don't think it's normal,\" Watt said. \"And it's really hard to get any information because it's just taken as: 'Well, you're a woman, this is what happens.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe can't imagine what her life would have looked like without undergoing the procedure, now relishing the active lifestyle she was once forced to sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My ability to participate in skiing, running, swimming ... all of the things that I wanted to enjoy, that's all possible again, I never have to worry about that ever again, it's like an absolute new lease of life,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about medical misogyny and discrimination in our health system by listening to the podcast series 'Hysterical' by SBS News .\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "A polio outbreak has been declared in Papua New Guinea, sparking concern about the disease's spread in a country with low vaccination rates, health officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious and potentially fatal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can cause deformities and paralysis, and mainly affects children under five years old.\n\n\n\nIn some remote villages in PNG polio vaccination rates are thought to be as low as 7 per cent. Source: AAP / Brendan Esposito The virus was detected in wastewater and environmental samples in the Pacific nation's capital Port Moresby and second-largest city Lae, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn subsequent testing, two children in Lae were found to have the poliovirus type 2 strain, according to the WHO representative in Papua New Guinea, Sevil Huseynova.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe confirmation of community transmission in the children \"constitutes a polio outbreak\", Huseynova said in briefing notes provided to AFP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Polio is a highly infectious disease, and in communities with low polio immunisation rates, the virus quickly spreads from one person to another,\" Huseynova said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe health agency \"expresses deep concern over the confirmed outbreak\", she said.\n\n\n\nDr Matt Mason is a lecturer in nursing in the School of Health, Centre for Pacific Islands Research at the University of the Sunshine Coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said with only 47 per cent of PNG children fully immunised, and some districts reporting coverage as low as 8 per cent, \"pockets of extreme vulnerability exist\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Infection prevention and control must begin at the community level. Strengthening water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure in both urban settlements and remote villages is essential to curb faecal\u2013oral spread.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe recommended health authorities collaborate with trusted partners, such as churches and women\u2019s groups, to disseminate hygiene kits and promote hand\u2011hygiene stations at schools, markets, and health services.\n\n\n\nTracing PNG's polio outbreak\n\nGenetic testing showed the polio strain detected in Papua New Guinea was linked to one circulating in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n\nPapua New Guinea was certified as polio-free in 2000, but immunisation rates among children are low.\n\n\n\n\n\nPapua New Guinea health minister Elias Kapavore said the situation was \"serious but manageable\".\n\n\n\n\"We've dealt with this before and know what works,\" he told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Vaccination is safe and effective, and we're acting quickly to keep children protected.\"\n\n\n\nIs there a risk of polio spreading to Australia?\n\nAustralia has been polio-free since 2000 and hasn't had a major outbreak of the disease since 1961. Children are routinely vaccinated against the illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Yong Gao (Nias) Peng is a CSIRO early research career fellow at CSIRO Health and Biosecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While the risk of polio spreading to Australia is considered low due to high vaccination rates and robust public health infrastructure, it is recommended that travellers to PNG ensure their polio vaccinations are up to date,\" Peng says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Continued surveillance for poliovirus and support for PNG's immunisation efforts are crucial to contain the outbreak and prevent international spread.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\u201cOver the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlements spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat. \u201cIn turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government\u2019s debt and interest burden higher. The US fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns.\u201d US government debt has ballooned over the past decade. US debt is ballooning. Credit: Bloomberg It was just under $US20 trillion when Donald Trump first took office but had swollen to $US27.7 trillion by the start of the Biden administration, with Trump\u2019s 2017 $US4.5 trillion \u201cTax and Jobs Act\u201d the major influence.\n\nIt is now $US36.2 trillion, thanks to Biden\u2019s massive spending on climate-related concessions, infrastructure spending and his CHIPS and Science Act. In March, the Congressional Budget Office released its projections for US debt and deficits, saying the deficit would reduce from last year\u2019s 6.4 per cent of GDP to 6.1 per cent over the next decade. Debt would, however, rise from 98 per cent of GDP in 2024 to 118 per cent in 2035. More recently, it has factored in the One, Big, Beautiful Bill. That would, it says, increase annual deficits from $US1.9 trillion to $US2.9 trillion in 2034, or 6.9 per cent of GDP, or potentially as much as $US3.3 trillion and 7.8 per cent of GDP if some measures in the bill, which are scheduled to expire at the end of Trump\u2019s term, were to be made permanent. (Some of the \u201ctemporary\u201d measures are only temporary to try to make the bill look less profligate, while others look like an inducement for his supporters while he is in office, with their expiry his successor\u2019s problem).\n\nDebt would increase by $US3.3 trillion by 2034 \u2013 $US5.2 trillion if the spending measures were made permanent \u2013 or to 125 per cent of GDP (129 per cent if permanent). Annual interest costs would rise between $US1.8 trillion (4.2 per cent of GDP) and $US1.9 trillion (4.4 per cent of GDP). In other words, this big, beautiful bill would take a fiscal position which, in any economy without America\u2019s privileged position would already be unsustainable, and make it worse. Trump\u2019s aggressive policies have hurt the US dollar. Moreover, given that Trump\u2019s tax package is highly regressive \u2013 the wealthy would continue to benefit significantly while lower income households see little or no benefit \u2013 it would exacerbate inequality. Moody\u2019s, while cutting America\u2019s rating, awarded the US a stable outlook because of a history of effective monetary policy led by an independent Federal Reserve, the constitutional separation of powers and America\u2019s unique status and the world\u2019s dominant reserve currency provider.\n\nThose attributes are being tested by the current administration. Loading Trump has routinely slammed the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, threatened to sack Powell (until the markets\u2019 reactions caused him to back off) and is expected to insert his own nominees into the Fed at every available opportunity. He would subvert the Fed\u2019s independence if he thought financial markets would let him. With Trump effectively ignoring Congress and governing via executive orders, many of which have dubious legal or constitutional authority, and disregarding Supreme Court orders on immigration, the separation of powers doctrine in the US is being tested by his administration. The US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, but it has depreciated by more than 8 per cent against a basket of its major trading partners\u2019 currencies and there have been indications of capital outflows, or at least reduced inflows, as a result of Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies.\n\nWhile financial markets have calmed since Trump announced 90-day pauses of his proposed \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs and his 145 per cent tariff on imports on China was reduced (temporarily?) to 30 per cent, before those stays there was a strong \u201csell America\u201d mood among foreign investors. Given that Trump\u2019s tax package is highly regressive \u2013 the wealthy would continue to benefit significantly while lower income households see little or no benefit \u2013 it would exacerbate inequality. When the 90-day pauses end the administration is now saying it will replace its \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which were supposed to be negotiated trade deals, with unilateral tariffs. \u201cI own the store (the US economy) and I set prices,\u201d Trump has said. The tariffs, their impact on the US economy and their impact on America\u2019s trade partners have the potential to be highly disruptive and negative for the US and the rest the world.\n\nThey risk a self-induced recession in the US (and deficits and debt that are an even higher proportion of GDP as a consequence) while slowing growth around the world. They also place a questionmark over something of longer-term consequence than the short-term ebbs and flows in economic activity in the US and elsewhere. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d unilateralism, and his economic illiteracy, has unsettled allies and the investors needed to buy the swelling tide of government debt that the US is already issuing even before the effects of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill start flowing. If Trump\u2019s trade war were to cause more capital to flow out of the US than flows in, initially it would result in higher interest costs and bigger deficits and debt than would already be the case. Longer term it could undermine the reserve currency status of the dollar, which is America\u2019s greatest financial asset. It helps prevent the US from experiencing the external pressures and the risk of a financial crisis that any other economy with its deteriorating fiscal outlook would be facing.",

    "text": "Recent fish deaths across Tasmania, along with similar events on the Asssie coastline, suggest a concerning trend that may point to broader environmental stress in Australian waters.\n\nHundreds of fish, believed to be sardines or pilchards, have washed ashore along the River Derwent in Tasmania. Source: Lisa Hollister/Pulse\n\n\"Disturbed\" locals have reported that hundreds \u2014 and possibly thousands \u2014 of small dead fish are washing up ashore along a popular Australian waterway in the country's south.\n\nNumerous dead fish have been spotted floating along the River Derwent in Tasmania over the weekend, sparking an investigation by environmental authorities.\n\nThe fish, believed to be pilchards or sardines, were seen strewn along the water and beaches between Crayfish Point in Taroona and Long Beach in Sandy Bay on Saturday. The sight alarmed local residents, many of whom shared their concern on social media.\n\nPilchard orthomyxovirus (POMV) was detected in samples collected over the weekend by Biosecurity Tasmania and the Environment Protection Authority (EPA). Source: Lisa Hollister/Pulse\n\nWhy are fish appearing dead in Tasmania?\n\nInitial testing by Biosecurity Tasmania and the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) detected the presence of pilchard orthomyxovirus (POMV) \u2014 a virus known to naturally occur in several fish species found in Tasmanian waters \u2014 in samples collected over the weekend, Pulse Tasmania reported.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe virus belongs to the same broader family as influenza but only infects aquatic species, with Atlantic salmon and Australian pilchards being particularly vulnerable.\n\nWhile it often exists in the environment without causing major issues, outbreaks can occur when fish are stressed due to environmental factors like warm water temperatures, low oxygen levels, or handling. These outbreaks can lead to symptoms such as lethargy, unusual swimming behaviour, reduced appetite, and, in severe cases, large-scale fish deaths.\n\nIn recent months, mass fish deaths have been reported along Australia's coast. In March 2025, thousands of juvenile leatherjacket fish washed up on beaches stretching over 300 kilometres from Stanwell Park to Bermagui in New South Wales.\n\nSimilarly, in South East Queensland, reports emerged of leatherjacket fish washing ashore, with environmental factors such as changes in water temperature, pollution, or natural events like ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred potentially contributing to the strandings.\n\nIn South Australia, a toxic algae outbreak was responsible for the deaths of numerous marine life. Among them were different species of fish, octopus and cockles (also known as pipis).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania confirmed that tests for illnesses typically associated with farmed salmon, including Tasmanian rickettsia-like organism (TRLO) and P. salmonis, returned negative results.\n\nWhile the current fish kill appears to be localised, further testing is now underway to determine whether other contributing factors may be involved. Officials are also monitoring nearby marine environments to assess the potential impact on other species.\n\nEnvironmental scientists said it's still unclear whether the event was an isolated incident or could indicate deeper ecological issues within the Derwent Estuary.\n\nDead salmon wash up due to farm bacterial infection\n\nIn early 2025, Tasmania experienced a significant environmental crisis as large numbers of dead salmon and oily fish waste began washing up on beaches in the state's southeast, including Verona Sands and Bruny Island.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese incidents were linked to a mass mortality event in nearby salmon farms, where over 5,500 tonnes of fish died in February alone\u2014approximately six per cent of the industry's annual production.\n\nThe primary cause of the die-off was an outbreak of Piscirickettsia salmonis, a bacterial infection exacerbated by rising water temperatures. As the infected fish decomposed, congealed fish oil and fatty, \"foul-smelling\" deposits formed, which then drifted ashore.\n\nPreliminary testing by the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) confirmed that these greasy \"chunks\" were composed of fish oil mixed with sand.\n\nDespite the decline in fish deaths, the incident has raised ongoing concerns about the sustainability and environmental impact of salmon farming in Tasmania. Calls for increased transparency and stricter oversight continue as the community seeks to prevent similar events in the future.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "While most Australians are familiar with the country's iconic red dirt, some may never have heard of this 'slippery' soil.\n\nWhen reflecting on Australia\u2019s iconic landscape, it\u2019s hard not to picture the distinct dusty, red dirt that stretches across the centre of the lucky country. However, that might not be the case for everyone, with a lesser-known \u201csketchy\u201d soil creating big problems at caravan parks and campsites, leaving some travellers \u201cbogged for days\u201d.\n\nWhen Aaron Schubert, 35, his wife and their two young sons hit the road to embark on a two-year lap of Australia, the dad told Yahoo he was pretty familiar with the \u201cclay mud\u201d often seen in his home state of WA. But as the family trekked further north and along the coast to Queensland, they were shocked by the stark difference in the dirt beneath their feet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a ridiculous amount of 4WDing and black soil was fairly new to us, but it blew me away with how sketchy things can get,\u201d Schubert, who has shared tips about caravanning and camping on his website for 15 years.\n\nThe 35-year-old said he was 'quite taken aback as to how slippery' the clay soil is. Source: Aaron Schubert/Supplied\n\nBlack soil, otherwise referred to as a vertosol, is Australia\u2019s most fertile soil and can be found largely across Queensland and NSW, especially in agricultural areas. While it is prime for produce, the cracking clay soil can get \u201creally sticky\u201d and soft when wet, former president of Soil Science Australia Dr Vanessa Wong told Yahoo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnsurprisingly, this has landed numerous campers in quite a pickle, with Schubert saying it\u2019s \u201cvery easy for people to get caught out\u201d. \u201cI was quite taken aback as to how slippery it was on a number of occasions in Cape York,\u201d he added.\n\nCaravanners 'bogged for days' at Queensland campsites\n\nOne morning, while staying at a caravan park in Karumba, a coastal town in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Schubert told Yahoo he awoke to find some cars \u201cstuck at the bottom\u201d and wandered down to see what was going on.\n\n\u201cI nearly stacked it in my thongs. You don\u2019t even have to sink into [black soil]. There\u2019s just zero traction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went to another campsite not long after and there were cars that were bogged for five or six days. They just had to wait for it all to dry out.\u201d\n\nIn nearby Normanton, Schubert popped into the visitors centre and learned multiple campers had gotten stuck near a river after ignoring a warning to move before the rain set in.\n\nSchubert said he came across several travellers who were stranded for days after getting bogged in black soil. Source: Aaron Schubert/Supplied\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d rung up asking for recoveries, with some people saying their van started sliding towards the river at night when the rain hit. If you imagine the slipperiest stuff you can stand on, black soil is pretty similar!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s black soil on the surface and it rains, that's it \u2014 you\u2019re in big trouble.\u201d\n\nSchubert, who returned home to Perth late last year, said his family avoided getting bogged by being \u201cpretty cautious\u201d and consistently keeping an eye on the weather.\n\n\u201cI think that applies in general to 4WDing. You don\u2019t want to be at the top or bottom of a mountain if it\u2019s gonna rain because you it doesn\u2019t have to be black soil for you to end up in a world of pain.\u201d\n\nAustralia has the largest variety of shrink/swell soils. Source: TERN Australian Soil Classification Map\n\nWhat is black soil?\n\nIn Australia, there are several kinds of vertosols \u2014 black soil is just one of them, Dr Wong said. It shrinks and swells depending on whether it\u2019s wet or dry, with some farmers reporting losing entire fence posts in the soil\u2019s large cracks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cClay soils can be found all over the world but Australia has the largest variety of these shrink/swell soils \u2014 it\u2019s one of the really neat things about the Aussie landscape. They also make up a large area relative to our land mass which is probably why people keep coming across them,\u201d Dr Wong told Yahoo.\n\n\u201cThese soils can be quite deep so once you get stuck in them they get really, really sticky because of the clay contents. There\u2019s nothing underneath to stop you from sinking.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "The striking campaign aims to de-stigmatise the conversation around suicide, which is the leading cause of death for Australians aged 15 to 49.\n\nScenes like this are popping up all over Australia. Source: Supplied\n\nAustralia\u2019s mental health crisis is one many have experienced firsthand, and now a striking campaign is aiming to help spark important conversations in a visible and unexpected way.\n\nThe Blue Tree Project is a national initiative that encourages communities to paint dead trees blue as a visual reminder to reduce stigma around mental health and suicide. Launched in Western Australia in 2019, the grassroots movement has since grown into a global symbol of support and awareness.\n\nIn the ACT, the project is backed by the territory government, which recently called on locals to \"start important discussions that could make a real difference\". Last Thursday, the Office for Mental Health and Wellbeing hosted a tree-painting event in Acton to launch Canberra\u2019s Tree Week.\n\n\"Openly talking about mental health can reduce stigma, shift outdated attitudes, and create safer spaces where people can seek help without judgment,\" said Gabrielle from the Office for Mental Health and Wellbeing. \"It\u2019s great to see so many people come together to create a more open, supportive community where mental health is recognised and talked about.\"\n\nIn the ACT, the Blue Tree Project is backed by the territory government. Source: ACT Government\n\nThe ACT Government said the initiative is successfully sparking the kinds of mental health conversations it set out to promote. \"When someone asks \u2018Why is that tree blue?\u2019 it can lead to meaningful discussions that help reduce stigma,\" a spokesperson told Yahoo News, adding that the aim is to create \"safer spaces where people can seek help without fear of judgment.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey said the community response has been \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d, with feedback coming from a diverse range of Canberrans \u2014 including students, tradespeople, public servants, and retail workers. \"Many have said the trees offer a sense of connection, visibility, and hope, reminding people they are not alone in their mental health journey.\"\n\nThere are currently several Blue Trees across the ACT, including three painted by the government in Lyons, Holt and Acton, with more planned. The government said it continues \"to identify suitable locations for future trees\", and encourages the public to view the full list online.\n\nOnly non-living trees are painted, following environmental and cultural assessments. Trees are chosen for their visibility, and non-toxic paint is used to \"ensure environmental safety.\"\n\nThe blue trees are meant as a symbol of the largely hidden problem that continues to plague Australia. Source: Blue Tree Project/Facebook\n\nImportant truth behind unique campaign\n\nThe Blue Tree Project was founded by CEO Kendall Whyte, who started the organisation a year after losing her brother to suicide in 2018.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Like many initiatives, there will always be people who don't connect with our cause and mission,\" she previously told Yahoo. \"However, the support over the last six years has been overwhelmingly positive.\"\n\nWith suicide the leading cause of death for Australians aged 15 to 49, according to ABS data, the group now runs workshops and collaborates with corporate partners to better equip people to have difficult but vital conversations.\n\n\"Outdated attitudes are still deeply ingrained across Australia, which is preventing many from seeking support,\" Kendall said. \"Education is crucial, not only in shifting old attitudes, but also in upskilling ourselves to have the harder and more confronting conversations in life.\"\n\nThe idea of painting trees began with a joke her late brother once played by painting a tree on the family\u2019s Western Australian property to surprise their dad. Today, more than 1,300 registered blue trees \u2014 all dead trees known as stags \u2014 have become symbols of hope around the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"There is now a blue tree on every continent of the world \u2014 making us a global movement,\" Kendall said.\n\nReaders seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
