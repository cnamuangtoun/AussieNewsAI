(Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIf public sector employees \u2013 of which there are 365,400 working in federal government \u2013 can no longer work from home, who does this impact?\n\nAccording to analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics data from the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), one in three workers will be negatively affected by a blanket return to office order.\ufeff\n\nMore than 600,000 Australians work from home nationally in order to save money or avoid a commute, the ABS data shows.\n\nIf a large chunk of this widespread demographic gets back on the roads every morning and afternoon, traffic congestion will impact everyone, the ACTU said.\n\nMeanwhile, 320,000 of these workers say they need remote work for care responsibilities.\ufeff\n\nAnother one million Australian workers also report working from home in order to \"catch up\" on work after hours.\n\nThe ACTU said these workers will be forced to stay later at the office and will lose their \"right to disconnect\".\n\nThe ACTU said traffic congestion will be far worse under a policy like this.

    "text": "Australians can expect another significant boost to cost-of-living relief in tomorrow's federal budget as the government gears up for an election in May .\n\nWhile it had been presumed for months that an expected early election would get in the way of the budget, Tropical Cyclone Alfred delayed the calling of the vote , meaning Treasurer Jim Chalmers will have to hand down the national accounts as scheduled on March 25.\n\nBecause of that, there have been far fewer early announcements than in previous years, but the government has now revealed at least a few of the new measures it will be handing down this week.\n\nHere's what\ufeff you can expect tomorrow.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers is preparing to hand down the federal budget on March 25. (Polly Hanning/Nine)\n\nMajor bulk-billing boost and cheaper PBS medicines\n\nHealth \ufeffhas been a significant focus for the government in the lead-up to the next election, highlighted by two major policy announcements.\n\nThe first, unveiled in February, is an $8.5 billion boost for Medicare to expand bulk billing in a policy it says will deliver 18 million extra bulk-billed GP visits each year, saving Australians a combined $859 million a year by 2030.\n\nThe second, announced just days from the budget, is a $689 million pledge to reduce the maximum cost of a majority of medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), down from $31.60 to $25\ufeff.\n\nThat second announcement, which comes as US pharmaceutical giants lobby President Donald Trump to target the PBS in a new round of tariffs, will deliver Australians combined savings of $200 million a year, according to the government, and will start on January 1, 2026.\n\nBoth policies have been backed by the opposition, so will come into effect regardless of who wins the next election.\n\nMany medicines listed on the PBS will get cheaper from January 1, 2026. (Nine)\n\nEnergy bill relief\n\nThe centrepiece of last year's budget was the $3.5 billion in energy bill relief \u2013 an automatic $300 rebate, spread over the course of the financial year, for every household in the country, and that is, as expected, being extended this year.\n\nThe policy will now run through until the end of the year, providing all Australian households with a further\ufeff $150 off their power bills , at a cost of $1.8 billion.\n\nIt comes after the national energy regulator approved price increases of up to 9 per cent from July 1.\n\nAccording to Treasury estimates, the move will reduce headline inflation by around half a percentage point, and reduce household bills by 7.5 per cent on average nationally.\n\nWhile the opposition slammed the move as a \"desperate act\" and a \"Ponzi scheme\", it also promised to support the move so, once again, it will be implemented regardless of the election result.\n\nThe government says the extension of energy relief will reduce household bills by 7.5 per cent. (Luis Enrique Ascui/The Age)\n\nBoost for Australian-made goods as tariffs hit\n\nOne of the big economic uncertainties plaguing financial markets at the moment is US President Donald Trump's explosion of tariffs.\n\nAustralia has been hit by Trump's 25 per cent \ufefftax on all steel and aluminium imported into the United States, and while we shouldn't expect a retaliatory tariff in the budget \u2013 that was ruled out by Albanese \u2013 there's set to be some kind of response.\n\nLocal manufacturers fear a flood of cheap, international produce onto the Australian market from all the other nations that have also been denied free access to American consumers, which would be a significant business challenge.\n\nAlbanese has flagged support for local industry will be handed down.\n\n\"In the March budget, we'll provide additional support for our 'Buy Australian' campaign which we'll be announcing as part of the budget process,\" the prime minister said in his press conference responding to the introduction of Trump's tariffs.\n\nA couple of days later, he gave another hint on the topics.\n\n\"We have great products and as part of the budget in a couple of weeks' time, you'll see a spiced-up Made in Australia Plan\ufeff,\" he said.\n\nExpect to see incentives for Australians to buy locally made products after Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs. (AAP)\n\nA budget deficit\n\n\ufeffAfter two straight years of surpluses, the budget will return to the red in 2025.\n\n\ufeffThis has been flagged for quite some time; last year's surplus was always forecast to be followed by a return to deficit. (To put things into context, 2023 and 2024 are the only two surpluses Australia has recorded since 2008.)\n\nWhile we don't know what the exact figure will be, in December's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO), Treasury was forecasting a deficit of $26.9 billion in this year's budget.\n\nA week before budget day, Chalmers said that figure will be pretty close to the mark.\n\n\"Revenue upgrades have actually come off very significantly since the highs of October 2022,\" he said.\n\n\"Treasury doesn't expect the bottom line this year or over the forward estimates to change very substantially from MYEFO.\"\ufeff\n\nChalmers has flagged the deficit is likely to be in the mid-$20 billions. (Alex Ellinghausen/SMH)\n\nMassive student debt discount\n\nThe roughly 3 million Australians who have student debt will get a welcome boost on June 1 when \ufefftheir outstanding balances are cut by 20 per cent .\n\nThe one-off discount represents a massive $16 billion in student debt reduction \u2013 more than five times larger than last year's move to retrospectively lower the indexation applied to those debts.\n\nThe new measure was announced by the government as an election promise in November, and will now need to be included in this year's budget.\n\nAll Australians with student debt will get a big saving following the budget. (Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\nSubsidised childcare for everyone\ufeff\n\nLike\ufeff the student debt discount, this was an election promise unveiled in late 2024, well after the last budget: three days a week of subsidised childcare to families with a combined income of less than $530,000 a year.\n\nThe activity test will also be scrapped to make it easier for low-income parents to access cheaper childcare, a measure recommended by the Productivity Commission and long called for by economists.\n\nThe policy will come into effect on January 1, 2026, if Labor wins the federal election, and will cost $427 million over five years.\n\nAlbanese and Education Minister Jason Clare (right) unveiled the childcare changes last year. (Paul Jeffers/The Age)\n\nOther announcements \ufeff\n\nThere are a number of other policies that will form a part of the 2025 federal budget, including:\n\nA new $1 billion fund to build and expand early education centres\ufeff\n\n$1 billion \ufeffto reserve land for a future rail line linking Western Sydney Airport with south-west Sydney suburbs\n\n$30 million for the restoration of the Adass Israel Synagogue, which was firebombed last year, as well as a further $1.2 million for security upgrades.\ufeff\n\n$2.9 million to help grocery suppliers \"stand up\" to Woolworths and Coles.\n\nA $44.5 million boost for Australia's intelligence capabilities to implement the recommendations of an independent review.\n\n$800 million to expand the eligibility criteria for the Help to Buy shared equity housing scheme .\n\n\ufeff$54 million to boost the prefabricated home construction industry.",

    "text": "A weak and frail Pope Francis has returned home to the Vatican from the hospital after surviving a five-week, life-threatening bout of pneumonia, making a surprise stop at his favourite basilica on the way home before beginning two months of prescribed rest and recovery.\n\nThe motorcade carrying the 88-year-old pope entered the Perugino gate into Vatican City on Sunday morning (Sunday night AEDT), and Francis was seen in the front passenger seat wearing nasal tubes to give him supplemental oxygen.\n\nDuring the trip home from Gemelli hospital, Francis took a slight detour to bring him to the St Mary Major basilica, where his favourite icon of the Madonna is located and where he always goes to pray after a foreign visit. Francis didn't get out of the car, but handed a bouquet of flowers to the cardinal to place in front of the Salus populi Romani icon, a Byzantine-style painting on wood that is revered by Romans.\n\nPope Francis gestures as he appears at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, Sunday, March 23, 2025, where he has been treated for bronchitis and bilateral pneumonia since February 14. (AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)\n\n\ufeffBefore leaving the hospital, Francis gave a thumbs up and acknowledged the crowd after he was wheeled out onto the balcony overlooking the main entry. Hundreds of people had gathered on a brilliant Sunday morning to say goodbye.\n\n\"I see this woman with the yellow flowers. Brava!\" a tired and bloated-looking Francis said. He gave a weak sign of the cross before being wheeled back inside.\n\nChants of \"Viva il papa!\" and \"Papa Francesco\" erupted from the crowd, which included patients who had been wheeled outside just to catch his brief appearance.\n\nDoctors, who announced his planned release at a Saturday evening (early Sunday AEDT) news conference, said he needs two months of rest and convalescence, during which he should refrain from meeting with big groups of people or exerting himself. But they said eventually he should be able to resume all his normal activities.\n\nHis return home, after the longest hospitalisation of his 12-year papacy and the second-longest in recent papal history, brought tangible relief to the Vatican and Catholic faithful who have been anxiously following 38 days of medical ups and downs and wondering if Francis would make it.\n\n\"Today I feel a great joy,\" said Dr Rossella Russomando, a doctor from Salerno who didn't treat Francis but was at Gemelli on Sunday.\n\n\"It is the demonstration that all our prayers, all the rosary prayers from all over the world, brought this grace.\"\n\nPope Francis gestures as he appears at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, on Sunday, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)\n\nPope is happy to go home\n\nAt the Vatican on Sunday, pilgrims flocked as they have all year to St Peter's Basilica to participate in the 2025 Holy Year. They swarmed St Peter's Square and progressed through the Holy Door in groups, while big TV screens in the square were turned on to broadcast Francis' hospital greeting live.\n\nNo special arrangements have been made at the Domus Santa Marta, the Vatican hotel next to the basilica where Francis lives in a two-room suite on the second floor. Francis will have access to supplemental oxygen and 24-hour medical care as needed, though his personal physician, Dr Luigi Carbone, said he hoped Francis would progressively need less and less assistance breathing as his lungs recover.\n\nWhile the pneumonia infection has been successfully treated, Francis will continue to take oral medication for quite some time to treat the fungal infection in his lungs and continue his respiratory and physical physiotherapy.\n\n\"For three or four days he's been asking when he can go home, so he's very happy,\" Carbone said.\n\nFaithful and nuns wait a Pope Francis appearing at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, Sunday, March 23, 2025 (AP Photo/Riccardo De Luca)\n\nTwo life-threatening crises\n\nThe Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on February 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened.\n\nDoctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and soon thereafter, pneumonia in both lungs. Blood tests showed signs of anemia, low blood platelets and the onset of kidney failure, all of which later resolved after two blood transfusions.\n\nThe most serious setbacks began on February 28, when Francis experienced an acute coughing fit and inhaled vomit, requiring the use of a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask to help him breathe. He suffered two more respiratory crises a few days later, which required doctors to manually aspirate \"copious\" amounts of mucus from his lungs, at which point he began sleeping with the ventilation mask at night to help his lungs clear the accumulation of fluids.\n\nPope Francis waves as he appears at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, on Sunday, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nHe was never intubated and at no point lost consciousness. Doctors reported he always remained alert and cooperative, though they say he has probably lost a bit of weight given a natural loss of appetite.\n\n\"Unfortunately yes, there was a moment when many were saying that he might not make it. And it was painful for us,\" said Mario Balsamo, the owner of coffee shop in front of Gemelli.\n\n\"Instead, today with the discharge, we are very happy that he is well and we hope he will recover soon and will recover his strength.\"\n\nPope Francis leaves in a car the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, on Sunday, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Marco Ravagli)\n\n'I'm still alive!'\n\nDr Sergio Alfieri, the medical and surgical chief at Gemelli who coordinated Francis' medical team, stressed that not all patients who develop such a severe case of double pneumonia survive, much less are released from the hospital. He said Francis' life was at risk twice, during the two acute respiratory crises, and that the pope at the time understandably lost his typical good sense of humour.\n\n\"But one morning we went to listen to his lungs and we asked him how he was doing. When he replied, 'I'm still alive,' we knew he was OK and had gotten his good humor back,\" he said.\n\nAlfieri confirmed that Francis was still having trouble speaking due to the damage to his lungs and respiratory muscles. But he said such problems were normal, especially in older patients, and predicted his voice would eventually return to normal.\n\nPope Francis waves as he appears at a window of the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, on Sunday, March 23, 2025. (Francesco Sforza/Vatican press office via AP)\n\nNo confirmed appointments for now\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to confirm any upcoming events, including a scheduled audience on April 8 with King Charles III or Francis' participation in Easter services at the end of the month. But Carbone said he hoped Francis might be well enough to travel to Turkey at the end of May to participate in an important ecumenical anniversary.\n\nFrancis is also returning to the Vatican in the throes of a Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration scheduled to draw more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome this year. The pope has already missed several Jubilee audiences and will presumably miss several more, but Vatican officials say his absence hasn't significantly impacted the numbers of expected pilgrims arriving.\n\nOnly St John Paul II recorded a longer hospitalisation in 1981, when he spent 55 days at Gemelli for minor surgery and treatment of an infection.",

We know that as much as we work together and we have a good time and enjoy ourselves, we both know we want to try and beat each other and show who\u2019s best. And that\u2019s inevitable.\n\n\"So there\u2019s no point trying to hide away from that fact or make something of it. We\u2019re two competitors who both want to win.\"\n\nPiastri's victory in Shanghai was the third grand prix victory of his career, following triumphs in Hungary and Azerbaijan last season.\n\nThe Chinese GP win adds to victories in Hungary and Azerbaijan last year. (AP)\n\nBut the Australian has described Sunday's victory as \"the most satisfying\", because there was not any fault during the entire weekend from the Melbourne-born racer.\n\n\"The two wins I had previously were very different, and I think this one's been the most complete,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we started with a car that was quick, but pretty tricky at times, and I think we did a good job of trying to tackle that.\n\n\"And to come away with this result is a perfect end to the weekend.\"\n\nThe win has softened the heartache from round one in Australia when Piastri blew his chance at a podium, or even a race win, when he spun off track while running second.\n\nThe Australian was consistently quick that weekend as well, giving him belief more great results are on the horizon \u2014 starting with the Japanese Grand Prix in a fortnight.\n\n\"I think there's still going to be bumps along the road and things we can try and work on, but ultimately I think we're in a pretty happy place at the moment and, yeah, excited for the rest of the year,\" he said.\n\nRound three of the Formula 1 championship will be held in Suzuka at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday, April 6.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

    "text": "Lindsey Vonn's return to the podium \u2014 six years since stepping away from ski racing, 11 months since her partial knee replacement, and four months since announcing her return \u2014 hit her hard in the finish area.\n\nStruggling to catch her breath, but still managing the energy to raise her ski poles in celebration, the tears fell.\n\nThey were for joy and relief that she could even make it back to the World Cup circuit. They were for the satisfaction of proving all her doubters wrong.\n\nThey were, she explained, for showing \"this adventure that I set myself on is worth something\".\n\nVonn concluded her comeback season at age 40 with a second-place finish in a World Cup super-G race on Sunday at Sun Valley, Idaho, that was won by Swiss stand-out Lara Gut-Behrami.\n\nVonn became the oldest female Alpine ski racer to step on the podium of a World Cup race by six years.\n\n\"It was [expletive] hard,\" Vonn said.\n\n\"This is not easy what I'm doing. It just felt really good to say I did it. That I can still do it.\"\n\nVonn found her vintage form while flying down the twisting and steep Challenger course at the World Cup finals. The 82-time World Cup winner \u2014 along with three-time Olympic medallist \u2014 glanced at the scoreboard and soaked in the roar of the large crowd.\n\nLindsey Vonn will aim to compete at the 2026 Olympics. (Getty Images: Ezra Shaw)\n\nIt is a moment she will cherish.\n\n\"Age is just a number,\" Vonn said.\n\n\"If you feel good and you're mentally still driven and you work hard, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.\"\n\nShe was motivated by the doubters, too \u2014 those who criticised her for making a return.\n\n\"Sometimes the negative voices, they drive me more than the positive ones,\" Vonn said.\n\n\"I use all that as fuel. It propelled me through some tough times this year. I knew that I could do it.\n\n\"When I crossed the finish line, there's a lot of relief to be where I know I can be and to silence so many negative voices that have just been surrounding me, it feels like, all season. It was just a nice exclamation point to put on the season.\"\n\nThis was Vonn's first World Cup podium spot since March 15, 2018, when she finished third in a super-G in \u00c5re, Sweden. A year later in \u00c5re, she earned downhill bronze at the world championships before calling time on her career due to her knee.\n\nVonn received a titanium knee last April and was feeling so good that she announced in November her plans for a return.\n\n\"I just continue to prove that anything is possible,\" Vonn said. \"I've been knocked down so many times in my life personally, physically, mentally, beat down and I always pick myself back up. It's not always easy.\n\n\"It's actually really [expletive] hard work. But that's what it takes, putting one foot in front of the other and getting through the hard days. When you keep putting one foot in front of the other, it leads you to a place like today.\"\n\nBefore the race, her father Alan Kildow took her by the arm and just said: \"Fearless.\"\n\nLindsey Vonn has 138 career World Cup podiums. (Getty Images: Agence Zoom/Christophe Pallot)\n\nShe listened.\n\n\"Of all the races, of all the courses she's been on, this one really suits her,\" Kildow said of the redesigned Sun Valley course.\n\n\"A very clean, technically sound run could go a long run. She skied it like she had to.\"\n\nIt was Vonn's 138th career World Cup podium in her 408th World Cup start. She is within one of tying the most starts by a female Alpine racer, a mark held by Renate G\u00f6tschl of Austria.\n\nOne skier not surprised by Vonn's success is 34-year-old Italian racer Federica Brignone.\n\n\"She's Lindsey Vonn,\" said Brignone, who officially clinched the downhill discipline on Saturday after the race was cancelled, along with the overall crown.\n\n\"She's not somebody coming back from another injury. She has qualities and she's an amazing champion. Today, she put all the pieces [together] and did an amazing race.\"\n\nGut-Behrami finished in a time of 1 minute, 12.35 seconds \u2014 edging Vonn by 1.29 seconds \u2014 to earn the season-long super-G crystal globe by overtaking Brignone.\n\nGut-Behrami trailed by five points heading into Sunday's race. Gut-Behrami found plenty of speed and took some calculated risks to glide through the course. Brignone finished third, 1.33 seconds behind Gut-Behrami.\n\nThe final season-long super-G standings ended up Gut-Behrami, Brignone and Sofia Goggia of Italy.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"Two days ago, I finally found the happiness again on skis,\" Gut-Behrami explained.\n\n\"It's easier to ski fast when you're enjoying what you're doing. I've been looking for that the entire season.\"\n\nThe next race at the World Cup finals is on Tuesday with a women's giant slalom.\n\nFor Vonn, the season is over. Her plan is to rest a few weeks and then head to Europe for more testing of her ski equipment.\n\n\"I literally gave every single last ounce of energy that I had in the last race of the season,\" Vonn explained.\n\n\"I could barely breathe [at the finish], maybe because I was crying.\n\n\"It was a great race.\"\n\nAP",

    "text": "Having my son at age 36, I was made aware of the risks associated with my \"advanced maternal age\" pregnancy.\n\nI never heard about any specific benefits. The only thing I knew for sure was that it was the right time for me.\n\nBut there are several evidence-based advantages associated with late-age births \u2014 for both mum and bub. And given women are increasingly having babies when they are older, obstetrician Nisha Khot says we should be talking about them more.\n\n\"In the medical profession we are very good at talking about risks [but] often not equally good at talking about benefits,\" says Dr Khot, who is the vice president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG).\n\n\"It's not all doom and gloom.\"\n\nNoa Sterling, an obstetrician gynaecologist based in the US, has a passion for demystifying long-held myths about older mums, and uses her social platforms to break down the research.\n\nShe says her role is to \"turn down the dial\" of fear for people who are pregnant later in life.\n\n\"Advanced maternal age doesn't automatically mean high risk \u2026 that's one myth that I think is still enduring.\"\n\nOur experts Dr Nisha Khot, obstetrician and vice president of RANZCOG.\n\nDr Noa Sterling, US obstetrician gynaecologist and content creator\n\nDr Chantel Thornton, specialist breast cancer surgeon at Epworth HealthCare\n\nDr Rui Wang, reproductive epidemiologist at the University of Sydney\n\nRisks associated with advanced maternal age\n\nAustralian women are increasingly having children later in life.\n\nBefore 1991, only 5 per cent of first-time mothers were over the age of 35. By 2020, that figure increased to 17 per cent.\n\nWomen on motherhood after 40 Photo shows Gayle Dickerson takes a selfie with her son at a cafe table We hear from four mothers about the highs of lows of parenting after 40.\n\nBefore we get to the positives these mothers and their children may experience, it's important to acknowledge there are associated risks.\n\nAs we get older, Dr Sterling says we are more likely to have chronic medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disorders.\n\n\"Some of the risks are because people who are 35 [and older] are more likely to have other medical problems going on.\"\n\nBut even for healthy people, there are still some increased risks.\n\n\"That is mainly because there's an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, because as we age, our eggs \u2014 the DNA in our eggs \u2014 gets damaged,\" Dr Sterling says, adding that an embryo with a chromosomal abnormality is more likely to result in pregnancy loss.\n\nDr Noa Sterling uses her social platforms to educate followers on advanced maternal age. (Supplied)\n\nPre-term birth, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes are other examples of health risks associated with later age pregnancy.\n\nDr Khot says the likelihood of a caesarean-section is greater.\n\n\"[That] may relate to pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes or pregnancy complications, or it may sometimes be maternal choice.\n\n\"Doctors would intervene if there was a medical or pregnancy complication and may, in some cases, recommend caesarean section as a safer birth option.\"\n\nAustralian research from 2017 found advanced maternal age was associated with a two-fold increased likelihood of birth by caesarean section in both nulliparous (not having given birth previously) and multiparous (having given birth previously) women.\n\nHowever, the majority of these women birthed vaginally.\n\nABC Lifestyle Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nWomen of advanced maternal age are at increased risk of stillbirth, but only if it's their first baby, explains Dr Sterling.\n\n\"If you are advanced maternal age, but it's not your first baby, you are actually at a lower risk of stillbirth than a younger person who's having their first baby.\n\n\"For whatever reason, stillbirth is much more common with first pregnancies than it is with subsequent [ones].\"\n\nAnd there is evidence that being older at the birth of a woman's first child is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\nChantel Thornton, a specialist breast cancer surgeon at Epworth HealthCare in Melbourne, says in the immediate period after giving birth, there is a higher index of breast cancer in all women.\n\n\"That risk is higher in women of mature age,\" she says, because \"when you are older, you are already at increased risk of breast cancer merely by age alone, and therefore if you add the hormonal surge of pregnancy, your risk of breast cancer will be slightly elevated compared to women who have never had children.\"\n\nHowever in advanced years, \"when it is more common to get breast cancer in the 60s and 70s\", Dr Thornton says the breast cancer risk is actually lower than for women who have never had children, indicating a protective factor later in life.\n\nMaternal longevity and improved cognition\n\nAdvanced maternal age doesn't automatically mean high risk, says Dr Sterling. (Pexels)\n\nSeveral studies, including 2016 research involving more than 20,000 women, have found a link between late-age births and maternal longevity, but note a direct casual relationship cannot be established.\n\n\"[Research shows] later age at last birth, or giving birth at a later age, is associated with increased longevity, meaning you're more likely to have a longer life,\" Dr Sterling says.\n\n\"We see that people who give birth later on in life have longer telomeres, which are the non-coding end of chromosomes that help protect our chromosomes from degradation.\"\n\nBasically, longer telomeres mean cells can divide more often before deteriorating or dying.\n\nResearchers aren't sure if people who are able to have children later in life were always going to have longer telomeres, or if pregnancy later in life makes it that way, explains Dr Sterling.\n\n\"I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss [the latter] because we know that the DNA from our children stays with us always, and we know that it can actually help our body repair itself.\"\n\nOn DNA, Dr Sterling says there is research showing women who have more male DNA from being pregnant with a boy may have lower rates of dementia.\n\nAnd she says more generally, there is some evidence women who have been pregnant later in life may have better cognitive function.\n\n\"That may be because in pregnancy, your progesterone [and] your estrogen get like 20 to 40 times higher than it is pre-pregnancy,\" Dr Sterling says.\n\n\" That big hormone load may actually be protective for cognitive function. \"\n\nIt all sounds positive, but Dr Khot says we should consider \"we don't [always] know the extent to which other underlying factors contribute to these beneficial effects rather than pregnancy alone.\"\n\nThose underlying factors may include needing to staying active and engaged for longer \u2014 just to name two possibilities.\n\n\"You could imagine if you are having a baby when you are older, a toddler is going to be active, so you will have to be active [for longer],\" Dr Khot says.\n\n\"Once your child goes to school you will be helping them, using brain cells for longer.\"\n\nDr Nisha Knot is the vice-president at RANZCOG. (Supplied)\n\nShe adds health benefits may also come down to women having babies later in life being more financially stable than younger mums, and therefore more able to invest in healthcare.\n\nReproductive epidemiologist Rui Wang from the University of Sydney says while promising, the above research should be interpreted with caution.\n\nHe says there are a lot of factors after birth that can impact longevity and cognition, for example, but are not addressed in the above studies.\n\nSome of the cohorts used, for example from the 1990s, may also not be applicable to the current population, Dr Wang says.\n\nMuch of the research also looks at age at the birth of someone's last child, as opposed to their age when having their first.\n\n\"All this kind of evidence, it's very promising,\" Dr Rui says, but adds further research needs to be done to paint a clearer picture.\n\nAcademic and health benefits for kids\n\nChildren born to older parents may do better in school, be healthier, and have fewer social, emotional and behavioural issues, says Dr Sterling.\n\n\"And we see this still when we control for socio-economic factors,\" Dr Sterling says of research in this area.\n\nResearchers can control for socio-economic factors by collecting data on relevant aspects like income, education level, and occupation, and then statistically adjusting the analysis to account for potential influences of these factors on the study outcome.\n\nDr Sterling says that could indicate we get \"better at parenting as we get older\", regardless of what money or education we have access to, for example.\n\n\" It's too bad that our peak fertility is really 18 to 31. \"\n\nFor example, a 2012 study published in the British Medical Journal found language development in children was associated with improvements with increasing maternal age.\n\nThe same study also found children of older parents were also less likely to present to the emergency room with unintentional injuries.\n\nA 2016 study published in the European Journal of Developmental Psychology found older maternal age was associated with fewer behavioural, social and emotional difficulties in children at age seven and at age 11 (but not at age 15).\n\nWhat are some of the positives you've experienced having children later in life? Share with us via lifestyle@abc.net.au\n\nFertility and pregnancy risks separate issues\n\nDr Sterling says the information she shares isn't about encouraging women to wait longer to have babies. But to support those who, for whatever reason, have become pregnant later in life.\n\n\"It's really important for us to continue to raise awareness and to talk about the fact that fertility declines as we age; we see quite a significant drop-off in fertility in the late 30s and certainly 40 plus.\n\n\"But once that individual is pregnant, rather than just fearmonger and scare them about all of the things that they're increased risk for, talk to them [and say] there's benefits to this pregnancy for you and for this baby.\"\n\nDr Khot says it is useful to focus less on age, and more on the individual.\n\n\"There are risks that go with a teen being pregnant, and [risks with] being 48 and pregnant, and benefit in both.\"",

    "text": "Queensland will join other states and territories in a deal to make up the \"funding shortfall\" for public education, with an extra $2.8 billion from the Commonwealth over the next decade.\n\nSpeaking with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Canberra on Monday, Premier David Crisafulli said the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement is the \"biggest investment in schools in our nation's history\".\n\nQueensland is the last to sign up to the deal, under which the Commonwealth has agreed to lift its share of public school funding from 20 to 25 per cent.\n\nStates would also be required to increase funding of public schools to 75 per cent of the minimum amount recommended by the 2012 Gonski Review, meaning the schools would become \"fully funded\".\n\nNew South Wales was the second last to join, when it signed on earlier this month.\n\nSpeaking with Anthony Albanese in Canberra on Monday, David Crisafulli says the deal is the \"biggest investment in schools in our nation's history\". (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nMr Crisafulli said Queensland's state schools had challenges other states and territories didn't.\n\n\"We are the most decentralised state. We've got a large portion of rural and regional and Indigenous schools,\" he said.\n\n\"We have challenges because of that, not just geographically, but challenges that have historically been baked in as a result, our NAPLAN results aren't what we have wanted to see in recent years.\n\n\" What this does is give us a decade-long commitment to be able to turn the funding shortfall around, and with that will come the ability to turn those results around. \"\n\nMr Albanese said it was an \"historic day\".\n\nHe said the agreement would fully fund every public school student in Australia.\n\nFull funding is the amount set out by the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) \u2014 an estimate of how much funding a school needs to meet students' needs recommended by the Gonski review.\n\n\"Today, we reach the point for the first time in Australian history where every student, public and private, will be delivered the school funding that they deserve, the school resourcing standard that was identified by David Gonski more than a decade ago,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\nThe Coalition's Gonski 2.0 reforms required states to fund public schools at 75 per cent of the SRS on top of the feds' 20 per cent, leaving a 5 per cent gap.\n\nCurrently, public schools in all states and territories, except the ACT, are billions of dollars short of the funding needed to meet minimum standards.\n\n'Not a blank cheque'\n\nMr Albanese said the deal was the \"biggest-ever investment\" in Queensland public schools by the Commonwealth.\n\nIt is expected to support 560,000 public school students in the state.\n\nPublic school funding, explained Photo shows A graphic showing a group of school children and federal education minister Jason Clare There was a major development around funding for public schools this week. Let us break it down for you.\n\n\"It isn't a blank cheque, this money is tied to real reforms like evidence-based teaching practices, phonics and numeracy checks, catch-up tutoring and more mental health support.\"\n\nOverall, the agreement will bring about an extra $16.5 billion in federal funding to the country's public schools from 2025.\n\nThe parties will now sign the Queensland Bilateral Agreement to tie funding to reforms to \"help students catch up, keep up and finish school\".\n\nThey include year 1 phonics and numeracy checks to identify students who need extra help, targeted catch-up support, wellbeing initiatives and schemes to improve teacher retention and reduce teachers' workloads.\n\nThere will also be targets to achieve, including that by 2030 the proportion of students finishing high school will be the highest it has ever been.\n\nOther targets include lowering the number of students in the NAPLAN needing \"additional support\" by 10 per cent, increasing the number of students at the \"strong\" and \"exceeding\" proficiency reading and numeracy levels by 10 per cent by 2030, and increasing student attendance rate nationally to the 2019 level of 91.4 per cent.\n\nWill Dutton support the boost?\n\nAustralian Education Union federal president Correna Haythorpe said Monday's announcement was \"the final agreement we've been waiting for\".\n\nShe called on opposition leader Peter Dutton to match the federal government's funding.\n\n\"Are you going to back in-full funding, and will you commit to the full 25 per cent Commonwealth share that we know is needed for public schools across the nation?\"\n\nQueensland Teachers' Union president Cresta Richardson says the funding would help manage the challenges teachers face, like workload. (ABC News)\n\nThe Coalition has previously pledged to do so. But earlier this month, Shadow Education Minister Sarah Henderson said the government was yet to \"come clean\" on the details of its agreements with states and territories.\n\nQueensland Teachers' Union president Cresta Richardson said it was a day she didn't think \"would ever come\".\n\n\"In Queensland, we have some issues with workload, it's crippling. Teacher shortages as well as occupational violence, but this money will go some way to support resourcing to manage some of these issues,\" she said.\n\nWhere's the money coming from?\n\nAsked whether the $2.8b for Queensland will be in the upcoming budget, Mr Albanese said \"most\" of the spending was in the mid-year budget update delivered in December.\n\nBut he said there would be some \"additional investment given to Queensland that will be accounted for in the pre-election fiscal outlook\".\n\nMr Crisafulli said he had brought forward some state funding to \"secure the deal\".\n\n\"We've under-invested in public education as a state for too long, and this was an opportunity too good to miss,\" he said.",

(Supplied: Sarah Tedder)\n\nIt turned out bicycles just weren't a thing on TI.\n\nThere was no bike shop on the island and shipping them from Cairns, the nearest mainland city more than 1,000 kilometres away, was expensive.\n\nAfter surveying community members nearly a year ago, Ms Tedder found while some kids had a bike, it was a different story for adults, with many relying on taxis to get their children to school or run errands.\n\n\"People were telling me they were spending $100 a week on taxis,\" Ms Tedder said.\n\nAlong with a group of locals and the mayor, she has since led a bicycle revolution \u2014 Mobilise TI \u2014 to improve access to bikes for the island's nearly 3,000 residents.\n\nMobilise TI runs a monthly bike hospital and bike exchange. (Supplied: Sarah Tedder)\n\nSince July 2024 the group has repaired and rehomed dozens of unused bikes, run a weekly bike-to-school \"bus\" and a monthly \"bike hospital\" teaching locals how to repair and maintain their two-wheelers.\n\nMobilise TI has also crowdfunded $20,000 to ship 100 bikes to the island in the coming months.\n\n\"We're really focused on a cultural shift making bike riding more socially acceptable and culturally acceptable because it is quite novel still to see adults riding,\" Ms Tedder said.\n\n\"We figured if an adult has access to a bicycle then that might actually mean a whole family can get around more affordably and more sustainably.\"\n\nThe bike-to-school bus runs every Friday morning. (Supplied: Sarah Tedder)\n\nProject targets local mums\n\nThose who can't easily access a car have been the focus of the program.\n\nJoy Robin sought help from the bike hospital last year to fix her daughter's bike and ended up receiving a second-hand bicycle of her own.\n\n\"[Before that] we were either walking or catching taxis or getting a lift from family members,\" Ms Robin said.\n\n\" It's so good being on the bike. It's reliable, it's there just ready for us to go, you've always got a breeze, keeps us healthy too. \"\n\nThursday Island mum Joy Robin and daughter Linze with their bikes.

In the seaside town of Penguin, it's something of a north star.\n\nWith the Big Penguin, and penguin-themed bins and bollards, the small but thriving Tasmanian town stands behind its name.\n\nThis year, the community of about 3,500 is celebrating 150 years, in signature Penguin style.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of locals kicked off the sesquicentenary by dressing in black and white, donning a penguin mask, and joining in the Great Penguin Waddle \u2014 flapping, hopping, and dancing along the foreshore.\n\nHundreds of people took part in The Great Penguin Waddle on Sunday.

(ABC News: Georgia Hogge)\n\nOver time, while Burnie became an industrial hub, with the establishment of the pulp mill and titanium dioxide plant, Mr Dunham said Penguin served as the \"dormitory neighbouring town\" where workers returned home to.\n\n\"Penguin subsequently grew through that,\" he said.\n\n\"We've always been the small, little cousin type thing.\n\n\"I must say, it's been more of an evolution than a revolution.\n\n\" That's probably one of Penguin's greatest assets, that we haven't grown too quickly. \"\n\nPenguin's main street in 1922.

He described the town as \"a lovely little place\".\n\nLiving a stone's throw away from the cemetery, which sits atop a hill and looks out to an expanse of sea, he became transfixed with a grave marked \"John Doe\" \u2014 a name used for unknown men.\n\nHe looked into it, only to find seven unmarked plots belonging to \"paupers\".\n\nCraig Dunham says Penguin is Burnie's \"little cousin\". (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nWanting to honour them with headstones, Mr Hartley turned to a less conventional fundraising approach \u2014 stripping.\n\nFortunate enough to know a theatre costume designer, he donned a custom-made kit of black pants \"all velcro and zips\", a little sleeveless vest, bow tie, striped socks and a hat.\n\n\"I'm not a dancer, I'm not a stripper, but I did my best,\" he said.\n\n\"It was just a fun time, I could never do it now, I look back and think, 'Ross, you did that'.\"\n\nRoss Hartley says Penguin is \"a lovely little place\". (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nThe plots were marked and the cemetery was heritage listed in 2007.\n\nIt motivated Mr Hartley to do more at the site. Since then, the graveyard has hosted dinners, and music amongst the gravestones.\n\n\"What we've tried to do, and have achieved to a large extent, is making it a place for the living as much as for the dead,\" Mr Hartley said.\n\nPenguin bins here to stay as replacement plan trashed Photo shows A rubbish bin on a pathway with artwork of painted penguins In the town of Penguin, they love their bird-shaped bins so much a council plan to replace them was never going to fly.\n\nMore recently, the beloved penguin-themed bins were set to be trashed, to make way for new bins that weren't in keeping with the bird theme.\n\nIt prompted outrage from locals, who rallied against the council, submitting a petition to save them.\n\nMr Hartley went so far as submitting a heritage application, which was knocked back because they were not the original design.\n\nBut, ultimately, hearing the community's cries, the council decided not just to keep the bins, but to bring in more.\n\nThe Central Coast Council backtracked on a plan to remove the penguin-themed bins in Penguin. (ABC Northern Tasmania: Monte Bovill)\n\nCentral Coast Mayor Cheryl Fuller said while the town was small, it was memorable.\n\n\"If only the people that named the town of Penguin understood that in the future, and in 150 years' time, the people of this town and the people that live in the surrounding areas would come to actually represent the penguin,\" she said.\n\n\"It's small, it's iconic, it's cute, it's resilient, it's adaptable, and they take care of themselves in a colony of penguins, and that's exactly what the people of Penguin do.\"\n\nPenguin residents are proud of their town. (ABC News: Morgan Timms)\n\nAs for Penguin's future, Mr Dunham is optimistic.\n\n\"We'll always be relatively small and keep that civic pride and sense of community,\" he said.",

    "text": "Travis Head has helped condemn Ashes rival Jofra Archer to a record-breaking day of bowling misery as he kicked off his IPL season with a dazzling half-century for Pat Cummins's Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nThe Australian left-hander carried on where he left off in Hyderabad's terrific 2024 campaign as his blistering 67 off 31 balls launched the home team to the second-highest total in IPL history, a massive 6-286, on their way to a 44-run opening victory against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.\n\nThe chief victim of Head's familiar brand of mayhem, as he raced to 50 off 21 balls, was England quick Archer, who was smashed by his Aussie rival for 23 off his first over, including a humungous six measuring 105 metres that soared into the crowd beyond deepest midwicket.\n\nThat was just the start of Archer's ordeal.\n\nEven after Head departed, Ishan Kishan continued the rampage, scoring a century off just 45 balls with Archer on his menu too, as the Indian international hammered him for three sixes in an over.\n\nBy the end of his four overs, during which he had got so frazzled he even got warned for delivering a head-high beamer, Archer could only gaze forlornly on figures of 4-0-76-0 \u2014 the single worst analysis in the history of the league.\n\nJofra Archer was humbled in his four overs, conceding 76 runs for no wickets. (Getty Images: Pankaj Nangia)\n\nOne of the game's most feared pacemen had gone for four sixes and 10 fours, as Hyderabad went on to just miss out on eclipsing their IPL record 3-287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last year, with Kishan finishing 106 not out off 47.\n\nThere was surely no way the visitors could get near that total, but nothing is certain any more amid the IPL run-fests and Rajasthan gave it such a good go as they amassed 6-242 that Hyderabad captain Cummins had to admit: \"It's scary\u2026\"\n\nAustralia's skipper himself found his bowling getting the treatment, as he recorded wretched figures of 0-60 off his four overs, having been hit for five sixes and four fours off his allocation.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAnd his fellow Aussie Adam Zampa, used as an impact sub to replace Head, also got shoved around, going for 48 runs off his four, but at least he responded with the key scalp of Dhruv Jurel, bowling the top-scoring wicketkeeper who'd threatened with six sixes in his 35-ball 70.\n\nIt was the perfect start for Cummins, who'd led Sunrisers to the final last year and, now strengthened by new signing Kishan, has realistic hopes of going one better in 2025.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"We get 280-odd, and it's scary, you still know you're going to go for runs and it's going to be tough. When you have such a big score, one over can win it for your side. Ishan today was incredible for us.\"\n\nIn the evening match, Australian bowler Nathan Ellis had a winning debut for Chennai Super Kings, as the home side beat Mumbai Indians by four wickets with five balls remaining.\n\nEllis took 1-38 in his four overs, helping to keep Mumbai down to a sub-par 9-155 before New Zealander Rachin Ravindra guided Chennai home in an awkward chase with an unbeaten 65 off 45 balls.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

But at some stage, those hard decisions about where we're going to make changes have to be considered. \"The NDIS, for instance, is one of those areas in the budget that has run out of control. It was growing at 14 per cent per annum. \"Now, when we went into opposition, the Coalition said to the government that we would work with them to rein in that spending and get it under control. It's been brought back to around 8 per cent. It actually looks like it's going to be much higher than that this year, but it's been brought under control somewhat. We think that there's more that can be done. We would hope that when Labor goes into opposition, that they would work with us to try and rein in that.\"\n\nThe Coalition argues her comment about \"more that can be done\" was because the scheme's growth was yet to reach the government's target of eight per cent. (The government says it'll get there by mid next year.)\n\nBut NDIS Minister Amanda Rishworth says Senator Hume's remarks raise big questions.\n\n\"The comments by Jane Hume suggests that there are cuts going to come, so she's got to explain what supports are going to be cut for people with disabilities. Who's going to be kicked off the NDIS?\" she told ABC News. \"They are the questions \u2014 they now need to be upfront and tell people before an election.\"\n\nA spokesperson for NDIS Shadow Minister Michael Sukkar said the Coalition is \"focused on ensuring the NDIS remains fit for purpose and sustainable for future generations to come.\"",

    "text": "A political battleground over the issue of working from home has emerged ahead of the May federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debate kicked off earlier this month when Opposition finance spokesperson Jane Hume said a Coalition government would force all Commonwealth public servants to return to the office five days per week .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Work from home arrangements for public servants should only be in place when the arrangements work for the employee's department, their team, and the individual,\" Hume said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition later watered the proposal down to \"pre-COVID levels\" \u2014 but not after Labor jumped on the comments, arguing paring back work from home would disadvantage working women.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday this type of flexibility had allowed Australians to overcome \"the tyranny of distance\", adding that it was a cost of living issue and could also increase traffic and congestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've met people who have moved into regional Australia and are working in our capital cities, they're working effectively because they can work online,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling shows the Coalition's proposal hasn't been met well by voters and has cost it support in crucial mortgage-belt seats, according to a YouGov poll provided to AAP.\n\n\n\n\"Policies such as getting rid of work-from-home and opposing right to disconnect laws impact working families, and they have noticed this, and they don't like these policies,\" YouGov's director of public data Paul Smith said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA senior Labor Party source has told SBS News the party was confident the Coalition's policy was unpopular with voters, and it is an issue the government will campaign on during the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor is confident the issue has alienated some working women and is seen as failing to understand the modern workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent days, there's been data released separately by Labor and the unions to hammer home their point.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How to make work more flexible in 2025\n\nLabor estimates transport and parking would cost workers about $5,000 a year if they had to return to the office five days a week, up from three.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost is based on estimates people would spend an extra two hours a week in the car, or just under 100 extra hours a year, with commuters driving an average of just over an hour in the car to get to and from work.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) issued a statement on Monday estimating any federal paring back of work from home arrangements would impact one in three workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peak union body said its analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data found more than 600,000 workers nationally currently work from home and a further 320,000 employees do so due to childcare or other caring responsibilities.\n\n\n\nThe Coalition though says it is not proposing a blanket ban on working from home, insisting the focus was only on public servants and their productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No one is banning work-from-home arrangements, that is a Labor lie,\" Hume said on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's shameful the way the Labor Party has tried to twist this policy into something it isn't.\"\n\n\n\nBut the ACTU isn't giving up the fight, saying any clampdown would have a \"flow-on effect\" from public to private sector workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(Opposition leader Peter) Dutton would have to tear up the right to flexible work in the Fair Work Act to get the Australian Public Service back to the office,\" ACTU president Michele O'Neil told SBS News in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That would ruin it for everyone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 36 per cent of employed people worked from home regularly in August 2024, according to the ABS, down from a peak of 40 per cent in August 2021.\n\n\n\n",

How did you arrive at that number? And according to people who've already been speaking on the streets of Australia this morning, they've found it fairly underwhelming in terms of how much it costs to do their grocery shop every week. Why $150?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: This is a bit more hip pocket help for households. It recognizes that even with all of the progress we've made together as Australians on inflation, that people are still under pressure. And so it's providing more help with electricity bills for another six months, taking $150 off those electricity bills, recognizing the pressure that people are talking about in communities around Australia and feeling in communities right around Australia. My message for them would be that it's not the only thing we're doing to help with the cost of living. We've got the tax cuts rolling out, we've got cheaper medicines, we're cutting student debt, we're strengthening Medicare, because more bulk milling means less pressure on families. It's one of a number of ways that we're easing the cost of living because we know that that's still a big pressure on household budgets.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: You haven't met that $275 cut to energy bill promise. So what do you say to voters that are now increasingly distrustful about election promises?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, we cut electricity bills by $300 last year compared to what they would have otherwise been. The official inflation numbers show that electricity bills came off by 25% last year, and that's mostly, but not entirely, because of our efforts to help people with the cost of living by providing these energy bill rebates. So we're providing this help, this hip pocket help for households in the form of energy bill rebates at the same time as we add more cleaner and cheaper, more reliable energy to the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: One of the other big pressures on families is childcare. You have made changes, but will Australians see universal free childcare in a second Labor term of government?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, this budget will budget for two very big and very substantial steps towards universality when it comes to early childhood education, building more early childhood education centres, particularly in areas where there is a shortage, and particularly for nonprofit providers, as well as our three day guarantee, which is all about getting the system closer to universality. The Prime Minister, the ministers, myself, the whole government, big enthusiasts for early childhood education. It's a game changer for families and for children and for the national economy, because it makes it easier for people to work more and earn more if they want to, and it gives our kids the best start in life. That's why we're investing billions of dollars in the three day guarantee in new childcare centres as well. Getting closer and closer to universality\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Is the second term universal childcare plan a possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, I'm focused on the government's fourth budget, not a fifth budget, if we get the opportunity to deliver one. We've said that universality is our objective. That's our aspiration, and in a number of budgets. Now, really most of our budgets, we've taken very big steps towards making early childhood education cheaper. Now, building more centres, the three day guarantee. All of these things are the necessary prerequisites for universality, and that's why we're investing in them in the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Can I ask you about tariffs? Could the iron or trade with China end up being under threat here? We know the US has spoken to previous Australian governments about this issue. How realistic Do you think that is as a potential problem? Is it forecast for in the budget?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, it remains to be seen whether the Americans go down that path. Obviously, we'll get more clarity in the coming days and weeks about new policies coming from the newish administration in the United States. More broadly, the uncertainty in the global economy and these escalating trade tensions are casting a dark shadow over the global economy and over our budget. One of the reasons why our budget, which is primarily about the cost of living, is also about investing in building our future and making our economy more resilient is because we are in a new world of uncertainty and unpredictability, and that's just one example.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: When it comes to the potential hole left by the US potentially pulling out of foreign aid in the Pacific. Is this budget going to put money in at least as a contingency to fill that breach?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, we're already investing in our region, and in my portfolio, for example, we've done a lot of work when it comes to Pacific banking, recognizing the economic challenges and also the security challenge challenges in our amongst our nearest neighbours, and so we've been engaging with enthusiasm in a considered and a methodical way. People shouldn't expect a big increase in the aid budget on Tuesday night, but they can expect us to continue to engage in the Pacific and beyond in the service of our national and economic interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: What about the fraying of social cohesion in our own country? How will this budget address that? What extra funding will you put in place?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, we made it clear over the course of recent months and over the past year or so that we're making more investments in combating a division in our society, making our society more cohesive at a really challenging time. We shouldn't pretend that there aren't opportunities for people who want to divide our community. And so we've announced already a number of important investments in keeping people safe and trying to keep our community as united as we can be, people will see that in the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Got a few questions here from our readers that I wanted to put to you. Firstly, in relation to carers, a question came through asking, Why have carers been let down time and time again as their financial security is eroded. What do you say to that?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, first of all, I think from memory, whether it was the last budget or the budget before we took some steps when it comes to carers, and I understand carers being as important as they are in our communities and in our country, that we should always be looking to do the best we can buy them. I'd also say that so much of what, of our cost of living agenda, has been informed by and guided by people who need us the most. You know, whether it's the changes to payments, whether it's the rent assistance, whether it's the getting wages moving again, whether it's the cheaper medicines, is a big part of the story for carers, I know whether it's strengthening Medicare. All of these things together are about recognizing that people are under pressure, including carers, and doing what we responsibly can to help.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: What's in this budget for pensioners?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, a lot of the cost of living help is motivated by the pressure that pensioners are under. If you think about that, the obviously, the indexation is automatic. But in addition to that, so much of our health agenda is driven by getting out of pocket health costs down. I spend a lot of time with the pensioners, particularly the age pensioners in my local community, and I know that out of pocket health costs are a huge part of the pressure that they're under. And so strengthening Medicare, the way that we froze the PBS at $7.70 in addition to what else we're doing in the PBS system, all of that is about recognizing that pressure and doing something about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: The coalition has this morning, foreshadowed significantly shrinking the money being spent on the NDIS. Do you need to match that?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: No, and that was a new half announcement made by the coalition today, and what we know is that they make these announcements on the run, and then they typically don't come clean on what that means for Australians with a disability. We've got investment in the NDIS to a more sustainable level. It was up near 14% growth now about 8% they're now talking about something between two and 3% they need to come clean to Australians with a disability about what that means for the services that they need and deserve, and more broadly, while they're at it, this week is the perfect opportunity for them to come clean on the $600 billion in cuts that they will need to find to fund their nuclear reactors, what that means For Medicare and pensions and payments and the NDIS and veterans, they have left it far too long to come clean on that.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: It's widely accepted that the interest rate increases hurt the poorest, hardest and first. Why didn't your government do more with the levers at your disposal to help them?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: I don't think any objective observer of this government could conclude anything other than we have in each of our four budgets now provided as much responsible cost of living relief as we can. We permanently increase working age payments, including jobseeker we've strengthened Medicare. We've made early education cheaper. We've provided two rounds of rent assistance. We've got wages moving again, starting with the minimum wage and industries dominated by women. These are all the tax cuts. We rewrote the tax cuts so that 3 million Australians on low and middle incomes didn't miss out. So this has been our motivation to help people who need help. We know that cost of living pressures are front of mind for people, and that's why cost of living is front and centre in this budget like it was in the first three.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Economist Chris Richardson says much of our spending is stupid. Much of our taxing is terrible. Ken Henry, who's also been active in this space in his discussions, has also talked about acts of wilful bastardry around the way wealth inequality exists in our country. What do you look back on this term and your time as treasurer and wish you could have done more to address those big issues?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, first of all, I mean, I respect those guys that they're not always right, but I always listen to them respectfully. Chris Richardson is more or less a permanent critic of governments. His job is to get his name in the paper. My job is to make it all add up when it comes to the comments that Ken Henry has made. I worked closely with Ken, I think the world of Ken Henry and the challenge that he is describing is really the challenge I was responding to when we took that big political risk to rewrite the tax cuts so that young people got a tax cut. It's the motivation behind what we're doing in student debt, what we're doing in housing, what we're doing in fee free TAFE. All of these things are about recognizing that the pressures in our economy and in our society do fall disproportionately. That's why there's been a focus on the most vulnerable. That's why there's been a focus on young people in particular, and so I will stack up my record on helping young people with the tax cuts and housing and education and all of these ways against our predecessors, because this is a government that cares about young people. We care deeply about the intergenerational disadvantage in our country. And as treasurer, I've made it a priority as treasurer in a second term.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: If that does happen, will those big questions around the structural nature of our tax system have to be addressed?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, we're not proposing new changes to the tax system beyond what we've already announced when it comes to raising additional revenue. We've got the PRRT changes through. We still want to get the superannuation changes through we've made changes in multinational tax with reforming income taxes. So in terms of revenue raises, we're not taking to the election a new raft of that. There'll be some additional measures in the budget around compliance and the like, as you would expect, the issue that Ken is identifying when it comes to the generational disadvantage, and particularly as it relates to young people, we have got a very substantial agenda there, and I've run through it, taken the opportunity to run through it today, but the tax cuts, the student debt relief, the issues in housing and education, all of these things are motivated by the challenge that Ken rightly identifies.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Finally, Treasurer, when we see the budget on Tuesday, will we see a net overseas migration number which suggests Labor is the party of a big Australia?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: You'll see the net overseas migration forecasts will be updated. We got a number for net overseas migration, I think, last week, or certainly in the last couple of weeks, and it showed that we were 10,000 lower than what we had anticipated. We're managing net overseas migration down in a responsible and a considered and a methodical way. There are always swings and roundabouts in the forecast. It's not just about how many people are arriving, but also how many people are leaving Australia, departing Australia. And so there'll be some some modest changes to the net overseas migration forecast. You'll see them on Tuesday,\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: And any changes to visa costs, we know in the past, we've seen visas be a kind of easy area for treasurers to reap in some more revenue. Is that coming this time around?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Well, what we've tried to do is we've tried to make sure that the cost of visas reflect our efforts to try and get through the backlog. I think you and I have spoken about this on a number of occasions. One of the big challenges that we had in the budget and in the public service was we had this huge backlog. And so from time to time, we've changed visa charges to help fund the efforts that we've made there to get the backlog down. Not prepared to foreshadow or flag any more steps in that direction, but what we've shown is a willingness to manage the visa system in a responsible way to try and get the backlog down to more manageable levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nANNA: Well we thank you very much for your time, speak to you on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHALMERS: Thanks very much, Anna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The federal Opposition has clarified it has no policy to cut spending on the National Disability Insurance Scheme after Treasurer Jim Chalmers urged the coalition to \"come clean\" on its plans for the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Opposition finance spokesperson Jane Hume said spending on the scheme had \"run out of control\" and suggested the party could look to tighten its growth if it won government.\n\n\n\n\"The NDIS, for instance, is one of those areas in the budget that has run out of control; it was growing at 14 per cent per annum,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's been brought back to around eight per cent \u2026 but it's been brought under control somewhat. We think that there's more that can be done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if the Coalition had a target in mind for NDIS growth levels, she said: \"The most important thing \u2026 is in the long term that all government spending doesn't grow faster than the economy itself.\"\n\n\n\nOpposition finance spokesperson Jane Hume said on Sunday spending on the NDIS had \"run out of control\". Source: AAP / aap The nation's economy is forecast to grow by 2-3 per cent each year over the next four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, a report from the NDIA \u2014 the body that administers the NDIS \u2014 found the scheme was on track to meet the target of eight per cent spending growth in the four years to 2028, set by former NDIS minister Bill Shorten.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with SBS News ahead of the federal budget on Tuesday , Chalmers said Labor would not match any proposed cuts.\n\n\n\nHe said the Opposition should clarify its plans for the NDIS and how it would affect Australians with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They make these announcements on the run, and then they typically don't come clean on what that means for Australians with a disability,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They need to come clean to Australians with a disability about what that means for the services that they need and deserve.\"\n\n\n\nLater on Sunday, a spokesperson for Hume said she was speaking about government spending as a whole, not the NDIS specifically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The opposition does not have a policy to reduce NDIS spending in line with economic growth, and is not advocating cutting NDIS spending to 2 to 3 per cent,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to SBS News.\n\n\n\nLabor says $5000 cost to return to office\n\nThe Coalition has also attacked public servants for working from home too much, saying they would force workers back to the office.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor estimates transport and parking would cost workers about $5000 a year if they had to return to the office five days a week, up from three.\n\n\n\nThe cost is based on estimates people would spend an extra two hours a week in the car, or just under 100 extra hours a year, with commuters driving an average of just over an hour in the car to get to and from work.\n\n\n\nNew era of 'global economic uncertainty'\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, the treasurer also discussed new international challenges to Australia's economy, and said Australians shouldn't expect a \"big increase\" in foreign aid .\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers said Australia would be getting more clarity about trade policies from its major trading partner the United States, as 25 per cent tariffs on Australian aluminium and steel are set to take force on 2 April , and said the world had entered a new era of uncertainty.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the potential for US President Donald Trump to zero in on Australia's highly lucrative iron ore exports to China Chalmers said: \"it remains to be seen whether the Americans go down that path\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe played down the likelihood of Australia filling the huge gap in global aid made by Donald Trump's decision to slash US aid programs.\n\n\n\nCost of living relief to help vulnerable\n\nChalmers said support for young people and others struggling with cost-of-living relief would be prioritised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that cost of living pressures are front of mind for people, and that's why cost of living is front and centre in this budget,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the budget would recognise \"the pressures in our economy and in our society do fall disproportionately.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Are international students to blame for the housing crisis?\n\n\"That's why there's been a focus on the most vulnerable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government announced on Sunday every household would receive $150 rebates on their electricity bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalition will support the new rebate but pledged to bring down power prices without government subsidies, with the election to be fought largely on cost of living pressures.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "International students have faced blame from both sides of politics for ostensibly contributing to rising housing costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in May 2024 that increased numbers of foreign students \"puts pressure on prices and rents\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same month, Victorian Liberal Senator Jane Hume told Sky News that they put \"exceptional pressure\" on housing markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a new study has found they are \"not the culprits of the rental crisis in Australia\" and its authors \"reject the assumption that the growth of international students 'caused' or exacerbated the housing crisis in Australia\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"International students only constituted a small part of the puzzle of the rental crisis in Australian capital cities,\" the University of South Australia research paper read.\n\n\n\n'There's really no pattern'\n\nLead researcher Michael Mu told SBS News his team looked at several different variables, including international student numbers, rental vacancy rates, inflation rates, and rental costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The main message here is, because the correlations between the international [students] numbers and the rental costs are random, there's really no pattern,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't have evidence that international students make finding housing harder for everyone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research also showed that, after COVID-19 mitigation measures were lifted, an increase of 10,000 international students led to corresponding decrease of $1 in weekly rents when \"rental inflation was controlled and rental vacancy rate was considered\".\n\n\n\nHu said \"very complicated macro-level socio-economic reasons\" were what was truly behind the housing crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[International students] are not the main competitors in the market, and actually, when some of them do choose to go to the private rental market, they are very vulnerable,\" he explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That perhaps helps to explain why we found really no statistical relationship between international members and the housing crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers examined data from government departments and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) over 70 time points between 2017 and 2024.\n\n\n\nInternational students are at a disadvantage in renting\n\nThe newest findings align with 2024 research from the Student Accommodation Council that also found international students weren't to blame for rising prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational students make up just six per cent of renters nationally, were concentrated in capital cities, and almost 40 per cent of them live in student housing, the council's research found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do have a rental crisis in Australia, and it's a long and systemic problem made up of a number of different factors, but to unfairly place the blame solely at the feet of international students is wrong,\" Tori Brown, the executive director of the Student Accommodation Council, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown also said that the organisation's research showed that international students were disadvantaged when competing in the private rental market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"International students have no previous rental history living in Australia, and they usually don't have jobs or income statements when they're putting in for leases.\"\n\n\n\nA 'tariff' on international students?\n\nMeanwhile, government efforts to reduce the number of international students studying in Australia appear to have had some effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the ABS, there were nearly 81,000 international student arrivals in January \u2014 2.5 per cent less than the same time last year and 10 per cent less than pre-COVID-19 numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the government tried to cap international student numbers and suggested limiting international student enrolments to 270,000 by 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan was scrapped after failing to win support from Opposition, Greens and independent senators .\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, the government introduced a new policy to slow visa processing and limit the number of international students a university can enrol.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was enforced through a ministerial direction rather than a bill.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Caps on international students won't just be a headache for universities\n\nThe Opposition is planning to unveil its own policy to limit the number of international students, with its education spokesperson Sarah Henderson saying it would consist of \"tougher, more effective caps on international students\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our approach will ensure you have long term certainty, underpinned with proper consultation, with special consideration for the regions where foreign students are integral to local economies,\" Henderson said at the Universities Australia Solutions Summit in mid-March.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts like UNSW economics professor Richard Holden warn that capping international students will \"definitely reduce GDP\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important to remember that each international student that comes to Australia not only brings in the tuition fees that they pay to the university, but they, they spend money in the rest of the economy,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's why they're in a really important part of our economic success story and our export success story.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the ABS, international education was Australia's fourth largest export \u2014 valued at $48 billion \u2014 in 2023. They paid $17 billion in course fees and spent $31 billion within the broader economy.\n\n\n\nThe Student Accommodation Council also opposes the cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown said that, as Australia's largest service export, international students \"can't have a tariff placed on them\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are critical to our economy and to Australia's future.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nChristie\u2019s auction house in New York has sold everything from Pablo Picasso to Princess Diana\u2019s dresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, it auctioned off 34 works including digital art sold as unique items knows as non-fungible tokens, and a self-painting robot that added to the canvas each time a new bid was made.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll artworks were generated using artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the first ever AI art sale at a major auction house.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jasmin Pfefferkorn is a Research Fellow at The University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe believes AI may increasingly become a reality at galleries in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we put it in a historical context, I think it is something that will eventually become embraced. I often liken it to photography which wasn\u2019t recognised as a legitimate art form for quite some time until it started to enter into museums and then into auction houses et cetera. I think we can see a similar, somewhat sped up trajectory for AI as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sale, titled Augmented Intelligence amassed over 1.1 million dollars [[US$700,000]], despite six of the artworks not selling.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also accumulated over 6,500 signatures by artists calling to cancel the auction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an open letter to the gallery, the letter said, \u201cif you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction. Yours sincerely, the undersigned artists.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Sue Beyer, the distinction isn\u2019t so clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a multi-disciplinary artist, she says developments in AI simultaneously fascinate and repel her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m using a lot of different new media and also AI. The AI, I really enjoy using because it\u2019s not perfect and I like its weaknesses. I\u2019m sort of treating like an oracle or not God, but I give the AI an instruction, or prompt and it gives me information in return. It\u2019s like a collaborative process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Beyer is even using the technology to learn more about herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019ve been using it is not really offensive or scary. Nothing like Black Mirror [[dystopian television series]] or The Terminator [[sci-fi movie]] or anything like that. I\u2019m asking questions like \u2018Who am I?\u2019 and \u2018Who is Sue Beyer?\u2019. I\u2019m sort of using irony because I\u2019m looking at what it means to be human using something that obviously isn\u2019t human.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Brisbane Portrait Prize announced it was changing its entry guidelines stating, \u201cit is impractical to have a blanket ban on the use of AI.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, it allowed entrants to submit artworks completely generated using image creation platforms like Midjourney or DALL-E.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving criticism by parts of the artistic community, organisers reconsidered its entry requirements to only allow works partly generated using AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, Dennis McCart\u2019s self-portrait using reprocessed AI images took home $10,000 for the Digital Award.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirrunga Wiradyuri, a Wiradjuri man and Founder of Birrunga Gallery won the competition's Packer Prize in 2021 for his portrait titled Night Rainbow.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis First Nations gallery boycotted the prize last year for its guidelines on AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he will not be entering the award again this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was really unfortunate, because I know there are some very reasonable people within that organisation. I just can\u2019t say I\u2019ve got a great deal of respect for the decisions made. It would have been very easy to go, \u2018Oh, ok. We hadn\u2019t considered that. It doesn\u2019t even have to be considered a real good point, just a reasonable point. Why don\u2019t time out on this?\u2019. Everyone would have gone \u2018Great decision, the Brisbane Portrait Prize listens to Blackfellas.\u2019 Instead, what we\u2019ve got is we\u2019re pressing on regardless because we\u2019ve got experts who say its harmless. I don\u2019t get it, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri believes it\u2019s not the change he opposed to.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, he says he\u2019s in favour of controversy and challenging messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not about censoring, I\u2019m not about that at all. I just feel as though at a minimum you should not do harm and at the moment, I can see this doing harm. So, there\u2019s this reckless notion that it\u2019s ok to harvest and reproduce First Nations artwork. The ramifications for that are next level cultural appropriation, cultural theft, it\u2019s colonisation, it\u2019s disenfranchisement, it\u2019s diminishing, it\u2019s diluting, it\u2019s invisible-ing us again, another level of invisible-ing us. I mean, that all adds up to false representation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri says cultural appropriation and stereotypical perceptions of First Nations art is a reality he still confronts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of his galleries Cultural Creative Development Program, he provides professional exposure for emerging Aboriginal and Torres Strait artists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means creating artworks for businesses' Reconciliation Action Plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wiradyuri says he still gets asked for traditional dot painting art.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a style derived from the Central and Western Desert regions of Australia - but not Wiradjuri in New South Wales, where he is from.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Louise Buckingham is the CEO of Arts Law Centre Australia, which provides specialised legal support to First Nations creators through its Artists in the Black service.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says with the rise of AI, cultural flattening and fake Indigenous art is rife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware of how important the Indigenous art market is and also how extensive the market for fake souvenirs and fake art has been alongside of that and the damage it does to our existing art market. You know, one set of stakeholders is benefiting to a greater extent than ever in the context and history of the technology boom and one group is losing out to a greater extent than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Stock, a graphics software that provides royalty free photos and graphics, has faced scrutiny by the National Indigenous Times for its representations of First Nations art and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nA search of \u2018Indigenous Australian\u2019 brings up images of people with generic body markings or wearing Native American feather headdresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople wearing business suits on the platform are quote \u201crepresenting workplace diversity\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nA search for \u2018Indigenous Australian art\u2019 surfaces images of didgeridoos and boomerangs, AI rock and dot style paintings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extended licence for each of these AI images costs nearly 90 dollars on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Australia\u2019s current legislation, copyright for artistic works generally last the lifetime of the creator plus 70 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Buckingham says while this may seem like an extensive period, for First Nations communities whose art and culture moves across past, present and future, it can raise issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of AI-generated art, it gets more complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, copyright law does not subsist or exist for artificial intelligence, as legally, there is considered to be no human authorship or originality to protect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also means that concerns over how AI models are being trained using artists' works are difficult to legislate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe responses to things like the Christie\u2019s auction which received a lot more in sales than people anticipated, but it also elicited a response from creators who were outraged that the notion of an auction for this kind of artwork. You know, there have been other responses from all around the world from creators of all descriptions and when we are talking about visual art, and we have class action complaints in the US that we will be watching very closely here in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA working group on Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property was established in December last year, to protect First Nations knowledge amidst the rise of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Buckingham says consultation from the working group has already been paused until after the federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, The University of Chicago has developed tools like Nightshade or Glaze, which are being used by artists to fight back against AI data scraping.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese tools transform data from images into \u201cpoison\u201d, so that AI training on them without consent learn unpredictable behaviours.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this software, the university says a prompt that asks for an image of a cow flying in space might instead get an image of a handbag in space.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Pfefferkorn from the Art, AI and Digital Ethics centre believes while AI is new, artists have been balancing the relationship between ethics, technology and science for centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really hopeful the more we engage critically and with the different complexities that are being presented and already have been explored by artists in this space for such a long time, the more we\u2019ll be able to push back and reclaim some of our agency because we will be able to see there are alternatives and other options.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nStanding alongside Prime Minister Anthony Albanese this morning, Crisafulli said: \u201cI reckon we spoke a lot about it. But we\u2019ve negotiated well together.

    "text": "Despite the worst fears among residents, the major Sydney council told Yahoo the tree won't be going anywhere just yet.\n\nEyebrows were raised after two yellow crosses appeared on this tree in Manly on Friday. Source: Matt Abbott/Facebook\n\nA beachside community in an affluent city suburb is concerned for the fate of a \"beloved\" native tree, likely many decades old, after it was found marked with two ominous \"yellow Xs\".\n\nManly locals living in the North Steyne area on Sydney's Northern Beaches unleashed by the hundreds on social media over the weekend, after they suspected the gumtree, located on Pittwater Road, had been marked for imminent removal.\n\n\"Woke up this morning to find two yellow Xs sprayed onto the gumtree outside our place. Called the council\u2014apparently, it\u2019s being removed after a 'safety complaint.' Sure, it leans a bit, but how it poses a risk to the community is beyond me,\" a resident said.\n\n\"For some it might just be another tree. But for those of us who live here, it is the quirky tree on the way to the shops, the tree kids carved their names into and the tree someone once stuck a bandaid on when it was leaking sap.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat started as a single post quickly turned into a heated discussion about tree removals around the Northern Beaches, with the general sentiment summed up by one remark: \"The richer this place gets, the more pedestrian and soulless it becomes.\"\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News, a Northern Beaches Council spokeswoman eventually clarified the reasoning for the Xs, but not before hundreds hit out.\n\nLocals suspected the crosses meant the tree had been marked for removal. Source: Matt Abbott/Facebook\n\nLocals outraged after suspecting beloved tree marked for removal\n\nIn a rare level of interest for a post about a single tree, the discussion attracted almost 600 responses. Many argued that native trees, particularly older ones, deserve protection and respect.\n\n\"Nooo, I love this tree! It brings beauty to the street, keeps the area cool in the hot summer days, and should not be chopped down due to some people not happy with having to walk around it,\" a woman argued. \"It does not cut off access, there\u2019s still a clear pathway with plenty of space near the fence.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"More people ... buying into the area and chopping down their backyard trees everywhere,\" a second said.\n\n\"Very frustrating as it is clearly a relatively old tree. So important for birds and wildlife to have older trees that are more likely to have hollows. Just removing an older, established tree and replacing it with a new sapling just doesn't cut it,\" a third chimed in.\n\n\"Oh no! Is that the quirky tree on Pittwater Road that makes me smile every time I walk past it? I just want to touch it because it just looks happy\".\n\n\"I love that tree. Such a shame,\" echoed another.\n\nNorthern Beaches Council sets record straight\n\nWhile the future looked bleak for the \"quirky\" gum, the council spokeswoman confirmed it'll be staying put for now. Council confirmed to Yahoo that while a large branch had fallen from the tree, it's not currently dangerous and won't be removed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSteps will be taken to ensure its health and prevent further issues, she said, and the crosses that were placed on the tree will be erased to avoid any confusion. The Northern Beaches has one of the greatest tree canopies in metropolitan in Sydney \u2014 an estimated 12 million in fact \u2014 and council said it continues to take action to protect, retain and maintain them.\n\nWhile this local issue clearly generated a lot of buzz from within the community, it's a topic many Australians feel strongly about. Across the country, the removal of trees often sparks heated debates, despite the issue sometimes seeming trivial to those not directly involved.\n\nTrees, particularly mature ones, hold significant cultural, environmental, and aesthetic value to many Australians. They are seen as symbols of the country\u2019s natural heritage, often serving as habitats for wildlife and contributing to local ecosystems. For others, trees can be a source of community pride, providing shade and beauty.\n\nWhen it comes to tree removal, people often express strong opinions, especially when trees are removed for development, land clearing or due to safety concerns.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

    "text": "Shai Howland and Nathan Greenshields likely exposed themselves to asbestos in their new home in South Australia. Source: TikTok and Instagram/shaihowland\n\nA growing number of Aussies are keen to showoff their renovation skills online as they navigate first-time home ownership. However a perfectly innocuous moment between one couple has highlighted the potential hidden danger of doing it yourself after they unwittingly got up close and personal with materials that likely contained asbestos.\n\nShai Howland and Nathan Greenshields recently bought an old home in South Australia and were spending their weekend pulling off old wallpaper when they suddenly realised they were putting themselves at serious risk.\n\n\"I had mentioned to my partner about the amount of dust in the room which prompted him to research the wallpaper we were taking down,\" Shai told Yahoo News, recalling the moment when the penny dropped.\n\n\"He looked up whether there was anything to be cautious about when taking down old wallpaper. It was then he found that there was a likely chance the wallpaper and adhesive had been made using asbestos.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe moment of revelation was captured on camera, with the pair wearing shorts and tops without any protective clothing or masks on at the time.\n\n\"We had already ripped sheets down, we were immediately concerned we had now disturbed the particles, and were exposed without any protective clothing,\" Shai said, saying it was a harsh lesson about \"being non-diligent\".\n\n\"Anxiety ... and a lot of asbestos Google searches later, we've learnt our lesson.\"\n\nThe majority of Aussie homes built before the 1980s are likely to include asbestos. Source: TikTok/shaihowland\n\n'Highly likely' Aussie homes built before 1980s contain asbestos\n\nAsbestos was commonly used in building materials throughout the 1900s and it was added to wallpaper because of its durability and fire-resistance, particularly in vinyl wallpaper used in rooms that got hot, such as kitchens and bathrooms.\n\nIt is \"highly likely\" homes built in South Australia before the mid-1980s include asbestos-containing materials, according to the state's SafeWork website.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn New South Wales, 1 in 3 homes constructed between 1945 and 1990 are estimated to contain asbestos, and in Queensland it's not any better \u2014 with asbestos used as a binding product for a wide range of building materials in a 40-year period during the century.\n\nAsbestos can be found in walls, roofs, electrical boxes, fences, bathrooms, kitchens, wallpaper and under floors, and while the law does not require homeowners to have licences to remove asbestos-containing materials, the risk to health is huge. Disturbing materials that contain asbestos can result in the dusty particles contaminating a property and, when breathed in, can cause serious or even fatal diseases such as lung cancer or asbestosis. A short period of exposure is all it takes.\n\nThis was the case for Steve Wilcockson who was exposed to asbestos for just a few weeks when he was 14. The Sydney man later died aged 72 after developing mesothelioma, an aggressive form of cancer linked to asbestos inhalation.\n\nGet an asbestos expert to help renovations\n\nWhile many Aussies taking part in online home renovation trends are trying to update their homes on a budget, the safest course of action is to get an expert for asbestos removal. Or, at the very least, to identify if their home has asbestos in it before rolling up their sleeves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt can be assumed that asbestos is in wallpaper when it has flexible curls in the upper corners or it looks to have a vinyl or plastic coating with a paper backing. Markers also include the property being built before 1980 or the wallpaper's manufacturing label is dated between the known decades asbestos was commonly in use.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
