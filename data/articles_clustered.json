(Dominic Lorrimer)\n\nHow do you start the day to set yourself up for success?\n\nI like to go for a run or a ride or do some exercise, and then I get stuck into it.\n\nI'm of South African heritage, so I check my WhatsApp from family and friends because the time difference. And sometimes, if it's Monday, I catch up on a little bit of sports news.\n\nBut I'm not one for cold plunges and meditations. I like to just get into the day.\n\nWhat are three daily habits you always stick to?\n\nI write down what I need to do, what my priorities are for the day. That's the first thing I do so I'm very clear about what is it that I want to achieve today.\n\nI make sure that I check in with important people, starting with my wife and kids, and then when I get into the office. It's just making sure that the connection is there, whether it's a quick call on the way in or a visit to someone's office \u2013 I prefer face-to-face to email.\n\nAnd then I make sure that I leave my desk at the end of the day being clear with what I've achieved and what's coming up for the next day. It'll involve a quick scan of the diary to make sure that I don't have anything outstanding.\n\nJones said getting a promotion or a new job is about proving you'll do it well. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nLots of Aussies are looking for a career change \u2013 what small action can help them get ahead of other candidates?\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to do a good job.\n\nI tell my children this all the time; having a job is a privilege, not a right. And I think that delivering 10 times the value of your salary is where you should start.\n\nIt's probably boring and old-fashioned advice, but that's the first thing and frankly, that opens up opportunities. Whether you're looking for a career change or a promotion, people around you are looking to work with people that get stuff done, and that do it in a way that's collaborative and pleasant.\n\nSo yes, you should do stuff you're interested in, yes, you should do stuff you're good at, but at the end of the day, you should do things where you can add genuine value.\n\nSurprise entrant to top 10 most trusted brands in Australia View Gallery\n\nWhat financial myth do you wish you never bought into?\n\nI was brought up in a fairly strict environment, and my parents were always very smart about teaching me not to live beyond my means, so I think credit should be used appropriately.\n\nCredit is good at the right time, but only if you can pay back that credit.\n\nWhat do you wish you could tell your 20-year-old self?\n\nDon't be so serious.\n\nThe world is a wonderful place and if you approach it with curiosity, integrity, passion and humility, I think that you can have an amazing career and life.\n\nHave you got a story?

    "text": "As the weather heats up, the temptation to switch on the air conditioner gets stronger.\n\nBut with the cool air comes the higher bills.\n\nAnd power bills remain one of the most unwelcome costs Australians are facing.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to save electricity, but some are better than others.\n\nSo what are the most power-hungry appliances in the average house?\n\nHeating\n\nChanging the temperature of a room is the most effective way of getting a higher electricity bill.\n\nIt's estimated 40 per cent of household electricity use goes towards heating and cooling - though some use far more or less than others.\n\nWhen you buy a space heater, you are usually paying for it later.\n\nThe cheap shelf price betrays how much power they use.\n\nAir conditioner is a major electricity user. (Getty)\n\nBut air conditioners aren't the best option either.\n\nIt's possible someone can pay hundreds of dollars more each year just from air conditioning alone.\n\nCeiling fans are a far more efficient option, even if they aren't as effective.\n\nBut if you have both, you should use the fan while you have the air-con on.\n\nHot water\n\nAn average of 23 per cent of household electricity goes towards hot water.\n\nThe solution is simple but not necessarily easy - shorter showers.\n\nWater-saving showerheads make a big difference, but there's a very easy hack to save power.\n\nWater loses heat as it moves, so by moving the showerhead closer to your body, the water will be warmer.\n\nOther tips include filling up the kettle with cold water or using the cold cycle on the washing machine.\n\nPerhaps the most efficient ways to conserve power is to take shorter showers. (Getty)\n\nFridges\n\nIt's the biggest appliance in the house and it's on all the time, so of course the fridge is a big culprit when it comes to high power bills.\n\nEnsuring the seals are in good condition can be a power-saver, as well as limiting the amount of times you open and close it.\n\nAnd you should try and avoid buying a bigger fridge than what you need.\n\nBut oddly enough, having more food in your fridge means it should use slightly less power than an empty fridge.\n\nThe other big power saver is the spare fridge in the garage.\n\nIf you're only using it for drinks at big parties, you should switch it off at other times.\n\nA crowded fridge uses less power than an empty fridge. (Supplied)\n\nWashers and dryers\n\nFront-loading washing machines are usually better for electricity than top-loaders, though they do cost more to buy.\n\nBut the best way to save power in the laundry is to use cold water in the washing machine rather than hot or warm.\n\nAnd hanging your clothes on the line uses no electricity, compared to putting them in the dryer.\n\nThe laundry is a major user of electricity in the household. (Getty)\n\nDishwashers\n\nYou may have seen ads on TV talking about how dishwashers use less water than washing your dishes in the sink.\n\nThat's not true for electricity.\n\nBut you can maximise your dishwasher efficiency by putting it on an eco wash.\n\nBetter yet, wait until the dishwasher is full until you turn it on.\n\nYou shouldn't put your dishwasher on until it is full. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOvens\n\nThere's not much you can do to save power when it comes to ovens, save for the decision you make when you buy it.\n\nBut minimising your preheat time is a good way to save power.\n\nIt's also smart to be cooking more than one thing at a time in the oven if you can help it.\n\nYou shouldn't preheat your oven for longer than necessary. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nTVs\n\nThe bigger the TV, the more electricity it tends to use - but new LCD screens are more efficient than old plasmas.\n\nBut there's not much that you can do to save power with your existing TV - save for turning it off when you're not watching it.\n\nTVs, gaming consoles, DVD players and other devices tend to use low levels of power when in stand-by mode.\n\nSo switching them off at the power point when they aren't being used is a smart choice.\n\nAs obvious as it seems, you should turn your TV off when you're not watching it. (Getty)\n\nSmaller appliances\n\nUsing a smaller appliance instead of a bigger one is normally the savvier choice.\n\nA slow cooker, air fryer or microwave is better than an oven because they are heating less space or for a shorter time.\n\nAnd boiling water in an electric kettle is more energy efficient than a stovetop option.",

(ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nThey are often working in extreme environments such as unrelenting weather conditions, high heat or smoke, which can exacerbate negative impacts on their physical and mental health.\n\nThey do it all without expecting a cent in return. Why?\n\nAt the Mundaring Bushfire Brigade, Kelvin Portland and Luke McCall are at different ends of their volunteer firefighting careers, but they have a similar answer.\n\nFor many volunteers, decades-long motivation comes from the deep roots of knowing they've made a genuine impact on people's lives.\n\nBut duty comes with its fair share of sacrifices.\n\nVolunteers like Kelvin Portland face traumatic events. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nFire and rescue volunteers are subject to constant exposure to traumatic events such as large-scale incidents, road crashes and distressed members of the public who are often facing the worst day of their lives.\n\nThrough repeatedly witnessing and hearing about the experiences of others, they risk exposing themselves to further trauma, which can leave devastating impacts.\n\n'Just go through your steps'\n\nIn the darkest moments, Kelvin focuses on carrying out what he learnt in training to detach himself from what's unfolding in front of his eyes.\n\n\"Trying to get them out of a vehicle, or out of the house, or something like that. You've got to just go through your steps,\" he said.\n\nKelvin (left) undertaking training. (Supplied: DFES)\n\nLuke McCall said the resilience of his colleagues motivates him.\n\nIt's something he witnessed around the time of his cadetship, when a bushfire flattened the town of Yarloop.\n\nThe situation was volatile as a fierce and rapidly spreading fire raged from the hills down to the town, causing widespread destruction and leaving hundreds homeless.\n\nThe devastating Yarloop bushfire in 2016. (Supplied: DFES)\n\nIt completely drained and exhausted first responders.\n\n\"What have I got myself into?\" Luke asked himself.\n\nBut what he saw helped him find a sense of strength.\n\n\"They [my colleagues] just kept going and going and so I suppose if they can do it I could do it,\" he said.\n\nLuke McCall has formed a close bond with his fellow volunteers. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\n\"[To] actually be involved and helping out is probably the most rewarding part.\"\n\n'My second family'\n\nOne of the continuous motivators for Luke is the camaraderie and bonds forged within the team.\n\n\"The way I look at it now is that they're my second family,\" he said.\n\nLuke McCall says his colleagues motivate him. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\n\"You've got to always have someone to fall back on. It doesn't matter what kind of issue it is, whether it's personal or you just want to have a talk with someone.\"\n\nIt's that sense of community and duty that has helped volunteer bushfire brigades operate for decades \u2014 and there's always a need for new members.\n\n\"It's the survival of our brigade,\" Kelvin said.\n\n\"I can't remember the last new member we had, it was quite a while ago.\n\nKelvin can't remember the last time they had a new member at their brigade. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\n\"A lot of people are interested in that and ask, but really don't take that next leap by actually coming down.\"\n\nCreating pathways\n\nDepartment of Fire and Emergency Services Deputy Commissioner Craig Waters says the agency is trying to make volunteering more accessible to people.\n\nMore people are needed on the frontline. (Supplied: DFES)\n\n\"This includes creating flexible roles to better fit in with people's busy lives, and a clear pathway for cadets and junior members to become active firefighters with their local brigade once they're old enough,\" he said.\n\nHow to defend your home Fire agencies recommend that you develop a bushfire survival plan. If you decide to stay and defend your home, there are some important things to consider.\n\nIt's a tough ask \u2014 acknowledging volunteers must put their own lives on hold to turn out to an unfolding disaster at a moment's notice.\n\n\"They show bravery and unwavering dedication to keeping communities safe without expecting acknowledgement or thanks,\" Commissioner Waters said.\n\nIn WA, 93 per cent of the state is highly bushfire prone, with dry terrain and native vegetation creating a highly susceptible environment, especially around the Darling Range, otherwise known as Katta Moorda, where the Mundaring brigade is based.\n\nLuke joined through the cadet program nine years ago and said it had helped him immensely with his communication skills.\n\nLuke addresses new cadets at the Mundaring Volunteer Fire Brigade. (Supplied: DFES)\n\n\"I feel like school's very lacking with that side of stuff, whereas cadets, you're forced to be talking to not just people your age, but older people with experience.\"\n\nWhen a bushfire reached Kay's suburban home, she wasn't ready After a fast-moving bushfire reached the front door of her home in 2023, Kay Douglas is now better prepared in case it happens again.\n\nKelvin remembers what it was like when Luke joined the brigade.\n\n\"So shy, so quiet and we can't have that on the fire ground, you need a loud voice so we sort of basically drummed that into him and we do it with all the other cadets too \u2014 and now boy, he's got a good voice now, it's pretty loud.\"\n\nDespite the increasing challenges, Kelvin has no plans to retire and is determined to continue helping others.\n\n\"You get that feeling that I have done something, I have achieved something in my life,\" he said.\n\nLoading...",

(Getty Images via AFP: Vince Bucci)\n\nThe Cure \u2014 whose 66-year-old frontman Robert Smith is famous for his innovative approach to music as well as on-stage stamina \u2014 has transformed itself throughout its prolific decades-spanning existence.\n\nWhen The Cure formed in 1976, Bamonte was initially part of its road crew from 1984 before enjoying two stints as a musical member, playing guitar, six-string bass, and keyboard.\n\nThe first, from 1990, spanned 14 years; the second stint was from 2022 onwards.\n\nIn its statement, The Cure noted he had helped create numerous albums, including Wish, Wild Mood Swings, Bloodflowers, Acoustic Hits, and The Cure.\n\nHe performed in more than 400 shows during his first 14-year period in the band, and then played another 90 after rejoining three years ago, it added.\n\nThose later gigs were \"some of the best in the band's history\", the statement said.\n\nBassist Simon Gallop and Perry Bamonte during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2004. (Getty Images via AFP: Kevin Winter)\n\nLed by Smith's plaintive, wailing voice and rich guitar textures, The Cure helped shape Goth rock with albums including 1982's Pornography, which was full of suicidal imagery.\n\nThe band later had hits with much cheerier material, including Friday I'm in Love.\n\nIt had kept up touring, but before last year's release of Songs of a Lost World, it had not released a new studio album since 2008's 4:13 Dream.\n\nThe band's former drummer, Lol Tolhurst, said in a tribute posted on Instagram that he was \"so sad\" to learn of Bamonte's death, adding that he and his wife \"send our condolences to all that knew him\".\n\n\"Farewell Teddy,\" he added.\n\nBamonte was also the bass player in supergroup Love Amongst Ruin, which has released two studio albums.\n\nAFP",

(ABC Open Riverland)\n\nNew co-owners Lisa and David Goodland have taken the Pedders' efforts to the next level, modernising and refurbishing it into a cafe and bar venue.\n\nMr and Mrs Pedder bought the station and an attached 260 hectares in 2002.\n\nThey were handed the keys and \"two books' worth of problems\", which held the site's dilapidation survey.\n\n\"It was like our Bible to restore the place because it gave us everything that was wrong with [it],\" Mr Pedder said.\n\nThe couple had always enjoyed holidaying by the river and, after retiring, decided to move there permanently, taking on the restoration project as a \"full-time job\".\n\n\"It took us eight years before we could actually shift into the main homestead and do all the outbuildings and get it all back to [being] liveable,\" Mr Pedder said.\n\nThe old roof on the Nor' West Bend homestead was falling down when Kevin and Sue Pedder bought the property in the early 2000s.

(Supplied: Kevin Pedder)\n\n\"It was like a mini town because it was there about five years before [the town of] Morgan existed \u2026 which was called North West Bend at the time,\" Mr Pedder said.\n\nWhen the Pedders arrived, most of the roof on the main homestead had been destroyed by the weather and white ants.\n\nThe couple outsourced about half of the restoration work and did the rest themselves, staying on the property for almost 20 years.\n\nNor' West Bend Station was established in 1850. The original lease was for 43 square miles of land by the River Murray. (Supplied: Lisa Goodland)\n\n\"We tried to keep it as close to original as possible \u2026 right down to the original stove that we found in the dump and had restored and put back into the kitchen,\" he said.\n\nWith the property being heritage-listed and with previous links to the National Trust, Mr Pedder said every adjustment was run by the organisation to ensure renovations were historically accurate.\n\n\"We had the 150th anniversary [while we owned it] and thought if we can get this to last another 150 years, it would be fantastic,\" Mr Pedder said.\n\nStepping back in time\n\nNor' West Bend has seen droughts, floods, prosperous years, and everything in between since its establishment in 1850.\n\nIts early days as a cattle and then sheep station were tough for some and rewarding for others, with six different owners in the first 30 years of its establishment.\n\nA sketch of the main homestead at Nor' West Bend from 1909, by Mrs L Hines.

Others made huge fortunes. \"\n\nOne notable owner was Alexander Hay, a prominent South Australian merchant, pastoralist and politician, who purchased the station in 1876.\n\n\"He built the mansion down at Victor Harbor called Mount Breckan out of one year's wool clip from Nor' West Bend,\" Mr Pedder said.\n\nCharles Campbell, an early settler of Adelaide whom the suburb of Campbelltown is named after, also owned the station for the last years of his life in the late 1850s.\n\nHe died there in 1859 after an infection and complications from a minor cut on his hand.\n\nDavid and Lisa Goodland have built on Kevin and Sue Pedder's restoration work, making it into a cafe and bar venue.

(ABC News: Emily Anderson)\n\n\"People found other things to do, moved on in life and just got old and chose not to play broomball again, and we've been really struggling since then,\" McLennan said.\n\nHe said low participation had made costs like insurance and rink hire unaffordable.\n\n\"If we don't get a big influx in the next six months, we're not going to have enough numbers to cover the costs,\" McLennan said.\n\nA national issue\n\nBroomball Australia president Jeff Ferrara said there were only 300 regular broomball players across the country.\n\nTownsville, Sydney, Canberra and Adelaide are the only four cities with regular broomball competitions.\n\nBroomball players competing in the Australian National Broomball Championships during the early 2000s. (Supplied: Mark McLennan)\n\nFerrara said a lack of ice rinks was a major reason people had left the sport.\n\nAfter the New South Wales association's home ice rink in Penrith permanently closed in 2022, the closest rink they could use was an hour and a half away on the Central Coast.\n\n\"Player count is down mainly because of a lack of ice time in general,\" Ferrara said.\n\n\"All the people we once had playing for us, it's so difficult for them to go and play.\"\n\nHe believed the solution was government funding for ice rinks to make venues financially viable and offer a venue for ice sports.\n\nWarrina Ice Rink in Townsville is the only ice rink north of Brisbane in Queensland. (ABC News: Emily Anderson)\n\n\"They almost need to be viewed in the same way an indoor stadium would be viewed, where it's owned by the local government or state government and funded like another facility would be,\" Ferrara said.\n\n\"Without these things, you don't have anywhere for the community to do their thing.\"\n\nBut Ferrara remained hopeful that love of the sport would keep it alive and said the national championships remained a popular event for players around the country.\n\nThe National Broomball Championships are scheduled for April 2026.",

    "text": "Not many people who lose a partner can keep them alive, unless you're a writer.\n\nAnthony Nocera was at university and doing a subject on electronic writing in 2015 when he decided to combine that with his love life, by testing out dating apps.\n\nIt was there he met Jamie Anderson, a larger-than-life character who was 24 years older than him.\n\n\"He was like, 'Are you a good writer?' and I was like, yeah, and so we went on a date and I read him some of my writing and that became seven years of my life,\" he remembered.\n\nIt was during that time that his play Log Boy started to take shape.\n\nNocera's inspiration and writing were based on Jamie's Tuesday catch-ups with his close friend Justin, conversations that Nocera thought were so ridiculous and funny that he began surreptitiously recording them on his phone.\n\nAnthony Nocera spent seven memorable years with late partner Jamie Anderson (left). (Supplied)\n\n\"There was a quality to them in that they were haunted by a lot of the loss that they'd experienced by virtue of the fact they came to sexual prominence during the AIDS crisis,\" he explained.\n\n\"It was quite a chaotic time, they'd lost a lot of people and they'd lost a lot of time in their life.\"\n\nThus was born his manuscript, with the three main characters; Anthony, Jamie and Justin.\n\nHolding a full-time job in the arts as a publicist and marketer, Nocera would find any spare moment he could to work on it.\n\n\"Quite often he [Jamie] would fall asleep before me and I would sit in bed next to him writing it and then the next day I would give him scenes and he'd read it and be like, 'You've made me into a monster darl,'\" Nocera laughed.\n\n\" But he loved it, it was something we did together and something he was really excited by. \"\n\nIn the play, the character Anthony loses his fiance Michael.\n\nIt was based on the playwright's thought of one day potentially losing Jamie, given the big difference in their ages.\n\nAnthony Nocera's breakthrough play Log Boy holds a special place in his heart. (ABC News: Guido Salazar)\n\nThen the play came horribly to life in late 2022. Jamie had been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and responded well to chemotherapy.\n\nBut he later picked up an infection and passed away from complications.\n\nWhile grieving, Nocera knew he could not put his project on hold.\n\n\"After he passed away I completely rewrote the play to reflect my own experience of loss,\" he said.\n\nIronically, Nocera had always had Jamie as the third character in Log Boy, because he could not bear the thought of killing him off.\n\n\"While the character of Jamie in Log Boy is very different to the real Jamie that lived, the idea that he can live on in a small way as a little testament to him and the immense impact he's had in my life is really special,\" he said.\n\nJamie still has a unique place in Nocera's everyday life.\n\n\"I also just feel him around, like I live in a house we built together, his ashes are in the house and I still keep some of his clothes, he's still the wallpaper on my phone and I hear him every day,\" he admitted.\n\nAnthony Nocera and Jamie Anderson living it up in New York. (Supplied)\n\nBut that connection has not stopped Nocera from finding a new partner.\n\n\"One of the strangest things about meeting someone new after you've lost someone, is the one thing I really want to do is tell Jamie about it,\" he said.\n\n\"About the fact that I've met a really great guy called Billy and I think they'd really get along which is kind of nice and very strange,\" he said.\n\nLog Boy will be part of State Theatre South Australia's 2026 season, with Nocera continue raising some of the funds to stage the production.\n\nThe playwright can see there being an extra audience member when the curtain goes up in early October.\n\n\"Jamie loved attention, so absolutely, I will feel his presence, he'll definitely be there to see that we've done him justice,\" Nocera said with a chuckle.",

    "text": "Tim David has produced a match-saving knock before injuring his hamstring in Hobart's four-wicket BBL victory over the Perth Scorchers at Perth Stadium.\n\nThe Scorchers wasted a solid start on the way to making 8-150 in Friday night's match, with Finn Allen (43 off 23 balls), Nick Hobson (29 off 23) and Laurie Evans (27 off 18) the main contributors.\n\nIn reply, the Hurricanes slumped to 3-39 following an early onslaught from Cooper Connolly (3-23) before David (42 off 28 balls) and Nikhil Chaudhary (34 off 30) put Hobart back in the box seat.\n\nBut in an unexpected twist, David pinged his hamstring while running for a single in the 15th over, forcing him to retire hurt with the scoreboard reading 4-103.\n\nMac Wright (22no off 13 balls) and Chris Jordan (15 off 11 balls) stepped up to the plate to help guide Hobart home with three balls to spare in front of 42,620 fans.\n\nHobart needed 14 runs for victory with eight balls remaining, before Wright \u2014 who was replacing the rested Matthew Wade \u2014 cracked Aaron Hardie for a six and a four off consecutive balls to ease the pressure.\n\n\"I'm very happy for Mac,\" Hobart captain Nathan Ellis said.\n\n\"He was sort of a bit of a last-minute call-up with Matthew Wade falling out of the squad.\n\n\"He would have been thinking about Christmas ham and chilling on the couch. To get a phone call and fly over to Perth, and find yourself in a tense game needing to get the boys over the line (is big).\n\n\"He's had some ups and downs in the last 18 months, coming back from an ACL reconstruction. I'm just really proud of him.\"\n\nHardie finished with figures of 0-42 off three overs in a tough night for the all-rounder.\n\n\"Look, it's T20 cricket, everyone can have an off day sometimes,\" Allen said.\n\n\"And you know, we back Hards, we know he's an incredible player.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes improved their record to 3-1, but David's injury is a huge blow to their hopes of defending their title.\n\nThe BBL final is held on January 25, meaning David faces a race against time to return this season.\n\nThe Scorchers entered the match looking to atone for their shock loss to Brisbane, when Perth failed to defend 6-257.\n\nAllen ensured they got off to a fast start, but when he was caught on the boundary to leave the Scorchers at 3-73 in the ninth over, it signalled the end of Perth's attacking potency.\n\nRiley Meredith (2-19 off four overs) was Hobart's most economical bowler, with his most important scalp being that of star opener Mitch Marsh (16 off 13).\n\nSpinner Rishad Hossain (3-33) was the most destructive, snaring a trio of danger men in the form of Connolly (6), Hardie (9) and Evans.\n\nThe Scorchers needed to make an early dent, and Connolly was called upon to open the bowling.\n\nConnolly's first delivery was whacked for six by Mitch Owen (6), but the danger man was out next ball when he cut an easy catch to point.\n\nJoel Paris sent Tim Ward packing for four, and when Connolly trapped Ben McDermott plumb LBW after a failed reverse sweep, Hobart were in all sorts of trouble, before David helped launch the rescue mission.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nIn the other game, the Melbourne Stars remained unbeaten on top of the table with a comfortable seven-wicket win over the Sydney Sixers at the SCG.\n\nThe Sixers made 144 from their 20 overs, led by 60 off 42 balls from opener Daniel Hughes, but the total was never enough.\n\nThe Stars looked in some trouble early thanks to some tight bowling, but once wicketkeeper-batsman Sam Harper got going, there was always going to be one result.\n\nHarper smashed 12 fours and six sixes in his first-ever BBL century, making an unbeaten 110 off 60 balls to get his side home with 15 balls to spare.\n\nAAP/ABC",

    "text": "\u201cTo be part of the Asia Cup, everyone wants to do that, but ... I just can\u2019t really put the pressure on myself and see it from that angle,\u201d Freier said. \u201cThe Tillies support my decision, but I think I knew it would always be a risk ... I\u2019m trying to use this whole experience as a positive one. \u201cComing home and playing for the Roar, it\u2019s putting me more in the right direction.\u201d Juggling two lives\n\nAs Freier prepared to return home, her twin sister Laini made a shock decision of her own. Despite earning her maiden Matildas cap, she announced her retirement to focus on other career ambitions and family life. \u201cLaini and I are super close so I know how she felt and was feeling for a while,\u201d Sharn Freier said. Twin sisters Sharn and Laini Freier with their mother. \u201cShe had an unreal first professional football season, accomplished a lot in that short time, but I just knew it wasn\u2019t really what she wanted.\u201d \u201cThe pressure of needing to be not full-time, but at training for as long as we need to be, and working a full-time gig \u2026 she\u2019s happy with what she\u2019s doing now.\u201d\n\nThe average A-League Women\u2019s salary sits around $30,000, and many players essentially juggle two careers \u2013 one that can include disruptions from injury \u2013 to keep up with the cost of living. Loading Freier admits the stress can take a toll. \u201cThe pressure is already there in terms of working, then you go and add an injury or can\u2019t perform in your workplace, and it definitely adds some pressure and takes a toll for most players,\u201d she said. \u201cI think playing in Australia, you really have to love the game. There are a lot of sacrifices.\u201d\n\nHolistic player protection is a paramount focus of the A-League\u2019s new chief medical officer, Dr Sharon Stay. She has sought to ensure every club has access to sideline video surveillance and daily data collection capabilities, to support the juggling act the game\u2019s female athletes endure. \u201cWe want every training session, we want gym-based sessions, we want rest day numbers,\u201d Stay said. \u201cIf someone\u2019s got gastro on a Tuesday, the problem needs to go in our stats. \u201cThese are lives of players we\u2019re managing for 10 to 11 months of the year. There needs to be a little bit more education and key spending on initiatives addressing what the players are exposed to.\u201d\n\nNurturing the next generation Freier\u2019s homecoming has come with a unique experience: being in the elder class of a Roar squad whose average age is 22. Teenage strikers Daisy Brown and Grace Kuilamu have caught Freier\u2019s eye, while Isabela Hoyos (17) and Ruby Cuthbert (18) loom as the future of the club\u2019s defence. With youth comes a challenge in player welfare, with Stay revealing A-League Women\u2019s players experience approximately two to three times more ACL ruptures than men. Stay believes the growing base of teenage prospects has contributed to these figures, with the peak risk of knee ruptures occurring between ages 14 and 17 for women.\n\n\u201cThese girls often tend to be the really sporty girls at school, so they play multiple sports. It\u2019s great for body and physical development and athleticism as a whole, but they are often pulled in many different directions,\u201d she said. Matildas star Mary Fowler was among the several Australian women\u2019s players who ruptured her ACL this year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThese kids may not have had the specialised football development we sometimes see if you took a 20-year-old guy, who would have hundreds and thousands more hours of football-specific development.\u201d In calling for careful management of the demands these players faced, Stay admits it is a battle when seasons and careers are on the line. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the same of a 15-year-old that you can from a 25-year-old,\u201d she said.",

Credit: Sailing Inukshuk\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t move. It took us probably 45 minutes to clear the thing,\u201d Large said.\n\nAfter finally pulling the net off, Large was concerned his boat may have sustained rudder damage, which would have made it risky to sail the remaining 610 nautical miles.\n\nLarge and Ebbott made the difficult decision to turn back to the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia in Darling Point and retire from the Hobart on the afternoon of Boxing Day.\n\n\u201cI had to put safety ahead of the race,\u201d Large said. \u201cI felt it was more prudent to return rather than continue sailing, where if the rudder failed further down, we could be into some serious problems.\u201d\n\nAn Australian resident for nearly 20 years, Canadian native Large has sailed in six previous Sydney to Hobarts and is experienced with preparing a boat for the race. But no amount of money, spare parts or physical training could have saved Inukshuk from the errant fishing net.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all bad luck,\u201d Large said. \u201cYou prepare for everything, you carry spares which you need to prepare the boat for the seas that you\u2019re going to be getting, we prepare ourselves psychologically and physically to do the race.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of money and a lot of time, six or eight months of work to get a boat ready, to keep checking everything, re-checking it, training.\n\n\u201cThree hours into the race and having to stop for a reason like that is pretty hard to take.\u201d\n\nLarge and Ebbott are hopeful of sailing Inukshuk in a fifth Hobart next year and are planning to contest the trans-Tasman Yacht Race in late February. Before then, Large will fly down to Hobart, reunite with his wife and join in the post-race festivities.\n\n\u201cWe figure we\u2019ve done enough Hobarts we can justify it, we\u2019ve earned a place,\u201d Large said.\n\nInukshuk previously withdrew from the 2021 Hobart after reporting auto-pilot issues.\n\nThe boat\u2019s name is an Inuit word meaning \u201ca structure of rough stones stacked in the form of a human figure\u201d, with such figures traditionally used as a landmark or commemorative sign.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "So here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: some of this nonsense appears to actually work. Not because Jupiter has anything to do with equities or any other market, but because human behaviour and history do. And ironically, charting human behaviour is also the basis of all technical analysis. Markets run on pattern-seeking and historically December is when those patterns hit overdrive.\n\nTraders see signs in charts where no real fundamental support exists. And then, like a self-fulfilling prophecy, markets tend to start behaving as though these signs matter.\n\nBehavioural-finance researchers like Terrance Odean, a professor of finance at UC Berkeley and Brad Barber, his longtime co-author, have produced some of the most seminal works on investor psychology. They have shown repeatedly that retail investors become more optimistic and more active in December and January, even when fundamentals look no different from November or any other month. Their studies link this to mood, new-year reset psychology and a widespread belief \u2013 alcohol infused or otherwise - that \u201cthings get better after Christmas\u201d. If that\u2019s not financial astrology or some other esoteric nonsense dressed in business attire, Dollar Bill doesn\u2019t know what is.\n\nThe funny thing is, for all the scoffing at astrology and seasonal behaviour, markets have always been a magnet for people who swear they can decode the future from historical patterns with almost zero reference to underlying fundamentals. Entire careers have been built on drawing lines on charts with the kind of conviction usually reserved for religious scholars. Technical analysts insist the potential for every earnings downgrade, drilling miss, tariff shock or anything else that could impact a spreadsheet are already \u201cpriced in\u201d by efficient markets providing a rationale for the belief that only the squiggles on charts can guide us. It\u2019s a kind of financial hieroglyphics for the initiated.\n\nThe fundamental analysts that tend to congregate in the cigar bar at the Club, of course, dismiss all of this as not much more than witchcraft. These hardcore analysts prefer balance sheets, capex schedules and long-form reports written in fonts so small they require naval-grade optics. But even the most hardened fundamentalists tend to get a little twitchy in December. Again, it comes down to history, numbers and returns.\n\nThese are the same blokes by the way who spend eleven months of the year preaching discounted cashflows, but all of a sudden start muttering about seasonality, window-dressing and low-volume rallies as though reading tea leaves instead of term sheets now matters. And while these technocrats usually get mocked for their lack of focus on psychology and crowd behaviour, Dollar Bill knows they secretly all believe in it \u2013 particularly in December.\n\nTraders look for patterns because patterns make chaos explainable. Algorithms hunt for them because someone told them to. And it\u2019s precisely around Christmas time, when almost everyone - the quant, the boomer, the TikTok disciple - all start behaving like a pattern-seeking market missiles.\n\nAnd curiously, these end-of-year rallies are most prominent when sentiment is at its gloomiest. Research from the American Association of Individual Investors points out that markets grind higher most often when bearish sentiment dominates. A Bank of America global fund-manager survey has produced similar results, showing cash allocations are generally well above long-term averages precisely when indices hit cyclical highs. And now this is repeating again, with global money-market funds swelling beyond US$6 trillion in cash - a record wall of funds demanding allocation in a rally nobody trusts but which keeps reaching higher.\n\nBehavioural economists call this a \u201cdisbelief rally\u201d. It\u2019s the markets climbing what the old hands call a wall of worry. Traders mutter darkly about a pending pullback, a correction, inflation prints, bond yields and central-bank missteps - even recessions - but all the while ploughing more money in.\n\nAll of which leaves us with a slightly embarrassing truth: the more we study markets, the more they resemble a vast behavioural experiment disguised as rational finance.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like the exclusive domain of amateurs and eccentrics, again the history and the data both suggest otherwise. Some of Wall Street\u2019s most decorated traders and analysts have openly flirted with ideas not far removed from what that chap at the club blurted out. W.D. Gann - a doyen of technical analysis and author of Gann Theory whose work is still gospel to modern technicians - actually built an empire using planetary cycles (I kid you not) and seasonal effects as reliable indicators for market trends.\n\nWhich raises the uncomfortable possibility that the line between a seasoned technician and your local clairvoyant is thinner than anyone wants to believe.\n\nIn the end, this may be the real lesson of the silly season. Markets are not driven by Jupiter, Mercury, tarot cards or moonlight. But they are driven by people who sometimes behave as though those things matter \u2013 and they almost always behave as they always have.\n\nSo as the year winds down and the screens glow a little greener, Dollar Bill will raise a glass to the technicians, the fundamentalists and even the would-be astrologers.\n\nTo the Santa rally, long may it live and here\u2019s cheers to all, including the disbelievers.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Credit: AP\n\nJustice Collin Lawrence Sequerah sentenced Najib to 15 years in prison for each charge of abuse of power, and five years for each of the money laundering charges. The sentences are to run concurrently which means the former leader will face another 15 years in prison. The new sentence will run after his current term for an earlier 1MDB case ends, the judge said.\n\nSequerah imposed a total fine of 11.4 billion ringgit for the abuse of power charges. In addition, he also ordered another 2.08 billion ringgit in assets to be recovered from Najib under money laundering laws. If Najib fails to pay, he faces more years in prison.",

Still suggests that the risk of avian influenza infection to the general public remains low, but it is higher for occupationally exposed workers. Okay, these are people who would infect or interact with infected animals. So for the average person, our risk is quite low. But if you have chickens and they are sick, it's important to get those animals tested and know your risks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while we seem to be off the hook for bird flu - at least for now - would we be ready for another pandemic, five years after COVID?\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Paul Kelly, the man who helped lead Australia's COVID-19 public health response, told SBS he's not so sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe worries people may not accept another vaccine program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trust is hard to win and easy to lose. And I think that will be a major issue for us going to the next pandemic. The Australian public was enormously trusting of medical advice and the politicians that were in charge at the national and the state and territory level. I'm not sure that that's the case now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso in January, the Federal Government unveiled Australia\u2019s first-ever National Autism Strategy\u2014a $42 million plan to improve inclusion, access, and outcomes for Australians with autism.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates are calling it a game-changer, offering hope and much-needed support to families across the country who face unique and daily challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking the announcement, Minister for Social Services, Amanda Rishworth said communities from migrant backgrounds were identified as a priority cohort, to address unique barriers they face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether that is through the peer support, whether it is through being very conscious of asking people how they would like to be communicated in different government systems, making sure that we have resources in language is some of the initiatives that we have committed to to make sure there is a priority for linguistically and culturally diverse people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more than 400,000 Australians identified by the Government as living with dementia, not surprisingly there was interest in a new blood test being trialled in the United Kingdom to detect the early signs of dementia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study at the University of Oxford, blood samples are scanned for a series of proteins \u2013 biomarkers, associated with dementia - that can provide early diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kaarin Jane Anstey, from the University of New South Wales, says while medications can assist people in the early stages of dementia, they are not a cure.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has been jailed for a further 15 years after he was found guilty of abusing his power to plunder millions from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund and launder the proceeds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sentence is in addition to the six-year term he is already serving for a separate case related to the now-defunct state investment vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresiding Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah convicted the 72-year-old former leader on all four counts of abuse of power, as well as all 21 counts of money laundering, involving around 2.28 billion ringgit (AU$840 million) from the fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nNajib, dressed in a navy blue suit and white shirt, was seen looking down, slumped in his seat as the judge read the verdict.\n\n\n\n\n\nSentences were handed down of 15 years for each count of power abuse and five years for each money laundering charge, to be served concurrently, after Najib's current jail term ends in 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\nNajib was ordered to pay fines of 11.39 billion ringgit (A$4.2 billion), and the court said 2.08 billion (A$762 million) ringgit in assets must be recovered from him. Failure to deliver on both would result in additional jail time, it said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Ex-Malaysian PM Najib Razak sentenced to 12 years in jail after first trial over 1MDB scandal\n\nNajib's lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said he would appeal the ruling on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement read by his lawyer, Najib urged Malaysians to remain calm and rational and vowed to continue his fight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This struggle is not an effort to avoid responsibility,\" he said. \"It is an endeavour to uphold justice, to uphold the integrity of the constitution, and to defend the sovereignty of the rule of law without fear or favour.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Najib, the son of one of the country's founding fathers, was groomed for leadership from a young age, he experienced a spectacular fall from power as public anger mounted over the corruption scandal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince his 2018 election loss, investigations under successive governments have ensnared him and his wife Rosmah Mansor in graft allegations.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors say Najib abused his positions as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chairman to move vast sums from the fund into his personal accounts more than a decade ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to investigators, proceeds from the fund were used to bankroll high-end real estate, a luxury yacht and precious artworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelivering the verdict on Friday morning, Judge Sequerah dismissed several of the defence lawyers' arguments, including that Najib had been duped by his close associate, the shadowy businessman Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low. Low denies all wrongdoing and his whereabouts are unknown.\n\n\n\nNajib Razak has been in prison since August 2022. Source: AAP Najib has maintained he was misled by Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that funds deposited into his account were donations from the Saudi royal family.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has apologised for allowing the 1MDB scandal to happen during his tenure, but has consistently denied wrongdoing, maintaining he knew nothing about illegal transfers from the fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nNajib could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNajib has been in prison since August 2022, when Malaysia's top court upheld a verdict convicting him of corruption for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis 12-year jail sentence in that case was halved last year by a pardons board.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis legal battle was dealt yet another blow on Monday after he lost a bid to serve the remainder of his current jail term at home rather than the Kajang Prison outside Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n\n",

It could be worthwhile to spend an hour reviewing your super.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) \u2014 the peak body for the superannuation industry \u2014 is encouraging Australians to spend an hour checking their super this holiday season, which could see them thousands of dollars better off in retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Jump online these holidays to check your super is working best for you and that your security settings are up to date,\" ASFA chief executive Mary Delahunty said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes less than an hour and could make a big difference to your retirement.\"\n\n\n\nHow knowledgeable are Australians about their super?\n\nResearch by the Commonwealth Bank in July highlighted widespread gaps in Australians\u2019 understanding of their super.\n\n\n\nIt found 33 per cent of Australians don\u2019t know their super balance, 11 per cent have never checked it, and 31 per cent don't know how their super is invested.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also highlights that women and gen Z are less likely to be aware of how their super is invested.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Finder survey in October revealed that 29 per cent of Australians don't know how their super fund performed over the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nWhat to check on your super account?\n\nASFA recommends Australians start with the basics by ensuring their contact details are up to date, so they don't miss important communications from their fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also suggests reviewing investment and insurance settings, as you could be missing out on potential savings if you're not in the right investment for your age and risk appetite.\n\n\n\nAustralians are also encouraged to check how many super accounts they have through their myGov account and, if they have more than one, consider consolidating into their active fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 30-year-old could add as much as $20,000 to their retirement savings in 20 minutes by consolidating three superannuation accounts, including one with higher fees, into a single low-cost fund, according to Delahunty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's one extra fabulous holiday when you stop working, for less time than it takes to hose the deck for Christmas day,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people may also be able to boost their retirement savings by maximising concessional contributions, with the cap set at $30,000, including employer contributions, this financial year.\n\n\n\nMost Australians happy with their fund's performance\n\nA recent ASFA survey found 79 per cent of super account holders have a positive or very positive level of satisfaction with their fund\u2019s performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey of 1,500 Australians found 90 per cent believe super plays an important role in ensuring financial well-being in retirement, while nearly 80 per cent trust their fund to make sound financial decisions.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How much super will you need?

    "text": "Streaming video is taking up more of our screen time, working from home still commands the most uploads, and Australia is clawing up the worldwide broadband speed rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren may be leaving social media but broadband downloads are rising in Australia, and Queenslanders continue to use more data than users in any other state or territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nNBN Co released details about Australia's online behaviour on Friday, also revealing downloads were expected to dip at the end of 2025 but peak again in January.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings come after a year of change for internet connections in the nation, with thousands more households offered free speed upgrades and fibre to replace copper technology, as well as growing competition from satellite providers such as Starlink.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reforms have encouraged more people to stream entertainment, NBN Co chief technology officer Guy Scott said, with the trend now using 48 per cent of all data downloaded from the National Broadband Network (NBN).\n\n\n\nBy 2035, the company predicts streaming video will account for 59 per cent of all NBN downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren were a major source of streaming demand as downloads were expected to peak during the school holidays, Scott said, even though adults streamed content consistently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When the kids are off school, the network tends to get busier \u2014 in April, July, September and January, they're all busy times for us,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What doesn't change is the busy hour \u2014 the busy hour stays consistently between 9pm and 10pm.\"\n\n\n\nBy contrast, the NBN expected to see a dip in downloads on New Year's Eve, he said, which is when its daily peak demand is lowest.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than three in four Australian households (76 per cent) use streaming video services, according to Worldpanel ComTech, with Paramount+, Stan Sport and ad-supported subscriptions growing in 2025.\n\n\n\nCommunication platforms driving uploads\n\nIn the other direction, broadband uploads continued to be dominated by communications platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom during 2025, NBN Co reported, accounting for 24 per cent of traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\nUploads over the NBN grew by 12 per cent during 2025, while downloads jumped by 10 per cent to reach an average of 508 gigabytes a month \u2014 twice the data downloaded in 2019.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE This is the habit Australians spend 44 hours a week on\n\nQueenslanders downloaded the most data on average for the third year in a row, followed by Western Australia and the ACT, while Tasmanians downloaded the least data.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload speeds also increased across Australia during 2025, fuelled by the NBN's free speed tier upgrades for 2.7 million users in September and free fibre upgrades for eligible premises from January.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 12,000 households were moving to faster and more reliable fibre connections each week, Scott said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We absolutely expect to see traffic continuing to grow,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've built out the fibre network now to 3.5 million premises and we've got another 622,000 premises to build between now and 2030.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia recently ranked 42nd in Ookla Research's global broadband speed tests \u2014 above the United Kingdom for the first time and up from 82nd place in February.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Farah arrived in Australia as a single mother fleeing Iran, she had one certainty - she needed to become financially independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I came to Australia for a better life for my daughter. And because Australia is very safe and very good country for me and daughter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a decade later, the sewing skills she learned in Tehran as a teenager are helping her rebuild a life in Melbourne as a sewing instructor \u2026 and give the city\u2019s iconic tram seats a second chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first time, I was scared. No family, no friends and I couldn\u2019t speak English. For me, very difficult because I don\u2019t know how to find the job. Money, very important for life. If you no money, no life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA social worker introduced Farah to SisterWorks \u2014 where, after completing various English, computer and social skills trainings, she now works alongside 15 other women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All Sisters are here, help together, talk together, and lunch together. SisterWorks is like family for me. Me, I'm happy here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSisterWorks is a Melbourne-based not-for-profit social enterprise that supports refugee, asylum-seeker or migrant women to achieve economic independence.\n\n\n\n\n\nSisterWorks CEO Ifrin Fittock says for most of these women, the job is a first step into Australia\u2019s workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Women really are the big fabric of the CALD community here in Australia. They are untapped workforce. They're willing to put their best efforts and want to go into employment, want to grow themselves and want to participate economically and be like you and I, the taxpayers of this country. It\u2019s almost their dream to be able to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 80 per cent of Melbourne\u2019s tram seats are now reupholstered by women from migrant, refugee and asylum-seeker backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sisters currently refurbish around 70 seats a month, generating more than 1,500 hours of employment and diverting over 1,200 kgs of waste from landfill over the last financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of our Sisters are crafty. They are really meticulous in their work. And that's precisely the skills that are needed to maintain, re upholster and refurbish the Yarra Trams seats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Little bit hard work but for me, I\u2019m happy because I like sewing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYarra Trams Social Procurement Manager, Francesca MacLean, says this partnership is a small shift that speaks to a bigger idea \u2014 how public institutions can drive change beyond their core services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rail industry has, historically, not been incredibly accessible to women, let alone migrant, refugee and asylum seeker women. So, we really love that we can use our social procurement approach to disrupt that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it\u2019s a way of recognising the skills already present in Melbourne\u2019s multicultural communities, and giving them opportunities to thrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The workforce that SisterWorks has is an incredibly untapped talent pool. They've got the entrepreneurial spirit, the women power. It's our way of demonstrating we can use the taxpayer funds to run the tram network, to deliver value above and beyond dollars. It enables them to be role models within their families and communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's also about self-agency, self-belief and confidence that they are an active participant in this country. They just want to do what you and I do - go to work, save some money, buy a house, buy cars and send the kids to school. And the community will thrive because they have this disposable income that they can spend, that\u2019s how the economy grows.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Melbourne, around three million people use trams every single week.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a seat is damaged, it\u2019s removed and assessed, and the ones needing repair are sent to SisterWorks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If your child spilled some food on the seat because were getting a bit hangry mid-journey, or someone's water bottle or coffee has been built, this is what causes the wear and tear. Our people then determine whether the seat is up to scratch for our passengers. And when it's not, it gets sent off to Sister Works. They change the fabric or sometimes they change the foam as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the Sisters take comfortable seating seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The sisters even test if the foam is comfy enough for Yarra Trams passengers. They literally sit on it. I'm not sure if anyone gets a veto, but we have been told by Ifrin that they do sit on it and have a think, \u2018Would I be happy to sit on this seat if I were catching a tram?\u2019, which is great, right? It shows the care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whenever Melbourne is busy with a lot of events New year, Christmas, school holidays \u2026we tend to get more seats coming to us. It's a livelihood of some of the sisters. And I think the sisters are also very happy to be involved in this project. it's like whenever they're in the tram, they can see that this is actually my work, this is something that I fixed and put back into the tram.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Farah, and the many women working beside her, each stitch is a step toward financial stability and a way to take part in the city they now call home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel very happy! All the time thinking \u2018Oh I made that one, I made that one\u2019.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\u201cTo be part of the Asia Cup, everyone wants to do that, but ... I just can\u2019t really put the pressure on myself and see it from that angle,\u201d Freier said. \u201cThe Tillies support my decision, but I think I knew it would always be a risk ... I\u2019m trying to use this whole experience as a positive one. \u201cComing home and playing for the Roar, it\u2019s putting me more in the right direction.\u201d Juggling two lives\n\nAs Freier prepared to return home, her twin sister Laini made a shock decision of her own. Despite earning her maiden Matildas cap, she announced her retirement to focus on other career ambitions and family life. \u201cLaini and I are super close so I know how she felt and was feeling for a while,\u201d Sharn Freier said. Twin sisters Sharn and Laini Freier with their mother. \u201cShe had an unreal first professional football season, accomplished a lot in that short time, but I just knew it wasn\u2019t really what she wanted.\u201d \u201cThe pressure of needing to be not full-time, but at training for as long as we need to be, and working a full-time gig \u2026 she\u2019s happy with what she\u2019s doing now.\u201d\n\nThe average A-League Women\u2019s salary sits around $30,000, and many players essentially juggle two careers \u2013 one that can include disruptions from injury \u2013 to keep up with the cost of living. Loading Freier admits the stress can take a toll. \u201cThe pressure is already there in terms of working, then you go and add an injury or can\u2019t perform in your workplace, and it definitely adds some pressure and takes a toll for most players,\u201d she said. \u201cI think playing in Australia, you really have to love the game. There are a lot of sacrifices.\u201d\n\nHolistic player protection is a paramount focus of the A-League\u2019s new chief medical officer, Dr Sharon Stay. She has sought to ensure every club has access to sideline video surveillance and daily data collection capabilities, to support the juggling act the game\u2019s female athletes endure. \u201cWe want every training session, we want gym-based sessions, we want rest day numbers,\u201d Stay said. \u201cIf someone\u2019s got gastro on a Tuesday, the problem needs to go in our stats. \u201cThese are lives of players we\u2019re managing for 10 to 11 months of the year. There needs to be a little bit more education and key spending on initiatives addressing what the players are exposed to.\u201d\n\nNurturing the next generation Freier\u2019s homecoming has come with a unique experience: being in the elder class of a Roar squad whose average age is 22. Teenage strikers Daisy Brown and Grace Kuilamu have caught Freier\u2019s eye, while Isabela Hoyos (17) and Ruby Cuthbert (18) loom as the future of the club\u2019s defence. With youth comes a challenge in player welfare, with Stay revealing A-League Women\u2019s players experience approximately two to three times more ACL ruptures than men. Stay believes the growing base of teenage prospects has contributed to these figures, with the peak risk of knee ruptures occurring between ages 14 and 17 for women.\n\n\u201cThese girls often tend to be the really sporty girls at school, so they play multiple sports. It\u2019s great for body and physical development and athleticism as a whole, but they are often pulled in many different directions,\u201d she said. Matildas star Mary Fowler was among the several Australian women\u2019s players who ruptured her ACL this year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThese kids may not have had the specialised football development we sometimes see if you took a 20-year-old guy, who would have hundreds and thousands more hours of football-specific development.\u201d In calling for careful management of the demands these players faced, Stay admits it is a battle when seasons and careers are on the line. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect the same of a 15-year-old that you can from a 25-year-old,\u201d she said.",

Credit: Sailing Inukshuk\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t move. It took us probably 45 minutes to clear the thing,\u201d Large said.\n\nAfter finally pulling the net off, Large was concerned his boat may have sustained rudder damage, which would have made it risky to sail the remaining 610 nautical miles.\n\nLarge and Ebbott made the difficult decision to turn back to the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia in Darling Point and retire from the Hobart on the afternoon of Boxing Day.\n\n\u201cI had to put safety ahead of the race,\u201d Large said. \u201cI felt it was more prudent to return rather than continue sailing, where if the rudder failed further down, we could be into some serious problems.\u201d\n\nAn Australian resident for nearly 20 years, Canadian native Large has sailed in six previous Sydney to Hobarts and is experienced with preparing a boat for the race. But no amount of money, spare parts or physical training could have saved Inukshuk from the errant fishing net.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all bad luck,\u201d Large said. \u201cYou prepare for everything, you carry spares which you need to prepare the boat for the seas that you\u2019re going to be getting, we prepare ourselves psychologically and physically to do the race.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of money and a lot of time, six or eight months of work to get a boat ready, to keep checking everything, re-checking it, training.\n\n\u201cThree hours into the race and having to stop for a reason like that is pretty hard to take.\u201d\n\nLarge and Ebbott are hopeful of sailing Inukshuk in a fifth Hobart next year and are planning to contest the trans-Tasman Yacht Race in late February. Before then, Large will fly down to Hobart, reunite with his wife and join in the post-race festivities.\n\n\u201cWe figure we\u2019ve done enough Hobarts we can justify it, we\u2019ve earned a place,\u201d Large said.\n\nInukshuk previously withdrew from the 2021 Hobart after reporting auto-pilot issues.\n\nThe boat\u2019s name is an Inuit word meaning \u201ca structure of rough stones stacked in the form of a human figure\u201d, with such figures traditionally used as a landmark or commemorative sign.\n\nAAP",

Not because Jupiter has anything to do with equities or any other market, but because human behaviour and history do. And ironically, charting human behaviour is also the basis of all technical analysis. Markets run on pattern-seeking and historically December is when those patterns hit overdrive.\n\nTraders see signs in charts where no real fundamental support exists. And then, like a self-fulfilling prophecy, markets tend to start behaving as though these signs matter.\n\nBehavioural-finance researchers like Terrance Odean, a professor of finance at UC Berkeley and Brad Barber, his longtime co-author, have produced some of the most seminal works on investor psychology. They have shown repeatedly that retail investors become more optimistic and more active in December and January, even when fundamentals look no different from November or any other month. Their studies link this to mood, new-year reset psychology and a widespread belief \u2013 alcohol infused or otherwise - that \u201cthings get better after Christmas\u201d. If that\u2019s not financial astrology or some other esoteric nonsense dressed in business attire, Dollar Bill doesn\u2019t know what is.\n\nThe funny thing is, for all the scoffing at astrology and seasonal behaviour, markets have always been a magnet for people who swear they can decode the future from historical patterns with almost zero reference to underlying fundamentals. Entire careers have been built on drawing lines on charts with the kind of conviction usually reserved for religious scholars. Technical analysts insist the potential for every earnings downgrade, drilling miss, tariff shock or anything else that could impact a spreadsheet are already \u201cpriced in\u201d by efficient markets providing a rationale for the belief that only the squiggles on charts can guide us. It\u2019s a kind of financial hieroglyphics for the initiated.\n\nThe fundamental analysts that tend to congregate in the cigar bar at the Club, of course, dismiss all of this as not much more than witchcraft. These hardcore analysts prefer balance sheets, capex schedules and long-form reports written in fonts so small they require naval-grade optics. But even the most hardened fundamentalists tend to get a little twitchy in December. Again, it comes down to history, numbers and returns.\n\nThese are the same blokes by the way who spend eleven months of the year preaching discounted cashflows, but all of a sudden start muttering about seasonality, window-dressing and low-volume rallies as though reading tea leaves instead of term sheets now matters. And while these technocrats usually get mocked for their lack of focus on psychology and crowd behaviour, Dollar Bill knows they secretly all believe in it \u2013 particularly in December.\n\nTraders look for patterns because patterns make chaos explainable. Algorithms hunt for them because someone told them to. And it\u2019s precisely around Christmas time, when almost everyone - the quant, the boomer, the TikTok disciple - all start behaving like a pattern-seeking market missiles.\n\nAnd curiously, these end-of-year rallies are most prominent when sentiment is at its gloomiest. Research from the American Association of Individual Investors points out that markets grind higher most often when bearish sentiment dominates. A Bank of America global fund-manager survey has produced similar results, showing cash allocations are generally well above long-term averages precisely when indices hit cyclical highs. And now this is repeating again, with global money-market funds swelling beyond US$6 trillion in cash - a record wall of funds demanding allocation in a rally nobody trusts but which keeps reaching higher.\n\nBehavioural economists call this a \u201cdisbelief rally\u201d. It\u2019s the markets climbing what the old hands call a wall of worry. Traders mutter darkly about a pending pullback, a correction, inflation prints, bond yields and central-bank missteps - even recessions - but all the while ploughing more money in.\n\nAll of which leaves us with a slightly embarrassing truth: the more we study markets, the more they resemble a vast behavioural experiment disguised as rational finance.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like the exclusive domain of amateurs and eccentrics, again the history and the data both suggest otherwise. Some of Wall Street\u2019s most decorated traders and analysts have openly flirted with ideas not far removed from what that chap at the club blurted out. W.D. Gann - a doyen of technical analysis and author of Gann Theory whose work is still gospel to modern technicians - actually built an empire using planetary cycles (I kid you not) and seasonal effects as reliable indicators for market trends.\n\nWhich raises the uncomfortable possibility that the line between a seasoned technician and your local clairvoyant is thinner than anyone wants to believe.\n\nIn the end, this may be the real lesson of the silly season. Markets are not driven by Jupiter, Mercury, tarot cards or moonlight. But they are driven by people who sometimes behave as though those things matter \u2013 and they almost always behave as they always have.\n\nSo as the year winds down and the screens glow a little greener, Dollar Bill will raise a glass to the technicians, the fundamentalists and even the would-be astrologers.\n\nTo the Santa rally, long may it live and here\u2019s cheers to all, including the disbelievers.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

    "text": "Putrajaya, Malaysia: Imprisoned former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was sentenced to 15 years in jail and penalised 13.5 billion ringgit ($5 billion) in fines and assets after being convicted in his biggest corruption trial tied to the multibillion-dollar looting of the 1MDB state investment fund.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s High Court found Najib, 72, guilty on four counts of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering related to more than $US700 million ($1 billion) channelled into his personal bank accounts from the 1MDB fund.\n\nFormer Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak (centre, facing camera) in October. Credit: AP\n\nJustice Collin Lawrence Sequerah sentenced Najib to 15 years in prison for each charge of abuse of power, and five years for each of the money laundering charges. The sentences are to run concurrently which means the former leader will face another 15 years in prison. The new sentence will run after his current term for an earlier 1MDB case ends, the judge said.\n\nSequerah imposed a total fine of 11.4 billion ringgit for the abuse of power charges. In addition, he also ordered another 2.08 billion ringgit in assets to be recovered from Najib under money laundering laws. If Najib fails to pay, he faces more years in prison.",
