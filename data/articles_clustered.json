    "text": "World leaders and Catholic faithful have bidden farewell to Pope Francis in a funeral highlighting his concern for the \"most peripheral of the peripheries\" and reflecting his wishes as pastor.\n\nThough presidents and princes attended the mass in St Peter's Square today, prisoners and migrants welcomed him at the basilica across town where he will be buried.\n\nSome 250,000 people flocked to the funeral, held on a brilliant spring day that was supposed to have been a special Holy Year celebration for adolescents.\n\nAS IT HAPPENED: World leaders join huge crowds to farewell Pope Francis \ufeff\n\nArchbishop Diego Giovanni Ravelli (front, left) kneels next to the closed coffin at the funeral mass for the late Pope Francis in St Peter's Square. (dpa/picture alliance via Getty I)\n\nPerhaps because so many young people were on hand, the somber ceremony still had a festive mood, with mourners taking selfies amid the hymns as Francis' simple wooden coffin was brought out of St Peter's Basilica at the start of the Mass.\n\nCardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, delivered a lengthy, spirited and highly personal homily, or sermon. He eulogised Francis as a pope of the people, a pastor who knew how to communicate to the \"least among us\" with an informal, spontaneous style.\n\n\"He was a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone,\" Re said.\n\nHe drew applause from the crowd when he recounted Francis' constant concern for migrants, including when he celebrated Mass at the US-Mexico border and travelled to a refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece, and brought 12 migrants home with him.\n\n\"The guiding thread of his mission was also the conviction that the church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open,\" Re said.\n\nThe Argentine pontiff choreographed the funeral himself when he revised and simplified the Vatican's rites and rituals last year. His aim was to emphasise the pope's role as a mere pastor and not \"a powerful man of this world\".\n\nFuneral of Pope Francis: World leaders and royals pay their respects View Gallery\n\nIt was a reflection of Francis' 12-year project to radically reform the papacy, to stress priests as servants and to construct \"a poor church for the poor\".\n\nHe articulated the mission just days after his 2013 election and it explained the name he chose as pope, honouring St Francis of Assisi \"who had the heart of the poor of the world\", according to the official decree of the pope's life that was placed in his coffin before it was sealed on Friday night.\n\nDespite Francis' focus on the powerless, the powerful were out in force at his funeral. US President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined Prince William and European royals leading more than 160 official delegations.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei had the pride of place given Francis' nationality, even if the two didn't particularly get along and the pope alienated many Argentines by never returning home.\n\nTrump and Zelenskyy met privately on the sidelines of the funeral.

(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office)\n\nAfter the Mass, Francis' coffin left the Vatican en route to his burial place in St Mary Major Basilica.\n\nThe white facade of St Peter's glowed pink as the sun rose and hordes of mourners rushed into the square. Giant television screens were set up along the surrounding streets for those who couldn't get close.\n\nThe Mass and funeral procession across town \u2014 with Francis' coffin carried on the open-topped popemobile he used during his 2015 trip to the Philippines \u2014 were also broadcast live around the world.\n\nPolice helicopters whirled overhead, part of the massive security operation Italian authorities mounted, including more than 2500 police, 1500 soldiers and a torpedo ship off the coast, Italian media reported.\n\nThe coffin is displayed during the funeral of Pope Francis. (Getty)\n\nMany mourners had planned to be in Rome anyway this weekend for the now-postponed Holy Year canonisation of the first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, and groups of scouts and youth church groups nearly outnumbered the gaggles of nuns and seminarians.\n\n\"He was a very charismatic pope, very human, very kind, above all very human,\" said Miguel Vaca, a pilgrim from Peru who said he had camped out near the piazza.\n\n\"It is a very great emotion to say goodbye to him.\"\n\nThe poor and marginalised welcome him\n\nFrancis, the first Latin American and first Jesuit pope, died on Easter Monday at age 88 after suffering a stroke while recovering at home from pneumonia.\n\nFollowing his funeral, preparations can begin in earnest to launch the centuries-old process of electing a new pope, a conclave that will likely begin in the first week of May.\n\nIn the interim, the Vatican is being run by a handful of cardinals, key among them Re, who is organising the secret voting in the Sistine Chapel.\n\nPrince William arrives at the funeral of Pope Francis in St Peter's Square. (Getty)\n\nFrancis is breaking with recent tradition and will be buried in St Mary Major, near Rome's main train station, where a simple tomb awaits him with just his name: Franciscus.\n\nAs many as 300,000 people are expected to line the Six-kilometre motorcade route that will bring Francis' coffin from the Vatican through the centre of Rome to the basilica after the funeral.\n\nForty special guests, organised by the Vatican's Caritas charity and the Sant'Egidio community, will greet his coffin at the basilica, honouring the marginalised groups Francis prioritised as pope: homeless people and migrants, prisoners and transgender people.\n\n\"The poor have a privileged place in the heart of God,\" the Vatican quoted Francis as saying in explaining the choice.\n\nClergy during the funeral of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. (AP)\n\nA special relationship with the basilica\n\nEven before he became pope, Francis had a particular affection for St Mary Major, home to a Byzantine-style icon of the Madonna, the Salus Populi Romani, to which Francis was particularly devoted.\n\nHe would pray before it before and after each of his foreign trips as pope.\n\nThe choice of the basilica is also symbolically significant given its ties to Francis' Jesuit religious order.\n\nSt Ignatius Loyola, who founded the Jesuits, celebrated his first Mass in the basilica on Christmas Day in 1538.\n\nCandles illuminate a picture of the late Pope Francis outside the Cathedral in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Saturday, April 26, 2025, as his funeral takes place in Rome. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) (AP)\n\nCrowds waited hours to bid farewell to Francis\n\nOver three days this week, more than 250,000 people stood for hours in line to pay their final respects while Francis' body lay in state in St Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe Vatican kept the basilica open through the night to accommodate them, but it wasn't enough. When the doors closed to the general public at 7pm yesterday (3am today AEST), mourners were turned away in droves.\n\nBy dawn Saturday, they were back and ready to say a final farewell, some recalling the words he uttered the very first night of his election and throughout his papacy.\n\n\"We are here to honour him because he always said 'don't forget to pray for me,'\" said Sister Christiana Neenwata from Biafrana, Nigeria.\n\n\"So we are also here to give to him this love that he gave to us.\"",

    "text": "The mother of a NSW woman who died of cervical cancer has told how her daughter spent more than a year trying to get doctors to listen to her concerns.\n\nAmanda Ne'Roi is speaking out about her daughter Jaime's devastating case as three peak research organisations - the Australian New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group, Ovarian Cancer Australia and the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation - join forces to call on the government to commit $100 million in funding towards gynaecological cancer.\n\nAround 19 Australian women a day are diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer, according to December 2024 statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW).\n\nJaime Ne'Roi, pictured with her daughter Indiana. Jaime died in 2023 when Indiana was aged one. (Supplied)\n\nHowever, survival rates for gynaecological cancers have stagnated and fallen well behind improvements for other cancers, such as breast cancer.\n\nIn the 15 years between 1991\u20131995 and 2016\u20132020, the five-year survival rate for women with gynaecological cancers increased by just 6 per cent, compared with 13 per cent for breast cancer, the AIHW data shows.\n\nNe'Roi said Jaime knew something was not right a few months after she gave birth to her second child, Indiana, in May 2020.\n\n\"She was having spotting, discharge, and an upset stomach. She felt sick. She just knew something was wrong,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nJaime went to her GP, who referred her to a gynaecologist she had seen a decade earlier, when abnormal cells were detected on her cervix.\n\nAt the time, the gynaecologist decided against a hysterectomy because she was yet to have children.\n\nNe'Roi said the gynecologist dismissed her daughter's symptoms because she had recently given birth.\n\n\"He said it was just because she had a baby. He didn't even give her a pap smear test,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nIt took her daughter Jaime more than a year for doctors to listen to her concerns, her mother Amanda Ne'Roi said. (Supplied)\n\nJaime then went to another gynaecologist, who also attributed the symptoms to her having had a baby and put her on the contraceptive pill, Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"She kept saying to them, there's something very wrong.\"\n\nNe'Roi said she remembered having conversations with Jaime, who was very worried, and telling her to go back to the gynaecologist.\n\nAfter another visit, the gynaecologist agreed to do an internal examination via a laparoscopy in August 2021, which revealed Jaime had stage 3 cervical cancer at the age of 37.\n\n\"By the time she actually got a doctor to listen, she had a seven-centimetre tumour and it was inoperable,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nJaime underwent radiation and chemotherapy, and briefly received good news in December 2021, when a scan showed up clear.\n\nHowever, by February 2022 the cancer was back and had spread to her uterus and lymph nodes.\n\nA hysterectomy and more chemotherapy and radiation followed, but Jaime's health was deteriorating fast.\n\nThe last option presented by Jaime's doctors was immunotherapy, however, the family was told it would need to foot the bill at a cost of $6000 a fortnight.\n\n\"My husband and I were looking at selling up our property, everything - so were her brothers,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nWith the money needed immediately, however, the family started an online fundraiser, which allowed Jaime to start the treatment.\n\nThe treatment was not unsuccessful and Jaime died in July 2023, just under two years after she was first diagnosed.\n\nShe left behind her partner and two children, Harrison, then aged six, and Indiana, aged one.\n\n\"The hardest thing I've had to do in my whole entire life was to tell my grandson his mum had gone,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"He burst into tears and said, 'I just want my mommy back.'\"\n\nJaime Ne'Roi died two years after she was diagnosed with stage three cervical cancer. (Supplied)\n\nRates of cervical cancer have been increasing in Australia, despite the national rollout of the HPV vaccine in 2007, which provides some protection against the cancer-causing virus.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2024, incidence rates of cervical cancer have climbed from 5.5 cases per 100,000 people to 8, AIHW data shows.\n\nNe'Roi said Jaime had been vaccinated for HPV, which showed why women should not become complacent about the disease.\n\n\"I think the trouble is, people become very complacent about gynecological cancers, they aren't mentioned much. Breast cancer is huge,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"I'm sharing this story to illustrate the hidden crisis impacting all Australian women, because it can hit any one of us at any time.\"\n\nMore money was desperately needed for research for all gynecological cancers, Ne'Roi said.\n\nProfessor Clare Scott, Australia New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group (ANZGOG) chair, said gynecological cancers had been left underfunded for decades and were a hidden crisis that was expected to grow.\n\nGynecological cancers - which include uterine, ovarian and cervical cancers - are predicted to surge by 21 per cent over the next 10 years.\n\n\"For too long, gynaecological cancers have been overlooked and underfunded, leaving women with limited treatment options and unacceptable survival rates,\" Scott said.\n\n\"These are not just statistics - they are our mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, and friends... we must do better.\"\n\nANZGOG, along with Ovarian Cancer Australia and the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation, are seeking $100 million in federal government funding over four years to go towards more personalised treatments for patients, clinical education, a national research databank and drug trials.\n\n\"The survival rates for gynaecological cancers have barely changed in decades. That fact alone should be a wake-up call,\" Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation CEO Robin Penty said.\n\n\"We know that the answers are there \u2013 they lie in research and in better understanding of women's bodies and women's pain. To reveal them we need appropriate and proportionate investment.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Health Minister Mark Butler said he would continue discussions with the ANZGOG about their proposal.\n\n\"The Albanese Labor government is doing all we can to support patients, families, loved ones and carers on the cancer journey,\" the spokesperson said.",

The Coalition's promise to end electric vehicle subsidies could drive up prices for popular EVs by more than $15,000 under a typical novated lease and have an almost immediate effect on sales.\n\nThe issue has been sitting on the Albanese government's desk since the High Court decided that only the federal government could impose such a charge, vetoing a charge imposed by the Victorian government.\n\nWhile fuel excise revenue is not quarantined to be spent on road maintenance, it is often framed in that way, and the shifting towards EVs risks eroding a lucrative source of federal revenue, hauling in $23 billion last financial year.\n\n\"What the Labor Party is expecting is low- and middle-income earners in [outer urban] seats like McEwen, seats like Hawke, in Bendigo \u2026 they're effectively subsidising wealthier individuals in Kooyong, in Brighton and other areas who can afford to pay for an EV. We don't think that's fair,\" Senator McKenzie said.\n\nBut asked how EV drivers would be made to pay, such as a road use charge, she did not offer an answer, saying only that the Coalition was \"not proposing any new taxes\".\n\nThe admission comes in the same week as Peter Dutton backflipped on repealing Labor's fringe benefits tax concession for EVs purchased through novated lease, which he had earlier said he would leave untouched but now says is \"wasteful\".\n\n\"We didn't agree with the fringe benefit tax exemption, we've been really clear on that,\" Senator McKenzie said.\n\nThe Coalition will also water down the National Vehicle Efficiency Standard introduced by Labor.\n\nDon't touch backpacker visas, Nationals say\n\nSenator McKenzie, who represents junior Coalition partner the Nationals, said a Dutton government would not cut the number of working holiday-makers granted visas.\n\nThat exemption is not something that Mr Dutton or fellow Liberals have announced as their policy, and would make it harder to achieve the unspecified cuts to net migration the opposition says it intends.\n\nWhile the Coalition's calls to reduce net (temporary) migration have focused mainly on international students, the number of backpackers in the country on working holiday visas has surged since the pandemic thanks to a rule that allows British and Irish travellers to stay for three years rather than two.\n\nMigration falling despite election debate over 'surge' Photo shows Generic photos of apartments, balconies The migration \"surge\" is a major election issue, but official figures say numbers are already falling, with a big hit due in a couple of years.\n\nThe work of backpackers on farms, which is often a requirement of their stay, is regarded as essential by many regional employers, which is why the Nationals are highly protective of the migration stream.\n\n\"We need those backpackers out in our regions [for] tourism, hospitality and agriculture \u2026 We're not cutting that,\" Senator McKenzie said.\n\n\"International students \u2014 absolutely cutting that number.\"\n\nMr Dutton has also pledged to cut permanent migration by 25 per cent, but has not said how many family visas or skilled visas he will cut, detailing only a fraction of his pledge to be achieved by trimming refugee visas.\n\nDetails of the Coalition's migration policies are among many remaining loose ends less than one week from election day.\n\nSome of those details may be resolved when costings are released later this week, such as how the party will pay for its extra $21 billion in defence spending, and how it will cut the jobs of 41,000 Canberra-based public servants in non-frontline and non-security roles when official figures suggest there are not that many in the first place.\n\nLabor also faces questions about how it will pay for election commitments it has made in recent weeks, including its new housing supply subsidies and today's announcement of an expanded national medical hotline.\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallagher told Sky News on Sunday that all new spending would be offset with savings or by re-prioritising other spending.",

(Supplied: Lisa Rickert/Newman History 6753)\n\nMs Rickert bought and restored one of the first homes built in the remote mining town, to celebrate the formative years of WA's mining industry.\n\nShe has set up the home exactly as it would have looked in the late 60s by sourcing original furniture and other common items from her childhood.\n\nBut she hasn't had to do it alone, with past and present Newman residents donating old belongings for the project.\n\n\"I've even had people bring things back from out of town,\" Ms Rickert said.\n\n\"Other people have posted things up [online] when they've found them.\n\n\"They think, 'Oh, will I throw this out? Or will I donate it to the history project?'\"\n\nIn 2022, Ms Rickert bought a worker's cottage built in 1968 and has recreated its original interior design.

(Supplied: Lisa Rickert/Newman History 6753)\n\n\"I think it was an exciting time [in the 60s] for those young people and they looked upon it as a challenge.\n\n\"Being so isolated back then and so far away from family, which we are today \u2026 the people, the friends that you make in town, they sort of become your family.\n\n\"The bond between Newman people is so strong they actually have an annual reunion every year in March.\"\n\nSome of Ms Rickert's items poke fun at Newman's isolation and reputation for being a tough place to live. (ABC Pilbara: Charlie Mclean)\n\nBut she recognises not everyone is up for the \"challenge\".\n\n\"There's the other side,\" Ms Rickert said.\n\n\"When Dad first came to town in March of 1970 the average stay was two weeks.\n\n\"So a lot of the men that came here took one look around and just said 'No, I'm not bringing my family here' and jumped on the next flight home.\"",

    "text": "Ten years ago, author Rochelle Siemienowicz threw a \"bomb\" into her relationship.\n\nShe was married to David, the father of her child, and loved him dearly.\n\nBut for her, their partnership wasn't \"enough\".\n\n\"I'd had a few affairs that all came out because I decided I wanted to be radically honest,\" Rochelle tells ABC TV's Compass.\n\nIt's a period she now refers to, half-jokingly, as \"the crisis\".\n\n\"I was wracked with guilt and shame\u2026 but the thing that sustained me through that period was the knowledge that I was going to live in truth \u2026 instead of trying to lead some kind of double life where I had the security and harmony of a partnership, while also having the odd fling outside of that.\"\n\nRochelle had fallen for another man, but she didn't want to break up her marriage.\n\nWas there a way she could continue loving both?\n\nMore than sex\n\nIn recent years, polyamory and open relationships have well and truly entered the cultural Zeitgeist.\n\nWe've seen the ups and downs of these romantic configurations discussed on TV shows like Couples Therapy and in Esther Perel's hit podcast Where Should We Begin?\n\nBut away from therapist couches, polyamory is viewed by many as an experimental phase.\n\nPolyamory and, more broadly, ethical non-monogamy (ENM) is becoming increasingly common among younger generations. ENM is a preference you can set on certain dating apps.\n\nDefinitions: Polyamory: Having consensual romantic or sexual relationships with two or more people at the same time. Ethical non-monogamy or ENM: An umbrella term for any relationship style or structure that includes more than two people, romantically or sexually. All individuals must be informed and consenting. Throuple: A romantic or sexual relationship between three people. Polycule: A group of people who are all connected through polyamorous relationships.\n\nBut this phenomenon isn't new or limited to those under 30.\n\nAnd despite assumptions, polyamory or ENM are about far more than sex.\n\nIt's about consciously designing a way of living and loving that questions societal norms around loyalty and marriage.\n\n\"I think a lot of good relationships end because someone wants to have more sex or romance, or they've met somebody else that they'd like to get to know,\" says Rochelle.\n\n\"And maybe there are other ways of evolving and transitioning a relationship, [rather] than just divorcing and starting the whole thing again with somebody new.\"\n\nRochelle recalls feeling \"guilt and shame\" when she told her husband David (left) she was also in love with another man. (Compass: Daniel Gallagher)\n\nIn Rochelle's case, \"the crisis\" put a huge strain on her marriage.\n\nIn the end, her husband David realised he was comfortable with staying married, and knowing that his wife was entering a relationship with another man.\n\n\"It was tough,\" recalls Rochelle.\n\n\"But I also know that [David] looks at that time now as the best thing that could have happened for our relationship.\n\n\" It was a generative conflict that allowed for us to grow something new in the ruins \u2026 a trust that was built around honesty. \"\n\nConfronting jealousy and fear\n\nRochelle's \"nesting partner\" David and her other partner Markus get along well.\n\nWithin a few weeks of \"the crisis\" they'd met and liked each other immediately.\n\nBut this new dynamic still cast drama into the relationship.\n\n\"All three of us would hang out together socially \u2026 we'd go to the movies, we'd have dinner, we'd go out for cocktails,\" says Rochelle.\n\n\"Sometimes it would go really well, and sometimes it would be awkward and suddenly a lot of feelings would come up.\n\n\"Anyone who tries non-monogamy for the first time might be surprised by how much drama and emotional turmoil it can involve.\"\n\nRochelle and her partners Markus and David enjoy hanging out as a trio. (Compass: Daniel Gallagher)\n\nSelina Nguyen, a Sydney-based sex and relationship therapist, says non-monogamy is definitely not for the light-hearted.\n\n\"There is a lot of self-reflection, self-growth and self-awareness that goes into it, if you're doing it well, with good intentions,\" she explains.\n\nWithin these relationships, insecurities, fears and feelings of jealousy will invariably arise.\n\n\"It's often a very common story for people \u2026 to start to question how important they are to their partner if their partner starts dating or having sex with other people,\" she says.\n\nOpening up doesn't change your worth, she says, but it could change how your partner spends their time.\n\nYet, in a society where monogamy is the norm, it can be difficult to separate sexual or romantic exclusivity from relationship security.\n\nDespite this, Ms Nguyen believes there's value in wrestling with \u2014 rather than avoiding \u2014 our deepest relationship concerns.\n\nTherapist Selina Nguyen says it can be confronting when couples start questioning monogamy. (Compass: Sissy Reyes)\n\n\"We can place so many rules on our sexual relationships or romantic relationships for the sake of trying to protect ourselves, but also to avoid the sticky feelings of jealousy or insecurity,\" she says.\n\n\"But the reality is they're not necessarily emotions to run away from, they're just emotions.\"\n\nShe views jealousy as somewhat of a canary in a coal mine. It can indicate that you're needing more in your relationship \u2014 monogamous or otherwise.\n\n\"It's a time for you to slow down, check in, see what's going on for you and maybe what you're wanting more of in your life, in your relationship, and [then] ideally communicating that to your partner,\" she says.\n\n\"You know, 'Do I need a phone call or a date night at the end of the week to just remind ourselves that we're good and we love each other?'\"\n\nMonogamy: Blessing or burden?\n\nFor some Australians, the notion of polyamory challenges deeply held moral beliefs.\n\nIn many faiths and cultures, sex is viewed as something that should only take place within a marriage.\n\nFor Justine Toh, senior fellow at the Centre for Public Christianity, monogamy also carries significant societal benefit.\n\n\"I think monogamy is really important to lifelong relationships because it creates a protective factor \u2026 where you can be at your worst, as well as your best, and know that there is a safe, secure relationship [and] that you don't have to prove yourself constantly,\" she says.\n\nJustine Toh believes there's beauty in knowing your partner will stick by you through good times and bad. (Compass: Kim Akhurst)\n\n\"It's a good that that spills over into the wider community as well, because \u2026 you don't have to worry necessarily about your spouse looking at someone else and going, 'I want to be in a relationship with them'.\"\n\nYet, Dr Toh understands that in our modern age \u2014 with longer life spans and more opportunities to meet people \u2014 lifelong monogamy can feel like a \"burden\" for some.\n\n\"The fact that polyamory is on the table for people, I think, shows the waning effect perhaps of Christian ideas in our world,\" she says. \"Some people will be absolutely happy about that.\"\n\nBut she acknowledges that aspects of ethical non-monogamy \u2014 namely the focus on honesty, intentionality and open communication \u2014 could have merit in all kinds of relationships.\n\n\"I wonder whether \u2026 this is something that the non-polyamorous community can learn from the polyamorous tribe?\" she posits.\n\n\"That they should be more intentional and open and communicative about their needs, wants and desires.\n\n\"I just don't think we need to, I guess, liberalise the marital relationship in order to achieve that. We could work on better communication as is, and that's going to be good for everyone.\"\n\nAn unexpected romance\n\nMelbourne-based dancer and choreographer Joel is all too familiar with the emotional work that goes into polyamorous arrangements.\n\nSeveral years ago, at a Mardi Gras party in Sydney, he met couple Nic and Chris.\n\n\"We danced a little bit, and then three minutes in \u2014 I've never done this before or since \u2014 I basically just said, 'Do you want to come back to mine at the end of this party?'\" Joel recalls.\n\n\"They kind of looked at each other and were like, 'Yeah, OK.' It was the simplest, easiest pick-up ever.\"\n\nNic, Chris and Joel met on the dance floor at a queer party during Mardi Gras. (Compass: Daniel Gallagher)\n\nBefore meeting Joel, Nic and Chris had been living together in a non-monogamous relationship.\n\nBut none of them expected that a fun night would morph into something far greater: a throuple.\n\n\"It was a romance,\" says Joel. \"With all the things that you expect.\"\n\n\" I remember the moment they bought a king-size bed, I was like, 'That's a major furniture purchase. That's a real commitment to this relationship.' I felt very touched. \"\n\nAfter about a year, the trio realised that they weren't all on the same page.\n\nChris and Joel had fallen for one another, while Nic and Joel realised they were incompatible.\n\n\"Getting into a throuple really challenged a lot of my attachment issues,\" recalls Nic, a writer and advocate.\n\nIntellectually, Nic knew Chris wasn't going to leave him for Joel, there was no real risk.\n\nYet, his body begged to differ. He began feeling physical manifestations of threat: rising temperature, sick in the stomach.\n\n\"It was just like, 'This is a bad thing.'\"\n\nJoel (right) describes Chris as \"the best person on the planet\". (Compass: Daniel Gallagher)\n\nJoel was also acutely aware of this change.\n\n\"I still have enormous affection for Nic \u2026 that's never wavered, but the romantic sexual thing kind of waned,\" he says.\n\n\"I didn't know how to parlay that into a friendship when I was also falling in love with his life partner [Chris].\n\n\"I thought I had to break-up with both of them.\"\n\nConsciously unthroupling\n\nChris was floored by the break-up.\n\n\"I [was] this hopeless, romantic, optimistic in the middle,\" recalls the Melbourne-based psychologist.\n\n\"I was hoping that Nic would just fall for Joel like I did \u2026 and it would all be okay. I was maybe in denial.\"\n\nGrieving the relationship, Joel confided in friends who had experience in polyamory. They told him there might be another option: could he break up with Nic, but stay together with Chris?\n\nThe trio talked things through. It became clear that Chris and Joel wanted to get back together, even though this was a pain point for Nic.\n\n\"[I told them,] 'I'm not exactly over the moon about it, but I also don't want to stand in your way,'\" Nic recalls.\n\nDeep down, he knew that if he put his foot down \u2014 barred the relationship \u2014 a seed of resentment could begin to grow in his own partnership with Chris.\n\n\"I knew that would essentially have a poisoning effect on [my] relationship,\" Nic says.\n\n\"And I knew it wasn't an actual threat to [my] relationship, just to my ego \u2026 or the soul.\"\n\nNic says polyamory helped him to process and accept his insecurities. ((Supplied))\n\nFor Chris, his reunion with Joel was bittersweet.\n\n\"I was doing something that was making Nic hurt and putting him in this pain,\" says Chris.\n\n\"What saved us, I guess, was this belief [Nic and I] always had in our relationship that we wanted to be together forever.\n\n\"Even in the worst fights and the worst conflict, we always said at the core of this was this idea that we knew we would be stronger if we could get through this.\"\n\nDespite the turmoil Nic experienced, he's now grateful for the throupling and unthroupling of it all.\n\n\"I have to be careful, because I'll be like, 'Yes, it was very hard on me \u2026 people should be in awe of my strength,'\" Nic laughs.\n\n\"But on the flip side of that, the experience of going through poly and opening up the relationship beyond consensual non-monogamy to a space where can fall in love with others \u2026 it's been such a gift.\n\n\"That really difficult process has actually improved my friendships, and my relationships with family members.\n\n\"Since that time I've also fallen in love with other people and had them join the 'polycule' so to speak.\"\n\n'The most extraordinary gift'\n\nChris, Nic and Joel have managed to talk and work through all of the complicated, messy and uncomfortable feelings that can arise in a polyamorous arrangement, like theirs.\n\nThey now pride themselves as being Naarm's \"most successful polycule\" and hope, one day, to live together in the country.\n\n\"Three old queens in a cottage,\" Joel quips.\n\nFor Joel, polyamory has never felt like a precarious way to love.\n\n\"I think a lot of people would be surprised to know that you can get that sense of safety and sense of belonging from a polyamorous relationship,\" he says.\n\n\"For me, [it's] this authentic way that we're supposed to be living, which is in broader extended family groups. I think of Nic, Chris and I as a queer family.\"\n\nChris (middle) says his relationships with Joel and Nic are different, but \"equal in terms of the love\". (Compass: Daniel Gallagher)\n\nWearing his psychologist hat, Chris points out that questioning traditional norms can be incredibly liberating.\n\n\"When you start questioning monogamy, these relationship structures, this way you thought you had to live \u2026 you then really start questioning everything,\" he says.\n\n\"You really get left with this complete freedom of not only, 'What do I want my relationship to look like?' but 'What do I want my life to look like?'\"\n\nChris \u2014 who recently married Nic and is still happily in a relationship with Joel \u2014 believes love is limitless.\n\nAnd for his life partner, and now husband, Nic, the ups and downs of polyamory have ultimately been worth it.\n\n\"Along this whole journey, [my] loyalty to that shared adventure through life [with Chris] has never wavered, even as we've redefined things,\" he says.\n\n\"I am so loyal to that shared life with him, and that now extends to a shared life with this wonderful person [Joel], who's a dear friend and a non-romantic, but deep lover as well.\n\n\"It's the most extraordinary gift.\"\n\nWatch Beyond Monogamy on Compass on tonight at 6:30pm on ABC TV, or stream now on iview.",

    "text": "In just three decades, the Greens have transformed from what was essentially an environmental protest movement to Australia's third largest party by vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the 2022 election, the federal Australian Greens secured 12.2 per cent of the primary vote \u2014 an almost 2 per cent increase from the party's primary vote in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens are looking to achieve even greater success on 3 May , capitalising on the bloc of generally more progressive Gen Z and millennial voters, who outnumber baby boomers for the first time this election.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs thousands flock to pre-polling centres, Greens leader Adam Bandt says the party is feeling confident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're getting a terrific response on the doors, the streets and the polling booths to our plan to get dental and mental health into Medicare, finally tackle the housing and rental crisis, make child care free, and stop opening up new coal and gas mines in the middle of a climate crisis,\" the member for Melbourne says.\n\n\n\nWhat are the Greens' main policies?\n\nProfessor Rodney Smith from the University of Sydney says the Greens have been able to position themselves quite successfully as an alternative for disenchanted Labor voters who are looking for a more solid, leftist, or progressive policy package.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey promises from the Greens include:\n\n\n\nCancelling all student HECS debt;\n\nExpanding Medicare to cover dental;\n\nBanning new coal and gas projects; and\n\nIntroducing higher taxes on billionaires and big corporations.\n\nGreens leader Adam Bandt outside Melbourne's Luna Park earlier this month. The Greens have long campaigned for dental treatment to be covered by Medicare. Source: AAP / Nadir Kinani On the campaign trail, the party has also pledged to make HIV prevention medications PrEP and PEP free \u2014 a policy announced on the adult social media site OnlyFans , in a headline-grabbing move by Brisbane MP Stephen Bates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've also unveiled a national plan to provide free school meals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather, the party's housing and homelessness spokesperson, says housing is the \"defining issue\" of the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party has put forward its own measures to tackle the housing crisis, including discounted mortgage rates and capping rents.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also scrap negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount for investors with more than one property.\n\n\n\n(From left) Ryan MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown, Greens leader Adam Bandt, Griffith MP Max Chandler-Mather and Brisbane MP Stephen Bates. Source: SBS News \"There's certainly a lot of people voting Greens for the first time in their lives because we're the only party with policies to make housing affordable,\" Mather says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany voters have also voiced frustration with the major parties' handling of international issues, particularly the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens have taken a firm stance, pledging to continue calling for an end to the occupation of Palestinian territories and urging Israel to halt what they describe as an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a description backed by several prominent international organisations but repeatedly denied by Israel .\n\n\n\nHow powerful are the Greens?\n\nJill Sheppard, a professor of Australian Politics at the Australian National University, says the Greens' popularity in the Senate is particularly important.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Greens can't form government on their own, their policies are more an indication of how party members may vote on legislation, she says, and the number of seats they secure will determine how much power they'll wield over legislation in the upper house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although we focus on the House of Representatives, particularly around an election because that's where government is won and lost, the Senate is still really important for passing legislation after the election,\" Sheppard says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There, the Greens have held the balance of power for quite a while. They are very experienced Senate negotiators, and so even if they are sidelined in some kind of independent-Labor minority government, they will still be strong in the upper house.\"\n\n\n\nPolls suggest the Greens are likely to retain the five Senate seats they are contesting in this election, meaning it's likely the party will retain its powerful 11-seat upper house voting bloc.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has insisted he won't do a deal with the Greens to form government if Labor fails to win a majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has frequently raised the prospect of a Labor-Greens alliance as a point of concern for voters, pointing out that the Greens and Labor usually recommend that voters put the other party in the second position on how-to-vote cards.\n\n\n\n\n\nSheppard says that, if Labor falls short of the 76 seats it needs for a majority, it will likely first look to independents to form government.\n\n\n\n\"They probably feel like they can work with [Independents] more easily ... without offering the Greens a spot in cabinet, which would be about the worst-case scenario for the ALP,\" Sheppard says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The major parties want you to think that a hung parliament is bad because they desperately want majority government for themselves. But a hung parliament isn't bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We saw between 2010 and 2013 a minority government last the full term quite successfully.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBandt has said that seeking a ministerial position would not be a priority for the party in the event of a hung parliament.\n\n\n\nThe Greens' relationship with Labor\n\nThe relationship between the Greens and Labor has also been fraught with tension, with both parties fighting to capture votes on the left side of politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the national level, the relationship between the Greens and Labor has never been a particularly happy one,\" Smith says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Initially, it was because there was a tension between Labor's union base and many of the environmental concerns and policies of the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More recently, it's had to do with that trend of left voters moving their support away from the Labor Party to the Greens, and the Greens using their position to pressure Labor to shift its legislative agenda in a more progressive direction.\"\n\n\n\n'They didn't see us coming'\n\nThe Greens are defending their record number of lower house seats, three of which turned Green for the first time at the last election, shocking both major parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three were inner-city Brisbane electorates. Griffith was won from Labor, while Brisbane and Ryan flipped from the Liberal National Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan, once considered a rock-solid Liberal seat, is now a key battleground the Coalition is determined to reclaim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The LNP thinks they own that seat. I ousted them in 2022. They didn't see us coming then. They are certainly seeing us coming now,\u201d Greens member for Ryan Elizabeth Watson-Brown says.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Climate Wars (Revisited): Party Time Ep 3 SBS News 17/04/2025 26:41 Play\n\nWatson-Brown says she's faced verbal abuse and her signs have been vandalised throughout her campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe blamed far-right groups who \"want to oust [her] from the seat\" and said she's also concerned about the misinformation and disinformation that's being spread about her.\n\n\n\nGreens eyeing more seats\n\nThis year, the Greens are hopeful of picking up another Queensland seat \u2014 Moreton \u2014 located in Brisbane's south.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreton's long-standing Labor MP Graham Perrett has held the seat since 2007 but is now retiring.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens candidate Remah Naji, a tertiary education worker and mother-of-two, says people have told her they are fed up with the two major parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They want action on the cost of living , groceries, childcare costs, rent increases, and mortgage stress,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have told me that they're ready for change.\"\n\n\n\nGreens candidate Remah Naji says she's expecting a swing toward the party in the electorate where she's running. Source: SBS News Naji, who is the daughter of Palestinian refugees and grew up in Jordan before moving to Australia 12 years ago, also points to the Palestinian territories being a key issue, especially among the 7,000 Muslim voters in the electorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're traditionally Labor voters and they're switching to the Greens,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere in the country, the Greens have their eyes on five other electorates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are the safe Labor seats of Wills and Macnamara in Victoria, as well as Richmond in NSW and Perth in WA.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso in their sights is the marginal Liberal seat of Sturt, South Australia.\n\n\n\nSheppard says the Greens are targeting seats with specific voter demographics, seeking to emulate their success in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe points to the Greens success in the seat of Ryan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ryan has a really nice mix for the Greens of university students who are frustrated about job security, housing security, and concerned about the environment,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It also has] wealthier people who are a little bit older, who have job security, quite a lot of wealth \u2014 and they are worried about the kinds of issues that affect their grandchildren, like access to education, health and climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's that concentration of wealthy boomers and Gen X voters, alongside university students, that makes Ryan so perfect.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

Maybe they will come next time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVoxie 2: \"We're not personally religious. However, we came here to obviously see the Pope go past. It is quite upsetting, obviously, because he\u2019s someone you see on the news, you see him on media all the time. So, yes, it's quite an emotional thing and it's amazing to see everyone come out, everyone clapping as he goes past.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLasting just 90 minutes, Pope Francis' funeral was significantly shorter than Pope St John Paul II's in 2005, which lasted three hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking with tradition even further, Pope Francis has elected to be the first pope buried outside of the Vatican in over a century.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has paid his respects, as millions of people around the world tuned in to watch the funeral of Pope Francis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIssuing a statement, Mr Albanese says Pope Francis will be remembered as someone whose compassion embraced all humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's highest-ranking Catholic official, Melbourne-based cardinal Mykola Bychok, says Pope Francis led the church with love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was a pope of mercy, not just in word but in action. He reached out to the poor, the excluded, the wounded. He taught us not to judge but to accompany. He reminded us again and again, that no one is beyond the reach of God's love.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Catholic Church now begins nine days of official mourning for Francis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the mourning, cardinals aged under 80 will elect a new pope.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has met US President Donald Trump in their first face-to-face meeting since their Oval Office clash in February.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth leaders met ahead of Pope Francis' funeral.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a post on social media, following the meeting, Mr Trump says he now holds doubts that a peace deal can be finalised soon, saying things are complicated by Russia's actions over the last few days in shooting missiles into civilian areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comments contrast with his earlier remarks to reporters about the outcome of a meeting between special envoy Steve Witkoff and Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter: \"What do you hope Steve Witkoff will get out of his meeting with Putin today?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: \"He'll be calling me.

    "text": "Influencers were once confined to the squares on our social media pages and not considered serious players in the media industry, but as their power grows \u2014 so does their range.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce associated with fashion, makeup and lighthearted lifestyle videos, Australians are also increasingly turning to them for their views on more serious issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a trend that politicians have also noticed. This year, for the first time, some influencers were flown to Canberra to cover the federal budget \u2014 an event that is typically the domain of political journalists and finance experts.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage of the budget was transformed at the hands of content creators like mental health advocate Milly Rose Bannister, Cheek media co-founder Hannah Ferguson and podcast host Daphne Berry.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Influencers respond after revelations Labor paid for federal budget travel for some\n\nRather than writing articles about the budget, they posted TikTok videos and Instagram reels, and shared information with their followers via Instagram stories.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the lead up to the election , many are encouraging their followers to engage with politics and policy \u2014 and it's working.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisbane woman Emina is 29 years old and has never been interested in politics, but after following influencer and podcast host Abbie Chatfield, she was motivated to update her voting details and keep up to date with this year's election.\n\n\n\n\n\nChatfield first gained a public profile after appearing on TV show The Bachelor and is now a podcast host and media personality.\n\n\n\nAbbie Chatfield was once a contestant on The Bachelor, but is now a podcast host and media personality. Source: AAP / Darren England In the lead-up to the election, Chatfield has interviewed Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Greens leader Adam Bandt, hosted a DJ event with Bandt and the Greens, and made regular posts about the election and policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've followed Abby since she was on The Bachelor, and she's always been really opinionated and I love her for that,\" Emina said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've always found her to be making it engaging and bringing to the surface the things that are often not spoken about enough.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE A former Triple J host is hoping his Uber 'side-hustle' will help him unseat a Liberal MP\n\nEmina said she believes influencers speaking about politics can be empowering and educational for their followers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Chatfield has openly said she personally supports the Greens, Emina said she hasn't felt pressured to vote the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I haven't found Abbie to be forceful to tell me who to vote for, so that's also something that I've really respected \u2026 her message has been one of empowerment,\" she said.\n\n\n\nIt's a 'responsibility' to be part of the conversation\n\nFor Holly Rankin, who also performs as a singer-songwriter and recording artist under the name Jack River, pop culture and policy have always been linked.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside her professional music career, Rankin has been involved in campaigns and activism for years. She is also the co-founder of Sentiment, a strategic communications and creative agency that aims to bridge the gap between politics and pop culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nRankin believes online content creators are often not taken seriously by older generations or traditional media and argues the term 'influencer' can be used to denigrate or dismiss their work and advocacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the end of the day, they're likely very good communicators who are passionate about something and they've grown an online community who have shared values with them,\" she said.\n\n\n\nSinger Jack River, whose real name is Holly Rankin, supports musicians and content creators who speak about politics and policy. Source: Supplied This election, Rankin believes young voters and social media are becoming more powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a 2024 report from the Australian Communications and Media Authority, 46 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds nominated social media as their main source of news, and 31 per cent said celebrities and influencers were sources of their news content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The voting electorate is younger, and I think the world is in a really kind of frightening spot for a lot of younger people, so it's inspiring them to lean into politics,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Content creators are seeing not even an opportunity, more like a responsibility, to jump in and be part of the conversation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the election predicted to be close, Rankin said young voters could be the people who decide the results, particularly in marginal seats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it's really important that they get good information and that they engage and also just learn about civics and politics,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they're not getting it [from] politicians themselves, if they're not reading the news, how else are they going to get this information?\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE From OnlyFans to Fortnite, politicians are exploring new avenues for attention in 2025\n\nYouth vote is transforming the election campaign\n\nWith millennials and gen Z voters now outnumbering baby boomers on the electoral roll, appealing to younger voters is becoming increasingly important to political parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), there are 1,831,800 voters aged 18 to 24 enrolled for the 2025 election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe youth enrolment rate, which tracks eligible voters in this age group, is sitting at 92 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Susan Grantham, a lecturer in communication at Griffith University, believes social media has become \"absolutely essential\" in politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn platforms like Instagram and TikTok, Grantham said influencers have a \"stronger hold over the audience\" and may have more sway than posts made by candidates or political parties, which politicians are starting to realise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's always been influencers out there that have been politically aligned and have promoted politics during election campaigns previously,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she said this election, political parties and leaders were now doing joint posts and podcasts with influencers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's going to be highly influential and far more influential than what we would expect from a politician directly,\" Grantham said.\n\n\n\nDr Susan Grantham says social media has become an essential tool in political campaigns.

Source: SBS News Fellow content creator Daphne Berry said she believes many young voters turn to new media platforms for more relatable discussions about politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBerry, who hosts the music podcast Airing Your Dirty Laundry, told SBS News her platform is \"about learning\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm completely out of my depth in a lot of ways, but [I try] to come in and really learn and really listen to people who perhaps know a bit more than I do and ask questions,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[I then] explain it to people who ... don't fully understand what's going on in the country.\"\n\n\n\nCriticism of influencers and AEC investigation\n\nNot everyone is on board with new media and influencers becoming involved in politics\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen content creators were invited to the federal Budget lockup in March, critics labelled the influencers as \"self-obsessed\" and questioned whether they were paid to attend.\n\n\n\n\n\nClips of Chatfield's interviews with Bandt and Albanese were reviewed by the AEC after Liberal senator Jane Hume questioned if they had breached electoral rules by not including an authorisation statement.\n\n\n\nThe posts were cleared of breaching any laws, with the AEC finding no evidence the podcaster had been paid for any political posts, or that Albanese or Bandt had any creative control in the interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Chatfield accused the Liberal Party of trying to discredit influencers speaking on politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm all for the AEC making sure that everything goes by regulations [so] that we have safe and fair elections,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the reality is there was no reason to question the integrity of my posts because I repeatedly stated publicly that I was not paid.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChatfield said she believed the Liberal Party was trying to \"minimise the impact of influencers and new media\" and discourage content creators from speaking about politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Grantham, new media and influencers largely play a positive role in politics and education, but she acknowledged it is a \"tricky space\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have to be careful that we don't let the traditional news media die; it still has a very solid place in politics,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we do see is influencers taking on a similar role, and some of them are doing that very, very well, but they don't have to work to the same ethical codes or media law that go along with this sort of public commentary.\"\n\n\n\nWhile many content creators produce educational content, they do not have the same obligations that journalists do in terms of fact-checking and impartiality. This can allow misinformation, disinformation, or biased content to spread online .\n\n\n\n\n\nGrantham believes young people need to be taught how to question what they see and to think critically about social media and political commentary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But until we as a society are really good at doing that, there's obviously always going to be potential negatives,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a time of climate crisis, conflict, and global uncertainty, Rankin believes young voters and social media can ultimately play a part in creating a better future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel critically concerned [about the future], but I know we can write a new story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel optimistic, but there is a lot of work to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Australia's housing crisis has been a key focus in pitches to voters during the federal election campaign, with a particular emphasis on first-home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut whether you rent or buy, the Grattan Institute says the lack of housing affordability is exacerbated by one key issue: the lack of supply.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrendan Coates, program director of housing and economic security at Grattan Institute, said: \"We've not built enough housing to meet the needs of our growing population.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is largely because state land use planning regimes have made it too hard to build more homes in the established suburbs of our major cities,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Master Builders Australia said building the average house had blown out from nine months to 12.7 months \u2014 a 40 per cent increase \u2014 since 2010-11.\n\n\n\nIn areas closer to the city, it said the slow pace of development applications and height and density restrictions placed on big developments were part of the \"red tape\" slowing down construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the biggest levers for boosting construction sit with state and territory governments, which oversee planning and building regulations, Coates argues the Commonwealth still plays a role in increasing housing supply.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts have weighed in on how the major parties are addressing bottlenecks in the industry and increasing supply, as well as what more needs to be done.\n\n\n\nWhat have the major parties pledged on housing?\n\nA quick recap of the main housing pitches to voters from the major parties:\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor\n\n\n\nWill expand the First Home Guarantee scheme and the Help to Buy shared equity loan scheme, both of which will allow first-time home buyers to buy a home with a deposit of 5 per cent or less. However, the latter gives the government a 30 to 40 per cent stake in your home.\n\nBuild 100,000 new affordable homes exclusively for first home buyers, with construction starting in 2026/27.\n\nProvide a $10,000 incentive for apprentices in housing construction \u2014 paid in instalments \u2014 in a bid to speed up the construction of homes.\n\nAim to deliver 55,000 social and affordable homes over five years under the Housing Australia Future Fund \u2014 which will be scrapped by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition\n\n\n\nFirst home buyers will be able to access $50,000 of their superannuation for a deposit.\n\nThey will also be able to claim tax deductions on interest payments against the first $650,000 of their mortgage in the first five years.\n\nA $5 billion fund to build infrastructure such as sewerage and water will be set up to support the construction of 500,000 new homes.\n\nBusinesses that employ apprentices in areas with a skills shortage can receive a payment of $12,000 per year for the first two years.\n\nThe Coalition believes cutting migration will alleviate pressure on the housing market, pledging to reduce net migration levels by 100,000 places.\n\nWhat effect will these policies have on supply?\n\nDr Liam Davies, a lecturer in urban planning and sustainability at RMIT University, said both major parties are tackling supply through different approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS News the Liberal Party wants to ensure the right infrastructure is in place ahead of development, through its $5 billion fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, Labor would facilitate supply by actively intervening in the market, directly funding projects like 100,000 homes for first-time buyers.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian federal election 2025 explained: Everything you need to know\n\nAre we on track to build enough homes?\n\nIn August 2023, the National Cabinet agreed on a target of building 1.2 million \"new, well-located homes\" across the country by 2029.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve the target, 60,000 homes need to be built every quarter. In 2024, roughly 45,000 houses and units were built each quarter \u2014 a total of 181,789, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grattan Institute estimates the target is unlikely to be met, forecasting 900,000 homes will be built over the five years.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, roughly 45,000 houses and units were built each quarter \u2014 a total of 181,789, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Source: SBS News Coates argues the Homes Accord target should be revised to incentivise states to build more. Currently, federal funding incentives for each home built are dependent on that jurisdiction reaching its individual target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's not really a real incentive for the states to act to get more housing built, because even if they do, they will struggle to meet that baseline of one million homes, let alone the 1.2 million,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we need to revise that target down, that baseline down, so that states start to qualify for the $15,000 [per home] if they do act.\"\n\n\n\nWhat else can government do to speed up development?\n\n\"There hasn't been a harder time to build more housing anytime in the last 20 years,\" Coates said, attributing this to a spike in construction costs, interest rates making financing projects more difficult, and shortages in skilled labour.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the federal government could \"speed the process up\" by getting more skilled migrants into the country and financing new construction \u2014 acknowledging the latter is part of Labor's pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\nDenita Wawn, CEO of Master Builders Australia, estimates the industry needs roughly 200,000 more workers to meet demand. She has repeatedly called for the fast-tracking of tradie visas, warning the gap cannot be met domestically alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know there's at least 20,000 skilled migrants in the country at the moment that are finding it difficult to get their skills recognised and undertake their gap training,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nLabor has since announced it will fast-track the qualification of at least 6,000 tradies already in the industry through a $78 million program that will help recognise prior learning and identify gaps for further training, which will be offered for free.\n\n\n\n\n\nWawn said Labor's pilot program is not enough to compete with priority pathways offered by other countries, urging both parties to clearly lay out their skilled migration strategies to voters ahead of 3 May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Where both parties have let us down is [there's] really no policies on the issue around skilled migration,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Opposition immigration spokesperson Dan Tehan said skilled migration would make up the bulk of a Coalition government's cuts to permanent migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nWawn did note that the Coalition were \"ahead\" of Labor when it came to apprentices, given they will provide $12,000 to employers if they hire apprentices in areas with a skills shortage; and will also back Labor's apprenticeship program that will provide $10,000 to apprentices directly if they complete their qualification.\n\n\n\nMaster Builders Australia says more skilled workers are key to expediting the building of houses. Other bottlenecks the industry faces are planning delays for things like development applications, title approvals and occupancy certificates \u2014 all of which reduce the capacity to build more homes quickly, although responsibility for these sits with local and state governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWawn acknowledged Labor is the only party to mention working in collaboration with states and territories to address the issue of housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, she credits the Coalition with having a \"deregulation focus\". In March, Opposition Treasury spokesperson Angus Taylor committed to establishing a productivity taskforce to assess the cost of regulation and how to reduce red tape.\n\n\n\n\n\nWawn concludes the parties are \"neck-and-neck\" at the moment, but argues the 1.2 million build target is achievable if these issues are addressed.\n\n\n\nWhere should we be building homes?\n\nFrom a planning perspective, Davies said homes need to be built near infrastructure and utilities \u2014 including parks, schools, hospitals \u2014 and conducive to people having socially engaged lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can achieve this by either developing areas near existing infrastructure, or by building infrastructure to allow easier access to greenfield sites, which are undeveloped plots of land typically on the outskirts of urban areas, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you want to live in an urban area, the Labor policy may suit your lifestyle slightly better,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you want to live in an outer suburban area, the Liberal Party policy may suit your lifestyle slightly better.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe argues while both are crucial, the government needs to focus on diversifying the type of homes being built. He highlights there is a gap for family homes \u2014 three or four-bedroom apartments \u2014 in urban areas.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia is building a million new homes \u2014 but we may not want to live in them\n\nWhich party will boost home ownership?\n\nCoates said first home buyers on lower incomes will be able to buy homes they might not otherwise have access to, through Labor's first home buyer guarantee and shared equity schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut high-income earners, who are more likely to be able to buy a home, will be the greatest beneficiaries of the Coalition's tax deduction on existing mortgages scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Labor is more likely to boost the rate of home ownership. The Coalition will allow wealthier people to buy bigger homes than otherwise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

A narrator who seems to be a newcomer to Australia tries iconic dishes like a vanilla slice, pavlova, supermarket hot chook, Bubble O'Bill ice cream and a Bunnings 'sausage sizzle'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comment section is full of Australians praising the narrator's calm Korean commentary and sense of wonder at everyday foods, with fans offering recommendations for more classics, such as Arnott's Shapes and Milo.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter feedback about how they prepared a hot cross bun \"wrong\", Aus Foodiee thanked fans and gave it another go in a second video, where they were judged to have prepared it properly \u2014 toasted with lots of butter.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat fans don't know is that the account is actually the work of two Korean men \u2014 Mingoo Lee and Jungho Choi.\n\n\n\nAbout Aussie life and going viral\n\nIn their first-ever interview \u2014 where they revealed their faces and names \u2014 the Aus Foodiee creators spoke to SBS News about how life in Australia has been a surprising treat since arriving two months ago on working holiday visas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some people don't use shoes here.

And I think food has a very special energy,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't expect us to have an encouraging and powerful effect, but someday we are going to make this channel bigger and bigger and bigger.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Is Indonesian the new Thai? Why the cuisine is having a moment in Australia\n\nThe sausage sizzle phenomenon\n\nTheir most popular video, with nearly a million views on Instagram and TikTok combined, is the homemade sausage sizzle.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoi caramelises onions, pan-fries a packet of sausages and serves them on white bread with ketchup.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking in Korean with auto-generated English captions, Lee says in the video: \"This is said to be the national dish of Australians ... I think it's also called Bunnings sausage sizzle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How to make it is easier than you think.\"\n\n\n\nAs is often the case with their dishes, fans who frequently comment on their posts gave them another idea, so they filmed a trip to get a sausage in bread from Bunnings, describing it as \"meaningful food\".\n\n\n\n\n\nChoi and Lee said they weren't sure why so many people loved the sausage video in particular, but they thought the meal was one of the tastiest they've had.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe duo laughed, saying they were surprised the sausages were so thin.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving also learned about it from the comments section, they will go to get a 'democracy sausage' on election day on 3 May .\n\n\n\nWhat are the duo's favourite dishes?\n\nSo what's Lee's favourite dish he discovered in two months in Australia?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kebab.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoi's favourite is the hot cross bun, though he really enjoys Japanese food.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey said Australia's food scene should be described as multicultural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can try every country's food, but some are not as good as others,\" Lee said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the Korean food they tried in Melbourne was nice but not spicy enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe duo plan to make as many videos as they can while in Australia, most likely whatever their audience suggests Choi should cook.\n\n\n\n",

It sounds like a breeze when you say it like that. Slip, Slop, Slap! In the sun this summer say 'Slip, Slop, Slap!' Slip, Slop, Slap!'\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1981, the famous Slip, Slop Slap campaign stormed our screens and airwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nSid the Seagull was enlisted to encourage Aussies to seek protection from ultraviolet or U-V damage from the sun.\n\n\n\n\n\n44 years on and the Cancer Councils of Australia and Bureau of Statistics have done a study that shows while the song still slaps.. it seems the message has slipped.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Anne Cust studies cancer in populations as an epidemiologist and Chair of the Cancer Council's National Skin Cancer Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One in five young Australians have tried to get a suntan in the past year and only about half of Australians are using adequate sun protection.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis alarming trend comes as the rate of melanoma continues to rise - 16,800 Australians will likely be diagnosed this year - one every thirty minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration Z are educated on sun safety - so why aren't younger Australians following the rules?\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Stephen Dann - a marketing expert at the Australian National University - says social media is a big factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first thing is they are a young audience who are very driven by immediate outcomes. I get a tan, I look aesthetically pleasing to myself and the people around me. I look good. I feel great. I have a consequence coming to me in 35 years' time. That is future me's problem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 Australian of the Year, Professor Georgina Long, is the joint number one expert in the world in melanoma research.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is frustrated by the rules around what influencers in Australia can advertise online.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can't spruik products with an S-P-F rating including sunblock, but they can use their platforms to share information about non-therapeutic goods, like tan accelerants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, people put these creams on to go in the sun and get a more accelerated tan more quickly. That is dangerous, that is a carcinogen, that is cancer causing. Do we need legislation about that? Do we need to free up guidelines around advertising good sunscreens. At the moment, good sunscreens, we're not able to advertise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2022, the Therapeutic Goods Administration banned social media testimonials around products or devices that claim a medical or therapeutic benefit - including skincare and vitamins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rule can apply to any description of the qualities of a product with S-P-F protection, including sunblock.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Dann says the rules that were designed to protect consumers, may have had the opposite effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were more worried about food contamination, or someone being offered a miracle cure for something that wasn't curable. That sunscreen got swept up as a consequence was one of those unfortunate outcomes of good policy, bad implementation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs TikTok trends, including hashtag sunburnt tan lines gather hundreds of millions of views - the Cancer Council is fighting back with its End the Trend campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nSix high profile Australian social media influencers have spent the past month staying out of the sun, rejecting fake tan and guiding their followers to the shade.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline influencer Tayla Broad was motivated to end the trend, because she saw how skin cancer impacted loved ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can all be aware just how damaging the tanning culture can be, even with the likes of fake tanning. So, join me on this journey to challenge the way we view tanning and why we feel the need to tan to be beautiful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Cust sees the irony in tanning trending in an online space dominated by beauty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"UV radiation that you get from the sun, there are different types of UV radiation. UVA is responsible for a lot of the ageing that we see from the sun exposure and the UVB is responsible for a lot of the burning. So, if you are concerned about beauty, it is much better to stay out of the sun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Long has pioneered and led research into immunotherapy treatments for melanoma that mean a diagnosis that was deadly in 2010, now has an above-fifty-fifty chance of a cure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a handshake that the cancer cell would give the immune system or the immune cells so that the immune cells would say 'this is my friend, this is my family, off I go, I won't kill you.' But these drugs, checkpoint inhibitors, interrupt that handshake and allow those immune T cells to kill the cancer cells, the melanoma cancer cells. So those drugs which we started working with around that 2010 period absolutely revolutionised how we later treated melanoma.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a monumental feat she and her colleagues have achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Professor Long is united with experts who agree prevention is the best cure - and the second line of defence is a skin check.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn online melanoma risk assessment tool is available at melanoma risk dot org dot a-u.\n\n\n\n",

Many in the 300-person crowd wave Labor-branded \u201cAlbo\u201d placards during the leaders\u2019 speeches. But just as many here today are waving green and gold posters that say \u201cmore bulk-billing\u201d, complete with the Medicare logo. It is another indication of how strongly Labor is seeking to tie its brand to Medicare at this year\u2019s election.\n\nAlbanese whips out his Medicare card again. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nAlbanese, once again, whips out his own Medicare card \u2013 a near-daily campaign stunt at this point. \u201cThe fact that this card is green and gold is no accident. We take pride in it as Australians, just as we take pride in that other great Labor reform, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ... A vote for Labor is a vote for Medicare,\u201d Albanese says.\n\n\u201cToday, we add to the strengthening Medicare agenda. A re-elected Labor government will make free, urgent care available to all Australians, in every community, with the launch of 1800 MEDICARE.

If it\u2019s something that can\u2019t wait for your regular GP, you\u2019ll be connected to a free GP telehealth consultation. Life isn\u2019t 9 to 5. With 1800 MEDICARE, neither is healthcare.\u201d",

    "text": "For over a decade, a group of Aussie friends have run a website detailing which voting booths offer the election day staple.\n\nAnthony Albanese and Peter Dutton are facing off. But the most important for many Aussies is where they can get a great-tasting democracy sausage. Source: AAP\n\nMany voters are facing a bigger question than policies announced by Labor, Liberal, Greens or Independent. They\u2019re wondering where they can find the best democracy sausage on election day.\n\nWhile democracies around the world face mounting threats, Aussie voters generally approach polling booths with a light heart. And they're rewarded for their efforts with the chance to support a local community group by purchasing a snag with white bread, onions, and tomato sauce.\n\nOr controversially, maybe even mustard, barbecue sauce, or worse still, plain.\n\nAnnette Tyler was one of the founders of the Democracy Sausage website back in 2013. Today, it lists over 900 locations where voters can find themselves a snag. So if you're wondering where to find a tasty snag on election day, all you need to do is click here.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe one thing that brings everyone together is the democracy sausage,\u201d she told Yahoo News.\n\nThe website continues to be run by the group of mates, and now includes other offerings like cupcakes, vegetarian food, bacon and eggs, coffee, and halal. There\u2019s also a handy column showing which locations are wheelchair accessible.\n\nThe democracy sausage website has received over 900 submissions for listing ahead of the federal election. Source: Democracy Sausage.\n\nWorst sausage eater of all time revealed\n\nThe team don\u2019t own the slogan democracy sausage, and have never sought to commercialise it. But they do offer merchandise now that\u2019s sold at a price that covers the costs of production.\n\nThis year, in what must be one of the first times a food company has released election-themed produce, Masterfoods is selling its own brand of democracy sauce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an independent thing. They did let us know about it,\u201d Annette said.\n\n\u201cBut our principle is generally to stay non-partisan and to avoid commercial entanglements.\u201d\n\nAccording to one expert, Bill Shorten is responsible for the worst-ever attempt at eating a sausage. Source: 7 News\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOver the years, politicians have been roasted over their clumsy attempts to eat sausages. There\u2019s one famous shot of Opposition Leader Peter Dutton eating a Dagwood dog at the 2022 Ekka show in Brisbane that often does the rounds on social media. And a couple of years ago, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s aids tried to shield him from the cameras using his jacket, but it didn\u2019t stop photographers from getting a short clip of him wolfing down his snag.\n\nBut for Annette award for the most disastrous attempt to eat a sausage still goes to a now retired former Prime Ministerial hopeful. \u201cNothing is ever going to eclipse Bill Shorten, right? That's an all-time classic,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI feel like after that, they\u2019ve all been trained in eating democracy sausages.\u201d\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

Source: Tom Forrest/Outback Tom/TikTok\n\nFor the past few years, a popular Aussie duo have been entertaining millions around the world with videos of their bush adventures.\n\nFrom whipping up pizzas and cinnamon scrolls by a campfire, to clever DIY projects like turning old trees into bird boxes, Tom Forrest and his grandfather Stephen, 72, delightfully dubbed \u2018Outback Grandad\u2019, have garnered many fans with glimpses into their life in Western Australia's Kimberley region.\n\nMost recently, the pair debuted a handmade backyard Korean BBQ in their signature \u201cbush style\u201d and constructed entirely out of recycled materials. Viewers have praised the \u201cexcellent\u201d idea.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News Australia, Tom said the pair designed the project after he moved back to the area from Sydney. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of Korean barbecue before until I\u2019d essentially travelled to the city,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter dining at a few restaurants, not only did Tom become a fan of the food, but he enjoyed the inclusivity of having everyone gathered around a central grill, cooking and eating together.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about backyard barbecues in the Outback or across the country, I sort of recognise that it separates the cook from the rest of the people,\u201d he told Yahoo. \u201cIt\u2019s typically one person\u2019s responsibility to cook the barbecue and then bring the food over.\n\n\u201cSo I took inspiration from the Korean barbecue set-up and wanted to bring that to the Outback and basically create this 44-gallon drum contraption which could seat up to five people.\u201d\n\nBackyard Korean BBQ crafted from recycled materials\n\nIn a video posted to TikTok, the pair took other Aussies through a step-by-step guide of how to create their own backyard Korean BBQ using items they may have stashed in the back of a shed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe foundation of the Korean barbecue is a 44 gallon drum. These are really popular in the Kimberley, so we have access to them relatively easy,\u201d Tom said. The next key component is finding a \u201cmini charcoal barbecue\u201d, which can be found in most camping stores, and will sit inside a hole cut out of the top of the drum.\n\n\u201cWe then took a piece of plywood to use for our table and cut a hole in the interior part of the board so we could slide the board over the 44-gallon drum, and then we also cut a circle on the exterior part of the board so that we had a round table,\u201d Tom explained. After then it\u2019s just a matter of putting all the pieces together.\n\nHow can I make a Korean BBQ like Outback Grandad?\n\nCut a hole in the top of the of the 44-gallon drum so the mini charcoal barbecue sits flush on top.\n\nMake four steel L-shaped brackets to hold the plywood table. Drill them into the side of the drum, making sure they are \u201cnice and level\u201d.\n\nCut a hole in the interior part of a large piece of plywood so you can slide it over the drum.\n\nCut a circle on the exterior part of the board to form a round table with a hole in the centre.\n\nSmooth the edges of the wood using a sander and apply a coat of lacquer so it can be easily wiped with a cloth.\n\nPlace the drum in its desired location.\n\nPut the barbecue in the hole, place heated charcoals inside and the grill on top.\n\nSlide the table over the drum and rest it on the brackets.\n\nCook up a feast for friends and family.\n\nStephen and Tom created the backyard Korean BBQ using a 44-gallon drum, a mini charcoal barbecue, and a piece of plywood. Source: Tom Forrest/Outback Tom/TikTok\n\nOutback duo pleased as DIY project 'works perfectly'\n\nTom told Yahoo he and his grandad also added an airflow vent to help control the temperature, but it is probably not necessary.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe also cut out a hole in the side of the drum, so we could reach our hand through to adjust the air flow of the charcoal barbecue. If we want more heat, we can open it up to allow more oxygen to come in, and if we need the charcoal grill less hot, we can close that and reduce the oxygen intake as well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vent is lined with a rubber seal the pair pulled off of an old car on the back of their rural property. It prevents any cuts or grazes from the sharp edges of the hole.\n\n\u201cThe concept and the design started off as a drawing, and then to finally have it in the backyard, get the charcoal barbecue cranking, have marinated meats and various side dishes on the table \u2014 I then invited the rest of the family out the back to join us \u2014 and it worked absolutely perfectly,\u201d Tom said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
