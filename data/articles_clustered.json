(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty) (AP)\n\nLast month, Treasurer Jim Chalmers requested the Productivity Commission carry out an urgent inquiry into the effect of structural steel imports on the local market.\n\nAustralian steel fabricators, commonly small to medium-sized businesses, told the investigation a flood of cheap imported products were leaving them uncompetitive.\n\nIndustry Minister Tim Ayres said the government was standing up for Australian businesses in support of free and fair trade.\n\n\"This is because Australia's prosperity is linked to open and rules-based trade \u2013 one in four Australian jobs depend on trade,\" he said.\n\n\"When trade is not fair, the government will stand up for Australian farmers, manufacturers and workers.\"\n\n\"This includes applying measures at the border to address unfair imports.\"\n\nChina's sluggish construction sector has led to a glut of steel made there, triggering a flood of shipments to overseas markets.\n\nAccording to Commonwealth Bank of Australia analysis, Chinese crude steel output fell by 4.4 per cent last year \u2013 marking the largest annual fall since the data began in 1990.\n\nWhile heavy US tariffs have deterred Chinese steel importers, other markets, including Australia, became export targets.\n\nThe move by Australia was in addition to temporary tariffs ranging form 35 per cent and 113 per cent on steel products, which started last December.\n\nDumping, defined by the World Trade Organisation, is a form of price discrimination, involving selling a product in the importing country at less than the price in the market where it is made.\n\nThe latest tariffs come after warmer trade relations between Canberra and Beijing since the 2022 election victory of the Albanese government.\n\nIt followed years of bitter trade disputes under the former Morrison government when bilateral relations chilled over suspicions of Chinese interference in Australia increased.\n\nChina also hit out at Australia's call for an inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and allegations it was seeking to intimidate members of the Chinese-Australian community.",

But it was never going to stop her from trying.\n\nThe 41-year-old American had made a comeback this season from six years out of the sport after having a partial knee replacement in her right leg.\n\nIt had been a huge success too, with Vonn winning three World Cup events and standing on the podium a total of seven times across downhill and Super G events.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic downhill champion was ranked number one in the World Cup downhill standings coming into the Olympics and third in Super G, giving rise to hopes that she could add to her three Olympic medals 24 years after her debut in Salt Lake City.\n\nVonn set the third-fastest time in the final downhill training session on Saturday.\n\nLindsey Vonn had been skiing superbly. (Getty Images: Al Bello)\n\nGiven her injury though, her final Olympics always had the potential to turn into a nightmare, the fairytale comeback ending in tears on the mountainside.\n\nGold medallist Breezy Johnson, also of the USA, said she hoped Vonn would be able to compete again.\n\n\"I don't claim to know what she's going through but I do know what it's like to be here, to be fighting for the Olympics and to have this course burn you and to watch those dreams die,\" Johnson said.\n\nBreezy Johnson claimed gold for Team USA.

(AP: Jacquelyn Martin)\n\n\"It is a critical section [where Vonn crashed], because it's in the beginning, and you really need a lot of speed coming out of it. It's super flat after it, so the goal is to be as close to that gate as possible,\" she said.\n\n\"She really nailed the turn, but she was too close to it, so she was hooked into it. But that's how it is with the Olympics \u2014 you really want to be at the limit, and she was a little bit over the limit.\"\n\nLie said having the opportunity to compete with Vonn was incredible and added that despite Vonn's injury, she would not be surprised to see her on the World Cup start list later in the year.\n\n\"I'm really happy she came back so I can compete with her at least one more year, and learn from her as much as possible,\" Lie said.\n\n\"I'm crossing my fingers for her, and I hope to see her back.\n\nThe crowd were emotional after the crash.

    "text": "Australia is in a deep housing crisis.\n\nThe latest National Housing Supply and Affordability Council analysis shows the country is likely to fall more than a quarter-of-a-million homes short of the federal government's target to build 1.2 million homes by 2029. Its data shows only around 938,000 dwellings are expected to be built in the five-year period, leaving a shortfall of about 262,000.\n\nAnother economic estimate suggests demand exceeds supply by 200,000 to 300,000 homes, pushing prices and rents higher as Australians compete for a limited stock of houses.\n\nThis gap between demand and supply is why many voices in policy and industry argue traditional ways of building houses are too slow and too expensive.\n\nAs Bunnings, Australia's biggest hardware retailer, starts selling tiny homes, it feels like a turning point.\n\nBut are backyard pods the answer to a national housing crisis?\n\nPrefab and modular homes in Australia\n\nIn response to slow and costly traditional building, many in industry and government have pointed to modern solutions such as modular, prefab or even 3D-printed homes as a key part of the solution.\n\nThe idea is to make components or whole sections of homes in dedicated facilities and then assemble them quickly on site.\n\nAre 'flatpack' homes Australia's future? From early colonial settlers to the post-war construction boom, prefabricated and modular housing has a long history in Australia. Can factory-built homes fix our housing woes and help the climate?\n\nRecent government analysis shows some of these factory-based homes can be built up to 50 per cent faster than conventional construction, helping speed housing delivery.\n\nThe market for prefab and modular buildings is growing in Australia and globally.\n\nThe Australian prefab construction sector is valued at $12.91 billion and is forecast to grow by about 7.88 per cent a year.\n\nHowever, these methods account for less than 8 per cent of the construction sector.\n\nThis is far below countries such as Sweden, where prefab makes up a majority of detached housing.\n\nBunnings' pods novel but not the solution\n\nBunnings has recently started selling flat-pack backyard pods that have captured attention.\n\nThe pods, small modular units costing from about $26,000, can be assembled in days.\n\nAt first glance, this looks like an affordable housing innovation. But the reality is more nuanced.\n\nThese pods are fundamentally temporary. Their size, layout and fit-out reflect short-term or secondary use rather than long-term residential living.\n\nBesides this, many pods avoid full planning or building approval in some locations, which is a strong signal they are being treated, legally, as ancillary structures.\n\nThey are most useful as offices, studios, guest rooms or extra space but unlikely to be suitable as permanent homes for families.\n\nWhile the price is eye-catching, it does not include site preparation, ground works, connections for power and water, or any compliance costs, all of which can add substantially to the final price.\n\nBuyers would also need somewhere to put the pod \u2014 either owning land, or being able to use someone else's.\n\nPermits and approvals may be required depending on the location and intended use, further complicating the picture.\n\nBunnings has not said it is entering the housing market to help solve the national crisis. But its decision to partner with prefab manufacturers comes as major lenders and builders are embracing factory-built housing as part of broader affordability responses, and as analysts note growing consumer interest in faster, lower-cost housing options amid soaring property prices.\n\nThe market for prefab and modular buildings is growing in Australia and globally. (ABC News: Joel Wilson)\n\nWhy scale matters\n\nThe key to reducing housing costs through industrialised construction is scale.\n\nWhen production levels are small, factories cannot spread fixed costs over many units.\n\nThis results in high prices, even if units can be completed quickly.\n\nIn countries where factory-built housing works at scale, companies build the same homes repeatedly. That allows workers to get faster and factories to spread the cost of specialised equipment across many homes. They also have strong supply chains for components and labour.\n\nBy comparison, Australia's sector is still small and most manufacturers produce only a handful of units each year.\n\nWithout big volumes and steady demand, off-site building can't unlock real cost reductions.\n\nThat said, Bunnings's entry is noteworthy.\n\nIt shows mainstream retail channels see a business opportunity in modular building products. It may help raise public awareness of alternative construction methods in everyday Australian life.\n\nWhat are the long-term fixes?\n\nThe housing challenge will not be solved by pods.\n\nWhat is needed is much larger investment into these alternative methods of construction, from both state and federal governments, aligned with international partnerships that bring technology, expertise and industrial scale.\n\nCountries that have succeeded in using factory-built homes at scale have done so through coordinated policy support, strong industrial strategies, workforce training and investment in manufacturing facilities.\n\nSome also combine this with land reform, faster approvals and direct procurement of homes for public needs.\n\nA way forward\n\nBunnings's backyard pods may be an interesting new product line.\n\nThey can provide extra space and appeal to certain buyers but they are not a long-term housing solution for most Australians.\n\nBunnings is riding the shift toward factory-built housing but the real shift is bigger: Australia needs to build high-quality homes at scale, not just sell small pods.\n\nAustralia needs a dramatic expansion of factory-based building capacity, supported by policy, investment and a clear pathway from small prototypes to large-volume, high-quality homes for communities in need.\n\nEhsan Noroozinejad is a senior researcher and Sustainable Future Lead at the Urban Transformations Research Centre at Western Sydney University.

(ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nMcNamara's exit will trigger a by-election in the Darwin-based Nightcliff seat, one of the territory's most progressive.\n\nNightcliff was held by Labor for 24 consecutive years, before McNamara beat former chief minister Natasha Fyles to win it for the Greens in 2024.\n\nThe by-election will be the first test for Labor Opposition Leader Selena Uibo since the party was thumped at the 2024 election.\n\nLabor was left with just four remote-based seats in the 25-seat parliament.\n\nIn her statement, Kat McNamara said she hopes the next member for Nightcliff will reflect the electorate's \"progressive\" character. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nIn her statement, McNamara said she hoped her successor honoured the progressive \"values and spirit\" of the electorate.\n\n\"Nightcliff is uniquely progressive, engaged, and full of hope, and must be represented by someone who truly listens and is led by this community,\" she said.\n\n\"That is something I have strived to do every day as the Member for Nightcliff, and I hope that my successor honours the values and spirit of this wonderful place.\"\n\n'Paved the way'\n\nNT Greens party convenor Jonathan Parry said McNamara had made an \"enormous contribution\" to the Nightcliff electorate.\n\nGreens make history with first NT politician The Greens are set to claim an historic victory in the Northern Territory election, winning their first ever territory seat in what was once Labor's safest electorate.\n\n\"Supporting and listening to constituents, hosting regular community dinners, film nights, policy information sessions, and starting Nightcliff's first community pantry,\" he said.\n\n\"In parliament, they have been a strong advocate for climate action, gambling reform, integrity, social justice, renters' rights, and for raising awareness of the ongoing genocide in Palestine.\n\n\"They have re-imagined what it means to be a member of the Legislative Assembly and have paved the way for strong progressive representation into the future.\"\n\nNT Speaker Robyn Lambley said the NT's acting administrator and chief minister had been advised of McNamara's resignation.",

(ABC Radio Sydney: Aston Brown)\n\n\"We know from experience that whenever you put cyclists and pedestrians and cars and coaches [dropping people at the market] all in one busy environment, it's a recipe for absolute disaster,\" Cr Miller said.\n\n\"We had been advocating [to the state government] for a separated cycleway since the very start,\" she said. \"At every juncture where we requested, pleaded, cajoled to have this bit of infrastructure included, we were just ignored.\"\n\nCyclist Bek Hawkins said the new shared path was an improvement on riding in traffic, but it had created a new hurdle.\n\nSome cyclists say they prefer to ride on the road to avoid the foot traffic. (ABC Radio Sydney: Aston Brown)\n\n\"You get to the markets [and] everybody is walking around looking at the new building, and you're just on your commute. It creates a clash,\" Ms Hawkins said.\n\n\"It just feels like an accident waiting to happen,\" said Emma Taviani, who also rides past the fish market on her commute.\n\n'The best we could do at the time'\n\nFormer Liberal transport minister Rob Stokes said the project's final design reflected \"very ingrained views\" inside some quarters of government that backed road traffic over pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nMr Stokes said \"two clans\" existed within Transport for NSW.\n\n\"There were those who were very people-focused, then there were those who were almost vehicle-focused,\" he said.\n\n\" I think a lot of the decisions that had gone into the cycle infrastructure around the fish market had been made by the latter group. \"\n\nTransport for NSW opted against a separated cycleway to keep a lane for car traffic. (ABC Radio Sydney: Aston Brown)\n\nMr Stokes also described \"very powerful vested interests\" \u2014 due to a revolving door between government and the private sector \u2014 that prioritised large road and rail projects over active transport infrastructure.\n\nIn response to Mr Stokes's remarks, a Transport for NSW spokesperson said the government recognised Sydney's walking and cycling network as a \"vital part\" of the transport system and said it was committed to its expansion.\n\nA preliminary design of the precinct, seen by ABC Radio Sydney, shows a fully separated cycleway running by the fish market along Bridge Road, with one less traffic lane than there is now.\n\nA planning document shows plans for a potential separated cycleway outside the Sydney Fish Market. (Supplied: City of Sydney)\n\nAs transport minister, Mr Stokes approved the final design but said it \"definitely\" should have included a dedicated cycleway.\n\nHe said the shared path was \"the best we could do at the time\" because the \"early work hadn't been done\".\n\nA NSW government spokesperson did not specify why concept plans for a separated cycleway did not proceed. In a statement, they said the shared path at the fish market was constructed to \"best accommodate\" pedestrians and cyclists of all ages and abilities, and that the government would continue to monitor travel patterns in the area.\n\n\"Given the constrained environment and current demand, there is a need to cater for a wide range of different types of transport users to the fish market as well as through the area,\" they said.\n\n\"This includes pedestrians, bike riders, public transport, coach visitors, as well as motor vehicle traffic, given that Bridge Road is an important access point to ANZAC Bridge and the city.\"\n\nThe new Sydney Fish Market opened on January 19. (ABC News: Monish Nand)\n\nNSW government policy recommends building separated bike lanes in busy areas along \"strategic cycling corridors\" such as this one.\n\nMichael Harrison, a Sydney-based urban designer and planner with more than 40 years of experience, said the final design contradicted this policy and was \"inexplicable\".\n\n\"The excuse might have been that the traffic lanes are needed for traffic \u2014 and they are. But there still would have been space available for a dedicated cycleway due to the deep setback of the building,\" he said.\n\n'It's disjointed and illogical'\n\nMr Stokes said that while the fish market shared path was functioning better than he expected, his biggest frustrations were the \"missing links\" between it and existing cycling infrastructure.\n\nCyclist Bek Hawkins's commute between Glebe and Pyrmont only takes 10 minutes, but she is sometimes shaken up by the time she arrives at work.\n\nBefore passing the fish market, she says she has to negotiate \"several dangerous pinch points\" that require her to suddenly merge in and out of busy footpaths and traffic.\n\nBecause of these clunky connections, many cyclists, including Gemma Bassett, prefer to avoid the shared path altogether and ride on the road.\n\n\"It's disjointed and illogical,\" Ms Bassett said.\n\n\" It's quicker and more convenient to cycle on the road. \"\n\nPeter McLean is the chief executive of the state's peak cycling advocacy group, Bicycle NSW. \"The real shame is it'll cost so much more installing a bike path retrospectively,\" he said.\n\nMcLean said attitudes towards cycling were improving as more cycleway projects were opening across the city.\n\n\"But we have a long way to go before best practice and world-class bicycle infrastructure is rolled out without Bicycle NSW having to pester and harass the government,\" he said.\n\nAnother local cyclist, Ben, who asked for his surname to be withheld, rides past the fish market regularly. \"You ride on the footpath and get in the way of pedestrians, you ride on the road and car drivers get frustrated,\" Ben said.\n\n\"Everyone just gets the shits. It makes us look bad.\"",

Vonn airlifted out\n\nLindsey Vonn was taken to hospital via helicopter after her big crash in the women's downhill at Cortina. (AP: Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nUS skiing superstar Lindsey Vonn was already making headlines this Olympic Games for deciding to compete despite having a completely torn ACL.\n\nAll eyes were on the 41-year-old as she went to make her run in the women's downhill racing, 24 years after her debut in 2002.\n\nBut just 12 seconds in, she had an awful crash.\n\nLindsey Vonn was airlifted off the downhill track after a horrible crash. (Getty Images: PA Images/Andrew Milligan)\n\nIt was a sight no-one wanted to see, and an eerie silence took hold of Cortina d'Ampezzo. She lay on the track for about 10 minutes while being seen by medics until a helicopter came to take her away.\n\nAn official statement from Team USA said Vonn was \"in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians\", undergoing surgery to stabilise a broken left leg.\n\nFans were stunned into silence when Lindsey Vonn crashed 12 seconds in to her downhill racing run.

Coady's nervous wait\n\nAustralian Tess Coady was always in a tricky spot in the women's snowboard big air qualification.\n\nThe 2022 slopestyle bronze medallist was the first rider, meaning she had to watch 28 other women try to better her score, with only the top 12 going through to the final.\n\nOnly the top two scores from the three qualifying runs counted, and Coady added a 75 with her switch backside 900 to a strong 78.50 from her first run, leaving her with a solid but surmountable total of 153.50, and a long wait ahead of her.\n\nA bronze medallist in Beijing, Tess Coady only just scraped through to the final of the women's big air. (Getty Images: Michael Reaves)\n\nBy the time China's Zhang Xiaonan pipped her by a point, Coady was officially bumped down to 12th spot and sitting on the bubble with 11 riders still to come.\n\nThankfully for the 25-year-old, it was the last time her score was bettered, as she managed to progress to the Olympic final for the second straight time, accompanying compatriot Meila Stalker.\n\nThe cameras found a gleeful Coady in the holding pen, and she wiped a bit of faux sweat off her brow as attention turned to the final on Tuesday at 5:30am AEDT.\n\n4. Karl goes topless\n\nIt was a celebration to match the most epic of parallel giant slalom victories.\n\nTrailing for much of the men's final, 40-year-old Benjamin Karl stormed home to defend his gold medal from Beijing and set in motion one of the Winter Olympics' more memorable celebration sequences.\n\nThe roaring veteran wasted no time in removing his top, flexing his muscles and holding the pose with authority.\n\nIt was quite the performance, even before taking into account the sub-zero Italian temperatures he had exposed himself to.\n\nBenjamin Karl roared after removing his top in celebration of his gold medal. (Getty Images: David Ramos)\n\nAnd he wasn't done there.\n\nThe now two-time Olympic champion capped off the display by flinging himself towards the ground, where he lay motionless and face down in the snow.\n\nBenjamin Karl produced a celebration to remember after defending his gold medal.

How to watch the Super Bowl in Italy\n\nWhether it be European football, cricket in India or the Winter Olympics, Australian sport fans are well-accustomed to an interrupted sleep schedule.\n\nBut for American bobsleigh athletes Joshua Williamson and Boone Niederhofer, it seems to be something of a novel idea.\n\nThe bobsleigh program gets underway Thursday night AEDT. (Getty Images: Maddie Meyer)\n\nSpeaking at the Olympic village in Cortina, the pair explained how they planned to watch this morning's Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks, beginning at 12:30am in Italy.\n\n\"My plan is to wake up and watch maybe the second half or the fourth quarter to make sure I'm still doing my job here,\" Williamson said.\n\n\"I'll probably just watch it on my phone in bed, throw it on and make sure I can catch some of it.\"\n\nNiederhofer, who played college football for Texas A&M before becoming an Olympian, said he would be taking a similarly pragmatic approach.\n\nBoone Niederhofer played college football as a receiver for Texas A&M from 2014 to 2016.

(ABC News: Jess Baker)\n\nThe KCC, supported by Kimberley Agricultural Investment, Ord River District Cooperative, and Miriuwung Gajerrong Corporation, was formed in 2021 to lead the construction and operation of the gin.\n\nPreviously, growers had to send their cotton interstate, up to 3,500km, to be processed.\n\nLessons learned\n\nSecond-generation Ord farmer and KCC investor Christian Bloecker said getting the gin off the ground was not easy, but the effort would ultimately pay off.\n\n\"It keeps everything local. The jobs local, the processing and the money that comes from that local,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a way better option than sending cotton by road to Katherine or Queensland like we used to.\"\n\nAlthough 2025 was not Mr Bloecker's first year producing cotton, it was his biggest \u2014 in terms of area \u2014 by more than double.\n\nKimberley growers no longer have to send their cotton interstate to get processed. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\nHe said he learned plenty about the crop and how to grow it well.\n\n\"Definitely the aim for this year is grow shorter cotton,\" Mr Bloecker said.\n\n\"But there's lots of things in terms of nutrition and irrigation, and from a supply chain point of view, how we make things work.\"\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThere was already cotton in the ground at Mr Bloecker's Ord Valley farm this time last year.\n\nHe delayed planting for the 2026 season due to wet weather, and hopes a deferred start might produce a shorter crop.\n\nChristian Bloecker says he is waiting for the rain to subside before planting again. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\nOther growers began planting for the coming season before the final modules from 2025 had been processed through the Kununurra gin.\n\nMr Engelke said Kimberley Agricultural Investment planted its first fields for the season in January.\n\n\"Our anticipated plant area is very similar to last year, which is around about the 4,000-odd hectares,\" he said.\n\n\"For the region, I don't exactly know, but we're expecting somewhere around about 10,000 hectares, possibly a bit more.\"\n\nPrices stagnant\n\nAs producers in the north navigate the formation of their cotton industry, international cotton prices remain subdued.\n\nCotton Australia northern manager Simone Cameron said the price of raw cotton lint was \"not ideal\".\n\n\"Prices have been holding around that mid-$500 per bale price for about 12-18 months,\" she said.\n\n\"Historically, it sits at around $600.\"\n\nLast season, Australia produced about 5.4 million bales of cotton, collectively worth about $3.7 billion. (ABC News: Kelsey Reid)\n\nMs Cameron said the cotton industry was up against the synthetic fibre industry, which was \"very good\" at marketing itself as cleaner and greener than natural fibres.\n\n\"We do have some work to do there to help really drive that natural fibres are much better for the planet than a synthetic fibre,\" she said.\n\nThe decline of global cotton prices over the past year has impacted the profitability of the crop, but Mr Bloecker said it was still viable in the Kimberley.\n\n\"That's the thing about selling it on the world market, there are going to be these cycles where the price is lower,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd love the price to be higher, but even at $500 a bale, an industry can grow off that.\"\n\nWyndham port gateway to the world\n\nMeanwhile, growers in the Ord eagerly await the Port of Wyndham, located 100 kilometres north-west of Kununurra, gaining First Point of Entry (FPOE) status.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese granted FPOE status last year, but the change will not come into effect until the port has the infrastructure to manage biosecurity threats.\n\nThe Kimberley Cotton Gin has the capacity to process more than 100,000 bales annually. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nThe first shipment of locally grown cotton was exported from Wyndham in October, consisting of about 60 containers, each carrying about 104 bales of cotton.\n\nHaving FPOE status will allow the port to receive empty containers for immediate export and enable direct international shipping for the Kimberley cotton industry.",

    "text": "As communities along the NSW South Coast continue to deal with the scars of Black Summer six years on, the smell and sight of smoke this summer brought back painful memories.\n\nResidents on the NSW far south coast said they felt triggered when heatwave conditions led to a bushfire starting in the Wadbilliga National Park, 20 kilometres north-west of Cobargo, last month.\n\nIn December 2019, Cobargo's main street was gutted by a fire that became linked to the deaths of seven people.\n\nThe Wadbilliga fire was not extinguished until last week.\n\nWith the devastation of the 2019-20 fires \u2014 which claimed close to 1,000 homes and more than 1.5 million hectares in the region \u2014 still fresh, it has made many in its vicinity take stock of how prepared they are for the next big fire season.\n\nA bushfire started in January in the Wadbilliga National Park, but was eventually brought under control by the RFS. (Supplied: NSW RFS)\n\nTelecommunications lifeline\n\nIn the remote Deua River Valley, south-west of Batemans Bay and to the north of the Wadbillinga NP, Clay Stafford gets emotional when recalling Black Summer.\n\nHe remembers being out with the Rural Fire Service (RFS) when his community's lifeline to the outside world \u2014 a telecommunications tower \u2014 went down.\n\n\"We had got used to updates from the fire app, and we'd also gotten used to looking at ABC News to see what was going on,\" Mr Stafford said.\n\n\"All that just ceased in one day, it just stopped.\"\n\nOn December 31, 2019, the Mount Wandera telecommunications tower was destroyed.\n\nThe access road to the Mount Wandera transmitter after the Currowan fire went through in January 2020. (Supplied: Clay Stafford)\n\nExtreme heat from the fire melted cables and infrastructure and knocked out critical services including mobile phone and internet coverage, radio and television transmission and emergency communications.\n\nIt took five months for mobile phone reception to return in the valley, compounding the challenge of fighting the fires.\n\n\"It did make us go back to basics. We got our old CB radios just to communicate with other people in the RFS,\" Mr Stafford said.\n\nThe Mount Wandera transmitter is vital for internet, mobile and emergency communication, as well as radio and television across the NSW South Coast. (ABC South East NSW: Toby Hemmings)\n\nWhile the tower was rebuilt in October 2020, the Eurobodalla Shire Council received federal government funding in 2023 to improve the resilience of its site.\n\nBut Mr Stafford said he was concerned about the lack of preparation in the lead up to summer, with access roads only cleared in the past few weeks.\n\nIn the middle of heatwaves and conditions reminiscent of Black Summer last month, Mr Stafford said he had been worried whether the site would be resilient enough to survive the next blaze.\n\n\" For us, having seen it burn, it's a big issue. \"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Eurobodalla Shire Council said advice received from the NSW RFS was that clearing around the tower would offer limited bushfire protection.\n\n\"To improve access to the telecommunications site, dangerous or high-risk trees and vegetation along Knowles and Wandera Trig Road are being removed,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Due to restrictions to crown land approvals, ongoing maintenance costs and NSW RFS advice that clearing would offer limited bushfire protection, Council is instead focusing on improving access and strengthening the site itself.\n\n\"This includes installing fireproof lagging on the cables and replacing the existing chain-mesh fencing with Colorbond fencing.\"\n\nCouncil said works would be completed later this year.\n\nThe Cobargo Historic Village sign was destroyed during the January 2020 bushfires. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nA gradual rebuild\n\nOne hundred kilometres further south, and to the east of the Wadbillinga NP fire, the town of Cobargo is still trying to regain what was lost during Black Summer.\n\nThe main street of Cobargo was destroyed by fire during the January 2020 bushfires. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nIn the aftermath of the destruction of many of the buildings in the main street, a group of volunteers set up the Cobargo Community Development Corporation (CCDC) to help the reconstruction of the town.\n\nLoading...\n\nCCDC chairperson John Walters said without rebuilding the main street in a timely and coordinated fashion, Cobargo's future looked bleak.\n\n\"We faced relegation to being just a forgotten little whistle stop on the highway,\" he said.\n\nJohn Walters heads the Cobargo Community Development Corportation, which was set up by volunteers. (ABC South East NSW: Vanessa Milton)\n\nUsing funding from the Bushfire Local Economy Recovery Fund (BLERF), co-funded by the federal and state governments, the CCDC has so far managed the construction of a new post office, village square and market hall.\n\nMr Walters believes it is the only BLERF project to receive funding to rebuild commercial infrastructure.\n\n\"To do that, we had to take the land out of private ownership and transfer it to community ownership as a not-for profit,\" he said.\n\nMr Walters said the projects have faced up to 18 months worth of external delays, but they now aim to be finished by March.\n\nIt is a similar story for the new Cobargo Bushfire Resilience Centre on the main street.\n\nThe Cobargo Bushfire Resilience Centre will honour the people who lost their lives during the Black Summer bushfires. (ABC South East: Jacinta Counihan)\n\nThe centre aims to be a space for commemoration for the people who lost their lives in Black Summer, plus a place to hold events, exhibitions and education programs.\n\nThe building is complete, but the open date is unknown due to bureaucratic complications with neighbouring construction.\n\nRhonda Ayliffe, whose family donated the land for the centre, said the bushfire in Wadbilliga NP last month was a reminder of how far the recovery still has to go.\n\nRhonda Ayliffe led the creation of the Cobargo Bushfire Resilience Centre on a site her family had owned for generations. (ABC South East NSW: Vanessa Milton)\n\n\"When you have a fire in the same spot where one was before, people think, 'Gosh, we haven't even recovered, we haven't even got the main street back operating again'.\"\n\nMore than bricks and mortar\n\nDespite the setbacks, Ms Ayliffe said the small close-knit communities along the South Coast know that recovery and resilience is more than rebuilding physical structures.\n\n\"Our idea of resilience was not just bouncing back, it's bouncing forward,\" she said.\n\nJason Miles and his family moved to Cobargo after Black Summer. (ABC South East NSW: Vanessa Milton)\n\nJason Miles and his family moved to Cobargo in the aftermath of Black Summer and renovated the historic Cobargo bank building as a cafe.\n\nHe said his family had been embraced by the community in the continuing journey of recovery.\n\nThe rebuild of Cobargo's main street is close to completion. (ABC South East NSW: Vanessa Milton)\n\n\"There's still ones in the community who will never get back what they've lost,\" Mr Miles said.\n\n\"But the general hope of the area, that underlying positivity for the future, it's risen.\"",

The statement released on Sunday evening claims the ABC has relied in part on an \u201cunreliable and disgruntled\u201d source who had misidentified one of the alleged gunmen, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, and confused some of his actions before the attack with things done by someone else. ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess last week. Alex Ellinghausen The ABC is standing by the story, which it said used extensive reporting and numerous sources to examine the Akrams\u2019 actions leading up to the attack. ASIO, which has not seen the program, said its ability to respond to Four Corners\u2032 questions was constrained as it did not want to risk prejudicing the royal commission into antisemitism and the ongoing criminal investigation against Akram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkram has been charged with murdering 15 people in the December 14 attack, in which his father and alleged co-conspirator Sajid Akram was shot dead by police. The first of two parts of Four Corners\u2032 investigation was led by reporter Mark Willacy, airing last week. It provided an account of the events of the day of the attack, told by those present. The second part, led by reporter Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop, will investigate \u201cthe secret lives of the terrorists, uncovering astonishing new information about the years leading up to the attack\u201d, according to the ABC. The ABC will on Monday night air the second part of a Four Corners investigation into the Bondi terror attack. Christopher Pearce ASIO\u2019s statement, made in response to unknown ABC questions and released publicly in an unusual pre-emptive move, notes that the domestic intelligence agency investigated Naveed Akram in 2019 using its \u201cmost sensitive capabilities.\u201d \u201cWe assessed he did not adhere to or intend to engage in violent extremism at that time. Having reviewed all available intelligence, we stand by our assessment at that point in time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFour Corners\u2019 claims contain significant errors of fact.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASIO said \u201cif the ABC chooses to publish claims it cannot substantiate [...] we will reserve our right to take further action.\u201d Related Article Live\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict Herzog visit LIVE updates: Israeli president lays wreath at Bondi Pavilion; protesters launch last-minute challenge to \u2018extraordinary\u2019 police powers The Bondi royal commission is required to complete its first report by April. It will examine, among other things, whether Australia\u2019s intelligence and law enforcement services were as effective as they could have been in stopping the attack, how they co-operated and whether they were hampered by legal rules. ASIO said an ABC source had a track record of making statements that are untrue. The agency rejected previously reported claims that Naveed Akram is a close associate of terrorists. \u201cThe claims Four Corners is making were investigated at the time and found to be unsubstantiated,\u201d ASIO said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ABC\u2019s source mis-identified Naveed Akram. That is, the source claimed Naveed Akram said and did things that were actually said and done by an entirely different person. To be clear, Four Corners\u2032 source mis-identified Naveed Akram, and therefore the associated claims are untrue.\u201d Related Article Bondi shooting A father, a son and the radical world of terror An ABC spokesperson defended the program as a comprehensive investigation examining the events leading up to the worst terrorist attack on Australian soil. \u201cFour Corners spoke to numerous people and provides a number of sources of information for a detailed picture of the Akrams\u2019 actions and associations in the years leading up to the Bondi attack,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDetailed questions were put to ASIO and its response is reflected in the story.

Got it Share A A A\n\nGateway Mining has added another attractive piece to its growing Yandal gold puzzle, unveiling shallow gold mineralisation at a newly defined prospect known as Hummer, just west of the company\u2019s Haflinger discovery in Western Australia. The early results have come from wide-spaced aircore drilling targeting a structural splay off the regionally significant Celia Shear Zone - the same fertile architecture that underpins much of the company\u2019s gold endowment across its Horse Well gold camp. Drilling rig at Gateway Mining\u2019s Yandal gold project in Western Australia. Gateway\u2019s first pass has already delivered oxide gold intercepts, highlighted by 16 metres at 1.0 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 64m, featuring a higher-grade 4-metre thick domain running at 2.7g/t gold. Notably, those shallow oxide hits came from just two drill lines spaced 400 metres apart. The extent of the mineralisation bears strong similarities to the northernmost aircore intercepts at Gateway\u2019s nearby Haflinger discovery, suggesting the company may be sitting on the fringes of a much larger mineralised system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Our systematic approach to exploration through the Celia-Mustang area is continuing to yield very significant results.\u2019 Gateway Mining executive chairman Andrew Bray Historical drilling in the area barely scratched the surface, with most holes stopping in the depletion zone and never reaching the key shear-hosted targets now being unlocked by Gateway\u2019s more systematic approach. Within the Yandal camp, stacked mineralised gold veins tend to develop along sheared contacts between intermediate volcanics, mafic volcanic units and intrusive margins. This is a classic signature for Yilgarn-style shear-hosted gold systems, with the same geological architecture seemingly present at Hummer. Data modelling shows that Hummer sits on a flexed segment of a splay structure branching from the main Celia Shear Zone. The flexure is critical as it creates dilation zones that act as pressure-release valves for gold-bearing fluids. Significantly, around 4km of strike length remains untested. Magnetic imagery shows stronger structural bending further south, where a northeast-trending fault offsets the splay structure. Gateway believes this area could host enhanced dilation and potentially higher-grade gold as drilling steps out along strike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has already added 52 additional aircore holes to its ongoing two-rig drilling campaign to infill and extend the Hummer footprint north and south. Notably, no drilling to date has intersected the target shear zone in fresh rock, leaving plenty of blue-sky upside once deeper and more focused drilling begins. Gateway Mining executive chairman Andrew Bray said: \u201cOur systematic approach to exploration through the Celia-Mustang area is continuing to yield very significant results, and we look forward to discovering further major zones of gold mineralisation as drilling continues southwards through the broader project area.\u201d Gateway\u2019s Yandal project lies 85 kilometres northeast of Wiluna and spans a vast 1,780 square kilometre patch on the eastern flank of the world-class Yandal Greenstone Belt. This belt is one of Australia\u2019s most prolific gold-producing regions and home to Northern Star Resources\u2019 nearby Jundee mine. Jundee has been a cornerstone operation in the region since mining began 30 years ago, producing gold from both underground and open-pit operations. Its success has long underlined the prospectivity of the Yandal Greenstone Belt, particularly for Archaean, high-grade, narrow-vein lode-style deposits. Gateway\u2019s broader Yandal project already hosts an inventory of 8.17 million tonnes at 1.52 grams per tonne gold for 400,400 ounces. The resource is centred on the Horse Well Gold Camp and the Dusk \u2019til Dawn deposit and provides a solid foundation for ongoing exploration success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s growth push at Yandal is backed by a strong balance sheet, with $19.4 million in cash and a further $9.3 million in liquid ASX-listed securities as at the end of the December quarter. Gateway says that firepower gives it ample runway to aggressively test multiple targets across the broader Celia\u2013Mustang trend this year. With gold prices hovering near record highs and majors increasingly hungry for quality ounces in safe jurisdictions, Gateway\u2019s emerging discoveries near Haflinger are shaping up as more than just geological curiosities. If Hummer continues to deliver as drilling tightens up, the company may well be on its way to defining the next meaningful gold system in the Yandal belt.

    "text": "Michael Dickson has gone from being an aspiring Australian rules footballer to becoming the highest-paid punter in the NFL, and now vying for victory in today's Super Bowl.\n\nSydney-born Dickson was overlooked in the 2014 AFL draft when he was 18. From that point on, he was set on a different kind of football journey.\n\nNow he is lining up for the Seattle Seahawks against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 60 in California today.\n\nIf his team wins, he'll become just the second Australian to play in a Super Bowl and win and the third Australian to win a Super Bowl overall.\n\nSydney's Jordan Mailata won last year playing for the Philadelphia Eagles, while in 2014, Jesse Williams became the first Australian to win a Super Bowl when his Seattle Seahawks team won the title. Williams did not play in the game because of injury but was still awarded the winner's ring.\n\nREAD MORE From SoundCloud to the Super Bowl \u2014 Bad Bunny set to make halftime history\n\nIn 2015, Dickson moved from Sydney to Melbourne to trial a program called Prokick, where Australians receive coaching to launch into American football. He was soon scouted as a punter by the University of Texas.\n\nThe punter position in football receives the snapped ball directly from the line of scrimmage, and then kicks the football to the opposing team.\n\nOutstanding performances for the University of Texas Longhorns team led to him being drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in 2018.\n\nWhen did Dickson make his NFL debut?\n\nDickson made his debut during the season opener against the Denver Broncos. By week 8, he made an unconventional game-winning move against the Detroit Lions, when he ran the ball, an unusual move for a punter. Dickson's bold move was labelled \"the Aussie sweep.\"\n\nAlthough Dickson had defied his instructions, then-coach Pete Caroll said: \"That's going to be my favourite play for a while.\"\n\nIn 2021, Dickson punted the ball 83 times for 3,895 yards during the 2021 season, an average of 46.9 yards per punt \u2014 a career high. That same year, he made 40 punts inside the opponents' 20-yard line, the most in the league that season, and the 10th most in a single season in NFL history.\n\nLast year, Dickson signed a four-year contract extension with the Seahawks for US$16.2 million ($23.1 million) \u2014 making him the highest-paid punter in the NFL's history.\n\nOne of the Seattle Seahawks' biggest stars, Michael Dickson, was overlooked by the AFL. Source: AP / Brynn Anderson\n\nThe 2026 Super Bowl marks a career high for Dickson, where he's playing for the first time.\n\nThe Super Bowl is America's most-viewed television broadcast. A record 127.7 million Americans tuned in to watch the 2025 game, eclipsing the estimated 123 million viewership a year earlier.\n\nWhen is the Super Bowl and how can I watch in Australia?\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks will be playing against the New England Patriots. The two teams competed at the 2015 Super Bowl, where the Patriots won.\n\nThe Patriots have won six Super Bowl titles, in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, and 2019. The Seahawks won in 2014 against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Super Bowl will screen in the US on Sunday at 3.30pm local time, which is Monday morning in Australia.\n\nThe game will be at 10.30am on Monday in NSW, the ACT, Victoria, and Tasmania, 10am in South Australia, 9.30am in Queensland and 7.30am in Western Australia.\n\nThe 2026 Super Bowl will be available to watch free-to-air on Channel 7, and online at 7plus.\n\nIt will be broadcast on Disney+, Foxtel's ESPN channel, and KAYO.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

    "text": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is savouring a likely election triumph, with her ruling coalition projected to have won a two-thirds majority in the powerful lower house.\n\nIf confirmed by official results, the outcome gives Japan's first female premier a strong mandate to implement her conservative agenda and stamp her mark on the country of 123 million people over the next four years.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region will be watching closely however to see if Takaichi, 64, ups the ante or lowers the temperature with China after enraging Beijing in November with comments about Taiwan.\n\nFinancial markets may also be nervous about Japan's public finances and its gargantuan debt pile if Takaichi decides to cut taxes and boost spending in Asia's number-two economy.\n\nREAD MORE Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi dissolves parliament after three months in office\n\n\"We have consistently stressed the importance of responsible and proactive fiscal policy,\" Takaichi insisted late Sunday.\n\n\"We will prioritise the sustainability of fiscal policy. We will ensure necessary investments. Public and private sectors must invest. We will build a strong and resilient economy,\" she said.\n\nHit with young voters\n\nCapitalising on her honeymoon start after becoming Japan's fifth premier in as many years in October, Takaichi called the snap election last month.\n\nThe gamble paid off handsomely, with local media projecting late Sunday that her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won around 300 seats of the 465 contested.\n\nTogether with its junior coalition partner, the ruling bloc was expected to have garnered at least the 310 seats needed for a two-thirds majority.\n\nTakaichi has injected new life into the LDP, which has governed Japan almost non-stop for decades but which has shed support in recent elections because of unhappiness about rising prices and corruption.\n\nA heavy metal drummer in her youth, Takaichi was an admirer of Britain's \"Iron Lady\" Margaret Thatcher, and on the ultra-conservative fringe of the LDP when she became party chief.\n\nShe has been a hit with voters, especially young ones, with fans lapping up everything from her handbag to her jamming to a K-pop song with South Korea's president.\n\nBut she will have to deliver on the economy to remain popular.\n\n\"With prices rising like this, what matters most to me is what policies they'll adopt to deal with inflation,\" voter Chika Sakamoto, 50, told AFP at a voting station in snowy Tokyo on Sunday.\n\nRelationship with China\n\nBefore becoming prime minister, Takaichi was seen as a China hawk.\n\nShe was a regular visitor to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honours convicted war criminals along with 2.5 million war dead and is seen as a symbol of Japan's militarist past.\n\nBarely two weeks in office, Takaichi suggested that Japan could intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take self-ruled Taiwan by force.\n\nChina regards the democratic island as part of its territory and has not ruled out force to annex it.\n\nWith Takaichi having days earlier pulled out all the stops to welcome US President Donald Trump, Beijing was furious with her unscripted remarks. It summoned Tokyo's ambassador, warned its citizens against visiting Japan and conducted joint air drills with Russia.\n\nMargarita Estevez-Abe, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said that Takaichi can afford to dial down tensions now.\n\n\"Now she doesn't have to worry about any elections until 2028, when the next upper house elections will take place,\" Estevez-Abe told AFP before the vote.\n\n\"So the best scenario for Japan is that Takaichi kind of takes a deep breath and focuses on amending the relationship with China.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

We had less than five hours to determine whether we wanted to vote for this bill or not, and I don't think that's good legislating. So we've been consistent all the way, we're back to with integrity and respect, and we'll continue to have those discussions with the Liberal Party, but I hope that in the near future, that there is a coalition because that's the only way to bring Anthony Albanese down.\"\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump's so-called \"Board of Peace\" will meet for the first time in two weeks.\n\nThe first meeting is scheduled for 19 February and will reportedly also serve as a fundraising conference for the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nMany rights experts say that Mr Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's affairs resembled a colonial structure, and they criticised the board for not including a Palestinian.\n\nSecretary-general of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, says he's hopeful that Palestinians can govern themselves.\n\n\"I hope for a continuous rebuilding of the cities that have been demolished and destroyed beyond recognition, and I hope that the Palestinian Authority would be allowed to emerge back in Gaza, aiming at the establishment of a Palestinian state ruled by the Palestinians themselves.\"\n\nPolling has opened in Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is hopeful the election will allow her to push new conservative policies.\n\nPolls predict the election will hand Ms Takaichi's ruling coalition a resounding win, though record snowfall in parts of the country could keep many voters at home.\n\nOpinion polls suggest the conservative coalition, led by Japan's first female prime minister, could win more than 300 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Parliament.\n\nAhead of the vote, some residents say they fear the direction Japan is heading.\n\n\u201cI feel Japan may have drifted too far to the right. I also want Japan to be protected, but things seem to be moving towards an extreme direction, that scares me.\"\n\nSnowboarder Valentino Guseli has fallen short in his unexpected bid for Australia\u2019s first medal at the Winter Olympics in Italy.\n\nThe 20-year-old reached the final of the men\u2019s big air event \u2014 a single jump off a huge ramp \u2014 but couldn\u2019t land two of his jumps, finishing 10th.\n\nJapan\u2019s Kira Kimura claimed gold ahead of compatriot Ryoma Kimata, with China\u2019s defending champion Su Yiming taking bronze.\n\nIn other results, Alex Ferlazzo sits 20th after the first round of the men\u2019s luge, while Rosie Fordham was Australia\u2019s best in the women\u2019s skiathlon, finishing 49th.",

We are stronger. Differences have been resolved,\" she said.\n\n\"We're squarely focused on representing the Australian people and fighting for their needs, their aspirations and their hopes. They deserve no less. They expect no less. And they will receive no less.\"\n\nWhen asked during the press conference about reports Littleproud had asked for Ley's resignation, and whether they trusted each other, the duo said they did.\n\nLey said: \"Yes, 100 per cent, I trust David and I value and respect the National Party as one of the two great parties.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be standing here today if I didn't trust Susan, if I didn't trust the Liberal Party,\" Littleproud said.\n\n\"So I'm very comfortable and we've said to one another, this is where we can look each other in the eye and say, this is the team that will go to the next election.\"\n\nLittleproud and deputy Nationals leader Kevin Hogan will immediately rejoin leadership meetings and shadow cabinet processes.\n\nThe leaders also signed an agreement codifying the convention of shadow cabinet solidarity, in which frontbenchers must step down from their roles if they vote against an agreed position of the Liberal-National joint party room.\n\nThe written agreement clearly sets out that the joint party room has primacy over the individual National and Liberal party rooms, addressing the contradiction that instigated the split.\n\nLISTEN TO What is behind the surge in support for Pauline Hanson and One Nation? SBS News 05:38 English\n\nThree Nationals frontbenchers \u2014 Ross Cadell, Bridget McKenzie and Susan McDonald \u2014 voted against Labor's hate speech laws, in line with a party decision but in defiance of an agreed shadow cabinet position.\n\nThe trio later tendered their resignations to Ley, which she accepted.\n\nBut the move triggered a furious response from Littleproud and the Nationals, who resigned from shadow cabinet en masse and caused the Coalition's collapse.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference on Sunday, Littleproud said the fall-out was \"disappointing\".\n\n\"The Coalition isn't one party, but we're two parties and we've been able to work together. But when it matters, we've got to be able to say to the Australian people what we stand for.\n\n\"And that's the maturity and leadership that I thank Susan for, that we've been able to say we've got to find a better way forward.\"\n\nThe reunification comes during a seismic shift in Australia's right-wing political landscape, with minor-party One Nation surging past the former Coalition partners in some polls.\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

And that could be a nasty pneumonia, for example, or could be brain inflammation and swelling that can lead to death or permanent disability,\" he said.\n\nHe also highlighted the extreme contagiousness of the disease.\n\n\"It's so infectious that you can be in an exposure site after someone with measles was there, even up to a few hours afterwards, and still get infected.\n\n\"It's one of these infections that can travel through air conditioning circuits, and we can see people be infected in other rooms if they're on the same circuit ... So it's spread very easily via the airborne route.\"\n\nChair of child and young person's health at the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Dr Tim Jones agreed, telling SBS News: \"It spreads like wildfire. It's orders of magnitude more contagious than COVID was.\"\n\nUp to nine out of 10 people who don't have immunity will become infected after exposure to an infected person, according to the CDC.\n\nVaccine hesitancy and misinformation\n\nThe CDC also advises that two measles vaccinations are 99 per cent effective at preventing measles infection.\n\nHowever, Australian vaccination rates, particularly among children, have decreased in recent years.\n\nAccording to recent Department of Health data, around 93 per cent of five-year-olds have had all vaccines recommended for their age, while around 89.5 per cent of two-year-olds are fully vaccinated.\n\nThe department warned that, over the last three years, the nation's vaccination rate has dropped below its aspirational target of 95 per cent, which it says is needed to reach the \"herd immunity\" required to stop the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.\n\nThe Australian Medical Association issued a call in December last year for \"immediate action to combat vaccine hesitancy and reverse declining immunisation rates across the country\". Source: Getty / Halfpoint Images\n\nBoth experts interviewed by SBS News pointed to vaccine hesitation as driving the increased spread of measles, with Griffin saying it was \"getting harder to convince people to make the right decision and get the vaccine\".\n\nJones said the years of COVID-19 restrictions and mandates had induced a hesitation about vaccination in some Australians.\n\n\"Families are just burnt out after COVID. They were tired of the constantly changing advice that was given on vaccination. So they're sceptical about whether the [measles] vaccination truly is as important as we say it is.\"\n\nJones said that, in his experience as a doctor, sitting down with families and discussing the risks associated with the disease changed most people's minds.\n\n\"What I find I need to do as a clinician for those families is to put what was happening in COVID in context \u2014 that things were changing very, very quickly \u2014 versus something like measles, where it's a disease that's been around for a very long time.\n\n\"We know it very well, and the vaccinations that we've been using have also been around for a long time, and we know what they are.\"\n\nMajor outbreak to elimination to a tripling of cases\n\nIn 1994, Australia faced a major measles outbreak with 4,794 confirmed cases. It was that year that the two-dose vaccination schedule was introduced for children aged between 10 and 16 years old.\n\nAt first, vaccination rates were low, but by 2000 they were sufficient to reduce the circulation of the virus, according to the Communicable Diseases Network Australia.\n\nThe two-dose vaccine offers 99 per cent protection against illness and serious complications, according to the CDC\n\nMeasles often comes with flu-like symptoms \u2014 such as a fever and runny nose \u2014 but it's important to also look out for a rash, cough and conjunctivitis, which are tell-tale signs of measles.\n\nThe National Immunisation Program now includes two doses of the measles vaccine for children aged 12 and 18 months. Source: AAP\n\nSince 1994, most Australians have received their vaccination as part of the National Immunisation Program (NIP).\n\nIn 2014, measles was declared eliminated in Australia by WHO due to the endemic measle strain not circulating for several years \u2014 thanks to the effectiveness of the vaccine.\n\nHowever, cases continue to occur in Australia, mostly in those who have travelled overseas.\n\n\"What we need to recognise is that what's kept those numbers down is consistently keeping the measles vaccination rate in Australia over 95 per cent of our population. And that's a number that's been steadily slipping over the last few years,\" Jones said.\n\n\"We've seen a tripling of measles cases in Australia over the last year ... I do think there needs to be some, at least a mild degree of, concern about what's going on.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nASIO has issued a rare public statement declaring it holds \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the accuracy of an ABC investigation into the Bondi massacre set to air on Four Corners on Monday night and warning of further action if false claims are broadcast. The statement released on Sunday evening claims the ABC has relied in part on an \u201cunreliable and disgruntled\u201d source who had misidentified one of the alleged gunmen, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, and confused some of his actions before the attack with things done by someone else. ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess last week. Alex Ellinghausen The ABC is standing by the story, which it said used extensive reporting and numerous sources to examine the Akrams\u2019 actions leading up to the attack. ASIO, which has not seen the program, said its ability to respond to Four Corners\u2032 questions was constrained as it did not want to risk prejudicing the royal commission into antisemitism and the ongoing criminal investigation against Akram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkram has been charged with murdering 15 people in the December 14 attack, in which his father and alleged co-conspirator Sajid Akram was shot dead by police. The first of two parts of Four Corners\u2032 investigation was led by reporter Mark Willacy, airing last week. It provided an account of the events of the day of the attack, told by those present. The second part, led by reporter Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop, will investigate \u201cthe secret lives of the terrorists, uncovering astonishing new information about the years leading up to the attack\u201d, according to the ABC. The ABC will on Monday night air the second part of a Four Corners investigation into the Bondi terror attack. Christopher Pearce ASIO\u2019s statement, made in response to unknown ABC questions and released publicly in an unusual pre-emptive move, notes that the domestic intelligence agency investigated Naveed Akram in 2019 using its \u201cmost sensitive capabilities.\u201d \u201cWe assessed he did not adhere to or intend to engage in violent extremism at that time. Having reviewed all available intelligence, we stand by our assessment at that point in time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFour Corners\u2019 claims contain significant errors of fact.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASIO said \u201cif the ABC chooses to publish claims it cannot substantiate [...] we will reserve our right to take further action.\u201d Related Article Live\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict Herzog visit LIVE updates: Israeli president lays wreath at Bondi Pavilion; protesters launch last-minute challenge to \u2018extraordinary\u2019 police powers The Bondi royal commission is required to complete its first report by April. It will examine, among other things, whether Australia\u2019s intelligence and law enforcement services were as effective as they could have been in stopping the attack, how they co-operated and whether they were hampered by legal rules. ASIO said an ABC source had a track record of making statements that are untrue. The agency rejected previously reported claims that Naveed Akram is a close associate of terrorists. \u201cThe claims Four Corners is making were investigated at the time and found to be unsubstantiated,\u201d ASIO said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ABC\u2019s source mis-identified Naveed Akram. That is, the source claimed Naveed Akram said and did things that were actually said and done by an entirely different person. To be clear, Four Corners\u2032 source mis-identified Naveed Akram, and therefore the associated claims are untrue.\u201d Related Article Bondi shooting A father, a son and the radical world of terror An ABC spokesperson defended the program as a comprehensive investigation examining the events leading up to the worst terrorist attack on Australian soil. \u201cFour Corners spoke to numerous people and provides a number of sources of information for a detailed picture of the Akrams\u2019 actions and associations in the years leading up to the Bondi attack,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDetailed questions were put to ASIO and its response is reflected in the story.

Related Article ABC More Insight than Q+A: David Speers to host ABC\u2019s new town hall show ASIO also rejected expected ABC accusations of understaffing and suggestions that redundancies at the intelligence agency in 2020 might have contributed in some way to its ability to prevent the massacre. \u201cThe claim any resourcing decision increased the likelihood of the Bondi attack is false, irresponsible and demonstrates profound ignorance of ASIO\u2019s prioritisation frameworks and enduring investment in counterterrorism,\u201d ASIO said. \u201cTragically, ASIO did not know what the perpetrators of the Bondi attack were planning \u2013 or indeed that they were planning anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASIO said given the questions the ABC asked and that reporter Rubinsztein-Dunlop had \u201cpreviously broadcast false claims about ASIO and the Akrams\u201d, it held \u201cgrave concerns about the accuracy of the proposed story\u201d.

Got it Share A A A\n\nGateway Mining has added another attractive piece to its growing Yandal gold puzzle, unveiling shallow gold mineralisation at a newly defined prospect known as Hummer, just west of the company\u2019s Haflinger discovery in Western Australia. The early results have come from wide-spaced aircore drilling targeting a structural splay off the regionally significant Celia Shear Zone - the same fertile architecture that underpins much of the company\u2019s gold endowment across its Horse Well gold camp. Drilling rig at Gateway Mining\u2019s Yandal gold project in Western Australia. Gateway\u2019s first pass has already delivered oxide gold intercepts, highlighted by 16 metres at 1.0 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 64m, featuring a higher-grade 4-metre thick domain running at 2.7g/t gold. Notably, those shallow oxide hits came from just two drill lines spaced 400 metres apart. The extent of the mineralisation bears strong similarities to the northernmost aircore intercepts at Gateway\u2019s nearby Haflinger discovery, suggesting the company may be sitting on the fringes of a much larger mineralised system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Our systematic approach to exploration through the Celia-Mustang area is continuing to yield very significant results.\u2019 Gateway Mining executive chairman Andrew Bray Historical drilling in the area barely scratched the surface, with most holes stopping in the depletion zone and never reaching the key shear-hosted targets now being unlocked by Gateway\u2019s more systematic approach. Within the Yandal camp, stacked mineralised gold veins tend to develop along sheared contacts between intermediate volcanics, mafic volcanic units and intrusive margins. This is a classic signature for Yilgarn-style shear-hosted gold systems, with the same geological architecture seemingly present at Hummer. Data modelling shows that Hummer sits on a flexed segment of a splay structure branching from the main Celia Shear Zone. The flexure is critical as it creates dilation zones that act as pressure-release valves for gold-bearing fluids. Significantly, around 4km of strike length remains untested. Magnetic imagery shows stronger structural bending further south, where a northeast-trending fault offsets the splay structure. Gateway believes this area could host enhanced dilation and potentially higher-grade gold as drilling steps out along strike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has already added 52 additional aircore holes to its ongoing two-rig drilling campaign to infill and extend the Hummer footprint north and south. Notably, no drilling to date has intersected the target shear zone in fresh rock, leaving plenty of blue-sky upside once deeper and more focused drilling begins. Gateway Mining executive chairman Andrew Bray said: \u201cOur systematic approach to exploration through the Celia-Mustang area is continuing to yield very significant results, and we look forward to discovering further major zones of gold mineralisation as drilling continues southwards through the broader project area.\u201d Gateway\u2019s Yandal project lies 85 kilometres northeast of Wiluna and spans a vast 1,780 square kilometre patch on the eastern flank of the world-class Yandal Greenstone Belt. This belt is one of Australia\u2019s most prolific gold-producing regions and home to Northern Star Resources\u2019 nearby Jundee mine. Jundee has been a cornerstone operation in the region since mining began 30 years ago, producing gold from both underground and open-pit operations. Its success has long underlined the prospectivity of the Yandal Greenstone Belt, particularly for Archaean, high-grade, narrow-vein lode-style deposits. Gateway\u2019s broader Yandal project already hosts an inventory of 8.17 million tonnes at 1.52 grams per tonne gold for 400,400 ounces. The resource is centred on the Horse Well Gold Camp and the Dusk \u2019til Dawn deposit and provides a solid foundation for ongoing exploration success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s growth push at Yandal is backed by a strong balance sheet, with $19.4 million in cash and a further $9.3 million in liquid ASX-listed securities as at the end of the December quarter. Gateway says that firepower gives it ample runway to aggressively test multiple targets across the broader Celia\u2013Mustang trend this year. With gold prices hovering near record highs and majors increasingly hungry for quality ounces in safe jurisdictions, Gateway\u2019s emerging discoveries near Haflinger are shaping up as more than just geological curiosities. If Hummer continues to deliver as drilling tightens up, the company may well be on its way to defining the next meaningful gold system in the Yandal belt.
