    "text": "US President Donald Trump has unveiled a drug price overhaul he claims will force other countries, including Australia , to pay more in order to reduce prices for Americans.\n\nHe signed a sweeping executive order setting a 30-day deadline for drugmakers to electively lower the cost of prescription drugs in the US or face new limits down the road over what the US government would pay.\n\nThe order calls on the health department, led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, to broker new price tags for drugs over the next month.\n\nUS President Donald Trump signs an executive order related to drug prices, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, May 12, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nIf deals are not reached, Kennedy will be tasked with developing a new rule that ties the price the US pays for medications to lower prices paid by other countries.\n\n\"We're going to equalise,\" Trump said during a Monday morning (early Tuesday AEST) press conference.\n\n\"We're all going to pay the same. We're going to pay what Europe pays.\"\n\nThe European Union was undoubtedly the president's main target but he also called out price differences between the UK and Australia.\n\n\"Whoever is paying the lowest price, we will look at that price when we will say that's the price we're going to pay. Most favoured nation is what it is,\" Trump said.\n\n\"One breast cancer drug costs Americans over $16,000 per bottle, but the same drug from the same factory, manufactured by the same company, is one-sixth that price in Australia and one-tenth that price in Sweden. One-tenth for the identical product.\n\nIf deals are not reached, Kennedy will be tasked with developing a new rule that ties the price the US pays for medications to lower prices paid by other countries. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\n\"A common asthma drug costs almost $500 here in America, but costs less than $40 in the United Kingdom.\"\n\nIt's unclear what \u2014 if any \u2014 impact the Republican president's executive order will have on millions of Americans who have private health insurance. The federal government has the most power to shape the price it pays for drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThe impact on prices in Australia and other countries is even less clear but Trump insisted the goal was to force other developed nations to foot more of the bill for research and development of drugs.\n\n\"Europe is going to have to pay a little bit more. The rest of the world is going to have to pay a little bit more, and America is going to pay a lot less,\" he said.\n\nThe US has taken issue with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the past and Trump has continuously threatened to introduce tariffs on pharmaceuticals, one of Australia's largest exports to the US, worth about $1.6 billion a year.\n\nThe latest move is not a tariff, nor would it have any direct impact on the PBS, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised during the election campaign was off the table in any trade negotiations with the Trump Administration.\n\nREAD MORE: Mum wakes in hospital to discover both fallopian tubes removed \ufeff\n\nPharmaceuticals are seen in North Andover, Massachusetts , on June 15, 2018. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, file)\n\nTop US drugmakers say Trump's order is bad for patients\n\nThe US' pharmaceutical lobby, which represents the top drugmakers, immediately pushed back against Trump's order, calling it a \"bad deal\" for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs.\n\n\"Importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers,\" Stephen J Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement.\n\n\"It would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America.\"\n\nTrump's so-called \"most favoured nation\" approach to Medicare drug pricing has been controversial since he first tried to implement it during his first term. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, which called for the US to only pay a lower price than other countries pay for some drugs \u2014 such as injectables or cancer drugs given through infusions \u2014 administered in a doctor's office.\n\nThat narrow executive order faced hurdles, with a court order that blocked the rule from going into effect under President Joe Biden's administration. The pharmaceutical industry argued that Trump's 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the \"upper hand\" in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.\n\nTop US drugmakers say Trump's order is bad for patients. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)\n\nTrump says other countries are to blame\n\nTrump repeatedly defended pharmaceutical companies, instead blaming other countries for the high price Americans pay for drugs, during a wide-ranging speech at the White House on Monday.\n\nThe president was flanked by Kennedy, Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Dr Mehmet Oz, Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr Marty Makary and National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya.\n\nHe did, however, threaten the companies with federal investigations into their practices and opening up the US drug market to bring in more imported medications from other countries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, with Dr Mehmet Oz, Administrator of the Centres for Medicare & Medicaid Services, left, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, right, holds an executive order related to drug prices, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, May 12, 2025, in Washington.

    "text": "They agreed to take down most of their tariffs that economists warned could start a recession and create shortages on US store shelves.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 2.6 per cent higher in midday trading on Monday (early Tuesday AEST) and back within 5.5 per cent of its all-time high set in February.\n\nTrader Thomas McCauley works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nIt's been roaring higher since falling nearly 20 per cent below the mark last month on hopes that President Donald Trump will lower his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries. It's back above where it was on April 2, Trump's \"Liberation Day,\" when he announced stiff worldwide tariffs that ignited worries about a potentially self-inflicted recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 951 points, or 2.3 per cent, as of 11.30am on Monday (1.30am Tuesday, and the Nasdaq composite was 3.5 per cent higher.\n\nIt wasn't just stocks surging following what one analyst called a \"best case scenario\" for US-China tariff talks.\n\nCrude oil prices jumped more than 3 per cent because a global economy less weakened by tariffs would be hungrier for fuel. The value of the US dollar climbed against everything from the euro to the Japanese yen to the Swiss franc.\n\nAnd US Treasury yields jumped on expectations that the Federal Reserve won't have to cut interest rates so deeply this year in order to protect the economy from the damage of tariffs.\n\nOf course, conditions could change quickly again, as Wall Street has seen all too often in Trump's on-again-off-again rollout of tariffs. Plus, the reduction in US and China tariffs will last only 90 days.\n\nPanic on Wall Street as Trump announces new tariffs View Gallery\n\nThat's to give the world's two largest economies time for more talks followed last weekend's negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, that the US side said had made \"substantial progress\".\n\nUntil then, a joint statement said the United States will cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30 per cent from as high as 145 per cent.\n\nChina said its tariffs on US goods would fall to 10 per cent from 125 per cent. That follows a deal the US announced last week with the United Kingdom that will bring down tariffs on many UK imports to 10 per cent.\n\nBig challenges remain in the negotiations between China and the US, but the mood nevertheless was ebullient across Wall Street on Monday, and gains were widespread.\n\nGold's price fell as investors felt less need to buy something safe.",

    "text": "After being roundly mocked for trading away a generational talent in February, the Dallas Mavericks have beaten the odds to grab another one in June.\n\nThe Mavericks and general manager Nico Harrison were pilloried for sending Luka Don\u010di\u0107 to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis earlier this season, just months after he led Dallas to the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nBut, after missing the play-offs, the ping-pong balls in the NBA Draft Lottery bailed them out, gifting them the first pick in next month's draft, with Duke sensation Cooper Flagg a lock.\n\nAnd just like that, there is something to root for in Dallas again after a tumultuous few months where Don\u010di\u0107 got traded and the Mavs missed the play-offs as Davis suited up for just nine games and the team won 12 of 30 down the stretch.\n\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107 and LeBron James were united in LA after a Dallas-Lakers trade in February. (Getty Images: Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe Lakers lost 4-1 in the first round to Minnesota.\n\nThe Mavericks only had a 1.8 per cent chance of getting the top pick and were long odds (8.5 per cent) of even falling in the top four, prompting shocked reactions around the league and tears of laughter from Don\u010di\u0107's Lakers teammate LeBron James.\n\nRolando Blackman, a four-time All Star with the Mavericks in the 80s and 90s, was representing the team as the draft order was decided and could not hide his glee when the San Antonio Spurs were read out as the number two pick.\n\nBlackman laughed and clasped his hands together as he shook hands with NBA deputy chief executive Mark Tatum.\n\n\"I am so happy for Mavericks fans,\" Dallas chief executive Rick Welts said, clutching the envelope with the number one emblazoned on it.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 trade 'a seismic event in NBA history' Photo shows Rob Pelinka, Luka Doncic and JJ Redick Luka Don\u010di\u0107's controversial move from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers shook the NBA's foundations. Here is why the stunning move has such widespread ramifications.\n\n\"I only got to Dallas January 1st this year. February 1st, we broke the internet. I am just amazed at the depth of emotion and connection that the fan base has with this team. And what happened today.\n\n\"I can't imagine a better day for Mavs fans. It's going to really be something special. I can't wait to get back to Dallas.\"\n\nThe Mavs lost 4-1 to the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals last season, then scorned their fans by trading away Don\u010di\u0107, who clearly did not want to leave as evidenced by the tears he shed when he returned to Dallas as a Laker and the team paid tribute to him.\n\n\"I didn't try to think about it too much,\" Flagg said on the broadcast of the lottery about what it'll likely mean for his immediate future.\n\n\"It was out of my control.\"\n\nCooper Flagg is a consensus top draft pick. (AP: Eric Gay)\n\nIf Miami had lost in the play-in tournament, the Heat would have had the odds that the Mavericks ended up having \u2014 so if the ping-pong balls bounced the same way, they would have had the top pick.\n\n\"I mean come on man,\" Heat forward Kevin Love posted on social media when the lottery winner was announced.\n\n\"There is no f***ing way.\"\n\nDallas was so far out of the picture that when Flagg posed with four NBA teams' caps in a promotional shoot before the lottery, it was New Orleans, Charlotte, Washington and Utah.\n\nCharlotte will pick fourth, with the Jazz, Wizards and Pelicans following them in that order on June 26 despite those four teams having the best odds of picking first going into the lottery.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nFlagg averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.2 assists while leading Duke to the Final Four in his lone college season, and he has had success against NBA players already.\n\nLast summer, when the US Olympic team was holding its training camp in Las Vegas in advance of the Paris Games \u2014 where the Americans won gold yet again \u2014 Flagg was part of the select team brought in for scrimmages against the Olympians.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

    "text": "It's been 10 years since Australia rocked up at the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest with Guy Sebastian singing the achingly safe and respectable 'Tonight Again' as a wildcard entry.\n\nAnd despite yearly questions of \"why is Australia in Eurovision?\", we're still going.\n\nSure, we've failed to qualify for the grand final twice: the first time in 2021 with Montaigne's layered, if convoluted pop track, 'Technicolour', and last year, with ethereal electro-pop duo Electric Fields' dance anthem, 'One Milkali (One Blood)', sung partly in Language.\n\nBut non-qualifying is a normal part of the Eurovision journey for every competing country \u2014 unless you're Ukraine, and have a perfect qualification record.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nAnd Australia has also experienced some real Eurovision highs.\n\nThe highest was undoubtedly coming second in 2016 with Dami Im's powerful, timeless ballad 'Sound of Silence' \u2014 our best result in the competition so far.\n\nNot only have we cracked the top 10 four more times, we've also brought impressive levels of diversity.\n\nOur representing artists have hailed from the likes of Australian Idol, the Queensland Conservatorium of Music and TikTok, and have been overwhelmingly culturally and ethnically diverse; it wasn't until Kate Miller-Heidke \u2014 who came ninth with 'Zero Gravity' in 2019 \u2014 that we had a white Australian Eurovision representative.\n\nThere will always be Eurovision purists who argue non-European countries shouldn't be in the contest \u2014 Israel and Azerbaijan face complaints, too.\n\nBut a decade in, it's starting to feel like we belong.\n\nWhy is Israel allowed to participate in Eurovision even though Russia was banned? Photo shows A woman in a bandaged-style dres sings into a microphone on a stage with an Israeli and a Russian flag either side of her. Russia was excluded in 2022 after the country invaded Ukraine, so why was Israel still allowed to participate in 2024?\n\nShould we stay in Eurovision, though?\n\n\"I don't think there were any other performances in my life, before or since, that have been that intense \u2026 I felt it the whole time,\" says Dami Im of her time on Eurovision in 2016.\n\n\"But when I look back, I feel like it was very special that I got to be a part of something so big.\n\n\"It impacted me on a huge level, like so dramatically. I would say there was me before Eurovision and me after Eurovision. The two Damis are very different to me.\"\n\nNot only was competing in Eurovision \"powerful\" in connecting the Meanjin/Brisbane-based singer-songwriter with a global fan base \u2014 it also helped her see something in herself.\n\n\" I thought, 'If I can do this with this much pressure and have this much support from fans globally, I can keep going. So, it was a huge, significant event for me as an artist, and as a person as well. \"\n\nNine years on, she says she's still benefiting from the \"confidence\" boost Eurovision gave her; just last year, Dami took part in Eurovision on Tour, with a string of concerts across the globe. And she's currently recording her seventh studio album.\n\nDami says \"it was a really heavy thought\" she would always be known by the number she placed: \"But it was true.\" (Getty Images: Michael Campanella/WireImage)\n\nJess Carniel has spent the past decade researching the song contest and our place in it. She agrees Eurovision is a great way to showcase Australian talent to a global audience of 163 million people.\n\n\"Now, we've got fans of Australian artists living in Portugal and Brazil and Sweden and China, and they've got access to these artists watching Eurovision,\" the associate professor in humanities at the University of South Queensland explains.\n\nAnd beyond the kitsch, the drinking games and the joy that is Europop, she says there are many more cultural and political reasons why direct involvement in Eurovision is important for Australia.\n\n\"Once we started participating in Eurovision, it became this really interesting way of feeling connected to the rest of the world. That's a recurring theme in my research.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nCarniel says that connection isn't about our \"European roots\" (\"Australians from a diverse range of backgrounds love Eurovision\"), but forging new cultural and political ties.\n\n\"Especially in this political climate, where our major military partner [the United States] is going off the rails, we need to make sure we're situated in the world in a different way,\" she explains.\n\n\" All the hard-power stuff \u2014 the nuclear submarines and trade deals and everything \u2014 are really important, but the soft power that Eurovision offers is also important. \"\n\nThe birth and death of Eurovision \u2014 Australia Decides\n\nGuy and Dami, as well as their successors, Isaiah and Jessica Mauboy, were all chosen internally by SBS.\n\nThe broadcaster changed things up in 2019, opening the selection process to the Australian public with a national competition.\n\nSet on the Gold Coast, Eurovision \u2014 Australia Decides was a game-changer for fans who struggle to make it to Europe for the main event, the local economy and up-and-coming artists.\n\nBut SBS canned the national contest \u2014 which crowned Kate Miller-Heidke, Montaigne and Sheldon Riley \u2014 after just three editions.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nThe organisation told TV Tonight in 2022: \"A variety of factors contributed to us coming to this decision.\"\n\n\"My understanding is it came down to [the fact] their licensing deal to use the word 'Eurovision' had expired, and apparently running the event was very expensive,\" Carniel says.\n\nShe thinks it's \"really, really sad\" the national competition was scrapped, because it was worthwhile for domestic audiences and brought \"quite a bit to the Gold Coast economy\".\n\n\"And it wasn't just Australians watching it. Someone like Jaguar Jonze has fans around the world, not because she represented us in Eurovision, but because she was part of the national selection,\" Carniel says.\n\nEven the internally selected Dami wants to see Eurovision \u2014 Australia Decides return.\n\n'Do I eat or do I make art?' Australian artists among worst-paid workers Photo shows Madeleine Thornton-Smith, a young woman, smiles in a gallery space, in front of a tapestry that reads \"Union of Working Artists\" A new study of more than 900 Australian artists and arts workers has found poor working conditions and pay are widespread throughout the industry.\n\n\"In Australia, we don't get a lot of opportunities to showcase our music [and] being in the music industry is really, really difficult,\" she says.\n\nBut Emily Griggs, head of the Australian delegation and SBS Entertainment, says SBS has no plans to resume the national competition \"any time soon\".\n\nSince returning to an internal selection process in 2023, SBS has sent two Eurovision \u2014 Australia Decides runners-up to represent Australia: Voyager, followed by Electric Fields.\n\nFor 2025, the broadcaster selected Go-Jo \u2014 a relatively unknown artist who built a following on TikTok and who will represent Australia with 'Milkshake Man'.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nWhere to from here?\n\nCarniel may have dedicated the past decade of her life to researching Australia's involvement in Eurovision, but she's actually \"really, really surprised\" we're competing this year.\n\n\"I felt that last year, the late announcement of Electric Fields, and the fact [SBS] had selected Electric Fields at all, was a swan song,\" she says.\n\nThen came the announcement longtime Australian hosts Myf Warhurst and Joel Creasey would not return, adding to the sense \"we were just in this weird limbo land\".\n\nCountry WA town proud to see homegrown star Go-Jo in Eurovision Photo shows A curly haired man, wears red, white striped tee, jeans leans back on one leg, arms out, hairy underarms. As Go-Jo gears up to represent Australia at Eurovision, he has become the talk of the town in the country community he grew up.\n\nTheir replacements, Courtney Act and Tony Armstrong, were announced just over a month before the 2025 contest.\n\n\"It feels like there isn't the same kind of investment and level of energy there was when we first started, from SBS's side,\" Carniel says.\n\n\"I think SBS needs to demonstrate their commitment a little bit more than they have in the past few years, by keeping us in the loop a little bit more around their plans and decision-making processes.\n\n\" When there's that silence, people get really, really worried and think: 'Well, this is the end of it.' \"\n\nThere's no confirmation yet of our continued participation beyond this year; Australia currently relies on an annual invitation to compete in the contest.\n\nWhile she won't reveal specific figures (\"Eurovision is about much more than dollars and cents\"), Griggs says SBS's \"investment in Eurovision has naturally evolved over the years \u2026 as with any major production\", and that the broadcaster's commitment to the contest \"remains unwavering\".\n\nFar from the end some local fans and experts like Carniel fear, she sees 2025 as the beginning of a \"new chapter\" for Australia in Eurovision.\n\n\" With this revived energy, we will remain true to the incredible Aussie spirit that has always seen us stand out. \"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest airs live and in prime time from May 14-18 exclusively on SBS and SBS On Demand.",

(Supplied: WA Department of Health)\n\nMeasles is a highly infectious, itchy rash with a fever, which typically affects children, but medicos are now seeing a spike in older age groups.\n\nPeople struck down with measles usually have a rash and flu-like symptoms.\n\nIt begins with the \"prodrome phase\" which lasts about two to four days.\n\nWhat is the measles? Photo shows A boy with a third day measles rash. Australia was declared measles-free in 2014, but imported cases are still sometimes diagnosed. So, what does it do to your body, and what sort of threat can it pose to the population?\n\nA person can experience a fever that exceeds 38 degrees Celsius, as well as a cough, runny nose and conjunctivitis \u2014 redness and swelling of the eyes.\n\n\"Often, patients look quite unwell during this time as well, and then as the illness progresses, the rash starts,\" Dr Raman said.\n\nThe measles rash usually begins three to five days after the prodrome phase.\n\nThe rash is usually red, and raised, and can be flat. It typically starts on the face, around the hairline, and then spreads down into the neck, the trunk, the arms, legs, and feet.\n\n\"[The measles rash] is initially spotty, then merges over time to become blotchy patches. And it's always a little bit trickier to see these spots on patients with darker skin tones,\" Dr Raman said.\n\nCalls for preventive measures\n\nMeasles can be a nasty virus, especially for the vulnerable, elderly or immunocompromised.\n\nThe Australian Immunisation Handbook recommends vaccination for people born during or since 1966 who have not received the two doses, particularly healthcare workers, childhood educators, and carers.\n\nDr Raman suggests pregnant women should not get the vaccine but instead speak with their GP.\n\nShe said it was important to see a healthcare professional if you suspect you have the measles to prevent its spread.\n\n\"This is a highly contagious virus, but it's also important for patients to seek medical attention if they're not feeling quite well.\"",

    "text": "Here are a few examples of what that looks like. Short-term v long-term thinking Loading One of the most underrated financial skills is the ability to think long-term. I\u2019m not talking in months or even years, but decades. Here\u2019s the difference in what that sounds like: Short-term: \u201cI need to get on the property ladder as soon as possible.\u201d Long-term: \u201cI want to buy a property I\u2019m happy to hang onto for a couple of decades.\u201d\n\nShort-term: \u201cWhat can I invest in that will give me X per cent return in one to two years?\u201d Long-term: \u201cWhat can I invest in that will still be a quality investment five, 10, 20 years from now?\u201d Long-term thinking is harder \u2013 it takes more patience and delivers less instant gratification. You have to move away from wanting fast results to wanting results that last. Taking the time to create a streamlined savings system won\u2019t deliver the quick wins that chasing after savings hacks will, but it will deliver bigger, more sustainable results long-term. Building wealth is a long-term game. Credit: Getty Images Taking the time to buy a property with your long-term goals in mind won\u2019t satisfy the urgent desire to \u2018get on the property ladder\u2019 now, but it will pay off big-time in a few decades.\n\nFundamentally, wealth is a long-term game. No short-term quick wins will pay off as much as stretching your ability to think long-term in your financial decision-making. Security v opportunity Are you acquiring wealth for security or for opportunity? For most, the drive to earn more, save more and invest more is rooted in a desire for security. This can be a lifelong journey that doesn\u2019t end until you have a fully paid-off house and enough assets to retire. Even then you can still be worried about running out of money. Instead, what if you started asking, \u201cWhat are the opportunities that wealth can make available to me?\u201d This takes you on a totally different journey to \u201cHow do I create financial security?\u201d\n\nOne takes you on a cautious journey where the acquisition of wealth is the end goal. The other opens up possibilities, with wealth being a resource for creating a richer experience of life. \u2018Right decision\u2019 v \u2018right for me\u2019 Loading Initially, you might be fixated on making the \u2018right\u2019 move. What\u2019s the \u2018best\u2019 investment? Should I buy a property or invest in shares? If there\u2019s going to be a market crash, should I sell my investments or ride it out? The thing is, there isn\u2019t one single correct answer. It\u2019s better to think of there being core principles, and you get to choose how you apply those principles to your life.\n\nYou can be financially successful whether you invest in property or shares; whether you buy a property now or rentvest now; whether you invest inside or outside superannuation. Many choices can be a good choice \u2013 so it\u2019s not about trying to determine one universally correct answer but picking the right choice for you. This requires having the self-awareness to know what\u2019s the right choice for you \u2013 and the self-trust to back that choice, even when others appear to be succeeding faster on another path. Often, we get caught up in trying to improve financial results by taking different actions. Chasing a new strategy, trying a new tool, jumping onto the latest investment fad. But better financial results come down to one thing: better decision-making. And better decisions start with better thinking. This is a skill you can learn \u2013 and when you do, financial growth won\u2019t be something you need to chase. It will be inevitable.",

Certainly, there is no other cricketer Australian crowds loved to stir more - ironically, a sign of esteem.\n\nKohli, the incandescent heart of Indian cricket for more than a decade, did not just score runs.

His departure leaves not only a statistical void, but a seismic shift in energy - for there has never been another quite like him.\n\nThere was a time when Indian cricket, particularly overseas, bore the air of respectful submission - playing with technical skill, yes, but often with psychological inferiority. That changed in stages. Sourav Ganguly gave it a new spine. MS Dhoni brought ice-cold leadership and white-ball dominance. But Kohli? Kohli lit the fire.

    "text": "Here are a few examples of what that looks like. Short-term v long-term thinking Loading One of the most underrated financial skills is the ability to think long-term. I\u2019m not talking in months or even years, but decades. Here\u2019s the difference in what that sounds like: Short-term: \u201cI need to get on the property ladder as soon as possible.\u201d Long-term: \u201cI want to buy a property I\u2019m happy to hang onto for a couple of decades.\u201d\n\nShort-term: \u201cWhat can I invest in that will give me X per cent return in one to two years?\u201d Long-term: \u201cWhat can I invest in that will still be a quality investment five, 10, 20 years from now?\u201d Long-term thinking is harder \u2013 it takes more patience and delivers less instant gratification. You have to move away from wanting fast results to wanting results that last. Taking the time to create a streamlined savings system won\u2019t deliver the quick wins that chasing after savings hacks will, but it will deliver bigger, more sustainable results long-term. Building wealth is a long-term game. Credit: Getty Images Taking the time to buy a property with your long-term goals in mind won\u2019t satisfy the urgent desire to \u2018get on the property ladder\u2019 now, but it will pay off big-time in a few decades.\n\nFundamentally, wealth is a long-term game. No short-term quick wins will pay off as much as stretching your ability to think long-term in your financial decision-making. Security v opportunity Are you acquiring wealth for security or for opportunity? For most, the drive to earn more, save more and invest more is rooted in a desire for security. This can be a lifelong journey that doesn\u2019t end until you have a fully paid-off house and enough assets to retire. Even then you can still be worried about running out of money. Instead, what if you started asking, \u201cWhat are the opportunities that wealth can make available to me?\u201d This takes you on a totally different journey to \u201cHow do I create financial security?\u201d\n\nOne takes you on a cautious journey where the acquisition of wealth is the end goal. The other opens up possibilities, with wealth being a resource for creating a richer experience of life. \u2018Right decision\u2019 v \u2018right for me\u2019 Loading Initially, you might be fixated on making the \u2018right\u2019 move. What\u2019s the \u2018best\u2019 investment? Should I buy a property or invest in shares? If there\u2019s going to be a market crash, should I sell my investments or ride it out? The thing is, there isn\u2019t one single correct answer. It\u2019s better to think of there being core principles, and you get to choose how you apply those principles to your life.\n\nYou can be financially successful whether you invest in property or shares; whether you buy a property now or rentvest now; whether you invest inside or outside superannuation. Many choices can be a good choice \u2013 so it\u2019s not about trying to determine one universally correct answer but picking the right choice for you. This requires having the self-awareness to know what\u2019s the right choice for you \u2013 and the self-trust to back that choice, even when others appear to be succeeding faster on another path. Often, we get caught up in trying to improve financial results by taking different actions. Chasing a new strategy, trying a new tool, jumping onto the latest investment fad. But better financial results come down to one thing: better decision-making. And better decisions start with better thinking. This is a skill you can learn \u2013 and when you do, financial growth won\u2019t be something you need to chase. It will be inevitable.",

Source: Darren Spencer\n\nA classic Aussie trade could be gutted in one state if the Albanese Labor Government follows through on a controversial plan, according to industry insiders.\n\nShearers point to a unique set of circumstances that mean an upcoming ban of live sheep exports will have a ripple effect set to decimate the prized merino wool industry in Western Australia.\n\n\u201cThe ban doesn't come into effect until May, 2028 but farmers are making decisions now on what they do,\u201d WA Shearing Industry Association president Darren Spencer told Yahoo News. \u201cRight across our membership here, most contractors have got a lot less work,\u201d he said.\n\nCramming live sheep into pens and shipping them 10,000km has long been controversial, and animal advocates are thankful for Labor\u2019s planned ban. Groups like Animals Australia and the RSPCA say the industry has a \u201cdark history\u201d and raised concerns about welfare at sea and after disembarking in the Middle East where butchering traditions are different to our own.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cLive sheep export is fundamentally cruel and it cannot be fixed. Literally millions of sheep have died and all have suffered through this trade in live animals,\u201d an Animals Australia spokesperson told Yahoo.\n\n\u201cAnimals Australia has conducted dozens of investigations over two decades and always finds suffering, lodging 76 legal complaints showing exporters' unwillingness to follow even basic rules.\u201d\n\nThe wool industry supports more than just shearing jobs. Source: Darren Spencer\n\nShearers who can process 150 sheep a day can make $600 to $750 a day. Source: Darren Spencer\n\nWhile Animals Australia argues suffering associated with live export is ongoing, \u201cinherent and unfixable\u201d, peak body the Australian Livestock Exporters' Council has dismissed allegations about ongoing animal welfare problems.\n\nIts CEO Mark Harvey-Sutton told Yahoo there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d there were issues prior to reforms in 2018, but exporters have significantly improved, with one just recording its best voyage ever \u2014 22 mortalities out of a shipment of 50,000 animals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat it boils down to is this government has made a deal with activists and made this decision based on ideology rather than evidence,\u201d he said.\n\nWill only farmers and shearers be impacted by the ban?\n\nHarvey-Sutton estimates Western Australia\u2019s flocks have already declined by 25 per cent in the last 12 months. The industry warns it's not just the farmers and the labourers they employ that will be impacted, but also shops and other businesses in rural communities they buy from. The wool industry alone isn\u2019t just shearers and farmers, there are also brokers, handlers, dumpers, testers and transporters.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the precedent that this sets, this is the first time the government's actually shut down a rural industry. We anticipated what the impact would be, and so far we've been proven correct. But in terms of how bad the damage is, sadly, we'll just have to see over time,\u201d he said.\n\nPerth is widely considered the world\u2019s most isolated major city, and so it's unsurprising that Western Australia\u2019s sheep market runs separately from the rest of the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSouth Australia ceased live sheep export in 2018, but in the west, the industry continues to have a major influence on sheep prices. Although live export only makes up 1 per cent of Australia\u2019s sheep and wool exports, Harvey-Sutton says it plays an important role, creating pricing competition in Western Australia.\n\n\u201c[Now] exporters and processors have to compete with each other, so you get a higher price naturally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou take that away, they don't have to compete\u2026 prices drop, and then that's less income for the producer. Then the producer has to make a decision \u2014 am I earning enough income to continue producing sheep?\u201d\n\nAnimals Australia claims live export has \u201cinherent and unfixable\u201d problems, but the industry maintains it has reformed itself. Source: Getty\n\nHow will ripples of live export ban harm the wool industry?\n\nThere\u2019s a specific impact on the wool industry that the WA Shearing Industry Association has witnessed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCross-bred sheep put on weight so fast and are often slaughtered before they've sprouted a fleece worth shearing. Merino sheep are slower to mature and are reared because their fleece is of a superior quality. They\u2019ll normally be shorn multiple times before they\u2019re sent to slaughter, providing lots of work for shearers.\n\n\u201cMerino ewes are always sought after, you can always get rid of them for breeding. But it\u2019s the merino wethers [non-breeding males] that you can\u2019t get rid of,\u201d Darren Spencer said.\n\nMerino sheep are generally shorn multiple times before slaughter, while cross-breeds put on weight much faster. Source: Getty\n\nAfter 12 months of age, these wethers are considered mutton and they sell for a lower amount than lamb. While finding an abattoir to slaughter them at a good price in Western Australia can be a problem, there\u2019s more interest overseas.\n\n\u201cLive export is so important to us, because it takes those slower maturing merinos out of the system and gives them a much better value than they have in the [local] abattoirs,\u201d Spencer said.\n\nWhen sheep lost value in the 1990s, farmers simply shot and buried them, and Spencer is fearful of history repeating. While the planned live export ban isn\u2019t the only issue sheep farmers face, he thinks the loss of live export will be an added blow that will \u201ccut the guts\u201d out of the wool industry.\n\nThere are few abattoirs left in Western Australia that process sheep, and much of the state is in drought. Rearing animals in feedlots so they put on weight before they become mutton is expensive because the price of grain is high. So those wanting to raise merino sheep are looking to the greener pastures in the east of Australia.\n\nShearers who can process 150 sheep can make $600 to $750 in a day, but the work is increasingly inconsistent.\n\n\"That's the problem now, we will have banks to work for three to four months, and then there'll be time to sit down,\" Spencer said. \"It's not really good having groups of shearers just sitting around.\"\n\nWas the sheep industry already in trouble?\n\nAnimals Australia argues the sheep export trade has been in \u201cterminal decline\u201d for decades, with numbers falling from six million annually in the early 2000s to around 400,000 in 2024. It told Yahoo decreases in flock size have been triggered by farmers moving from livestock to cropping.\n\n\u201cThe change is happening and whether the live sheep trade was to have continued or not, farmers and utility workers such as shearers would be adapting,\u201d its spokesperson said.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

It was good timing now to go through and make the house much more energy efficient.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKicking gas meant losing the dollar a day connection fee as the family also set about making their home as thermally efficient as possible to \"generally lower our footprint,\" Grace said.\n\nIn the considerable revamp of the family's circa 1919 single-fronted weatherboard cottage in inner Melbourne, they replaced a gas ducted heating and evaporative cooler system with reverse-cycle air-conditioning, gas cooking with an induction cooktop and electric oven, and gas hot water with an electric heat pump.\n\n\"We're saving a dollar a day on just not having a gas connection,\" Grace noted, saying that as they gradually moved away from using gas-powered appliances, it was only their instant hot water that relied on it.\n\n\"Our last gas bill, I think it was over a 60-day period, we had $60 for gas connection and about $20 worth of actual gas use,\" she told Yahoo.\n\nThe house has been retrofitted with all new electric appliances. Source: Grace Mitchell/Facebook\n\nConverting from gas cheaper than moving, homeowner says\n\nWhile Grace admits they were fortunate enough to have the money to do the renovations and make the environmentally friendly changes, upgrading the older house still made financial sense when compared to potentially moving and incurring the related costs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Just buying and selling the house... with stamp duty and everything, you're going to drop $100,000 just shifting if you've got an average house in Melbourne. So you can do quite a lot on your existing house if you kind of think of it like that.\"\n\nShe joined a Facebook group called My Efficient Home which today has more than 140,000 members where people share tips \"about improving the comfort and energy performance of Australian homes\".\n\n\"House is so much more thermally efficient and comfortable to live in,\" Grace posted to the group recently about the changes she made. \"Thanks to this group for all the knowledge gleaned along the way to help us figure all this out!\"\n\nShe's far from the only one partaking in the national trend.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I am only the last of many to celebrate no longer using gas,\" another Aussie group member who posted about their transition, which took place over a six-year period, told Yahoo News.\n\n\"I have been working to this over the last years gradually replacing appliances as I could afford to do so. Some people have been able to do a house renovation and then complete the work in one go,\" she added.\n\nAustralia has the highest penetration rate of rooftop solar in the world. Source: Getty\n\nHalf of Aussies considering turning off gas\n\nAccording to research by Energy Consumers Australia last year, there has \"been a clear shift\" in the past three years of Aussie homeowners thinking about getting off gas, with more than 50 per cent considering cutting their connection fully.\n\nSimilar findings were found in a survey by the Australian Institute in 2023 with 55 per cent of Aussies saying they felt positively about electrifying more homes. \"With electric technology now readily available, the biggest barrier to making that switch is the upfront cost of transition,\" the Australian Institute's Noah Schultz-Byard said at the time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAustralia has the highest penetration rate of rooftop solar in the world, and after the federal Labor government's romping election win this month, households across the country can look forward to a $2.3 billion subsidy program to help homeowners with the cost of installing a home battery.\n\n\"In the future we'll think about upgrading our solar... and potentially a battery,\" Grace told Yahoo when asked about the policy. \"It's always nice to get the incentive of subsidies, but you're still having to outlay cash yourself.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "Campground fees could soon be as much as nine times the amount at some sites if the proposal is rolled out.\n\nOutback Mike is urging Aussies to speak up against the camping changes proposed by NSW authorities. Source: TikTok/outbackmike & Getty\n\nOutback Mike has urged campers to speak up against a major proposal that would overhaul camping in the country's most populous state, with the renowned adventurer concerned everyday Australians could soon be discouraged from enjoying the bush due to increased campground prices.\n\nMike Atkinson, who appeared on the popular TV show Alone Australia, believes increasing the cost of campgrounds in New South Wales is not the answer to tackling problems the recent surge in camping has created, such as limited campsite accessibility and ghost bookings.\n\nHe told Yahoo News he worries the state's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) simply sees the potential to make \"heaps of money\" from the 49 per cent surge in campground visitations reported by authorities over the last decade.\n\n\"The really serious thing is that they are introducing camping fees to an enormous percentage of campgrounds that never had them before,\" Mike said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Never in the history of parks has there ever been a camping fee there... and now my guess is 60 to 70 per cent of campgrounds will have fees for the first time ever. I feel that the executives in NSW National Parks are running it like a business, and it's not, it's a public service.\"\n\nThe service manages 895 parks and reserves which make up roughly 10 per cent of the state's total land mass. NSW authorities claim there are now 1.8 million overnight campground stays every year.\n\nHow would campers be impacted by the proposed change?\n\nThe NPWS proposal involves a state-wide approach to campground pricing, with every site categorised into one of six tiers with an attached price bracket based on its amenities. There would be a different nightly price for camping at high season compared to low season for each campground.\n\nThe proposed NSW campground tiering system. Source: NSW NPWS consultation paper\n\nFor example, Thredbo Diggings campground \u2014 situated in NSW's Snowy Mountains region \u2014 could increase from $6 to $54 per night during high season, as it would be classified as a tier four campground with tables, barbecues and shelters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMike camped there in July last year and said the prospect of paying nine times the nightly amount to stay at the same campground is unreasonable.\n\n\"They care more about extracting money from people than they do about solving the problem. That is my honest opinion,\" Mike said.\n\nStaying at many popular campgrounds around the state is expected to increase in price under the proposal.\n\nIt could soon cost nine times more for a camper to sleep overnight at Thredbo Diggings campground. Source: ExplorOz & TikTok/outbackmike\n\nWhat alternative solutions could tackle camping issues?\n\nMike has been a firm believer that scrapping booking systems would solve many of the problems faced by campers and authorities. Without a booking system, ghost bookings would be eradicated as a first come, first service approach would be the only option, stopping people from claiming a campsite online they later don't physically show up and use.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The solution is to get rid of the booking system,\" he said.\n\nHowever, a 2022 NPWS survey of the most frequent national park campers found 87 per cent of respondents \"wanted to be able to book a site because it gives them certainty\".\n\nMike also believes a simple increase in the supply of campgrounds to offset the sudden increase of demand is a no-brainer.\n\n\"They're saying 49 per cent extra people are visiting the parks but nowhere in their proposal did they consider increasing the amount of campsites by 49 per cent, therefore meeting demand,\" he said.\n\nTo provide your feedback before May 25, click here to access the NPWS survey.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
