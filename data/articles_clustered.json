(Getty Images: Naomi Baker)\n\nAltschwager said that the 13 athletes who took part in this year's inaugural Launch Pad Program have already created \"a sense of community and connection.\"\n\n\"We have great lived experience in the unit, including three Paralympians, and strength and conditioning coaches with cerebral palsy,\" Altschwager said.\n\n\"Put that all together in a melting pot and it creates a great environment for the athletes coming through.\"\n\nWith a world-class training facility and staff who are leaders in their field, the foundation is set for South Australian talent to develop and strive for gold on the world stage.\n\n\"All of us have been able to witness the athletes blossom and bloom within this environment over the past few months,\" Petricola said.\n\n\"For some of our younger athletes, we expect them to go out and try a number of sports.

(ABC News: Grace Burmas )\n\nSince Bravo hit the domestic market in 2016, Soluna apples have gone on to stock supermarket shelves across Asia and the Middle East.\n\nWA Farm Direct general manager Elliot Jones said the first shipment to the US was small.\n\n\"This is a market test \u2014 two containers worth \u2014 to get an understanding of where we would sit in the segment,\" Mr Jones said.\n\n\"It's a premium apple, so we wanted to test it to set the platform for next year.\"\n\nElliot Jones (right) says the Soluna apple has already seen major success in international markets.

(Supplied: Elliot Jones)\n\nAre WA growers in support?\n\nMr Jones said WA Farm Direct was also preparing to export Soluna apples to China next year after securing market access, but added it would need to encourage more investment to meet demand.\n\n\"Between the US and China, two of the world's largest economies, we are in great shape to be able to capitalise,\" he said.\n\n\"We will have to make a decision on how much fruit we will have available early next year.\n\n\"We are in a situation right now where we need more fruit, so we are encouraging further investment in the program to meet future demand.\"\n\nThe deep purple colour of Bravo apples make them unique. (ABC: Chris Lewis)\n\nHowever, not all growers are convinced the move into new markets is a good idea.\n\nVic Grozotis grows Bravos at his commercial orchard in the south west town of Manjimup, 300 kilometres south of Perth.\n\nHe said he was not convinced on the future of the recent export shipment to America.\n\n\"We don't even know what returns we are going to get for it, it is small volumes \u2014 it's just another feel good story coming out from the promoters of Bravo,\" Mr Grozotis said.\n\nVic Grozotis grows apples on the same land his family once farmed tobacco. (ABC South West: Kate Forrester)\n\n\"Last year, Bravo was my lowest returning variety \u2014 they are asking us to grow more of this when realistically we don't have any baseline price and don't know what the return is going to be.\n\n\"You must remember, there are so many varieties coming on to the global market.\n\n\" I think this export will fail. \"\n\nBut there are other south west WA growers who are optimistic on the growth of these new markets.\n\nAnn Lyster is a Manjimup apple farmer and is also chair of West Australian apple cooperative, Fruit West.\n\nFruit West chair and Manjimup apple grower Ann Lyster. (ABC: Chris Lewis)\n\n\"There is a very good business case that can be made for being able to supply not only the domestic market, but the international market as well,\" Ms Lyster said.\n\n\"The coordinated marketing of Bravo \u2014 Soluna \u2014 doesn't suit all growers, but I think there is a great percentage that are very happy with the marketing that is being worked on.\"",

    "text": "There comes a time in every great team's rise to a premiership where they come face to face with adversity.\n\nAdversity can come in many forms in sport, whether it is a rival team undoing your best-laid plans or perhaps an unexpected injury.\n\nRankine's ban pales in comparison to widespread impact of homophobia Photo shows Izak Rankine of the Crows prepares before a game. Young LGBTQIA+ Australians are turning away from community sport due to the high prevalence of homophobia, queerphobia and discrimination.\n\nIt can also be self-inflicted, as is the case for the AFL's ladder-leaders Adelaide, which will now be without Izak Rankine for the next four matches as it looks to end a 27-year premiership drought.\n\nRankine's suspension comes as no surprise, and while it is a detriment to Adelaide's premiership chances, it should be celebrated because the importance of finals matches and premierships pale in comparison to the problem that is widespread homophobia. The real surprise is the length of the ban.\n\nAFL boss Andrew Dillon did himself and the league no favours by refusing to elaborate on the \"compelling medical submissions\" that saw Rankine given a slim chance of reappearing this season, should the Crows make it to a grand final.\n\nIn their apparent pursuit of trying to appease all the parties involved, the widespread reaction to the Rankine verdict suggests the AFL may have somehow achieved the exact opposite.\n\nPrior to this week, Adelaide was one of the best stories to come out of the home and away season, courtesy of a meteoric rise from 15th last year.\n\nAfter coming into the year under immense pressure to keep his spot, Adelaide coach Matthew Nicks has delivered in spades. (AAP: Matt Turner)\n\nIn an era where many teams prioritise stopping the opposition before scoring themselves, Matthew Nicks's Crows have been an offensive juggernaut while being stout defensively, becoming one of the most watchable teams to grace the AFL in several years. Rankine has been at the heart of that, along with Adelaide captain Jordan Dawson, who has elevated himself into the Brownlow Medal conversation this year.\n\nThere is no way to spin the on-field impact of Rankine's absence as a positive for Adelaide; he will be sorely missed.\n\nThe bedrock of all great footy teams is reliability and consistency, and the Crows have delivered in spades on both this season.\n\nIf you switch a Crows game on, you know what you're going to get. A sturdy defence that gets a job done week-in, week-out, a team that is able to turn defence into offence in a heartbeat, and a forward line featuring three key forwards that have beaten opposing defences to a pulp.\n\nRankine's game-breaking ability will be sorely missed by Adelaide to start its finals campaign. (AAP Image/Matt Turner)\n\nRankine is the X factor in all of this that lifts the Crows from a team that is really good, to one that is a genuine shot at winning the premiership.\n\nEvery great team has this: the one player whose magnet the coach is willing to move around the board to really make things happen. It was Dustin Martin on the great Richmond teams, Jason Akermanis on the three-peat Lions, Cyril Rioli on the three-peat Hawks, and it's Rankine on this year's Crows.\n\nA game-breaker like Rankine is doubly important on the finals stage, where games are often tense affairs where teams have scouted each other to the nth degree.\n\nAdelaide came from behind to beat Hawthorn in Round 21 in a match that was played at finals-like intensity, and it was the perfect example of how important Rankine is to this Crows outfit.\n\nHis final numbers, three goals and 16 disposals, don't tell the full story, but they never do with players like Rankine.\n\nWith the Crows trailing by eight points heading into the final quarter, Nicks activated the Rankine switch.\n\nAfter attending just one centre bounce for the first three quarters, Rankine was plugged into the middle in the final term and wreaked havoc, picking up seven disposals, two clearances, and kicking two backbreaking goals while setting up another with a direct assist as one of five score involvements.\n\nWhat other players might manage in terms of impact stats in an entire match, Rankine can conjure up in 10 minutes of football; it's what makes him special.\n\nWith Rankine sidelined, more pressure and responsibility will fall onto the broad shoulders of Riley Thilthorpe in Adelaide's forward line. (Getty Images: James Elsby)\n\nOutside of Dawson, Rankine is the only real game-breaker for Adelaide who can toggle seamlessly between the midfield and the forward line, unless you include big man Riley Thilthorpe, who often logs minutes as a ruckman while the Crows' first-choice ruckman, Reilly O'Brien, rests.\n\nWith Rankine sidelined, even more of an emphasis will fall on Thilthorpe to ignite the Crows, something which he's shown an ability to do throughout the course of the year.\n\nMaking matters worse for Adelaide, Rankine won't be the only dangerous small forward missing from the Crows' finals push, with Josh Rachele (25 goals in 13 appearances this season) also sidelined with a knee injury.\n\nRachele has returned to running this week and no longer requires a knee brace, and is expected to be available in \"two to three weeks\".\n\nJosh Rachele has not played since July 6 and will suddenly be required to make a major impact when he returns for the finals. (Getty Images: AFL Photos/James Elsby)\n\nHowever, requiring him to go from rehab straight into making a major impact on a finals match seems like a tough ask, even if Rachele has shown a penchant for making the difficult look easy during his short career.\n\nFor now, replacing Rankine and Rachele's output will have to be done by committee. There are simply no like-for-like replacements for players like them.\n\nBen Keays has shown his ability to play at his best when the stakes are at their highest, and Nicks will be able to rely on him to rise to the occasion.\n\nAlex Neal-Bullen has proven to be an inspired recruit, and his finals experience from a number of deep runs with Melbourne, including a premiership win in 2021, will also prove invaluable.\n\nAdelaide captain Jordan Dawson has elevated himself into one of the AFL's best players, and will need to be at his best during the upcoming finals series. (Getty Images/AFL Photos: Sarah Reed)\n\nRankine's presence has allowed Dawson to float in and out of the midfield during the course of the season, but it is now likely he will have to log full-time midfield minutes, and with it some potentially heavy tags.\n\nAdversity, such as what is currently on Adelaide's doorstep, offers an opportunity for growth and can often define an entire era for a club, both on and off the field.\n\nIt is an opportunity for the club to grow as a whole as it looks to actually stamp out homophobia. Adelaide's powerbrokers need to drive home the fact that no-tolerance should mean exactly that, and no less.\n\nIt may not seem like it right now, but this is also an incredible opportunity for Rankine.\n\nLoading...\n\nRankine will turn 26 in the early months of next season, his seventh in the AFL system. He is no longer a precocious young talent, but rather someone required to set an example for the teenagers coming through at Adelaide.\n\nIf he harbours aspirations of being a legitimate leader at the club, his behaviour following this incident will determine whether he is able to achieve that dream.\n\nThere is also an opportunity for Rankine's teammates as his absence forces someone else to step up and be a game-breaker. The Crows adopting a next-man-up mentality on the field will make them a better outfit when Rankine returns to the fold.\n\nNicks would have anticipated his team's first real test of their premiership mettle would come when they take the field for their first final and beyond.\n\nBut after a home and away season that has been relatively smooth sailing, gut-check time is here a little earlier than anticipated.",

(Supplied: Kathy Gabriel)\n\nThe competition draws adventure-seeking riders from across the globe to trek 1,000 kilometres through the mountains, green open valleys and wetlands of Mongolia on the backs of semi-wild horses.\n\nCompetitors change steeds every 35 kilometres and must navigate and survive on their own wits and skill, living among the Mongolian herders.\n\nCompetitors ride semi-wild horses.

(Supplied: Kathy Gabriel)\n\nParticipants can enter the Mongol Derby as individuals or as part of a team, which was the obvious choice for the couple from Harvey, in Western Australia's South West.\n\n\"Some people would say, 'Why on earth would you want to do that with your partner?' [or], 'I'd never do that with my wife', so I was like, 'I wonder how this is going to go,'\" Lucy said.\n\n\"But obviously, the toughness of Brandon I've always respected, and then I respect him even more now.\"\n\nLucy Fiore has been riding horses since she could walk. (Supplied: Kathy Gabriel)\n\nTough conditions\n\nPart of why the Mongol Derby has the reputation as the toughest race in the world is because less than 50 per cent of riders usually finish.\n\nThe statistic only made the couple more determined to reach the end.\n\nBrandon Fiore first rode a horse three years ago. (Supplied: Kathy Gabriel)\n\nBrandon said he fell off several horses over the last few days, but one was a particular \"nightmare\" as he struggled to get it under control.\n\n\"I tried to hold onto the ropes so bad, and it dragged me, and I still have cuts on my fingers from it.\"\n\nBrandon Fiore says the race is physically and mentally challenging. (Supplied: Brandon Fiore)\n\nBrandon said they were not able to track down the horse, which was still carrying his saddle bag full of supplies.\n\n\"I had no sleeping bag, no clothes \u2026 I was snuggling up to Lucy, trying to use her sleeping bag, and it was freezing at night,\" he said.\n\nThe Mongol Derby is modelled after the world's first long-distance postal system set up by Ghengis Khan in 1224. (Supplied: Kathy Gabriel)\n\nOn the last day, only 8 kilometres from the finish line, Brandon was met with a timely reminder to always listen to his wife.\n\nHis chaps \u2014 which help protect a rider's legs \u2014 had completely fallen apart, on the same day the pair was attacked by a pack of \"30 dogs\".\n\nBrandon said he nearly took his chaps off until his wife suggested otherwise.\n\nBrandon and Lucy Fiore faced several challenges during the race. (Supplied: Kathy Gabriel)\n\n\"Lucky I did [leave them on] because I was sitting there [trying to ignore] the dog and it's run up and jumped up and bitten me on the side of the leg,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got a hole in my calf [of the chaps] still, but it didn't go through the chaps thankfully.\"\n\nWorking as a team\n\nThe pair agreed the event was the ultimate relationship test, but they were able to remain a team.\n\nThe ride was a test of the couple's endurance and dedication to each other. (Supplied: Kathy Gabriel)\n\n\"She was so good at navigation, it was like having a Tom Tom next to you,\" Brandon said.\n\n\" Having that mental support, the good outweighs the bad when you've got someone there with you. \"\n\nLucy said Brandon supported her in \"every way possible\" throughout the race, especially when she needed to \"have a cry\" or was second-guessing herself.\n\nLucy Fiore says the race tested her limits. (Suppled: Kathy Gabriel)\n\n\"They say it's really hard to ride in a pair, which is true \u2026 but I only rode 10 kilometres by myself and it sucked,\" she said.\n\n\"I knew Brandon would never give up \u2026 he's very mentally tough, pain just doesn't bother him \u2026 so I was like, there's no way I can give up.\"\n\nDespite the injuries, mental exhaustion and navigating an unfamiliar landscape across 1,000km, the pair finished in nine days and placed third, just behind two other groups.",

    "text": "The Trump administration is considering a plan to reallocate at least $US2 billion ($3.1b) from the CHIPS Act to fund critical minerals projects and boost Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's influence over the strategic sector, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe proposed move would take from funds already allocated by US Congress for semiconductor research and chip factory construction, avoiding a fresh spending request as it seeks to reduce US dependence on China for critical minerals used widely in the electronics and defence industries.\n\nBoosting Mr Lutnick's role over critical minerals financing would also help centralise the administration's approach to the sector, a push sought by White House officials after the rollout of the Pentagon investment in rare earths company MP Materials last month sparked questions about the US government's minerals strategy, one source said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. Pentagon officials were not immediately available to comment. MP Materials declined to comment.\n\nThe Commerce Department oversees the $US52.7 billion ($82b) CHIPS Act, formally known as the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nThe act, signed into law by then-president Joe Biden in 2022, has provided funding so far for research while also seeking to lure chip production away from Asia and boost American domestic semiconductor production.\n\nBut since taking office in January, Trump has moved to change the CHIPS Act \u2014 legislation he has called \"a horrible, horrible thing\" that amounts to a giveaway to companies \u2014 largely by renegotiating grants to chipmakers.\n\nRepurposing some funds for mining-related projects would align in part with the spirit of the CHIPS Act as the semiconductor industry requires abundant supplies of germanium, gallium and other critical minerals over which China has tightened its market control, said the sources, who were not permitted to speak publicly about the deliberations.\n\n\"The administration is creatively trying to find ways to fund the critical minerals sector,\" said the first source. The plans are under discussion and could change, the sources added.\n\nMining companies themselves could benefit, but also processing and recycling firms. Most of the minerals considered critical by the US government are not processed inside the country.\n\nKent Masters, CEO of North Carolina-based Albemarle, the world's largest producer of lithium for rechargeable batteries, told Reuters last month that the company's stalled plans to build a US lithium refinery were \"difficult now without some type of government support or partnership.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the Trump administration aimed to use the funds for grants or equity stakes in mining companies, but Mr Lutnick aimed to \"get the $US2 billion out the door\" as soon as possible, the first source said, adding that the administration aimed to find other funds to reallocate in the near future.\n\nA former US official said the Biden administration considered using CHIPS Act grants for rare earths but decided it was uneconomical, required many environmental exemptions and was best left for the Department of Energy to handle.\n\nThe administration is also looking to use CHIPS Act-related funding to take equity stakes in Intel and other chip makers in exchange for cash grants, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\n\nMr Trump moved quickly to expand US critical minerals production since taking office in January by signing executive orders to boost deep-sea mining and domestic projects.\n\nOn Tuesday, he met with the CEOs of Rio Tinto and BHP at the White House despite the ongoing negotiations with European leaders over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a move aimed at underscoring his support for US mining.\n\nThe CHIPS Act deliberations come after the Energy Department last week proposed $US1 billion in spending for some critical minerals projects, with funds tied to the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nExclusive report from Reuters",

(Facebook: Southern Highlands Wildlife Sanctuary)\n\n\"My early career was in engineering and manufacturing, and I spent a lot of time in business, so it [the partnership with Mr Creighton] does seem a bit of an odd fit,\" Mr Lewis said.\n\n\" But we all have a responsibility to care and leave our nature better than what it was before and when you live amongst it, you see the deficits. \"\n\nTheir conversation led to the dream of creating a new wildlife sanctuary for the Southern Highlands and restoring the local population of one of Australia's most loved marsupials.\n\nAmbitious plan to boost koala numbers\n\nLike many parts of Australia, Bundanoon was once a thriving area for koalas.\n\nBut according to NSW BioNet, which holds biodiversity data and is managed by the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, the only record of koalas in the nearby Morton National Park was recorded in 2016.\n\nThat was prior to the devastating bushfires of 2019-'20.\n\nMr Lewis says the Morton National Park has lost its once-vibrant koala population. (ABC New England North West: Donal Sheil)\n\nMr Lewis and Mr Creighton have set themselves the goal of restoring the area's koala population.\n\n\"Translocation is the way, and we've identified some populations that may work for us,\" Mr Lewis said.\n\nPeter Lewis is working with scientists to ensure a successful translocation of koalas into the Morton National Park. (ABC Illawarra: Justin Huntsdale)\n\n\"We're looking at the barriers to entry \u2014 things like the genetic profile of koalas to resist the stress of translocation, to acclimatise them to the trees they'll source their food from and to make sure they're disease free.\n\n\"We have an advisory board of professors working with us to develop the program and we're confident in the next three years we'll be ready to start the process to release.\"\n\nMr Lewis acknowledged the recent koala deaths as part of a translocation in southern NSW, and said his organisation was doing extensive work to ensure it did not happen as part of their work.\n\nThe Morton National Park occupies nearly 200,000 hectares in the Southern Highlands. (ABC Illawarra: Justin Huntsdale)\n\nSaul Deane from the Total Environment Centre said any koala conservation work should start by providing healthy habitat and addressing diseases like chlamydia.\n\nHe said research should also be directed at why a large national park does not accommodate koalas now.\n\n\"Translocation of koalas was only prioritised in the koala strategy as it enables developers to avoid the necessity of providing koala corridors. It takes conservation obligations off them,\" Mr Deane said.\n\n\"People interested in koala protections must avoid playing into this trap which could turn their area into a koala sink, which is what happens when there are no koala corridors.\"",

    "text": "A Perth doctor has been referred to the health practitioner watchdog after the \"devastating\" and \"preventable\" death of a two-year-old boy following a circumcision.\n\nA coronial inquest found doctor Raad Hassan failed in his professional duty to take the necessary measures to ensure the boy's safety after performing the surgery at his clinic in December 2021.\n\nDavid Kalunga Flynn was two years and eight months old when he and his eight-month-old brother, Joseph, each underwent the procedure at Gosnells Medical Clinic upon their mother's request.\n\nDr Hassan performed both surgeries and, as was his usual practice, sedated David with morphine but not Joseph, due to his age.\n\nAhead of the surgery David was given morphine. (Supplied)\n\nThe boys were sent home with their mother, Alice, a little after 2pm \u2014 about an hour after the first surgery was performed.\n\nAt the time of discharge, David was still heavily sedated from the morphine and Joseph was suffering increasing pain and bleeding.\n\nHours later, Mrs Flynn found David unresponsive with his skin cold to the touch.\n\nAn ambulance was called and both David and Joseph were taken to Armadale Hospital.\n\nDespite ongoing resuscitation efforts, David was declared dead at 8.03pm that same evening.\n\nWhile Mrs Flynn was trying to come to terms with that news, she was told Joseph needed to be transferred to Perth Children's Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery to control bleeding from his frenular artery, damaged during the circumcision.\n\nMorphine overdose cause of death\n\nIn her report, Coroner Robyn Hartley said David was a happy, healthy child with no pre-existing conditions who never woke from the deep sedation administered for the circumcision.\n\n\"David was a much-loved child taken from his family in devastating circumstances,\" Coroner Hartley wrote.\n\n\"He underwent a simple, elective procedure that is generally considered to be safe when performed on healthy children.\n\n\"The critical issue in David's case arose out of the administration of sedation in the form of morphine.\n\nThe coroner found David died of a morphine overdose, which could have been avoided. (Supplied)\n\n\"Procedural sedation, particularly in children, comes with significant known risks \u2026 [which] can be mitigated if the sedationist complies with requirements aimed at ensuring patient safety.\"\n\nCoroner Hartley found David ultimately died of a morphine overdose \u2014 which could have been identified and rectified if Dr Hassan had conducted the appropriate monitoring during and after the procedure.\n\nBoy dies after circumcision in Perth's southern suburbs Photo shows Photo of baby feet A two-year-old boy dies after undergoing a medical procedure \u2014 believed to be a circumcision \u2014 at a registered medical centre in Perth's southern suburbs.\n\n\"This would very likely have saved his life,\" she said.\n\n\"The three highly qualified medical practitioners who gave expert evidence at the inquest all agreed that, if David had been kept at Gosnells Medical Clinic after the procedure and monitored appropriately prior to discharge, his deterioration would have been identified and reversal of the developing opioid toxicity could have occurred.\"\n\n\"Dr Hassan failed in his professional duty to take the necessary measures to ensure David's safety. His oversights were inadvertent and he has acknowledged his shortfalls and expressed deep remorse for the catastrophic consequences.\"\n\nThe coroner referred Dr Hassan to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.\n\nDr Hassan continues to practice medicine but no longer performs circumcisions and has relinquished access to morphine.\n\nThe ABC sent questions to Dr Hassan's practice but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\n'Cherished, cheeky son'\n\nCoroner Hartley said after sitting through two days of very difficult evidence, Mr and Mrs Flynn had been \"gracious enough to share an insight into their cherished, cheeky son David\".\n\n\"While a series of photographs of him with his siblings were shown to the Court, Mrs Flynn told us of the special bond David shared with older sister Casmy, older brother Phillip and younger brother Joseph,\" she said.\n\n\"She also gave us the bittersweet news that David now has a younger sister who he will never meet in this life.\n\n\"Mr and Mrs Flynn have been supported through their loss by the Zambian community they know through their church.\n\n\" David will never be forgotten. Nor should the lessons arising out of his death. \"\n\nNoor Blumer represented the Flynn family at the coronial inquest and spoke to the ABC on their behalf.\n\nNoor Blumer says David's family hopes sharing their story will help prevent further tragedies. (Supplied)\n\nShe said Mr and Mrs Flynn wanted to share the story of what had happened to David, and their pain over his loss, with the hope it may prevent others from having to go through the same.\n\n\"They are a very committed Christian family and they are not the kind of people that are vindictive or out to get anybody,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't think there's a good outcome for them, but I think the best outcome will be if there could be an improvement in practises when making circumcisions available.\n\n\"It's really important that circumcision is something that is available to people that want to do it for whatever reasons [religious or otherwise] for their children, in safe circumstances.\"\n\nLoading...",

    "text": "It was the late 1990s, and tech company Intel was looking for social scientists to study how people used technology in their homes. They wanted product ideas \u2013 the plan was to turn experts in human behaviour into technology soothsayers. During Bell\u2019s interview, she warned the company that she was \u201ca radical feminist and an unconstructed neo-Marxist\u201d, The New York Times reported in 2014. Intel was undeterred. It welcomed her forthrightness, which, she told the newspaper, could be a liability in the academic world. \u201cAt Stanford, they didn\u2019t like it when you told the faculty they were dead wrong, whereas here, that was a cultural value,\u201d she said. In 2017, Bell was brought back to Australia by another rock-star scientist, then ANU vice chancellor and Nobel prize-winning physicist Brian Schmidt, to lead a new institution looking at the intersection of artificial intelligence, data and human experience (now known as the School of Cybernetics). ANU\u2019s council, headed by Bishop, appointed her as vice chancellor in September 2023 (VC is the equivalent of a company chief executive). Still, she remained on the Intel payroll until November 2024, 10 months into the top job (she reportedly earned about $70,000 for 24 hours\u2019 work from the company in that time). When her secondary employment was eventually revealed, it took many in the tertiary sector by surprise. \u201cIt was a shocking look,\u201d said an executive at another major institution, on the condition of anonymity so they could speak freely. \u201cBeing a VC is a full-time gig.\u201d \u201cDorothy-red stilettos against a sea of men\u2019s dark shoes\u201d: Julie Bishop\u2019s shoes made a statement when she announced her resignation as foreign affairs minister in August, 2018. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Questions linger about the disclosure of the Intel gig; Bishop has said she approved the paid nature of the arrangement, but ANU then told the Senate that its council did not require members to disclose remuneration when calling for disclosures of interest.\n\nStepping into the VC role wasn\u2019t an easy personal transition for Bell. She\u2019d explained to the Times that she embraced her femininity while working in the masculine computer world by wearing French perfume and high-heeled shoes. But in the first few weeks of her job as vice chancellor, she was told to adjust her image. \u201cShe was advised to fix her wild red hair, to watch her weight, to swap her backpack for a briefcase,\u201d her head of public affairs, Amy Capuano, wrote in a post on LinkedIn, which was posted in response to the sneaker saga. But Bell\u2019s professional challenge was far greater. She took over a university that was in bad financial shape. Before COVID, Schmidt had deliberately kept a lid on student numbers to stop the university from becoming mass-market education like major institutions in Sydney and Melbourne, which were trying to recruit as many international students as they could. The university was also rebuilding ageing infrastructure and fixing the damage caused by a wild weather event in 2018. All this meant that ANU had no financial buffer when the pandemic hit, and the then-Coalition government refused to allow universities to claim JobSeeker payments. Budgets were further eroded by the Coalition\u2019s Job-ready Graduates package, which cut Commonwealth funding for teaching local students across many courses and therefore reduced the viability of smaller courses for many universities, not just ANU \u2013 a policy that Labor has not repealed. Bell also walked into cultural problems. A report on the former ANU College of Health and Medicine by former NSW assistant police commissioner Christine Nixon, published in May, found staff described \u201ca deeply dysfunctional culture across the college and the broader university marked by bureaucracy, territorialism, bullying, entitlement and resistance to change,\u201d it said, adding that the university could not provide an environment of psychological safety while this behaviour was considered acceptable. \u201cYou could argue that she inherited a situation that had been building for a number of years,\u201d says Andrew Norton, a higher education policy expert who worked at ANU until last year and is now at Monash University. \u201cOn the other hand, you\u2019ve got to think of the appointments that council has made; two VCs in a row without extensive prior university administration experience.\u201d\n\nThere remains confusion over the extent of the financial problem at ANU, and how it got so bad. Bell and Bishop say it\u2019s dire; in a statement in late July, Bell said ANU had been operating with a deficit since COVID and last year spent $2.7 million more a week than it earned. The 2024 annual report outlines an operational deficit of $140 million. They say the financial crisis position justifies the plan to cut $250 million from the budget, of which $100 million involved staff cuts; more than 220 people have already left through voluntary or forced redundancies (on Wednesday, Bell said there would be no more forced job cuts). Pocock, however, says the extent of the financial problems remains unclear. \u201cBecause there\u2019s such a lack of transparency, [it\u2019s uncertain] whether the finances actually warrant this level of cuts,\u201d he said. Norton says that if the university\u2019s position is as bad as Bell says, then its council will need to answer questions about how it let it get there. \u201cThis is one of the key issues that TEQSA [Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency] is looking into,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the ANU\u2019s finances are as bad as Bell and Bishop say they are, why wasn\u2019t this issue addressed earlier on? How did [ANU] get into this situation, and being in that situation, did it hire the right people to get it out?\u201d The fury of staff, students and alumni has been inflamed by revelations about the cost of supporting the chancellor, Bishop (chancellor is like a company chair, and works with the vice chancellor on strategy and financial oversight). In 2023, the university spent $186,000 flying Bishop, Schmidt, Bell and three other executives to the World Economic Forum in Davos, where ANU hosted a $78,000 reception. Bishop doesn\u2019t receive a salary for the role (she is entitled to an honorarium of about $75,000), but her costs are significant; her Perth office, travel expenses and staff cost about $790,000 last year, The Australian Financial Review has reported. Bishop has also been accused in the Senate of hiring her former media adviser, friend and business partner Murray Hansen to write her speeches (ANU says this was done by the events team at arm\u2019s length from Bishop).\n\nThe scandal intensified last week when Dr Liz Allen, an ANU demographer and former council member, told a federal committee that Bishop had laughed at and blocked her from leaving a room when confronting her with allegations of leaking confidential information to the media. \u201cI believe chancellor Bishop is hostile and arrogant to staff,\u201d she told the Senate inquiry. Bishop rejected the allegations, saying she always showed staff members respect. Loading Glass cliff position Bishop has been at the university since January 2020, but Bell has been there for only a year and a half. Some say the vice chancellor is being pushed off a \u201cglass cliff\u201d (a descriptor of jobs given to women when there\u2019s barely any possibility of succeeding in them).\n\nBell has described the campaign against her as tall poppy syndrome. \u201cSexism is alive and well and living in Australia,\u201d she told the ABC, pointing out that the campaign has been personal in a way that her male predecessor never experienced. Some agree. In a Canberra Times piece decrying the National Tertiary Education Union\u2019s campaign against her, ANU professor John Blaxland argued that Bell was in an invidious position. \u201cNow is not the time to push beyond the glass cliff,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to recognise the scale of the challenge she faces and get behind her.\u201d But female academics hit back. An opinion piece by anonymous \u201cANU Gender Experts\u201d argues that they have seen no evidence of sexism in the union\u2019s campaign, and that Bell was a privileged woman who was failing in her job. \u201cWomen in powerful positions cannot be immune to criticism, nor should their gender protect them from scrutiny,\u201d they wrote, expressing their frustration \u201cwith what we see as a blatant weaponisation of gender and to raise our voices against it.\u201d Loading Pocock also disagrees with the glass cliff argument. He gave Bell the benefit of the doubt at first, but \u201cthat argument wears very thin when you see the way things are being managed\u201d, he says. \u201cA lot of the issues now are of their own making, clearly under the decision-making of Bishop and Bell and a council that\u2019s potentially been starved of information or hasn\u2019t been willing to stand up to them.\u201d Bishop\u2019s predecessor is unforgiving, too. Gareth Evans, also a former foreign minister, albeit in the Hawke/Keating Labor government (there\u2019s a long history of political alumni as ANU chancellors), wrote to a group of emeritus professors in March, the AFR reported, saying, \u201cNo competence. No judgment. No shame. How much more of this can ANU tolerate?\u201d\n\nThe matter is now in the hands of TEQSA. Its chief executive wrote to Bell in late June, raising issues ranging from a lack of financial transparency to the management of the cuts and concerns that staff were too intimidated by senior executives to speak up about the process. \u201cTEQSA is concerned ANU\u2019s council may not have fulfilled its obligation to exercise competent governance oversight of, and be accountable for, all ANU\u2019s operations,\u201d Dr Mary Russell wrote. In a statement, ANU acknowledged the changes had been challenging and said it had already achieved $59.9 million in savings. \u201cWe know this period of transformation hasn\u2019t been easy and we thank and acknowledge the work and dedication of our community to support ANU during this time of change and continuing to strive for collegial relationships,\u201d it said. In an interview with the Canberra Times in June, Bell said she believed ANU was on the right course. \u201cI was raised to be really clear about why you do things,\u201d she said. \u201cTo believe that your work should make the world different through the dint of your labour.\u201d Bell also discussed the \u201caesthetic pleasure\u201d she found in shoes, with options so much wider than the black or brown for men. \u201cI own a lot of them,\u201d she said \u2013 but \u201cconsiderably less than [Imelda] Marcos\u201d. In Capuano\u2019s LinkedIn defence of her boss last month, as the shoe issue blew up, she wondered why, in 2025, people were still questioning a woman\u2019s decisions about her shoes. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to remember any commentary about the last VC\u2019s choice of footwear.\u201d",

    "text": "\u201cWe\u2019ve recognised the importance of pets in our lives, and other legislation has been changed over the years to reflect that,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Victoria, the rental laws were changed so that renters are allowed to have pets. Aged care or retirement laws have changed, so when people move into aged care, they can bring their pet. Even on the federal level, we\u2019ve changed the Family Law Act \u2013 pets are now recognised as companions, rather than property.\u201d Deb Tranter\u2019s beloved dogs \u2013 Lutana the pug (front), Oscar the poodle cross (left) and Daisy the Yorkshire terrier (back) \u2013 are all buried in her family plot. Tranter is one of a growing number of Victorians who wish to be buried with their pets. Over the six years she has managed a public cemetery, she says she has reopened several family plots to bury beloved cats and dogs. In doing so, she runs the risk of penalties, including fines, for breaching legislation. \u201cPeople are wanting this, so it\u2019s really hard to deny them,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve just made the choice that I\u2019m going to allow it to happen.\u201d\n\nGeorgie Purcell, Animal Justice Party MP and member for Northern Victoria, says other cemetery managers are making the same call, especially as more people \u2013 particularly younger generations and those who don\u2019t have children \u2013 request in their wills that their pets be buried with them. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially because of an old religious belief that at one point said animals don\u2019t have souls. So, countless funeral directors and cemetery managers are faced with an impossible decision every day of either honouring someone\u2019s dying wish or breaking the law. Most of them are choosing to break the law,\u201d Purcell says. In June, the NSW government passed changes to the state\u2019s Cemeteries and Crematoria Act to clarify that the remains of deceased companion animals may be placed with their late humans\u2019 remains. Purcell hopes this will set some kind of precedent for the rest of Australia. The Prime Minister (pictured with his dog Toto) thinks it\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d to allow people to be buried with their pets. Credit: AP When approached by this masthead, a Victorian government spokesperson said it \u201cunderstands the important role pets play in people\u2019s lives\u201d and that some Australians wish to be buried with them upon death.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to listen to advocacy and views on this issue.\u201d Purcell first raised this issue with the Victorian Parliament last September, and has multiple times since. But so far, she says no concrete action has been taken. Though it only requires a small amendment, Purcell says the reluctance could be that this change would reveal a broader need for reform across the Cemeteries Act. \u201cIt just goes to show how silly we look that this has come to the government\u2019s attention, and they haven\u2019t done anything about it. Every single person who finds out this isn\u2019t allowed is shocked by it, including the prime minister.\u201d Georgie Purcell and her late dog Greta, who is now kept in an urn. Amending the law wouldn\u2019t just help emotionally, but also logistically. Tranter says she has to note the details of every internment, including how deep and where all remains are buried. But since pet co-burials are illegal, they\u2019re omitted from the record.\n\nLoading \u201cI want to be able to legally record these pet burials, and their position in the grave so we\u2019re not going to be disturbing the remains if we need to reopen that grave.\u201d Chief executive of the Australasian Cemeteries and Crematoria Association Ben Kelly says the current Victorian Act should be revised if there is genuine public demand. However, he cautions those who want to be buried with their pets to consider the logistics. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between placing ashes of a dog into a grave, and placing a dog\u2019s remains,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cWill the dog go into a coffin or straight into a grave? And if the owner dies before the pet, make sure you\u2019re not euthanising the pet to then go into the grave.\u201d Then there are the issues of cost and space. It could cost anywhere between a hundred and thousands of dollars to place the ashes of a pet into a plot, and if a pet takes up one spot, it could mean another family member forfeits.",

    "text": "Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn said the banks\u2019 data showed younger generations had lifted their spending and saving. Credit: AFR \u201cBad debts have stayed extremely low,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Nathan Zaia, though he noted NAB bucked the trend with slightly higher bad debts in the June quarter. This could be a quarterly blip, or it might show small businesses (NAB\u2019s key customer base) are feeling the pain more than households. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) chair John Lonsdale also said this week the broad trend in credit quality had been \u201cprobably as good as we could have hoped\u201d, given rises in interest rates between 2022 and 2023. \u201cThe arrears figures, the delinquencies, and ultimately the non-performing loans have held up incredibly well over a rising and now falling interest rate environment,\u201d Lonsdale said. Rate cuts fuel mortgage growth\n\nInterest rate cuts are not only giving indebted customers more breathing space \u2013 they are also boosting the housing market. And as house prices rise, it tends to lift credit growth. CBA said in its result that it expected housing credit growth of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent this financial year, and its presentation also noted customers\u2019 borrowing capacity had risen thanks to tax changes that came into effect in July last year. Loading ANZ economists, separately from any results, have noted that the latest June quarter was the strongest quarter for housing credit growth since 2022, and they expect housing credit will accelerate and overtake business credit growth in the year ahead. ANZ forecasts housing credit growth will hit 8.2 per cent by the end of 2026, compared with 5.9 per cent now. Markets expect the Reserve Bank will make two more rate cuts over the next year, and Morningstar\u2019s Zaia says that could help to encourage growth in lending to property investors. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got some more cash rate cuts, that should be a positive for investor sentiment.\u201d\n\nAPRA this week said further rate cuts could add to the risk in banks\u2019 mortgage portfolios, as in the past lower interest rates had fuelled higher leverage, house price growth, and often, riskier lending by banks. It will keep a close eye on these risks. The contest with mortgage brokers continues Mortgage brokers have had a phenomenal rise since the 1990s and now write about three-quarters of all new home loans in Australia. Banks are openly trying to fight back, and many are employing more bankers to arrange loans. But given the key role of brokers in the market, it is a delicate balancing act. CBA, which is much less reliant on brokers than rivals, repeatedly highlighted that it wants to do more lending in-house, and it kept the share of loans that were written in-house steady at 54 per cent. Westpac\u2019s trading update showed 46 per cent of loans were written by its own staff, down from 48.7 per cent a year ago, and from 46.6 per cent in March. The bank is hiring 180 new bankers and this area is a key priority for chief executive Anthony Miller.\n\nThe major banks have about $1.8 trillion in mortgages \u2013 their biggest asset. Credit: Peter Rae NAB\u2019s Andrew Irvine said it had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in its in-house lending \u2013 one of the top priorities he outlined for the bank in May. It\u2019s not clear what ANZ\u2019s new chief, Nuno Matos, may be planning for the bank\u2019s use of mortgage brokers, who accounted for two-thirds of its new lending in the latest half. Market observers are watching the issue closely, but many, such as Jarden\u2019s Matt Wilson, believe it will be difficult to reverse the long-term move by customers towards mortgage brokers. \u201cWhilst we applaud the efforts by the CBA and NAB, in particular, to win back the third-party distribution margin in search of better shareholder returns, we think it\u2019s akin to trying to put toothpaste back in the tube,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nIs the CBA \u2018bubble\u2019 deflating? The big question for many investors \u2013 including the people managing our superannuation \u2013 is what all this means for share prices. Loading CBA is the biggest company on the ASX, worth $290 billion after a rally of more than 25 per cent over the past year. The big four combined are worth almost a quarter of the entire ASX 200, and there\u2019s long been a debate about whether Australian bank shares (especially CBA) are overvalued. The violent market reaction to CBA\u2019s largely as-expected result helped reignite this discussion, as analysts questioned if there could be more falls to come for the country\u2019s biggest bank.",

    "text": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers doubled down on a promise this week to conduct another review into artificial intelligence (AI) regulation, to determine whether the technology needs new laws or can fit into existing ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will accelerate a national development plan around how Australians can use the technology, Chalmers said at the government's productivity roundtable on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI could boost Australia's labour productivity by more than 4 per cent, but an expert warns the benefits may not be shared evenly, as Australia's peers around the world navigate the same challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) secretary Sally McManus said at the economic summit she was not calling for \"over-regulating\" AI, but argued for a worker-centric approach to rolling out the transformative technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of AI proved a major dividing line between employers and unions heading into the talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACTU called for the government to force employers to consult with staff before introducing new AI tools, while business groups warned that additional regulation could stifle adoption and reduce productivity gains.\n\n\n\nIn a major development, unions and the tech sector struck a deal to design a model that would see Australian creatives paid for their work when it is used to train AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcManus described the agreement with Tech Council chairman Scott Farquhar as a \"breakthrough\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's agreement that we\u2019re going to give this a real good go at coming up with a model that makes sure that people are actually paid for what they produce. So that\u2019s a big thing,\" McManus said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness leaders also acknowledged that the risks of AI extend beyond job losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I made the point that there\u2019s risk not just for workers. Business owners are looking at their own future or extinction,\" said Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox.\n\n\n\nA Productivity Commission report released earlier this month estimated AI could add $116 billion to Australia\u2019s economy over the next decade, but only if the government avoids stifling the technology with heavy-handed regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has previously said it's working with industry to develop a National AI Capability Plan due by the end of the year, which will set out how to boost investment, grow industry capability, improve AI skills, including retraining workers.\n\n\n\nAustralia's cautious approach\n\nThe Productivity Commission has recommended the government hold off on introducing new AI-specific laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, it says existing frameworks such as consumer protection, privacy, and anti-discrimination laws should be adapted first.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to its Harnessing Data and Digital Technology interim report, the commission states AI-specific regulations should only be considered as a last resort.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also urges the government to pause its work on mandatory guardrails for high-risk AI until these gaps in existing law are fully understood.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt further stresses specific regulation should only be introduced if those frameworks cannot be adapted and if technology-neutral approaches are not workable.\n\n\n\nThe 'high stakes' of AI\n\nAccording to the report, AI has the potential to lift labour productivity growth by 4.3 per cent over the next decade, but experts caution the benefits may be uneven, and warn that sidelining human oversight could undermine good governance.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Popovski, AI policy and advocacy lead at the Governance Institute of Australia, told SBS News the stakes are high with the rise of so-called 'agentic AI' \u2014 autonomous systems that act with little human oversight.\n\n\n\n\"Agentic AI is not just about producing content like chatbots do. These are autonomous systems run on very little human oversight. That raises new and urgent questions about accountability, transparency, and workplace governance that cannot be ignored,\" Popovski said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopovski said the conversation around AI is too often framed as one of job losses, overlooking its growth potential \u2014 provided there is a clear strategy in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In reality, there is enormous potential for growth and augmentation if the transition is managed well. The challenge is making sure Australians are prepared and supported through these changes so that AI works for people, not against them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We need a national AI strategy that sets out how the government will manage these challenges and opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Good governance should be human-centric. It should support organisations that adopt AI responsibly and make sure the gains flow to all workers,\" Popovski said.\n\n\n\nHow the global landscape compares\n\nAround the world, governments are taking different paths to manage the rise of AI. Some are prioritising protections for workers through up-skilling, while others are moving ahead with binding rules.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina is pushing for global cooperation, and the United Kingdom and New Zealand are aligning oversight with existing laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US AI action plan directs its labour department to fund rapid retraining for workers who lose jobs due to AI and to guide states on upskilling workers at risk of future displacement.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU is proceeding with the AI Act. Obligations for general-purpose AI models started on 2 August, with high-risk system requirements due in August 2026. A voluntary code of practice is already available to help companies prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the 2025 World AI Conference in Shanghai, China released a Global AI Governance Action Plan that calls for stronger international cooperation, inclusiveness and attention to environmental sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK government has said it will consult the public on AI legislation and is aiming for a proportionate approach that works with existing laws, following its pro-innovation framework.\n\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand has published its first national AI strategy. It aligns with OECD principles and encourages responsible use while aiming to accelerate private sector adoption and innovation.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Katie Koullas worries her two autistic daughters will lose vital support under planned changes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government will divert people with what it calls \"mild to moderate\" autism into a new program, Thriving Kids, starting in July 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly those with \"permanent and significant\" autism will remain eligible for the NDIS, Health Minister Mark Butler said when announcing the plan this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoullas, who runs Yellow Ladybugs \u2014 a charity for autistic girls, women and gender-diverse people \u2014 said she was \"surprised\" and \"heartbroken\" by the announcement.\n\n\n\n\"One of the biggest risks is that this announcement divides our community,\" Koullas told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's turning us against each other to prove our need for support. That's really dangerous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm autistic and I've got two autistic teen girls. We would be considered mild as per the minister's statements, but what's damaging about that is that our experience isn't mild at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKoullas says the NDIS has provided her family with reliable, individualised support. She fears the new program could mean losing that \u2014 with damaging consequences.\n\n\n\n'No such thing as mild autism'\n\nButler argues the NDIS was never intended to cover children with \"mild to moderate\" autism, but has become the \"only port in the storm\" for families with no other options.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the new program will provide a \"broad-based mainstream system of supports\" for those children, while those with more significant needs will stay on the NDIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Koullos says language like \"mild\" is harmful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mild doesn't actually exist as a clinical term. It's quite damaging because it invalidates experiences,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone's needs fluctuate. We're not saying everyone has the same needs, but grouping people in terms of 'mild' really dismisses those internal struggles or those hidden needs that often get unmet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've fought so hard to try and change the narrative around the autistic experience, and I fear this is taking a massive step backwards.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Thriving Kids: The plan to move children with autism and developmental delays off NDIS\n\nThe announcement also comes just months after the federal government released Australia's first national autism strategy , committing $42.3 million towards implementing the first phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens senator Jordon Steele-John called the move \"deeply shameful\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Autistic Australians are being used as a political football, and that is simply unacceptable,\" Steele-John said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Autism is lifelong. There is no growing out of it. The Minister's suggestion otherwise denies reality and risks stripping people of the supports they need to thrive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe accused the government of using labels \u2014 like \"mild\" and \"moderate \u2014 that have \"no clinical basis\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition health spokesperson Anne Ruston said \"there needs to be more detail\" announced about Butler's plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nButler has said the changes will help rein in NDIS costs, which are projected to reach $52 billion in 2025/26.\n\n\n\nThe federal government released its first national autism strategy in January. Source: AAP / Darren England\n\nConcerns about 'one size fits all'\n\nThe exact design of Thriving Kids is unclear, though some have suggested it could resemble other programs such as Inklings, which operates in South Australia and Western Australia. The program is aimed at babies aged 6 to 18 months who show early differences in communication development and offers 10 sessions every six months with a practitioner.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicare items for occupational therapy, speech pathology and psychosocial therapy would be considered for the Thriving Kids program, including a bulk-billed check-up for three-year-olds, Butler said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoullas worries such a model would replace the choice and flexibility families now have with the NDIS. \"The NDIS is around choice and control and ongoing relationships,\" she said. \"This is a one-size-fits-all approach that is not customised, it hasn't had any autistic input or approval.\"\n\n\n\nThrough the NDIS, autistic people are able to access a range of support \u2014 including support workers, peer programs that links other autistic people together based on their interest areas, music and art therapy, or support to take autistic people out into the community (like shopping centres) to foster independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Perhaps there are some cohorts that may benefit from it, but we haven't had enough information to understand what that nuance is. To be making these announcements without any reassurance for the community, to our people, is damaging and scary.\"\n\n\n\nLimited consultation\n\nButler expects states and territories to collectively match his $2 billion funding pledge, but state politicians, including Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan and WA Disability Services Minister Hannah Beazley, said they learned about the plan from Butler's press conference. NSW Premier Chris Minns warned he would not \"sign a blank cheque\" without further detail.\n\n\n\n\n\nJenny Karavolos, co-chair of the Australian Autism Alliance, said the lack of consultation was concerning. She said the program appeared to be a version of targeted foundation reports, which saw some consultations late last year, but was surprised the health minister launched a specific program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We haven't had any consultation, so we're a little concerned about what this actually means for autistic children and their families,\" Karavolos told SBS News.\n\n\n\nHowever, she remains \"cautiously optimistic\" given Butler's commitment to co-design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're understanding that this is in concept stage and the reason we're cautiously optimistic is that there has been a commitment that there will be time to consult and develop and design this properly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nButler has assured families that no one will fall through the cracks, saying no one would be taken off the NDIS without being moved to the new program. But Karavolos is still concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need an integrated and interconnected disability ecosystem \u2026 there are gaps and people bounce from system to system,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of course, there are disappointments, but we will continue to advocate until we get that world where not only autistic people, but all people with disabilities, are enabled so they can get great outcomes and live a life they deserve.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA joint statement from disability representative organisations including Disability Australia and Physical Disability Australia said they were \"heartened\" by the NDIS changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, they also expressed disappointment \"that the government chose not to engage with the disability community about their announcement\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement said: \"The announcements made by the Minister came as a surprise to the disability community and representative organisations. This has created further uncertainty for our community.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The federal government's economic roundtable has finished, after three days of talks at Parliament House involving economists, employers, business groups, unions and civil society representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discussions were aimed at lifting living standards, primarily by boosting productivity , which has stagnated in Australia and other Western countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSectors represented included banking, universities, mining and superannuation, and topics discussed included artificial intelligence and building and construction. Here are some of the key takeaways.\n\n\n\nA 'constructive' mood and an address from the prime minister\n\nWhile the discussions held around the table themselves were shrouded in secrecy \u2014 with attendees not even allowed to bring mobile phones into the cabinet room \u2014 Tuesday was a \"promising and productive first day\", according to Treasurer Jim Chalmers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese promised to strive for consensus to achieve long-lasting change during his opening address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Political change, whether it's in the economy, social policy or the environment, is likely to be more successful and more entrenched and more lasting when people come with us on that journey,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\nAmong the topics discussed on the opening day was developing the skillset of Australia's workforce . Participants recognised businesses needed to play a role in training their workers, but there was division on how to incentivise employers to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Bran Black said unions had proposed charging employers a levy to provide skills, but businesses preferred an incentive for employers to bring on more apprentices.\n\n\n\n'Win-wins' over cutting red tape on housing, environment\n\nSimplifying the regulation of housing approvals garnered widespread support on day two of the roundtable on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe treasurer promised \"win-wins\" over cutting red tape, with businesses and unions seemingly on the same page on the issue.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What is the economic reform roundtable and what will it achieve?\n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil garnered broad support for a proposed pause to the National Construction Code for the life of the housing accord, which runs until mid-2029 and sets a target for 1.2 million new homes. A pause is largely aimed a speeding up construction times.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to the code that deal with safety issues, such as fireproofing, would be exempt from a pause. But a broader rewrite was also possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster Builders Australia has been pushing for a review into \"non-essential\" changes, including EV charging requirements, which they argue increase the cost and complexity of building new homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) president Michele O'Neil said it was important to keep improving the energy efficiency of new homes, but acknowledged the nearly 3,000-page document was \"clunky\", and called for more support for modular housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all were on board with the pause. Australian Council of Social Service chief executive Cassandra Goldie was concerned about it leading to poorer housing quality.\n\n\n\nThere was also support for reforming the Howard-era Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnions, employer groups and environmentalists all said the act was no longer fit for purpose and pressed for a new act that provides faster decisions for projects from mining to housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Conservation Foundation chief executive Kelly O'Shanassy said there was consensus on the government's commitment to create a national environment protection agency (EPA), but the \"devil is in the detail\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile business groups want the EPA to only deal with compliance and not project approvals, O'Shanassy said Australia needs an independent regulator that is held to account for the speed and quality of its decisions.\n\n\n\nIndependent MP Allegra Spender (left) said there was agreement around the need to train workers to adapt to the changing economy. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\nBreakthrough model for artificial intelligence\n\nAustralia's tech sector and unions will work together on a model that pays creatives for content used to train artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nACTU secretary Sally McManus said the peak union body reached a breakthrough with Tech Council chairman Scott Farquhar at the roundtable late on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's agreement that we're going to give this a real good go at coming up with a model that makes sure that people are actually paid for what they produce. So that's a big thing,\" McManus told reporters on the sidelines of the summit in Parliament House on Thursday.\n\n\n\nConversations around technology and artificial intelligence featured in the talks from day one, with independent MP Allegra Spender saying there was agreement around the need to train workers to adapt to the changing economy, including in using AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of AI was a major dividing line between employers and unions heading into the roundtable, with the ACTU calling for the government to force employers to consult with staff before introducing AI tools to the workplace.\n\n\n\nThe Finance Sector Union has also called for a \"just digital transition\" to protect white collar workers from being replaced by AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe union claimed victory on Thursday after Commonwealth Bank backflipped on a decision to make 45 call centre jobs redundant due to the introduction of a new AI-powered voice bot which the bank claimed would cut call volumes.\n\n\n\nTax and intergenerational inequality\n\nThe final day of the summit on Thursday focused on tax reform and budget sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government went into the federal election in May promising not to make changes to negative gearing and the capital gains benefit, but forum attendees argued for reforms.\n\n\n\nDale Boccabella, an associate professor of tax law at the University of New South Wales, said capital gains and negative gearing reform needed to be considered by the government to take to voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Aspects of the tax system is just unfair and the big one is the capital gains tax discount,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you look at who gets the benefits, it goes to the top end, they don't need a 50 per cent tax break.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoccabella said sustainability of the tax system needed to be front and centre during the final day of the roundtable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sustainability and fairness go hand in hand, and underlying that, of course, is generational unfairness,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the roundtable, Chalmers said the attendees took their \"inter-generational responsibilities\" seriously and that the talks gave Australia a \"much better chance\" of confronting challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nA brief clash\n\nWhile Chalmers said there had mostly been goodwill and congeniality between participants of the roundtable, there was a clash between the Treasurer and Opposition treasury spokesperson Ted O'Brien on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a session on efficient government spending, O'Brien accused the government of lacking fiscal restraint. \"I set a test for the treasurer today to stop the spending spree, which starts with the introduction of quantifiable fiscal rules,\" the lone Opposition representative said during a break.\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Brien called for the government to put a roof on public spending, set time-bound targets to reduce red tape and conduct a total system cost analysis of the energy system.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The University of Melbourne has been found to have breached Victoria's privacy laws by using information to track students involved in a 2024 pro-Palestinian protest.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the state's deputy information commissioner, the university has breached two information privacy principles (IPPs) in the way it used \"a combination of student Wi-Fi location data, student card photographs and CCTV footage to identify\" student protesters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because the collection and use of the data involved the surveillance of students and staff, and surveillance by its nature is antithetical to human rights, the breach was serious,\" the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner (OVIC) stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Katerina Kapobassis, the University of Melbourne's chief operating officer, said the university \"acknowledges that it could have provided clearer active notice to students and staff members in relation to the use of WiFi location data, and a number of remedial actions are progressing\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian students walk out of class, calling for sanctions on Israel\n\nHow did the investigation start?\n\nFollowing a sit-in protest at the university's Arts West Building on the Parkville campus in May last year, the university's vice-chancellor instructed everyone occupying the building to leave the premises.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to OVIC's report, some demonstrators ignored the direction, resulting in the university starting an investigation into potential student misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe university identified 20 students and started misconduct proceedings against them.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter media reports in July 2024 revealed the university had tracked protesters using CCTV and Wi-Fi data, the Privacy and Data Protection deputy commissioner launched the investigation.\n\n\n\nAccording to the OVIC's report, the university identified staff involvement in the protest through an analysis of Wi-Fi location data, CCTV footage, and a review of 10 staff members' email accounts. Source: AAP / James Ross\n\nWhat did the investigation find?\n\nThe investigation focused on the university's \"use of staff and students' Wi-Fi location data, and was expanded to include the university's review of a small group of staff members' email accounts\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation found the university \"contravened\" two different IPPs when using the Wi-Fi data.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the number of people impacted and the level of the impact, the deputy commissioner determined the breaches were \"serious\".\n\n\n\nThe privacy principles were about whether the university \"properly informed students and staff about how their personal information would be used\" and if the use of data was \"consistent with the primary purpose of collecting this information or was for an authorised secondary purpose\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation, however, did not find any breaches in relation to staff email accounts.\n\n\n\nWhat did the university say?\n\nKapobassis said in a statement that the university \"takes its privacy obligations seriously and has cooperated openly and responsively to the deputy commissioner in the conduct of her investigation\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile acknowledging the university could have provided clearer notice, she said \"the use of WiFi location data in student misconduct cases was reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The university has already completed a number of actions that are proposed in the final report, and all others are progressing. We will ensure the university community is kept informed as these changes are made.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "It was the late 1990s, and tech company Intel was looking for social scientists to study how people used technology in their homes. They wanted product ideas \u2013 the plan was to turn experts in human behaviour into technology soothsayers. During Bell\u2019s interview, she warned the company that she was \u201ca radical feminist and an unconstructed neo-Marxist\u201d, The New York Times reported in 2014. Intel was undeterred. It welcomed her forthrightness, which, she told the newspaper, could be a liability in the academic world. \u201cAt Stanford, they didn\u2019t like it when you told the faculty they were dead wrong, whereas here, that was a cultural value,\u201d she said. In 2017, Bell was brought back to Australia by another rock-star scientist, then ANU vice chancellor and Nobel prize-winning physicist Brian Schmidt, to lead a new institution looking at the intersection of artificial intelligence, data and human experience (now known as the School of Cybernetics). ANU\u2019s council, headed by Bishop, appointed her as vice chancellor in September 2023 (VC is the equivalent of a company chief executive). Still, she remained on the Intel payroll until November 2024, 10 months into the top job (she reportedly earned about $70,000 for 24 hours\u2019 work from the company in that time). When her secondary employment was eventually revealed, it took many in the tertiary sector by surprise. \u201cIt was a shocking look,\u201d said an executive at another major institution, on the condition of anonymity so they could speak freely. \u201cBeing a VC is a full-time gig.\u201d \u201cDorothy-red stilettos against a sea of men\u2019s dark shoes\u201d: Julie Bishop\u2019s shoes made a statement when she announced her resignation as foreign affairs minister in August, 2018. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Questions linger about the disclosure of the Intel gig; Bishop has said she approved the paid nature of the arrangement, but ANU then told the Senate that its council did not require members to disclose remuneration when calling for disclosures of interest.\n\nStepping into the VC role wasn\u2019t an easy personal transition for Bell. She\u2019d explained to the Times that she embraced her femininity while working in the masculine computer world by wearing French perfume and high-heeled shoes. But in the first few weeks of her job as vice chancellor, she was told to adjust her image. \u201cShe was advised to fix her wild red hair, to watch her weight, to swap her backpack for a briefcase,\u201d her head of public affairs, Amy Capuano, wrote in a post on LinkedIn, which was posted in response to the sneaker saga. But Bell\u2019s professional challenge was far greater. She took over a university that was in bad financial shape. Before COVID, Schmidt had deliberately kept a lid on student numbers to stop the university from becoming mass-market education like major institutions in Sydney and Melbourne, which were trying to recruit as many international students as they could. The university was also rebuilding ageing infrastructure and fixing the damage caused by a wild weather event in 2018. All this meant that ANU had no financial buffer when the pandemic hit, and the then-Coalition government refused to allow universities to claim JobSeeker payments. Budgets were further eroded by the Coalition\u2019s Job-ready Graduates package, which cut Commonwealth funding for teaching local students across many courses and therefore reduced the viability of smaller courses for many universities, not just ANU \u2013 a policy that Labor has not repealed. Bell also walked into cultural problems. A report on the former ANU College of Health and Medicine by former NSW assistant police commissioner Christine Nixon, published in May, found staff described \u201ca deeply dysfunctional culture across the college and the broader university marked by bureaucracy, territorialism, bullying, entitlement and resistance to change,\u201d it said, adding that the university could not provide an environment of psychological safety while this behaviour was considered acceptable. \u201cYou could argue that she inherited a situation that had been building for a number of years,\u201d says Andrew Norton, a higher education policy expert who worked at ANU until last year and is now at Monash University. \u201cOn the other hand, you\u2019ve got to think of the appointments that council has made; two VCs in a row without extensive prior university administration experience.\u201d\n\nThere remains confusion over the extent of the financial problem at ANU, and how it got so bad. Bell and Bishop say it\u2019s dire; in a statement in late July, Bell said ANU had been operating with a deficit since COVID and last year spent $2.7 million more a week than it earned. The 2024 annual report outlines an operational deficit of $140 million. They say the financial crisis position justifies the plan to cut $250 million from the budget, of which $100 million involved staff cuts; more than 220 people have already left through voluntary or forced redundancies (on Wednesday, Bell said there would be no more forced job cuts). Pocock, however, says the extent of the financial problems remains unclear. \u201cBecause there\u2019s such a lack of transparency, [it\u2019s uncertain] whether the finances actually warrant this level of cuts,\u201d he said. Norton says that if the university\u2019s position is as bad as Bell says, then its council will need to answer questions about how it let it get there. \u201cThis is one of the key issues that TEQSA [Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency] is looking into,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the ANU\u2019s finances are as bad as Bell and Bishop say they are, why wasn\u2019t this issue addressed earlier on? How did [ANU] get into this situation, and being in that situation, did it hire the right people to get it out?\u201d The fury of staff, students and alumni has been inflamed by revelations about the cost of supporting the chancellor, Bishop (chancellor is like a company chair, and works with the vice chancellor on strategy and financial oversight). In 2023, the university spent $186,000 flying Bishop, Schmidt, Bell and three other executives to the World Economic Forum in Davos, where ANU hosted a $78,000 reception. Bishop doesn\u2019t receive a salary for the role (she is entitled to an honorarium of about $75,000), but her costs are significant; her Perth office, travel expenses and staff cost about $790,000 last year, The Australian Financial Review has reported. Bishop has also been accused in the Senate of hiring her former media adviser, friend and business partner Murray Hansen to write her speeches (ANU says this was done by the events team at arm\u2019s length from Bishop).\n\nThe scandal intensified last week when Dr Liz Allen, an ANU demographer and former council member, told a federal committee that Bishop had laughed at and blocked her from leaving a room when confronting her with allegations of leaking confidential information to the media. \u201cI believe chancellor Bishop is hostile and arrogant to staff,\u201d she told the Senate inquiry. Bishop rejected the allegations, saying she always showed staff members respect. Loading Glass cliff position Bishop has been at the university since January 2020, but Bell has been there for only a year and a half. Some say the vice chancellor is being pushed off a \u201cglass cliff\u201d (a descriptor of jobs given to women when there\u2019s barely any possibility of succeeding in them).\n\nBell has described the campaign against her as tall poppy syndrome. \u201cSexism is alive and well and living in Australia,\u201d she told the ABC, pointing out that the campaign has been personal in a way that her male predecessor never experienced. Some agree. In a Canberra Times piece decrying the National Tertiary Education Union\u2019s campaign against her, ANU professor John Blaxland argued that Bell was in an invidious position. \u201cNow is not the time to push beyond the glass cliff,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to recognise the scale of the challenge she faces and get behind her.\u201d But female academics hit back. An opinion piece by anonymous \u201cANU Gender Experts\u201d argues that they have seen no evidence of sexism in the union\u2019s campaign, and that Bell was a privileged woman who was failing in her job. \u201cWomen in powerful positions cannot be immune to criticism, nor should their gender protect them from scrutiny,\u201d they wrote, expressing their frustration \u201cwith what we see as a blatant weaponisation of gender and to raise our voices against it.\u201d Loading Pocock also disagrees with the glass cliff argument. He gave Bell the benefit of the doubt at first, but \u201cthat argument wears very thin when you see the way things are being managed\u201d, he says. \u201cA lot of the issues now are of their own making, clearly under the decision-making of Bishop and Bell and a council that\u2019s potentially been starved of information or hasn\u2019t been willing to stand up to them.\u201d Bishop\u2019s predecessor is unforgiving, too. Gareth Evans, also a former foreign minister, albeit in the Hawke/Keating Labor government (there\u2019s a long history of political alumni as ANU chancellors), wrote to a group of emeritus professors in March, the AFR reported, saying, \u201cNo competence. No judgment. No shame. How much more of this can ANU tolerate?\u201d\n\nThe matter is now in the hands of TEQSA. Its chief executive wrote to Bell in late June, raising issues ranging from a lack of financial transparency to the management of the cuts and concerns that staff were too intimidated by senior executives to speak up about the process. \u201cTEQSA is concerned ANU\u2019s council may not have fulfilled its obligation to exercise competent governance oversight of, and be accountable for, all ANU\u2019s operations,\u201d Dr Mary Russell wrote. In a statement, ANU acknowledged the changes had been challenging and said it had already achieved $59.9 million in savings. \u201cWe know this period of transformation hasn\u2019t been easy and we thank and acknowledge the work and dedication of our community to support ANU during this time of change and continuing to strive for collegial relationships,\u201d it said. In an interview with the Canberra Times in June, Bell said she believed ANU was on the right course. \u201cI was raised to be really clear about why you do things,\u201d she said. \u201cTo believe that your work should make the world different through the dint of your labour.\u201d Bell also discussed the \u201caesthetic pleasure\u201d she found in shoes, with options so much wider than the black or brown for men. \u201cI own a lot of them,\u201d she said \u2013 but \u201cconsiderably less than [Imelda] Marcos\u201d. In Capuano\u2019s LinkedIn defence of her boss last month, as the shoe issue blew up, she wondered why, in 2025, people were still questioning a woman\u2019s decisions about her shoes. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to remember any commentary about the last VC\u2019s choice of footwear.\u201d",

    "text": "\u201cWe\u2019ve recognised the importance of pets in our lives, and other legislation has been changed over the years to reflect that,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Victoria, the rental laws were changed so that renters are allowed to have pets. Aged care or retirement laws have changed, so when people move into aged care, they can bring their pet. Even on the federal level, we\u2019ve changed the Family Law Act \u2013 pets are now recognised as companions, rather than property.\u201d Deb Tranter\u2019s beloved dogs \u2013 Lutana the pug (front), Oscar the poodle cross (left) and Daisy the Yorkshire terrier (back) \u2013 are all buried in her family plot. Tranter is one of a growing number of Victorians who wish to be buried with their pets. Over the six years she has managed a public cemetery, she says she has reopened several family plots to bury beloved cats and dogs. In doing so, she runs the risk of penalties, including fines, for breaching legislation. \u201cPeople are wanting this, so it\u2019s really hard to deny them,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve just made the choice that I\u2019m going to allow it to happen.\u201d\n\nGeorgie Purcell, Animal Justice Party MP and member for Northern Victoria, says other cemetery managers are making the same call, especially as more people \u2013 particularly younger generations and those who don\u2019t have children \u2013 request in their wills that their pets be buried with them. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially because of an old religious belief that at one point said animals don\u2019t have souls. So, countless funeral directors and cemetery managers are faced with an impossible decision every day of either honouring someone\u2019s dying wish or breaking the law. Most of them are choosing to break the law,\u201d Purcell says. In June, the NSW government passed changes to the state\u2019s Cemeteries and Crematoria Act to clarify that the remains of deceased companion animals may be placed with their late humans\u2019 remains. Purcell hopes this will set some kind of precedent for the rest of Australia. The Prime Minister (pictured with his dog Toto) thinks it\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d to allow people to be buried with their pets. Credit: AP When approached by this masthead, a Victorian government spokesperson said it \u201cunderstands the important role pets play in people\u2019s lives\u201d and that some Australians wish to be buried with them upon death.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to listen to advocacy and views on this issue.\u201d Purcell first raised this issue with the Victorian Parliament last September, and has multiple times since. But so far, she says no concrete action has been taken. Though it only requires a small amendment, Purcell says the reluctance could be that this change would reveal a broader need for reform across the Cemeteries Act. \u201cIt just goes to show how silly we look that this has come to the government\u2019s attention, and they haven\u2019t done anything about it. Every single person who finds out this isn\u2019t allowed is shocked by it, including the prime minister.\u201d Georgie Purcell and her late dog Greta, who is now kept in an urn. Amending the law wouldn\u2019t just help emotionally, but also logistically. Tranter says she has to note the details of every internment, including how deep and where all remains are buried. But since pet co-burials are illegal, they\u2019re omitted from the record.\n\nLoading \u201cI want to be able to legally record these pet burials, and their position in the grave so we\u2019re not going to be disturbing the remains if we need to reopen that grave.\u201d Chief executive of the Australasian Cemeteries and Crematoria Association Ben Kelly says the current Victorian Act should be revised if there is genuine public demand. However, he cautions those who want to be buried with their pets to consider the logistics. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between placing ashes of a dog into a grave, and placing a dog\u2019s remains,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cWill the dog go into a coffin or straight into a grave? And if the owner dies before the pet, make sure you\u2019re not euthanising the pet to then go into the grave.\u201d Then there are the issues of cost and space. It could cost anywhere between a hundred and thousands of dollars to place the ashes of a pet into a plot, and if a pet takes up one spot, it could mean another family member forfeits.",

    "text": "Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn said the banks\u2019 data showed younger generations had lifted their spending and saving. Credit: AFR \u201cBad debts have stayed extremely low,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Nathan Zaia, though he noted NAB bucked the trend with slightly higher bad debts in the June quarter. This could be a quarterly blip, or it might show small businesses (NAB\u2019s key customer base) are feeling the pain more than households. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) chair John Lonsdale also said this week the broad trend in credit quality had been \u201cprobably as good as we could have hoped\u201d, given rises in interest rates between 2022 and 2023. \u201cThe arrears figures, the delinquencies, and ultimately the non-performing loans have held up incredibly well over a rising and now falling interest rate environment,\u201d Lonsdale said. Rate cuts fuel mortgage growth\n\nInterest rate cuts are not only giving indebted customers more breathing space \u2013 they are also boosting the housing market. And as house prices rise, it tends to lift credit growth. CBA said in its result that it expected housing credit growth of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent this financial year, and its presentation also noted customers\u2019 borrowing capacity had risen thanks to tax changes that came into effect in July last year. Loading ANZ economists, separately from any results, have noted that the latest June quarter was the strongest quarter for housing credit growth since 2022, and they expect housing credit will accelerate and overtake business credit growth in the year ahead. ANZ forecasts housing credit growth will hit 8.2 per cent by the end of 2026, compared with 5.9 per cent now. Markets expect the Reserve Bank will make two more rate cuts over the next year, and Morningstar\u2019s Zaia says that could help to encourage growth in lending to property investors. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got some more cash rate cuts, that should be a positive for investor sentiment.\u201d\n\nAPRA this week said further rate cuts could add to the risk in banks\u2019 mortgage portfolios, as in the past lower interest rates had fuelled higher leverage, house price growth, and often, riskier lending by banks. It will keep a close eye on these risks. The contest with mortgage brokers continues Mortgage brokers have had a phenomenal rise since the 1990s and now write about three-quarters of all new home loans in Australia. Banks are openly trying to fight back, and many are employing more bankers to arrange loans. But given the key role of brokers in the market, it is a delicate balancing act. CBA, which is much less reliant on brokers than rivals, repeatedly highlighted that it wants to do more lending in-house, and it kept the share of loans that were written in-house steady at 54 per cent. Westpac\u2019s trading update showed 46 per cent of loans were written by its own staff, down from 48.7 per cent a year ago, and from 46.6 per cent in March. The bank is hiring 180 new bankers and this area is a key priority for chief executive Anthony Miller.\n\nThe major banks have about $1.8 trillion in mortgages \u2013 their biggest asset. Credit: Peter Rae NAB\u2019s Andrew Irvine said it had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in its in-house lending \u2013 one of the top priorities he outlined for the bank in May. It\u2019s not clear what ANZ\u2019s new chief, Nuno Matos, may be planning for the bank\u2019s use of mortgage brokers, who accounted for two-thirds of its new lending in the latest half. Market observers are watching the issue closely, but many, such as Jarden\u2019s Matt Wilson, believe it will be difficult to reverse the long-term move by customers towards mortgage brokers. \u201cWhilst we applaud the efforts by the CBA and NAB, in particular, to win back the third-party distribution margin in search of better shareholder returns, we think it\u2019s akin to trying to put toothpaste back in the tube,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nIs the CBA \u2018bubble\u2019 deflating? The big question for many investors \u2013 including the people managing our superannuation \u2013 is what all this means for share prices. Loading CBA is the biggest company on the ASX, worth $290 billion after a rally of more than 25 per cent over the past year. The big four combined are worth almost a quarter of the entire ASX 200, and there\u2019s long been a debate about whether Australian bank shares (especially CBA) are overvalued. The violent market reaction to CBA\u2019s largely as-expected result helped reignite this discussion, as analysts questioned if there could be more falls to come for the country\u2019s biggest bank.",

    "text": "After three days of talks, a fairer tax system is on the agenda. There\u2019s no shortage of ideas\n\nDay three of the government\u2019s economic reform roundtable was about budget sustainability. It\u2019s a slow burn issue. If the Australian government spends more than it raises in revenue, it has to finance the difference (the budget deficit) by borrowing. The most recent budget has forecast deficits for at least the next decade.\n\nIt is not an immediate problem. Domestic and overseas investors want to lend to Australia. However, each successive deficit leads to more borrowing \u2013 which keeps the interest bill growing. Eventually this debt has to be repaid.\n\nAt some point governments have to fix the problem through more tax, cutting spending, or both.\n\nThe ideal tax solution is a fairer, simpler system that raises more revenue. There is no shortage of ideas on how.\n\nReform is needed, but how do we get there?\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers emerged from the three-day summit saying there was broad support from the gathered business and union leaders and economists for a simpler and more equitable tax system. He said on Friday morning:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReally, one of the defining outcomes of this economic reform roundtable was building consensus and momentum around ensuring that intergenerational fairness is one of the defining principles of our country, but also of our government.\n\nThe treasurer listed \u201cbuilding a better tax system\u201d as one of ten long-term reform priorities.\n\nHe set three objectives to guide any changes:\n\na fair go for working people\n\nan affordable, responsible way to incentivise business investment\n\nand how to make the system simpler and more sustainable.\n\nThese are laudable goals. The objections will come when government tries to turn them into specific amendments. Australians are notoriously wary of tax changes. There was a taste of this in the backlash to the government\u2019s plan to reduce the tax concessions on superannuation balances over A$3 million.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat is no doubt why Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in advance of the roundtable ruled out further tax changes before the next election.\n\nTax settings should not be \u2018set in stone\u2019\n\nGrattan Institute Chief Executive Aruna Sathanapally presented the roundtable with ideas for a better tax system.\n\nAmong her ideas were making personal income tax more equitable, improving business taxation and introducing a carbon tax.\n\nSathanapally argued rebalancing personal income tax could come in pieces: reducing superannuation concessions, introducing at least a low tax rate on earnings in retirement, reducing the capital gains discount and reforms to family trusts.\n\nOr it could be systematic: a system that brings consistency to how we treat different types of savings.\n\nAnother attendee, economist Bob Breunig, likely gave the roundtable a summary of his and his colleagues\u2019 recent research showing how the tax system unfairly benefits older Australians at the expense of younger Australians paying income tax.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is leading to greater intergenerational inequity. One of the causes is low taxes on income from savings or wealth, housing and superannuation.\n\nGovernment spending is part of the story\n\nThe other side of budget sustainability, spending, garnered less attention despite huge spending pressures.\n\nThe one category of spending that government cannot change by policy is the interest payments on the public debt. All the others are choices. We could decide to spend less in any or all of these areas. Indeed, Health Minister Mark Butler\u2019s announcement of changes to the NDIS goes some way towards that. Other areas could be candidates for savings.\n\nNevertheless, the indicators from the roundtable are that tax reform is a higher priority for the government than spending cuts.\n\nAlthough we may be moving to a consensus that we should do something to fix the tax system, there is little agreement on what that something should be. A long period of discussion and consultation may be just what the government needs.\n\nThe last big tax reform was 25 years ago\n\nWe have been here before. Australia\u2019s last really big tax reform, the GST, was a long time coming. Then-Treasurer Paul Keating proposed it at Labor\u2019s 1985 tax summit, but was overruled.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 1995, Prime Minister John Howard promised the Coalition would \u201cnever, ever\u201d introduce a Goods and Services Tax (GST). However, he changed his position, took it to the 1998 election, and won \u2013 and the GST took effect from July 1, 2000. Controversial then, it is now an accepted part of our tax system.\n\nSomething similar may happen with current tax proposals. The government could hold off implementation until after the next election campaign. If it gains a mandate, following sustained consultation to build support, reforms have a chance of success.\n\nAs an added benefit, a long period of reflection could help the community to connect dots.\n\nHousing affordability, another major challenge addressed by the roundtable, is inextricably linked with tax incentives that put upward pressure on prices. That\u2019s also noted in Breunig\u2019s paper. Through tax reform, we could, if the government gains community support, help solve budget sustainability and housing at the same time. We can only hope.\n\nRead more: Full coverage of the reform roundtable\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
