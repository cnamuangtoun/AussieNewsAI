    "text": "The largest union body in the country has hailed the Fair Work Commission's decision to boost minimum wages for millions of workers.\n\nThe Commission's annual review found that the national minimum wage, as well as modern award minimum wages, should all increase by 3.5 per cent.\n\nThe increase will come into effect from July 1 this year.\ufeff The current national minimum wage is $24.10 per hour, or $915.90 per week. A 3.5 increase will increase that to $24.94 an hour, or just over $30 more a week.\n\nA 3.5 increase will increase that to $24.94 an hour, or just over $30 more a week. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe decision will affect up to about three million Australians, \ufeffaccording to government estimates during the election campaign, though only a small number of those are on the national minimum wage.\n\nA further 20.7 per cent of Australian workers, according to Fair Work Commission president Justice Adam Hatcher\ufeff, are paid the minimum wage applicable under modern workplace awards.\n\n\"The principal consideration which has guided our decision is the fact that, since July 2021, employees who are reliant on modern award minimum wages or the national minimum wage have suffered a reduction in the real value of their wage rates,\" Hatcher said.\n\n\"In the case of modern awards, the benchmark C10 award rate of pay has declined by 4.5 percentage points relative to inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Huge eruption in Italy leaves tourists fleeing volcano\n\nThe decision will affect up to about three million people. (Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\nHatcher said that this had been due to the major spike in inflation which had begun in 2021.\n\n\"The result has been that living standards for employees dependent on modern award wages have been squeezed and the low paid have experienced greater difficulty in meeting their everyday needs,\" he said.\n\nHowever, with the Reserve Bank of Australia deeming inflation to be \"sustainably\" within the target rate of between 2 and 3 per cent, Hatcher said, it was appropriate to boost minimum wage payments above inflation.\n\nThe five qualifications in hot demand for Australia's future jobs View Gallery\n\n\"We are concerned that if this opportunity is not taken in this Annual Wage Review, the loss in the real value of wages which has occurred will become permanently embedded in the modern award system and the national minimum wage, and a reduction in living standards for the lowest paid in the community will thereby be entrenched,\" he said.\ufeff\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics reported in March th\ufeffat inflation was at 2.4 per cent, unchanged from the previous quarter.\n\n\ufeffAustralian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus praised the decision, despite the ACTU backing a larger 4.5 per cent increase.\n\n\"This decision delivers a 1.1 per cent real wage increase, one of the largest real wage increases the Fair Work Commission has awarded,\" McManus said.\n\n\"This wage increase means those who are paid award wages will start to get ahead again, easing pressure on their weekly budgets and part of the stress that comes from having to cut back on the basics.\"\n\nLast year, the commission increased the minimum wage by 3.75 per cent.\ufeff",

    "text": "Want to reach older age with a sharp mind and healthy body?\n\nPart of the answer may be in your coffee cup, according to new research.\n\n\"Women who drank one to three cups of caffeinated coffee per day in their 50s were more likely to reach older age free from major chronic diseases and with good cognitive, physical, and mental health,\" said lead study author Dr Sara Mahdavi, adjunct professor in the faculty of medicine and department of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto.\n\nResearchers analysed dietary data from more than 47,000 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, according to the research released at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando.\n\nPart of the answer may be in your coffee cup, according to new research. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe study was presented as an abstract, but a more in-depth manuscript of the investigation will be submitted for peer review in the coming months, Mahdavi said.\n\nThe women were surveyed in middle age and followed for 30 years to understand their rates of death and disease.\n\n\"In this study, we found that moderate caffeinated coffee consumption during midlife was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging 30 years later,\" Mahdavi said.\n\nDrinking one to three cups of coffee daily was associated with lower disease and better cognition is older age, a study showed. (Jacob Wackerhausen/iStockphoto/Getty/CNN)\n\nIt's not just any caffeinated drink\n\nThe effects were found in caffeinated coffee in particular, according to the research. The same link was not found for tea or decaffeinated coffee \u2013 and drinking more cola or other caffeinated sodas was tied to a lower chance of healthy aging.\n\n\"This would imply that coffee in particular has health preserving or promoting effects,\" said Dr David Kao, Jacqueline Marie Schauble Leaffer Endowed Chair in Women's Heart Disease and associate professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical School in an email.\n\n\"As with other studies , they also appear to have found that coffee has a particular benefit over other caffeinated drinks.\"\n\nOther caffeinated beverages like cola didn't demonstrate the same benefits. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThat said, the research is high quality, added Kao, who was not involved in the research.\n\nThe study is also observational, meaning it is limited in its ability to examine direct cause and effect. The new research can only show that a behaviour and an outcome are more likely to occur together.\n\nResearchers did take that into account and adjusted for other factors that could link coffee drinking and healthy aging such as lifestyle, demographic and other dietary differences, but it is still possible there is another variable at play, Mahdavi said.\n\nBut the link between coffee and healthy aging isn't surprising \u2013 it is consistent with prior research, Kao said.\n\nModerate coffee drinking has been linked before to lower risks of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, he added.\n\nIs it time to start drinking coffee?\n\nDoes this mean you should take on a coffee habit if you don't have one already? Not necessarily, Mahdavi said.\n\n\"Coffee may support longevity, but it's not a universal prescription \u2013 especially for women. Hormonal shifts influence how caffeine is metabolised, so the benefits depend on timing, biology, and individual health,\" she said in an email.\n\nEstrogen inhibits a liver enzyme that is crucial for breaking down caffeine, which means that caffeine may last longer in the body of some people, especially those going through hormonal transitions such as menopause or pregnancy or those using oral contraception, Mahdavi said.\n\nThe study particularly emphasised potential benefits for women. (Getty)\n\nMidlife, the time period examined in this study, is a life stage marked by hormonal and metabolic shifts for women, she added.\n\n\"Moderate caffeinated coffee consumption \u2013 typically one to three cups per day \u2013 can be part of a healthy diet for many adults,\" Mahdavi said. \"However, this should not be taken as a blanket recommendation for everyone to begin or increase coffee intake with the goal of longevity.\"\n\nFor one thing, the data can't say whether increasing coffee consumption would help to preserve health, Kao said.\n\n\"In other words, although women who drink three cups of coffee/day might have better long-term functioning than non-coffee drinkers, we don't know if non-coffee drinkers started drinking three cups a day, whether they would have better functioning than if they remained non-coffee drinkers,\" he said in an email.\n\nMan armed with plastic bags defies world's biggest army View Gallery\n\nWho needs to watch their coffee intake?\n\nThe findings do suggest that people don't necessarily need to decrease their coffee consumption in the name of healthy aging, Kao said.\n\n\"Coffee is an important and positive part of daily life in many cultures around the world, he said. \"For many \u2026 the knowledge that a daily coffee or three is probably not harmful is welcome news.\"\n\nThat said, some people do need to watch their coffee consumption, including those with high blood pressure, heart disease, anxiety and sleep disorders, said Dr Lu Qi, HCA Regents Distinguished Chair and professor at Tulane University Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans.\n\nQi was not involved in the research but was involved in another recent study showing that having coffee in the morning had a better impact on lowering death rates than drinking it throughout the day.\n\nAlthough coffee may be an enjoyable aspect of good health, it does not replace other healthy behaviors such as eating nutritious foods, exercising and getting good sleep, Mahdavi added.",

(ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Eliza Bidstrup)\n\nShire of Northam president Chris Antonio said the town's ability to embrace the cool conditions of the Avon Valley that were ideal for hot air ballooning, and turn them into a thriving tourist economy, was vital to the growth of the region.\n\n\"Leveraging our unique climate and tying it in with ballooning is more important than I probably even realised,\" he said.\n\n\"Traditionally in WA, tourism booms through the sunny months of the year, but we've been able to make tourism work in the peak of winter \u2014 that's our busiest time of year.\n\n\"We are able to position ourselves as the ballooning capital of Australia.\"\n\nChris Antonio says the community is redefining tourism in the region. (ABC Midwest Wheatbelt: Eliza Bidstrup)\n\nMr Antonio said the town, which traditionally operated as a service town for smaller Wheatbelt communities, had previously struggled to establish a strong brand with tourists, but through hot air ballooning had become competitive with other tourism regions of the state.\n\n\"We're not going to compete with the Margaret Rivers of the world \u2014 we don't have beaches and we are OK with that,\" he said.\n\n\"But when winter comes, we have the flowing Avon River and the hot air balloons.\n\n\"You can't do that in other places.

    "text": "Millions of Australian workers will get a 3.5 per cent pay rise from July 1, following the Fair Work Commission's (FWC) annual review of the minimum wage and award agreements.\n\nThe commission's decision increases the national minimum wage to $24.95 per hour or $948 per week, based on a full-time, 38-hour working week.\n\nInflation is currently at 2.4 per cent annually.\n\nWhile the national minimum wage covers a small proportion of the workforce, about a fifth of all employees in Australia are paid at a minimum award rate.\n\nWorkers reliant on award wages are disproportionately female and more than half are employed casually, while two-thirds work part-time hours and more than a third are low paid.\n\nThis means the wages paid to award workers only make up 10.5 per cent of the national \"wage bill\", the FWC noted.\n\nAward workers are concentrated in the accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, retail trade, and administrative and support services sectors.\n\n\"The principal decision which has guided our decision is the fact that, since July 2021, the real value of modern award wages \u2026 has declined by 4.5 percentage points relative to inflation,\" the review read.\n\nThe FWC said at its last three annual decisions, it put off taking action to reverse the decline in real wages \"out of a concern that this might result in the further persistence of higher inflation\".\n\n\" The result has been that living standards for employees dependent on modern award wages have been squeezed and the low paid have experienced greater difficulty in meeting their everyday needs. \"\n\nIt said with inflation now back within the Reserve Bank's 2-3 per cent target range, it has now taken the opportunity to go some of the way to correcting the decline in real wages.\n\n\"We are concerned that if this opportunity is not taken in this Review, the loss in the real value of wages which has occurred will become permanently embedded in the modern award system, and the [national minimum wage] and a reduction in living standards for the lowest paid in the community will thereby be entrenched,\" the decision stated.\n\n3.5pc increase lands in between business and union calls\n\nThe FWC ruling was announced today after lobbying from various groups.\n\nThe federal government had argued for an \"economically sustainable real wage increase\" \u2014 while not putting a firm figure on its request, it indicated support for a wage rise above inflation.\n\nBusiness groups including the Australian Retailers Association and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry had called for no more than 2.5 per cent, arguing any more would put too much pressure on employers.\n\nAustralian Industry Group was slightly higher at 2.6 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) had lobbied for a rise of up to 4.5 per cent.\n\nACTU secretary Sally McManus welcomed the FWC decision, describing it as a \"great outcome\".\n\n\"It's 1.1 per cent more than inflation, so it means that, finally, award wage workers in Australia \u2014 our lowest-paid workers \u2014 are getting ahead again,\" she told a press conference.\n\n\"The Fair Work Commission accepted the arguments made by unions that it was time for low-wage workers, award workers, to start catching up for what was lost during the inflation spike.\"\n\nThe FWC boosted the minimum wage and awards by 3.75 per cent last year, after higher inflation pushed real wage growth further down in comparison.",

(Supplied: Jessie Stott)\n\nThe Nirimba resident, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, trained at a gym five days a week, ate a balanced diet and had no family history of cancer.\n\nShe enjoyed her job and was studying nursing.\n\nShe and her high-school sweetheart partner, 37-year-old carpenter Lucas Vogelpoel, were even trying for a baby.\n\nBut her persistent cough would not go away.\n\n\"Doctors kept saying it was a viral infection, but then it kept getting worse,\" Ms Stott said.\n\nDeadly diagnosis\n\nAfter months of pushing for answers, her doctor ordered a CT scan in March.\n\nIt revealed an 80-millimetre growth on her chest \u2014 the size of an orange.\n\nShe was referred to a surgeon in April but the waiting time was more than two months.\n\nWith the growth pressing on her heart, no diagnosis and still no real answers, Ms Stott's symptoms worsened.\n\nThen in early May, late on a Friday night, she woke up unable to breathe and with a \"tingly\" left arm.\n\n\"I thought I was having a heart attack,\" Ms Stott said.\n\nShe was rushed to Sunshine Coast University Hospital.\n\nJessie Stott has been in hospital since early May.

    "text": "In 1971, John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono swapped their Ascot mansion and 70-acre estate for a two-room loft in New York's Greenwich Village.\n\nThey threw themselves headfirst into the political and social movements of the time, helping the counterculture pick up the pieces after what Lennon perceived as the failure of the 'Flower Power' movement in the years prior.\n\nIt was a significant move for arguably the most famous singer of all time. Lennon turned his back on what could have been an enviable life as part of high society and instead invested his energy and money in ensuring the youth of America didn't become apathetic in the quest for non-violence and equality.\n\n\"I'm happy as Larry,\" Lennon said at the time. \"I feel like a student again. We're like a young married couple.\"\n\nThe only full concert John Lennon played after the break-up of The Beatles is a key part of this new documentary about his life with Yoko Ono in the early 1970s. (Supplied: Sydney Film Festival)\n\nOne To One: John and Yoko is a fascinating, fast-paced collage of old footage and taped phone conversations that take us inside the couples' movements at this time.\n\nThe phone calls are particularly compelling as we hear the couple scheming, cycling through a variety of causes, seemingly aching for places they can lend their celebrity clout to raise awareness.\n\nThere are a few recurring narratives throughout that keep us engrossed. One of them involves capturing thousands of live flies for a Yoko Ono art exhibit, another sees them convince infamous Bob Dylan stalker A. J. Weberman to back off his target, while there are chilling moments where Lennon \u2014 who was shot dead in 1980 \u2014 ruminates about becoming a target when appearing at key demonstrations.\n\nAnother through line revolves around the only full-length concert John Lennon gave after The Beatles's split and before his death.\n\nThe concert, which happened across two sessions at Madison Square Garden in 1972, was a benefit for the children of the Willowbrook School \u2014 an institution caring for children with intellectual disabilities. Footage from the show is great, but even more interesting is learning how the couple arrived at the idea to play the show.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nBecause there are so many individual examples of John and Yoko's activism, it makes for a fast-paced video diary with a frenetic energy that perhaps speaks to the couple's own chaotic momentum.\n\n\"I thought: There's enough here that we could just let them speak for themselves, allow the audience to eavesdrop on them and allow that to be part of the fun of the film,\" director Kevin Macdonald said in publicity materials around the film.\n\n\"I think that's much more interesting than a traditional biopic, where the filmmakers are trying to present a very coherent version of things. As we all know, life is chaotic and contradictory.\"\n\nEven if your interest in John and Yoko themselves is negligible, the film will still offer a captivating snapshot of the social and political climate of the time.\n\nWhether it's Carole Feraci's protest against Richard Nixon, the railing against inhumane conditions at Attica State prison, or the case of poet John Sinclair, who was jailed for 10 years for cannabis possession, the film covers plenty of historical moments that paint a riveting picture of the counterculture of the time. And people with a love for old New York City will revel in the way the film plops us right in that space and time.\n\nThe treatment of Yoko Ono by Lennon's adoring fans and even his Beatles band mates is laid bare in some confronting conversations, where the artist bluntly recounts the comments and violence she'd been subjected to.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nSpeaking of violence, Lennon's past behaviours are only vaguely hinted at. The takeaway message is that the John Lennon of the early 70s was a more enlightened man than the one who grew up scrapping in Liverpool and was violent towards his first wife, Cynthia, in the 1960s.\n\n\"I fell in love with an independent, eloquent, outspoken, creative genius,\" Lennon says at one point. \"I started waking up.\"\n\nWhile there may be a touch of hagiography about One To One, it's a rare example of a John Lennon documentary that offers something many fans might not have seen or even known about before. As far as history lessons go, it's totally compelling.\n\nAs we learned in the eight-hour 2021 documentary Get Back, which took us inside the recording of The Beatles's final album, being a fly on the wall for historical moments is a captivating prospect. This film moves far quicker, but the same idea applies: we're always shown what John and Yoko do rather than merely told about it.\n\n\"Very early on, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to try and chase old men on their deathbeds to get their last John Lennon anecdote \u2014 which they've probably told before,\" director Macdonald said.\n\nOne To One: John & Yoko is a truly intimate capture of what drove this couple at a key point in their life, and how their very presence at this key moment had an impact on the countercultural movement of the time.\n\nOne To One: John & Yoko screens at the Sydney Film Festival this weekend.",

(ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nThe Yogi mine has a groundwater licence to extract 4.5 gigalitres a year from the region.\n\nA gigalitre is 1 billion litres of water.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Authority has instructed that there must be \"no impact to quantity or quality of the Yalgoo Water Reserve\" and \"no adverse impacts to nearby groundwater users identified at risk within the drawdown area, including pastoral stations for stock use\".\n\nYalgoo shire's concerns\n\nShire of Yalgoo chief executive Ian Holland said he was worried.\n\nYalgoo Water Reserve is a priority public drinking water source. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\n\"The paleochannels are not terribly well known. We won't see the effects of the drawdown and de-watering of the mine until it has physically happened,\" Mr Holland said.\n\n\"There's, unfortunately, no way of knowing until the water starts getting pumped out.\n\n\"It will definitely affect stock water. Chances are more bores will be needed in different areas.\"\n\nAfter identifying that bores used to water livestock could be impacted by FIJV plans, the company said it would find an alternative water supply for any affected pastoralists.\n\nIan Holland says water sources will be impacted by the development. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nThe shire has lodged an objection in WA's mining Wardens Court against FIJV's plans for the Yalgoo area, which Mr Holland said could result in mining the hill containing tourist attraction Jokers Tunnel, risking its destruction.\n\nMr Holland said the shire had unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate compensation from the company if the tunnel were destroyed.\n\n\"We would like to see it protected into the future; it is a fantastic cultural and local tourist spot that has existed for the past 100 years,\" he said.\n\n\" The shire is looking at options for shoring up land tenure in the future. \"\n\nThe Yalgoo landscape has a history of mining and pastoral activity. (ABC Mid West and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nMr Holland said he hoped the prospect of the mine's 1,000 workers \"just up the road\" in a camp would benefit the small town of 300 people, which had a pub, a shop and a nursing post.\n\nHe said the shire was hoping for co-location of essential services, such as healthcare.\n\nHe also hoped some people working at the mine would choose to live in Yalgoo, rather than flying or driving in and out of the mining camp.\n\nBut he said the miner would build its own airstrip rather than using Yalgoo's.\n\nYalgoo is a sleepy outback town famous for its wildflowers and historic sites. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nInfrastructure for exporting\n\nTrucks carrying iron ore from inland mines to the closest port in Geraldton pass through Yalgoo every few minutes.\n\nAlong with its Yogi magnetite iron ore mine, FIJV wants to construct a 250-kilometre slurry pipeline from the mine to the Geraldton port as a way to transport the mineral.\n\nIt also plans a return water pipeline and a gas supply pipeline from Dampier in the north to the Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline in the south.\n\nMr Holland welcomed a proposal that would not put more trucks on the road.\n\nBut he said the prospect of an above-ground pipeline through the shire presented concerns for livestock and native animal movement, and bushfire control.\n\n\"It would be nice to see co-investment for things like rail,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, FIJV director Leon Taylor said the company was confident and excited about its mining development in the Yalgoo area, saying it would benefit the community and the region.\n\nMr Taylor said the shire's concerns about groundwater impact were misplaced.\n\n\"The water licence was granted subject to anticipated and strict conditions, including monitoring, and the company will comply with all conditions,\" a statement read.\n\nMr Taylor said the mining warden had asked the shire to produce statements in support of its objections by July 4, 2025.\n\nHe said the company would consider any written statements that it received from the shire, but could not comment further while the process was still in the Wardens Court.\n\nEarlier this year, FIJV announced an agreement with Green Iron and Steel Australia to develop a magnetite processing hub, producing shippable hot briquetted iron as part of a supply chain for low-emission steel production.",

It followed an earlier incident between the two drivers when Russell tried to get past Verstappen, who went off the track.\n\nThe race stewards ruled Verstappen \"suddenly accelerated\" before the collision and Russell said it \"felt very deliberate\".\n\nThe stewards gave Verstappen a 10-second penalty, which dropped him from fifth to 10th and left him 49 points off standings leader Oscar Piastri, who won Sunday's race.\n\n\"We had an exciting strategy and good race in Barcelona, 'till the safety car came out. Our tire choice to the end and some moves after the safety car restart fuelled my frustration, leading to a move that was not right and shouldn't have happened,\" Verstappen wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"I always give everything out there for the team and emotions can run high. You win some together, you lose some together. See you (at the next race) in Montreal.\"\n\nInitially in the aftermath of the race, Verstappen had said that \"next time I will bring a tissue\", responding to Russell claiming he set a poor example for young drivers. Russell finished fourth.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe collision followed a series of setbacks for Verstappen, who had been in third and pressuring the two McLaren drivers in front before the safety car came out.\n\nRed Bull decided to bring Verstappen into the pits for fresh tires, even though the only ones he had left were slower hard-compound tires, a type that no other driver used.\n\nAt the restart, Verstappen lost grip and was overtaken by Charles Leclerc, whose Ferrari made contact with Verstappen's Red Bull. Neither driver was ruled at fault for that.\n\nVerstappen then went off the track while defending against Russell and Red Bull asked Verstappen to give up the place to Russell, apparently because the team expected Verstappen would be given a penalty. The stewards later ruled they would not have taken action against the Dutch driver for that incident.\n\nVerstappen needs to be careful in the next two races because the penalty for the collision with Russell also brought him penalty points on his licence, taking him to 11 in the past 12 months. Drivers get a one-race suspension if they hit 12 points in a year.\n\nTwo of those points expire at the end of the month but, until then, Verstappen needs to get through the Canadian and Austrian races without any further penalty points.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "A proud Daria Kasatkina says the embrace she has felt from Australia during her first grand slam under its flag was like nothing she had ever known in her tennis career.\n\nKasatkina finally bowed out at the French Open on Monday, beaten by the 18-year-old phenom and her fellow Russian-born friend Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 7-5 after what the victorious teenager rightly called a \"hell of a match\" in the fourth round at Roland-Garros.\n\nTwo months after being granted permanent residency, Kasatkina's hopes of becoming the first Australian woman to reach the quarterfinals since Ash Barty's triumphant year of 2019 fell short, but the 28-year-old said she enjoyed being the \"last Aussie standing\".\n\n\"It's been a good start,\" she said.\n\n\"First of all it's been a good result but also, I felt super good to step on the court as an Australian player.\n\n\"To feel the support from the stands so many times. I don't know if everyone who was screaming, 'Aussie', were from Australia, but I felt this support. Also, on social media I'm getting a lot of support from the Australians that they are so happy to welcome me, and they're happy for me.\n\n\"So this is the kind of support which I honestly didn't have before, it feels like it's something new to me \u2014 but it feels so nice.\"\n\nWhen asked if everyone was now allowed to call her \"an Aussie battler\" after she had given the sixth seed a real scare with her second-set counterattack when she even earned a set point, Kasatkina offered a wry smile and replied: \"If you want to \u2026\"\n\nIt was a tremendous match full of variety, like blitz chess between two all-court grandmasters, played in a fabulous spirit by two training partners.\n\nTheir 94-minute duel on Court Suzanne Lenglen ended with Kasatkina chucking her wristband jokingly at her conqueror at the net, while Andreeva informed the crowd tongue-in-cheek that she only practised with the Aussie because she hated her.\n\n\"Maybe we know each other too good, maybe we have to take a break in practising \u2026 no, I'm kidding,\" Kasatkina said.\n\nThe only other time they had played a match was in the final of last October's Ningbo Open in China, with Andreeva ending in tears and needing to be comforted by the player 10 years her senior after blowing a 3-0 lead in the final set.\n\nThings have clearly changed. Andreeva has grown up. This time, she said it was easy to put friendship aside as she repelled Kasatkina's second-set surge when the world No.17 went from 3-1 down to 5-3 up, with a combination of the most extraordinary defensive resolve and some ferocious attacking shots.\n\nAll looked lost for Kasatkina at the start of the second, but she lived up to her promise that she was ready to \"die on court\" as she chased down seemingly impossible causes and even outlasted the youngster to win one remarkable 26-shot rally.\n\nAnd that utter determination did give Andreeva problems as Kasatkina earned a set point on the youngster's delivery at 5-4, only to be deprived by a powerful forehand.\n\nOnce back level, Andreeva began to dictate. One piece of amazing retrieving also induced a dismal Kasatkina smash into the net, and enabled her to break to love, before she sealed the deal on her second match point when the Aussie hit a forehand long.\n\nAndreeva has reached the quarters without dropping a set and is the youngest woman this century to achieve back-to-back last-eight appearances. Martina Hingis last did it in 1998.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAsked if her input in practice might have helped Andreeva mature, Kasatkina said: \"I hope not!\"\n\nBut she did recognise a completely different force to the player she played in Ningbo.\n\n\"Well, she grew so much. I feel like she's taller and taller every single week, her serve's improving all the time and her movement is very good,\" she said.\n\nAustralian interest remains strong around the grounds, with world No.2 junior Emerson Jones through to the second round of the girls' event with a 6-1, 1-6, 6-2 win over American Capucine Jauffret.\n\nOlympic men's doubles champions John Peers and Matt Ebden beat Italian fourth seeds Andrea Vavassori and Simone Bolelli 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) to make the quarter-finals.\n\nSinner dominates Rublev to reach quarters\n\nTop-ranked men's player Jannik Sinner's latest dominant performance at the French Open was a 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 victory over No.17 Andrey Rublev to reach the quarterfinals and extend his Grand Slam winning streak to 18 matches.\n\nSinner is a three-time major champion who won the US Open last September and the Australian Open this January. Now he'll try to get to the semifinals at Roland-Garros for the second consecutive year and faces 62nd-ranked Alexander Bublik on Wednesday.\n\nSinner hasn't lost a set and has dropped a total of 30 games in Paris so far.\n\nSinner began somewhat slowly against Rublev under the lights at Court Philippe-Chatrier. Well, for four points, anyway. Rublev got two break points at 15-40 in the opening game, but Sinner erased those and was on his way.\n\nHe only faced one other break point the rest of the match and saved it, too.\n\nSinner finished the first set with 10 winners to just three unforced errors and kept the pressure on Rublev.\n\nEmotional Bublik creates history for Kazakhstan\n\nAlexander Bublik became the first man from Kazakhstan to reach the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam tournament, eliminating No.5 Jack Draper 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.\n\nThe 27-year-old Bublik dropped to the court, smudging himself with the red clay, when he finished off the biggest win of his career.\n\n\"Sometimes in life, there is only one chance, and I had a feeling that that was mine and I couldn't let it slip,\" he told the crowd afterward.\n\n\"Standing here is the best moment of my life. Period.\"\n\nMoments later, he joked: \"I'm standing here like I won the thing.\"\n\nBublik managed to produce a total of 68 winners, 31 more than the left-handed Draper.\n\nAt No.62, Bublik is the lowest-ranked man to earn a pair of victories at Roland-Garros against opponents ranked in the top 10 since No.100 Andrei Medvedev in 1999. Bublik came back from a two-set deficit to defeat No.9 Alex de Minaur in the second round last week.\n\n\"I have a certain skill set to play tennis,\" Bublik said.\n\n\"And it worked marvelously today \u2014 100 per cent one of the best days of my life and one of the best matches I have ever played in my life.\"\n\nDjokovic notches win number 100 at the Roland-Garros\n\nNovak Djokovic earned his 100th career French Open victory, a mark surpassed among men only by Rafael Nadal, by overwhelming Cam Norrie 6-2, 6-3, 6-2.\n\nDjokovic hasn't ceded a set on his way to the quarterfinals this year at Roland-Garros, where he has won three of his 24 Grand Slam titles.\n\n\"I feel good. Every day, I have more expectations about my game, (and with) 12 sets played, 12 sets won, everything is solid and positive,\" Djokovic said.\n\nThe 38-year-old Serbian had a pair of three-match losing streaks this season but seems to be in top form lately, including collecting his 100th title at the Geneva Open the week before play began in Paris. He also beat Norrie in Geneva.\n\n\"He was solid today, and he didn't give me anything,\" Norrie said.\n\n\"Defending well, serving well, returning well and very sharp.\"\n\nNext up for Djokovic is a matchup against No.3 seed Alexander Zverev.\n\n\"He definitely knows how to play tennis. He definitely knows what it means to be on the big stage and to play big matches,\" Zverev said about Djokovic.\n\n\"There is no doubt about that.\"\n\nDjokovic improved to 100-16 at the French Open. Nadal, who retired at the end of last season, went 112-4 while winning a record 14 championships at the clay-court major.\n\nGauff wins but still cops jokes about forgetting her racquets\n\nCoco Gauff earned her fifth consecutive trip to the French Open quarterfinals with a straight-sets victory, but she still is catching flak because she forgot to bring her racquets to a match earlier in the tournament.\n\nThe No.2-seeded Gauff, who won the 2023 US Open and was the runner-up in Paris in 2022, has been engaging in a bit of back-and-forth with another American and Roland-Garros quarterfinalist, Frances Tiafoe, over the equipment blunder.\n\nTiafoe teasingly called the 21-year-old Gauff \"Mrs Mature.\"\n\nGauff's retort: \"I feel like maybe just playing tennis, it forces you to grow up faster for some people. Maybe not him.\"\n\nIt was Tiafoe who first made that very mistake back in March, showing up for a match at the tournament in Indian Wells, California, without his racquets. He got plenty of ribbing on social media and from other players \u2014 including Gauff.\n\nSo when Gauff went to Court Philippe-Chatrier for her first-round match last week and opened her bag only to realise there weren't any rackets inside, the 27-year-old Tiafoe was only too happy to call her out.\n\n\"She was full out shaking her whole bag like it was an empty cookie jar on Chatrier. I was like, 'What are you doing?' \u2026 I'm going to keep ripping her for a long time. I've never seen someone (ranked No.2) in the world have zero things in her bag. That was incredible,\" Tiafoe said.\n\n\"That kind of thing is so big because it just makes everyone (realise) we're all human. People make mistakes, whether it's the team or her or whatever.\n\n\"That was a funny moment, especially (because) she tries to be Mrs Mature. That was great. I'm happy it happened to her. Hopefully it happens again.\"\n\nWild card wins through to the quarterfinals\n\nLo\u00efs Boisson never had played at the French Open, let alone in the biggest arena at Roland-Garros. Nothing fazed the French wild card entry and now she is in the quarterfinals.\n\nBoisson, ranked 361st, threw her head back and roared after beating No.3 seed Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nShe is by far the lowest-ranked woman to beat someone ranked in the top five at the French Open in 40 years. The lowest previously in that span was No.179 Aniko Kapros, who eliminated No.5 Justine Henin in the first round in 2002.\n\nBoisson also is the lowest-ranked woman to reach the quarterfinals at Roland-Garros since at least 1985.\n\nQuite a victory, considering Pegula was the US Open runner-up last year. Understandably, Boisson was nervous as she served for the match and saved three break points.\n\nAfter Pegula missed an easy-looking winner at the net and clutched her head in her hands, Boisson had her first match point, the biggest point of her career.\n\nPegula returned a strong serve to the back of the court, where Boisson unleashed a forehand winner down the line. She then raised her arms and realised the enormity of her win.\n\n\"Thank you to all of you,\" Boisson told the crowd in her post-match interview.\n\n\"Playing on this court with such an atmosphere was really incredible.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nThat's right, it's arguably more dangerous to put fighters in a ring with gloves on than without, because they can punch harder and for longer without breaking their hands.\n\nMore long-term independent research is probably required to substantiate the claims either way, but it's worth considering if boxing gloves are for safety, or the theatre of safety.\n\nAnd just as gloves serve to protect a fighter's hands rather than the head of whoever's being punched, politics sometimes serves politicians rather than the people they represent.\n\nAthletes or barbarians\n\nIt would be inaccurate to say the AMA only believes getting punched by bare knuckles is dangerous \u2014 the group thinks getting hit in the head at all is dangerous, which is why it lobbied for mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions (fought with gloves) to be outlawed too.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook has so far refused to step in and stop the event. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nLabor government ministers have repeatedly voiced their disdain for bare-knuckle boxing \u2014 including the premier, sports minister, and health minister \u2014 but they've refused to call off the competition proposed for next month.\n\nMeanwhile, the WA Liberals have pounced on the government for its inaction, and for allowing a sport that it says would set a \"shocking example\" for young men and the wider community.\n\nBasil Zempilas has called on the premier to step in over the bare-knuckle boxing event. (AAP: Richard Wainwright)\n\nShouting matches have ensued in parliament.\n\nBut let's be clear \u2014 both sides say organised fighting is OK. Just keep the gloves on.\n\nWoodside approval paves the way for the mother of all climate battles Photo shows Woodside future - North Rankin When all the hype and the fury are stripped away, the decision to extend the life of the gigantic North West Shelf LNG plant boils down to one thing \u2014 enabling the Browse gas project off the Kimberley coast.\n\nFor years the WA Labor government has supported MMA cage fight nights which inject millions of dollars into the economy, and the WA Liberal leader says the thin piece of padding on an MMA fighter's knuckles differentiates sport from \"barbaric\" violence.\n\nWhether bare-knuckle fighting should be allowed, or not, is a worthwhile discussion.\n\nThe question is whether debates should be guided by evidence, or by arbitrary lines drawn for political point scoring.\n\nAnd that goes for issues of national importance too \u2014 such as last week's controversial decision to extend the life of Australia's largest oil and gas project, Woodside Energy's North West Shelf.\n\nTheatre of politics\n\nYet that critically important decision was not devoid of theatre either.\n\nThe extension paves the way for Woodside's proposal to develop the Browse basin which contains gas reserves large enough to fuel all of Australia's domestic needs for almost 20 years, and environmentalists say it would make it Australia's largest carbon polluter.\n\nThe federal government has approved a plan to extend the life of the North West Shelf gas project in northern Western Australia. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)\n\nIt's been a long road to get to this point. Countless discussions about balancing industry, economy, environment, and culture.\n\nAnd here comes the theatre.\n\nPart of those discussions is an ongoing study of the impact of industrial air emissions on ancient rock carvings in WA's north, near Woodside's Karratha gas plant.\n\nA progress report handed to the state government in June last year was only released a week ago on a late Friday afternoon, just days before the federal government gave the North West Shelf its tick of approval.\n\nThere are fears ancient petroglyphs could be degraded by increased emissions in the area. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nThe report came with a summary document stating \"the current levels of the pollutants of most concern for the rock art are lower than the interim guideline levels\".\n\nBut the summary omitted a graph line \u2014 still available in the full 800-page report \u2014 which showed five monitoring sites closest to industry were experiencing pollution above the interim guideline.\n\nPremier Cook's response: \"The science has said that modern industrial developments do not have a long-term impact.\"\n\nWoodside has been given approval to run the Karratha Gas Plant until 2070. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)\n\nOne scientist involved in the study, who spoke to 7.30 on the condition of anonymity, said the premier's claim was \"simply false\".\n\nTraditional owners to keep fighting North West Shelf extension Photo shows A rock carving of an lizard on red rocks Traditional owners have pledged to continue fighting the decision to extend the North West Shelf gas plant, as environmentalists shift their focus to Woodside's next major project.\n\n\"We're talking about what is probably the cumulative effect of decades of pollution,\" the scientist said.\n\n\"There is this terminological or verbal gymnastic about whether it all happened in the past and is no longer happening ... but there's no reason to conclude that it has stopped.\"\n\nTheatre.\n\nPolitics is sometimes a spectacle, as bare-knuckle boxing is.\n\nThe difference is boxers volunteer to punch and get punched, while the public bears the consequences of politicians brandishing their knuckles in parliament.",

(ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)\n\n'Unprecedented' strain\n\nThe dairy heartlands of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania are in the grips of drought, while many farms in New South Wales and Queensland are recovering from floods.\n\n\"This is not a normal year,\" Colac dairy farmer and Dairy Farmers Victoria president Mark Billing said.\n\n\"The climate challenges we are seeing right across Victoria, coupled with extraordinary cost increases on farm, mean that farmers are carrying unprecedented levels of financial and emotional strain.\"\n\nHe said companies risked the rapid decline of Australia's milk production if they did not increase prices to help dairy farmers through the tough times.\n\n\"Milk processors have repeatedly said they value their suppliers,\" Mr Billing said.\n\n\" This is the year where those words need to be backed by action. \"\n\nMark Billing says farmers are carrying unprecedented levels of strain. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)\n\nHow much are they getting?\n\nThe majority of farmers are paid for the level of fat and protein in their milk, known as milk solids.\n\nMany were hoping to be paid at least $9.20 to $9.50 per kilogram of milk solids, which equated to about 70 cents per litre.\n\nMr Billing said the prices under $9.20 on offer from the dairy companies were not enough for farmers to get by.\n\nUnited Dairyfarmers of Victoria president Bernie Free agreed.\n\n\"It's pretty disappointing, really,\" he said.\n\nHe said some farmers would quit the industry if milk prices did not go up soon.\n\n\"I think it's a concern that farmers may move out of the industry at this price mark, especially in [drought-affected] western Victoria,\" he said.\n\n\"Gippsland is not far behind us, and there are pockets in north-east Victoria that are doing it pretty tough.\n\n\" There is only so long you can throw good money after bad. \"\n\nDairy farmers are disappointed by the price they will be paid for their milk. (ABC News: Warwick Long)\n\nMilk production drops\n\nDairy Australia's latest outlook shows the national milk pool is on track to drop 1 per cent this financial year, compared to the previous one.\n\nIt has also forecast a further drop in production of up to 2 per cent in 2025/26.\n\nIf that happened, milk production would sit around 8.24 billion litres, almost 3 billion less than the industry's peak in the early 2000s.\n\nDairy Australia analysis and insights manager, Eliza Redfern, said ongoing challenges with the weather were affecting production.\n\n\"We are also seeing a lower appetite for farm business growth, and we do expect some farm exits to continue within the new season,\" she said.\n\nDairy Australia is forecasting a drop in national milk production next financial year. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nHigher price than last year\n\nFonterra Oceania was the first milk company to announce its opening milk price for the next season, with one of the lowest prices \u2014 an average of $8.60 per kilo of milk solids.\n\nIts director of farm source and sustainability, Matt Watt, said while it was higher than last year's opening price, he understood farmers would like more.\n\n\"What we've got to do is make sure we're running a business that is here, not only this year, but for years to come,\" he said.\n\n\"That's our job, frankly, to make sure that we're continuing to make decisions that support paying a milk price that we're earning in the market.\n\n\"Sometimes that is a milk price that farmers appreciate and enjoy, and other times it takes a bit of time.\"",

The peacock, with its picturesque plumage, is frequently used as the subject for shell art, whether from the 19th century or the 1950s, when shell art gained momentum.\n\nThe medium also came to the fore in the 1970s when everything was embellished with shells, from photo frames and mirrors to trinket boxes and even furniture. And if you think these pieces should just be relegated to the \u201970s beach shack then take another look, as shell art finds its own place in history decades later.\n\nA recently completed beach house featuring an extensive collection of shell art.

    "text": "America\u2019s government finances are about to get a lot worse. The \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d currently before the US Senate, with its extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, would add more than $US3.3 trillion to that debt within a decade and (because the spending measures are front-loaded, with expenditure cuts deferred) about 1.8 percentage points to the US debt-to-GDP ratio in its first year. Trump and his administration risk isolating America as they look to bully the rest of the world. Credit: Bloomberg Concern about the increase in debt the bill would generate, along with the chaos created by Trump\u2019s tariffs, have already caused US bond yields to rise significantly and produced some weakness in demand in auctions of bonds with longer durations. Bond investors want to be compensated for the perceived increase in risk of holding bonds for 20 or 30 years. The demand versus supply challenge created by the sheer volume of debt the market is being asked to absorb is exacerbated by the changes to US bank regulation that were made after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nLoading Dimon\u2019s reference to market makers relates to the requirement that banks hold capital and liquidity against risks, with Treasury securities treated no differently to other assets. In a crisis, and a big short falling demand for a US bond issue, the banks, as \u201cprimary dealers,\u201d would be expected to step up and fill the void, but those requirements might prevent them from doing so. The Trump administration has raised the prospect of bank deregulation, with the \u201csupplementary leverage ratio,\u201d which requires banks to hold a minimum 3 per cent of common equity relative to their total assets, likely to be lowered. Dimon isn\u2019t the only senior Wall Street figure worried about the potential for an implosion in the bond market.\n\nSpeaking at the same Reagan National Economic Forum in California as Dimon, former Goldman Sachs president and Trump adviser in his first term, Gary Cohn, said that the US has \u201cthe most robust debt market in the world, until we don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIf there lacks interest from foreign investors, and there lacks interest from US investors...rates will move out dramatically. \u201cOne or two auctions later, you could be in a completely different system. \u201cAnd then, when the government gets to a point where it can\u2019t efficiently finance itself, we have a completely different position. And when we\u2019re there, it\u2019s almost too late to deal with,\u201d he said. The White House, of course, isn\u2019t concerned, arguing that growth from its tax cuts and spending will grow the economy at a rate will resolve the threat of rising deficits and debt and shrink the deficit and debt ratios.\n\nThe Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, pushed back against criticism of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act impact on the deficits and debt. \u201cThis bill is going to create growth. I\u2019m not worried about the US debt dynamics because a change in the growth trajectory takes care of a lot of that, he said, predicting that, within a year, the US economy will be growing at more than 3 per cent. That might be somewhat optimistic. Trump\u2019s tariffs, if he is allowed by the courts to impose them, or finds other mechanisms for doing so, will subtract from growth. The US dollar is under increasing pressure. It is also the case that the $US4 trillion-plus of tax cuts aren\u2019t actually stimulatory cuts, but an extension of the 2017 tax cuts that were scheduled to expire in December. Their extension might avoid what would otherwise be contractionary tax increases, but it is stretching it somewhat to see them as turbocharging growth.\n\nThere\u2019s also, given the nervousness of investors, particularly foreign investors, about the Trump administration\u2019s love of destabilising tariffs and the blow-out in government spending that would occur if the One Big Beautiful Bill is enacted, another potentially destructive element in the legislation. Section 899 of the bill would enable the US Treasury to impose penalties on foreign investors or companies by imposing punitive income and withholding taxes on them \u2013 up to 20 percentage points on their US investments \u2013 if the US deems their governments have imposed unfair taxes on US companies. Loading The European Union, the UK, Canada, Australia and others with valued-added taxes (our GST) or digital sales taxes would be obvious targets. Section 899 would apply to dividends, the interest on corporate (and possibly government) bonds and corporate profits and would also apply to the holdings of sovereign wealth funds that are currently exempt from taxes.\n\nThere\u2019s already a \u201cSell America\u201d trade underway. Even as US bond yields have risen, the US dollar has fallen almost 10 per cent this year, a reversal of the normal correlation. Trump\u2019s trade wars and the expected spending binge and deterioration in America\u2019s public finances \u2013 a prospect that saw the US lose its last AAA credit rating last month \u2013 are the reasons there have been outflows of capital from the US this year. If Section 899 were enacted \u2013 or if foreign investors thought it was likely to be enacted \u2013 there would be a real exodus of capital from the US. Interest rates would spike even more and investment and growth would shrink. The prospect of US Treasury calling a bond auction where no-one turned up would strengthen. If no-one wants to buy US assets, or are scared away from the US markets and economy by the administration\u2019s policies, the dollar won\u2019t remain dominant and America will never be great again. Trump and his administration want to bully the rest of the world. They want to dictate other countries\u2019 trade, tax and social policies while still seeking their investment \u2013 indeed, demanding that they invest more \u2013 to \u201cmake America Great Again.\u201d",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Deep under an inner-city Sydney suburb, two giant caverns each large enough to house an A380 superjumbo\u2019s fuselage and tail are being carved out of sandstone. About 120 metres long, 26 metres high and 18 metres wide, the caverns illustrate the monumental scale of the task confronting engineers and other workers as they prepare to dig two motorway tunnels under Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton. For the last decade, Sydney has become accustomed to tunnelling for metro train lines. Yet, two giant tunnelling machines to be shipped in parts from China later this year will dwarf those that completed Sydney\u2019s first under-harbour rail crossing early this decade and are now worming their way under the city for the Metro West rail line between the central city and Parramatta. At about 16 metres in diameter, the tunnel boring machines for the $7 billion Western Harbour Tunnel will be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. The twin three-lane wide motorway tunnels will each be large enough to fit four metro rail tunnels. While the project is the envy of tunnellers around the world, Transport for NSW project director Simon Cooper said the planned under-harbour crossing was \u201cvery, very complicated technically\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re building little cities underground that nobody is ever going to see that will enable our project. And when all the work\u2019s done, we will pack it away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are abroad, you hear about Sydney Harbour; you hear about the bridge. An opportunity to go under a harbour as a tunneller is ... something any tunneller around the world wants to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike mobile factories, each of the boring machines will house up to 20 workers at any one time. Spanish contractor Acciona will operate the machines around the clock, slicing through about 55 metres of rock and sediment a week. Making the project more challenging, the machines will be assembled in the tight confines of the so-called launch chambers beneath Birchgrove before starting their 1.5-kilometre journey early next year under the harbour towards Waverton. Excavation equipment known as road-headers with large rotating cutting heads began chiselling away at sandstone deep beneath an oval and several houses in February to create the launch chambers, which are due to be completed by the end of the year. Construction workers in one of the giant vent chambers for the Western Harbour Tunnel. Credit: Janie Barrett Cooper said it was hard enough assembling boring machines above ground where cranes could move freely, let alone in a tight space underground. In fact, the team decided to add extra height to the chambers to avoid regrets lifting parts when the assembly begins. \u201cIt is a factory down there because not only are we having to assemble and have these big cranes in there, we then also have piping that goes backwards and forwards to our slurry treatment plants,\u201d he explained. After a practice assembly in a Chinese warehouse, the parts that will make up the boring machines will arrive by ship at Glebe Island in coming months. Once offloaded, they will cover most of the waterfront area seen by motorists as they cross Anzac Bridge. When the assembly starts early next year, two 400-tonne bearings \u2013 equivalent to 200 cars \u2013 will have to be lifted into the caverns by gantry cranes. The bearings will hold the cutter heads to each of the machines, allowing them to spin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHighlighting the task ahead, the boring machines will have to tunnel through a portion of alluvial fill \u2013 a mixture of clay, silt and sand \u2013 under the harbour. Before they reach one of the riskiest parts of the tunnelling, up to 47 metres below the harbour surface, the giant machines will temporarily stop for a \u201cfreshen up\u201d, which will include changing teeth on the cutter heads. Once they resume churning through the alluvial fill, the priority will be to ensure the machines do not stop. Engineers want to avoid them getting stuck like a boring machine did under the Snowy Mountains for the federal government\u2019s multibillion-dollar pumped-hydro project. \u201cThat\u2019s something that causes me worry, which is getting stuck under the harbour because there\u2019s only one way to then get to it, which is then sinking something down,\u201d Cooper explained. \u201cIf something gets stuck or wears out, then you don\u2019t want to be going and trying to fix things in that bad ground because it\u2019s dangerous for people, and it\u2019s usually under pressure.\u201d During tunnelling for the M1 metro rail line under the harbour in 2019, bubbles rose to the water surface directly above a giant tunnelling machine, alarming senior transport officials who feared that one of the tunnels had been damaged, and possibly breached. However, it quickly turned out to be vibrations from the boring machine that had disturbed air pockets within sediment on the harbour floor. Heralding from Hong Kong, Cooper is no stranger to mega projects having worked in the UK on schemes such as the second stage of the Channel Tunnel rail link before moving in 2008 to Australia where he has been involved with Sydney\u2019s rail projects and the WestConnex motorway. \u201cGoing under the harbour is a big risk for us, especially in such a large machine. The ground conditions are not ideal. We\u2019re doing everything possible to make sure that [from the tunnel boring] selection through to how we\u2019re working ... that we can do it safely,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of boring machines represents a major U-turn on earlier plans. The previous NSW Coalition government decided to dig deeper tunnels for the main section of the motorway between Birchgrove and Waverton, ditching plans to lay large tubes in a trench on the harbour floor. At the peak of construction, about 500 people will be working underground at any one time. Apart from underground offices, about five support centres complete with kitchen facilities provide respite for workers during their breaks. \u201cTunnel environments are noisy. They have got somewhere comfortable to sit and have a real break,\u201d said delivery director Dean McAllister, who worked on the $2.6 billion Sydney Gateway motorway and the NorthConnex tunnel. Excavation equipment known as road-headers are being used to carve out massive caverns to assemble the tunnel boring machines. Credit: Janie Barrett Two other chambers each about 42 metres long and 25 metres high have already been excavated for the under-harbour crossing. One of them will house a slurry treatment plant, and the other filter pressers and centrifuges to remove water in the soil. As the boring machines burrow their way under the harbour, slurry will be pumped into their cutter heads to counteract pressure. The circulating slurry will be mixed with the excavated material and pumped back to the treatment plant. After the borers complete their job, the two giant chambers will be used to house ventilation fans to circulate air through the motorway tunnels. Loading Inside the tunnels and caverns already carved out for the project\u2019s first stage, it is noisy and humid as workers, diggers and other excavation equipment navigate the underground world. Cross passages are situated at regular intervals along the twin tunnels, which extend to a spaghetti junction at Rozelle for WestConnex. Trucks queue in the tunnels to collect spoil before emerging above ground to take their loads to development sites across the city. \u201cIt\u2019s busier than Trafalgar Square. There are so many different things going on down there,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nAdvertisement",

When we meet in a light-flooded warehouse conversion cafe in Melbourne\u2019s inner north, her song Peripheral Lover has just come out. It\u2019s only a few days since Gordi was stuck in a blizzard on the tarmac at Dallas in the US \u2013 the same city where she filmed the music video for the queer bop almost three years ago. Gordi, aka Sophie Payten, says chaos comes with life as a musician. Credit: Simon Schluter Gordi, restless with boredom, kept herself busy during the three-hour stranding by reading the absurd text exchange of a woman sitting in front. \u201cShe had the most enormous phone, and she was trying to text this person named Ginger who\u2019d obviously given her some flowers,\u201d Gordi tells me, laughing. \u201cShe was trying to say to Ginger, \u2018Instead of paying you with cash, would you accept a baby goat?\u2019 And Ginger said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a look at the last two weeks.\u201d The unexpected tends to follow globe-trotting musicians, but especially ones who, like Gordi, find it hard to settle for just one job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChaos, Chris Martin and impostor syndrome In choosing music \u2013 alongside change-making and medicine \u2013 Gordi chose chaos. It has led the 32-year-old, real name Sophie Payten, to three studio albums (the third is due for release in August), life-altering work in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, a seat on the board of the Music Australia council and, more recently, an emotional encounter with fellow singer-songwriter Chris Martin. Payten at her Melbourne favourite, CIBI. Credit: Simon Schluter The Coldplay frontman was touring Australia when Payten was invited to join local artists hanging out with him. He singled her out, saying he listened to her music. \u201cI ended up playing [Lunch at Dune] from the [new] record for him, and we had this beautiful exchange where he loved the song; he was moved to tears by it,\u201d Payten says. \u201cI only discovered [that] when I opened my eyes at the end of playing it.\u201d She had closed her eyes because she was so nervous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was amazing \u2013 and no one in the room thought to get their phone out to film it.\u201d Payten spent a few hours wrestling with what she saw as the potential cringe factor of sharing the story online, but friends convinced her to post a Reel about it on Instagram. The video has since been viewed more than 2 million times. The hesitation seems typical of Payten, who is grateful and a tad bashful in the face of her success. Our lunch at CIBI, a Collingwood favourite of Payten\u2019s, is our fourth meeting. I\u2019ve previously interviewed her about the grassroots live music initiative she set up with partner and musician Alex Lahey, Over Our Dead Body, and have gone along to a couple of their gigs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading Today, she pulls me into a hug, asking how I\u2019ve been and saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was you.\u201d Later, as I\u2019m getting stuck into a soba noodle salad, I say I\u2019ve heard Payten is about to appear on a billboard in Times Square in New York. \u201cOh, yeah, so there\u2019s actually going to be two billboards in Times Square \u2013 one for Spotify and one for Amazon Music,\u201d she says with a shrug, smiling as I interrupt her attempts at eating CIBI\u2019s special lunch plate. \u201c[It\u2019s] cool.\u201d Payten breaks into a grin when I mention Peripheral Lover. Fans are loving the song, even if it is a departure from the deep, reverberating and ethereal sound they\u2019ve come to expect from Gordi. Payten initially thought she would give it away, but it finally felt right after she reworked the chords. \u201cRight up until its release, there was a part of me which felt like, \u2018Are people going to think this is not me?\u2019 I had some weird impostor syndrome,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe soba salad at CIBI. Credit: Simon Schluter Payten explains how, in high school, she would scrawl illegible song lyrics on the tiniest notepad she could find, out of fear her classmates might discover them and stick them up around her boarding house. When it came to performing at Sunday night chapel, she would pretend her own songs were written by obscure artists. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the kind of judgment that would come from people knowing that it was mine,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to hear their feedback but from a more objective [viewpoint].\u201d Payten grew up on a farm in the NSW town of Canowindra, near Orange, but went to boarding school and university in Sydney. The city is still close to her heart, as is Melbourne, where she moved for love in 2020. She now spends her time between Brunswick in Melbourne\u2019s inner north and Los Angeles. \u201cBrunswick actually has the highest number of registered songwriters in Australia for any suburb,\u201d she says. \u201c[My parents] still work the farm. I call them in the middle of the day, and they\u2019re moving pipes, or chipping burrs, or moving a mob of sheep or whatever. I feel like you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find two other people who are closing in on 70 who work as physically hard as they do. \u201cI try to get home every few months, which is good because it is such an important place to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "\u201cSuccess helps people shift up in their marketability. And then it\u2019s about how do you make hay while the sun shines and your and your marketability is high?\u201d Berry said. \u201cFor brands, it\u2019s about how do you try and identify people on the way up ... [which] is much more affordable and appealing than having to wait until they have ultimate success \u2026 when the fees that they would charge would be astronomical.\u201d Piastri, who claimed a fifth grand prix win for the season in Spain at the weekend, inked a deal worth $41 million a year with McLaren in March, first reported in the Daily Mail UK and according to the Australian Financial Review. It was the seventh win of the Melburnian\u2019s Formula 1 career, and he leads the championship race by 10 points to his McLaren teammate Lando Norris. Formula 1 contracts often also include bonuses for podium finishes or wins, the amount of which varies depending on the driver\u2019s agreement with their team. Forbes Australia estimates Piastri made more than $17 million in bonuses last year.\n\nPiastri\u2019s lucrative new deal, which will extend beyond 2026, rocketed him to the title of highest-paid Australian sports star, and bonuses from his five wins for the season will push him even further above the second highest-paid, the NFL\u2019s Jordan Mailata. The Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle, who last year was the first Australian to play in a Super Bowl victory, earns $24 million a season, which will jump to $33 million from 2026 after signing a three-year contract extension. Piastri\u2019s spot at the top of the table was, until last year, held by NBA player Ben Simmons, who came to the end of his Brooklyn Nets contract worth more than $63 million-per-year. He signed with the Los Angeles Clippers in February for $1.7 million per season, according to Fox Sports, following years of injury and underperformance. The NBA is a boon for Australian athletes, with many of the nation\u2019s highest-paid stars playing basketball in the United States, including Josh Green, Matisse Thybulle, Dyson Daniels and Josh Giddey.\n\nGiddey is in the midst of contract negotiations, and veteran NBA reporter Brian Windhorst has speculated he could re-sign with the Chicago Bulls for about $47 million \u2013 a number that would see the 22-year-old surpass Piastri for the biggest annual salary (excluding bonuses and endorsements). \u201cThe going rate for a starting point guard in the NBA is around $30 million [$A46.8 million],\u201d Windhorst told ESPN, pointing to Immanuel Quickley on about $50 million a year. Josh Giddey is undergoing contract negotiations. Credit: AP \u201cI\u2019m sure Josh Giddey\u2019s hoping for something like that.\u201d Australia\u2019s domestic sports stars pale in comparison, despite earning more than ever. In 2024, 10 AFL players pocketed salaries of at least $1.2 million, with the likes of Richmond\u2019s Tom Lynch, Melbourne\u2019s Christian Petracca and Western Bulldogs skipper Marcus Bontempelli among the top earners this year.\n\nIn the NRL, Kalyn Ponga, Nathan Cleary and Cameron Munster are reportedly among the highest earners, around the $1.3-$1.4 million mark. Professor of International Sport Business at Victoria University Hans Westerbeek said sports such as Formula 1 and NBA were the most lucrative because of their broad, global popularity. \u201cIt\u2019s a very basic, simple marketing principle that the more eyeballs you attract, the more valuable the property is that attracts those eyeballs,\u201d he said. He said performance was crucial but a sports personality\u2019s narrative power could also give them an advantage when negotiating deals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one very big factor that drives the value up beyond their performance, and that is their ability to tell stories, to create a story about not only those 90 minutes on the racetrack, or four quarters on a football field, but everything that happens before, during and after,\u201d he said. Jordan Mailata was the first Australian to play in a Super Bowl win. Credit: AP \u201cWhen you\u2019re top of your discipline or top of your sport, your inherent value is higher than those who do not get onto the podium. Having said that, there\u2019s an increasing number of athletes who may never win an Olympic medal but still make a very healthy income because of the stories that they ... very strategically narrate on different social media platforms or in direct production with their management companies.\u201d He pointed to the meteoric rise of Australian sprint sensation Gout Gout as an example of how an athlete who captured the public\u2019s attention was quickly snapped up by brands. The 17-year-old signed an estimated $6 million deal with adidas last year.\n\n\u201cIt has this great story of a kid who suddenly is there and rivals one of the greatest of all time [Usain Bolt], and how quickly companies then jump on the bandwagon to sign him before he becomes too expensive,\u201d Westerbeek said. Australian golfer Cameron Smith is also on the rich list, his deal to join the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League reportedly topping nine figures. LIV contracts are usually excluded from salary estimations because the number of years the deals span is unknown, meaning it is possible Smith is earning more than Piastri on an annual basis. Loading \u201c[LIV] is a league fully owned by companies that directly associate with the government of Saudi Arabia, and it\u2019s very much a disrupter in what has been a very traditional sport. The Saudis have done this because they know what kind of influence a platform like golf, or F1 for that matter, has in it, in order for them to have some kind of power base in global sport,\u201d Westerbeek said. Gemba\u2019s Berry said Netflix\u2019s Drive to Survive series had broadened the popularity of motorsport, but Piastri\u2019s on- track success had helped him climb the most marketable list above the other 263 Australian athletes the organisation tracked.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Taree on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Holly Rankin is leading hundreds of volunteers to continue the clean up after the recent floods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe floods have destroyed up to 10,000 homes in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with support from the State Emergency Service, Ms Rankin says the clean up hasn't been easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people have experienced mud 1.5 meters up their walls. You know, you got dairy farmers with their entire infrastructure, their dairy farms destroyed. So you've got cows with mastitis. So over this week, we've brought together over 1000 community volunteers as part of our group, and we've been working alongside the SES to do those kind of easier to do, non dangerous jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Rankin says local residents impacted by the floods received a one-off payment of $1000 from the federal government, but she says the amount is too little to address the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thousands of families in Taree, Wingham and surrounds have lost everything, all of their belongings, all of their clothes, their furniture, their kitchens. They're living in emergency accommodation right now. So anyone who does a weekly budget knows that $1,000 will only last you a week. It's not going to get very far. These people are standing in the face of an immense financial burden.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian government's Disaster Assist website, in the first five months of the year, there were over 25 natural disasters across the nation, including Cyclone Alfred and the latest floods in New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Treasury estimates these disasters have led to a $2.2 billion decline in national economic activity in the first half of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says Australians are now in what he calls a stronger position to provide support for communities affected by natural disasters, due to lower inflation, debt and stable unemployment rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to Pradeep Philip, Lead Partner at Deloitte Access Economics, the $2.2 billion cost will be reflected in the upcoming GDP figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the government expects that the effects of Cyclone Alfred will be to shave about 0.2 per cent of GDP in the March quarter. This is because there's been damage done to a lot of assets, roads, bridges, homes. There are financial costs associated with this reduced economic activity, impacts on things like agriculture and logistics. And then third, there are social costs associated with this as people undergo enormous amount of trauma as a result of not just cyclone Alfred, but for some people, repeated severe weather events.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Philip says Australia needs a much bigger plan than existing measures to address the issues, as the costs of severe weather events continue to go up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" A few years ago, we had estimated that the cost of natural disasters in Australia would reach about $38 billion by 2050. Well, we're actually there now, right now, in Australia, the cost of natural disasters is around $38 billion a year. And by 2070 this could rise to between 73 and $94 billion a year. So these are really significant numbers, and what it means is that addressing climate change is actually an important economic issue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week the Government also announced an additional $2 million to support farmers and small businesses impacted by drought in South Australia and Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government also rolled out the Disaster Ready Fund, providing up to $1 billion funding till 2028 to help local governments and communities prepare for future natural disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Climate Council Fellow, Dr Simon Bradshaw, says the government seems to prefer spending more money on disaster recovery than adopting proactive measures to build community resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile he agrees that there have been improvements in the government's approach, he thinks more has to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We still need the federal government to produce its long awaited national adaptation plan to guide some of this effort, and also an updated national climate risk assessment to ensure we have the information and data on risks that we need.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Bradshaw says it's time to act faster to address the causes of natural disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every new fossil fuel project we approve is increasing the dangers and the costs for communities in future. So our first priority always is to be moving more quickly beyond fossil fuels, renewable energy, getting to zero emissions as soon as possible. And that's fundamental to protecting people around today, and of course, all the more future generations beyond that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Helen Boon at James Cook University has looked into four natural disasters in Queensland and Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer research found people who felt they were most prepared for the disasters, were often those who felt they had enough insurance and emergency kits for the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also found people who received both federal and state government support tended to feel more prepared in the wake of disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this isn't the case for everyone she says - especially for those on low incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's really important that the government will ensure that insurance cover is available at reduced rates for those whose incomes are too low to buy appropriate insurance for their properties. I think they Should subsidise in disaster insurance for those who are in vulnerable communities, particularly those of lower income.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Key Points New research suggests the cost of living is causing people to make poor dietary choices.\n\nPoor diet is among the top causes of disease in Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, millions of tonnes of edible food are thrown away each year.\n\nJust under one in 20 Australians are making dietary choices that are consistent with Australian dietary guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to CSIRO's latest Food System Horizons report, Australians are experiencing diseases due to unhealthy diets despite a relative abundance of safe, high-quality food.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that the local value of Australian fruit production (excluding wine grapes) was $6.3 billion in 2022-23, with 2.7 million tonnes sold the same year.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the local value of vegetable production was $5.8 billion, with 3.6 million tonnes sold.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of large quantities of fresh food remaining unused, 33 million tonnes of organic waste are generated each year.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE I thought I was following healthy habits \u2014 then I realised they were causing me harm\n\nThe CSIRO's report estimates that Australia's production, distribution and consumption of food is worth $800 billion and employs around 3.5 million people.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut researchers say it's not delivering for everyone, and that lack of affordable and nutritious food is a leading cause of disease in the nation.\n\n\n\nLack of choice driving poor diets\n\nLarelle McMillan, research director of CSIRO's agriculture and food sustainability program, said the cost of food and health issues is \"hitting Australians hard\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said a lack of choice is partially responsible for this situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Health-related epidemics and issues are often interpreted as an acceptable consequence of personal choice,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, there are elements to that personal choice that can lead us away from healthy food.\"\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News In particular, the cost of healthy food (like fruit and vegetables) compared to processed ones can make a nutritious diet out of reach for Australians on a smaller budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople living in regional and remote areas are more likely to see higher prices at the checkout and have fewer options available, which could influence their food choices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, 6 per cent of those in regional areas only have access to a single food retailer, and that figure rises over five times to 34 per cent for residents in remote areas.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Watchdog unveils proposal to end supermarket price-gouging, shrinkflation\n\nThese factors are contributing to a vast number of Australians not getting enough nutrition in their diet, which is leading to health consequences, the report says.\n\n\n\n\n\nLess than 5 per cent of Australians are eating enough fruits and vegetables as recommended in the federal government's Australian dietary guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison, twice as much non-essential or \"discretionary food\" like biscuits and processed meat is being consumed.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lack of nutrition in one's diet can contribute to risks such as obesity, among other health issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nDietary risk is one of the leading factors contributing to disease burden in the country, according to data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News While cost is a driving factor in food insecurity, convenience also plays a role in how consumers choose to shop in the modern age.\n\n\n\nConvenience over nutrition\n\nLilly Lim-Camacho, a principal research scientist at CSIRO, explained that convenience can drive our habits when it comes to what we buy for our meals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it comes to purchasing food, buying fresh food to prepare yourself isn\u2019t as convenient when compared to other things,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In addition, it can be seen as expensive, not only because of the increased cost but the increased time that goes into preparing food.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environments we are exposed to when buying food also play a part, as people can be swayed by marketing, she added.\n\n\n\nThe CSIRO report highlights that fast food outlets are heavily concentrated in areas of socio-economic disadvantage and around schools, which could be driving poor dietary patterns among these groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, children's exposure to fast food advertisements can affect what they want to eat afterwards,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report added that people who are living with socio-economic disadvantage within regional and remote areas faced the biggest harms of food insecurity.\n\n\n\nFresh, healthy food thrown away each year\n\nAustralian food relief charities that assist people in accessing affordable and nutritious food say the cost of living remains a major barrier to healthy eating.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, millions of tonnes go to landfills each year, according to Foodbank Australia.\n\n\n\n\"Australia wastes over 7.6 million tonnes of perfectly edible food a year,\" the charity's chief operating officer, Sarah Pennell, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to see more of that good surplus food diverted to charities like Foodbank rather than landfill. With the right incentives and infrastructure, we can dramatically reduce waste and boost food relief efforts.\"\n\n\n\nWhat could change?\n\nFood charity Second Bite's CEO, Daniel Moorfield, told SBS News they rescue around 25 million kilograms of food each year, which is equivalent to 50 million meals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there is more they could do with support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We strongly support the National Food Donation Tax Incentive, which encourages more businesses to donate surplus food rather than waste it, helping to feed more Australians in need,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This straightforward policy can help deliver millions of healthy meals to Australians in need, improving food security and nutrition while advancing our national food waste reduction goals.\"\n\n\n\nOne way to encourage people to make healthy choices, according to the CSIRO, is a levy on unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, adds the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization encouraged a similar tax on sugary drinks in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nPennell said such a levy would need to be considered in the light of its impact on low-income households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would support well-thought-out policies that improve dietary health and fund food relief efforts \u2013 but only if they don\u2019t make life harder for those already struggling to afford the basics.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) started delivering aid to civilians in Gaza at the end of May after aid, including food and medical supplies, was blocked from entering for almost three months by Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAid is much needed as the entire population is at risk of famine and one in five people in Gaza are facing starvation according to the United Nations (UN).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is criticism that the delivery of aid by GHF politicises and militarises aid.\n\n\n\nWho is behind the GHF?\n\nThe Israeli government developed the plan for the GHF when it was initially touted at the start of 2025, but the UN strongly rejected it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut amid weeks of no aid entering the enclave due to Israel blocking access, the United States backed the newly created GHF to oversee aid distribution.\n\n\n\nThe foundation's aid is overseen by Israeli troops before being delivered by contracted US security personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nA source familiar with the plan told Reuters the foundation had received more than US$100 million ($155 million) in commitments ahead of beginning operation, but it was not immediately clear where the money was coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has since been formed and started delivering aid on 26 May.\n\n\n\nHow aid has historically been delivered around the world\n\nMudasser Siddiqui, deputy CEO of humanitarian organisation Plan International Australia, told SBS News local organisations usually led the response to humanitarian situations on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose groups are supported by international organisations such as Plan International, while overall coordination was done by the UN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This makes sure there is coordination with the aid community as well as with the government and any other actors on the ground,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Three videos highlight 'heartbreaking' desperation for Gaza aid\n\nSiddiqui said the creation of a separate model completely disregards the well-established processes and procedures that already exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The existing architecture of [humanitarian aid] has decades of experience delivering assistance across the globe, including in occupied Palestinian territories over the decades to communities and people in need,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is unprecedented in this form, the removing of UN and other international and national actors has not happened before.\"\n\n\n\nHow had aid previously been delivered in Gaza?\n\nIsrael stopped all aid deliveries to Gaza on 2 March after accusing Hamas of stealing aid, which the Palestinian militants deny.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt that point, the Israeli government also demanded the release of all remaining hostages taken during the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the conflict, the UN had provided aid to the region under challenging circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN described its humanitarian operation in Gaza as opportunistic \u2014 facing problems with Israel's military operation, access restrictions by Israel into and throughout Gaza and looting by armed gangs.\n\n\n\nMudasser Siddiqui from Plan International Australia says well-established humanitarian structures have been utilised around the world, and there was no need for a new model. Source: Supplied Siddiqui said there were international mechanisms in place that could be used for robust monitoring to investigate and respond to such allegations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN has said its aid distribution system worked and that this was particularly proven during a two-month ceasefire, which was abandoned by Israel in mid-March.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael would first inspect and approve aid before it was dropped off on the Gaza side of the border, where it was picked up by the UN and distributed.\n\n\n\nHow does GHF operate?\n\nThe foundation is initially operating from four distribution sites \u2014 considerably fewer than the 400 points the UN had distributed aid from before Israel's blockade.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is understood that Israeli military personnel oversee the supplies until they are handed over to US security personnel to distribute in Gaza.\n\n\n\nIsrael has agreed to expand the number of distribution sites and explore ways to deliver aid to civilians who are unable to reach a distribution site, the foundation has stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the foundation has faced criticism from humanitarian groups for its limited reach and nature of the supplies it is set to provide, Alex de Waal, executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the US-based Tufts University, said it was \"better than nothing\".\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Waal, who writes on humanitarian issues and conflict, said the strategy behind the plan appeared to be aimed at providing just enough aid to Gaza's civilian population in an attempt to more precisely target Hamas and its operatives with starvation.\n\n\n\nConcerns about aid delivery\n\nIt is understood that the plan GHF is delivering would only allow aid to feed around 60 per cent of the estimated Gaza population.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN says the US-backed distribution plan does not meet its long-held principles of impartiality, neutrality and independence.\n\n\n\nUN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said such a model forces further displacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It exposes thousands of people to harm ... It restricts aid to only one part of Gaza, while leaving other dire needs unmet. It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddiqui said the geographical reach of the four hubs was limited, as was the actual supply being provided to people in need.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, relying on this delivery model also provided little oversight of what was happening in Gaza.\n\n\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nThere were numerous reports of security issues at the aid hubs in the first week of their operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one incident, which GHF and the Israeli military have denied occurred, it was reported that 31 Palestinians died as a result of gunfire near one of the aid hubs.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Israel investigating as Gazans killed trying to access aid SBS News 02/06/2025 06:20 Play\n\nSiddiqui said the way aid was being delivered took \"no regard for the fact that this is an active conflict zone and movement of people will expose them, which is what we are seeing right now\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an example of why we need experienced entities to manage the delivery rather than replacing them with this kind of limited scheme, because the communities are being asked to walk for hours to these sites and the necessary crowd management may not be there,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAid groups want access\n\nSiddiqui said there were almost 3,000 trucks waiting at the border to Gaza, full of supplies that could aid Palestinian civilians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would like to move over and provide assistance to our partners who are right on the ground and are well connected and well aware of where the people in need go, and provide that assistance to them, they are just a few kilometres away,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our approaches have been basically restricted while the Israeli government experiments with this new scheme.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it was not that humanitarian groups were unwilling to provide assistance, but that they needed to be allowed access into Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Reuters\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "America\u2019s government finances are about to get a lot worse. The \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d currently before the US Senate, with its extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, would add more than $US3.3 trillion to that debt within a decade and (because the spending measures are front-loaded, with expenditure cuts deferred) about 1.8 percentage points to the US debt-to-GDP ratio in its first year. Trump and his administration risk isolating America as they look to bully the rest of the world. Credit: Bloomberg Concern about the increase in debt the bill would generate, along with the chaos created by Trump\u2019s tariffs, have already caused US bond yields to rise significantly and produced some weakness in demand in auctions of bonds with longer durations. Bond investors want to be compensated for the perceived increase in risk of holding bonds for 20 or 30 years. The demand versus supply challenge created by the sheer volume of debt the market is being asked to absorb is exacerbated by the changes to US bank regulation that were made after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nLoading Dimon\u2019s reference to market makers relates to the requirement that banks hold capital and liquidity against risks, with Treasury securities treated no differently to other assets. In a crisis, and a big short falling demand for a US bond issue, the banks, as \u201cprimary dealers,\u201d would be expected to step up and fill the void, but those requirements might prevent them from doing so. The Trump administration has raised the prospect of bank deregulation, with the \u201csupplementary leverage ratio,\u201d which requires banks to hold a minimum 3 per cent of common equity relative to their total assets, likely to be lowered. Dimon isn\u2019t the only senior Wall Street figure worried about the potential for an implosion in the bond market.\n\nSpeaking at the same Reagan National Economic Forum in California as Dimon, former Goldman Sachs president and Trump adviser in his first term, Gary Cohn, said that the US has \u201cthe most robust debt market in the world, until we don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIf there lacks interest from foreign investors, and there lacks interest from US investors...rates will move out dramatically. \u201cOne or two auctions later, you could be in a completely different system. \u201cAnd then, when the government gets to a point where it can\u2019t efficiently finance itself, we have a completely different position. And when we\u2019re there, it\u2019s almost too late to deal with,\u201d he said. The White House, of course, isn\u2019t concerned, arguing that growth from its tax cuts and spending will grow the economy at a rate will resolve the threat of rising deficits and debt and shrink the deficit and debt ratios.\n\nThe Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, pushed back against criticism of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act impact on the deficits and debt. \u201cThis bill is going to create growth. I\u2019m not worried about the US debt dynamics because a change in the growth trajectory takes care of a lot of that, he said, predicting that, within a year, the US economy will be growing at more than 3 per cent. That might be somewhat optimistic. Trump\u2019s tariffs, if he is allowed by the courts to impose them, or finds other mechanisms for doing so, will subtract from growth. The US dollar is under increasing pressure. It is also the case that the $US4 trillion-plus of tax cuts aren\u2019t actually stimulatory cuts, but an extension of the 2017 tax cuts that were scheduled to expire in December. Their extension might avoid what would otherwise be contractionary tax increases, but it is stretching it somewhat to see them as turbocharging growth.\n\nThere\u2019s also, given the nervousness of investors, particularly foreign investors, about the Trump administration\u2019s love of destabilising tariffs and the blow-out in government spending that would occur if the One Big Beautiful Bill is enacted, another potentially destructive element in the legislation. Section 899 of the bill would enable the US Treasury to impose penalties on foreign investors or companies by imposing punitive income and withholding taxes on them \u2013 up to 20 percentage points on their US investments \u2013 if the US deems their governments have imposed unfair taxes on US companies. Loading The European Union, the UK, Canada, Australia and others with valued-added taxes (our GST) or digital sales taxes would be obvious targets. Section 899 would apply to dividends, the interest on corporate (and possibly government) bonds and corporate profits and would also apply to the holdings of sovereign wealth funds that are currently exempt from taxes.\n\nThere\u2019s already a \u201cSell America\u201d trade underway. Even as US bond yields have risen, the US dollar has fallen almost 10 per cent this year, a reversal of the normal correlation. Trump\u2019s trade wars and the expected spending binge and deterioration in America\u2019s public finances \u2013 a prospect that saw the US lose its last AAA credit rating last month \u2013 are the reasons there have been outflows of capital from the US this year. If Section 899 were enacted \u2013 or if foreign investors thought it was likely to be enacted \u2013 there would be a real exodus of capital from the US. Interest rates would spike even more and investment and growth would shrink. The prospect of US Treasury calling a bond auction where no-one turned up would strengthen. If no-one wants to buy US assets, or are scared away from the US markets and economy by the administration\u2019s policies, the dollar won\u2019t remain dominant and America will never be great again. Trump and his administration want to bully the rest of the world. They want to dictate other countries\u2019 trade, tax and social policies while still seeking their investment \u2013 indeed, demanding that they invest more \u2013 to \u201cmake America Great Again.\u201d",

She said she had the ring resized, but it did not fit again within a short period. \u201cI consulted with Dr Google,\u201d she said.\n\nDefence counsel Colin Mandy, SC, outside court.

I\u2019d had an ovarian cyst myself in about 2002 and my daughter had an ovarian mass when she was a baby.\u201d\n\nPatterson said her daughter would cry for long periods of time, so she took the child to doctors, who told her she was an \u201coveranxious mother\u201d and she should relax. \u201cShe was eight months old by the time it was actually diagnosed,\u201d she said of her daughter\u2019s ovarian mass.\n\nPatterson said she discovered the mass while massaging her daughter\u2019s abdomen after a bath in August 2013.\n\n\u201cThey still dismissed me, even then.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Deep under an inner-city Sydney suburb, two giant caverns each large enough to house an A380 superjumbo\u2019s fuselage and tail are being carved out of sandstone. About 120 metres long, 26 metres high and 18 metres wide, the caverns illustrate the monumental scale of the task confronting engineers and other workers as they prepare to dig two motorway tunnels under Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton. For the last decade, Sydney has become accustomed to tunnelling for metro train lines. Yet, two giant tunnelling machines to be shipped in parts from China later this year will dwarf those that completed Sydney\u2019s first under-harbour rail crossing early this decade and are now worming their way under the city for the Metro West rail line between the central city and Parramatta. At about 16 metres in diameter, the tunnel boring machines for the $7 billion Western Harbour Tunnel will be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. The twin three-lane wide motorway tunnels will each be large enough to fit four metro rail tunnels. While the project is the envy of tunnellers around the world, Transport for NSW project director Simon Cooper said the planned under-harbour crossing was \u201cvery, very complicated technically\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re building little cities underground that nobody is ever going to see that will enable our project. And when all the work\u2019s done, we will pack it away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are abroad, you hear about Sydney Harbour; you hear about the bridge. An opportunity to go under a harbour as a tunneller is ... something any tunneller around the world wants to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike mobile factories, each of the boring machines will house up to 20 workers at any one time. Spanish contractor Acciona will operate the machines around the clock, slicing through about 55 metres of rock and sediment a week. Making the project more challenging, the machines will be assembled in the tight confines of the so-called launch chambers beneath Birchgrove before starting their 1.5-kilometre journey early next year under the harbour towards Waverton. Excavation equipment known as road-headers with large rotating cutting heads began chiselling away at sandstone deep beneath an oval and several houses in February to create the launch chambers, which are due to be completed by the end of the year. Construction workers in one of the giant vent chambers for the Western Harbour Tunnel. Credit: Janie Barrett Cooper said it was hard enough assembling boring machines above ground where cranes could move freely, let alone in a tight space underground. In fact, the team decided to add extra height to the chambers to avoid regrets lifting parts when the assembly begins. \u201cIt is a factory down there because not only are we having to assemble and have these big cranes in there, we then also have piping that goes backwards and forwards to our slurry treatment plants,\u201d he explained. After a practice assembly in a Chinese warehouse, the parts that will make up the boring machines will arrive by ship at Glebe Island in coming months. Once offloaded, they will cover most of the waterfront area seen by motorists as they cross Anzac Bridge. When the assembly starts early next year, two 400-tonne bearings \u2013 equivalent to 200 cars \u2013 will have to be lifted into the caverns by gantry cranes. The bearings will hold the cutter heads to each of the machines, allowing them to spin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHighlighting the task ahead, the boring machines will have to tunnel through a portion of alluvial fill \u2013 a mixture of clay, silt and sand \u2013 under the harbour. Before they reach one of the riskiest parts of the tunnelling, up to 47 metres below the harbour surface, the giant machines will temporarily stop for a \u201cfreshen up\u201d, which will include changing teeth on the cutter heads. Once they resume churning through the alluvial fill, the priority will be to ensure the machines do not stop. Engineers want to avoid them getting stuck like a boring machine did under the Snowy Mountains for the federal government\u2019s multibillion-dollar pumped-hydro project. \u201cThat\u2019s something that causes me worry, which is getting stuck under the harbour because there\u2019s only one way to then get to it, which is then sinking something down,\u201d Cooper explained. \u201cIf something gets stuck or wears out, then you don\u2019t want to be going and trying to fix things in that bad ground because it\u2019s dangerous for people, and it\u2019s usually under pressure.\u201d During tunnelling for the M1 metro rail line under the harbour in 2019, bubbles rose to the water surface directly above a giant tunnelling machine, alarming senior transport officials who feared that one of the tunnels had been damaged, and possibly breached. However, it quickly turned out to be vibrations from the boring machine that had disturbed air pockets within sediment on the harbour floor. Heralding from Hong Kong, Cooper is no stranger to mega projects having worked in the UK on schemes such as the second stage of the Channel Tunnel rail link before moving in 2008 to Australia where he has been involved with Sydney\u2019s rail projects and the WestConnex motorway. \u201cGoing under the harbour is a big risk for us, especially in such a large machine. The ground conditions are not ideal. We\u2019re doing everything possible to make sure that [from the tunnel boring] selection through to how we\u2019re working ... that we can do it safely,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of boring machines represents a major U-turn on earlier plans. The previous NSW Coalition government decided to dig deeper tunnels for the main section of the motorway between Birchgrove and Waverton, ditching plans to lay large tubes in a trench on the harbour floor. At the peak of construction, about 500 people will be working underground at any one time. Apart from underground offices, about five support centres complete with kitchen facilities provide respite for workers during their breaks. \u201cTunnel environments are noisy. They have got somewhere comfortable to sit and have a real break,\u201d said delivery director Dean McAllister, who worked on the $2.6 billion Sydney Gateway motorway and the NorthConnex tunnel. Excavation equipment known as road-headers are being used to carve out massive caverns to assemble the tunnel boring machines. Credit: Janie Barrett Two other chambers each about 42 metres long and 25 metres high have already been excavated for the under-harbour crossing. One of them will house a slurry treatment plant, and the other filter pressers and centrifuges to remove water in the soil. As the boring machines burrow their way under the harbour, slurry will be pumped into their cutter heads to counteract pressure. The circulating slurry will be mixed with the excavated material and pumped back to the treatment plant. After the borers complete their job, the two giant chambers will be used to house ventilation fans to circulate air through the motorway tunnels. Loading Inside the tunnels and caverns already carved out for the project\u2019s first stage, it is noisy and humid as workers, diggers and other excavation equipment navigate the underground world. Cross passages are situated at regular intervals along the twin tunnels, which extend to a spaghetti junction at Rozelle for WestConnex. Trucks queue in the tunnels to collect spoil before emerging above ground to take their loads to development sites across the city. \u201cIt\u2019s busier than Trafalgar Square. There are so many different things going on down there,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nAdvertisement",

When we meet in a light-flooded warehouse conversion cafe in Melbourne\u2019s inner north, her song Peripheral Lover has just come out. It\u2019s only a few days since Gordi was stuck in a blizzard on the tarmac at Dallas in the US \u2013 the same city where she filmed the music video for the queer bop almost three years ago. Gordi, aka Sophie Payten, says chaos comes with life as a musician. Credit: Simon Schluter Gordi, restless with boredom, kept herself busy during the three-hour stranding by reading the absurd text exchange of a woman sitting in front. \u201cShe had the most enormous phone, and she was trying to text this person named Ginger who\u2019d obviously given her some flowers,\u201d Gordi tells me, laughing. \u201cShe was trying to say to Ginger, \u2018Instead of paying you with cash, would you accept a baby goat?\u2019 And Ginger said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a look at the last two weeks.\u201d The unexpected tends to follow globe-trotting musicians, but especially ones who, like Gordi, find it hard to settle for just one job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChaos, Chris Martin and impostor syndrome In choosing music \u2013 alongside change-making and medicine \u2013 Gordi chose chaos. It has led the 32-year-old, real name Sophie Payten, to three studio albums (the third is due for release in August), life-altering work in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, a seat on the board of the Music Australia council and, more recently, an emotional encounter with fellow singer-songwriter Chris Martin. Payten at her Melbourne favourite, CIBI. Credit: Simon Schluter The Coldplay frontman was touring Australia when Payten was invited to join local artists hanging out with him. He singled her out, saying he listened to her music. \u201cI ended up playing [Lunch at Dune] from the [new] record for him, and we had this beautiful exchange where he loved the song; he was moved to tears by it,\u201d Payten says. \u201cI only discovered [that] when I opened my eyes at the end of playing it.\u201d She had closed her eyes because she was so nervous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was amazing \u2013 and no one in the room thought to get their phone out to film it.\u201d Payten spent a few hours wrestling with what she saw as the potential cringe factor of sharing the story online, but friends convinced her to post a Reel about it on Instagram. The video has since been viewed more than 2 million times. The hesitation seems typical of Payten, who is grateful and a tad bashful in the face of her success. Our lunch at CIBI, a Collingwood favourite of Payten\u2019s, is our fourth meeting. I\u2019ve previously interviewed her about the grassroots live music initiative she set up with partner and musician Alex Lahey, Over Our Dead Body, and have gone along to a couple of their gigs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading Today, she pulls me into a hug, asking how I\u2019ve been and saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was you.\u201d Later, as I\u2019m getting stuck into a soba noodle salad, I say I\u2019ve heard Payten is about to appear on a billboard in Times Square in New York. \u201cOh, yeah, so there\u2019s actually going to be two billboards in Times Square \u2013 one for Spotify and one for Amazon Music,\u201d she says with a shrug, smiling as I interrupt her attempts at eating CIBI\u2019s special lunch plate. \u201c[It\u2019s] cool.\u201d Payten breaks into a grin when I mention Peripheral Lover. Fans are loving the song, even if it is a departure from the deep, reverberating and ethereal sound they\u2019ve come to expect from Gordi. Payten initially thought she would give it away, but it finally felt right after she reworked the chords. \u201cRight up until its release, there was a part of me which felt like, \u2018Are people going to think this is not me?\u2019 I had some weird impostor syndrome,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe soba salad at CIBI. Credit: Simon Schluter Payten explains how, in high school, she would scrawl illegible song lyrics on the tiniest notepad she could find, out of fear her classmates might discover them and stick them up around her boarding house. When it came to performing at Sunday night chapel, she would pretend her own songs were written by obscure artists. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the kind of judgment that would come from people knowing that it was mine,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to hear their feedback but from a more objective [viewpoint].\u201d Payten grew up on a farm in the NSW town of Canowindra, near Orange, but went to boarding school and university in Sydney. The city is still close to her heart, as is Melbourne, where she moved for love in 2020. She now spends her time between Brunswick in Melbourne\u2019s inner north and Los Angeles. \u201cBrunswick actually has the highest number of registered songwriters in Australia for any suburb,\u201d she says. \u201c[My parents] still work the farm. I call them in the middle of the day, and they\u2019re moving pipes, or chipping burrs, or moving a mob of sheep or whatever. I feel like you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find two other people who are closing in on 70 who work as physically hard as they do. \u201cI try to get home every few months, which is good because it is such an important place to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: BYD\n\nRising Chinese automaker BYD continues to build out its fleet of super-sized car carriers as it seeks to expand its international footprint, moving with \"unprecedented speed\" in a bid to topple Tesla as the global leader in electric vehicles.\n\nThe massive ships are the largest of their kind in the world, measuring some 220 metres long. The company's expansion of its ocean freight capabilities represents the \u201clatest battleground\u201d in China\u2019s pursuit of EV dominance, according to industry watcher Christopher Chico, who writes about the technology in his newsletter The Battery Chronicle.\n\n\"China\u2019s electric vehicle industry is entering a new phase of global expansion,\" he wrote on Monday, noting BYD's growing fleet of ro-ro (roll-on/roll-off) ships.\n\n\"This approach is about more than solving logistics delays. It reflects a broader strategy to control infrastructure, lower costs, and protect global operations from external bottlenecks.\"\n\nBYD's rapidly expanding fleet is ferrying cars around the world. Source: AP\n\nAs he pointed out, the concept of automaker-owned maritime logistics is not new with Japanese and South Korean car makers relying on their own specialised car carriers to send vehicles around the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Chinese automakers \"are scaling the model at unprecedented speed\", looking to capitalise on growing demand and replace Tesla car sales in overseas markets with a cheaper alternative as Elon Musk\u2019s political antics drive many customers away.\n\nAmong BYD's fleet is a ship that reportedly boasts a 9,200 vehicle capacity which had its maiden voyage in late April to Brazil and another ship of the same size that is yet to set sail.\n\nChinese automakers are building massive shipping fleets to export EVs around the world, following in the footsteps of Japan and South Korea.

As analysts noted this week, that run rate would put BYD on track to sell a million cars a year to overseas markets.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd it's putting incumbent \u2014 and typically more expensive \u2014 car manufacturers on notice.\n\n\"I think the people who are really in trouble are Japanese manufacturers\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ve got blinders on but they just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem.

    "text": "A giant ocean creature was discovered wrapped in chains and struggling to survive at a popular holiday beach.\n\nRescue volunteers worked for over an hour to free a manta ray they discovered had been caught in drumlines. Source: Noosa Wildlife/taylor_x_ocean\n\nWhile most Aussies were sitting down to dinner, watching TV on the couch, or out grabbing a beer at the pub, a small group of beachgoers was waist-deep in water to start the weekend. They were crowded around a manta ray, a large protected species of fish that visitors flock to Queensland\u2019s warm waters to photograph.\n\nBut what occurred in the popular tourism town of Noosa on Friday night isn't something you\u2019ll see in holiday brochures. This manta ray had rope and chain wrapped around it, and a hook deep in its mouth. Scratches around its body, and bites from tiny fish around its mouth and long lobes it uses for communication, indicate it had been unable to move for a long time.\n\nWhen wildlife rescuer William Watson arrived at the beach, his first thought was that the fish was wrapped in a boat's anchor. He worked with a group of locals for more than an hour to try and cut it free.\n\n\u201cHe was very tired and very weak. He must have been thrashing and got himself twisted around,\u201d the Wildlife Noosa founder told Yahoo News. \u201cHe had a hook through the side of his mouth, I had to pull it out backwards, because you couldn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\nManta ray entanglement linked to beach 'safety' program\n\nAs the creature slowly swam away, he began to process what had happened. The equipment that had caught the manta ray wasn\u2019t from an anchor. It appeared to have been deliberately set.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe chain and hook looked to be part of a drumline, a type of baited hook placed strategically around the coast by the state government. The purpose of these devices is to catch seven target species of shark and make beachgoers feel safe, which is important given the tourism industry has an estimated value of $33 billion a year.\n\nRelated: Queensland bureaucrats accused of \u2018sanitising\u2019 bloody act against shark\n\nHowever, Friday\u2019s incident highlights that more often than not, it\u2019s not just sharks that are being snared in drumlines and nets, but also protected species like manta rays, endangered sea turtles, and dolphins.\n\nDocumentarian and Envoy Foundation director Andre Borell told Yahoo News the problem could potentially get worse, with the Crisafulli government announcing last week it would be expanding upon a decades-old shark control program with an $88 million investment, a plan it linked to \"upholding Queensland\u2019s international tourism reputation\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anti-science. Lethal methods don\u2019t make beaches any safer\u2026 They\u2019re proclaiming it as a great step forward, but in reality, they\u2019re investing in something that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he claimed to Yahoo News.\n\nHis concerns mirror those of the RSPCA, which responded to the Crisafulli Government announcement by joining the Nets Out Now coalition and warning nets create a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d among beachgoers. \u201cThese devices are not physical barriers. Sharks can swim around or beneath them, and yet they continue to kill marine life indiscriminately, including protected species that pose no threat to humans,\u201d its head of policy Rachel Woodrow said.\n\nVolunteers worked for an hour to free the hooked manta ray. Source: Noosa Wildlife\n\nBoth also raised concerns about the legality of the expansion of the program, which in its current state has an exemption from the Commonwealth\u2019s threatened species protection laws, the EPBC.\n\nGovernment prioritising human life over wildlife\n\nQueensland's government has claimed shark controls like drumlines and nets \u201clikely\u201d lessen the chances of attacks. Its primary industries minister, Tony Perrett, said the planned expansion of the program was \u201cbig and bold\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt puts swimmer safety first, and it's the largest overhaul of funds this program has seen in over 60 years,\" he said.\n\nResponding to questions about Queensland's shark control program and bycatch of animals like manta rays, Perrett told Yahoo the government will \"prioritise the safety of people above all else.\"\n\nReferring to a report by international audit group KPMG, he said nets and drumlines are \"still the most effective way of protecting swimmers\".\n\n\u201cUntil the new technology is scientifically proven as effective at protecting beach goers as traditional methods, we will continue to invest in what keeps Queenslanders and our beaches safe,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe expansion of the shark control program will see nets installed at up to seven new locations, and they'll be checked every day, which the department of primary industries claims will improve swimmer safety and lessen bycatch.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith some of the money being directed to research, education and innovation, and the doubling of drone surveillance from 10 to 20 locations, the department said the plan \"strikes a balance\" between lethal and non-lethal methods.\n\nLooking generally at shark control in Australia, there is evidence that attacks are less likely at netted beaches. However critics argue that's because the same stretches are patrolled by lifeguards.\n\nConcern for whales as migration begins\n\nQueensland's tourism industry is already under pressure, with a major drawcard, the Great Barrier Reef severely degraded due to mass bleaching and extreme weather linked to climate change. Borell believes the shark control program will damage other ecosystems that draw holidaymakers to the Sunshine State.\n\n\u201cManta rays, dolphins, whales, turtles, everything you can picture on a tourism poster for Queensland, we\u2019re catching and killing it in the shark control program,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile shark nets cover just 0.03 per cent of Queensland's coast, because they are placed in populated areas, their impact on protected wildlife is routinely observed.\n\nSo with whales now migrating towards Queensland\u2019s warmer waters from Antarctica, it\u2019s almost certain they\u2019ll soon be seen entangled in the nets. While NSW removes its shark nets during the winter migration, Queensland keeps them in place, and mothers and their inexperienced calves are regularly caught \u2014 an average of six per year.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something that keeps Watson and his Noosa Wildlife rescue volunteers up at night.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s got anxiety over them. It\u2019s horrible. I\u2019d love to be waiting for the whales to be coming in, rather than thinking, please don\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Queensland, it is illegal for members of the public to remove drum lines or shark nets.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
