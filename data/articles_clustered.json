    "text": "The board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts voted to rename the facility after both the former president and President Donald Trump .\n\n\"The Kennedy Centre Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to name the institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Centre for the Performing Arts,\" spokeswoman Roma Daravi said in a statement, adding that the name honours Trump's work at the centre since taking over early in his second term.\n\nThe move quickly raised legal concerns as to whether the board has the authority to rename the arts institution, which Congress designated in 1964 as a memorial to the Democratic president, and met backlash from the Kennedy family.\n\nDonald Trump is the new namesake of the Kennedy Centre. (AP)\n\nTrump, who was elected chair by a newly constituted board in February, has frequently joked about calling the performing arts centre the \"Trump Kennedy Centre.\" The president's handpicked board approved his wishes at Thursday's board meeting, according to a source familiar with the matter, during which Trump also called in.\n\nAt an Oval Office event later in the day, Trump said he was \"honoured\" and \"surprised\" by the vote.\n\n\"This was brought up by one of the very distinguished board members, and they voted on it, and there's a lot of board members, and they voted unanimously,\" he said.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, the centre's website header was updated to read \"The Trump Kennedy Centre.\"\n\n\"Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X. \"The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.\"\n\nWhile the White House said the vote was unanimous, Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty, an ex-officio member of the board, said that was not the case.\n\n\"I was on that call and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions, and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted. Each time I tried to speak, I was muted,\" she said in a video posted to X.\n\nLegality concerns and Kennedy family pushback\n\nQuestions remain, however, about the legality of the board's move to rename the building, and members of the Kennedy family condemned the effort on Thursday.\n\n\"The Kennedy Centre is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,\" Joe Kennedy III, a former congressman and the great-nephew of the late president, said on X. \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.\"\n\nJack Schlossberg, a Kennedy grandson currently running for the US House in New York, also expressed concerns on social media with reports of muting during the vote.\n\nJack Schlossberg is the grandson of John F Kennedy. (AP)\n\nCongress renamed the arts centre after former President John F. Kennedy in legislation passed after his 1963 assassination, and federal law requires that the board \"assure that after December two, 1983, no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nExperts told CNN that while the board's decision Thursday was likely unlawful, it's unclear whether someone looking to challenge the move would have the legal right \u2013 known as \"standing\" \u2013 to even pursue such a case.\n\n\"There is absolutely no way they can do this legally,\" said David Super, a professor at Georgetown Law who specialises in legislation. But, he added, \"the administration is not concerning itself with laws unless it has a realistic prospect of getting sued.\"\n\nSuper said it's possible that an employee of the centre could try to bring a case challenging the renaming by pointing to a \"reputational harm\" that stems from having to put the new name on their resume, which they may claim has the potential to confuse prospective employers.\n\n\"I would not be optimistic that a court would accept that case,\" he said.\n\nThe same goes for descendants of the late 35th president, Super told CNN. \"If he were living, then he probably could sue, but I don't think it's clear that his heirs would have any right to sue on his behalf,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump hurls outrageous slur at female reporter\n\nMaria Shriver, the former first lady of California. (Getty)\n\nMaria Shriver , Kennedy's niece, called the effort to rename the memorial after Trump \"beyond comprehension\" as she spoke of her uncle's efforts to support the arts.\n\n\"He was a man who was interested in the arts, interested in culture, interested in education, language, history. He brought the arts into the White House, and he and my Aunt Jackie amplified the arts, celebrated the arts, stood up for the arts and artists,\" she said in a post on X. \"It is beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy.\"\n\nInside Trump's transformation of the arts centre\n\nThursday's vote marks the latest effort to leave Trump's mark on the Kennedy Centre.\n\nDays after returning to office, Trump announced an aggressive plan to gut the existing board of trustees and oust its chairman, the billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein. Since then, he's led an effort to reshape the institution to his taste: reshaping its leadership, securing multimillion-dollar congressional funding for renovations, and reimagining its programming.\n\nHe installed a who's who of loyalists \u2014 including new president Richard Grenell, his ambassador to Germany during his first term, who's been re-evaluating programming and targeting it \"for the masses.\" Grenell has cut the existing staff, hired political allies and mandated a \"break-even policy\" for every performance and facility rental.\n\nTrump has also touted restoration of the building's exterior marble, the interior chairs and \"fully\" renovated stages, which he says will be complete within a year.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tours the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. (AP)\n\nThe changes extend to what's onstage too, as the president has sought to enact a \"Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,\" saying the \"Trump Kennedy Centre\" is \"not going to be woke.\"\n\nTrump's impact on the institution was evident earlier this month at the 2025 Kennedy Centre Honours. The president has said he was \"98 per cent\" involved\" in picking the awardees, who ranged from Sylvester Stallone to the rock band KISS and Gloria Gaynor, among others.\n\nTrump on Thursday said that under his administration the centre has seen \"record-setting numbers\" in donors and previewed plans to get Congress to invest more money in the centre.\n\n\"We're saving the building. We saved the building. The building was in such bad shape, both physically, financially and every other way. And now it's very solid, very strong,\" he said.",

Others on the plane were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.\n\nBiffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR's three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level.

(Supplied: Facebook )\n\nRahat Masood, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales's School of Engineering and Computer Science, said there were multiple ways accounts could get taken down, including if the account was reported.\n\n\"Pushing that one report button can take a business down,\" Dr Masood said.\n\nShe said AI was also part of the decision-making process for multiple social media companies and false suspensions could happen even with highly accurate AI-models.\n\nDr Masood said training AI worked similarly to training the human brain.\n\nThrough repetition of words or images associated with inappropriate content, such as hate speech or nudity, AI learns to identify similar content in another post.\n\n\"The more information they see, the more they get trained,\" Dr Masood said.\n\nShe explained mistakes could happen if the AI system detected key words that were linked to child exploitation, such as using \"child\" and \"free\" in the same sentence.\n\nFight to overturn suspension\n\nSoon after Ms Taunton realised the accounts had been suspended, she started an appeal process which could take up to 180 days.\n\nWithin 24 hours of the ABC contacting Meta for comment, Ms Taunton received an email from the company outlining her account had been reinstated.\n\nThe family-run Forbes Bakehouse celebrated its 35-year anniversary this year. (Supplied: Giselle Taunton )\n\nIt did not confirm how the suspension occurred.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said in a statement to the ABC, \"We take action on accounts that violate our policies and people can appeal if they think we've made a mistake.\"\n\nThe ABC understands Meta relies on a combination of AI and reports to enforce guidelines.\n\nOmbudsman calls for better oversight\n\nThe ombudsman said the federal government needed to have better oversight of social media companies suspending accounts.\n\n\"There is a clear need for proper governance and platform oversight where technology is deciding what accounts warrant shut down for allegedly not meeting community standards and has the effect of denying a small business the opportunity to operate on a digital platform,\" Mr Billson said.\n\nThe federal government planned to develop dispute resolution requirements for social media companies, but it was not clear when they would be finalised.\n\nIn a statement, the federal Department of Communications said, \"Companies must ensure their processes are fair and if mistakes are made there are proper procedures in place for users to address suspended accounts.\"\n\nMs Taunton supported the call for more oversight on account suspensions.\n\n\"There should be far more accountability on companies who have that grasp on people's lives and their livelihoods and are able to rip it out from underneath them.\"",

(ABC News: Oliver Brown)\n\nFinding fun in the job\n\nMr Mitchell said he would miss many things about being a garbage truck driver, particularly the close connections he had built through conversations with locals over the years.\n\n\"If [older people] are out, we have a chat and it's just unbelievable how you get a rapport with them,\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\n\" It makes their day when you pull up for a chat \u2026 might get you behind in your run, but [I] wouldn't have it any other way. \"\n\nHe said another highlight had been the many colourful costumes he had donned behind the wheel, including the distinctive red suit and beard of Santa Claus during the festive season.\n\n\"It puts a bit of fun in the job, people laugh and the kids just love it, they come out and wave,\" he said.\n\n\"One young lass [gave] me a [homemade] Christmas card last week \u2026 it's going to stick in my mind for the rest of my life.\"\n\nMark Mitchell says he is proud of the many connections he has made over the decades behind the wheel.

(ABC News: Oliver Brown)\n\n\"I think the time that's put in over those 45 years, there's some stories for him to tell,\" he said with a knowing chuckle.\n\nCouncil general manager Jay Nankivell said while the town's isolated location was often seen as a disadvantage, it also meant staff had a genuine investment in their work.\n\n\"We're all part of the Broken Hill community, and everyone naturally wants to see things done right for the city they live in,\" he said.\n\nJay Nankivell believes regional council staff enjoy a closer relationship with their communities.

(ABC News: Oliver Brown)\n\nMs McLaughlin said seeing her son grow up idolising an essential community service was a testament to the garbage truck drivers in town.\n\n\"All of [the drivers] have been really good with [Liam] over the years ... to have that attention and focus and connection with him has been really lovely to see,\" she said.\n\n\" I think our Wednesdays are going to be very different moving forward, [there's some] big shoes to fill. \"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Mitchell, who is looking forward to a few more sleep-ins and golf days in the near future, said his secret to building close connections between council and community was mutual respect.\n\nMark Mitchell says he has plenty to look forward to in retirement.

(ABC South West WA: Jacqueline Lynch)\n\nJo and David Dimov signed up with a subsidiary of Perth builder BGC Housing Group in late 2022.\n\nThey were \"pretty excited\" when the slab went down on their block, north of Bunbury, in January last year.\n\n\"It was exciting to see the earthworks happen \u2026 [and] to see the bobcat get in there and start digging it up,\" said Mr Dimov.\n\n\"It started to take some shape and looked like things were going to kick off pretty quick.\"\n\nBut nearly two years later, they are still waiting to move in.\n\n\"I have seen entire subdivisions go up in the time our house has been built,\" he said.\n\nJo and David Dimov say it has been a stressful two years building their home, north of Bunbury.

Rachin Ravindra was 4 not out.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s Devon Conway.

That remained his highest score through 58 innings until he finally surpassed it on Friday.\n\nDevon Conway and Rachin Ravindra of New Zealand avoid a bird during day two. Credit: Getty Images\n\nNew Zealand was 334-1 when the second day began, with Duffy 9 not out. Duffy hit two early boundaries before being caught by wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach off Jayden Seales when the total was 350.\n\nThat brought out Williamson who was padded up for all of the first day and in total for 93.5 overs, waiting for his turn to bat. When it came, he was rusty at times, playing and missing and battling timing issues early in his innings. But he survived 60 balls and hit five boundaries in his 31 until he was out driving at a ball on a tempting length which just moved away and flicked the outside edge.\n\nConway also had trouble at times against a depleted West Indies attack. Kemar Roach is out of action at least for the rest of the second day with a hamstring issue.\n\nConway was dropped on 206 by Kavem Hodge at short cover off Roston Chase and took chances at times by leaving on length balls which passed close to or over his off stumps. Still, New Zealand\u2019s total passed 400 in 111 overs.\n\nConway spoke to media after stumps on the first day after the difficult task of opening the batting, especially in New Zealand.\n\nOpening \u201cis a very underappreciated job around the world, not just here,\u201d Conway said. \u201cYeah, it has been a tough ride.

    "text": "With many Australians hoping for further interest rate cuts and more potential relief from the cost of living crisis, a new forecast has raised fears financial struggles could be exacerbated next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of Australia's 'big four' banks have dismissed the possibility of a rate cut in 2026, with two of them forecasting at least one increase early in the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank has predicted cash rates will rise by 0.25 per cent in the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) first meeting next year in February, while National Australia Bank has predicted a 0.5 per cent rise in two separate hikes in February and May.\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at financial comparison website Canstar, told SBS News: \"[It] will be important to see how inflation is tracking, if it's still tracking in the wrong direction ... Then the RBA could choose to hike the cash rate based on that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she also reminded Australians \"It's important to remember that these are just forecasts. They're not set in stone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'big four' banks have dismissed the possibility of a rate cut next year. Source: SBS News Westpac, which previously forecast one rate cut in 2026, is the last major bank to rule out the possibility, forecasting, along with ANZ, that rates will remain unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the RBA meeting in December, when rates were left unchanged, governor Michele Bullock also warned about a possible hike next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Bullock] was putting Australian borrowers on notice, particularly those with a variable mortgage, that their mortgage rates and their monthly repayments could potentially be on the way up rather than on the way down in 2026,\" Tindall said.\n\n\n\n'Renewed' cost of living crisis\n\nBullock's announcement came as many banks and economists expected further rate cuts before the surprise inflation number, which was released in late November.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics data showed inflation across the 12 months to October jumped 3.8 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in September.\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage holders may have been negatively affected by the element of surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMP chief economist Shane Oliver told SBS News: \"People with mortgages were feeling more optimistic about things because they'd seen three rate cuts and there were expectations for more.\"\n\n\n\nBut now mortgage holders will be feeling pessimistic, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2022, interest rates have increased 13 times, while there have only been three rate cuts, leading to larger mortgages for homeowners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mortgage these days is, in many cases, the biggest component in a household budget,\" Oliver said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the interest rates start going back up again, then they can have a big dampening impact on spending and lead to renewed talk about a cost of living crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As interest rates go up, you would feel your cost of living rising again.\"\n\n\n\nPaying more in the supermarkets\n\nBut mortgage holders will not be the only group that might be impacted with experts warn a potential rise in interest rates could affect consumer goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Grant, an associate professor of finance at the University of Sydney Business School, suggests higher inflation may lead to a cycle of rising interest rates, forcing businesses to pass those costs on to consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The real question is around the degree to which this happens,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\"For people who are just not worried about the cost of housing, whether they own their house already or they're not intending to participate in the rental market, it will just mean that probably the inflation is gonna flow through to the cost of everyday items,\" Grant said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rents go up for business owners, and they'll have to charge more for customers, as they need to overcome the cost of living themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said this pattern might impact \"a large proportion of the population that are living pay cheque to pay cheque\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Increasing interest rates or increasing inflation might mean that they're paying a little bit more at the supermarket each week, they're paying a little bit more for their electricity and energy bills, and other utilities,\" Grant said.\n\n\n\nCost pressures push more Australians into hardship\n\nFinder's Cost of Living Pressure Gauge \u2014 which tracks the financial burden on Australian households monthly \u2014 shows a significant jump in financial stress from 57 per cent in October 2019 to 77 per cent in October 2025.\n\n\n\nA June report from Anglicare Australia also paints a stark picture of how little is left after basic expenses for some workers. A full-time minimum wage worker has just $33 remaining after paying for rent, food and transport, according to the report. A single parent on the minimum wage is left with just $1, even with government assistance, while a household with two full-time workers and two children has only $5 left each week.\n\n\n\n\n\nKasy Chambers, executive director of Anglicare Australia, said any increase in the cost of living will \"affect people on the lowest incomes\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are basically seeing poverty climbing the income ladder ... And that's the difficulty that we're seeing, and that's what we'll see more of,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we'll be seeing this get worse for more families before we see it get better, because the only thing we can really rely on to make a big difference is housing costs, and they don't seem to be going anywhere quickly.\"\n\n\n\n",

So they're intended to be a clear line in the sand that says anything below this isn't good enough.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLis Ashby spent 15 years working within state and federal governments on biodiversity policy and regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's now the Biodiversity and Innovation Lead at the Biodiversity Council, which brings together experts from 11 universities.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Ashby says the legally-enforcable standards are designed to provide the clarity conservation groups and business groups have been calling for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if you are a developer or a proponent who's going to have a large impact on biodiversity, a really clear standard might make you go, 'oh, it's not worth my time preparing an application or buying this property to develop it because the biodiversity impact is so significant that I know that it's going to be rejected.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Environmental Standards were the cornerstone of Professor Graeme Samuel's review into the omnibus Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (or EPBC) Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis landmark review formed the blueprint for the reforms, which aim to protect nature while speeding up project approvals, partly by reducing duplication between jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft documents outlining two of five promised standards have now been published.\n\n\n\n\n\nInnes Willox says the Australian Industry group is happy with where the conversation is headed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, the first two standards we've seen, the drafts are looking directionally okay. There is more to come. There'll be the subject of further consultation among different groups and interest groups. As we work through the process. We don't think this is easy or straightforward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's right. Environmental groups have raised concerns with the draft standard that covers Matters of National Environmental Significance - like threatened species and ecological communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Brendan Wintle is an ecologist with the University of Melbourne Biodiversity Institute, and a lead councillor with the Biodiversity Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So one of the things that was suggested or recommended through the decadal review of the EPBC Act is that we actually have outcomes based standards, and that we require environment-related outcomes, and those need to be measurable outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the draft standard for Matters of National Environmental Significance - which include things like threatened species and world heritage properties - are too subjective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the moment, the wording under the draft standards for MNES, for example, says things like 'provide for the protection and conservation' or 'contribute to the enhancement of a matter' - you know, habitat for a threatened species, for example - but you can provide a way, you can contribute all sorts of things and never actually improve the outcome for the species or for the ecosystem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Wintle says the wording needs to be clearer and more quantitative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I mean, these are incredibly vague concepts. We can do much better than that.\" TEE: \"Give me some examples of how you quantify that and make it tight.\" WINTLE: \"Yeah. So we would say if you are reducing the abundance of a threatened or critically endangered species, if you are reducing the area of a threatened ecological community, if you are degrading the condition of a threatened ecological community - and these things we can measure. They're areas of habitat, they're areas of ecological community, they're numbers of animals, there's areas of habitats for those critically endangered animals, and we can set thresholds on what's an unacceptable loss, and then we can measure whether or not you've achieved a positive outcome in the area and condition of those matters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMany conservationists worry the new laws leave too much to the discretion of the environment minister, who ultimately determines whether a project gets approved.\n\n\n\n\n\nANU ecologist Davide Lindenmayer says he's doing work with the government to support the new standards, but he's deeply concerned they won't be effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not clear to me what a national environmental standard actually will be because we are dealing with very diverse systems in Australia, often with many endangered species and threatened species, and often the process of logging has multiple threats associated with it. For example, when we log a forest, we make it more flammable and that means that animals and plants are threatened not only by the logging itself, but also by the extra fire risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInnes Willox says that business, on the other hand, doesn't want the laws to be too prescriptive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There will always be those who want rigidity as it were, and others who want a little bit of flexibility. I think from business's perspective, we have to understand that each scenario or each case where this law is going to be applied will be different. There will be some very clear obvious cases around what is and isn't permissible, but there's always in this going to be some shades of grey and we would caution against being too prescriptive because each case is different and each scenario is different.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation Executive Director Lyndon Schneiders accepts there are limits to how prescriptive the test in the standard can be.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he believes the compromise Labor and the Greens reached to pass the laws also elevated important elements beyond the status of regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some of the key concepts have now been hardwired into the legislation itself. Probably one of the most important is this idea around unacceptable impacts of development on the MNES, and that has now been put in the primary legislation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe definition of 'unacceptable' has been criticised as overly ambiguous from both sides - which Environment Minister Murray Watt argues means the government got it right.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment groups have also raised concerns there are loopholes in the offset standard - which provides a pathway to compensate for damage that can't be avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards for information and data, First Nations engagement and community consultation will be put out for consultation once they've been developed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLyndon Schneiders says the real work starts now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got a new framework, we've got the resources in place, we've got the institutions in place, we've got a new rule set, but the real work is now going to be translating that into concrete action, and that's ahead of everyone over the next 18 months 24 months as we set up a system that's going to work.\"\n\n\n\n",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nNew Zealand leads the three-match series 1-0 after the first test was drawn and the Black Caps won the second by nine wickets.\n\nConway resumed at 178 after batting through all of the first day on which he shared a 323-run opening partnership with Tom Latham who made 137.\n\nHe reached his double century after more than seven hours at the crease, from 316 balls and with 28 fours.\n\nConway made a double century in the first innings of his first test against England in June 2021, immediately after qualifying to play for New Zealand on residential grounds. That remained his highest score through 58 innings until he finally surpassed it on Friday.\n\nDevon Conway and Rachin Ravindra of New Zealand avoid a bird during day two. Credit: Getty Images\n\nNew Zealand was 334-1 when the second day began, with Duffy 9 not out. Duffy hit two early boundaries before being caught by wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach off Jayden Seales when the total was 350.\n\nThat brought out Williamson who was padded up for all of the first day and in total for 93.5 overs, waiting for his turn to bat. When it came, he was rusty at times, playing and missing and battling timing issues early in his innings. But he survived 60 balls and hit five boundaries in his 31 until he was out driving at a ball on a tempting length which just moved away and flicked the outside edge.\n\nConway also had trouble at times against a depleted West Indies attack. Kemar Roach is out of action at least for the rest of the second day with a hamstring issue.\n\nConway was dropped on 206 by Kavem Hodge at short cover off Roston Chase and took chances at times by leaving on length balls which passed close to or over his off stumps. Still, New Zealand\u2019s total passed 400 in 111 overs.\n\nConway spoke to media after stumps on the first day after the difficult task of opening the batting, especially in New Zealand.\n\nOpening \u201cis a very underappreciated job around the world, not just here,\u201d Conway said. \u201cYeah, it has been a tough ride. Quite often you rock up day one of a test match and you see it\u2019s pretty green.\n\n\u201cAlready mentally you think, well, it\u2019s going to do bits here on this pitch. I think a lot of credit needs to go to a guy like Tom Latham, who\u2019s played 90-odd tests and has done so well.\u201d\n\nA short time ago New Zealand were 5-485.\n\nAP",
