(Supplied)\n\nHe wants people to know gambling addiction doesn't discriminate and can affect people from all walks of life.\n\nBut he finds the common thread between people with a gambling addiction is they often find themselves in \"a very lonely place\".\n\n\"There's nothing social about it and it's their own little secret,\" he said.\n\n\"That's the thing with gambling addiction, you can't smell the cards on their breath.\"\n\nHis advice to family and friends of a compulsive gambler is to \"stop bailing them out\".\n\n\"There needs to be consequences,\" he said.\ufeff\n\n\"It needs to be tough love, it needs to be factual, you can't put sprinkles and fairy floss on top, because it just doesn't work like that.\"\n\nHenson believes there's strength in numbers when it comes to recovery.\n\n\"With numbers you're strong but if you start doing it on your own, that's where you're going to be vulnerable,\" he said.\n\n\"The first thing is to go and talk to someone.\n\n\"Don't be ashamed to put your hand up if you're struggling, it's possible to get help.\"",

    "text": "Chances are you've been to a third place at least once in your life and didn't even realise.\n\nEssentially public lounge rooms, they are social environments separate from home (first place) and work (second place).\n\nAnd while many believe they're essential, some experts say they're becoming a lot more scarce. So what are they, and are they going anywhere? \ufeff\n\nA third place could be anywhere from a coffee shop to a park. (Sydney Morning Herald)\n\nThe term \"third place\" was coined in the 1990s by \ufeffsociologist Ray Oldenburg as work hours began to increase.\ufeff\n\nHe argued that as life became busier and more secluded, these places became vital for democracy, engagement and a sense of place amongst the broader community.\ufeff\n\nThe main criteria for a spot to be a third place are pretty simple: it needs to be a neutral area that is easily accessible to and comfortable for the public.\n\nIts main purpose is for people to gather and socialise, fostering a sense of community and conversation. \ufeff\n\nREAD MORE: Three words this CEO swears will help you land a better job \ufeff\n\nThe main purpose of third spaces are to foster a sense of community with strangers. (Getty)\n\nIn a traditional sense, a third space can be anywhere from a coffee shop to a park to a library.\n\n\"Shopping centres are considered third spaces,\" creative producer at youth arts organisation OutLoud Nicole Issa said.\n\n\"Even though some people might not like it to be, it's the truth.\"\n\nShe says third places are important for social connections, particularly amongst young adults.\n\nShe also thinks they're dying out.\ufeff\n\n\"One thing that I'm hearing a lot from young people is that there is a need for third spaces and there's a need for safe places for young people to go,\" she said.\n\n\ufeff\"I think it's been a gradual thing. The biggest, major event that has changed the way young people use third space was definitely COVID...\n\nMany believe that shopping centres are also considered third place. (JOE ARMAO)\n\n\"There was like strict legislation that came in that prevented people from going to social events or even meeting up with other people, which then, in turn, just changed people's patterns.\"\n\nHowever, unlike Issa, University of Melbourne Chair of Architecture and Urban Design Kim Dovey does not believe that third spaces are dying, but rather that they never existed in Australia to begin with.\n\n\ufeff\"The concept of the third place is an American thing,\" he said.\n\n\"It sort of came out of that kind of social capital literature.\n\n\"These places are important because they're where we establish what are often known as weak ties.\n\n\"You make new friends and acquaintances, and you get to know your neighbourhood and your neighbours a bit more and people you wouldn't normally run into.\n\n\"In so many parts of the world, it's just normal everyday life. It didn't really need a name.\"\n\nThe emergence of social media has allowed for the growth of digital third places. (Getty)\n\nIn his literature, Ray Oldenburg argued that a place outside of work and home is crucial for public wellbeing.\n\n\"What suburbia cries for are the means for people to gather easily, inexpensively, regularly, and pleasurably - a 'place on the corner',\" he said.\n\nWhile brick-and-mortar shopping centres filled that need for decades, the rise of online shopping has meant people are spending less time at physical stores.\n\nThe internet \u2013 particularly social media \u2013 is a double-edged sword here. While it's given rise to digital third places, it's limited the way that people interact in public.\n\n\"I hate having to get out of the way of people who are reading their phone as they walk down the street, they're not actually present in the street,\" Professor Kim Dovey said.\n\n\"Cities work by putting lots of people you don't know into the same space that you share, and you weave in and out of each other and on busy pedestrian sidewalks.\"\n\n\"And that's how cities work, so I think social media is a threat to that.\"",

(AP)\n\nTraditional bike shops continue to hold advantages over online retailers, including expert fittings, personalised advice and a skilled repair service, but they face a shifting market. \ufeff\n\nOne example, highlighted by the IBISWorld research released in 2025, was Pedal Group's 99 Bikes chain of stores across Australia.\n\nThe company expanded rapidly, increasing its number of physical stores to boost its market share.\n\nBut since the close of the pandemic, slumping demand caused the company to deal with oversupply issues, hampering its expansion.\n\nAnd Australian cycle companies are not alone in facing a post-COVID sales slump.\n\nRemember Peloton? \ufeffThe sports company turned out millions of exercise bikes and treadmills fitted with smart technology, fuelled by demand from fitness enthusiasts who were confined to home.\n\nSales of Peloton fitness bikes boomed during the pandemic, but then fell off after lockdowns lifted. (Supplied)\n\nSales boomed during lockdowns, but Peloton's fortunes began to fade as vaccinations increased, gyms reopened and rivals offered competitive products.\n\nOnce the darling of the US stock market during COVID, by February 2022, its share price had collapsed and a painful company restructure followed, including shedding 2800 workers.\n\nThe rising popularity of e-bikes is also another challenge to sales of conventional, or analogue, bicycles.\n\n\ufeffThe technology is expanding the market by appealing to a wider range of consumers than conventional, or analogue, bikes, requiring less pedalling and easier hill-climbing.\n\nMany bike shops are now stocking e-bikes, but they've been competing with sales from private individuals and online suppliers, often spruiking powerful and illegally altered machines.\n\nE-bikes have provided both a threat and opportunity for conventional bike sales. (Jorens Seins/iStock)\n\nAustralian import regulations controls on e-bikes were relaxed in 2021, leading to a flood of such e-bikes capable of travelling at more than 50km/h.\n\nBut in December 2025, after a spate of deaths and serious injuries of e-bike riders, federal and state authorities agreed to reinstate a key import standard to define legal e-bikes.\n\nThis would include the motor cutting out at a maximum assisted speed of 25km/h. \ufeff\n\nLooking ahead, the hope is a safer and better-regulated market will create a level playing field for established bike dealers.\n\nBourke says the industry is adapting to the heady changes, but the traditional local bicycle store selling everything, from children's bikes with trainer wheels, to mountain bikes, commuter machines and racing cycles is probably on its way out.",

(ABC News)\n\n\"The economic climate we're in means that people are bargain hunting more. It is really about Australians trying to get their household budgets balanced.\n\n\"Australians are trying to have a lift and make sure they're spending money wisely at times when things might be lower in price.\"\n\nOnline shopping may keep many people at home, but the ARA said 80 per cent of purchases on Boxing Day were still made in store.\n\nBoxing Day sales face competition from Black Friday sales, but are still a major driver of retail spending. (ABC News)\n\nThe emergence of Black Friday sales has not yet made the Boxing Day sales redundant, but has helped refine its purpose for retailers.\n\n\"It's a true clearance event, Boxing Day, so retailers really have to move that stock out the door,\" Ms Brown said.\n\n\"Black Friday is growing in popularity, but it's also serving a role as that gift-buying period for Australians before Christmas.\"\n\nMs Brown also said shoppers were more likely to find a true bargain on Boxing Day than they would during the Black Friday sales.\n\n\"If you're looking for the pure percentage decrease, you might find Boxing Day in some categories is a higher percentage [reduction] and that's because those items have to move,\" she said.\n\nThere was only a modest trickle of shoppers when the Myer in Melbourne's Bourke Street Mall opened its doors on Boxing Day. (ABC News)\n\nIt was a slow start to the shopping day in Melbourne's Bourke Street Mall, with a polite trickle of shoppers entering stores rather than the stampedes of yesteryear.\n\n\"I haven't come the last few years because of the kids, COVID and all that,\" one shopper told the ABC.\n\n\"Normally, I used to come here around 5 o'clock in the morning and there used to be a queue outside and all that, but this year is a little bit quieter,\" he said.\n\nThis Melbourne shopper was out early to grab a bargain in the Boxing Day sales. (ABC News: Nate Woodall)\n\nAnother shopper said she left the family at home and came into the CBD early to get a head start on other shoppers.\n\n\"The girls are a little bit older now so they're still sleeping off the excitement of yesterday, so I came in nice and early to beat the rush,\" she said.\n\n\"There wasn't much of a rush anyway. I think everyone is shopping online.\"\n\nShoppers have also been warned not to rush in to spending money on Boxing Day on something they might regret purchasing later.\n\nUniversity of Melbourne Professor of Law, Jeannie Paterson, said it was important to consider if an advertised discount was really what it seemed.\n\n\"The first thing to do is to slow down. I think Boxing Day sales, if we've got through Christmas, often we're exhausted and we're also in a hurry to find a good deal,\" she said.\n\n\"So it's worth just stopping and thinking and considering whether it really is a discount.\n\n\"The other thing that sometimes happens of course, is that old products or lower quality products are rolled out, and there's a lot of fake products around online as well.\"",

    "text": "LawConnect and Master Lock Comanche are again two of the favourites for Line Honours this year. (Getty Images / Corbis)\n\nThe race for line honours \u2014 first across the line in Hobart \u2014 usually comes down to the supermaxis, the boats of around 100 feet or 30.48m in length.\n\nThis year there are six supermaxis in the fleet, and there is one other entry that could be in with an outside chance.\n\nLawConnect \u2014 owned and skippered by Christian Beck \u2014 is going for back-to-back line honours wins. The boat \u2014 then known as Perpetual Loyal \u2014 also took line honours in 2016. LawConnect won last year, after finishing second three straight times in 2019, 2021 and 2022.\n\nMaster Lock Comanche has been known by several names, all including Comanche. The boat is currently co-owned by Matt Allen and James Mayo, and it holds the record for the fastest finish in race history (one day, nine hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds, in 2017) and is a four-time line honours winner.\n\nAllen and Mayo managed to achieve the line honours / overall win double as part of the crew of Sovereign back in 1987.\n\nIn 2023 there was just 51 seconds between LawConnect and Master Lock Comanche in the finish in Hobart. Can these two end up fighting it out again?\n\nWild Thing 100 is owned by Grant Wharington and Adrian Seiffert, and skippered by Wharington.\n\nFormerly the 80-footer Stefan Racing, this boat was extended to supermaxi length ahead of the 2023 race. Wild Thing 100 came third for line honours and overall last year.\n\nThen there is Maritimo 100, owned and skippered by Bill Barry-Cotter. This one may be a supermaxi, length-wise, but not speed-wise. Maritimo 100 is unlikely to be challenging for line honours. There are two other supermaxis in the lists.\n\nSHK Scallywag 100 is owned by Malaysian businessman Seng Huang Lee and sailed out of Hong Kong Yacht Club. The skipper is David Witt, who will be going on his 27th Hobart this year. This is a return to the race after the boat pulled out of the Sydney to Hobart in 2023 with a broken bowsprit.\n\nThe other 100-footer is Palm Beach XI. The boat is now owned by Mark Richards, who skippered it \u2014 then known as Wild Oats XI \u2014 to a record nine line honours wins for the late Bob Oatley.\n\nThere is one other entry in the race, that isn't officially a supermaxi \u2014 but it is in contention for the line honours win.\n\nIt's Lucky, a 27m (88.6 foot) boat owned by American Byron Ehrhart and sailed out of the New York Yacht Club \u2014 you might know that name as the club that held the America's Cup for 132 years until Australia II defeated Liberty in 1983.\n\nRacing as Rambler 88 for previous owner George David, this boat finished third for line honours in the Sydney to Hobart in 2015.\n\nLucky's presence in the race adds to the intrigue for the straight race to Hobart. Let's see how they all go on day one.",

(Supplied: Narrogin Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service)\n\nDFES Assistant Commissioner Stuart Wade said the fire came within 2 kilometres of the town site on Thursday night.\n\n\"Firefighters have done an incredible job protecting homes, and at this stage we don't have any reports of property loss at either of the emergency level fires.\"\n\nHe said while conditions were favourable overnight, expected wind increases during the day will make it challenging for crews.\n\nThe fire has burnt more than 3,700 hectares. (Supplied)\n\n\"It's certainly been a challenging 48 hours for our career and volunteer firefighters, with crews working through Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and overnight,\" he said.\n\n\"Currently, we've got 40 fire appliances at Boddington, and we've got 13 aircraft available, including an air-tanker and two rotary-wing Blackhawks. They'll commence again this morning.\"\n\nHe said the fire's behaviour is erratic, with a serious risk of spot fires presented by embers.\n\n\"It has been extremely challenging, it has been erratic, the gusty winds have changed direction throughout the night.\n\n\"There's lots of fuel there, dense fuel loads, and the spotting from the fire behaviour was up to 250 metres from the fire.\"\n\nTown evacuates\n\nThe Boddington Shire President Eugene Smalberger said about 50 people fled to the evacuation centre at the Sports Pavilion in nearby town of Williams, many with animals.\n\nFire conditions have been described as \"erratic\" due to shifting winds. (Supplied)\n\n\"Everyone has seen the glow and realised that this is a serious situation and to get out,\" she said.\n\n\"There was a few of the older people that really just wanted to go back home, and we needed to explain to them that there was really no chance \u2014 just make peace with it and stay for the night.\"\n\nShe said the fire has been burning for two weeks, but flared up with the heat, starting a spotfire closer to town than anticipated.\n\n\"Unfortunately, that one was in a really rough terrain in the forest, so from the start, they couldn't fight it. So they had containment lines, but it jumped the containment lines.\"\n\n\" With the size of the flames, it's nearly impossible to fight it from the ground. \"\n\nResidents thank firies\n\nBoddington resident Mark remained in town on Thursday night to help.\n\nHe said the fire was \"racing across the hills\" and burnt a lot of timber around 5pm on Thursday night.\n\n\"Then the wind changed direction, and then it was gusting for a wee bit, but then the wind died off,\" he said.\n\n\" Obviously, all the hills are still sparkling with fires, but it could be worse. \"\n\nFirefighters managed to stop the blaze reaching the town site overnight. (Supplied: Narrogin Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service)\n\nDeputy Shire president Paul Carrotts left family Christmas in Mandurah to come home to Boddington to help out.\n\n\"There's certainly still a red glow, you look to the north towards the gold mine, there's definitely a red glow,\" he said.\n\nHe thanked the firefighters who worked all throughout Christmas Day, and the nearby town of Williams for taking in evacuated residents.\n\n\"The community can't thank them enough,\" he said.\n\nSome workers remain at mine\n\nThe ABC received reports on Thursday night that a number of workers remained at the mining camp south-east of Newmont's Boddington gold mine, near where the fire was burning.\n\nOne worker said they had initially planned to leave but had been told the evacuation had been \"cancelled\".\n\nNewmont told the ABC on Friday all workers had the option to leave, but about 70 chose to stay on site \u2014 which had been designated as a safe zone \u2014 rather than navigating roads impacted by fallen trees and power lines.\n\nNewmont said others had chosen to stay to assist firefighters.\n\nFollowing reports of delayed evacuations on Wednesday night, Newmont also clarified that DFES had determined the fire was too close to the mine's blasting zone, which contains explosives, meaning workers had to wait in the car park to be escorted.",

(ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\nThe Lilly Street lasagne bake-off in South Fremantle has been running since 1998.\n\nIn between snarky comments and hours spent over the stove refining recipes, it is a tradition as strong as the community that preserves it.\n\nThe inception\n\nFormer winner Jenny Baker is the self-proclaimed queen of lasagne. (ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\nIt all started when two neighbours on Lilly Street wanted to know who made the better lasagne, so the pair recruited their other neighbour, Jenny Baker, to be the judge.\n\n\"I just said, a bit tongue in cheek, 'Oh, they're fine, but I make a far better one,'\" Ms Baker said.\n\n\"They were like don't be ridiculous, this is the best meal we can make, and I said well bad luck, this is not good enough.\"\n\nAnd just like that, a rivalry was born, with Ms Baker as its self-proclaimed matriarch.\n\nPeople come from all over Perth to bring their own recipes to the judges. (ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\nThat year, in 1998, nine neighbours closed off the street to eat each other's lasagne \u2014 competitively.\n\n\"I won that year,\" Ms Baker said.\n\n\" And there was great rumour up and down the street that I'd done favours for the judge, but I hadn't.

    "text": "Have you received some unwanted gifts this holiday season?\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve bought a few things for yourself that you now regret.\n\nIt can feel a little awkward asking for a refund or to exchange an item, especially if you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re entitled to.\n\nIt's one of those errands you may want to avoid altogether but to make it less painful, we\u2019ve broken down what you\u2019re entitled to.\n\nFirstly, is the product faulty?\n\nYour rights really boil down to the reason for the return, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\n\"If a product is faulty, doesn\u2019t match the description, or is not fit for purpose, consumers will have rights to a remedy under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL),\" the ACCC says.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nAlso known as consumer guarantees, these rights still apply if an item was given as a gift and a \"remedy\" can include a refund, repair or replacement.\n\nBut it depends on whether the problem is considered \"major\" or \"minor\".\n\nAccording to the ACCC ordering a red bicycle and receiving a green one, an electric blanket with faulty wiring or a raincoat not being waterproof because it\u2019s made from the wrong material are all examples of major problems.\n\nIf something does not meet a consumer guarantee and you would like it refunded, repaired or replaced, \"a business can ask consumers to provide a receipt or another form of proof of purchase,\" the ACCC says.\n\n\"Other acceptable forms of proof of purchase may include a credit or debit card statement, lay-by agreement, a receipt or reference number given over the phone or internet, as well as warranty cards or serial numbers.\"\n\nCan I get a refund for change of mind?\n\nThis is where things become more nuanced.\n\nNicola Howell says whether you can return or exchange an item because of a change of mind depends on an individual business's policy. (Supplied: Queensland University of Technology)\n\nThe ACCC says consumers don't have the same rights if \"they no longer like or want a product\".\n\nWanting to return something because it's the wrong size, you found it cheaper elsewhere or you did not like the item would typically all fall under a \"change of mind\".\n\nNicola Howell, a senior lecturer at Queensland University of Technology's law school, says our consumer law does not address \"change of mind\" returns.\n\nDr Howell says it comes down to the policy the store offers. There's no obligation to have a change of mind policy, but retailers do need to be consistent if they offer one, she says.\n\nIf you're shopping for something that may need to be returned, she recommends checking the store's specific policy.\n\nThe store determines whether it allows \"change of mind\" refunds or exchanges, the return window, and the kind of proof of purchase it requires, Dr Howell says.\n\nWhat is a return window?\n\nStephanie Tonkin says change of mind returns are not guaranteed. (Supplied: Consumer Action Law Centre)\n\nWhen it comes to change of mind returns, most store policies outline the length of time a customer has to refund or exchange an item.\n\nConsumer Action Law Centre CEO Stephanie Tonkin says the ACL doesn't force businesses to offer change of mind refunds, but they are legally obligated to follow their own policy.\n\n\"If they do set a return period \u2014 14 days, 30 days, whatever \u2014 they must honour it.\"\n\nConsumer Affairs Victoria says the policy should be clearly displayed at point of sale or included on the business' website.\n\nWhat about exchanges?\n\nUnderstanding buyer's remorse Buyer's remorse is a crappy feeling. So how do we break the cycle, especially if we use spending money as a form of self-soothing or distraction?\n\nOnce again, exchanges typically fall under the individual store's policy.\n\nMs Tonkin says wanting to swap the size of an item, such as a pair of shoes or a shirt that does not fit are \"generally a change of mind, not a fault\".\n\nIf the store has a change of mind policy, such as exchanges within 14 days, \"they must stick to it\".\n\n'The store's policy never overrides the law'\n\nIt's important to remember that return windows or exchange policies can't be used to \"shut down your rights\" when it comes to faulty products, Ms Tonkin says.\n\n\"If something is broken, unsafe, or not what you were promised, your ACL rights apply regardless of any \"no refunds\" or expired return window . .\"\n\nThe ACCC says while businesses can put conditions on returns under their policies, they cannot put those same conditions on returns where products do not meet the consumer guarantees.\n\nIf you have an issue with a store, you can contact your local state or territory fair trading or consumer affairs agency for assistance, the ACCC says.",

    "text": "Firefighters have rescued an endangered native chick from a 2,000-hectare bushfire which tore through Victoria's third-largest national park and part of a neighbouring conservation reserve on the weekend.\n\nThe blaze burnt a section of the semi-arid Wyperfeld National Park which stretches more than 350,000 hectares in the north-west of the state.\n\nIt roared across the stretch of Mallee scrub in hot, windy and stormy conditions, pushing a fire front between conservationists Louise and Michael Gooch's property and the national park.\n\nMs Gooch said the ecological impact of the fire within the national park was significant.\n\n\"There are lots of malleefowl mounds in there,\" Ms Gooch said.\n\n\"It's a huge area of habitat that has been destroyed.\n\n\"The 2,000 hectares that has burnt will take many, many years to grow back to the condition where malleefowl can use it again for breeding.\"\n\nA bushfire has burnt 2,000 hectares of the Wyperfeld National Park. (Supplied: Louise Gooch)\n\nShe said fire is a key threat to malleefowl because they rely on leaf litter to incubate the eggs in their large nest mounds.\n\n\"We were really worried that our entire conservation reserve would be burnt, because the fire front was wide and heading straight towards us, fuelled by hot weather and strong winds,\" Ms Gooch said.\n\n\" We felt so relieved when the fire crews brought it under control, only seven hectares of our place was burnt, and luckily none of our malleefowl mounds were impacted. \"\n\nEndangered chick saved from fire\n\nIn the midst of the smoke and ash, conservationists and firefighters found a silver lining.\n\nLoading...\n\nA fire crew scanning the fireground found a tiny, \"well-camouflaged\" malleefowl chick stumbling through the fire's fallout.\n\n\"It was such a stroke of luck that the keen-eyed fire crew noticed ... It's likely the chick hatched that day, because it was still stumbling around and gathering its strength,\" Ms Gooch said.\n\nIt was the first time Mr and Ms Gooch, who run an eco-tourism business and volunteer with the Victorian Mallefowl Recovery Group, had ever seen one of the endangered chicks in real life.\n\n\"We've only ever seen malleefowl chicks on footage from our wildlife cameras, so to see one up close was amazing, we were blown away,\" Ms Gooch said.\n\n\"They're an incredibly cute little bird, and quite chilled out.\"\n\nMs Gooch said there was an 80 per cent mortality rate for chicks in the first 10 days of hatching, so it's extremely rare to see a chick in the wild.\n\n\" We might never see a chick again, this could well be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so we'll treasure this memory forever. \"\n\nRare sighting energises responders\n\nAfter confirming the baby bird was healthy, the couple and firefighters released it on the conservation reserve.\n\n\"We were buzzing with excitement when we released it on our conservation reserve, a safe distance away from the burnt area where dozers and crews would be working,\" Ms Gooch said.\n\nThe malleefowl chick peeks out of a box moments before it was released into the conservation area. (Supplied: Louise Gooch)\n\nMs Gooch said the rescue gave first responders a much-needed lift.\n\n\"They were amazed to see the malleefowl chick up close,\" she said.\n\n\"Their excitement grew when they saw how incredibly excited we were, and once we explained how rare it is to see a chick.\n\n\" I think it was the highlight of their day for sure, and ours too. \"\n\nSupporting wildlife from heat\n\nMs Gooch encouraged people to think about how they can support wildlife throughout the remainder of summer.\n\n\"To help birds and wildlife to survive through the hot summer ahead, the best thing you can do is put fresh water out for them,\" Ms Gooch said.\n\n\"We have a few different containers in our garden. Some are shallow, some are deeper, but they all have rocks or branches so that birds can safely access the water and our pets are kept away from these areas.\"",

    "text": "South Australian farmers will soon be able to use virtual fencing to move livestock out of the path of bushfires after the technology was formally legalised in the state last week.\n\nThe system, which allows livestock to be moved remotely via electronic collars, can guide animals out of danger and prevent them becoming trapped as a fire approaches.\n\nThe state's approval makes it the last jurisdiction in Australia to sign off on the technology, paving the way for rollout next year.\n\nThe announcement has been welcomed by Livestock SA, with the organisation expecting strong demand from primary producers to transition to virtual fencing.\n\nVirtual fencing will help reduce the demand for physical fencing on farms to divide livestock. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"The benefits are multi-dimensional,\" Livestock SA chief executive officer Travis Tobin said.\n\n\"The obvious ones are capital and labour costs that you can reduce \u2026 it enables you to improve the way you manage stock and manage the land.\n\n\"Heaven forbid if they do come, but in natural disasters it gives you that flexibility where you're not losing kilometres of fence lines, and the animals can get away so they're not trapped.\"\n\nNew technology could help in emergencies\n\nSpecific details on how the new technology will be licensed and governed are yet to be released, but businesses are working with the state government to be rollout ready.\n\nHalter is one of the businesses that will apply for a permit to sell and install virtual fencing in the state.\n\nVirtual fencing allows farmers to control where their animals go, using a phone. (Supplied: Halter)\n\nDirector of strategic relations Brent Thomas said the benefits of the technology surpass day-to-day operations.\n\nHe said if a flood or bushfire was to strike, virtual fencing can help protect human as well as animal lives.\n\n\"In traditional farming systems, you've got to staff out \u2026 and it can be quite risky,\" Mr Thomas said.\n\n\"With this technology, farmers are able with the palm of their hand, to move their cattle to safer ground.\n\n'Apple Watch for cows' Virtual fencing was legalised in NSW this week, giving farmers a hands-off option over traditional posts and wire.\n\n\" You can use a collar to move an animal from an unsafe area to a safe area, but you can also remotely disable the collars so they can freely move. \"\n\nMr Thomas said many South Australian farmers were keen for the announcement, having added their names to the company's waitlist months ago.\n\n\"They had been really hopeful this news would come out for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"I think they're very, very excited \u2026 it's going to be a game-changing technology for their farms.\"\n\nSA farmers enthusiastic about transition\n\nOne of the farmers who has been signed up on the wait list for virtual fencing equipment is Adam Mann, co-manager of Donovan's Dairy in the South East.\n\nAdam Mann had been waiting for virtual fencing to be approved in South Australia. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nMr Mann had been advocating for virtual fencing throughout the year, expecting the new technology to save time and money on his farm.\n\n\"It's nice to be on an even playing field with the rest of the states,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll be trying to get it on as soon as possible, early 2026 will be a pretty good goal for us.\"",

    "text": "Australian Open organisers will be grappling with an agonising decision on issuing Nick Kyrgios a wildcard, former Grand Slam finalist and Davis Cup winner Mark Philippoussis says.\n\nPhilippoussis said there were clear-cut pros and cons regarding the Australian drawcard's possible appearance at the Melbourne grand slam.\n\n\"I see the upside as far as the eyes being on him there,\" Philippoussis said.\n\n\"If he can go on and play 100 per cent and loses, that's OK. If he's able to compete \u2026 and feel good and he loses, that's no problem at all.\n\nKyrgios not offered Australian Open wildcard After a career-best year, Queenslander Priscilla Hon was among four Australian Open wildcards named on Monday, but Nick Kyrgios was not among them.\n\n\"But if he goes out there and can't perform but brings in the crowd for a couple of hours, is that enough?\n\n\"It's tough. I see both sides. I see the upside but also the downside as well.\n\n\"You get a wildcard at a tournament and you don't produce because physically you break down, it doesn't look good. It's not good for the tournament, it's certainly not good for the player, so everything is a balancing act.\"\n\nKyrgios, who will play women's world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka in the so-called Battle of the Sexes in Dubai on December 28, has already been awarded a Brisbane International wildcard.\n\nThe 2022 Wimbledon finalist has expressed interest in competing at Melbourne Park.\n\nBut in the 2025 Australian Open, he memorably crashed to a first-round straight sets loss when playing hurt.\n\nKyrgios remains one of the biggest stars in Australian tennis. (Getty Images: Bradley Kanaris)\n\n\"He wouldn't feel good about that,\" Philippoussis said.\n\n\"He couldn't perform and that wasn't much of a show \u2026 not being able to do what you want to do is being in a very tough place.\n\n\"I don't think he is going to want to feel the same way, so I think it's better for him to go: 'I want to play doubles and focus on next year' or build on that.\"\n\nAustralian Open organisers are expected to lock in all wildcards just prior to qualifying starting on January 12, having overlooked Kyrgios when they gave four Australians a call-up to the main draw on Monday.\n\nKyrgios has undergone four rounds of knee and wrist surgery in the past three years.\n\nPhilippoussis said Kyrgios's fitness was obviously key, but so was his mentality.\n\n\"I don't know where his mind is at,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know what he wants to do in his career. Does he want to give it one more go? How serious does he want to take it?\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"I know watching him last year and even a couple of years ago, he couldn't move \u2014 and it doesn't matter how big that serve is if it comes back and you can't move.\"\n\nPhilippoussis said there was also another factor in the Kyrgios wildcard call: if granted, would it rob a young Australian of a potentially career-changing opportunity?\n\n\"If you have got a hungry young Aussie kid who is coming up and give him an opportunity, he could win one or two matches to start off his career and he's on the way,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not easy. I certainly wouldn't want to be a tournament director where you have got to come up with these decisions.\n\n\"I think they can leave it until the last second and just see if he looks good. It's a no-brainer if he looks good and hasn't pulled up sore.\"\n\nAAP",

(Supplied: PCYC NSW)\n\n\"These boys have done a really good job against the odds to be able to put their name forward,\" he said.\n\n\"It really gives the kids something to strive for, not only on the sporting fields and courts, but also out in the community and in their schooling yards.\"\n\n'Getting recognition'\n\nSwan said he appreciates the opportunity to represent his culture through sport.\n\n\" We are actually getting some recognition in our sport. \"\n\nHugo Swan says it is a privilege to represent his Indigenous culture.

(Supplied: Harrow Discovery Centre)\n\nIt was the first recorded sporting team to represent Australia and tour internationally.\n\nAshley will present the Johnny Mullagh Medal \u2014 named in honour of the First Nations' cricket player who has been widely celebrated for his contribution to the game and as captain of the First XI team.\n\nJohnny Mullagh was a Jardwadjali man who played alongside James and Johnny Couzens, both Gunditjmara Keerray Woorroong men from south-west Victoria.\n\nTheir traditional names were changed from Yellenach John Couzens and Grongerong James Mosquito Couzens without their permission to make them more easily identifiable to the English.\n\nJohnny Mullagh's real name was Unarrimin but it was also changed.\n\nThe underdogs\n\nWhile the First XI team holds an important place in cricketing history, Ashley, a proud Erawirung man who now lives in regional Victoria, says their story has largely gone unrecognised.\n\nAshley Couzens now works as a senior lecturer in Indigenous health at Deakin University. (ABC News: Jean Bell)\n\nHe said he hoped his moment at the centre of the MCG would play a role in sharing the story of his ancestors and their teammates.\n\n\"As Australians we love a sporting underdog story ... this is probably one of our original true underdog stories,\" he said.\n\n\"It's certainly gained some traction over the last 10 years.\n\n\"Elder members of our family have been advocating well before that and have tried to bring this amazing story to light.\"\n\nWhile the stories of how the team travelled across the country, and eventually to England, are now legend, Ashley believes the extent of their efforts have still not fully been appreciated.\n\nIn May 1868, the first Australian cricket team arrived in England for a series of matches. The team consisted of 13 Aboriginal stockmen from Victoria\u2019s western districts. (ABC News)\n\n\"They travelled on horse and cart ... played games at Portland across to Warrnambool, then went up to Sydney where they were smuggled on a boat for three months to England,\" he said.\n\n\"I think people often forget when they returned, [Johnny] Couzens and Mullagh actually continued to play for Victoria and the MCC (Melbourne Cricket Club).\n\n\"Then the Aborigines Protection Act came in, which forced them to go back to missions and we all know what that led to.\"\n\nCaptain immortalised through medal\n\nThe Boxing Day medal was renamed in 2020 to the Johnny Mullagh Medal, which was a first-step to officially honouring the First XI Aboriginal cricket team.\n\nAshley had been offered the opportunity to present the medal a year later, but could not make it.\n\nThe 2021 Ashes Boxing Day Test was made famous by Gulidjan man Scott Boland, who on debut took six second innings wickets and was awarded the Johnny Mullagh Medal.\n\nScott Boland capped off an incredible Test debut by winning the Johnny Mullagh medal in 2021. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\nAshley said while he was not there, the moment of Boland's magical bowling spell and the recognition he received was one he would not forget.\n\n\"I actually stopped and shed a tear because I was driving home at the time on the way back from the Riverland [in SA] to Port Fairy,\" he said.\n\n\" I heard the first wicket, the second and the third and suddenly just stopped the vehicle and shed a tear because I know Scotty. \"\n\nScott Boland and Ashley Couzens became friends in 2018, when Boland represented the 2018 Aboriginal XI tour of England, 150 years on from the original team's tour.

(Getty Images: Paul Kane)\n\nAshley said he was encouraged by the increased representation in the Australian Test cricket team and hoped it would inspire the next generation to pick up a bat and ball.\n\n\"Particularly in the rural and regional areas we really need to develop the game,\" he said.\n\n\"For the AFL and other sporting codes, the numbers are dwindling for Aboriginal young people and that's something I know all the codes are trying to address.\"\n\nBoland and Doggett are two of just three First Nations' men to officially represent Australia at Test level.\n\nJason Gillespie stood alone during the late 90s and early 2000s in the game, but post playing has now become a regular voice in ABC Sport's commentary box.\n\nAustralian cricket greats, Darren Lehmann (left) and Jason Gillespie with ABC Radio Adelaide's Leigh Radford (centre) at Adelaide Oval in 2025. (ABC: Kathryn Jensen)\n\nWhile the record books show just three First Nations men have played Test cricket for Australia, Ashley said that does not recognise earlier and unofficial matches between Australia and England.\n\n\"Cricket Australia will put out that Brendan Doggett is the third player of Aboriginal descent to play for Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, that's right because they're only talking about official Test matches.\n\n\" Test matches didn't begin until after the tour of 1868. \"\n\n'The cricket is irrelevant'\n\nCricket Australia's Reconciliation Action Plan lists a commitment to \"increase awareness of cricket\u2019s unique connection with Aboriginal peoples via the 1866 and 1868 First XI teams\".\n\nA Cricket Australia spokesperson said the First XI team were an \"important and inspiring part of cricket history\".\n\n\"Their deeds continue to inform our desire to have more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people playing and enjoying the benefits of our game,\" they said.\n\nThe first Australian sporting team to tour internationally played their first game of cricket in Surrey on May 25, 1868.

    "text": "Dollar Bill knew something strange was happening when the usual pre-Christmas gloom at the club was replaced by old brokers comparing multi-baggers like golf handicaps. One bloke - who hasn\u2019t picked a winner since the mining boom of \u201907 and still confuses EBITDA with a breed of racehorse - claimed he\u2019d backed a \u201cfifty-bagger\u201d before lunch, causing The Dollar\u2019s port to attempt an exit from its heavy crystal glass while leaning over to hear more. But as it turns out, this was the year when even the ghosts of old IPOs came back to life and the small end of the ASX rediscovered the kind of form that makes old men check their screens before their blood pressure.\n\nDollar Bill: The year the ASX remembered how to party.\n\nAfter two years of rates anxiety, liquidity strangulation and a market that couldn\u2019t decide whether to hibernate or panic, 2025 delivered something the small end of the ASX had forgotten how to produce: genuine exuberance backed by actual capital flow. Gold ran like it had an appointment with destiny, rare earths were thrown onto the geopolitical stage like unwilling actors and the metals buried deep in the wiring of the AI revolution suddenly became investment darlings. But the real standout was silver - the unloved sidekick of the precious-metals family which more than doubled this year with spot up about 140 per cent. It wasn\u2019t just joining gold\u2019s parade; it was riding in the lead float, waving regally at the crowd while no one quite knew how to price it.\n\nThe macro backdrop was the kind of circus Dollar Bill secretly enjoys. The US dollar wobbled like a tired heavyweight, central banks finally admitted rate cuts were inevitable and President Trump\u2019s return to office threw tariffs, supply chains and critical minerals into a blender. Markets pretended they wanted calm, but what they really wanted was clarity and 2025 handed them a big, bold marker pen. The world split its commodity allegiances down the middle and the small end of the ASX became the accidental beneficiary.\n\nGold was the anchor. That thing didn\u2019t rally - it detonated. Up about 70 per cent year-to-date and punching through a new high just this week above US$4500 or A$6700 an ounce, it made every geology graduate with a forgotten tenement suddenly look like a genius. Producers\u2019 cash margins exploded, developers recalculated project economics on the fly and explorers who hadn\u2019t seen a meaningful drill result in a decade were dusting off old presentations. Whilst the small caps led the charge, Evolution Mining still surged more than 165 per cent, Newmont soared 150 per cent and Lynas Rare Earths, riding both the gold tide and the geopolitical rare-earths war, finished the year up 95 per cent. It was a reminder that even big companies can still deliver small-company thrills when the commodity winds are howling.",

    "text": "\u201cOur perceptions of time need not reflect time\u2019s actual structure. There is no consensus about time\u2019s nature and the passage of time may not be physically real but only a psychological phenomenon,\u201d says Riggs. Professor Hinze Hogendoorn, head of the Time in Brain and Behaviour Laboratory at the Queensland University of Technology, says unlike senses like smell, sight or taste, for which we have dedicated detectors, there is no organ for perceiving time. Rather, our brains infer it. \u201cThere\u2019s no time particle or wave that can be detected. So technically, we don\u2019t perceive time as such, but we infer paths of time from the fact that things unfold.\u201d The time paradox One puzzling paradox of time is the difference between prospective and retrospective time \u2013 in other words, how our brains infer time in the moment, and time in the past.\n\nLoading Think about the last time you did something really boring \u2013 like a long-haul flight or waiting for a pot of water to boil. In the moment, time tends to drag, but looking back it can feel like it passed in a blip. On the other hand, \u201ctime flies when you\u2019re having fun\u201d, as the saying goes, but a year filled with excitement and novelty can feel slower in the rearview mirror. \u201cThis is something that always breaks people\u2019s heads because there is no objective time for our brains to detect, and we infer time on the fly,\u201d Hogendoorn says. \u201cIf you sit on the floor and stare at the wall or clock for an hour, that\u2019s really hard because you get bored and that makes time crawl. You need distraction to make time pass.\u201d\n\nBut retrospectively, in the absence of significant distractions or moments, our brains tend to collapse months and years together, which can give the illusion of time passing quickly. Why some events pass faster than others With each year that passes, most of us will feel like time accelerates. A common reason given for this is that as we age, each year comprises a smaller fraction of our lives. Hogendoorn says this may be one factor, but a bigger reason is the absence of novelty and significant milestones. \u201cYoung kids are doing things for the first time. They go to school for the first time, they have their first relationship, they have their first job. All those things are exciting,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cBut at some point our days become full of routine and for parents [for example], at the end of the week, they might have nothing particularly new to report and can feel like there\u2019s not enough time in the day, but at the same time, time flies by.\u201d Another influence on our perception of time is our moods and emotional states, says Riggs, which is why time slows down during traumatic or near-death experiences. \u201cThe \u2018passage\u2019 of time does seem to pass more slowly during brief, dangerous events, such as car accidents,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is related to the brain recording such events in greater detail than usual.\u201d How to slow down time Shaking up routine, and taking time to reflect on the year gone by, can help slow down our sense of time. Credit: iStock\n\nThe answer to hitting \u201cpause\u201d on the clock isn\u2019t exactly a satisfying one, Hogendoorn says. \u201cSit down on the floor and stare at the wall if you want to slow down time,\u201d he says. However, some research suggests spending time in nature may help stretch out our minutes and hours. In one experiment, researchers split 161 university students into two groups, and asked each to take a walk of the same length \u2013 one in an urban setting and one in the countryside. Those who walked in the city reported time passing more quickly than those who walked in nature. Another recent study found performing a task in nature, compared with the city, slowed participants\u2019 sense of time.\n\nLoading Clinical psychologist Dr Rebecca Ray says practising mindfulness can help us be more present. \u201cStart by noticing. Bringing attention to small moments helps, like tasting your coffee, taking a breath before the next task, or stepping outside between meetings. You can\u2019t create more time, but you can experience it more fully.\u201d Slowing down time ahead of time, however, is a little easier. Hogendoorn suggests finding ways to shake up routine \u2013 which tends to make time fly by \u2013 and introduce novelty and spontaneity into our lives. This could be something big \u2013 like a holiday, or small \u2013 like changing your route to work. But for neurodivergent people, for whom routine can provide a sense of stability and calm, big changes aren\u2019t always desirable.",

Me, I'm happy here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSisterWorks is a Melbourne-based not-for-profit social enterprise that supports refugee, asylum-seeker or migrant women to achieve economic independence.\n\n\n\n\n\nSisterWorks CEO Ifrin Fittock says for most of these women, the job is a first step into Australia\u2019s workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Women really are the big fabric of the CALD community here in Australia. They are untapped workforce. They're willing to put their best efforts and want to go into employment, want to grow themselves and want to participate economically and be like you and I, the taxpayers of this country. It\u2019s almost their dream to be able to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 80 per cent of Melbourne\u2019s tram seats are now reupholstered by women from migrant, refugee and asylum-seeker backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sisters currently refurbish around 70 seats a month, generating more than 1,500 hours of employment and diverting over 1,200 kgs of waste from landfill over the last financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of our Sisters are crafty. They are really meticulous in their work. And that's precisely the skills that are needed to maintain, re upholster and refurbish the Yarra Trams seats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Little bit hard work but for me, I\u2019m happy because I like sewing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYarra Trams Social Procurement Manager, Francesca MacLean, says this partnership is a small shift that speaks to a bigger idea \u2014 how public institutions can drive change beyond their core services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rail industry has, historically, not been incredibly accessible to women, let alone migrant, refugee and asylum seeker women. So, we really love that we can use our social procurement approach to disrupt that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it\u2019s a way of recognising the skills already present in Melbourne\u2019s multicultural communities, and giving them opportunities to thrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The workforce that SisterWorks has is an incredibly untapped talent pool. They've got the entrepreneurial spirit, the women power. It's our way of demonstrating we can use the taxpayer funds to run the tram network, to deliver value above and beyond dollars. It enables them to be role models within their families and communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's also about self-agency, self-belief and confidence that they are an active participant in this country. They just want to do what you and I do - go to work, save some money, buy a house, buy cars and send the kids to school. And the community will thrive because they have this disposable income that they can spend, that\u2019s how the economy grows.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Melbourne, around three million people use trams every single week.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a seat is damaged, it\u2019s removed and assessed, and the ones needing repair are sent to SisterWorks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If your child spilled some food on the seat because were getting a bit hangry mid-journey, or someone's water bottle or coffee has been built, this is what causes the wear and tear. Our people then determine whether the seat is up to scratch for our passengers. And when it's not, it gets sent off to Sister Works. They change the fabric or sometimes they change the foam as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the Sisters take comfortable seating seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The sisters even test if the foam is comfy enough for Yarra Trams passengers. They literally sit on it. I'm not sure if anyone gets a veto, but we have been told by Ifrin that they do sit on it and have a think, \u2018Would I be happy to sit on this seat if I were catching a tram?\u2019, which is great, right? It shows the care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whenever Melbourne is busy with a lot of events New year, Christmas, school holidays \u2026we tend to get more seats coming to us. It's a livelihood of some of the sisters. And I think the sisters are also very happy to be involved in this project. it's like whenever they're in the tram, they can see that this is actually my work, this is something that I fixed and put back into the tram.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Farah, and the many women working beside her, each stitch is a step toward financial stability and a way to take part in the city they now call home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel very happy! All the time thinking \u2018Oh I made that one, I made that one\u2019.\"\n\n\n\n",

But logging off from work isn't always the same as resting \u2014 so how can we use the holiday break to truly recover?\n\n\n\n\n\nBurnout is a feeling of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion brought on by prolonged stress or excessive demands at work or in your personal life.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch suggests burnout is a worsening issue in Australia. For many, the end of the year can feel particularly exhausting, after months of pushing through stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's this cumulative effect over the year,\" Rachel Hannam, clinical director of North Brisbane Psychologists in Queensland, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We see it in our practice. We get busier from about August through to December, and we think that's because people are getting to the second half of the year and saying, 'I've really got to go and get a little bit of help.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summer holidays themselves can also come with additional stressors for many Australians, including the financial strain of buying gifts and entertaining, potential conflict at family gatherings, the logistics of childcare and high expectations around Christmas celebrations.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO More than a million people won\u2019t discuss Christmas with their children as holiday stress mounts SBS News 05:54 English\n\nIf you've got time off over the holidays, here are some tools for maximising rest and recovery during your break.\n\n\n\nCut back on screen time\n\nResearch has repeatedly suggested that excessive screen time can have a negative impact on our wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many of our day-to-day lives, screens are unavoidable. But if it's possible to spend less time on your devices during your break, Hannam says this would be one of her top tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really a good time to stay off email and stay off social media if you can, more so than normal.\"\n\n\n\nGet outside\n\nSpending time in nature can boost mood and relaxation, encourage movement and help reduce screen time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Get outside,\" Hannam said. \"Even if you're staying home, if you've got time off, find a nice spot and just lie on the grass and look at the sky. Go for a walk, and don't stay indoors if you don't have to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a chance to get outside, get some fresh air and sunshine.\"\n\n\n\n'Curate your time'\n\nWhile the holidays can be a fantastic time to spend quality time with family, this isn't always a positive experience for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Be discerning and assertive about time,\" Hannam says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you know you're going to see family members that can be difficult to engage with, try to set boundaries to \"manage that dosage and curate your time\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThat might mean deciding to spend a few hours with a certain family member rather than a whole day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Find that middle path between connecting with family members, but not overdosing.\"\n\n\n\nGet back in balance\n\n\"Holidays are a great time to get back in balance,\" Hannam says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat could look like catching up on sleep, getting in some physical movement or exercise, resetting eating patterns and practising self-care.\n\n\n\nLet your brain rest\n\nSome of the brain's most important functions happen when it is resting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we're in periods of really intense stress that go on and on, we often don't lay down memories,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes things are a bit of a blur.\"\n\n\n\n\"The neurological basis for that is that the brain has to divert resources.

    "text": "Global travel is entering a new era, with airlines expanding their international networks, new long-haul routes opening up, and extra flights added across Asia and the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you're still hoping to spend some of the summer overseas or dreaming of ditching the winter blues later in the year, there's no shortage of attractive destinations available to Aussie travellers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if it's been a little while since your last international trip, there might be some things you need to be aware of, from new border entry requirements to baggage regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few of the changes that are set to shape how Australians travel in 2026.\n\n\n\nNew flight routes and frequencies\n\nSeveral Australian airlines will already have new flight routes up and running as 2026 arrives, or introduce new ones later in the year.\n\n\n\nVirgin Australia and Jetstar are among the airlines that will launch new international routes in 2026. Source: Getty / Bloomberg By the start of the year, Virgin Australia will have launched daily services from Melbourne to Doha, in partnership with Qatar Airways, complementing Virgin's existing services to the Qatari capital from Brisbane, Sydney, and Perth.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween November 2025 and March 2026, Virgin will also operate seasonal Tasmanian services to support increased travel demand. Those include up to three return services per week between Adelaide and Launceston, Adelaide and Hobart, and Perth and Launceston.\n\n\n\n\n\nJetstar has expanded into the Philippines, launching direct routes from Perth to Manila and Brisbane to Cebu in time for summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting 23 March next year, the airline will also start operating five return flights a week between Melbourne Avalon and Bali (Denpasar), adding more than 120,000 seats a year in and out of the popular destination.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September, Qantas and Jetstar announced an expansion of their trans-Tasman services for 2026, adding nearly 210,000 seats between Australia and New Zealand across four routes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Jetstar, this includes more services between Brisbane and Auckland, Melbourne and Christchurch, and Sydney and Auckland. For Qantas, it means up to two additional flights per week between Sydney and Christchurch in February and March.\n\n\n\n\n\nJetstar will also launch a new direct route between Brisbane and Queenstown from June 2026, operating three times a week during the snow season (June to October).\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore Airlines, meanwhile, will introduce a Premium Economy option for one of its four daily services between Brisbane and Singapore, starting from 1 November 2026.\n\n\n\nEurope goes digital\n\nPlanning a Eurotrip? There are two changes you should be aware of before your getaway in Greece, sojourn in Spain, or visit any of more than two dozen other European destinations.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Entry/Exit System, non-EU travellers to the Schengen area will need to have their fingerprints scanned. Source: Getty / PA Images / Gareth Fuller The first is the Entry/Exit System (EES), a digital identity system that will record the data of non-EU nationals travelling into the Schengen area, a zone of 29 European countries that allows people to travel freely across their mutual borders.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's intended to streamline the border process and increase security, and will replace the need to have your passport stamped.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process will apply when travelling through the external borders of any Schengen area country, but not when travelling within the Schengen area.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour travel document data and other personal details will be electronically registered, including your entry and exit dates, as well as any previous refusals of entry.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will also have your photo taken and fingerprints scanned by passport control officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you refuse to hand over this data, officials can deny your entry to the Schengen area, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Smartraveller website warns.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you overstay your visa, the system will be able to identify and record this.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EES started a gradual rollout on 12 October this year and is expected to be fully implemented by 10 April 2026. As it's a progressive rollout, you may still need to get your passport stamped before then.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The looming Europe travel change that will affect Australians\n\nThe long-delayed European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) is also set to come into effect in the last quarter of 2026, after the full rollout of the EES.\n\n\n\n\n\nETIAS is a mandatory electronic travel authorisation that will be required for nationals from dozens of countries \u2014 including Australia \u2014 before entering any of 30 European countries for stays of up to 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need to complete an online form and give some personal information and travel document details. For those aged 18 to 70, the application submission fee is \u20ac20 ($35), and the issued permit will be valid for three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe specific date the mandatory system will start will be announced next year, and its launch will be followed by transitional and grace periods of up to 12 months.\n\n\n\nVisa-free travel to China continues\n\nChina announced in November that it was extending its visa-free entry scheme for 45 countries, including Australia, until the end of 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy, which was scheduled to expire at the end of this year for many countries, allows eligible international travellers to enter China for up to 30 days without a visa, primarily for tourism purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country has been taking strides in recent years to boost international tourism.\n\n\n\nWhen does the US Global Entry Program start?\n\nEarlier this year, Australian travellers learned they would soon be able to clear border control more quickly at American airports , after new laws passed parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States Global Entry Program allows overseas visitors to pay a fee in exchange for expedited clearance upon arrival in the US, with reduced paperwork and shorter queues. It is set to be expanded to include Australian passengers.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The growing number of Australians adopting this risky travel trend\n\nAn initial phase of around 1,000 Australians took place at the start of the year and has since closed. The second and final phase, with applications open to all eligible Australians, is expected to open later in 2025, but a precise start date has not yet been announced.\n\n\n\nWhat are the rules on portable phone banks?\n\nThis year, many international airlines have cracked down on portable power banks, often used for charging electronic devices like mobile phones. Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Korean Air, Thai Airways and Cathay Pacific are among the operators that have banned the use of power banks while on their flights.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, Virgin Australia and Qantas also announced they were restricting the use of the power banks following several international incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Virgin's policy, passengers will no longer be allowed to use power banks to charge other devices on board. Portable battery packs will also need to be kept within sight and easily accessible throughout the flight, and there will be a limit of two power banks per person.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevices over 100 watt-hours will require airline approval, and power banks exceeding 160 watt-hours will be banned. Qantas and its subsidiary Jetstar will implement similar restrictions.\n\n\n\nThere have been numerous incidents involving portable phone power banks on flights in recent years. Source: Getty / 5./15 WEST / iStockphoto A power bank in an overhead locker is suspected to have caused a fire that broke out on a Virgin Australia flight from Sydney to Hobart in July.\n\n\n\nWhere are you headed?\n\nBack in August, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed jetsetters were switching up some of the locations they were travelling to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bureau's annual report found the top overseas destination in 2024-2025 was Indonesia, accounting for more than 1.74 million (14 per cent) of Australian trips.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was followed by New Zealand, Japan, the US and China.\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan edged out the US to take third place, with the latter dropping to fourth. China moved up two places to secure its spot in the top five.\n\n\n\n",

But they are biting people right across the community as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New South Wales Premier Chris Minns are among the senior leaders to make an appearance at the Bill Crews lunch in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reverend Crews says that most of the people who come to the Ashfield site have dislocated families and lives - and the presence of senior politicians is meaningful.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Sydney associate professor Dr Michelle Lim - who is also the CEO of the group Ending Loneliness Together - says there's a loneliness crisis in Australia that can be exacerbated over the Christmas period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So many Australians also do not have close family and friends around to share this festive season with. And in particular, many people as well who might say that they're single or perhaps that they're living away from their community - or they have family that lives overseas - often talk about how Christmas or holiday periods can be particularly isolating for them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Melbourne rabbi and his young family have been forced to flee their home after an early morning arson attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir silver sedan that had a Happy Hanukah sign on its roof was set alight in St Kilda East.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt had been parked in the driveway of the rabbi's home.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief of the Anti-Defamation Commission Doctor Dvir Abramovich says this latest attack shows antisemitism is out of control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This, of course, comes after the massacre in Bondi of 15 people and unless every single government, state and federal, takes this existential threat to Jews seriously, what we saw in Bondi was just a rehearsal. We may see it in Melbourne. Here we go, another day, another antisemitic attack.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union, France and Germany have condemned visa bans imposed on five Europeans by the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe banned group includes French former EU commissioner Thierry Breton.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreton was the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, and often clashed with tycoons including Elon Musk over their obligations to follow EU rules.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials in Brussels say the EU could \"respond swiftly and decisively\" against what they have described as unjustified measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lawyer representing Jeffrey Epstein victims says Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor needs to talk to US authorities, following the latest release of Epstein files that contained several references to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawyer Gloria Allred says Andrew's silence has been deafening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why would he be unwilling to help them to achieve their goal of truth and transparency? The silence from Andrew is deafening and I really feel it's inexcusable for a former member of royalty.'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice says it has found more than a million more documents potentially tied to the convicted sex offender - which has delayed a full release for weeks while officials redact details to protect victims.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration began releasing files related to criminal investigations of Epstein, the late American financier who was friends with Trump in the 1990s, to comply with a law passed by Congress in November.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Labor senator for South Australia Nick Bolkus has died at the age of 75.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst elected in 1980, he was one of the longest-serving senators and served as a minister in the Hawke and Keating governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe served as minister for immigration and ethnic affairs and is being remembered for his contribution to multiculturalism.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport,\n\n\n\n\n\nLawConnect will be chasing a third consecutive line honours title when the Sydney to Hobart yacht race launches from tomorrow morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nSailors are preparing for rough conditions on the first night with strong southerly winds and large swells forecast.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere'll be 129 boats lining up for this year's event, with six 100 foot supermaxis in the fleet, along with 16 international entrants.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them will be Ron Epstein from San Franscisco, who was forced to pull out of last year's event when a boom broke before he could reach the finish line.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Everything comes to an end, and Christmas food is no exception \u2014 but there are ways to delay this end and prevent food waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equivalent of over 54 million plates is expected to be thrown away this Christmas. At the same time, about 69 per cent of households' food waste is actually edible, according to new research by End Food Waste Australia (EFWA).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contributes to 7.6 million tonnes of food waste in Australia each year, as shown by the National Food Waste Strategy study, costing the country $36.6 billion annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even if you have overestimated the number of guests and their appetites for your festive feast, the good news is that there are ways to save those foods for the rest of your holidays.\n\n\n\nThe vital first two hours\n\nThe first important tip is that you may only have a couple of hours to save the leftovers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo keep all those foods fresh, your fridge or freezer is your best friend, and the general rule of thumb is that if the food is out for less than two hours, you can either use it or store it at less than 5C.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, hot food cannot be refrigerated directly, as it may raise the fridge temperature and put all other stored food at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting hot food into a fridge may raise the fridge temperature above 5C.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the fridge temperature rises above 5C, all other food stored in the fridge is at risk of bacterial growth.\n\n\n\nMake sure you keep them separate from uncooked foods like raw meat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not need all the food in the next few days, you can freeze it, donate it to your local food relief organisation or let the guests serve themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the scenario that the food has been out of the fridge for between two and four hours, there is still hope: you cannot store it, but you can still eat it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for anything over four hours, there is no good news \u2014 the leftovers will become part of millions of tonnes of Australia's food waste.\n\n\n\nHow long can you safely eat the leftovers?\n\nIf you have successfully refrigerated your leftovers within the first two hours, you have saved the food for days.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the NSW Food Authority, generally, leftovers stored in the fridge can be eaten within three days, and cooked rice and pasta should be eaten within two days.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the actual storage time depends on the type of food. Turkey remains fresh for less than four days, while ham on the bone can last up to 10 days and Christmas pudding can be kept in the fridge for two weeks.\n\n\n\nExperts warn that after three to four days, bacteria may start to grow in refrigerated leftovers, increasing the risk of food poisoning. Bacteria usually don't alter the taste, smell, or appearance of food. So, you can't rely on these signs to tell if a food is dangerous to eat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not going to eat the leftovers within three days, the alternative is to freeze them, which will keep them for up to three months.\n\n\n\nHow to reheat the leftovers?\n\nAlways remember to reheat your leftovers, as harmful bacteria can grow even in the fridge.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Department of Health of Victoria, to consume the food safely, \"you need to reheat food in the oven or microwave until it reaches 75C or hotter in the centre ... [and] if reheated food is displayed it must be kept at 60C or hotter.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The simple Christmas food swaps that'll cut your grocery bill\n\n\"Reheat and display food only once and throw it out if not eaten or sold \u2014 this will avoid the food being at temperatures that support the growth of harmful bacteria,\" the department says.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts also warn against reheating rice and pasta more than once, and ensuring they are steaming hot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor frozen leftovers, defrost in the fridge for 24 hours before reheating.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tasmania's wilderness sits Australia's deepest lake: Lake St Clair.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands visit every year but until now, the underwater landscape has remained somewhat of a mystery.\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrographic surveyor Augustin D\u00e9plante, from the CSIRO, recently led a team that mapped the lake bed for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I saw that the deepest lake in Australia had never been surveyed with the multi beam, I was very surprised. But I guess if it was easy to do it would have already been done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team used a multibeam sonar to map the lake bed over nine days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Basically, it's just as if we emptied the lake of its water, and we're walking around and we're mapping it out. So I think it's going to be quite fascinating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir work has revealed an underwater landscape that's never been seen before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can see the input of fresh water basically coming into the lake from the mountains and it's carving through the lake floor so we have these waterfalls basically coming down into the lake and then reaching the cliffs, it's pretty incredible to look at and you can see the trees as well sometimes overhanging these areas, it's quite spectacular.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Croghan has been running a Lodge at the southern end of the lake for almost 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Personally, I would describe the lake as my church. It is the most peaceful place on this planet. I may be biased, but so many other people are saying the same thing. Visually stunning, never the same two days in a row. The most phenomenal place to swim, because it's, as I said, it's the cleanest air and it's the cleanest water in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe keeps a special bottle of gin behind the bar that was lowered to the bottom of the lake a few years ago by a different team of researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust for giggles one night, I said to them, would you take a bottle of gin, put it on the bottom of the lake and take a photograph? And they're like, Yeah, sure. So I'm like, okay, great. So they did.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt didn't go down to the deepest point - but it still surpassed 100 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey did the best they could, but they brought the bottle back, and it just sits behind the bar. It's now been depth tested. I think that was about 120 metres.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAugustin D\u00e9plante says the mapping shows the deepest point of Lake St Clair plunges to about 163 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's about towards the south on the western side, just in the corner, basically, we can almost see the glacier would have really, like, you know, grinded through that corner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCloser to shore, a remotely-operated vessel known as the OTTER completed the mapping.\n\n\n\nIt was piloted by autonomous systems research engineer Dr Hui Sheng Lim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It can go really shallow into regions, like less than less than two metre, even less than a metre, as well. As long as there's no, like, hidden rocks or anything underneath the surface. So those are the areas where the big vessel won't be able to get to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Otter revealed areas close to shore with sharp drop-offs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do, it's like mapping the shallow region so you can actually see how the contour changes on the shoreline. And you'll see how quick that actually dropped from the shoreline, like all the way down to 50 metres, like you can see a metre here, and then next moment you are in a 10 metre zone, and next moment you're already in, like, 30 metre, 50 metres deep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOtter can also operate autonomously, following a precise, pre-planned path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the most useful features is we will be able to autonomously find gaps and find the best way to cover those missing gaps in our data sets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe detailed data collected will be made public, providing an important resource it's hoped will fuel further study of Lake St Clair.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will include what might be found in the depths.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Dollar Bill knew something strange was happening when the usual pre-Christmas gloom at the club was replaced by old brokers comparing multi-baggers like golf handicaps. One bloke - who hasn\u2019t picked a winner since the mining boom of \u201907 and still confuses EBITDA with a breed of racehorse - claimed he\u2019d backed a \u201cfifty-bagger\u201d before lunch, causing The Dollar\u2019s port to attempt an exit from its heavy crystal glass while leaning over to hear more. But as it turns out, this was the year when even the ghosts of old IPOs came back to life and the small end of the ASX rediscovered the kind of form that makes old men check their screens before their blood pressure.\n\nDollar Bill: The year the ASX remembered how to party.\n\nAfter two years of rates anxiety, liquidity strangulation and a market that couldn\u2019t decide whether to hibernate or panic, 2025 delivered something the small end of the ASX had forgotten how to produce: genuine exuberance backed by actual capital flow. Gold ran like it had an appointment with destiny, rare earths were thrown onto the geopolitical stage like unwilling actors and the metals buried deep in the wiring of the AI revolution suddenly became investment darlings. But the real standout was silver - the unloved sidekick of the precious-metals family which more than doubled this year with spot up about 140 per cent. It wasn\u2019t just joining gold\u2019s parade; it was riding in the lead float, waving regally at the crowd while no one quite knew how to price it.\n\nThe macro backdrop was the kind of circus Dollar Bill secretly enjoys. The US dollar wobbled like a tired heavyweight, central banks finally admitted rate cuts were inevitable and President Trump\u2019s return to office threw tariffs, supply chains and critical minerals into a blender. Markets pretended they wanted calm, but what they really wanted was clarity and 2025 handed them a big, bold marker pen. The world split its commodity allegiances down the middle and the small end of the ASX became the accidental beneficiary.\n\nGold was the anchor. That thing didn\u2019t rally - it detonated. Up about 70 per cent year-to-date and punching through a new high just this week above US$4500 or A$6700 an ounce, it made every geology graduate with a forgotten tenement suddenly look like a genius. Producers\u2019 cash margins exploded, developers recalculated project economics on the fly and explorers who hadn\u2019t seen a meaningful drill result in a decade were dusting off old presentations. Whilst the small caps led the charge, Evolution Mining still surged more than 165 per cent, Newmont soared 150 per cent and Lynas Rare Earths, riding both the gold tide and the geopolitical rare-earths war, finished the year up 95 per cent. It was a reminder that even big companies can still deliver small-company thrills when the commodity winds are howling.",

    "text": "\u201cOur perceptions of time need not reflect time\u2019s actual structure. There is no consensus about time\u2019s nature and the passage of time may not be physically real but only a psychological phenomenon,\u201d says Riggs. Professor Hinze Hogendoorn, head of the Time in Brain and Behaviour Laboratory at the Queensland University of Technology, says unlike senses like smell, sight or taste, for which we have dedicated detectors, there is no organ for perceiving time. Rather, our brains infer it. \u201cThere\u2019s no time particle or wave that can be detected. So technically, we don\u2019t perceive time as such, but we infer paths of time from the fact that things unfold.\u201d The time paradox One puzzling paradox of time is the difference between prospective and retrospective time \u2013 in other words, how our brains infer time in the moment, and time in the past.\n\nLoading Think about the last time you did something really boring \u2013 like a long-haul flight or waiting for a pot of water to boil. In the moment, time tends to drag, but looking back it can feel like it passed in a blip. On the other hand, \u201ctime flies when you\u2019re having fun\u201d, as the saying goes, but a year filled with excitement and novelty can feel slower in the rearview mirror. \u201cThis is something that always breaks people\u2019s heads because there is no objective time for our brains to detect, and we infer time on the fly,\u201d Hogendoorn says. \u201cIf you sit on the floor and stare at the wall or clock for an hour, that\u2019s really hard because you get bored and that makes time crawl. You need distraction to make time pass.\u201d\n\nBut retrospectively, in the absence of significant distractions or moments, our brains tend to collapse months and years together, which can give the illusion of time passing quickly. Why some events pass faster than others With each year that passes, most of us will feel like time accelerates. A common reason given for this is that as we age, each year comprises a smaller fraction of our lives. Hogendoorn says this may be one factor, but a bigger reason is the absence of novelty and significant milestones. \u201cYoung kids are doing things for the first time. They go to school for the first time, they have their first relationship, they have their first job. All those things are exciting,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cBut at some point our days become full of routine and for parents [for example], at the end of the week, they might have nothing particularly new to report and can feel like there\u2019s not enough time in the day, but at the same time, time flies by.\u201d Another influence on our perception of time is our moods and emotional states, says Riggs, which is why time slows down during traumatic or near-death experiences. \u201cThe \u2018passage\u2019 of time does seem to pass more slowly during brief, dangerous events, such as car accidents,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is related to the brain recording such events in greater detail than usual.\u201d How to slow down time Shaking up routine, and taking time to reflect on the year gone by, can help slow down our sense of time. Credit: iStock\n\nThe answer to hitting \u201cpause\u201d on the clock isn\u2019t exactly a satisfying one, Hogendoorn says. \u201cSit down on the floor and stare at the wall if you want to slow down time,\u201d he says. However, some research suggests spending time in nature may help stretch out our minutes and hours. In one experiment, researchers split 161 university students into two groups, and asked each to take a walk of the same length \u2013 one in an urban setting and one in the countryside. Those who walked in the city reported time passing more quickly than those who walked in nature. Another recent study found performing a task in nature, compared with the city, slowed participants\u2019 sense of time.\n\nLoading Clinical psychologist Dr Rebecca Ray says practising mindfulness can help us be more present. \u201cStart by noticing. Bringing attention to small moments helps, like tasting your coffee, taking a breath before the next task, or stepping outside between meetings. You can\u2019t create more time, but you can experience it more fully.\u201d Slowing down time ahead of time, however, is a little easier. Hogendoorn suggests finding ways to shake up routine \u2013 which tends to make time fly by \u2013 and introduce novelty and spontaneity into our lives. This could be something big \u2013 like a holiday, or small \u2013 like changing your route to work. But for neurodivergent people, for whom routine can provide a sense of stability and calm, big changes aren\u2019t always desirable.",
