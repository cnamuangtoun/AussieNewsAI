    "text": "Exclusive: \ufeff An Australian media boss who made the game-changing decision to permanently adopt a four-day week said job applications have skyrocketed since the news went public.\n\nDaniel Willis, founder and chief executive officer of media agency Claxon, allows his workers to take every single Friday off without lower salaries or reduced hours after a successful trial in late 2024.\n\nHe told 9news.com.au it has not only astronomically boosted interest in open roles but his employees are happier and just as productive \u2013 if not more.\n\nDaniel Willis, founder of media agency Claxon, and his team. (Supplied)\n\n\"When I get to the interview stage with candidates, one of the questions I ask them is, why Claxon, why did they apply for the role?\" Willis said in an update six months on.\n\n\"And always amongst their reasons is the four-day work week. So it's been great to help us attract new talent.\"\n\nWillis said he could only permanently introduce a Monday to Thursday week if he kept the hours the same.\n\nStaff at the independent growth agency, which has offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, now condense their 38-hour work week across four days.\n\n\"Everybody does slightly longer days, but ultimately, because we're already a high-productivity business, it actually increases productivity,\" Willis explained.\n\n\"It allows us to keep that same amount of serviceable hours for clients, but with giving that additional day off for the team members.\"\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nPeople are very adaptable to new environments, Willis said.\n\nHe observed his staff become accustomed to three-day weekends quite quickly.\n\nAnd as for himself? Willis said he now couldn't imagine only having 48 hours of rest.\n\n\"It very quickly becomes a new norm and it can become hard to compare it to what they were like coming back after two days,\" he said.\n\nStudies have shown workers are happier and more productive when working four days a week. (Dion Georgopoulos)\n\n\"But I do know that everybody still loves it.\n\n\"I've never had a single staff member since we implemented the trial to ask to go back to five days. It wouldn't be a hard no, but not a single person has even murmured it or whispered it.\"\n\nAn anonymous survey during the trial period revealed some of the \"truly personal\" impacts of more time off on his employees and their families, Willis said.\n\nThe push for a nationwide four-day work week has once again gathered momentum after an international study found it made workers \"healthier, happier, more productive\".\n\nThe paper, published in Nature Human Behaviour, looked at the results of six-month trials of the shortened work week in 141 organisations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK, Ireland, and the US.\ufeff\n\nAn unsurprised Willis said there has been a positive outcome in every study he's seen in reducing the work week.\n\nWillis trialled a four-day week in January and permanently adopted it soon after. (Supplied)\n\n\"I haven't read one that says giving employees a four-day week makes them unhappier, makes them work less or have lower sort of productivity,\" he said.\n\n\"So that sounds exactly in line with what we've experienced at Clarkson.\"\n\nAfter Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said a four-day week was \"not on our agenda\" as federal parliament returns, Willis admitted he knows why there's still a lot of resistance to this new-age model.\n\n\"I think there's still a lot of fear around it and I also believe that it's only really suitable for very structured businesses,\" Willis said.\n\n\"Trying to move a business that was fast and loose to four days might be a bit chaotic.\n\n\"But for businesses that have a strong operating rhythm and are able to effectively manage and measure the change and the impact on staff and clients, I think they've got nothing to be fearful of.\"\n\nWillis said he expects to see more and more businesses to test out four-day weeks because you \"can't put the genie back in the bottle\".",

    "text": "Nowadays, it is not enough for superheroes to merely save the world \u2014 they must also shoulder the responsibility of reviving a moribund, multi-billion-dollar genre.\n\nFor those of us still counting, Fantastic Four: First Steps is the 37th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the beginning of its sixth \"phase\", though no one seems to know what these arbitrary groupings mean anymore.\n\nFast facts about The Fantastic Four: First Steps What: A team of brilliant super-powered scientists must save the world from a planet-eating threat Starring: Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach Directed by: Matt Shakman Where: In cinemas now Likely to make you feel: Not particularly optimistic\n\nWhat is clear is that, like this month's reintroduction of Superman, Fantastic Four is keen to wipe the slate clean for a broader mega-franchise that has become encumbered by behind-the-scenes catastrophes and dwindling box-office returns.\n\nTo that extent, both films hark back to old-school heroics with a gleaming earnestness and forgo overplayed origin stories to drop audiences into their heroes' early careers as they face their first major setback.\n\nFirst Steps goes the extra mile by jumping over to a utopia-type dimension running parallel to the ongoing MCU continuity, and winding back the clock to the 1960s.\n\nIt is a world that beckons to be explored, and the film's greatest triumph (courtesy of production designer Kasra Farahani): a space-age fantasia of monorails, tube TVs and flying cars sculpted with soft curves and bursting with playful colours.\n\nKirby's character, Sue Storm, is a diplomat. \"She seems to equalise the team a lot. But also coming up against different nemeses, she can be so fierce,\" Kirby told Marvel.com. (Supplied: Disney)\n\nHere, the Fantastic Four are not just the only superheroes who exist \u2014 they are a team of brilliant astronauts who have become the world's primary governing body in the four years since an errant interstellar expedition exposed them to performance-enhancing cosmic rays.\n\nThat freak encounter stretched intractable alpha genius Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal, The Last of Us) into a plasticine shape-shifter; his wife, Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby, Mission: Impossible), was endowed with invisibility and force field projection; her brazen younger brother Johnny (Joseph Quinn, Stranger Things) became, well, a Human Torch; and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach, The Bear) got the short end of the stick by irreversibly transforming into a sentient rock pile with a soft heart.\n\n\"[Moss-Bachrach is] the softest, loveliest human, but with that slightly gruff exterior, a New Yorker through and through \u2014 he is Ben Grimm,\" Shakman told Variety. (Supplied: Disney)\n\nIn the film's opening scene, a flashing pregnancy test announces the newest member of the team: a super-powered son who has begun to gestate in Sue's womb.\n\nFor Reed, already the de facto dad of the team, that joy rapidly dissolves into a deep anxiety over protecting a child in a world where underground mole people, city-levelling kaiju and red apes cause everyday havoc.\n\nHe is the kind of man who can crack the code to faster-than-light travel on a blackboard, but would rather offload the emotional strain of crib-building to H.E.R.B.I.E., their accommodating droid assistant.\n\nPedro Pascal is now Marvel's Daddy Photo shows A smiling Pedro Pascal takes a selfie with fans at a launch event for The Fantastic Four: First Steps. The latest Marvel offering is another blockbuster but the off-screen chemistry of its cast reveals how they found the family at the movie's heart.\n\nDad duties are temporarily put on hold when Julia Garner's (Inventing Anna) naked, chrome-dipped alien, the Silver Surfer (aka Shalla-Bal), rides into town on a wave of impending annihilation. Her planet-devouring master, Galactus (Ralph Ineson, The Witch), has chosen Earth as his next meal and is already on his way.\n\n\"Use this time to rejoice and celebrate, for your time is short,\" she helpfully advises.\n\nThe Fantastic Four venture into space to face this cosmic behemoth, only to discover that the apocalypse can indeed be averted \u2014 but at the cost of Sue's child.\n\nIf I were being uncharitable, I would suggest that there was something vaguely regressive about a superhero film that was concerned with protecting the sanctity of the nuclear family, even if it put the whole world at risk.\n\nLater, it is revealed that Richards has installed a surveillance network across New York to neutralise local crime organisations, a way to \"babyproof the world\". It is a cute line that is unavoidably at odds with earlier superhero films like The Dark Knight and Avengers: Age of Ultron, which rightfully pointed out the kind of worrying implications embedded in this form of vigilantism.\n\nGarner plays Silver Surfer, a herald of the space god Galactus. \"She has this mysterious energy about her,\" Garner told Entertainment Weekly. (Supplied: Disney)\n\nLike Superman, First Steps's rejection of the cynical, often deconstructionist tendencies of the 2010s's superhero results in an overt hostility towards our own reality. We are asked to relate to adult concerns about parenthood and relationships, but to ignore any awkward real-world parallels that can be inferred.\n\nIt is the fundamental problem with turning serials and chintzy Saturday morning cartoons into megabudget events that rely on an adult fanbase: we can only take these films so seriously before the illusion of uncomplicated fun is ruined.\n\nFor all its strides towards humanism, our four heroes find themselves left in the dust as the film zips through its disaster movie plot, often letting weeks fly by in hurried montages.\n\nPascal (pictured with Joseph Quinn) told ABC Entertainment that The Fantastic Four: First Steps cast was like \"family\". (Supplied: Disney)\n\nKirby is the only character who gets to actually emote, if only as a protective mother; the script only skirts by the edges of these characters, with the prickly edges of Pascal's over-protective, galaxy-brained dad feeling smoothed over. (If Pascal really has the makings of a traditional movie star, we are yet to see a film that proves it.)\n\nIf only this film were enjoyable enough to warrant turning your brain off. Nice as it is to admire the interior design of a Marvel movie, director Matt Shakman (WandaVision) has few compelling ideas on how to shoot its physical sets and CGI extravaganzas.\n\nSave for a glimpse into Sue's unborn child, the team's powers are deployed without imagination and are subject to ropey digital effects. The arrival of Galactus in the film's finale plays out like a kaiju movie in slow-motion.\n\nAustin returns for season 2 Photo shows Characters of Austin in a pop-up book with a purple background with title Austin below in white. Tune in this Sunday at 7.30pm on ABC TV or on ABC iview.\n\nThe 60s sensibility is also ruined with thoroughly modern dialogue, riddled with the barrage of unfunny, off-brand Whedon banter that has become an unfortunate trademark of these films. Giacchino's whimsical score can only carry the tone so far, though even then, it's nowhere near the kind of jazzy, retrofuturist perfection of his work on The Incredibles (which, for the record, is still the best Fantastic Four film in existence).\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe will, one day, come to an end \u2014 not because there is a shortage of worthy ideas accessible from its source material, but because Disney's production-line approach to filmmaking gorges on comic book lore while spitting out idiosyncrasies.\n\nFantastic Four: First Steps defies expectations of what a Marvel film can look and feel like \u2014 and in doing so, it proves just how little is really allowed to change.",

    "text": "The Australian music-loving public was put to the ultimate test in recent weeks when the teams at triple j and Double J asked us to vote in the Hottest 100 of Australian Songs.\n\nIn typical Hottest 100 fashion, people were given the chance to vote for their 10 favourite songs, this time from the history of Australian music.\n\nGetting that list down to 10 is a tough task when you only have a year's worth of music to choose from. When voting for songs from the entire history of Australian music, it felt impossible.\n\nThis Saturday, we learn which locally made songs Australians love the most.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the countdown. Make sure to join us here on the ABC News site as we take you through every moment in our live blog from 9:30am AEST.\n\nWhat time does the Hottest 100 start?\n\nThings kick off a little earlier than usual for this Hottest 100: coverage starts at 10am Australian Eastern Standard Time, and you'll hear number 100 play out not long after that.\n\nOf course, not everyone lives in the same time zone, so here's what time to tune in around the country.\n\nACT: 10am\n\nNew South Wales: 10am\n\nNorthern Territory: 9:30am\n\nQueensland: 10am\n\nSouth Australia: 9:30am\n\nTasmania: 10am\n\nWestern Australia: 8am\n\nIf you're overseas, click here to find out what time it starts in your part of the world.\n\nWhen does the Hottest 100 finish?\n\nNow there's one question we can't answer, because we don't know how long the songs will be or how much our esteemed announcers will rave about the tunes played.\n\nPut it this way: if you count each song as being roughly 4 minutes long and make some time for the announcers to talk about the songs, interview some artists and chat with music lovers around the country enjoying the countdown, you quickly get to around 10 hours.\n\nSo, we reckon you'd be safe to assume the number one song will land somewhere around the 8pm mark. Don't hold us to that. Stay tuned early!\n\nHow to listen to the Hottest 100?\n\nThis countdown will be streamed right across the triple j network, meaning you can tune in on triple j, Double J, triple j Unearthed or triple j Hottest.\n\nIf you need the radio frequency for triple j in your area, you can find it right here.\n\nOtherwise, you can listen online, on the ABC listen app, the triple j app, on your TV, or you could always crash a party and listen to it there.\n\nThere are Hottest 100 parties?\n\nOf course. And while there's nothing stopping you pulling out the cheese and kabana and throwing your own, there is a stack of venues around the country willing to do the dirty work for you.\n\nYou can find a comprehensive list of Hottest 100 parties happening around the country right here.\n\nHere's where Hottest 100 listening parties are happening near you! Photo shows A room full of people partying and celebrating with their hands above their heads Gearing up for the Hottest 100 of Australian Songs and looking for somewhere to tune in on the day?\n\nWhich announcers are broadcasting the Hottest 100?\n\nAn esteemed bunch of announcers from across the triple j and Double J families will take you through the countdown on Saturday.\n\nHere's a rundown on who you can hear and when.\n\n100\u201381: Ash McGregor and Dave Woodhead\n\n80\u201361: Dylan Lewis and Yumi Stynes\n\n60\u201341: Abby Butler and Tyrone Pynor\n\n40\u201321: Concetta Caristo and Luka Muller\n\n20\u20131: Zan Rowe and Lucy Smith\n\nHow can I vote in the Hottest 100?\n\nSorry to say, you're already too late. Voting closed last week and the teams at triple j and Double J have been busy crunching numbers ever since.\n\nIt's not too early to start thinking about how you might vote in the Hottest 100 for this year, though. Keep a running list of your favourite songs of the year and keep your ears on triple j (or eyes on their socials) to find out when voting opens.\n\nHow many people voted in the Hottest 100?\n\nHeaps!\n\nHundreds of thousands of people voted (as you probably noticed on social media over the past few weeks) and the final tally of votes is a whopping 2,655,826.\n\nThat means whoever makes it into this Hottest 100 has commanded a serious number of votes, no matter where they place.\n\nWho is predicted to win the Hottest 100?\n\nNo idea! But if you want to get a sense for some songs that might make it into the countdown, a bunch of Australian artists and entertainers have revealed their top 10s as part of the Hottest Seat program.\n\nIf Prime Minister Anthony Albanese gets his way, the winner will be one of these.\n\nHow do we find out who came 200\u2013101?\n\nWhile triple j usually plays out the 200\u2013101 songs in the annual Hottest 100 the day after the countdown, that's not happening for this one.\n\nNo information has been released about how we can see the list of songs that just missed out on the countdown at this point. If there are plans afoot, we expect you'll hear about them on the broadcast or on the triple j socials after the countdown.\n\nThe Hottest 100 of Australian Songs happens from 10am AEST on Saturday 26 July.",

    "text": "Faced with years of repaying a student loan under rapidly rising indexation, University of Melbourne graduate Jonas Darmos decided to pay his off fast.\n\nHe used his personal savings and a loan from his parents, which he has now repaid, to clear his HECS-HELP debt of around $35,000 just six months after graduating in 2022.\n\nThe federal government's new legislation, introduced to parliament on Wednesday, aims to reduce student loans by 20 per cent of their value as of June 1, 2025, and would have saved Mr Darmos thousands of dollars.\n\nJonas Darmos paid off his student debt in full shortly after graduation.

(ABC News: Nick Haggarty)\n\nMr Darmos said his peers also welcomed the flexibility that would come with the student loan repayment income threshold being increased from $54,435 to $67,000.\n\n\"I think having the flexibility, especially as a young person, to decide how and when you allocate your money into something is quite important,\" he said.\n\n\"If you are earning a little bit but forced to take a portion of that away and then immediately pay off HECS, I think that can be quite limiting.\"\n\nVoluntary repayments drop\n\nThe director of Albury's Modern You Financial Planners, Daniel Jackson, said around 60 per cent of his clients under 45 had a student debt, which is a unique debt compared to other debts.\n\nDaniel Jackson says student loan repayment plans depend on individual circumstances. (Supplied: Daniel Jackson)\n\nHe said whether people would benefit from prioritising paying off their newly reduced debts would vary from person to person.\n\n\"Ultimately, it is going to come down to every person's circumstance, so with the 20 per cent discount \u2026 it is naturally going to reduce the cost of living or extra expense for them.\"\n\nThe rise and fall and rise of a university graduate's HECS debt.

(ABC News: Lucy Cooper)\n\nMr Jackson said the financial breathing space offered by the student loan reduction could allow some people to focus on other priorities, such as paying off credit cards or saving for a home, or voluntarily reducing their student debt.\n\n\"If they're in a position where the only debt they've got is their HECS debt, then if they start paying that off a lot sooner, it will be just one less liability down the track,\" he said.\n\nMr Jackson said he expected the increased repayment income threshold would also provide a benefit to many students.\n\n\"That little bit of a threshold does make a difference, especially with the cost of living that's going on these days,\" he said.\n\n\"That 1, 2 per cent that's getting taken from their wage could be better used to help them have a more comfortable lifestyle or achieve their goals.\"",

(Reuters: Royal Navy/Benjamin Lyon/LPhot Daniel Bladen)\n\nOther US government sources have also speculated that the administration might make fresh demands of Australia in order to lock in continuing support from the US.\n\nOne UK government official told the ABC that both governments were sending a \"clear and obvious\" signal to the Trump administration that they were not wavering on AUKUS and their support for it remained \"rock-solid.\"\n\nThe federal government has already committed more than $4 billion to bolster submarine production in the United Kingdom, which will work with Australia to co-design the next-generation AUKUS submarine and deliver Australia the small-scale nuclear reactors that will power them.\n\nThe government has already publicly flagged it will need to plough at least $360 billion into developing and sustaining nuclear-powered submarines over the decades, but the ABC has been told Australia has not made any additional direct funding commitments to the UK submarine industrial base under this new treaty.\n\nWhile the United Kingdom's political commitment to AUKUS has remained firm, the British shipbuilding industry has also been beset with serious cost blowouts and delays.\n\nAfter their meetings in Sydney and Geelong, the four ministers will travel to Darwin and visit the UK aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, which is participating in the massive Talisman Sabre military exercises, which will draw in more than 30,000 military personnel from almost two dozen countries.\n\nIt is the first time in more than two decades that a UK aircraft carrier has visited Australia, and the British government says it is a clear signal of its resolve to remain a force in the Indo-Pacific, despite the pressures it is facing due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",

    "text": "Billions of dollars in incentives to get Australian businesses to invest in innovation have not shifted a low level of research and development (R&D).\n\nHaving tried a carrot, one of the nation's top scientific bodies wants to try the stick: whacking big business with a levy if they don't invest a minimum amount in R&D.\n\n\"Research and development underinvestment by both government and business had been long-term and is now intolerable,\" said Anna-Maria Arabia, chief executive at the Australian Academy of Science.\n\nAustralian Academy of Science chief executive Anna-Maria Arabia says \"our back is up against a wall now\".\n\n\" It's time to call time, and rectify declining investment in business research and development. It's time our economy and industry become more innovative. \"\n\nAs the government searches for ideas to boost the nation's flagging productivity and economic growth, the Australian Academy of Science is calling for a rebatable levy on businesses with annual revenue of more than $100 million.\n\nThe idea is to force them to spend up on R&D \u2014 say 0.25 per cent or 0.5 per cent of their revenue \u2014 or cop a levy equal to that, with the money invested by the government in innovation.\n\nClock ticking as Australia's spend falls\n\nThe academy is arguing that a massive boost in research and development is needed to boost productivity.\n\n\"It's not just me saying it, it's the Treasury, it's the Productivity Commission,\" said Ms Arabia, who blasted the complacency of Australian businesses.\n\nAnd it is not just them either.\n\nThe Lowy Institute's Jenny Gordon was chief economist at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and supports the push to fund R&D more effectively.\n\n\"I don't know whether I'd call it a stick, I mean, you could also call it an incentive scheme,\" she said.\n\n\"This is an alternative way to say, 'Well, we need to raise funding, reliable funding for R&D'. So that is not at the whim of government and whatever the budget decides to allocate.\n\n\" So there's a long-term, reliable source of funding. \"\n\nAustralia 'lagging' on R&D spend\n\nAustralia spends vastly less than similar nations on R&D.\n\nHow much do we spend on research and development, as a proportion of what we make? Not much. (Supplied: Australian Academy of Science)\n\nIn 2023, the Productivity Commission wrote that Australian businesses were not \"keeping pace\" with innovation.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, the Harvard Growth Lab Atlas of Economic Complexity ranked Australia 93rd in terms of the complexity of its economy. At the time, that was lagging Kazakhstan, Uganda and Senegal, and only just ahead of Pakistan and Mali.\n\nThe academy, an organisation representing Australia's top research scientists, argues sustained underinvestment by the business sector means there is now a gap of $32.5 billion when compared with the OCED average (we spend 0.89 per cent of GDP, less than half the OECD average of 1.99 per cent).\n\nIt is proposing the levy to push business to go harder on innovation: to secure the future of Australian business.\n\n\"Our back is up against a wall now,\" Ms Arabia said.\n\n\" We live in a volatile world, a technologically advanced world. We need to bring to bear all of the development we can. It's no longer an option, that comfort we've had for decades is not a forever situation. \"\n\n'Hollowed out' system of boosting innovation\n\nProfessor Roy Green knows about the benefits of innovation, as a special innovation advisor at the University of Technology Sydney and on the board of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).\n\nHe believes Australian business has been coasting on the research done by tertiary institutions and government.\n\nUTS professor Roy Green is on the board of the CSIRO and is the chair of the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Hub.\n\n\" I would go even further, because government has not taken a sufficient interest in the role of research and innovation in our productivity performance. \"\n\nWhat that means now, he says, is that we \"have very poor productivity performance that the government is now trying to address \u2026 largely because of our failing research and development support system\".\n\nThe amount spent on R&D has fallen in all sectors: universities, public institutions and private businesses.\n\nOver the past decade, investment in research and development has fallen. (Supplied: Australian Academy of Science)\n\n\"Public R&D barely makes a dent,\" Professor Green said.\n\n\"And that's combined with a massive fall in business expenditure in R&D. The only institutions that are holding it up are universities, and that's only because of increased funding from overseas students \u2014 which we've just cut.\"\n\nLevies to push business to take up beneficial activities \u2014 such as the training guarantee in the 1990s \u2014 show it can be done, he added.\n\nBusiness lobby wants grants and rebates to boost innovation push\n\nThe government's looming Economic Reform Roundtable will bring together business groups, unions, community sector representatives and experts in Canberra next month.\n\nAhead of the event, groups like the academy are making suggestions for changes they would like to see, and submissions on what they see as key issues.\n\nThe submission from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) was released before the suggestion by the academy to put a levy on business, and so does not include a response to it.\n\nWhat it does do is note how much we lag other nations and make suggestions for how to fix that.\n\n\"This underperformance is closely tied to broader issues in the business environment, including weak private investment and an outdated tax and regulatory framework that discourages innovation,\" the ACCI submission noted.\n\nACCI wants to see a long-term policy commitment and a clear strategy from Commonwealth and state governments.\n\nAmong its recommendations are \"refundable tax credits, direct grants, and concessional financing options\" for small to medium-sized businesses and \"stage-specific, low-interest government loans to support business R&D investment\".\n\nEarlier this year, another business lobby group, the Australian Industry Group (Ai Group), welcomed a government discussion paper on R&D.\n\n\"We must fundamentally re-imagine Australia's R&D strategy as a dynamic, responsive system that recognises industry isn't just a vehicle for commercialising R&D developed elsewhere,\" Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said at the time.\n\n\"To put it simply, the current system is not working in Australia's interests.\"\n\nThe group reiterated what the paper suggested, that R&D-intensive businesses demonstrate stronger jobs growth and resilience in uncertain times.\n\n\"R&D investment is not merely an academic exercise but a crucial driver of national prosperity,\" Mr Willox said, calling for a radical push to boost the field.\n\n\"Everything must be on the table. There can be no sacred cows.\n\n\"Simply calling for R&D spending to reach 3 per cent of GDP [gross domestic product] isn't enough. As a start, we must address fundamental issues around commercialising public sector research and how to strengthen industry-research collaboration.\"\n\nAs the roundtable approaches and more big ideas are thrown out, the future structure of R&D could be undergoing development of its own.",

(ABC News: Brendan Esposito)\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud questioned the timing of the decision, saying it looked as though it was a trade to appease US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe biosecurity restrictions on beef imports from the United States were one of the key grievances that led the Trump administration to impose tariffs on Australia.\n\nRed Meat Advisory Council chair John McKillop said while the decision may have been pushed through \"slightly quicker\" than expected, he was confident it was the result of a long-running assessment.\n\n\"Probably the timing isn't a great look, but these changes have been in the pipeline for many years,\" he said.\n\nAre there still biosecurity risks?\n\nGlobal AgriTrends analyst Simon Quilty said the risk of US beef imports introducing diseases to Australia was now much lower.\n\n\"They have improved their traceability methods within America and I think, in all honesty, that the degree of risk is significantly low,\" he said.\n\nSimon Quilty hopes the decision will keep US-imposed tariffs steady. (ABC Wodonga: Ashlee Charlton)\n\nMr McKillop said any risk would also be mitigated by the limited amount of beef Australia was likely to import from the US.\n\n\"They have the lowest beef herd in 70 years in the US at the moment [due to drought],\" he said.\n\n\"The most [beef] that was ever brought in, and this was pre-BSE \u2026 was 210 tonnes \u2026 in contrast to the 395,000 tonnes we exported to the US last year.\"\n\nMr McKillop said the US was also experiencing near-record beef and cattle prices, and it was unlikely Australians would want to pay high prices for their product.\n\nWill Australians buy US beef?\n\nWhile the amount of beef coming into Australia from the US may be limited, Mr Jackson said there could be a market for it.\n\n\"There may be some lines [of product] come into Australia, people who want to sell American beef on a restaurant menu or something like that,\" he said.\n\nAngus beef is considered a premium product aroudn the globe.

Well, probably we're not that happy, but the reality is that if you trade, you've got to be happy to take other people's product as well.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for US-imposed tariffs?\n\nThe trade restriction on US beef has been a key grievance for the Trump administration, which placed a 10 per cent tariff on all Australian imports earlier this year.\n\nProfessor Ben Lyons, from the University of Southern Queensland's Rural Economies Centre of Excellence, said it was difficult to know how the move would impact that tariff.\n\n\"Nothing would surprise us at the moment because that's the new paradigm under the Trump administration \u2014 full of surprises,\" he said.\n\nBen Lyons says US-imposed tariffs have so far had little impact on Australia's beef exports. (ABC News: Victoria Pengilley)\n\nDr Lyons said he was confident the Australian beef industry would maintain a strong export market, regardless of US-imposed tariffs.\n\n\"If past performance is the best indicator of the future, we always seem to find a way with our export markets,\" he said.\n\n\"Even the announcement of this tariff on Australian beef at the beginning of the year hasn't really had any economic impact as yet on our exports.\n\n\"I think we should just carry on calmly and do what we do best.\n\nI don't really see this as being a long-term issue for Australian agriculture.\"",

(ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\nHe said his father wanted farmers to get a fair price for their goods.\n\n\"He knew a lot of the farmers, and a lot of the farmers were getting ripped off by wholesalers, so he said to them, 'Why don't you come to the market?'\n\n\" He just saw an opportunity where the farmers and the public of Cairns could have a win-win situation. \"\n\nLocal farmers sell their produce directly to the public at the markets. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nRusty's vision has grown into a tourism drawcard.\n\n\"People have come to Cairns and know of Rusty's Markets,\" Mr Rees said.\n\n\"Then they go back to their country and tell their friends, 'If you go to Cairns, you've got to go to the market.'\"\n\nAlthough his father died 25 years ago, Mr Rees said his legacy had lived on through the markets.\n\nA variety of produce and other goods are sold at Rusty's Markets. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nDecades of stallholders\n\nThe markets are the primary source of income for farmer Ricky Lee, who has sold fresh produce from his Innisfail farm for three decades.\n\nHe started with a 2-square-metre table, selling mostly bananas.\n\nRicky Lee has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables at the markets for about 30 years. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\n\"We've got four cubicles now,\" Mr Lee said.\n\n\"We try to get as much as we can from our farm and then from the local growers around the place.\"\n\nHeidi Piccolo's family flower stall, Basilisk Blooms, has also operated from the markets for about 30 years.\n\nHeidi Piccolo says her flowers are sold around the world thanks to their exposure at Rusty's Markets. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\n\"People from all over the world come to Cairns, not just to go out to the reef, but to \u2026 see Rusty's Markets and [it's] put us on the world stage,\" she said.\n\n\"These [flowers] go all around the world, they go all around Australia.\"",

    "text": "From the deep hues of Ningaloo Reef to leafy Margaret River wine country, glossy murals spruiking Western Australia's regional offerings line the walls of Perth Airport.\n\nBut the high-visibility garb dominating its queues suggests many travellers are bound for another destination, and for reasons far less idyllic.\n\nMine workers crowd flights to Karratha but that could be set to change. (ABC News: Cody Fenner)\n\nCommunities in the Pilbara have long sought to dispel the perception the region is just a \"big mine site\".\n\nIn light of Australia's 21st World Heritage listing this month, some are hoping the Murujuga Cultural Landscape, more than 1,500 kilometres north of Perth, will put the red-dirt capital on the map.\n\nBookings boom\n\nJeff Gillies, chief commercial officer at cruise line Coral Expeditions, said the international recognition of Murujuga had \"absolutely\" increased bookings.\n\n\"The World Heritage listing will increase the awareness,\" Mr Gillies said.\n\n\" I'd imagine other lines will look to travel there, and we'll look to do more and maybe they'll stay a little bit longer. \"\n\nCoral Expeditions is one of the few cruise companies in Australia with an itinerary that features the Burrup Peninsula, or Murujuga, off Karratha.\n\nThe exploratory-style line has travelled there since 2019, with passengers tendered ashore for tours with Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation (MAC) rangers.\n\n\"[Travellers] definitely seek out World Heritage areas because they know they know that they're going to see a special place on Earth.\"\n\nJeff Gillies says touring Murujuga's rock art is an \"emotional\" stop for cruise passengers. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)\n\nThe nearby Port of Dampier is home to one of the country's busiest industrial ports but only welcomed its first cruise vessel in 2023.\n\nMr Gillies said the lack of a dedicated cruise terminal, leaving vessels to dock within the cargo wharf, could be a barrier for less nimble craft.\n\nThe World Heritage area consists of the Burrup Peninsula and the islands of the Dampier Archipelago. (ABC Pilbara: Alistair Bates)\n\nMAC, which jointly manages the World Heritage site, told the ABC it had recently struck a deal with French operator Ponant Cruises to also visit Murujuga.\n\nThe arrangement would bring larger contingents of guests to view the area's ancient Aboriginal rock art.\n\nGrand designs\n\nThe World Heritage listing significantly increases the conservation estate once covered by the Murujuga National Park from 5,134 hectares to just under 100,000.\n\nMAC deputy chair Belinda Churnside said commercial opportunities had to be balanced with cultural obligations.\n\n\"We have roles and responsibilities to care for country,\" she said.\n\nThe body's plans to construct a tourism precinct at Conzinc Bay has stalled since it began in 2022, attracting some local dismay over the closure of the popular \"jump up\" four-wheel-drive track.\n\nIt would see a two-wheel-drive road installed leading to the picturesque inlet where MAC hopes to build an eco-resort.\n\nHowever, Ms Churnside said \"cultural sensitivities\" around the road design have delayed the works.\n\nConzinc Bay has been pegged for a tourism precinct since 2022. (Supplied: Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions)\n\nThe uncertainty extends to the makeshift shacks dotting several islands off Murujuga used by local fishers and surfers.\n\nBoth MAC and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation, and Attractions (DBCA) said the World Heritage listing would not directly impact access to the shacks.\n\nAny changes would come through the preparation of a new joint management plan, something the ABC understands is still being negotiated.\n\nJane Cheedy (right) wants to see tourism opportunities give back to her people. (ABC Pilbara: Charlie McLean)\n\nYindjibarndi elder Jane Cheedy said the World Heritage listing was a rare chance to share culture, protect country, and address economic inequality in the Pilbara.\n\n\"We, the traditional owners, are putting out our story and it's getting taken overseas, and then people will come to know more about Murujuga,\" she said.\n\n\"If it helps empower Aboriginal people that would be good.\"\n\nNo vacancy\n\nCity of Karratha Mayor Daniel Scott said the heritage listing presented a \"very large\" opportunity, but the area was not yet ready to cope with an increase in tourists.\n\n\"We're in an accommodation crisis at the moment,\" he said.\n\nHousing availability is a chronic challenge in Karratha, especially as a population increase looms.\n\nUtility vehicles set for mine sites line the car park at Karratha Airport. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nCr Scott called on investors to help get more accommodation online in Karratha.\n\n\"We've got everything here we need, now we just need the entrepreneurs and those people that see the opportunity to come to Karratha and help us take advantage of it,\" he said.\n\nEyes to the sky\n\nThe City of Karratha said an international airport was essential to make the most out of Murujuga's listing.\n\n\"I think it's a really, really big step forward and in justification for an international airport,\" Cr Scott said.\n\nThe City of Karratha is calling for Karratha's airport to be granted international status. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nThe only international airport in the Pilbara is in Port Hedland, a two-and-a-half-hour drive further north.\n\nIt has not serviced regular international flights since the COVID-19 pandemic, although a business case to resume those services is before state and federal authorities.\n\nA WA government spokesperson said tourism officials were continuing to assess all route development opportunities but would not comment on Karratha's bid for an international airport.\n\nThe Pilbara Tourism Association wants the region's Aboriginal history at the forefront of its marketing. (ABC News: Andrew Seabourne)\n\nPilbara Tourism Association chair Barry Harrison echoed the city's concerns about accommodation.\n\n\"So much accommodation is sucked up by mining and the resources sector,\" he said.\n\nMr Harrison said with the high cost of airfares, stronger marketing of the Pilbara's world-class Aboriginal history was needed to attract holiday-makers.\n\n\"As we've seen around the world, in other locations, people will just flock to this region to see it,\" he said.",

(AP: Jae C. Hong, File)\n\nUnlike most other internet service providers, Starlink uses a satellite internet constellation.\n\nIt is a wholly owned subsidiary of Elon Musk's space exploration company SpaceX.\n\nUsers in regional Australia have reported being impacted by the outage, posting in Facebook group Starlink Users Australia.\n\nStarlink is said to have 200,000 users in Australia and 6 million users globally.\n\nSpaceX has launched more than 8,000 Starlink satellites since 2020.\n\nIt now offers service in over 140 countries and territories.\n\nInternet expert suspects bad update\n\nDoug Madory, an expert at the internet analysis firm Kentik, said he was starting to see traffic come back at 5:28pm ET (7:58am AEST), after Starlink appeared to have experienced a \"total outage\" at about 3:13pm (5:13am AEST).\n\nThe outage was global, Mr Madory said, adding that such a sweeping interruption in service was unusual.\n\n\"This is likely the longest outage ever for Starlink, at least while it became a major service provider,\" Mr Madory said.\n\nSpaceX has launched more than 8,000 Starlink satellites since 2020. (Supplied: Starlink Satellite and Coverage Map)\n\nWith Starlink topping 6 million users worldwide, SpaceX is now focused on its nascent direct-to-cell business by adding larger satellites to its constellation to boost the network's internet speeds and bandwidth.\n\n\"I'd speculate this is a bad software update, not entirely dissimilar to the CrowdStrike mess with Windows last year, or a cyber attack,\" said Gregory Falco, director of a space and cybersecurity laboratory at Cornell University.\n\nAn update to CrowdStrike's widely used cybersecurity software led to worldwide flight cancellations and impacted industries around the globe in July last year.\n\nThe outage disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices.\n\nAs Starlink gained more users, SpaceX focused heavily in recent months on updating its network to accommodate demands for higher speed and bandwidth.\n\nIt was unclear whether Thursday's outage affected SpaceX's other satellite-based services that rely on the Starlink network.\n\nStarshield, the company's military satellite business unit, has billions of dollars' worth of contracts with the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies.\n\nUsers turn outage into memes\n\nSome Starlink users took the rare outage in good stride, sharing memes on X.\n\nOne user noted other internet service providers tended to have more frequent outages. Others joked about Mr Musk.\n\nABC/Reuters",

He slogged Jofra Archer for six before moving past 50, his 18th Test half-century.\n\nAfter Stokes had removed Washington Sundar (27) and debutant Anshul Kamboj (duck), Archer ended Pant's resistance by sending the injured wicket-keeper's off stump flying for 54.\n\n\"He was in a lot of pain,\" Thakur said.\n\n\"But we have seen him do amazing things.\n\n\"Today was just another amazing thing he did for this team. A lot was happening with the ball, so getting the amount of runs we did was not easy.\"\n\nPant has now amassed the most runs by a wicketkeeper in a series on English soil.\n\nReuters",

Bonnie Savage Previous Slide Next Slide 14.5 / 20 How we score Italian$$$$ Gambino is a huge deal for Glen Waverley, a south-eastern suburb rich in eating options but not so great for a Big Night Out. When this two-level venue opened last December, it instantly became the area\u2019s fanciest Italian place and its most glamorous rooftop, giving locals a reason to ditch the city or South Yarra for a full, fun evening closer to home: aperitivo, dinner and kick-ons all in one venue. At the station end of the Kingsway eating strip, a glass lift spills you into the fifth-floor restaurant, a chic, sleek, blue-velvet cave with lamp-lit tables. Could-be-anywhere views to the eastern hills are especially transporting from the semi-private lounge that\u2019s strung with fake but fab lemon branches. If the 90-seat restaurant is Milan, the sixth-floor rooftop is Capri, with accents in sunny yellow. Heaters and shutters do their darnedest to turn Melbourne winter into Euro summer, gamely assisted by spicy prawn pizza and cocktails like the \u201cstrawgroni\u201d with gin, berry-infused Campari and chocolate bitters. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no wheelchair access to the roof.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTomato caprese. Bonnie Savage The restaurant\u2019s smart menu allows you to steer casual or fine dining, with seasoned waiters helming the floor. Chef Adrian Li \u2013 also a partner in Armadale\u2019s Zia Rina\u2019s Cucina \u2013 became known at city hotel-diner La Madonna for his quirky spin on Caprese salad. He reprises it here: a whole tomato is deep-fried so the skin slips off cleanly. The scalped sphere is infused with soy sauce, stuffed with stracciatella cheese and served in a pool of basil oil, ready to ooze curds when cut. The drama is undeniable, but the fandangling makes me hanker for the original. I\u2019d rather wait for summer and eat a sun-drenched one. The signature bistecca al pepe - eye fillet steak topped with a pepper sauce-filled raviolo. Bonnie Savage The theatre curtain goes up again for eye fillet topped with a sturdy raviolo that releases 100 millilitres of mushroom sauce when pierced. This is a tricky dish and it pays off in spectacle, the flavoursome sauce pooling perfectly onto the plate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo make it, mushroom gravy is set with gelatin in a pasta parcel, ready to liquefy when simmered. Finessing the pasta thickness and filling consistency was so challenging that when Li nailed it, he nearly fell down the stairs running to announce his success. This is a tricky dish and it pays off in spectacle, the flavoursome sauce pooling perfectly onto the plate. I\u2019d probably take a tumble if I invented the excellent bombe Alaska. The sweetness of the meringue casing and sponge base is offset by a lemon-sorbet core and a semifreddo layer infused with finger lime. Flambeed at the table, it\u2019s a spiky ball of joy. It\u2019s not all bells and whistles. The crescentina, a fried-dough sandwich from Modena in northern Italy, is pure, button-pushing delight. Little pucks of pizza dough are filled with crisped mortadella, smoked mozzarella and pickled green tomato. A crudo of ruby-red tuna is overlaid with spice-cured prawns, the textures sublime but the chilli whack slightly overwhelming the lovely seafood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTortellini with pumpkin. Bonnie Savage Tortellini are filled with chive-spiked goat\u2019s curd and settled in a buttery emulsion with roasted pumpkin and parmesan cream, a vegetarian dish that\u2019s classic and refined. Everyone involved has a stake in the neighbourhood \u2013 and it shows. Two owners, Garen Maskal and Aret Arzadian, have Latin American The Black Toro, which has just clocked up 13 years on Kingsway.

    "text": "Affinity\u2019s debt burden is significant. In 2024, it spent about 19 per cent of its revenue from childcare on debt costs, which soared as it hoovered up smaller operators and built childcare centres. Loading The statements filed with ASIC show that Affinity spent about $344 million on wages in 2024, equating to 57 per cent of its revenue from childcare fees. This lags well behind the industry norm, with an ACCC report from last year finding the figure was about 70 per cent for the average daycare provider. In a response to this masthead, Affinity denied any underinvestment in staff via wages or poorer quality of service. Affinity noted that it met regulatory requirements for staffing, paid award wages and above, as well as retention-based bonus schemes.\n\nAffinity also rejected the suggestion that the quality of care at centres has worsened after it took them over. \u201cWhile the overwhelming majority of our 250 services across Australia deliver safe, excellent care, every day, we accept there is more we can do as an organisation, and as a sector, to improve,\u201d a spokesperson said. Tim Hickey, Affinity\u2019s chief executive, also played down the significance of a range of incidents that have landed the company negative publicity and in some cases regulatory action. These include a four-year-old being left unattended and restrained in a car seat on a bus for about 65 minutes in July 2021. Misconduct at the Milestones Early Learning Raby centre in NSW included an educator getting sacked after using a child to mop up vomit, and another employee being banned from working in childcare for 12 months after dragging a child up a cement ramp.\n\nAnother Affinity employee was banned from the sector for 12 months over a 2023 incident where they were filmed repeatedly slapping a baby. An Affinity centre in Spring Farm in NSW was suspended from operating for three months because of compliance failures, including medication failures, lack of supervision and qualified staff, and fake credentials. That centre had dropped from exceeding national quality standards to failing them within a year of Affinity taking ownership. Between 2021 and 2024, more than 1700 regulatory breaches were recorded against the company \u2013 an average of more than one a day. In response, Hickey said: \u201cWhile even a single failing is one too many, it is also important to acknowledge these incidents are not representative of the dedicated, professional team who care for children every day across thousands of centres. \u201cThe vast majority of people who work in early education, including those at Affinity, are deeply committed to nurturing, protecting, and educating children with compassion and integrity,\u201d Hickey said. He noted the company had invested more than $70 million on compliance, training, safety and care processes across its network in the past three years.\n\nThe sex abuse allegations have ensured the sector faces a significant rise in costs for compliance and monitoring to reassure parents that their children are safe. Loading And there will be a big stick waiting if they fall short: the government is now proposing legislation that could strip childcare centres of their taxpayer funding over a single breach. Affinity announced $10 million would be spent installing CCTV in all its centres, and lockboxes for smartphones, following the revelations of the charges against Brown. Questions about performance of its centres and financial woes will make it much harder for Affinity\u2019s owner, private equity group Quadrant, to flip the business with the returns needed to ensure the lucrative bonuses that the private equity sector is known for.\n\nAffinity\u2019s previous owner \u2013 local private equity group Anchorage Capital \u2013 hit the mother lode when it sold the group to Quadrant for $650 million cash in 2021. In five years, Anchorage had more than tripled its money with a profit of about $440 million for its investors. It also delivered a significant challenge for Quadrant: how do you make even more money to ensure they received the same multimillion-dollar bonuses enjoyed by Anchorage\u2019s executives? Acquiring more centres was part of the answer \u2013 childcare capacity is often used as an indicator of potential value \u2013 but parents who actually sent their young children to be cared for at the Affinity centres knew the bottom line. \u201cThis once was a wonderful centre, but now it has become all about the profits,\u201d Claire Ormiston said a year after the Anchorage acquired Affinity and its 160 centres for just $210 million in 2014.\n\nThe for-profit childcare sector can be a lucrative one for executives involved. Loading Affinity\u2019s CEO Hickey \u2013 the one constant since the group entered private equity control in 2015 \u2013 paid $6 million in 2021 for a luxury apartment at Kangaroo Point, a short walk from Brisbane\u2019s financial district. He also owns a five-bedroom house in Brisbane\u2019s waterside suburb of Hawthorne. The Quadrant executives who tried, and failed, to offload Affinity in 2023 for $1 billion are also used to the spoils of success. In 2020, Quadrant chairman Chris Hadley sold his Mosman mansion, with harbour views, gym, pool and its own wine cellar, to another Quadrant executive, Marcus Darville, for $10.9 million.",

    "text": "\u201cIt appears that we have crossed the line where a segment of the population has reached their limits. Loading \u201cThis is the beginning of a population death spiral.\u201d The UN\u2019s World Food Program says nearly 100,000 women and children urgently need treatment for malnutrition. Medical workers say they have run out of many key treatments and medicines. Israel, which began letting in only a trickle of supplies over the past two months, has blamed Hamas for disrupting food distribution. The UN counters that Israel, which has restricted aid since the war began, simply has to allow it to enter freely.\n\nHundreds of malnourished kids brought daily The Patient\u2019s Friends Hospital overflows with parents bringing in scrawny children \u2013 200 to 300 cases a day, Soboh said. On Wednesday, staff laid toddlers on a desk to measure the circumference of their upper arms \u2013 the quickest way to determine malnutrition. In the summer heat, mothers huddled around specialists, asking for supplements. Babies with emaciated limbs screamed in agony. Others lay totally silent. Naima Abu Ful and her two-year-old Yazan in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City. Credit: AP The worst cases are kept for up to two weeks at the centre\u2019s 10-bed ward, which this month has had up to 19 children at a time. It usually treats only children under five, but began taking some as old as 11 or 12 because of worsening starvation among older children.\n\nHunger gnaws at staff as well. Soboh said two nurses put themselves on IV drips to keep themselves going. \u201cWe are exhausted. We are dead in the shape of the living,\u201d she said. The five children died in succession last Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. Four of them, aged 4 months to 2 years, suffered gastric arrest: their stomachs shut down. The hospital no longer had the right nutrition supplies for them. The fifth \u2013 4\u00bd-year-old Siwar \u2013 had alarmingly low potassium levels, a growing problem. She was so weak she could barely move her body. Medicine for potassium deficiency has largely run out across Gaza, Soboh said. The centre had only a low-concentration potassium drip.\n\nThe little girl didn\u2019t respond. After three days in intensive care, she died on Saturday. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have potassium supplies, we will see more deaths,\u201d she said. Australia has joined 27 other nations in condemning Israel\u2019s \u201cdrip-feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic need of water and food\u201d. This image was taken in Gaza City on Tuesday. Credit: Anadolu via Getty Images A two-year-old is wasting away In the Shati Refugee Camp in Gaza City, two-year-old Yazan Abu Ful\u2019s mother, Naima, pulled off his clothes to show his emaciated body. His vertebrae, ribs and shoulder blades jutted out. His buttocks were shrivelled. His face was expressionless.\n\nHis father, Mahmoud, who was also skinny, said they took him to the hospital several times. Doctors just say they should feed him. \u201cI tell the doctors, \u2018You see for yourself, there is no food,\u2019\u201d he said. Naima, who is pregnant, prepared a meal: two eggplants they bought for $US9 ($14) cut up and boiled in water. They will stretch out the pot of eggplant-water \u2013 not even a real soup \u2013 to last them a few days, they said. Several of Yazan\u2019s four older siblings also looked thin and drained. Israeli activists take part in a protest against the war. Credit: AP Holding him in his lap, Mahmoud Abu Ful lifted Yazan\u2019s limp arms. The boy lies on the floor most of the day, too weak to play with his brothers. \u201cIf we leave him, he might just slip away from between our fingers, and we can\u2019t do anything.\u201d Adults, too, are dying\n\nStarvation takes the vulnerable first, experts say: children and adults with health conditions. On Thursday, the bodies of an adult man and woman with signs of starvation were brought to Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital, hospital director Mohammed Abu Selmia said. One suffered from diabetes, the other from a heart condition, but they showed severe deficiencies of nutrients, gastric arrest and anaemia from malnutrition. Mourners gather around the bodies of people killed while trying to reach aid trucks. Credit: AP Many of the adults who have died had some sort of pre-existing condition, like diabetes or heart or kidney trouble, worsened by malnutrition, Abu Selmia said. \u201cThese diseases don\u2019t kill if they have food and medicine,\u201d he said. Deaths come after months of Israeli siege\n\nIsrael cut off the entry of food, medicine, fuel and other supplies completely to Gaza for 2\u00bd months starting in March, saying it aimed to pressure Hamas to release hostages. During that time, food largely ran out for aid groups and in marketplaces, and experts warned Gaza was headed for an outright famine. In late May, Israel slightly eased the blockade. Since then, it had allowed in about 4500 trucks for the UN and other aid groups to distribute, including 2500 tonnes of baby food and high-calorie special food for children, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday. Wateen is suffering from severe malnutrition. Credit: MSF That is an average of 69 trucks a day, far below the 500 to 600 trucks a day the UN says are needed. The UN has been unable to distribute much of the aid because hungry crowds and gangs take most of it from its trucks. Separately, Israel has also backed the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which opened four centres distributing boxes of food supplies. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed trying to reach the sites. On Tuesday, Israeli prime minister\u2019s office spokesman David Mencer denied there was a \u201cfamine created by Israel\u201d in Gaza and blamed Hamas for creating \u201cman-made shortages\u201d by looting aid trucks.",

Credit: TikTok\n\nIn statements supplied to numerous media outlets in the United States, including Page Six and TMZ , a spokesperson for the New York-based company confirmed that Cabot, who joined its C-suite in late 2024, is \u201cno longer with Astronomer\u201d and had \u201cresigned\u201d. It comes days after Byron, who was appointed Astronomer\u2019s chief executive in 2023, resigned from his job leading the AI data orchestration software start-up.\n\nBut when Byron, who was shown swaying to the music with his arms draped around Cabot at Gillette Stadium on the evening of July 16 (July 17 AEST), and the former HR executive realised they were on-screen, Byron quickly sunk to the floor, out of sight of the camera, while Cabot hid her face in her hands and turned around.\n\n\u2018The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name.\u2019 Pete DeJoy, Astronomer interim chief executive\n\nAdding fuel to the fire was Martin\u2019s wry commentary from the stage, with the Yellow singer saying into the microphone: \u201cOh, look at these two ... Either they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re very shy.\u201d\n\nBoth Byron and Cabot are believed to have been married to other people at the time, and neither Byron nor Cabot has publicly commented on the incident, their exits from Astronomer or the affair allegations. This masthead is not suggesting the allegations of an affair between Byron and Cabot are true, just that they have been made.\n\nNo one could have predicted the sheer fervour with which the whole world would latch on to the seconds-long moment in Foxborough, Massachusetts that 28-year-old Grace Springer, from New Jersey, shared footage of on TikTok. It\u2019s been referenced beyond social media to Oasis concerts, comedy shows, breakfast television and sports games.",

Trump has said he wants to remove Powell but likely lacks the legal authority to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn awkward exchange played out in front of reporters when Trump claimed the price tag for the renovation at the US' central bank was US$3.1 billion ($4.7 billion). Powell closed his eyes and shook his head before responding: \"I haven't heard that from anybody.\"\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said Donald Trump had factored in the cost of a previously completed project after the US president claimed there had been a cost blowout in the renovation of the central bank's headquarters. Source: AAP, AP / Julia Demaree Nikhinson Trump produced a sheet of paper apparently listing construction costs and was told curtly he was including work on the William McChesney Martin Jr Building which was not part of the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You just added in a third building,\" Powell said, adding it was a renovation completed five years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump went on to ask Powell if he expected additional cost overruns, to which he replied: \"Don't expect them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked by a reporter what, in his career as a real estate developer, he would do if a project manager went over budget, Trump said: \"Generally speaking ... I would fire them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this week, Trump has toned down his threats to fire Powell. When calling him a \"numbskull\" who had \"done a bad job\" earlier this week, Trump said he would be out in eight months. That, however, would still be a couple of months out from the end of his term in May 2026. It was unclear why Trump picked that time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd after the visit, Trump said he did not intend to fire Powell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To do so is a big move and I just don't think it's necessary,\" he told reporters.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What would the fallout be if Donald Trump tries to fire the Federal Reserve chief?\n\nElevated by Trump to the top Fed job in 2018 and then reappointed by former president Joe Biden four years later, Powell last met with the president in March when Trump summoned him to the White House to press him to lower rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has criticised Powell for months over his insistence on keeping the short-term interest rate at 4.3 per cent this year, after cutting it three times last year, when Biden was in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visibly tense interaction between the pair comes less than a week before the central bank's 19 policymakers are due to gather for a two-day rate-setting meeting, where they are widely expected to leave their benchmark interest rate in the 4.25 to 4.50 per cent range.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has repeatedly demanded Powell slash rates by 3 percentage points or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd love him to lower interest rates,\" Trump said as he wrapped up the tour, as Powell stood by, his face expressionless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With reporting by the Agence France-Presse and Reuters news agencies\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Families are spending thousands \u2014 and in some cases, over a million dollars \u2014 to buy homes within the catchment zones of top-performing public high schools, according to new research.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the analysis by property data firm Cotality also suggests that paying more upfront does not necessarily mean greater long-term price growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report looked at house prices in nine popular school catchment zones across Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn seven of those zones, homes inside the catchment were more expensive than similar homes nearby but outside the boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, six of those catchments recorded weaker capital growth over the past 15 years.\n\n\n\nEliza Owen, head of residential research at Cotality, said the results confirm what many buyers already suspect, that popular school zones often come with a hefty housing premium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These premiums may reflect the value placed on getting into top public schools, but it could also reflect an array of other factors like proximity to train stations, or the high incomes of those living inside the catchment area,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe economics of catchment area homes\n\nHomes in the combined catchments of Killara High, Willoughby Girls and Lindfield Learning Village in Sydney's North Shore held a median value of nearly $1.3 million higher than homes nearby but outside the catchment.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this, houses in the catchment recorded lower long-term growth of 126 per cent over the past 15 years, compared to 150 per cent in neighbouring areas.\n\n\n\nIn Melbourne, the premium for homes in the catchments of Princes Hill and University High School reached $357,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital growth was again weaker than that of the surrounding suburbs, with in-catchment homes growing by 82.6 per cent over 15 years, compared to 106 per cent in nearby areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nOwen said as affordability has worsened in many good school catchment areas, this may have contributed to a spill-over in demand outside of the zones, leading to lower total capital growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In many cases, that means the premium has trended lower over time,\" she said.\n\n\n\nNot all school zone homes cost more\n\nThe report also found areas where homes inside a high-performing catchment were actually cheaper than those outside.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouses in Sydney's Cherrybrook Technology High School catchment were $155,000 lower than those outside the boundary in the same suburbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Melbourne, houses in the Doncaster Secondary College catchment were $48,000 lower than those outside the zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For many families, buying into a strong public school zone may still be a more affordable alternative to private education,\" a statement from Cotality said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Futurity Investment Group, the average cost of 13 years of private education in Australia was estimated at $349,000 in 2022, with significantly higher costs in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In six of the nine regions we analysed, the house price premium within public school zones was at least 100,000 dollars,\" Owen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While that\u2019s a significant upfront cost, it could end up saving families money when compared to paying for private schooling over many years.\"\n\n\n\n",

So seeing them go from, I can't even put my face into the water, to (now) I can go to my friend's barbecue and hop in their pool and swim confidently and swim safely.

Source: AAP / Christophe Petit Tesson / EPA Starting the day with a deficit of 4 minutes and 15 seconds, Vingegaard had attacked 71km out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our tactics fell apart when they attacked so soon,\" said Poga\u010dar, explaining he simply tracked his rival on instinct.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar eventually dropped the Dane near the finish line to gain another 11 seconds on the Team Visma rider who won the 2022 and 2023 Tour de France.\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Connor, from the Jayco-Alula team, said he was relieved to triumph again four years after his success in the Alps at Tignes.\n\n\n\n\"Putting your hands in the air is an extraordinary thing. It was about time for me being an Aussie rider in an Aussie team,\" said a beaming O'Connor, who joined Jayco in January.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had to go from the bottom of the valley before the last climb.

It's so long this three weeks thing. You get annoyed with everybody by the third week. You need good legs and good luck and only then is it okay,\" added Poga\u010dar.\n\n\n\nGerman breakout star Florian Lipowitz wilted near the end in his bid for both third place and the white jersey awarded to the best young rider.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 22-year-old Scottish rider Oscar Onley closed to within 22 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth riders are making their Tour de France debut.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race ends Sunday in Paris with the finish line at the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es after three climbs to the Sacre Coeur Basilica along the cobbled lanes of Montmartre.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

Some effects stem from disasters such as cyclones that ravaged the Pacific nation many years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We still see broken schools and homes, essential facilities like health centres and clinics. We see our coastlines being eroded, and sea levels rising,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very sad to see.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why over a third of this nation's citizens want to migrate to Australia\n\nTrief was among the youngest members of any nation's official delegation to travel to The Hague last year as part of a case brought to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the responsibilities of countries to address climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nOvernight, the ICJ issued its advisory opinion , which states that countries have an obligation to prevent harm from climate change and redress damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrief was \"ecstatic\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was amazing \u2014 a very emotional moment for all my friends and family. It [the ruling] has so many implications for our future, and for climate justice as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ICJ opinion follows a recent Federal Court ruling in Australia that found the Commonwealth does not have a duty of care to protect Torres Strait Islanders from climate change.\n\n\n\nA 'significant reset' of international law\n\nActivists and experts have welcomed the non-binding opinion issued by the 15-judge panel, with some saying it opens up pathways for states \u2014 including Australia \u2014 to be held accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's a landmark case,\" said Siobhan McDonnell, an associate professor at the Australian National University. She is also a climate change negotiator and adviser to Vanuatu, and was involved at the start of the ICJ case in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an incredibly historic opinion. People sometimes say that about cases \u2014 I think in this case, it's incredibly true.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonnell said the decision was \"a very significant reset of the understanding of international law at the moment\".\n\n\n\nThe coastline of Port Vila, Vanuatu, pictured several years ago, is under threat due to climate change. Source: Getty / Mario Tama Aidan Craney, a lecturer and research fellow in the Centre for Human Security and Social Change at La Trobe University and whose research focuses on youth leadership and livelihoods in the Pacific, also called it a \"historic ruling\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the largest body of evidence that the court has ever had to work with,\" Craney said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Examining that evidence, the court supported the consensus from scientists: climate change is real, climate change is driven by human actions such as the burning of fossil fuels, and that we need to keep global warming below 1.5C for the best chance to preserve our environment and way of life.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does the ICJ opinion set out?\n\nThe ICJ's opinion sets out several key obligations, McDonnell explained. Importantly, it recognises the international obligation on all states to mitigate the impacts of carbon emissions, and to maintain a global temperature of 1.5C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To collectively work to maintain that temperature, it recognises that all states have an obligation to limit fossil fuel production and fossil fuel consumption, which includes the granting of exploration licenses and provision of fossil fuel subsidies,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It recognises that if states fail to protect the climate system from global greenhouse gas emissions, that may give rise to legal consequences.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advisory opinion also recognises that states have international human rights obligations, including to ensure life, health, and clean and safe environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All together, that set of obligations is going to have a really profound implication, I think for both future climate litigation and for climate negotiations between states in the United Nations and under various treaties,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\n\nWhich obligations could impact Australia?\n\nMcDonnell pointed to two obligations that could have \"very immediate significance\" for Australia \u2014 the first being maintaining a 1.5C pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a lot of debate about whether Australia is meeting its current obligations in terms of its pathway to net zero for 2050 or its 2035 commitments, and whether that is consistent with the existing climate science,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the terms of the Paris Agreement, a country must update its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) every five years. Australia's updated NDC, which will include its 2035 target, is due this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The whole of the Pacific is waiting to see what Australia is going to submit in terms of a 1.5 degree pathway,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meet the young people who could outlive their own country\n\nShe said obligations to limit fossil fuel production and consumption are \"major issues for Australia\" and other fossil fuel-producing nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The judgement particularly talks about the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses and subsidies, and it says that these may constitute an internationally wrongful act, which is attributable to states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It goes on to say that these acts may constitute a breach of customary obligations and that breach may result in the right to reparations and compensation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCraney said the ruling opens up pathways for states to be held accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Importantly for Australia, legal avenues have now been opened for reparations payments from high-emitting countries to low-emitting countries,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How Australia responds to this ruling will have dramatic implications for its relationships with its Pacific neighbours. We can either show solidarity or lose all legitimacy.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE More than sandbags: Torres Strait councils demand more government action on climate after class action fails\n\nAn Australian government spokesperson said it will \"carefully consider the court's opinion\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia was proud to join the Pacific in co-sponsoring this Vanuatu-led initiative and to participate in the proceedings last year,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We recognise that climate change is one of the greatest existential threats to all humanity, and that it\u2019s having a significant effect on our region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The unprecedented participation by other countries in the ICJ proceedings reflects that we\u2019re not alone in recognising the challenges and opportunities of responding to climate change.\"\n\n\n\nClimate cases 'increasingly' being brought to courts\n\nIsabelle Reinecke is the executive director of Grata Fund, which supported Torres Strait Islander Elders Uncle Pabai Pabai and Uncle Paul Kabai in their case against the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile accepting many of the key facts the Uncles had presented to the court regarding the effects of human-induced climate change on the Torres Strait Islands, Judge Michael Wigney ruled there was not a duty of care under negligence law.\n\n\n\n\"This month, the Federal Court found that Torres Strait people and culture are being 'ravaged by human-induced climate change', and that the Australian government 'paid scant, if any, regard to the best available science' when setting its emissions targets,\" Reinecke said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Communities in Australia and around the world are increasingly bringing climate cases to courts of all levels.

    "text": "The federal government has lifted a ban on beef imports from the United States, expanding access to products sourced from Canada and Mexico. It's a move some experts say risks Australia's biosecurity and may be politically motivated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the US has been able to send beef to Australia since 2019, any cattle raised in Canada or Mexico before being slaughtered and processed in the US was previously barred due to biosecurity concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, following a decade-long science-based review, that restriction is gone, and will expand access to include beef sourced from cattle born in Canada or Mexico, which is legally imported and slaughtered in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some question whether Australia's strict biosecurity laws are being used for political gain, with the government facing questions over whether the move was made to appease US President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meet the Australian farmers Donald Trump has a beef with\n\nBiosecurity concerns\n\nOne key concern was that Mexico's livestock tracking system could inadvertently allow beef from disease-affected regions to enter Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said the new changes follow the introduction of more robust movement controls in the US in late 2024 and early 2025, allowing for better tracing of cattle through the supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said the US review began in December 2015 under the Coalition Government, alongside beef imports in other countries like Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Vanuatu.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Michael Ward, a veterinary public health expert at the University of Sydney, said the decision opens Australia up to more risk because disease traceability in North America is \"not quite as strong\" as in Europe. Australia allows imports of beef products from a limited number of European countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can potentially have cattle coming from lower disease status areas caught up in what gets exported, and then trying to work out where it's come from, that becomes really difficult,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"You can't really [separate those markets] in the US because it's such a bigger market and it's integrated \u2026 If a cow is moved to the US and it's there for three months, is it then an American cow?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're basically increasing the pool of potentially risky animals, and that then flows into the risk assessment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main risks associated with beef imports are the introduction of diseases such as mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll North American countries are free of foot and mouth disease, and have the status of 'negligible risk' of a mad cow disease outbreak by the World Organisation for Animal Health. Both Canada and the US have had some cases in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nWard said it's not \"reasonable to believe all three countries have the same risk\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Should there be a carbon tax on beef?\n\n\"They\u2019re different systems, different countries, different raising conditions, different administrations. As you increase the number of countries, you're going to increase the risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture said the review was the culmination of \"a decade of science and risk-based import assessment and evaluation \u2026 to make sure Australia\u2019s robust biosecurity measures are upheld\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is satisfied the strengthened control measures put in place by the US effectively manage biosecurity risks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey added that the government would \"not compromise on our enviable biosecurity status or our food standards, ever\".\n\n\n\nIs biosecurity being used as a bargaining tool?\n\nSome believe the change could help Australia negotiate a better trade deal with the US \u2014 particularly on tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of his sweeping global tariffs, Trump introduced a baseline 10 per cent tariff on many Australian goods in April.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Australians] ban American beef,\" Trump said at the time. \"Yet, we imported [US]$3 billion ($4.5 billion) of Australian beef from them just last year alone \u2026 They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud has accused the Albanese government of using the beef industry to appease Trump as it continues to pursue a broader tariff exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It looks as though it's [biosecurity] been traded away to appease Donald Trump,\" Littleproud said on ABC\u2019s Radio National on Thursday.\n\n\n\nCoalition frontbencher James Paterson called on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to \"stand up ... and explain\" to Australia's beef farmers that the government hasn't \"watered down\" biosecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWard is also concerned the government is \"playing off\" biosecurity protections to secure a better deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seems like a trade-driven decision,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe warned that the short-term economic gain from lifting tariffs could pale in comparison to the potential cost of a disease outbreak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a huge concern \u2014 once you have introduced a disease \u2014 foot and mouth disease, for example \u2014 years and years and millions of dollars are spent trying to control that,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That short-term gain \u2014 if it is tariff-driven \u2014 whether what the benefit of that is compared to a long-term disease scenario, it just doesn't add up. You really have to think about the long-term.\"\n\n\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell has denied any link between the decision and pressure from the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's nothing suspicious about this,\" he told Sky News. \"If we want to export our beef overseas, then we have to accept that other countries will want to import their beef into Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not going to allow our biosecurity rules to be impacted by the trade issues.\"\n\n\n\nHow has the industry responded?\n\nThe report has now been made public , but some industry groups expressed frustration over the lack of earlier transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Science must remain the cornerstone of technical market access decisions,\" Australian Meat Industry Council CEO Tim Ryan said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This progress on the US\u2019s access request demonstrates Australia\u2019s consistency in applying internationally recognised standards, which is vital to the long-term sustainability of our sector.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Farmers Federation (NFF) said the decision needed to come \"separate from any tariff negotiations\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The NFF's been clear that the revised request from the US needed to undergo the standard, science-based assessment to protect our biosecurity, and should be dealt with separate from any tariff negotiations,\" the organisation said in a statement.\n\n\n\nCattle Australia CEO Will Evans said the announcement came without proper consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of people today who feel blindsided by this, there's going to be a lot of people who are going to feel really frustrated and threatened by this,\" he told ABC radio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis science-based process has been, and always should be, conducted completely independently of any international trade negotiations,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a government spokesperson said officials have \"regularly and extensively engaged key industry stakeholders\", including Cattle Australia, The Australian Meat Industry Council, and the Red Meat Advisory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe department added that the industry was briefed ahead of the final release of the review.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith additional reporting from AAP.\n\n\n\n",

Bonnie Savage Previous Slide Next Slide 14.5 / 20 How we score Italian$$$$ Gambino is a huge deal for Glen Waverley, a south-eastern suburb rich in eating options but not so great for a Big Night Out. When this two-level venue opened last December, it instantly became the area\u2019s fanciest Italian place and its most glamorous rooftop, giving locals a reason to ditch the city or South Yarra for a full, fun evening closer to home: aperitivo, dinner and kick-ons all in one venue. At the station end of the Kingsway eating strip, a glass lift spills you into the fifth-floor restaurant, a chic, sleek, blue-velvet cave with lamp-lit tables. Could-be-anywhere views to the eastern hills are especially transporting from the semi-private lounge that\u2019s strung with fake but fab lemon branches. If the 90-seat restaurant is Milan, the sixth-floor rooftop is Capri, with accents in sunny yellow. Heaters and shutters do their darnedest to turn Melbourne winter into Euro summer, gamely assisted by spicy prawn pizza and cocktails like the \u201cstrawgroni\u201d with gin, berry-infused Campari and chocolate bitters. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no wheelchair access to the roof.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTomato caprese. Bonnie Savage The restaurant\u2019s smart menu allows you to steer casual or fine dining, with seasoned waiters helming the floor. Chef Adrian Li \u2013 also a partner in Armadale\u2019s Zia Rina\u2019s Cucina \u2013 became known at city hotel-diner La Madonna for his quirky spin on Caprese salad. He reprises it here: a whole tomato is deep-fried so the skin slips off cleanly. The scalped sphere is infused with soy sauce, stuffed with stracciatella cheese and served in a pool of basil oil, ready to ooze curds when cut. The drama is undeniable, but the fandangling makes me hanker for the original. I\u2019d rather wait for summer and eat a sun-drenched one. The signature bistecca al pepe - eye fillet steak topped with a pepper sauce-filled raviolo. Bonnie Savage The theatre curtain goes up again for eye fillet topped with a sturdy raviolo that releases 100 millilitres of mushroom sauce when pierced. This is a tricky dish and it pays off in spectacle, the flavoursome sauce pooling perfectly onto the plate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo make it, mushroom gravy is set with gelatin in a pasta parcel, ready to liquefy when simmered. Finessing the pasta thickness and filling consistency was so challenging that when Li nailed it, he nearly fell down the stairs running to announce his success. This is a tricky dish and it pays off in spectacle, the flavoursome sauce pooling perfectly onto the plate. I\u2019d probably take a tumble if I invented the excellent bombe Alaska. The sweetness of the meringue casing and sponge base is offset by a lemon-sorbet core and a semifreddo layer infused with finger lime. Flambeed at the table, it\u2019s a spiky ball of joy. It\u2019s not all bells and whistles. The crescentina, a fried-dough sandwich from Modena in northern Italy, is pure, button-pushing delight. Little pucks of pizza dough are filled with crisped mortadella, smoked mozzarella and pickled green tomato. A crudo of ruby-red tuna is overlaid with spice-cured prawns, the textures sublime but the chilli whack slightly overwhelming the lovely seafood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTortellini with pumpkin. Bonnie Savage Tortellini are filled with chive-spiked goat\u2019s curd and settled in a buttery emulsion with roasted pumpkin and parmesan cream, a vegetarian dish that\u2019s classic and refined. Everyone involved has a stake in the neighbourhood \u2013 and it shows. Two owners, Garen Maskal and Aret Arzadian, have Latin American The Black Toro, which has just clocked up 13 years on Kingsway. Their business partner here is Craig Lane, a longtime hairdresser in the \u2019hood and owner of several nearby eateries. Chef Li grew up down the road and is keen to see the area thrive. Gambino is an optimistic outreach to locals: spend close to home and be rewarded with class and generosity.

    "text": "Affinity\u2019s debt burden is significant. In 2024, it spent about 19 per cent of its revenue from childcare on debt costs, which soared as it hoovered up smaller operators and built childcare centres. Loading The statements filed with ASIC show that Affinity spent about $344 million on wages in 2024, equating to 57 per cent of its revenue from childcare fees. This lags well behind the industry norm, with an ACCC report from last year finding the figure was about 70 per cent for the average daycare provider. In a response to this masthead, Affinity denied any underinvestment in staff via wages or poorer quality of service. Affinity noted that it met regulatory requirements for staffing, paid award wages and above, as well as retention-based bonus schemes.\n\nAffinity also rejected the suggestion that the quality of care at centres has worsened after it took them over. \u201cWhile the overwhelming majority of our 250 services across Australia deliver safe, excellent care, every day, we accept there is more we can do as an organisation, and as a sector, to improve,\u201d a spokesperson said. Tim Hickey, Affinity\u2019s chief executive, also played down the significance of a range of incidents that have landed the company negative publicity and in some cases regulatory action. These include a four-year-old being left unattended and restrained in a car seat on a bus for about 65 minutes in July 2021. Misconduct at the Milestones Early Learning Raby centre in NSW included an educator getting sacked after using a child to mop up vomit, and another employee being banned from working in childcare for 12 months after dragging a child up a cement ramp.\n\nAnother Affinity employee was banned from the sector for 12 months over a 2023 incident where they were filmed repeatedly slapping a baby. An Affinity centre in Spring Farm in NSW was suspended from operating for three months because of compliance failures, including medication failures, lack of supervision and qualified staff, and fake credentials. That centre had dropped from exceeding national quality standards to failing them within a year of Affinity taking ownership. Between 2021 and 2024, more than 1700 regulatory breaches were recorded against the company \u2013 an average of more than one a day. In response, Hickey said: \u201cWhile even a single failing is one too many, it is also important to acknowledge these incidents are not representative of the dedicated, professional team who care for children every day across thousands of centres. \u201cThe vast majority of people who work in early education, including those at Affinity, are deeply committed to nurturing, protecting, and educating children with compassion and integrity,\u201d Hickey said. He noted the company had invested more than $70 million on compliance, training, safety and care processes across its network in the past three years.\n\nThe sex abuse allegations have ensured the sector faces a significant rise in costs for compliance and monitoring to reassure parents that their children are safe. Loading And there will be a big stick waiting if they fall short: the government is now proposing legislation that could strip childcare centres of their taxpayer funding over a single breach. Affinity announced $10 million would be spent installing CCTV in all its centres, and lockboxes for smartphones, following the revelations of the charges against Brown. Questions about performance of its centres and financial woes will make it much harder for Affinity\u2019s owner, private equity group Quadrant, to flip the business with the returns needed to ensure the lucrative bonuses that the private equity sector is known for.\n\nAffinity\u2019s previous owner \u2013 local private equity group Anchorage Capital \u2013 hit the mother lode when it sold the group to Quadrant for $650 million cash in 2021. In five years, Anchorage had more than tripled its money with a profit of about $440 million for its investors. It also delivered a significant challenge for Quadrant: how do you make even more money to ensure they received the same multimillion-dollar bonuses enjoyed by Anchorage\u2019s executives? Acquiring more centres was part of the answer \u2013 childcare capacity is often used as an indicator of potential value \u2013 but parents who actually sent their young children to be cared for at the Affinity centres knew the bottom line. \u201cThis once was a wonderful centre, but now it has become all about the profits,\u201d Claire Ormiston said a year after the Anchorage acquired Affinity and its 160 centres for just $210 million in 2014.\n\nThe for-profit childcare sector can be a lucrative one for executives involved. Loading Affinity\u2019s CEO Hickey \u2013 the one constant since the group entered private equity control in 2015 \u2013 paid $6 million in 2021 for a luxury apartment at Kangaroo Point, a short walk from Brisbane\u2019s financial district. He also owns a five-bedroom house in Brisbane\u2019s waterside suburb of Hawthorne. The Quadrant executives who tried, and failed, to offload Affinity in 2023 for $1 billion are also used to the spoils of success. In 2020, Quadrant chairman Chris Hadley sold his Mosman mansion, with harbour views, gym, pool and its own wine cellar, to another Quadrant executive, Marcus Darville, for $10.9 million.",

Loading \u201cThis is the beginning of a population death spiral.\u201d The UN\u2019s World Food Program says nearly 100,000 women and children urgently need treatment for malnutrition. Medical workers say they have run out of many key treatments and medicines. Israel, which began letting in only a trickle of supplies over the past two months, has blamed Hamas for disrupting food distribution. The UN counters that Israel, which has restricted aid since the war began, simply has to allow it to enter freely.\n\nHundreds of malnourished kids brought daily The Patient\u2019s Friends Hospital overflows with parents bringing in scrawny children \u2013 200 to 300 cases a day, Soboh said. On Wednesday, staff laid toddlers on a desk to measure the circumference of their upper arms \u2013 the quickest way to determine malnutrition. In the summer heat, mothers huddled around specialists, asking for supplements. Babies with emaciated limbs screamed in agony. Others lay totally silent.

Credit: AP The worst cases are kept for up to two weeks at the centre\u2019s 10-bed ward, which this month has had up to 19 children at a time. It usually treats only children under five, but began taking some as old as 11 or 12 because of worsening starvation among older children.\n\nHunger gnaws at staff as well. Soboh said two nurses put themselves on IV drips to keep themselves going. \u201cWe are exhausted. We are dead in the shape of the living,\u201d she said. The five children died in succession last Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. Four of them, aged 4 months to 2 years, suffered gastric arrest: their stomachs shut down. The hospital no longer had the right nutrition supplies for them. The fifth \u2013 4\u00bd-year-old Siwar \u2013 had alarmingly low potassium levels, a growing problem. She was so weak she could barely move her body. Medicine for potassium deficiency has largely run out across Gaza, Soboh said. The centre had only a low-concentration potassium drip.\n\nThe little girl didn\u2019t respond. After three days in intensive care, she died on Saturday. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have potassium supplies, we will see more deaths,\u201d she said. Australia has joined 27 other nations in condemning Israel\u2019s \u201cdrip-feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic need of water and food\u201d. This image was taken in Gaza City on Tuesday. Credit: Anadolu via Getty Images A two-year-old is wasting away In the Shati Refugee Camp in Gaza City, two-year-old Yazan Abu Ful\u2019s mother, Naima, pulled off his clothes to show his emaciated body. His vertebrae, ribs and shoulder blades jutted out. His buttocks were shrivelled. His face was expressionless.\n\nHis father, Mahmoud, who was also skinny, said they took him to the hospital several times. Doctors just say they should feed him. \u201cI tell the doctors, \u2018You see for yourself, there is no food,\u2019\u201d he said. Naima, who is pregnant, prepared a meal: two eggplants they bought for $US9 ($14) cut up and boiled in water. They will stretch out the pot of eggplant-water \u2013 not even a real soup \u2013 to last them a few days, they said. Several of Yazan\u2019s four older siblings also looked thin and drained.

On Thursday, the bodies of an adult man and woman with signs of starvation were brought to Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital, hospital director Mohammed Abu Selmia said. One suffered from diabetes, the other from a heart condition, but they showed severe deficiencies of nutrients, gastric arrest and anaemia from malnutrition. Mourners gather around the bodies of people killed while trying to reach aid trucks. Credit: AP Many of the adults who have died had some sort of pre-existing condition, like diabetes or heart or kidney trouble, worsened by malnutrition, Abu Selmia said. \u201cThese diseases don\u2019t kill if they have food and medicine,\u201d he said. Deaths come after months of Israeli siege\n\nIsrael cut off the entry of food, medicine, fuel and other supplies completely to Gaza for 2\u00bd months starting in March, saying it aimed to pressure Hamas to release hostages. During that time, food largely ran out for aid groups and in marketplaces, and experts warned Gaza was headed for an outright famine. In late May, Israel slightly eased the blockade. Since then, it had allowed in about 4500 trucks for the UN and other aid groups to distribute, including 2500 tonnes of baby food and high-calorie special food for children, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday. Wateen is suffering from severe malnutrition. Credit: MSF That is an average of 69 trucks a day, far below the 500 to 600 trucks a day the UN says are needed. The UN has been unable to distribute much of the aid because hungry crowds and gangs take most of it from its trucks. Separately, Israel has also backed the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which opened four centres distributing boxes of food supplies. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed trying to reach the sites. On Tuesday, Israeli prime minister\u2019s office spokesman David Mencer denied there was a \u201cfamine created by Israel\u201d in Gaza and blamed Hamas for creating \u201cman-made shortages\u201d by looting aid trucks.",

Credit: TikTok\n\nIn statements supplied to numerous media outlets in the United States, including Page Six and TMZ , a spokesperson for the New York-based company confirmed that Cabot, who joined its C-suite in late 2024, is \u201cno longer with Astronomer\u201d and had \u201cresigned\u201d. It comes days after Byron, who was appointed Astronomer\u2019s chief executive in 2023, resigned from his job leading the AI data orchestration software start-up.\n\nBut when Byron, who was shown swaying to the music with his arms draped around Cabot at Gillette Stadium on the evening of July 16 (July 17 AEST), and the former HR executive realised they were on-screen, Byron quickly sunk to the floor, out of sight of the camera, while Cabot hid her face in her hands and turned around.\n\n\u2018The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name.\u2019 Pete DeJoy, Astronomer interim chief executive\n\nAdding fuel to the fire was Martin\u2019s wry commentary from the stage, with the Yellow singer saying into the microphone: \u201cOh, look at these two ... Either they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re very shy.\u201d\n\nBoth Byron and Cabot are believed to have been married to other people at the time, and neither Byron nor Cabot has publicly commented on the incident, their exits from Astronomer or the affair allegations. This masthead is not suggesting the allegations of an affair between Byron and Cabot are true, just that they have been made.\n\nNo one could have predicted the sheer fervour with which the whole world would latch on to the seconds-long moment in Foxborough, Massachusetts that 28-year-old Grace Springer, from New Jersey, shared footage of on TikTok. It\u2019s been referenced beyond social media to Oasis concerts, comedy shows, breakfast television and sports games.",

    "text": "The parking sign in the affluent Sydney suburb is going viral and dividing drivers. Can you understand it?\n\nIt's well talked about how it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find parking in built-up areas across Australia's major cities. But even when drivers do nab a spot, it can sometimes be hard to decipher the complex parking rules that govern inner-metro streets\n\nThat appeared to be the case for one Sydney driver this week, who was caught on camera staring in a prolonged state up at a parking sign with no less than five different instructions and an array of differing times. A fellow driver in Paddington spotted the woman seeming to be utterly confused, and admitted she too was lost trying to understand the instructions.\n\nThe driver joked she was sending \"thoughts and prayers\" to woman.\n\n\"I don't blame you love, because someone tell me what that means,\" she said in a a clip that has been watched more than 330,000 times in about 24 hours.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe viral clip ultimately sparked a mixed reaction online with some claiming the instructions were straightforward while others were a little less sure.\n\n*Answer at the bottom.\n\nAussies say 'yeah, nah' to complicated parking sign\n\nAustralian drivers flooded the comments section admitting they too were perplexed by the instructions.\n\n\"Absolutely not, I'm parking somewhere else. All I'm seeing is that you're going to cop a fine,\" one person said, while another called the sign \"unnecessarily complicated\". A third simply said, \"yeah, nah\" to the whole thing.\n\nHowever many others claimed to know exactly what the sign was trying to communicate, and argued anyone who couldn't piece it together \"shouldn't be driving\".\n\n\"There's nothing complicated about this. It make sense,\" one woman claimed, while another driver called it \"very easy to read\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nParking instructions decoded\n\nThe parking sign details the spot to the left of the pole is a loading zone between 8am and 10.30am everyday, but then changes to two-hour ticketed parking between 10.30 am and 4 pm, and between 7 and 9pm, Monday to Friday. During 4pm to 7pm on weekdays there is no parking as a bus lane operates. On the weekends, two-hour ticketed parking is allowed between 10.30am and 9pm.\n\nIn 2022, Sydney trialled digital road signs in a bid to make parking instructions easier to understand for drivers. However, they were not widely adopted.\n\n*Answer: No, it's a loading zone.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
