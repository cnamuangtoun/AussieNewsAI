    "text": "When single mum Nicole Mahoney's twin baby boys arrived 12 weeks early, all her carefully laid maternity leave plans were thrown into disarray.\n\nThe twins, Angus and Hugh, were both born weighing just 1.1 kilograms and were not much bigger than a 500ml bottle of chocolate milk.\n\nThey needed to spend months in a neonatal intensive care unit after their birth in March 2020, with one staying three months in hospital and the other five months.\n\nIt was an incredibly stressful time, Mahoney told 9news.com.au, with large amounts of her days taken up with just waiting at the hospital to hold her babies.\n\nTwins Angus and Hugh were born 12 weeks early and weighed just 1.1kg. (Supplied: Nicole Mahoney)\n\n\"You were only allowed to hold them once a day, and at times they were too sick, so you couldn't even hold them at all,\" she said.\n\nMahoney, who now lives in Adelaide, was working as a government employee in NSW at the time and had planned to take 12 months maternity leave.\n\nHowever, half of that time was taken up in hospital, Mahoney said, adding that she quickly realised how rigid the federal government's paid parental leave scheme was.\n\n\"From the day that the boys were born, I had to use maternity leave. It had to start then,\" she said.\n\n\"I had 12 weeks of sick leave I accrued, but I couldn't touch that.\n\n\"The frustrating thing is that if they had been born then gone to hospital at day 1 for this amount of time I would have been able to use my sick leave to care for them and be with them, so why not in this circumstance?\"\n\nMahoney said she spent much of the second half of her maternity leave taking the twins to medical appointments and protecting them from getting sick with their fragile immune systems.\n\n\"Even once you were out, you were just forever still at the hospital,\" Mahoney said.\n\n\"They were also really susceptible to catching things.\n\n\"For childcare, they told me don't put them in until they're at least one. Just don't do it, because you're just risking re-hospitalisation.\"\n\nMahoney is one parent joining a campaign from premature babies advocacy group Miracle Babies Foundation, calling on the Albanese government and Opposition to commit to changing the Paid Parental Leave legislation to include extra allowances for parents of premature babies.\n\nTimed to coincide with the lead-up to the federal election, the foundation's campaign is asking for primary carers of premature babies needing specialist care to be given an extra week of extra Parental Leave Pay for every week a baby is in the hospital beyond two weeks, with a maximum of 14 weeks extra pay. For fathers and partners, the foundation is asking for additional two weeks of extra Dad and Partner Pay.\n\nUnder the current legislation, eligible parents receive up to 20 weeks' paid parental leave at the national minimum wage. Working dads and partners receive two weeks' leave paid at the national minimum wage. The scheme will be expanded to 26 weeks by 2026, with four weeks reserved for each parent.\n\nNicole Mahoney's twin boys are now five years old. (Supplied: Nicole Mahoney)\n\nThe campaign follows a parliamentary petition on the same topic lodged by the Miracle Babies Foundation in 2023, which received more than 10,000 signatures.\n\nFollowing the petition, the Australian Public Service Commission enterprise agreement was updated to include additional leave for parents of premature babies, but this only applies to government employees.\n\nMiracle Babies Foundation founder and CEO Kylie Pussell said the current conditions of the parental leave scheme meant some parents of premature babies were coming home from hospital with no leave left.\n\n\"We believe that all babies should be going home from hospital with that same amount of parental leave,\" she said.\n\nPussell said parents and carers of premature babies were already under huge financial strain, with many having paid for months of travel costs to and from the hospital, as well as eating out and accommodation expenses.\n\n\"It's such a difficult time, and then when you get to baby's discharge and you've got no pay parental leave left, we're putting women in such a difficult position of perhaps having to leave the workforce because they have nothing left,\" she said.\n\nPussell said the lack of extra support for parents of premature babies also meant some could be forced to put vulnerable babies into childcare before they were ready.\n\n\"It's putting parents in a really difficult spot,\" she said.\n\nSocial Services minister Amanda Rishworth said she understood the unique challenges faced by families who had experienced the birth of a premature or sick newborn.\n\n\"Over the past three years, the Albanese Labor Government has delivered the biggest expansion to Paid Parental Leave since Labor first introduced the scheme in 2011,\" Rishworth said.\n\n\"Our changes are providing families, including those with a premature or sick baby, with the support they need to manage care of their child in the way that best suits their circumstances.\n\n\"This includes arrangements to enable parents to take time off work together for longer and to provide the additional flexibility that helps families who have a child in hospital.\"\n\nMahoney, whose twin sons are now aged five, said she hoped the government would reconsider their stance and increase the support for parents of premature babies.\n\n\"You'd be providing parents with the opportunity to actually spend that time with their kids that everyone else gets. It's being taken away from them,\" she said.\n\n\"These kids are very vulnerable, so being forced to send them back into childcare early, when they're still very susceptible to getting sick and having serious sicknesses as a result of it, it just puts them at risk.\n\n\"It's stressful to the families, and it also means that women will probably stay out of the workforce longer because you don't feel safe to put your kid into childcare when they've been that sick.\"",

    "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said US President Donald Trump's auto tariffs are a \"direct attack\" on his country and that the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low.\n\nTrump said earlier that he was placing 25 per cent tariffs on auto imports and, to underscore his intention, he stated \"This is permanent\".\n\n\"This is a very direct attack,\" Carney responded.\n\n\"We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country.\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Trump places 25 per cent tariff on imported autos\n\nCanadian PM Mark Carney called Trump's new tax a \"direct attack\" on Canada. (AP)\n\nCarney said he needs to see the details of Trump's executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on US relations.\n\nCarney earlier announced a $2.23 billion \"strategic response fund\" that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump's tariffs.\n\nAutos are Canada's second-largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.\n\n\"Canada will be there for auto workers,\" he said.\n\nTrump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for US auto-makers.\n\nThe president has plunged the US into a global trade war \u2014 all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.\n\nThe Conference Board reported Tuesday that its US consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021.\n\nNew Canadian PM Mark Carney has made opposition to Donald Trump the centrepiece of his campaign. (AP)\n\n\"His trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,\" Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada's April 28 election.\n\nThe tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales.\n\nTrump previously 25 per cent tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products \u2014 as well as all of America's trading partners \u2014 on April 2.\n\n\"He wants to break us so America can own us,\" Carney said. \"And it will never ever happen because we just don't look out for ourselves we look out for each other.\"\n\nCarney, former two-time central banker, made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest US-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25 per cent of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing.\n\nCarney said the bridge carries A$222 billion in goods every year and A$636 billion per day.\n\nDonald Trump has announced a sweeping new tax on imported cars. (AP)\n\n\"Now those numbers and the jobs and the pay cheques that depend on that are in question,\" Carney said. \"The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.\"\n\nIn the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-US border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said, whose province has the bulk of Canada's auto industry, Ford said auto plants on both sides the border will shut simultaneously if the tariffs go ahead.\n\n\"President is calling it Liberation Day. I call it Termination Day for American workers. I know President Trump likes tell people 'Your fired\\!\" I didn't think he meant US auto workers when he said it,\" Ford said.\n\nTrump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbour and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians.\n\nThe new prime minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn't had a phone call with Trump. It is unusual for a US president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.\n\n\"It would be appropriate that the president and I speak given the action that he has taken. I'm sure that will happen soon,\" Carney said.\n\nCrossing the border between Canada and the US is a simple process. (AP)",

(Apple)\n\nAdditionally, where dual names are available they are shown on Apple Maps to all users, for example Sydney Cove will show as \"Sydney Cove/Warrane\".\n\nThese Indigenous place names are also embedded into the Maps database to allow them to be searched by users around the world.\n\nWhile traditional ownership is a well-respected part of our nation and is regularly named in Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement to Country ceremonies across Australia, there is no definitive set of boundaries for these areas.\n\nWorking with Indigenous representatives, and using data published by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) and then combined with information from local language holders, language centres, Aboriginal land trusts, and ranger groups, Apple has been able to place Traditional Owner labels over the broad areas without showing a definitive boundary.\n\nThe man who thinks he's woken up from a coma every 20 seconds View Gallery\n\nIndigenous community leader Charles Prouse, a proud Nyikina man from the Kimberley, Western Australia, has been working with Apple for several years advising on this process and his view on these changes seemed clear to me in a briefing on these new features.\n\nHe was pleased, perhaps glad to simply have his community acknowledged, to know that in the eyes of Apple \u2013 they exist.\n\nFor that alone, it's a big leap forward.\n\nThe maps, associated labels and community-driven information will update over time to provide more knowledge and education to those who seek it.\n\nNo update is required by users of Apple Maps as the map data and these changes are cloud-based.",

(Reuters: Guglielmo Mangiapane)\n\nAnd they will be joined in both movies by Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who is playing Ben Grimm, aka the Thing, and Joseph Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch.\n\nSimu Liu, who played the title character in 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, is also in the newly announced cast, as is Tenoch Huerta Mej\u00eda, who played the aquatic antagonist Namor in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nLetitia Wright, who plays Shuri in the Black Panther films, will also be back among the Avengers, as will other Black Panther alum Winston Duke.\n\nFlorence Pugh, who will reprise her MCU role as Yelena Belova in the forthcoming Thunderbolts, will also appear in Doomsday, along with cast mate David Harbour as Red Guardian.\n\nSome of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's biggest and most anticipated names were not among the 27 names announced, though Marvel and Disney could be sitting on them for now.\n\nThere was no mention of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine or Ryan Reynolds's Deadpool, though the announcement did include Channing Tatum, who played the X-Men's Gambit in last year's Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nChris Evans was also absent from the cast list. Tom Holland's name did not appear either.\n\nHolland's Spider-Man became an Avenger in previous films. However, the character was on loan from owner Sony, whose complicated relationship with Marvel has made the intellectual property a sticking point.\n\nIron Man actor Robert Downey Jr announced he was returning to Marvel Cinematic Universe during the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con. (Getty Images: Matt Winkelmeyer)\n\nRobert Downey Jr revealed last summer that he will be returning to the MCU to play the villain Doctor Doom in the next set of Avengers films.\n\nAvengers: Doomsday, set for release in May 2026, will be the fifth Avengers movie, and the first since 2019's Avengers Endgame became one of the highest-grossing films of all time.\n\nMoment of truth for Marvel\n\nMarvel has been struggling to recover its cultural buzz and box office mojo ever since Endgame. However, it hopes the forthcoming ensemble films will bring back the magic that dominated cinema for more than a decade.\n\nWill Deadpool save the day?

While you could argue the Marvel Cinematic Universe is far from on its knees, all eyes are on the lone MCU film being released this year to save the day, or \u2014 at the very least \u2014 be a canary in the caped coal mine.\n\nThe success of the first 23 films in the franchise \u2014 the Infinity Saga \u2014 has been difficult to emulate, with the so-called Multiverse Saga seeing the first box office flops in the studio's history: 2021's Eternals and 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\n\nBoth films also copped \"rotten\" critic scores on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, another first for the MCU.\n\nDespite decent reviews, 2023's The Marvels was the MCU's lowest-grossing film ever, failing to break even on its more than $US300 million ($476.4 million) budget.\n\nThe television offerings have also been mixed at best, with shows such as Loki and WandaVision earning good numbers and critical acclaim, and outings such as Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Secret Invasion struggling to make an impact.\n\nIt has not been all bad news, though, with 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home delivering a huge fan service and generating almost U$2 billion in gross worldwide revenue for Marvel \u2014 unsurprising for a character considered to be the heart of Marvel.\n\n2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home was a massive box office hit for Marvel Studios. (Supplied: Sony Pictures)\n\nAvengers: Doomsday and the follow-up Avengers: Secret Wars will bring to a close to the Multiverse Saga after a bumpy ride in which the studio that seemed like it could do no wrong faced the realities of a growing franchise.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the upcoming Avengers movies can right the ship for Marvel, but the star power of the cast cannot hurt.",

We had to work really hard and if we didn't prepare really well for that game England would have won.\"\n\nMeanwhile, England coach Shaun Wane said he hoped the famous Headingley Stadium in Leeds would give his country an advantage if the series went to a decider.\n\nIconic England stadium Wembley will host the first test, before the tour moves to the north of the country.\n\nThe new Everton Stadium in Liverpool will host the second Test, before moving east to Yorkshire for the final Test at Headingley in Leeds.\n\nHeadingley has been a happy hunting ground for England in recent years, with a 34-16 win over Samoa in 2024, and a 26-4 triumph in 2023 against Tonga.\n\nShould the Ashes be level heading into the third Test, Wane said he would be very pleased to play a decider in Leeds.\n\n\"We played the second Test against Samoa, third Test against Tonga at Headingley. We were there last Saturday with the Wigan team. The atmosphere \u2026 is second to none. The pitch is great,\" Wane, who is also a managing director for Super League side Wigan, said.\n\n\"How they looked after my team for that second and third Tests was impeccable.

(Supplied: Sharky Aerials)\n\nFound in waters between Tasmania and Western Australia, Australian salmon grow up to a metre long and are prized by local fishers.\n\nThe salmon migrate along the south coast in autumn before spawning eggs between Cape Leeuwin and Rottnest Island.\n\nThe fish larvae is then carried on the Leeuwin current back down the coast and as far as South Australia and Victoria.\n\nThe sightings of the schools draws hundreds to WA's southern coast each year.\n\nWA fishing writer Scott Coghlan said the easy access to the fish, which is known to school in ankle deep water, is part of its popularity.\n\n\"They're a fish anyone can catch,\" he said.\n\n\"Anyone from the best angler to the worst angler can grab a salmon when they're around.\"\n\nFishing expert Scott Coghlan said salmon season is a highlight of the year for fishers of all skill levels.

(ABC News)\n\nFish numbers are carefully monitored each year, but Department of Primary Industries spokesman Aaron Moses said they remained healthy.\n\n\"The amount of salmon stocks we see each year does vary year to year,\" Mr Moses said.\n\n\"The stocks of Western Australian salmon are sustainable.\"\n\nMr Moses said it was a good sign for the species when more fish were spotted and caught.\n\n\"It's always good to see big schools of fish move through along the south coast and west coast,\" he said.",

Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\nBut while they created a stream of half-chances, there were few clear ones in the opening half.\n\nThe quarterfinal turned on either side of the break.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, a double-save by Arsenal goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar, from Filippa Angeldahl and Linda Caicedo, stopped Arsenal from conceding what would have been a devastating third goal in the tie.\n\nReprieved, Arsenal took full advantage. Within 4 minutes of the restart, they were level on aggregate. Inside the first minute, Foord drove cross-field, surging past tacklers, before feeding Kelly whose superb cross was turned in by Russo.\n\nAs Madrid reeled, Kelly crossed again and Mariona Caldentey's header squirmed under the diving Real keeper Misa.\n\nThen, just before the hour, Catley challenged for a Katie McCabe free-kick and the ball fell to Russo, who hooked in. Arsenal were ahead.\n\nThe England centre-forward subsequently had two more goals fractionally ruled out for offside, setting up a frantic finish in which Van Domselaar again denied Caicido, and Foord twice went close to settling Arsenal nerves, before they could finally celebrate.\n\nThere was less excitement in France even after eight-time winners Lyon went behind when Klara Buhl halved the 2-0 first-leg deficit after 33 minutes.\n\nBut less than 30 seconds after the interval, Melchie Dumornay restored the advantage.\n\nGoals from Kadidiatou Diani and Tabitha Chawinga effectively made the tie safe by the hour mark.\n\nAda Hegerberg added a fourth in added time.\n\nThe remaining quarterfinal, also on Thursday night, local time, has holders Barcelona defending a 4-1 lead at home to Wolfsburg.\n\nThe winners will play Chelsea or City in the semifinals in a month's time, with Kerr hoping to have finally recovered from her ACL injury should Chelsea get there.\n\nAAP\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

(Flickr: Lock the Gate Alliance)\n\nThe mine, which produces thermal coal to generate electricity, has a 14-year life estimate with current permits until 2028 when a new lease is required.\n\nThe Queensland Land Court handed down its recommendation last week that the thermal coal mine's lease should not continue unless it could prove it was cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe final decision on whether to approve the lease now sits with Mines and Resources Minister Dale Last who is \"carefully considering\" the case.\n\nA reclaimer scoops up coal from stockpiles sent to ships via the Port Waratah coal loaders at the Port of Newcastle.

(Supplied: Queensland Resources Council)\n\n\"Duplicative approvals processes add delays and opens up mining applications and amendments to activist lawfare,\" Ms Hewson said.\n\nIn making its decision the Land Court considered three objections.\n\nMs Hewson said the objectors were not nearby landholders and did not submit evidence or physically attend the hearing in Brisbane.\n\nCoral Rowston from the not-for-profit group Environmental Advocacy in Central Queensland was one of the objectors and welcomed the outcome.\n\nDr Coral Rowston said proponents must take climate change seriously because courts do. (Supplied: Coral Rowston)\n\n\"Thermal coal is being phased out so creating tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions is not in central Queensland's best interests,\" Dr Rowston said.\n\n\"Our environment and the communities that live here are far more important than one company creating a lot of profit.\n\n\"I think it's a very strong sign that proponents must take climate change seriously, because the court certainly does.\"",

Among all the other notches on his CV \u2013 senior chef de partie at Attica, sous chef at Melbourne\u2019s Stokehouse, head chef at Raes on Wategos, executive chef at Paper Daisy, and now executive chef at Supernormal and Bar Miette \u2013 it\u2019s easy to forget Barratt helped create Hector\u2019s Deli. Bar Miette\u2019s muffuletta sandwich. Morgan Roberts Yeah, that Hector\u2019s Deli. The sandwich shop in Richmond (and then Fitzroy, South Melbourne and Melbourne\u2019s CBD) that murders every lunchtime, with queues snaking out the door. It was a major player in turning a nascent Australian interest in fancy sangers into a full-blown national craze. It perhaps wasn\u2019t a surprise, then, when sandwiches and variations thereof started showing up on the menu at Bar Miette. There\u2019s a milk bun mortadella stack that comes with salted butter and smoked maple syrup. It\u2019s perennial. And then there\u2019s a bunch of toasties and fresh sandwiches that Barratt updates semi-frequently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExclusive Shane Delia\u2019s Layla wows with a new take on Middle Eastern food The star of the show, though, is his take on a classic muffuletta sandwich. But, wait, first let\u2019s talk about the Godmother The muffuletta sandwich is one of New Orleans\u2019 most iconic eats \u2013 a dead-simple combo of house-made olive salad combined with layers of Italian coldcuts that, when made properly, adds up to something much greater than the sum of its parts. But Barratt\u2019s inspiration for his muffuletta actually comes from Los Angeles. Specifically, the Godmother sandwich from Bay Cities Italian Deli & Bakery in Santa Monica.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Barratt\u2019s muffuletta is in part inspired by a Los Angeles-sandiwch he first tried in his Hector\u2019s Deli days. Morgan Roberts \u201cI\u2019ve always remembered it,\u201d Barratt says. \u201cBack in the Hector\u2019s days we were R&Ding through the roof, and out of all the sandwiches that we tried, that one really stuck with me.\u201d The Godmother is a bunch of Italian meats (Genoa salami, mortadella, capicola, ham and prosciutto) slapped together with provolone, onion, pickles, lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickled peppers, mustard and a house-made Italian dressing, served between two slices of crusty bread that Bay Cities bakes continuously throughout the day. Bar Miette\u2019s muffuletta sandwich Bar Miette doesn\u2019t have the capacity to make its bread in-house but Barratt has the next best thing: a ciabatta loaf delivered daily from Agnes Bakery (Agnes also makes those luscious-looking pastries you\u2019ll find at the end of the Bar Miette counter).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s arguably what lifts this sanger from tasty curio into something truly memorable. We\u2019ve eaten the muffuletta a bunch of times since it first appeared on the Bar Miette menu in November, and it keeps getting better and better. You suspect it\u2019s because Barratt has finally found a bread with which he\u2019s truly chuffed. \u201cFor me, sandwiches are always about the bread first,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing back to Hector\u2019s, you can use any ingredients you like, but if the bread\u2019s shit it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s the right bread that really makes the sandwich.\u201d If nothing else, a robust, crunchy bread can stand up to a key step in preparing a traditional muffuletta: the wrap. Barratt wraps his in brown sandwich paper \u2013 \u201cnice and tight\u201d, he says \u2013 for 40 minutes before slicing it into portions for service. So, what else is Barratt stuffing in there before he wraps the thing? Mortadella, and hot and mild salami cotto from LP\u2019s Quality Meats, chopped Byron Bay Co Sicilian olives, red onion, whatever ruddy Australian tomatoes that might be in season, and provolone cheese. Coldcuts from LP\u2019s Quality Meats and bread from Agnes Bakery are key elements in Bar Miette\u2019s muffuletta. Morgan Roberts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other clever touch Barratt has borrowed from the Godmother: stacking the ingredients equally top and bottom around the onion and tomato so you can simply peel it open and share with a dining partner along with another sandwich, or something else from the Bar Miette menu. You might be losing a bit of decadence eating it this way but the filling is so generous you\u2019ll hardly care. To eat, it\u2019s a thing of simple beauty: Agnes\u2019 ciabatta is robust and crunchy, and been given a thick smear of salted butter on both sides to help protect it during the wrapping process. The \u2018Reuben\u2019 that\u2019s not a Reuben, but you need to eat ASAP anyway The combination of the umami-packed salami and mortadella, the briny tang of the olives and the sweetness of the tomato, all brought together by the wrapping process, make it a joy to eat \u2013 particularly on a warmer day sitting on Bar Miette\u2019s fabulous terrace with its eye-popping views of the Story Bridge. \u201cSandwiches get overlooked. Everyone thinks they\u2019re really simple because you can grab them on every corner,\u201d Barratt says. \u201cBut you\u2019re creating something with premium ingredients, so you need to treat those ingredients with respect to create something special. I\u2019m really happy with how it\u2019s come together.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere can you get it Bar Miette\u2019s muffuletta sandwich is $21.

    "text": "One of Trump\u2019s top economic advisers has written a 41-page document that lays out the possibility of achieving just such an agreement, through a combination of tariffs and other policies. Now, foreign bankers, Wall Street traders and congressional aides alike are reading it in search of clues. Written by Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, \u201cA User\u2019s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System\u201d has emerged as what many observers hope is a blueprint for trying to understand the administration\u2019s erratic economic policy.\n\nRoughly 80 years later, President Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic trade policies have fuelled speculation among investors and economists that a modern-day equivalent may be on the horizon - a \u201cMar-a-Lago accord\u201d to revise those postwar global trade rules, crafted at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIn July 1944, during World War II, hundreds of economic policymakers from dozens of countries gathered at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to establish a new framework for the global financial system once the war ended. The resulting Bretton Woods agreement has shaped international trade ever since.\n\nMiran\u2019s paper argues that unilateral tariffs may be necessary to force US trading partners to make changes. He writes that the dollar\u2019s strength for the past half-century has made US exports too expensive for the rest of the world to buy, and imports too cheap for US consumers to pass up, degrading US manufacturing and industrial output. Trump, Miran suggests, could try to force scores of countries to increase the value of their currencies \u2013 possibly through a US-launched trade war that puts unrelenting economic pressure on the rest of the world. (Miran describes the idea only as one of a handful of options, rather than a definitive set of recommendations.)\n\nLoading\n\nFor now, there is no indication the White House is moving forward with a Mar-a-Lago accord. Trump has discussed his upcoming set of tariffs as aimed at getting other countries to lower their own import taxes, and Miran said in an interview that a global currency agreement is not what the administration is pursuing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said publicly that he thinks the US dollar should be strong, whereas the ideas Miran outlines would require the dollar to be weaker than other countries\u2019 currencies.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s very clear on fair and reciprocal tariffs,\u201d Miran told The Washington Post. \u201cAnyone thinking what I wrote in November is the policy agenda we\u2019re secretly implementing right now is just looking for something to write about.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the paper has attracted a great deal of interest from economists and other observers at home and abroad who are trying to understand the pain inflicted by the tariffs as part of a broader vision. Some Wall Street analysts have pointed out that even if Trump\u2019s aides are not moving forward with a Mar-a-Lago accord now, the administration could seek a currency agreement later. Trump\u2019s goal to revive domestic manufacturing might be impossible just by having other countries lower their tariffs on US exports, raising the possibility that Miran\u2019s broader program reemerges down the line. And while there are no signs of a global currency agreement, Trump\u2019s aides are saying publicly that they are targeting countries they think have artificially devalued their currencies \u2013 reflecting one of the core ideas in Miran\u2019s paper.",

    "text": "A Coalition government would dump tax cuts in favour of a temporary cut to the fuel excise in a move it says would save families hundreds of dollars, but critics have labelled it a \"sugar hit\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal would halve the fuel excise for 12 months , lowering the rate on petrol and diesel from about 50 cents to 25 cents per litre. Opposition leader Peter Dutton is set to formally announce the plan in his budget reply on Thursday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced a $17 billion two-phase tax cut plan when handing down the federal government's budget on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan passed the Senate on Wednesday night and will save taxpayers up to $268 on their tax bills \u2014 about $5 a week \u2014 in 2026/27 and up to $536 every year after.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition voted against the bill, and Opposition treasury spokesperson Angus Taylor confirmed on Thursday it would replace the tax cuts with its temporary fuel excise cut.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Revealed: The winners and losers of the 2025 federal budget\n\nTaylor told ABC News Breakfast the move was \"temporary, targeted, responsible, and it's focused on that group that we think are under the most pressure\" amid the cost of living woes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the plan would save a one-car family about $750 a year \u2014 or $14 a week \u2014 and a two-car family about $1,500 a year \u2014 or $28 a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan is expected to cost $6 billion a year. Asked how the Coalition would pay for it, Taylor said it would cost less than Labor's tax cuts and the Coalition would \"put our costings out before the election\".\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton told Nine's Today program the plan would start \"straight away\" and insisted it would not add to inflationary pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Dutton of copying the former Liberal government's 2022 fuel excise cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is what Scott Morrison did in the 2022 budget but then it disappeared because it was time-limited,\" he told ABC radio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is time-limited as well \u2014 just for one year, no ongoing cost of living help.\"\n\n\n\nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young labelled the plan to cut the fuel excise a \"sugar hit\" which would \"not touch the sides of the permanent cost of living relief that Australians really need\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cutting petrol excise for 12 months might get Peter Dutton a headline but sure as hell won't get him a budget for the long-term that helps people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor didn't rule out larger tax cuts but the Opposition has so far remained tight-lipped on tax relief or economic policy it will offer voters at the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition has also pledged to fast-track gas approvals and extend ageing coal-fired power plants to reduce electricity prices in the medium term, a proposal that has been criticised by environmental groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation is increasing that Albanese will call the election as early as Friday, triggering the start of a minimum 33-day campaign that will end with voters going to the polls in May.\n\n\n\n",

What we saw were border closures, and then, when they opened, of course, we saw a short-term increase. But we need to make sure that we manage these issues appropriately, and that's what my government is doing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinians in northern Gaza have protested against Hamas, demanding an end to the war with Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Gaza has been one of the most affected areas of Gaza since Israel responded to the Hamas raid on southern Israel in October 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost buildings in the densely populated area have been reduced to rubble and much of the population has moved several times to escape the conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters chanted anti-Hamas slogans and held signs demanding Hamas end the war and displacement.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne protester, physician Mahmoud Alhaj Ahmed, said he wanted an end to the war and believes a non-partisan interim committee should be governing the strip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur message that we want to deliver, first to the Israeli occupation, stop the war, stop the bloodshed that is happening, we can\u2019t tolerate any more. The second message is to Hamas, the government of Hamas - brothers, we\u2019ve had enough, I swear to God, we\u2019re tired, there\u2019s nothing. There no house to stay, no food, no salary, no family members remaining, I have become disabled. Up until this point, it\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Adam Bandt says his party will support the Albanese government's latest tax cuts, but calls them a massive missed opportunity to get corporations and billionaires to pay their fair share.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the government should have used the opportunity to force tax-dodging corporations to pay up, so the funds could be used to boost mental health resourcing and extend Medicare coverage to dental services.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Bandt says the federal government's cost-of-living solutions fall short of the level of action needed to properly address the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This tiny tax tweak budget is a massive missed opportunity for real cost of living relief like getting dental into Medicare. 73 cents a day in 15 months\u2019 time won\u2019t help that much when rent has gone up hundreds of dollars already.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, Melbourne City has extended their record-breaking undefeated streak in the A-League women's competition to twenty matches, with a four goals to nil win over Brisbane Roar.\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler Otto, Holly McNamara, Bryleeh Henry, and Mariana Speckmaier were the goal scorers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcNamara now has eleven goals this season, second only to Emily Gielnik.\n\n\n\n",

That increases in the second year to deliver an average of $10 a week back to workers, costing $17.1 billion in revenue over three years from 2026-27.\n\n\n\nAccording to estimates from the Coalition, their proposal would reduce fuel costs by approximately $14 per week, with the savings doubling for two-car households. The measure would apply to all drivers, not just wage earners, and would start immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton spent the budget hangover day trying to pick apart the government's centrepiece policy as a \"cruel hoax\", refusing to back the bills as Labor put them straight to the parliament and the treasurer promoted his \"modest\" tax cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing on previous Liberal governments' fuel excise cuts, this new policy would be temporary and reduce excise revenue by $6 billion over 12 months.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Revealed: The winners and losers of the 2025 federal budget\n\nTonight's budget reply from Dutton is also expected to reveal the size of the cut to the migration program.\n\n\n\n\n\nA significant reduction has been foreshadowed by the Opposition, though Opposition treasury spokesperson Angus Taylor has recently declined to repeat a statement he made last year that the Coalition would cut net overseas migration by 25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nA gas reservation policy and a housing pitch may also be on the cards.\n\n\n\n",

Not enough to make any real changes for small business or for families.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNikki says the costs facing Monarch Cakes are closer to home for most people than the problems for many small businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says increasing power prices have hit hard for business like hers that need to run things like ovens and cool rooms constantly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the egg price increase many have noticed at the supermarket recently?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you make cakes for a living, that is also a negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our butter and our eggs are our most-used ingredients, and they are going up every single week. And it's impossible to keep raising the prices, because people don't have any money. You can raise the price, but then, you are going to lose customers. What do you do? You just make less money. You just work for nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company, founded by Polish immigrants, is one of 2.5 million small businesses in Australia which makes up more than 98 per cent of all the companies in the country, employing more than five million people.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall business advocacy group COSBOA says the budget comes at a time when the sector is under pressure, with decade-high insolvencies and crippling costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive Luke Achterstraat says small business is the heart of the Australian economy - and current problems make it all the more important that the sector gets more help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government, trying to deal with the cost of living crisis... it really does beggar belief that there wasn't more support for small business, during a really challenging operating environment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal budget has included two key measures for businesses in Australia: the first, a promise to remove non-compete clauses for workers earning less than $175,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder existing rules, businesses can stop or restrict workers from moving to a competing employer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's also an instant asset write-off scheme, which has been enhanced to allow eligible businesses - that is, those with turnover of less than 10 million dollars per year - to immediately deduct the cost of assets up to 20,000 dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe limit had previously been just 1,000 dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the measure is due to end on the 30th of June, and there was no mention of extending this measure in the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Senator David Pocock says that's poor from both major parties, and shows a bias towards big business over small business.\n\n\n\n",

Source: SBS News On Wednesday, Nine Newspapers reported that some among the group with less financial resources had their travel costs to Canberra covered by the Labor Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nFerguson, who runs the news commentary platform Cheek Media with 158,000 Instagram followers, said Gallagher's office extended the invitation to the lock-up, but she paid for her travel costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The opportunity was given to me, and I absolutely ran at it,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was like: 'of course I'll be there. I'll drive myself down, I'll book my accommodation, I'll get it sorted' because I think the expectation is it's a place for traditional legacy media, and not for newcomers, who are entering the space and trying to change what the Australian media landscape looks like.\"\n\n\n\nBenjamin told SBS: \"ALP (Australian Labor Party) paid for flights and accommodation \u2014 they haven't paid us to create any content \u2014 that's on our own accord.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about influencers having some of their costs covered, independent senator Jacqui Lambie said engaging the next generation with politics was a \"good thing\" for the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Using someone to sell your policy, that's what that's all about, marketing,\" she told reporters in Parliament House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I certainly can't stand here and criticise those influencers, as long as they're reporting properly. If the influencers do the right thing and ... make sure what they're reporting is true and correct... and it's not about them and it's about what's best for the country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has sought comment from some of the other content creators if their travel costs were covered.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Labor Party confirmed on Wednesday it covered the costs of some content creators it invited to the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ALP has an ongoing engagement program with content creators,\" a statement from the party read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The party has provided logistical support to some content creators in order to make travel to Canberra for budget week accessible.

Measures that were opposed by the Opposition. They want to cut everything: cut your education, cut your health. The only thing they don\u2019t want to cut is your taxes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal election date has yet to be formally announced, but must be held by May 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump says his administration will look into the use of social media app Signal by White House officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after revelations that Mr Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, added a journalist to a Signal group chat where officials discussed plans for military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President J-D Vance and other senior security officials were also in the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe journalist added to the group chat, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, did not reveal details of the strike at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, President Trump defended Mr Waltz, while appearing to insult Mr Goldberg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The attack was totally successful. It was, I guess, from what I understand, took place during that it wasn't classified information. So this was not less of a now it's classified information. It's probably a little bit different. But I always say you get you have to learn from every experience. I think it was very unfair the way they attacked Michael. He's a good person. The person that was on it just happens to be a sleazebag.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creator of a new documentary on the future of the National Rugby League says the rise of women in the game is a positive development.\n\n\n\n\n\nGamilaroi and Dunghutti woman Marlee Silva is the host, writer and executive producer behind the documentary Skin in the Game , which considers issues around gender and violence in and out of the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first-time documentary filmmaker says the project was initially inspired by her childhood as the daughter of Indigenous rugby league legend Rod \"Rocket\" Silva, who played for the Bulldogs and Roosters.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told NITV Radio, the project then took on a life of its own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over the last well couple of years, but a real explosion over the last year, with the horrific epidemic of gendered violence and women dying at the hands of their partners. We know that rugby league sometimes has been associated with the problem when it comes to gendered violence. But I also know because of what my dad has experienced and what I get to see as a rugby league reporter on the sidelines - is this game has the great opportunity to do good. And to create the change that we need to see.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin in the Game premiered on NITV over the weekend - and is now available to view on SBS On Demand with subtitles in Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese.\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nA new stadium is set to be built in Victoria Park for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement by Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli goes against an election pledge he made last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the private sector will build the entertainment hub project at an old industrial site next to the Brisbane Cricket Ground, also called the Gabba.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premier says there was not enough time to upgrade the Gabba before the Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It became a choice between spending billions on temporary facilties and temporary stands that delivered no legacy or securing the future of AFL and cricket at a new home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, Australia is a step closer to qualification for 2026 World Cup, after a 2-nil win against China.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoals from Jackson Irvine and Nishan Velupillay helped to secure the result.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe win over China has meant Australia, retains the second automatic qualification spot in Group C.\n\n\n\n\n\nSocceroos coach Tony Popovic says attention now turns to the upcoming games against Japan and Saudi Arabia in June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were in front when we started the window; and can we stay there at the end of the window. So we did our part, we got six points. We extended our lead to three. So we're in a good position. It is in our hands, but we have to get the job done. Wonderful two games coming up. First to Japan in Perth. It will be a special match and we're looking forward to that.\"\n\n\n\n",

That wasn\u2019t a huge mistake....\n\n\n\n\n\nRATCLIFFE: \"This is an embarrassment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration's group chat scandal has been laid bare before a Senate committee.\n\n\n\n\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe has been among those in the line of fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nMICHAEL BENNETT: \"Do you think that it's perfectly appropriate that there was a reporter added, especially one that the Secretary of Defense says is 'deceitful, highly discredited, a so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes over and over again'. Do you, is your testimony that it was appropriate that he was added to this Signal thread?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN RATCLIFFE: \"No, of course not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBENNETT: \"And why, why did you not call, you are the CIA...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRATCLIFFE: \"You are mischaracterising my testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss a sensitive operation has exposed the Trump Administration to blistering criticism from Democratic politicians.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an article posted on Monday by The Atlantic, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz appeared to have mistakenly added the magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the chat that included 18 senior administration officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them: US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article alleges group members were discussing plans for a military strike against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, hours before it took place on the 15th of March.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's said to include precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing, but The Atlantic did not publish those details.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, U- President Donald Trump says the backlash faced by Mr Waltz is unfair, instead slighting the journalist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I always say you have to learn from every experience. I think it was very unfair the way they attacked Michael, he's a good person. The person that was on just happens to be a sleazebag, so maybe that's just coincidence I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Waltz has also piled on criticism, claiming people are working against the administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a lot of journalists in this city that've made big names for themselves making up lies about this president. Whether it's the Russia hoax or making up lies about Gold Star families, and this one in particular I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we are and we are looking into reviewing how the heck he got into this room.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Administration officials told the committee no classified information was included in the texts about US attack plans in the message chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat claim has bewildered Democrats and former U-S officials, who regard that kind of targeting information as some of the most closely-held material ahead of a military campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen pressed, the officials struggled to explain why the publicly available app was used to discuss such a delicate matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard taking one approach...\n\n\n\n\n\nMARK KELLY: \"Would you consider that classified information? I'm not talking about what happened this week.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTULSI GABBARD: \"There are other factors that would go into determining that classification.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n...and Mr Ratcliffe taking another.\n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN RATCLIFFE: \"Pre-decisional strike deliberation should be conducted through classified channels.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMARK KELLY: \"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut both equally deflected blame \u2013 shifting the spotlight back to Defence Secretary Hegseth, who Mr Goldberg alleges posted the war plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, has called on Mr Hegseth to resign. \" For the defence secretary to coordinate war plans in such a haphazard and dangerous way puts our national security, our troops, and every single American at risk. This is the man leading our troops into battle and is meant to protect Americans and our national security at all costs. The Senate, as well as all relevant authorities within the executive branch, must investigate this incident fully. Fully.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile repeating the insistence that no classified information was shared in the group, Mr Trump says United States national security remains watertight, but added if he had his way, such information would be conveyed in a room with solid lead walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have an amazing group. Our national security now is stronger than it's ever been. We have had a very, very successful numerous attacks in that area. These are people that shoot down ships. Not only our ships, ships all over the world, they're shooting down right out of the water and damaging them badly, or they're going down. They're also shooting anything that happens to be flying in the area. We hit them very, very hard. There was no classified information as I understand it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is not convinced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So you're talking about the highest levels of government with the exception of the president of the United States. It's his whole national security team. If they're doing this on this day, I can't imagine that the first time they do this, they accidentally add the editor for The Atlantic. This was probably over the last 60 days, a regular practice. And who else knows what is out there, what has been shared and with what individuals?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither is Republican Senator, Tim Cotton, who's thrown doubt over whether US intelligence agencies are doing their job.\n\n\n\n",

Among all the other notches on his CV \u2013 senior chef de partie at Attica, sous chef at Melbourne\u2019s Stokehouse, head chef at Raes on Wategos, executive chef at Paper Daisy, and now executive chef at Supernormal and Bar Miette \u2013 it\u2019s easy to forget Barratt helped create Hector\u2019s Deli. Bar Miette\u2019s muffuletta sandwich. Morgan Roberts Yeah, that Hector\u2019s Deli. The sandwich shop in Richmond (and then Fitzroy, South Melbourne and Melbourne\u2019s CBD) that murders every lunchtime, with queues snaking out the door. It was a major player in turning a nascent Australian interest in fancy sangers into a full-blown national craze. It perhaps wasn\u2019t a surprise, then, when sandwiches and variations thereof started showing up on the menu at Bar Miette. There\u2019s a milk bun mortadella stack that comes with salted butter and smoked maple syrup. It\u2019s perennial. And then there\u2019s a bunch of toasties and fresh sandwiches that Barratt updates semi-frequently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExclusive Shane Delia\u2019s Layla wows with a new take on Middle Eastern food The star of the show, though, is his take on a classic muffuletta sandwich. But, wait, first let\u2019s talk about the Godmother The muffuletta sandwich is one of New Orleans\u2019 most iconic eats \u2013 a dead-simple combo of house-made olive salad combined with layers of Italian coldcuts that, when made properly, adds up to something much greater than the sum of its parts. But Barratt\u2019s inspiration for his muffuletta actually comes from Los Angeles. Specifically, the Godmother sandwich from Bay Cities Italian Deli & Bakery in Santa Monica.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Barratt\u2019s muffuletta is in part inspired by a Los Angeles-sandiwch he first tried in his Hector\u2019s Deli days. Morgan Roberts \u201cI\u2019ve always remembered it,\u201d Barratt says. \u201cBack in the Hector\u2019s days we were R&Ding through the roof, and out of all the sandwiches that we tried, that one really stuck with me.\u201d The Godmother is a bunch of Italian meats (Genoa salami, mortadella, capicola, ham and prosciutto) slapped together with provolone, onion, pickles, lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickled peppers, mustard and a house-made Italian dressing, served between two slices of crusty bread that Bay Cities bakes continuously throughout the day. Bar Miette\u2019s muffuletta sandwich Bar Miette doesn\u2019t have the capacity to make its bread in-house but Barratt has the next best thing: a ciabatta loaf delivered daily from Agnes Bakery (Agnes also makes those luscious-looking pastries you\u2019ll find at the end of the Bar Miette counter).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s arguably what lifts this sanger from tasty curio into something truly memorable. We\u2019ve eaten the muffuletta a bunch of times since it first appeared on the Bar Miette menu in November, and it keeps getting better and better. You suspect it\u2019s because Barratt has finally found a bread with which he\u2019s truly chuffed. \u201cFor me, sandwiches are always about the bread first,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing back to Hector\u2019s, you can use any ingredients you like, but if the bread\u2019s shit it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s the right bread that really makes the sandwich.\u201d If nothing else, a robust, crunchy bread can stand up to a key step in preparing a traditional muffuletta: the wrap. Barratt wraps his in brown sandwich paper \u2013 \u201cnice and tight\u201d, he says \u2013 for 40 minutes before slicing it into portions for service. So, what else is Barratt stuffing in there before he wraps the thing? Mortadella, and hot and mild salami cotto from LP\u2019s Quality Meats, chopped Byron Bay Co Sicilian olives, red onion, whatever ruddy Australian tomatoes that might be in season, and provolone cheese. Coldcuts from LP\u2019s Quality Meats and bread from Agnes Bakery are key elements in Bar Miette\u2019s muffuletta. Morgan Roberts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other clever touch Barratt has borrowed from the Godmother: stacking the ingredients equally top and bottom around the onion and tomato so you can simply peel it open and share with a dining partner along with another sandwich, or something else from the Bar Miette menu. You might be losing a bit of decadence eating it this way but the filling is so generous you\u2019ll hardly care. To eat, it\u2019s a thing of simple beauty: Agnes\u2019 ciabatta is robust and crunchy, and been given a thick smear of salted butter on both sides to help protect it during the wrapping process. The \u2018Reuben\u2019 that\u2019s not a Reuben, but you need to eat ASAP anyway The combination of the umami-packed salami and mortadella, the briny tang of the olives and the sweetness of the tomato, all brought together by the wrapping process, make it a joy to eat \u2013 particularly on a warmer day sitting on Bar Miette\u2019s fabulous terrace with its eye-popping views of the Story Bridge. \u201cSandwiches get overlooked. Everyone thinks they\u2019re really simple because you can grab them on every corner,\u201d Barratt says. \u201cBut you\u2019re creating something with premium ingredients, so you need to treat those ingredients with respect to create something special. I\u2019m really happy with how it\u2019s come together.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere can you get it Bar Miette\u2019s muffuletta sandwich is $21. You can get one at 443 Queen Street, Brisbane.\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox. Sign up",

    "text": "One of Trump\u2019s top economic advisers has written a 41-page document that lays out the possibility of achieving just such an agreement, through a combination of tariffs and other policies. Now, foreign bankers, Wall Street traders and congressional aides alike are reading it in search of clues. Written by Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, \u201cA User\u2019s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System\u201d has emerged as what many observers hope is a blueprint for trying to understand the administration\u2019s erratic economic policy.\n\nRoughly 80 years later, President Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic trade policies have fuelled speculation among investors and economists that a modern-day equivalent may be on the horizon - a \u201cMar-a-Lago accord\u201d to revise those postwar global trade rules, crafted at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIn July 1944, during World War II, hundreds of economic policymakers from dozens of countries gathered at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to establish a new framework for the global financial system once the war ended. The resulting Bretton Woods agreement has shaped international trade ever since.\n\nMiran\u2019s paper argues that unilateral tariffs may be necessary to force US trading partners to make changes. He writes that the dollar\u2019s strength for the past half-century has made US exports too expensive for the rest of the world to buy, and imports too cheap for US consumers to pass up, degrading US manufacturing and industrial output. Trump, Miran suggests, could try to force scores of countries to increase the value of their currencies \u2013 possibly through a US-launched trade war that puts unrelenting economic pressure on the rest of the world. (Miran describes the idea only as one of a handful of options, rather than a definitive set of recommendations.)\n\nLoading\n\nFor now, there is no indication the White House is moving forward with a Mar-a-Lago accord. Trump has discussed his upcoming set of tariffs as aimed at getting other countries to lower their own import taxes, and Miran said in an interview that a global currency agreement is not what the administration is pursuing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said publicly that he thinks the US dollar should be strong, whereas the ideas Miran outlines would require the dollar to be weaker than other countries\u2019 currencies.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s very clear on fair and reciprocal tariffs,\u201d Miran told The Washington Post. \u201cAnyone thinking what I wrote in November is the policy agenda we\u2019re secretly implementing right now is just looking for something to write about.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the paper has attracted a great deal of interest from economists and other observers at home and abroad who are trying to understand the pain inflicted by the tariffs as part of a broader vision. Some Wall Street analysts have pointed out that even if Trump\u2019s aides are not moving forward with a Mar-a-Lago accord now, the administration could seek a currency agreement later. Trump\u2019s goal to revive domestic manufacturing might be impossible just by having other countries lower their tariffs on US exports, raising the possibility that Miran\u2019s broader program reemerges down the line. And while there are no signs of a global currency agreement, Trump\u2019s aides are saying publicly that they are targeting countries they think have artificially devalued their currencies \u2013 reflecting one of the core ideas in Miran\u2019s paper.",

    "text": "FOGO bins have had a mixed response in many parts of Australia, but environmentalists say it's the only way to tackle our landfill crisis quietly playing out.\n\nAll households in Perth will have FOGO bins by the end of this year. Source: Supplied/CityofPortPhillip\n\nFOGO bins have become a widely debated waste management strategy, with councils across Australia adopting them to ease pressure on landfill. But despite pushback from some residents, environmentalists argue their benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nNow implemented in dozens of local government areas nationwide, Perth is set to roll out FOGO bins to every household by the end of the year. In some regions, this shift has led to red-lidded general waste bins being collected fortnightly instead of weekly \u2014 a change that has sparked concern among residents, particularly those in larger households, over potential odours from accumulating waste.\n\nConcern bubbled up this week when the City of Rockingham announced plans to move to fortnightly red bin collections in June, prompting pushback from some community members worried about hygiene and practicality.\n\nMeanwhile, Kwinana\u2019s new three-bin system, set to launch in late April, which will introduce a green-lid bin for organic waste such as grass clippings and weeds. However, this change comes with a caveat \u2014 a significantly smaller red bin for general waste.\n\nSome resident will need to make do with a smaller general waste bin. Source: Supplied/NCA\n\nPerth locals question new bin pick-up strategy\n\nLong-term Rockingham resident Thomas Soderholm said changing the bin collection timetable was a \"dumb\" cost-cutting measure. He said in a household of seven with a two-year-old who was still in nappies, leaving the bins out was \"going to stink\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Imagine if you have a crayfish party? In this case, it\u2019s nappies galore,\" he told The West Australian.\n\nThe impending changes has already received pushback from residents, who have set up petitions to fight the changes, one of which has already attracted more than 4,400 signatures.\n\nA motion to review the FOGO policy was shelved by Rockingham councillors in a meeting in March last year, where residents\u2019 concerns were raised. Earlier this month, Kwinana Mayor Peter Feasey announced the introduction of its three-bin system including the lime green GO (garden organics) bin.\n\n\"The introduction of the GO bin will make waste management smarter, cleaner, and more environmentally friendly, as well as promoting sustainable waste management practices in our community,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe explained \"a range of factors\" were considered to \"determine the appetite\" for a third bin, ranging from economic and environmental to social and governance. \"An average of 34 per cent of Kwinana\u2019s current general waste bin is filled with compostable garden organics,\" he said.\n\nCity of Kwinana Mayor, Peter Feasey using the new GO bin. Source: Supplied\n\n\"By separating garden waste, we can turn it into valuable compost, supporting a greener Kwinana.\"\n\nHowever, residents shared their distaste for the new system on a recent Facebook post from the council, arguing the move was a \"waste of money\" that \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem logical\".\n\nWhy are FOGO bins controversial and what do they do for the environment?\n\nFOGO bins have sparked controversy in many parts of Australia in recent times. The bins, designed to collect food scraps and garden waste for composting, aim to reduce landfill waste and cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, their implementation has been met with resistance due to concerns over odours, additional sorting efforts and potential costs for households. Some residents argue that the process is inconvenient, especially in warmer climates where decomposing food waste can create strong smells if not managed properly. Others worry about potential rate increases to fund collection and processing.\n\nDespite these concerns, supporters say FOGO bins offer clear environmental benefits. Food waste is a major contributor to landfill, where it produces methane \u2014 a potent greenhouse gas. By diverting organic waste to composting facilities, FOGO bins significantly reduce emissions while creating nutrient-rich compost that can improve soil health and support agriculture.\n\nMany councils that have adopted FOGO systems have reported reduced landfill costs and higher overall recycling rates. Additionally, when properly managed, odour issues can be minimised through the use of compostable liners and regular emptying.\n\nWhile some Australians remain skeptical, the bins' long-term environmental impact is clear. As landfill space becomes increasingly limited and climate concerns grow, transitioning to more sustainable waste management practices is a necessary step, experts say.\n\nwith NCA Newswire\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

But so far, no explanation has been offered as to why.\n\nCustomers say Coles staff are making them start the bagging process again if they fail to scan bulky items first. Source: Getty/Yahoo News Australia\n\nIn what appears to be a system increasing in prevalence at Coles supermarkets around the country, customers are again hitting out at what they say is a \"dumb\" self-checkout rule which requires shoppers to scan bulky items first.\n\nNumerous reports of the apparent policy first started emerging online last year, with Australians questioning why Coles staff told them to scan large items \u2014 such as boxed goods, value packs or bottled water \u2014 before everything else.\n\nIn many instances, shoppers said \"frantic\" employees even \"insisted\" they \"void\" their transactions to start again if they hadn't begun with bulky products, even if they were already well into the bagging process. Yahoo News has questioned Coles on multiple occasions about the alleged system, which is not communicated either in-store or online.\n\nIn the months since these cases starting emerging, so far there's been no detailed explanation. Coles told Yahoo its staff are encouraged to help shoppers process and scan bulky items first to reduce theft, but it didn't explain whether it's a proven, evidence-based approach. This week, another post on the matter attracted over 2,000 responses.\n\nColes has again attracted attention over a policy apparently enforced by staff that requires shoppers scan bulky items before everything else. Source: ABC/Facebook\n\nColes shoppers hit out over secretive anti-theft measure\n\nThose replying were largely fed-up customers. \"I was buying a few bits and pieces at Coles, including a 10-pack of canned water,\" it read. \"At the self-checkout, I scanned the smaller items first while I cradled the water and one of the helpers came to me a bit panicky.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"She asked if she could void the transaction so the waters would scan first. I said 'it's OK, it's already scanned' and I was ready to pay, but she pleaded with me to let her, or she'd get in trouble. I was a bit confused, but she seemed genuinely worried, so I let her. Can anyone explain why she needed to make sure the waters were scanned first?\"\n\nDo you work at Coles and have been asked to enforce this? Or has this happened to you as a shopper? Email Joe Attanasio at joe.attanasio@yahooinc.com\n\nOver 700 people wrote back, a significant portion revealing a similar experience. \"That explains the frantic worker yesterday. WTF,\" one person said. \"I noticed this too with bulky items. I imagine it's so you don't leave it in your cart and 'forget' to scan them,\" said another.\n\nThe supermarket earlier issued an apology to customers who had been told to void their transactions and start again. On Wednesday, Yahoo News questioned Coles again, asking to clarify the reasoning behind the policy.\n\nColes responds to self-serve policy\n\nWe asked when it was introduced and why it has not been publicly communicated to customers. In response, it claimed customers actually appreciate being assisted with their bulky items.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We know that helping our customers with bulky or heavy items can be a big help \u2014 this is all about providing great service\", a spokesperson said. \"The focus on having our team members scan the bulkier items first also helps to avoid situations where bulkier items are accidentally left in the trolley and not scanned.\n\n\"However, we certainly don\u2019t want our team members to \u2018void\u2019 a customer's shopping simply to have bulk items like toilet paper scanned first. In the isolated cases where this is happening, we would encourage our customers to provide us with this feedback directly, so we can provide coaching and prevent this.\"\n\nWhile it's certainly no secret that shoplifting is a major issue across Australia's supermarkets and retailers, with both Coles and Woolworths implementing a raft of recent measures to combat the problem, there doesn't appear to be any specific evidence or research that suggests scanning bulkier items first reduces instances of theft.\n\n\"It's 'meant' to stop theft of large items. It doesn't. But there are KPI's and reports that flag a self-serve attendant if they don't get scanned first,\" a person commented.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I\u2019ve had them demand I do the bulky ones first, like toilet paper. I want to do it last because it\u2019s light and the heavy things can go first,\" another person chimed in. \"The assistant rudely came up and pulled it out of my trolley to try to scan it at the self-checkout and argued with me about it.\"\n\n\"They always ask me if I want them to put the water through first, I just say no,\" another said.\n\nA person claiming to be a Coles employee urged the public not to take the policy out on floor staff.\n\n\"Please don't take it out on the staff at stores, this is a push by the upper levels to reduce theft. If you have a complaint about it, flood the customer care line or better yet, publicly do it on their Facebook and social media accounts.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Yes, the self-serve person \u2014 trying to manage 10 checkouts by themselves \u2014 will actually get in trouble if they don't get everyone to put the bulky items first,\" another apparent staffer said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
