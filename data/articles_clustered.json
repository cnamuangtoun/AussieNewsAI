    "text": "Casandra Ventura, the RnB singer and actor known simply as Cassie, began testifying overnight in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs ' sex trafficking trial. She is expected to return to the stand tonight.\n\nThe music mogul is charged with leveraging his status to coerce women \u2013 including Cassie \u2013 into abusive sexual encounters and using violence if they refused.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty. Cassie sued Combs in 2023 alleging years of rape and abuse.\n\nSinger Cassie Ventura, known as Cassie, is testifying against her former partner Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. (AP)\n\nThe suit was settled within hours, but was followed by dozens of similar legal claims and touched off a criminal investigation.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the 38-year-old star witness.\n\nA talented performer\n\nA singer, actor, dancer and model, Cassie's professional ambitions began in adolescence, when she signed to the top-tier talent and modelling agency Wilhelmina.\n\nHer music career launched shortly thereafter, when she left her home state of Connecticut for New York, where she signed with manager Tony Mottola and first met Combs.\n\nCassie is perhaps best known for the 2006 hit single Me & U , which secured the number one spot on the Billboard Hot RnB/Hip-Hop songs chart and number three on the Billboard Hot 100 all genres chart.\n\nIt was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThe song was the lead single of her only studio album, released by Combs' Bad Boy Records, and was self-titled.\n\nShe left the label in 2019.\n\nCassie with Diddy in 2015. (Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)\n\nAs an actor, she appeared in several television and film projects including Fox's Empire , The Perfect Match and Spenser Confidential . She made her acting debut in 2008 in Step Up 2: The Streets and contributed the song Is It You to its soundtrack.\n\nShe appeared in a number of music videos as well, including Wiz Khalifa's Roll Up and Mario's Just A Friend 2002.\n\nAlthough she never released her long-teased sophomore album, at one point tentatively titled Electro Love , she did drop a few tracks: the RnB-pop Official Girl with Lil Wayne, Must Be Love with Combs, and Let's Get Crazy with Akon.\n\nAnd in 2012, Nicki Minaj tapped her for a feature on The Boys from Minaj's Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded \u2013 The Re-Up .\n\nCassie is also a wife and a mother.\n\nShe married personal trainer Alex Fine in September 2019.\n\nTheir first daughter, Frankie Stone Fine, was born that same year and they welcomed their second daughter, Sunny Cinco Fine, in 2021.\n\nShe is currently pregnant with their third child, a son .\n\nCassie Ventura wipes tears from her eye while testifying in Manhattan federal court. (AP)\n\nThe Combs connection\n\nCassie met Combs in 2005 when she was 19 and he was 37. He signed her to his Bad Boy Records label and, within a few years, they started dating.\n\nIn her 2023 civil lawsuit, Cassie alleges Combs trapped her in a \"cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking\" for more than a decade, including raping her and forcing her to engage in sex acts with male sex workers. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day.\n\nIn May 2024, CNN aired video that showed Combs attacking Cassie in a hotel hallway in 2016.\n\nThe video closely mirrored an assault described in her lawsuit, which said Combs had already punched her that night, and she was trying to leave the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles when he woke and came after her.\n\nThis frame grab taken from hotel security camera video and aired by CNN appears to show Sean \"Diddy\" Combs attacking singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in March 2016. (AP)\n\nIn the footage, a man who appears to be Diddy, wearing only a towel, punches Cassie, kicks her, and throws her on to the floor.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Combs paid US$50,000 ($77,268.41) to bury the video at the time.\n\nLater, Combs apologised for the assault on Cassie in his first real acknowledgment of wrongdoing since the stream of allegations began.\n\nAmong other things, Cassie alleges Combs raped her when she tried to leave him and often punched, kicked and beat her, causing injuries including bruises, burst lips, black eyes and bleeding.\n\nShe also alleges that Combs was involved in blowing up rival rapper Kid Cudi's car when he learned that Cudi was romantically interested in her, and she alleges that Combs ran out of his home with guns when he learned that Suge Knight, a rival producer, was eating at a nearby diner.\n\nOn the first day of Combs' sex trafficking trial, a witness, Daniel Phillip, said he was a professional stripper who was paid US$700 to US$6000 ($1081.76 to $9272.21) to have sex with Cassie while Combs watched and gave instructions, with the first encounter in 2012.\n\nPhillip told jurors that he stopped meeting with the couple after he saw Combs throw a bottle at her and then drag her by her hair into a bedroom as she screamed.",

    "text": "In a digital world increasingly dominated by ephemeral media, independent publishing in Australia is experiencing a renaissance marked by creativity, collaboration and diverse narratives.\n\nSpurred on by National Reading Survey results, showing 42 per cent of Australians are \"occasional\" readers and read a book every 15 weeks at most, the Melbourne Art Book Fair (MABF) \u2014 part of this year's Design Week 2025 \u2014 is out to cultivate a vibrant reading culture.\n\nIndie publishers \"play a disproportionate role \u2026 in nurturing young talent\", Monash University media lecturer Ben Eltham told the ABC earlier this year. (Supplied: Melbourne Art Book Fair/Tobias Titz)\n\nThe Stallholder Fair, from May 16\u201318, showcases more than 100 leading publishers and artists from the Asia-Pacific region, with limited-edition books, prints and magazines.\n\nAnd the flourishing indie publishing scene is right at the forefront.\n\nIndie publishing movement\n\nIndie publishing \u2014 small scale, often self-directed and with a focus on unique content and alternative voices \u2014 is \"having a moment\", says Dr Megan Patty, publisher at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV), and founder and curator of the MABF.\n\nThat's in part because, in recent years, an influx of independent publishers has filled the gaps left by traditional publishing houses, offering fresh perspectives.\n\nThese publishers are part of a movement that focuses on collaboration, experimentation and support for emerging artists. They are a catalyst for creative dialogue and community-building.\n\nThe fair allows for \"real-world connections and conversations\" around books, curator Megan Patty says. (Supplied: Melbourne Art Book Fair/Tobias Titz)\n\nThe MABF has grown in response to this style of publishing, highlighting the importance of inclusivity and community-building in the literary world.\n\n\"Every year has been bigger and better for us,\" says Perimeter Books co-founder Dan Rule, a proud participant in the fair since its inception in 2014.\n\nEstablished in 2011, Perimeter has published more than 100 works focusing on the interrelation between a book's form and the content it carries.\n\nRule draws inspiration from art critics like late New Yorker critic Peter Schjeldahl, and works closely with artists to translate their ideas into publications.\n\n\"Being a publisher is inherently collaborative,\" Rule says; the creative process involves partnering with artists, designers and writers to bring their visions to life.\n\nResisting homogenisation\n\nIndie publishers face unique challenges, particularly in funding and business sustainability.\n\nRecently, three Australian independent publishing houses \u2014 Text, Affirm and Pantera \u2014 were acquired by multinational publishing houses.\n\nTakeovers of indie publishers 'bad for readers' Photo shows A stack of books with an open book on top; a wall lined with books in the background Small presses have dominated literary prizes in recent years, and larger publishers are buying them out. What do these acquisitions mean for the local publishing industry?\n\n\"History shows that mergers often result in the dissolution of the smaller imprint,\" editor and researcher Alice Grundy wrote in The Conversation.\n\nAnd while acquisitions by mainstream publishers can offer some positives, like increased distribution reach and financial stability, they also raise important concerns; namely, that being acquired could threaten indie publishers' editorial independence, leading to homogenisation and the loss of diverse, innovative voices.\n\nThose innovative voices include marginalised perspectives, those experimenting with form, and authors who are emerging.\n\nAs Rule notes: \"Independent publishers can take the kind of risks around the specificities of content, perspective and form that larger publishers simply cannot.\"\n\nTransforming ideas\n\nDespite the challenges, the industry is far from devoid of good news stories.\n\n\"Variety is good for the industry,\" Millicent Weber, lecturer in English at the ANU, told the ABC. (Supplied: Melbourne Art Book Fair/Sarah Pannell)\n\nPerimeter has built a flexible business model rooted in three pillars: publishing, distribution and retail, and Rule says this integrated approach ensures that each aspect supports the others.\n\nUro Publications, co-founded by Mat Ward and Andrew McKenzie nearly 20 years ago, has carved a niche as a leading publisher of architecture and design books.\n\n\"As a local architecture and design publisher, there needs to be a conversation about how we shape our built environment for the people that live here,\" Ward says, aligning with the fair's commitment to diverse narratives.\n\nUro's publications often challenge conventional formats, featuring authoritative voices from architectural critics and innovative practitioners, which \"foster fruitful discussions, [which] enrich the community, ultimately transforming how architecture is perceived\".\n\n\"I get a kick out of providing a platform for people to share their expertise and ideas,\" Ward says.\n\nGrowth year on year\n\nOver its 11-year history, the MABF has established itself as a vital platform, not only for showcasing innovative art and design publications, but for enhancing literacy and promoting cultural discourse across Australia.\n\n\"Every year, the anticipation builds,\" Dr Patty says.\n\n\"It's incredible to see how the fair continues to foster connections within the creative community and engage audiences in meaningful ways.\"\n\nSince its inception, more than 200,000 people have attended the MABF.\n\nFor Dr Patty, every interaction represents an opportunity to ignite a passion for reading, particularly among young children who are more likely to develop lifelong reading habits when exposed to vibrant art books and interactive storytelling experiences.\n\n\"Find your people, collaborate, and get offline,\" she says.\n\n\"Because it's in those real-world connections and conversations that the future of indie publishing truly takes shape.\"\n\nMelbourne Design Week and the Melbourne Art Book Fair run from May 15\u201325.",

    "text": "The AFL Players' Association (AFLPA) says they are disappointed in the immediate handling of a player's serious on-field injury after play was not stopped despite a clear concussion.\n\nCollingwood forward Lachie Schultz was badly concussed in the Magpies' win over Fremantle at Perth Stadium last Thursday when he attempted to tackle Dockers defender Jordan Clark.\n\nHe went to ground and was clearly concussed, with his arm involuntarily held up in the air.\n\nAudio obtained by Channel 7's The Agenda Setters revealed on Tuesday night that field umpires were aware Schultz was injured when they allowed play to continue while he was sprawled out on the turf. This is despite later telling the AFL they had not seen him.\n\n\"It is now clear that the umpires noticed Lachie Schultz's injury and had the opportunity to stop the play to ensure he left the field safely,\" AFLPA CEO Paul Marsh said.\n\n\"What this highlights to us is that the process of dealing with vital health and safety issues on the field is unclear, and there are many recent examples of the industry needing to better prepare everyone for when these situations occur.\n\n\"Equally, we are disappointed that the AFL failed to appropriately review a serious on-field incident but acknowledge that they have taken responsibility for this.\"\n\nThe audio revealed one umpire heard saying: \"We have got an injured player in the middle. I am watching \u2026 We are OK. We are OK.\"\n\nAfter Collingwood moved the ball inside 50, some of Schultz's teammates appealed for medical help. In the audio, an umpire is heard telling a player on the ground: \"We can only stop the play if the ball is coming near or if they instruct us to.\"\n\nThis contradicts a statement released by the AFL last Friday, which said play should have been stopped but the four umpires had not seen Schultz on the ground: \"The umpires did not see the injured player at the time, so play continued. Upon review, if the umpires were aware, play would have been stopped.\"\n\nAFL football boss Laura Kane said the AFL had initially been given the wrong information by the umpires but took full responsibility for the error.\n\n\"The statement we released was incorrect, but we were given the wrong information from the umpires,\" she said in a statement provided to Channel 7.\n\n\"It's inconsistent with the vision. They [the umpires] were going off memory and not the vision and we should always look at the vision.\n\n\"All the field umpires from the game have all been coached this afternoon that they should have stopped the game.\"\n\nMarsh added the union welcomed the opportunity to work with the industry to continually strengthen health and safety protocols for members, particularly given the seriousness of head injuries.",

    "text": "A farming community in Western Australia's remote south-east has questioned plans for a 300-block subdivision near one of the country's most pristine beaches.\n\nPerth-based developer John Bestall wants to create a \"holiday village-style\" precinct on his 607-hectare property, 770 kilometres south-east of Perth and 60km east of Esperance.\n\nHis plans, submitted to the Shire of Esperance, propose 1-8ha lots that would suit rural residential living or tourist accommodation, given the famous Wharton Beach and Duke of Orleans Bay are a five-minute drive down the road.\n\nHe also believes the project would support the future development of a new town site in the area.\n\nThe Orleans Bay Road property currently contains a tree plantation that would be harvested prior to development.\n\nThe applicant hopes to create a \"holiday village-style\" precinct near Wharton Beach, east of Esperance. (Supplied: Shire of Esperance)\n\nA new town?\n\nEsperance's current local planning strategy already supports a future town site at Wharton Beach, opposite the existing caravan park.\n\nThe area is a popular tourist destination with visitors regularly driving from Esperance to fish, camp, surf and see the famous white sand beaches.\n\nBut the region is remote and has little infrastructure apart from the caravan park and services at Condingup, 25km to the north.\n\nWith his land currently zoned as rural, Mr Bestall has asked for support to change the classification to allow for additional tourism, conservation and residential use.\n\nIt also proposes creating \"conservation covenants\" and leaving 144 hectares as a large rural lot to protect native vegetation.\n\nBig change for locals\n\nIn Condingup, a hub and meeting point for the local farming community, the project has sparked plenty of discussion.\n\nMarie Fowler, who farms in the area, believes long-time farmers wanting to retire locally would like the idea, while others would worry about its impact on the existing town.\n\nThe proposed development is between Condingup and Wharton Beach, 80km east of Esperance. (Supplied: Shire of Esperance)\n\n\"There's not an option [elsewhere] really to have that lifestyle block, a five-acre block or something a bit bigger,\" she said.\n\n\"So I think there is interest from that point of view.\n\n\" And that would be a positive because that will keep those people, those families, in Condingup and keep that connection to the community here. \"\n\nBut she said there was concern the new precinct may overwhelm Condingup as it could be more than three times its size.\n\nShe was interested to learn more as the process moved forward.\n\nWharton Beach is a short drive from the existing caravan park. (ABC Esperance: Hayden Smith)\n\nPeter Brown, a retiree who lives at the nearby caravan park, worried the development would put too much pressure on the area and lead to reduced accessibility to the coast.\n\n\"The Wharton town site, that's been spoken about ever since I can remember. Nothing ever happened with it,\" he said.\n\n\"Personally, I don't think it needs to be there.\"\n\nWhile he said the region desperately needed housing, he believed it should be closer to Esperance or Condingup.\n\n\"From my perspective I hope it doesn't go ahead,\" he said.\n\n\"But \u2026 that's maybe just being selfish.\"\n\nWharton Beach is among the most popular with tourists in the Esperance region. (ABC Esperance: Hayden Smith)\n\nEsperance Shire chief executive Shane Burge said if the subdivision was to happen, the developer would be responsible for putting in public amenities such as roads and green spaces.\n\nHe said the shire would take on responsibility once it was finished, funded through rates paid by new property owners.\n\nHe said the area would likely also need its own water supply scheme.\n\nBut he said the idea was still a long way off.\n\n\"There is [community] concern,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll make sure if the planning commission do support it that it's widely put out there [for public feedback].\"",

    "text": "The corporate regulator is suing the broking arm of Macquarie, alleging it misled the market by misreporting millions of short sales over more than a decade.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has started proceedings against Macquarie in the NSW Supreme Court \u2014 its fourth regulatory action against the investment bank in just over a year.\n\nASIC claims Macquarie Securities failed to correctly report the volume of short sales to the market operator between December 2009 and February 2024.\n\nIt is the first short sale reporting case brought by the regulator and alleges \"multiple systems-related issues, many of which remained undetected for over a decade\".\n\n\"This action is timely given significant recent global market volatility,\" ASIC chair Joe Longo said.\n\n\"Accurate and reliable data underpins the integrity of, and confidence in, Australia's financial markets. Investors expect reliable information to analyse market movements and inform their investment decisions.\"\n\nMacquarie said its securities arm identified issues with its daily reporting of short sales and reported them to ASIC in late 2022.\n\nIt later found a number of related issues, which it also reported to the regulator.\n\n\"The reporting issues identified in the proceedings have been remediated with additional controls implemented,\" Macquarie said in a statement.\n\nThe regulator alleges that Macquarie failed to correctly report the volume of short sales by at least 73 million \u2014 but estimates it could be between 298 million and 1.5 billion sales.\n\nIt says accurate reporting of short sale data is important to \"inform investors, governments, regulators and financial market participants about market sentiment and potential risks\".\n\nRegulations requiring the reporting of short sales were introduced following the 2008 global financial crisis, when short selling contributed to the unprecedented market volatility.\n\nMacquarie said it was reviewing ASIC's claim and could not comment further as the matter was before the court.\n\n\"Macquarie takes its compliance obligations very seriously and continues to invest in programs to further improve systems and controls across the Group,\" its statement read.\n\nWhat is short selling?\n\nShort selling is a strategy that aims to profit off the price of a financial product falling.\n\nIn the case of shares, it would involve \"borrowing\" a stock and selling it immediately, before buying it back in the future at a (hopefully lower) price, to replace the stock borrowed and pocket the price difference as profit.\n\nIt comes with the risk that the stock price does not fall and the short seller is left with an unprofitable position.\n\nSignificant short positions affect broader sentiment around a stock, given they indicate people are betting on price falls.\n\nThe strategy is sometimes employed by so-called activist short sellers, which ASIC describes as \"a person taking a short position in a financial product and then publicly disseminating information\u2026 to negatively impact the price of the product\".\n\nActivist short-selling campaigns can take the form of formal reports or informal methods such as social media posts.",

    "text": "Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning writer and director of Kramer vs. Kramer, has died aged 92.\n\nBenton's son, John Benton, said that he died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan of \"natural causes.\"\n\nDuring a 40-year screen career, the Texas native received six Oscar nominations and won three times: for writing and directing Kramer vs. Kramer and for writing Places in the Heart.\n\nHe co-wrote Arthur Penn's groundbreaking crime thriller Bonnie and Clyde, starring Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, with David Newman.\n\nBut it is his script and direction on Kramer vs. Kramer \u2014 the 1979 film that offered an unflinching look at divorce and went on to become one of the most awarded films of its time \u2014 that he is arguably best known for.\n\nThe movie picked up nine Oscar nominations and brought home five: Benton's Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as Best Actor for Dustin Hoffman, Best Supporting Actress for Meryl Streep and the year's grand prize of Best Picture.\n\nMeryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman pose with the Oscars they won for their performances in Kramer vs. Kramer at the 52nd annual Academy Awards in 1980. (AP Photo)\n\nBenton was also widely appreciated by actors as attentive and trusting, and directed Oscar-winning performances by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Sally Field.\n\nBut despite coaxing winning performances out of a host of 20th-century legends, Benton was known in Hollywood as a self-effacing director.\n\n\"I have found actors \u2014 through luck, through the judgement of casting directors or through my own instinct \u2014 that are extraordinarily good,\" he told the crowd.\n\n\"There's a thing you've just got to gamble with, and when you see it and it works, it's brilliant.\"\n\nAsked how he got some of Tinseltown's biggest stars to perform for him, he deadpanned: \"I tried not to get in their way \u2026 that's not so easy.\"\n\nOscar-winning triumphs\n\nBenton was an art director for Esquire magazine in the early 1960s when a love for French New Wave movies and old gangster stories (and news that a friend got $25,000 for a Doris Day screenplay) inspired him and Newman to draft a treatment about the lives of Depression-era robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, imagining them as prototypes for 1960s rebels.\n\nTheir project took years to complete as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were among the directors who turned them down before Warren Beatty agreed to produce and star in the movie.\n\nBonnie and Clyde, directed by Arthur Penn and starring Beatty and Faye Dunaway, overcame initial critical resistance in 1967 to the film's shocking violence and became one of the touchstones of 1960s culture and the start of a more open and creative era in Hollywood.\n\nBenton arrives for the screening of Feast of Love in New York in 2017. (AP: Rick Maiman)\n\nOver the following decade, none of Benton's films approached the same impact, although he continued to have critical and commercial success.\n\nHis writing credits included Superman and What's Up, Doc? and he directed and co-wrote The Late Show, a melancholy comedy for which his screenplay received an Oscar nomination.\n\nBut his career soared in 1979 with his adaptation of the Avery Corman novel Kramer vs. Kramer, about a self-absorbed advertising executive who becomes a loving parent to his young son after his wife walks out, only to have her return and ask for custody.\n\nStarring Hoffman and Streep, the movie was praised as a perceptive, emotional portrait of changing family roles and expectations and received five Academy Awards, including best picture.\n\nHoffman, disenchanted at the time with the film business, would cite Kramer vs. Kramer and Benson's direction for reviving his love for movie acting.\n\n\"Somebody asked me once when the Academy Award nominations came out and I'd been nominated, 'What's the great thing about the Academy Awards?'\" Benton told Venice magazine.\n\n\"I said, 'When you go to the awards and you see people, some of whom you've had bitter fights with, some of whom you're close friends with, some people you haven't seen in 10 years, some people you just saw two days before \u2014 it's your family'.\n\n\"It's home. And home is what I've spent my life looking for.\"\n\nFive years later, Benton was back in the Oscars race with a more personal film, Places in the Heart, in which he drew upon family stories and childhood memories for his 1930s-set drama starring Fields as a mother of two in Texas who fights to hold on to her land after her husband is killed.\n\nA lifelong movie fan\n\nBenton was born in Waxahachie, Texas, outside of Dallas.\n\nHe owed his early love for movies to his father, telephone company employee Ellery Douglass Benton, who, instead of asking about homework, would take his family to the picture shows.\n\nThe elder Benton would also share memories of attending the funerals of outlaws Barrow and Parker, Texas natives who grew up in the Dallas area.\n\nThe filmmaker studied at the University of Texas and Columbia University, then served in the US Army from 1954 until 1956.\n\nBetween hits, Benton often endured long dry spells.\n\nHis latter films included such disappointments as the thrillers Billy Bathgate, The Human Stain and Twilight.\n\nHe had much more success with Nobody's Fool, a wry comedy released in 1994 and starring Paul Newman, in his last Oscar-nominated performance, as a small-town troublemaker in upstate New York.\n\nBenton, whose film was based on Russo's novel, was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nThe filmmaker is survived by his son. His wife of six decades, Sallie, died in 2023.\n\nAP/AFP",

Another one, and he is out of the race.\n\nPicnic-PostNL rider Bram Welten was also carded for sitting up and decelerating into the chasing pack after leading out for eventual winner, Casper van Uden.\n\nVan Uden led a Dutch 1-2-3, with the grand tour debutant surprising the peloton by holding off compatriots Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Maikel Zijlaard (Tudoe Pro) in a tense finish.\n\nPink jersey wearer Mads Pedersen was fourth, a disappointment for the Dane who had already won two stages, but also a relief after being close to two crashes.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nOne involved most of his Lidl-Trek team and the other took out his final lead-out man, Soren Kragh Andersen, who appeared to have badly injured his left wrist.\n\nPedersen's general classification lead over pre-race favourite Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was cut to seven seconds after the Slovenian picked up an intermediate sprint bonus. Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) is seven seconds further adrift.\n\nAustralia's best GC hope, Michael Storer (Tudor Pro), is ninth, 36 seconds behind Pedersen.\n\nGroves should have another chance in the fifth stage, a 151km ride from Ceglie Messapica to Matera with a rising finish.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "A very useful note from Capital Economics on the state of play with US tariffs following Donald Trump's backdown and 90-day 'reciprocal' tariff pause with China announced on Monday.\n\nThe firm's group chief economist Neil Shearing and global chief economist Jennifer McKeown borrow from Winston Churchill in concluding, \"this may not be the beginning of the end of the trade war \u2014 but it could be the end of the beginning.\"\n\n\"The recent climbdown has left the effective US tariff rate on the rest of the world at around 15% as opposed to the 27% which was threatened at the height of this year's trade war,\" they note. \"While this is still the highest since the 1930s, it is unlikely to cause a global or US recession. But we are not out of the woods yet.\"\n\nThey offer a useful summary of where US tariff policy currently stands.\n\nCurrent US tariff rates (Capital Economics)\n\n\"The 25% sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminium, automobiles, and auto parts announced in March and April remain in place, albeit with rebates for vehicles assembled in the US and a partial exemption for the UK,\" Shearing and McKeown note. \"The 10% universal tariffs announced on Liberation Day are also still in place. There are exemptions for electronics (including smartphones and semiconductors), critical minerals and energy. \"Since the Liberation Day 'reciprocal tariffs' are on hold for 90 days from 9th April, and USMCA-compliant imports are now exempt from Canada and Mexico's 25% tariff, the only significant new nation-specific tariffs since the start of Trump's second term are on China.\"\n\nIn total, tariffs on most Chinese exports to the US stand at 30%.\n\nHowever, the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs from Liberation Day are merely paused, not yet abandoned.\n\n\"The most obvious flashpoint falls on 8th July, when the original 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is due to expire. The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China will then expire on 12th August,\" Shearing and McKeown write. \"If countries are unable to reach a deal with the US ahead of these deadlines then reciprocal tariffs could in theory revert to the levels announced on 2nd April. This would push up the effective US tariff rate by 7%-pts compared to its current level. \"It will be extremely difficult for the US to negotiate deals with 180+ countries in the next two months and, given the constitutional role of Congress, any deals that are done will fall well short of the 'full and comprehensive' trade agreements that President Trump has talked about. \"In practice, we think it is likely that the pause on reciprocal tariffs will be extended for those countries that fail to agree a deal with the US ahead of these deadlines. However, it is possible that the administration will take it down to the wire before announcing extensions. If so, this could presage more volatility in financial markets.\"\n\nThe economists warn that the US is still considering \"sector-specific\" tariffs in a range of key areas, with semiconductors a particular risk both to global supply chains and certain countries such as Taiwan, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\n\"Sector-specific tariffs are another key area to watch. Section 232 investigations are still underway in the US to assess the potential security threat from imports of copper, timber and lumber, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, trucks and commercial aircraft,\" Shearing and McKeown explain.\n\nThen there's the big elephant in the room \u2014 China.\n\nNot only has the US targeted China directly with higher tariffs, it is also looking to strike trade deals that further isolate its rival superpower from other trading partners. And this might make US-China negotiations over a longer-term trade deal particularly thorny.\n\n\"It is notable that last week's US-UK agreement contained clauses that appear designed to force the UK to exclude China from supply chains of strategically-important goods. Many countries would accede to similar demands,\" Shearing and McKeown observe. \"But if this is widespread, it will not only make it harder for the US to agree deals with some countries that have close ties with China, it will also make it harder for the US to agree a lasting deal with China itself.\"\n\nSo, while there's great relief at this week's US-China tariff step down, as Churchill said after the Allies' victory against the Axis forces at El Alamein: \"This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\"",

Credit: AP Even celebrities joined in, with Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney turning Wrexham \u2013 then a National League club in the fifth tier of English football \u2013 into a global media story. Australians have also made their mark in lower leagues. Sydney-based businessman Clem Morfuni took over Swindon Town in 2021, rescuing the club from financial collapse. At Southend United, a consortium led by Australian businessman Justin Rees has taken control after years of chaos and the club\u2019s near-expulsion.\n\nThe Civitas group, which also includes former AFL player Ray Wilson \u2013 the former Hastings Funds Management chairman \u2013 and Tim Cheong, a tax partner at Moore Australia, bought into Sutton as minority shareholders in late 2023. Since then, Civitas has been heavily contributing to the club\u2019s operations and quietly transforming its DNA. Rather than chasing headlines or superstar signings, the Civitas style is focused on long-term foundations. The London club hopes to be building a promising future based on sustainable growth. Credit: SUFC First, it brought the players and training facilities back home to the heart of Sutton. Previously training near Heathrow \u2013 an hour away \u2013 players now prepare just metres from their match-day ground, Gander Green Lane. \u201cWe found out who really wanted to be part of the club. Some didn\u2019t want to make the move. That was telling,\u201d Lovett says. \u201cBut I think people finally saw us as walking the talk ... we\u2019re bringing things back to the community.\u201d\n\nNext came the backroom transformation. Civitas installed a new sporting department, prioritising data-driven recruitment and performance. Enter \u201cSwiss Amber\u201d \u2013 a proprietary analytics platform developed in-house to scout, track and profile talent based on KPIs specific to Sutton\u2019s evolving style. \u201cClubs in lower leagues often recruit based on who played well against them last week,\u201d Alexiou says. \u201cWe\u2019re applying the same data principles used in the Premier League \u2013 just tailored to our reality.\u201d They\u2019re not chasing Hollywood endings; they\u2019re building systems. Slowly, methodically. Sutton\u2019s historic Gander Green Lane is now also home to the Crystal Palace Women\u2019s Super League team, thanks to a landmark 10-year partnership that\u2019s upgrading facilities and generating revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d says Alexiou. \u201cA true partnership with Crystal Palace. They\u2019ve invested in the ground, installed a Premier League-quality pitch, and brought real visibility. We\u2019ve now got the best surface in the National League \u2013 and we didn\u2019t pay a pound for it.\u201d\n\nSutton United FC investor Craig Lovett. There\u2019s also a community element that can\u2019t be faked. The club has partnered with the Royal Marsden Hospital, fostering local health and outreach initiatives that reflect the club\u2019s roots. Sutton\u2019s staff and players are becoming part of the borough\u2019s day-to-day fabric. While firmly planted in English soil, the Civitas vision extends across the hemisphere. The long-term dream is to create a multi-club model, linking teams across the United States, Europe and potentially Australia \u2013 each operating sustainably, sharing lessons, and developing talent. But first comes connecting with Australians abroad. Nicknamed \u201cThe U\u2019s\u201d, Sutton United recently launched targeted promotions to engage the Aussie expat community in London, beginning with local outreach in Clapham, a known hub for Australians and New Zealanders. \u201cWe want Sutton to be the club for Aussies in the UK,\u201d Lovett says. \u201cAffordable, authentic football in a proper ground. Not \u00a3100 Premier League tickets that aren\u2019t accessible to most fans.\u201d\n\nThere are plans to eventually establish an Australian talent pathway, creating opportunities for young players from the A-League or NPL to cut their teeth in England while avoiding the brutal churn of top-tier academies. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving them the right environment \u2013 not just a shot at glory, but time to grow,\u201d Alexiou adds. The club founded in 1898 plays out of Gander Green Lane in the National League. Credit: SUFC Unlike many lower-league takeovers, the group isn\u2019t looking for a quick flip. \u201cThis is a long-term play. We\u2019re talking decades, not seasons,\u201d Alexiou says. \u201cWe want to create a club that can outlive us. One that\u2019s profitable, and built to last.\u201d\n\nSutton United is known for its rich local heritage. Credit: SUFC Sutton United and its new-look young squad finished the 2024-25 National League season mid-table, a result that the group knows loyal fans \u2013 the Amber Army \u2013 won\u2019t be overly happy about. But managed by Steve Morison, a former player with Norwich in the top-flight, the team reached the final of the National League Cup (losing 2\u20131 at home to Leeds United\u2019s Under-23 team last month) \u2013 an exciting prospect for a club whose recent history has been mostly about survival. There\u2019s a quiet confidence to what the group is building. They know they don\u2019t have billionaire backers or blockbuster branding, but they also know what they do have: data, experience, heart, and a long view. \u201cWe\u2019re not pretending to be Wrexham,\u201d Lovett says. \u201cWe believe if we keep doing things the right way \u2013 recruitment, training, community \u2013 there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be a championship team in the medium term.\u201d\n\nSutton United may never be the loudest name in English football. But with its new Aussie engine room, it might be one of the smartest. From their base in Melbourne, Alexiou and Lovett are infusing Sutton United with a blueprint that echoes successful models back home \u2013 like the Western Bulldogs or Geelong in the AFL, clubs that have become community institutions, not just sporting entities. To partner with the Royal Marsden Hospital, the club wore a purple kit for solidarity in their match against Dagenham & Redbridge. \u201cIt was actually the first thing we did when we bought into the club,\u201d Alexiou says, noting the importance of embedding the club deeper into its community from day one. Their approach is influenced by the tradition and passion they\u2019ve found at Sutton \u2013 a club steeped in local pride, not just results. \u201cYou sit there and these guys in the crowd are talking about FA Cup wins in 1989 against Coventry City,\u201d Alexiou says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe \u2026 very hard to replicate something like that. We want every Australian in London to feel they are a part of this, too.\u201d",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were cheers and fading fears on Wall Street overnight after news of a truce in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets rebounded strongly after the US and China agreed to cut tariffs on each other's imports by 115 per cent for 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sent the S&P 500 surging by more than 3 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq catapulted 4.4 per cent higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt means it's now 22.5 per cent above its low point in early April.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile investors hailed the move, analysts were more cautious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've gone from okay to apocalyptic, to sort of merely bad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Noland is the executive vice president and director of studies for the Peterson Institute of International Economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When Donald Trump was inaugurated, we were 'okay.' The tariff rates were probably somewhere on the order of 15 percent to 20 percent. Then through an escalatory spiral, they rose to 145 percent. China's actually applied tariffs on us were even higher. And now they've been reduced to something on the border of 30 percent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Noland says prices will still be higher, with ongoing uncertainty and delays likely to continue for some time to come.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's certainly good news for American businesses reliant on Chinese goods - but many of these have also reacted with measured relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It kind of feels a little bit like we dodged a hurricane, we didn't get free of the wind and the rain, but so far, we've dodged major impact.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJay Foreman is the CEO of the toy company Basic Joy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And our hope is, from here, is the 30 percent will maybe go down to 10 percent or less.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur Brunner says it's a hope shared by European investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's the director of market making bonds at ICF bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c The stock markets started the new week with a bang. The DAX set a new all-time high shortly after the opening. The reason here is the hope for a permanent, lasting agreement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian markets were more mixed today, not matching the surge in the US and Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists warn that tariffs are still higher than before, and the future of talks between Beijing and Washington is far from certain.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump says he\u2019ll likely speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the end of the week.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector-general of the World Trade Organisation, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is calling for a bit more chill.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Sussan Ley has been elected as the Liberal Party's first female leader.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Ley became the most senior woman in the party's 80-year history, winning the party room vote 29 to 25 over Opposition Treasury spokesperson Angus Taylor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mother-of-three is no stranger to high-profile roles, having previously held environment and health portfolios as well as the deputy Liberal leadership under Peter Dutton.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 63-year-old acknowledged her globe-trotting childhood in her first remarks as leader, stating hers is a \"migrant story\".\n\n\n\nSo what do we know about Sussan Ley and what can we expect from her leadership?\n\n\n\nWho is Sussan Ley?\n\nNigerian-born Ley was raised primarily in the Middle East, moving to the United Arab Emirates with her English family before she was two.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2014 profile, Ley told SBS how she accompanied her father during fieldwork for British intelligence agency MI6. It was during these trips that she first embraced a passion for diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe previously described her time at a boarding school in Sussex, England from the age of 10 as \"tough\" but \"a defining period of time\" that nurtured her interest in politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the age of 13, her family had moved to Australia. After briefly dabbling in cattle farming in Queensland, they moved to Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was here she embraced punk culture, opting for spiked purple hair, black lipstick and multiple piercings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a way of expressing yourself purely in terms of your own identity and not taking on anyone else\u2019s views about anything. I liked that,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\"People sometimes assume that by being a punk, you weren\u2019t a conservative, but quite clearly you could be and I was then.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter leaving school, she added another 's' to her first name because of a numerological belief it would change her personality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I worked out that if you added an 's' I would have an incredibly exciting, interesting life and nothing would ever be boring,\" she told The Australian newspaper in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nLey has worked many jobs, including air traffic controller, shearer, cook and wool and beef farmer as well as public servant. She also got her commercial pilot's licence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grandmother of six also studied at university as a mature aged student, completing a bachelor of economics and masters qualifications in tax and accounting.\n\n\n\nLife in politics: from same-sex marriage flips to class actions\n\nLey's more than two decades in parliament (she was elected as the member for Farrer in south-west NSW in 2001) have not been without controversy.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has openly admitted when she's changed her mind on issues throughout her time in office, including eventually supporting same-sex marriage after initially opposing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011, she was the co-chair of the parliament\u2019s Friends of Palestine group and spent 10 days in the occupied West Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon her return, she gave a speech to parliament in which she said: \"I support the Palestinian bid for statehood in part because it will give heart to the ordinary people of the West Bank and Gaza.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, as the Opposition's party leader, she says she views the issue differently, highlighting she has since been on a trip to Israel.\n\n\n\n\"Right now, what we\u2019re seeing is not a party interested peace with Israel, not a party interested in a secure Israel behind secure borders and not a party interested in a just and lasting peace,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017 she was forced to step down as health minister in the Turnbull government following revelations she made taxpayer-funded chartered flights to the Gold Coast, during which she bought a property.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore recently, as environment minister in 2022 she appealed a class action by eight children, arguing she did not have a duty of care to protect young people from climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Australia Day this year, she compared the arrival of the First Fleet to Elon Musk's SpaceX Mars mission, calling British settlement a \"daring experiment\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And just like astronauts arriving on Mars, those first settlers would be confronted with a different and strange world, full of danger, adventure and potential,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia Day became a public holiday in 1994 and marks the day the First Fleet landed in Sydney Cove in 1788. But many Australians, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, now refer to it as Invasion Day or Survival Day.\n\n\n\nWhat can we expect from her leadership?\n\nAhead of the leadership decision, experts told SBS News that Ley could take a more moderate approach to leadership than her predecessor Peter Dutton.\n\n\n\nAmy Remeikis, the chief political analyst for policy think tank The Australia Institute, said Ley can be a mixed bag in her views.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While she is more moderate than Dutton and Taylor, she straddles this weird section in between being a moderate and a conservative,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She's a regional Liberal and while she has had some more moderate views, particularly when it comes to women, for a while there she was against live export.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to economic policy, Ley appears to be in line with traditional Liberal values of small government and reduced taxes, Remeikis said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Mark Rolfe, a lecturer in the school of social sciences at the University of NSW, said Ley's leadership could deal with a perceived \"gender problem\" within the Liberal Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we see the number of teal representatives, and the lack of female Liberals, its clear that professional women voters have departed from the Liberal Party,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"The issue of gender voting has confounded the Liberals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing her ascent to leader, Ley admitted the Coalition had \"let women down\" at the federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is no doubt about that, and that is true, the number of women that are supporting us is declining, and I want to rule the line under that,\" she told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nRolfe said Ley would have a challenging path as leader of a party that is mostly made up of conservative MPs.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Mickel, former Labor MP and adjunct associate professor at the Queensland University of Technology, said appearing moderate could be the key to winning back voters, particularly professional women.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "But as TV rights boomed and the Premier League gained international appeal, clubs attracted celebrity backers and foreign billionaires. Roman Abramovich\u2019s takeover of Chelsea in 2003 signalled a new era, followed by the Glazers at Manchester United and Sheikhs and sovereign wealth at Manchester City and Newcastle. Roman Abramovich lifts the Champions League trophy with Chelsea in 2012. Credit: AP Even celebrities joined in, with Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney turning Wrexham \u2013 then a National League club in the fifth tier of English football \u2013 into a global media story. Australians have also made their mark in lower leagues. Sydney-based businessman Clem Morfuni took over Swindon Town in 2021, rescuing the club from financial collapse. At Southend United, a consortium led by Australian businessman Justin Rees has taken control after years of chaos and the club\u2019s near-expulsion.\n\nThe Civitas group, which also includes former AFL player Ray Wilson \u2013 the former Hastings Funds Management chairman \u2013 and Tim Cheong, a tax partner at Moore Australia, bought into Sutton as minority shareholders in late 2023. Since then, Civitas has been heavily contributing to the club\u2019s operations and quietly transforming its DNA. Rather than chasing headlines or superstar signings, the Civitas style is focused on long-term foundations. The London club hopes to be building a promising future based on sustainable growth. Credit: SUFC First, it brought the players and training facilities back home to the heart of Sutton. Previously training near Heathrow \u2013 an hour away \u2013 players now prepare just metres from their match-day ground, Gander Green Lane. \u201cWe found out who really wanted to be part of the club. Some didn\u2019t want to make the move. That was telling,\u201d Lovett says. \u201cBut I think people finally saw us as walking the talk ... we\u2019re bringing things back to the community.\u201d\n\nNext came the backroom transformation. Civitas installed a new sporting department, prioritising data-driven recruitment and performance. Enter \u201cSwiss Amber\u201d \u2013 a proprietary analytics platform developed in-house to scout, track and profile talent based on KPIs specific to Sutton\u2019s evolving style. \u201cClubs in lower leagues often recruit based on who played well against them last week,\u201d Alexiou says. \u201cWe\u2019re applying the same data principles used in the Premier League \u2013 just tailored to our reality.\u201d They\u2019re not chasing Hollywood endings; they\u2019re building systems. Slowly, methodically. Sutton\u2019s historic Gander Green Lane is now also home to the Crystal Palace Women\u2019s Super League team, thanks to a landmark 10-year partnership that\u2019s upgrading facilities and generating revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d says Alexiou. \u201cA true partnership with Crystal Palace. They\u2019ve invested in the ground, installed a Premier League-quality pitch, and brought real visibility. We\u2019ve now got the best surface in the National League \u2013 and we didn\u2019t pay a pound for it.\u201d\n\nSutton United FC investor Craig Lovett. There\u2019s also a community element that can\u2019t be faked. The club has partnered with the Royal Marsden Hospital, fostering local health and outreach initiatives that reflect the club\u2019s roots. Sutton\u2019s staff and players are becoming part of the borough\u2019s day-to-day fabric. While firmly planted in English soil, the Civitas vision extends across the hemisphere. The long-term dream is to create a multi-club model, linking teams across the United States, Europe and potentially Australia \u2013 each operating sustainably, sharing lessons, and developing talent. But first comes connecting with Australians abroad. Nicknamed \u201cThe U\u2019s\u201d, Sutton United recently launched targeted promotions to engage the Aussie expat community in London, beginning with local outreach in Clapham, a known hub for Australians and New Zealanders. \u201cWe want Sutton to be the club for Aussies in the UK,\u201d Lovett says. \u201cAffordable, authentic football in a proper ground. Not \u00a3100 Premier League tickets that aren\u2019t accessible to most fans.\u201d\n\nThere are plans to eventually establish an Australian talent pathway, creating opportunities for young players from the A-League or NPL to cut their teeth in England while avoiding the brutal churn of top-tier academies. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving them the right environment \u2013 not just a shot at glory, but time to grow,\u201d Alexiou adds. The club founded in 1898 plays out of Gander Green Lane in the National League. Credit: SUFC Unlike many lower-league takeovers, the group isn\u2019t looking for a quick flip. \u201cThis is a long-term play. We\u2019re talking decades, not seasons,\u201d Alexiou says. \u201cWe want to create a club that can outlive us. One that\u2019s profitable, and built to last.\u201d\n\nSutton United is known for its rich local heritage. Credit: SUFC Sutton United and its new-look young squad finished the 2024-25 National League season mid-table, a result that the group knows loyal fans \u2013 the Amber Army \u2013 won\u2019t be overly happy about. But managed by Steve Morison, a former player with Norwich in the top-flight, the team reached the final of the National League Cup (losing 2\u20131 at home to Leeds United\u2019s Under-23 team last month) \u2013 an exciting prospect for a club whose recent history has been mostly about survival. There\u2019s a quiet confidence to what the group is building. They know they don\u2019t have billionaire backers or blockbuster branding, but they also know what they do have: data, experience, heart, and a long view. \u201cWe\u2019re not pretending to be Wrexham,\u201d Lovett says. \u201cWe believe if we keep doing things the right way \u2013 recruitment, training, community \u2013 there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be a championship team in the medium term.\u201d\n\nSutton United may never be the loudest name in English football. But with its new Aussie engine room, it might be one of the smartest. From their base in Melbourne, Alexiou and Lovett are infusing Sutton United with a blueprint that echoes successful models back home \u2013 like the Western Bulldogs or Geelong in the AFL, clubs that have become community institutions, not just sporting entities. To partner with the Royal Marsden Hospital, the club wore a purple kit for solidarity in their match against Dagenham & Redbridge. \u201cIt was actually the first thing we did when we bought into the club,\u201d Alexiou says, noting the importance of embedding the club deeper into its community from day one. Their approach is influenced by the tradition and passion they\u2019ve found at Sutton \u2013 a club steeped in local pride, not just results. \u201cYou sit there and these guys in the crowd are talking about FA Cup wins in 1989 against Coventry City,\u201d Alexiou says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe \u2026 very hard to replicate something like that. We want every Australian in London to feel they are a part of this, too.\u201d",
