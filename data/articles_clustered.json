    "text": "Pope Leo XIV's choice of name signals a commitment to social justice that is very much in line with the late Pope Francis' global ministry.\n\n\"I think a lot of us had a question mark when they elected an American, and then he selected the name Pope Leo XIV,\" said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, the chair of religious studies at Manhattan University.\n\n\"It really means to me he will continue the work of Leo XIII.\"\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Vatican names first American Pope Leo XIV \ufeff\n\nNewly elected Pope Leo XIV chose a name with multiple resonances. (AP)\n\nPope Leo XIII, who was head of the Catholic Church from 1878 to 1903, laid the foundation for modern Catholic social thought, most famously with his 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, which addressed workers' rights and capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age.\n\nHe criticised both laissez-faire capitalism and state-centric socialism, giving shape to a distinctly Catholic vein of economic teaching.\n\nThe name \"is a deep sign of commitment to social issues,\" said Imperatori-Lee.\n\nPope Leo XIII led the Catholic Church from 1878 until 1903. (Nine)\n\n\"I think this (new) pope is saying something about social justice, by choosing this name, that it is going to be a priority. He is continuing a lot of Francis' ministry,\" she said.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed that choice of the name Leo was a reference to Leo XIII and the social doctrine of the church, in particular the Rerum Novarum encyclical, considered the Catholic Church's first social encyclical.\n\nAnother predecessor, Pope Leo I, was known for repelling the barbarian invasion of Atilla the Hun in 452 CE and dissuading him from sacking Rome through diplomacy, Italian Cardinal Mauro Piacenza told RAI Italian state TV.\n\nA portrait of Pope Leo I by Francisco de Herrera. (Supplied)\n\nHe also noted that Pope Leo XIII elevated the Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii to a papal basilica in 1901.\n\nLeo could also refer to Brother Leo, the 13th century friar who was a great companion of Saint Francis of Assisi. By choosing such a name, the new pope could be signaling also a very strong continuity with Francis, who named himself after the saint.\n\nFor most of the Catholic Church's first millennium, popes used their given names. The first exception was the 6th century Roman Mercurius, who had been named for a pagan god and chose the more appropriate name of John II.\n\nWhite smoke billows from Sistine Chapel chimney as new pope elected View Gallery\n\nThe practice of adopting a new name became ingrained during the 11th century, a period of German popes who chose names of early church bishops out of \"a desire to signify continuity,\" according to Reverend Roberto Regoli, a historian at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University.\n\nFor many centuries, new popes tended to choose the name of the pope who had elevated them to cardinal. John was the most popular, chosen by 23 popes, followed by Benedict and Gregory, each with 16.\n\nIt was from the mid-20th century that new popes began to choose names signaling the aim of their papacy, Regoli said.",

    "text": "The vast number of sheep in New Zealand relative to the country's scant human population has long been the subject of jokes aimed at New Zealanders abroad. It's true: The country is one of a handful in the world that's still home to more sheep than people.\n\nBut humans are catching up, according to new figures released Tuesday. With a population of 23.6 million sheep and 5.3 million people, there are about 4.5 sheep for each New Zealander, government statistics agency data showed.\n\nThat's down from 22 sheep per person in 1982, when farming sheep for meat and wool was New Zealand's biggest earner. Now, years of falling wool prices prompted by a global shift to synthetic fibres have led farmers to change what they do with their land, the sector's biggest lobby group said.\n\nFarmer Ross Turner feeds his sheep hay in his snow-covered paddocks on the outskirts of Christchurch, New Zealand, July 12, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Baker, File)\n\nA shrinking flock\n\nBy land area, New Zealand is about the size of the United Kingdom, but it has a human population 13 times smaller than the UK. That means there's plenty of room for sheep.\n\nFor close to 150 years, the sheep industry was the backbone of New Zealand's economy and numbers boomed \u2014 peaking in 1982 when there were more than 70 million sheep and just 3.2 million people.\n\nBefore Lord of the Rings brought waves of tourists to the country, images of green fields filled with placid sheep against backdrops of snow-capped mountains dominated the country's marketing abroad.\n\nBut over years of decline for global wool prices since \u2014 and despite recent rallies \u2014 the national flock has steadily diminished.\n\nNow dairy holds the biggest share of New Zealand's agriculture and horticulture-dominant export market.\n\nFarm manager Josh Jackson musters sheep on Withers Farm in Kaipara Flats on May 25, 2023, in Auckland, New Zealand. Josh (Getty)\n\nFarmers try something new\n\nIn 2023, Stats NZ, a government agency, said New Zealand in 2022 dipped below five sheep per person for the first time.\n\nThe national flock had lost a million more sheep in Tuesday's figures, which recorded livestock numbers as of June 2024.\n\nToby Williams, a spokesperson for sector lobby group Federated Farmers, said sheep farmers have switched to more lucrative pursuits \u2014 dairy, or the conversion of land from farming to pine forestry in order to sell carbon offsets.\n\n\"If I'm really honest, the wool industry is almost at that tipping point, if not already there, of not having a wool industry anymore,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Mum revealed as woman under guard over deadly fire\n\nMeasures to bolster wool\n\nThe government has drawn up measures intended to slow the decline, including an announcement in 2024 that they will place limits on the scale of farmland that can be converted to carbon forestry.\n\nNew government procurement guidelines launched in April urge the use of New Zealand wool products \u2014 such as carpets and insulation \u2014 in newly constructed or refurbished public buildings. But those measures are not expected to halt declining sheep numbers.\n\nAustralia \u2014 the source of most of the sheep jokes about New Zealanders \u2014 is also home to more sheep than people, but the national flock is shrinking too.\n\nThe gap is slimmer: There are about three sheep per Australian.",

    "text": "US President Donald Trump has agreed to cut tariffs on UK vehicles, steel and aluminium in a planned trade deal with Britain, which would buy more American beef and streamline its customs process for goods from the US.\n\nThe symbolically resonant agreement announced on Thursday (early Friday AEST) still has yet to be finalised, but it suggested that Trump was still able to negotiate with other countries after his vast set of tariffs stoked fears around the world of an economic downturn and higher inflation.\n\nThe announcement provided a political victory for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and offered a degree of validation for Trump's claims that his turbulent approach on trade may be able to rebalance the global economy on his preferred terms.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks on the phone to Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer on a trade deal between the US and United Kingdom in the Oval Office of the White House, on Thursday, May 8, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nThe US president talked up the agreement to reporters from the Oval Office, even as the fine print remained in flux despite his prior statements that a full agreement was signed.\n\n\"The final details are being written up,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"In the coming weeks, we'll have it all very conclusive.\"\n\nThe president said that the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the UK, which would also streamline the processing of US goods through customs.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the baseline 10 per cent tariffs would stay in place, while UK officials said that Trump's auto tariffs would go from 27.5 per cent to 10 per cent on a quota of 100,000 vehicles and the import taxes on steel and aluminium would go from 25 per cent to zero.\n\nTrump cautioned that the agreement with its preservation of a 10 per cent tariff was not a template for other countries pursuing possible trade deals with the US.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks on the phone to US President Donald Trump at a car factory in the West Midlands, Thursday, May 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali, Pool)\n\nHe said he intends to charge higher rates on other countries as part of any agreement \u2014 a sign that the import taxes could stay in place in ways that economists warn would reduce economic growth.\n\n\"That's a low number,\" Trump said of his 10 per cent tariff rate.\n\nStarmer, speaking over the phone to Trump, stressed the importance of the relationship between the two countries as the anniversary of the World War II victory in Europe was being commemorated.\n\n\"To be able to announce this great deal on the same deal 80 years forward, almost at the same hour and as we were 80 years ago with the UK and the US standing side by side, I think is incredibly important,\" Starmer said.\n\nStarmer later spoke to workers at a Jaguar Land Rover plant and touted the deal, which he said would protect thousands of auto jobs. He told the workers \"this is just the start\".\n\nShipping containers wait to be processed at London Gateway port, in Stanford-le-Hope, on the Thames estuary east of London, England, Wednesday, February 5, 2025. (AP Photo, File)\n\n\"We are hammering out further details to reduce barriers to trade with the United States and across the world,\" he said.\n\nThe planned deal was the first outlined since Trump began his stutter-step efforts to rewire the global economy by dramatically increasing import taxes in an attempt to increase domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Republican president quickly rolled out tariffs after returning to the White House, targeting traditional allies such as the UK with import taxes on steel, aluminium and autos.\n\nTrump announced near universal tariffs on April 2, then partially retreated a week later and announced that his administration would seek individual agreements with various countries over the next few months.\n\nSteel rods produced at the Gerdau Ameristeel mill in St Paul, Minnesota, await shipment, May 9, 2019. (AP Photo/Jim Mone, File)\n\nThe US already runs a trade surplus with the UK, making it a bit easier to find common ground as Trump has staked his tariffs on specifically eliminating the annual trade deficits with multiple nations he says have taken advantage of the US.\n\nNo new deals have been reached with America's largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Trump has left the highest tariffs in place on China, sparking a confrontation between the world's two biggest economies. Washington and Beijing are sending officials to Switzerland this weekend for an initial round of trade talks.\n\nTrump promised on Thursday that there are \"many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"\n\nThe US and the UK have been aiming to strike a bilateral trade agreement since the British people voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, allowing the country to negotiate independently of the rest of the continent. Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted a future deal with the US as an incentive for Brexit.\n\nNegotiations started in 2020, during Trump's first term. But the talks made little progress under The-President Joe Biden, a Democrat and a critic of Brexit. Negotiations resumed after Trump returned to office in January and intensified in recent weeks.\n\nCelebrity Trump supporters now turning on the US president View Gallery\n\nA major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the import tax on UK cars and steel, which Trump set at 25 per cent. The US is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of UK auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nBritain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the US wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products.\n\nStarmer's government has said it won't lower UK food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.\n\nThe British government will see a deal as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain did not announce retaliatory tariffs on US goods in response to Trump's import taxes.\n\nA trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.\n\nThe US ran a $US11.9 billion ($18.5 billion) trade surplus in goods with the UK last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $US68 billion ($105.9 billion) in goods that the US imported from the UK last year accounted for just 2 per cent of all goods imported into the country.\n\nThe US is much more important to the UK economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the US are services rather than goods.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives on Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Sunday, May 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (AP)\n\nTrump has previously said that his leverage in talks would be US consumers, but he appeared to suggest that the UK would also start buying more American-made goods.\n\n\"I think that the United Kingdom, like every other country, they want to ... go shopping in the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nA trade deal with the US is one of several that Starmer's government is seeking to strike. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade agreement after three years of negotiations.\n\nThe UK is also trying to lift some of the barriers to trade with the EU imposed when Britain left the bloc in 2020.",

    "text": "The British and Irish Lions squad has been announced for the upcoming tour of Australia, ending months of speculation about who would be named.\n\nThe 38-strong touring party features 15 Ireland players, 13 from England, eight from Scotland and just two from Wales.\n\nEngland's lock and two-time Lions tourist Maro Itoje is captain.\n\nCoach Andy Farrell, the Englishman in charge of Ireland, had some desperately tough choices to make, but has selected a very strong squad to tour Down Under.\n\nHere's the list of players rugby fans will become acquainted with over the next couple of months.\n\nForwards\n\nProp: Zander Fagerson (SCO) Zander Fagerson. ( ) Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 75 caps (3 tries) | 4 appearances on 2021 tour, 0 caps 29yo, Perth, SCO | 188cm/126kg A Glasgow Warriors stalwart, Fagerson is one of the most-reliable performers in Scotland's ever-improving side. Never one to take a backward step, the west coast product is the sort of player that you want to have in your side, which is where he will likely be if there's any possibility of things getting out of hand. However, a calf injury he suffered in the lead-up to Glasgow's URC match against Zebra did put his touring participation in doubt, with Warriors coach Franco Smith telling reporters that the issue would rule him out until late June. Prop: Tadhg Furlong (IRE) Tadhg Furlong. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 79 caps (5 tries) | 6 Lions Test caps 32yo, Wexford, IRE | 183cm/119kg Tadhg Furlong is one of the premier tight head props in the world, so there was never a doubt that he would be named to his third Lions touring team. Or was there? The 32-year-old missed all but one of Ireland's underwhelming Six Nations campaign and its entire series of autumn internationals with troublesome hamstring and calf injuries, playing just 33 minutes of international rugby since July last year. Battling these re-occurring injuries has been tough and there has to be an acceptance that his body is not capable of the repeat efforts it was in his 20s. But this monster of a presence in the front row has earned his spot on tour despite the lack of game time in recent months and will likely be a pillar of strength come Test time too. Prop: Ellis Genge (ENG) Ellis Genge. ( ) Bristol Bears & England | 71 caps (5 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Bristol, ENG | 187cm/116kg Ellis Genge is passion personified in an England shirt \u2014 and you'd expect the Bristolian to bring all and that and more Down Under with the Lions as well. A man who walks the walk as much as he talks the talk, Genge is as mobile as they come and a hugely impressive scrummager to boot, adding yet another mark to the Lions' impressive scrum stocks on this tour \u2014 in 2022 he was named World Rugby loosehead prop of the year. Genge scored one of his rare international tries against the Wallabies in Perth in 2022, albeit in a 28-30 defeat, but will have happy memories of that tour as Eddie Jones's tourists secured a 2-1 series victory. Prop: Andrew Porter (IRE) Andrew Porter. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 75 caps (6 tries) | Named to tour in 2021 29yo, Dublin, IRE | 183cm/123kg One of the hardest-working players on the field, Leinster stalwart Andrew Porter was tireless throughout Ireland's Six Nations campaign. He hit 99 rucks \u2014 22 more than any other prop \u2014 and made 52 tackles in the Championship \u2014 one of just two props to pass 50. Porter was named to tour with the Lions in 2021 but did not make it to South Africa after suffering a toe injury in the lead-up. He will see this as being an opportunity to make up for lost time and the missed opportunity that got away from him through no fault of his own four years ago. Prop: Pierre Schoeman (SCO) Pierre Schoeman. ( ) Edinburgh & Scotland | 42 caps (6 tries) | Lions tour debut 31yo, Mbombela, RSA | 180cm/118kg One of Scotland's South Africa-born contingent, Schoeman has confirmed himself as one of Scotland's key performers as Gregor Townsend's boys raised themselves into the conversation. A former Springbok U20 international and ex-skipper of the Springbok schoolboys team, Schoeman made his debut for Scotland in 2021 after qualifying on residency grounds, having moved to Edinburgh in 2018. A monster at scrum time and devastating in the loose, it's easy to see why Schoeman is a fan favourite north of Hadrian's Wall and could be in with a very decent shout of wearing the number one jersey in Brisbane when the first Test comes around. Prop: Will Stuart (ENG) Will Stuart. ( ) Bath & England | 50 caps (3 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, London, ENG | 189cm/127kg Will Stuart is dangerous in the loose as well as solid at scrum time. ( ) Will Stuart had a superb Six Nations campaign for England, pushing his case with a number of assured displays. Given that the tight-head was under enormous pressure to keep his spot in the England team after a very disappointing tour of New Zealand that saw him left off the list of centrally contracted players, his resurgence has been all the more impressive. Starting at the back end of 2024, England's scrum has gone from strength-to-strength, devastating their opponents in the close confines of hand-to-hand combat that typifies the tight five. An ancient history buff who acknowledges he's happier with a lower profile than some of his front row partners, Stuart is a deserving tourist and should make his mark in the Test team. Hooker: Luke Cowan-Dickie (ENG) Luke Cowan-Dickie. ( ) Sale Sharks & Ireland | 49 caps (9 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 31yo, Truro, ENG | 183cm/111kg The Cornish hooker started out life in rugby as a prop before moving into the centre of the front row, where he excelled for both club and country. It's not been an easy path though, even accounting for the fact that he had former captain Jamie George to contend with for the number two jersey for England. After being one of the best hookers in the world through 2021, injury forced Cowan-Dickie to undergo neck surgery in 2023 that affected nerves in his arm for over a year. He then had a scare during a match for Sale when his heart skipped a beat \u2026 atrial fibrillation. A two-time Six Nations winner and a member of the 2019 Rugby World Cup squad that finished as runner-up, Cowan-Dickie has since given up drinking and playing Call of Duty \u2014 a game for which he was ranked as number one in the world for a short time. Hooker: R\u00f3nan Kelleher (IRE) R\u00f3nan Kelleher. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 39 caps (8 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 27yo, Dublin, IRE | 185cm/111kg A tourist in 2021, initially as non-travelling cover but eventually as a full-blown replacement, Kelleher's inclusion says as much about Leinster's strength in depth as it does his own abilities. Indeed, ABC Sport had Kelleher as the best-performing hooker through the first two rounds of this year's Six Nations, before Sheehan returned from injury and was judged best for the final three weeks of the campaign. When Dan Sheehan suffered a season-ending knee injury in 2024, Kelleher was a more than ample replacement for both club and country. The two twos may as well come as a package deal and will continue to share duties at all levels. Hooker: Dan Sheehan (IRE) Dan Sheehan. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 32 caps (15 tries) | Lions tour debut 26yo, Dublin, IRE | 191cm/111kg The most-prolific try-scoring forward in Six Nations history, Sheehan crossed the line five times in the course of the Championship this year, including a hat-trick against Italy. The Dublin lad has had his share of setbacks in his career, including an ACL injury in 2024, but never let that get him down. His return to the Leinster side saw him score two tries against the Stormers and he stepped up to captain Ireland during this year's Six Nations in the absence of Caelan Doris. A reliable lineout thrower and busier than any in the loose, Sheehan had stamped his ticket to Australia long before the squad was eventually named. Lock: Tadhg Beirne (IRE) Tadhg Beirne. ( ) Munster & Ireland | 61 caps (12 tries) | 2 Lions Test caps (2021) 33yo, Eadestown, Co Kildare, IRE | 198cm/113kg The Munster skipper made his international bow for Ireland's senior team against Australia in 2018, helping the squad to a historic 2-1 victory. In fact, in three Tests against Australia for Ireland he has never been on the losing side. The ex-Leinster and Scarlets man will be hoping for something similar when he dons the red of the British and Irish Lions. A stellar performer who can also play in the back row if required, Beirne has twice been named in the World Rugby men's team of the year in the second row. During the Six Nations, Beirne and Andrew Porter both received abuse for an incident that saw Antoine Dupont rupture his ACL, with France coach Fabien Galthie particularly passionate. However, Beirne was adamant that there was no malice and it was just an unfortunate incident at a clean-out of a ruck. Lock: Ollie Chessum (ENG) Ollie Chessum. ( ) Leicester Tigers & England | 28 caps (2 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Boston, ENG | 201cm/118kg Following an 11-month injury lay-off, Ollie Chessum was brought straight back into England's Six Nations squad, underlining the high esteem the Lincolnshire man is held by Steve Borthwick \u2014 who should know a thing or two about being an international lock. Chessum's reaction to those back-to-back injuries to his shoulder and knee impressed his Australian coach at Leicester, Michael Cheika, who praised his attitude to rehab. A giant of a man, Chessum has been a feature of England's second row but can also be used in the back row if required. Lock: Scott Cummins (SCO) Scott Cummins. ( ) Glasgow Warriors & Scoland | 42 caps (2 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 26yo, Glasgow, SCO | 198cm/116kg Capped at almost every level by Scotland, Cummins was first selected in the senior squad by Gregor Townsend in 2017 but did not make his debut in the senior team until 2019. A long wait, but worth it for the Glaswegian, who has since made himself an integral member of the Scotland side. Cummins was in the spotlight in 2024 when he was sent off against South Africa for an innocuous-looking clean-out at a ruck. His absence from the squad through a broken arm for the 2025 edition was keenly felt for a Scotland team that somewhat stalled in their development. Lock | Captain: Maro Itoje (ENG) Maro Itoje. ( ) Saracens & England | 93 caps (8 tries) | 6 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 30yo, London, ENG | 195cm/118kg Maro Itoje was once again immense for England. ( ) A man writing himself into the history books as one of England's all-time greats. Itoje, named skipper of England for this year's Championships, was the only man to play in every minute of every game as England managed a heartening second-place finish behind France. A man who leads by example, whose performances simply demand respect whether it's for Saracens, England, or the Lions. This will be his third Lions tour and, given he has played in every Test on the previous two tours he's been on with the Lions, expect his name to be among the first on the team sheet this time around as well and add his list to the great locks of the past, like Willie John McBride and Alun Wyn Jones. Lock: Joe McCarthy (IRE) Joe McCarthy. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 93 caps (8 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Manhattan, USA | 198cm/124kg One of Ireland and Leinster's key performers in the second row over the last few years, McCarthy is a giant of a man who made his international debut against the Wallabies in 2022. He didn't have the most impactful Six Nations campaign, but has been impressive domestically for Leinster. Discipline is going to be a hot topic on tour, and one that McCarthy will need to be careful about. In a later match against the Wallabies, the New York-born, Ireland-raised lock left quite the impression on Rob Valetini in Dublin last year, when he clashed heads with the Aussie forward only to escape punishment from the officials. McCarthy was penalised with a sin-binning though for pulling back Thomas Ramos in Dublin during the Six Nations, which allowed the French to capitalise and run away with the win. It was a rare card for a team that had taken great pride in its discipline over the past few years and the sort of issue teams cannot afford to give away in tight Test matches. Lock: James Ryan (IRE) James Ryan. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 72 caps (5 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Blackrock, Co Dublin, Ireland | 203cm/124kg Another monster of a lock who has been a stalwart in the Leinster and Ireland back row for a number of years. In fact, current Wallabies coach Joe Schimdt thought so highly of Ryan that he handed him his full international debut before he had suited up for Leinster, becoming the first player since 2012 to play for his country before his province. His inclusion was vindicated \u2014 he scored a try on debut. Many of the squad have leadership credentials and Ryan is no exception, captaining the Ireland under 20s to a runners-up finish at the 2016 world championship \u2014 Ireland's best-ever position. His talkative nature to referees eventually led to him being replaced, but don't expect that will stop him from muttering a few words out on the field. Backrow: Jack Conan (IRE) Jack Conan. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 72 caps (13 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 32yo, Bray, Co Wicklow, Ireland | 193cm/124kg A fixture of the Leinster team for more than a decade, Conan is an immense runner in the loose, who is also a furious presence in defence, earning the joint-highest number of turnovers of anyone in the Ireland squad throughout the Six Nations despite mostly playing off the bench. Comfortable anywhere in the back three, he scored tries against Scotland, Wales and France, as well as being a key factor in the second-half surge that accounted for England. It is off the bench where Conan can be most effective, acknowledging that during the week being a squad member in modern rugby is vital. Another player who has had to return from almost a year out of the game \u2014 in part due to missing the 2024 summer tour for the arrival of his first child \u2014 Conan suffered a shoulder injury in the Six Nations but he has since recovered. Backrow: Tom Curry (ENG) Tom Curry. ( ) Sale Sharks & England | 61 caps (6 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 26yo, London, ENG | 185cm/109kg There were very few players who performed as consistently well throughout the Six Nations as Tom Curry. Starting every game for England, his stunning work rate in both attack and defence were impossible to ignore by anyone watching. Perhaps most impressively though was the stunning display he produced in Cardiff, where he embarrassed his opposite number and Lions jersey frontrunner Jac Morgan in a devastating display, all in front of coach Andy Farrell. Don't back against him adding to his three Lions caps despite the impossible strength in depth of the back row across the British Isles. Backrow: Ben Earl (ENG) Ben Earl. ( ) Saracens & England | 42 caps (6 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 27yo, Redhill, ENG | 183cm/107kg Another of the stellar England backrow unit who simply doesn't know what fatigue is \u2014 or at least plays that way. No England player had more carries than Earl through the Six Nations, with the Saracens man taking all 63 of them into contact \u2014 second only to Blair Kinghorne in his propensity to hit tacklers. Earl also made more tackles than any other England player, no mean feat given how the entire loose forward contingent hunted in packs. He also stole five balls at the breakdown, equal most of all England players with Ben Curry, and made a turnover tackle as well. You know what you're going to get if you pick Ben Earl, a whirlwind of power and willingness. Backrow: Jac Morgan (WAL) Jac Morgan. ( ) Ospreys & Wales | 24 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 25yo, Swansea, WAL | 182cm/105kg By the end of the Six Nations, Wales skipper Jac Morgan looked absolutely exhausted. Jac Morgan is by far Wales' best player. ( ) That's understandable. He had played every minute of Wales's sorry campaign, making more tackles (92) than anyone else in the tournament, hitting more rucks than anyone bar Gregory Alldritt and doing it all while carrying his misfiring teammates on his back. It would not have gone unnoticed that Morgan had his worst display of the tournament in the humiliation at the hands of England in Cardiff, where he was comprehensively outplayed by his direct opponent for a Lions starting berth, Ben Curry. Wales has a fine heritage when it comes to the Lions, and although the number of tourists from Wales is paltry compared to recent years, in Morgan they have at least provided one of the best. Backrow: Henry Pollock (ENG) Henry Pollock. ( ) Northampton Saints & England | 1 cap (2 tries) | Lions tour debut 20yo, Banbury, ENG | 186cm/100kg Get used to this name, because it's one you're going to be hearing a lot of in rugby circles over the next few years. Bruising and combative back row forwards are 10-a-penny in rugby union, and yet there is still something a little bit special about this youngster. Having captained England at under 18 and under 20 level \u2014 the latter of which saw him lift the 2024 under 20 Rugby World Championship \u2014 Pollock roared into senior team contention after starring for England A against Australia in London in November last year. He made his senior debut off the bench in Cardiff as England romped to a belting victory against their arch nemesis, with Pollock scoring twice. His display against Leinster in Dublin for the Saints showed that he loves the limelight, laying down tackles on his senior rivals and scoring a wonderful try that embarrassed Sam Prendergast to such an extent that it may have been the deciding moment that saw him missing the trip. Every tour needs a bolter and Pollock has proven with his stellar performances this year that he is more than up to the task. Backrow: Josh van der Flier (IRE) Josh van der Flier. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 73 caps (13 tries) | Lions tour debut 32yo, Wicklow, IRE | 186cm/103kg Despite the name suggesting otherwise, Josh van der Flier is not one of the South African exiles playing in Europe. In fact, he's of Dutch stock, and was born and raised in Wicklow south of Dublin. A keen thinker \u2014 he has a masters degree from Dublin Business School \u2014 van der Flier has been one of Ireland's best for a number of years, winning the World Rugby player of the year award in 2022 and being named player of the series for the 2024 November internationals. Nobody in an Ireland shirt made more tackles than him in the Six Nations, nor hit as many rucks as he did.\n\nBacks\n\nScrum half: Jamison Gibson-Park (IRE) Jamison Gibson-Park. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 43 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 33yo, Great Barrier Island, NZ | 175cm/80kg A player who cut his teeth playing for Taranaki in the National Provincial Championships across the ditch, Jamison Gibson-Park was considered one of the rising stars of New Zealand rugby. As a 20-year-old he was selected for the M\u0101ori All Blacks in 2012, before going on to play Super Rugby for the Blues and Hurricanes. Staying in New Zealand though, was not Gibson-Park's destiny, as he would move to Dublin in 2016, becoming eligible for Ireland on residency grounds in 2019. He made his Ireland debut in 2020 and has since been awarded citizenship. A shoe-in for the number nine jersey, Gibson-Park started the Six Nations brightly against England, but frankly dropped off as the tournament progressed. The Lions will want and need him on top form if they are to succeed Down Under. Scrum half: Alex Mitchell (ENG) Alex Mitchell. ( ) Northampton Saints & England | 23 caps (4 tries) | Lions tour debut 27yo, Maidstone, ENG | 178cm/89kg An exciting, running scrum half, Alex Mitchell was involved in five tries for England in the Six Nations, second most behind Northampton teammate Tommy Freeman. And yet it is his form for Northampton that has undoubtedly got the 27-year-old Kent man on the plane. Against Leinster last week he was exceptional, leading the Saints to an unlikely European final. With Northampton providing four tourists, expect Mitchell to use his relationship with Fin Smith on the midweek team to great effect and work to get into that Test team. Scrum half: Tomos Williams (WAL) Tomos Williams. ( ) Gloucester & Wales | 60 caps (10 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Treorchy, WAL | 180cm/86kg There's no hiding from Wales's abysmal Six Nations campaign, but among the ashes of a once fine rugby nation, Tomos Williams still flickered. From the former mining region of the Rhondda Fawr Valley, Williams will be upholding Welsh pride on tour alongside his country skipper Jac Morgan. Given Wales's fine history with the Lions, there's no wonder he admitted to shedding a tear when he heard he had made the squad. A darting runner who honed his speed of foot and mind on the sevens circuit, the ex-Cardiff man will relish having a pack in front of him that's not going backwards at a rate of knots when he suits up for the Lions. Fly half: Finn Russell (SCO) Finn Russell. ( ) Bath & Scotland | 85 caps (415pts, 9 tries) | 1 Lions Test cap 32yo, Stirling, SCO | 182cm/87kg Mercurial. Established. Flashy. Take your pick of adjectives to describe Finn Russell. But one thing you can be sure of is his will to win. In a Six Nations tournament filled with young pretenders for the Lions 10 shirt, Russell could be considered a safe pair of hands \u2014 although the veteran did have his moments with some careless play against Ireland and some terrible goal-kicking against England. Despite those lapses Scotland has, under his guidance, developed one of the best attacking back lines in the world, albeit one that did not quite have the cutting edge he or coach Gregor Townsend would have hoped for during the Northern Hemisphere spring. He is the top scorer in the Premiership for Bath, with 148 points (five penalties, 59 conversions and three tries), which should be an indication his ability off the tee has not been dulled. With even more weapons at his disposal and a brutally strong pack ahead of him, what could Russell do for the Lions? We may not have to wonder too long. Fly half: Fin Smith (ENG) Fin Smith. ( ) Northampton Saints & England | 11 caps (29pts) | Lions tour debut 22yo, Warwick, ENG | 178cm/87kg Fin Smith had a man of the match performance. ( ) Just a couple of months ago nobody would have thought Fin Smith would be anything other than deserving of a cursory mention when it came to the British and Irish Lions squad \u2014 perhaps only in passing as reference to his grandfather, Tom Elliot, the Scotland prop who played eight tour games but no Tests on the 1955 Lions tour of South Africa. Yet, after a superb Six Nations and a series of magical performances for the Saints in both the Premiership and European Cup competition, young Fin forced himself into the conversation. Having been named in the Premiership team of the season and the Players Association players' player of the year in 2023/24 should have been a clue as to the trajectory his career was on, but managing to convert that domestic form into the international stage was something else. His performances up against fellow young gun, Sam Prendergast would have made a particular impression on the selection team just last week when the youngster helped guide the Saints to a hugely unexpected victory over Leinster at the Aviva Stadium in the European Cup semifinal. Fly half: Marcus Smith (ENG) Marcus Smith. ( ) Harlequins & England | 44 caps (14 tries, 314pts) | Lions tourist in 2021 26yo, Manila, PHI | 175cm/82kg Marcus Smith and Fin Smith will both be on the plane. ( ) One of the most thrilling broken-play players in world rugby, Marcus Smith should, perhaps, feel a little fortunate that he has been included in this Lions squad. A year ago you'd have said the Harlequins man was a nailed-on starter for both the Lions and England, but with the rise of Fin Smith and a shift to fullback at international level, Marcus's stock has fallen. And yet, despite a dramatic drop-off in club form of late, there are few players in the world who can incite as much excitement as Smith does when he has his hands on the ball. Whether he plays at 15 or 10 on tour, given the amount of ball the Lions will be expected to have, he could make hay against any opponent, with his versatility potentially making him an ideal bench player for the Test team. Centre: Bundee Aki (IRE) Bundee Aki. ( ) Connacht & Ireland | 65 caps (18 tries) | 1 Lions Test cap 35yo, \u014ct\u0101huhu, NZ | 178cm/102kg It's easy to think of Bundee Aki as another of New Zealand's rugby refugees now plying his trade in Europe, but the 35-year-old veteran is so much more than that. Moving from the Chiefs fresh after winning Super Rugby to unfashionable Connacht out on Ireland's windswept west coast, Aki made the Westerners a genuine title force and even helped them win the Pro12 in 2015. As Ireland has surged, so has Aki, winning two grand slams and three Six Nations titles in total since he made his debut in 2017, after completing his three years of residency. Aki was criticised earlier in his career after admitting that he moved to Ireland primarily to play international rugby, but has embraced life so comprehensively in Galway that he has become a citizen in 2024. \"I love the people, I love the culture \u2026 There's not a bad word I can speak about Ireland,\" Aki said upon being made a citizen. Centre: Elliot Daly (ENG) Eliot Daly. ( ) Saracens & England | 65 caps (131 points, 18 tries) | 5 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 32yo, Croydon, ENG | 178cm/83kg He's listed as a centre, but in reality Elliot Daly can play just about anywhere in the back line. Immense under the high ball and a brutal attacking force, Daly will likely slot in at fullback as often as he will in the centres. His enormous boot, capable of kicking penalty goals from beyond half way, may also prove vital. Another of the backs in this squad to be in the incredibly small group of players who have played both for and against the touring side. In 2023, Daly played for the Barbarians who took on the touring Lions in Hong Kong. Since then he has gone on to play five Tests, including all three in the dramatic drawn series against New Zealand in 2021. Centre: Huw Jones (SCO) Huw Jones. ( ) Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 58 caps (23 tries) | Lions tour debut 31yo, Leith, SCO | 186cm/102kg Scotland to England to South Africa to Scotland and now the Lions \u2014 Huw Jones's rugby life has already taken him plenty of places around the world. Born in Scotland, Jones was educated in England before moving to South Africa, where he got his first taste of professional rugby with Western Province and then the Stormers in Super Rugby. The call of home was always there though and he moved to the Glasgow Warriors where, either side of a season at Harlequins, he has remained ever since. A hard-running and skilful ball carrier whose ability to unpick a defence with lines few can see let alone defend against, Jones has been one of the stars in a backline full of them for the Scots in recent years \u2014 particularly in partnership with former Australian Sione Tuipulotu. Although he has not played since the Six Nations on account of an ankle injury, he had plenty of credit in the bank to keep his spot in the squad. Centre: Garry Ringrose (IRE) Garry Ringrose. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 67 caps (77 points, 15 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Blackrock, Co Dublin, IRE | 185cm/102kg A fleet-of-foot centre who has been a fixture in the Ireland set-up since 2016, Gary Ringrose is a multiple winner at club and international level. One of the most skilled ball-handlers in the game, Ringrose has the ability to unlock defences with a hint of a swerve as much as a powerful fend. Being sent off for a high tackle against Wales \u2014 and a subsequent three-match ban \u2014 limited his international appearances this season. But there was little concern that Andy Farrell would leave one of his most dependable backs at home. Centre: Sione Tuipulotu (SCO) Sione Tuipulotu. ( ) Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 58 caps (23 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Melbourne, AUS | 179cm/104kg The Melbourne Rebels are, sadly, no more, but they will be represented in some small way at least on this year's Lions tour. A graduate of the Rebels set-up, Sione Tuipulotu felt like his Lions dream was over after he suffered a pectoral injury in January that has kept him out of action until May. Fortunately, Andy Farrell had already seen enough from this adopted Scot, who qualified for the tartan army on account of his grandmother. And it's a fitting reward for what has been a stunning rise for the Australian-born centre, who has inarguably been the heart and soul of Scotland's rise into genuine contenders in recent years as captain. In November, Tuipulotu clashed with Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, so that might be one to keep an eye on Down Under. Wing: Tommy Freeman (ENG) Tommy Freeman. ( ) Northampton & England | 20 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Oxford, ENG | 188cm/92kg Tommy Freeman made history during the 2025 Six Nations, becoming the first Englishman to score a try in each round of fixtures \u2014 even if the legitimacy of the try awarded against Scotland at Twickenham is justifiably contested north of the border. One of the rising stars of England rugby, Freeman combines powerful running with electric speed and finishing ability \u2014 everything you could ask for from a winger, in other words. Overall he has 16 tries from 17 starts for Northampton, and five in nine for England this season. He made his starting debut for England at Lang Park in 2022 under Eddie Jones, perhaps he'll make his Lions debut there too. Wing: Mack Hansen (IRE) Mack Hansen. ( ) Connacht & Ireland | 28 caps (12 tries) | Lions tour debut 27yo, Canberra, AUS | 188cm/89kg Mack Hansen suffered an ankle injury that will force him to miss the last few rounds of the United Rugby Championship, which must have meant he feared for his spot on this year's Lions tour, especially given the impressive form of Scotland's Darcy Graham. He needn't have worried, despite professing to being \"speechless\" for the first time in his life. Despite not having the most prolific of Six Nations tournaments, the Australian-born winger with an Irish mother has been a key member of Andy Farrell's back line for Ireland and was, if not a certainty for selection, a pretty safe bet. Hansen was one of the first players interviewed after the squad was announced, telling the event at the O2 via Zoom that he had just been about to go for a swim on Ireland's west coast. In May. You can take the boy out of Australia \u2026 Wing: James Lowe (IRE) James Lowe. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 40 caps (17 tries) | Lions tour debut 32yo, Nelson, NZ | 188cm/101kg Not many players will have played both against the British and Irish Lions as well as for them, but that's a rare honour that James Lowe will likely achieve this tour. Lowe first played against the Lions in 2017, when he appeared at fullback for the M\u0101ori All Blacks in their 32-10 defeat against the Lions in Rotorua. That was the last of Lowe's eight caps for the M\u0101ori. Fast forward eight years and Lowe has 40 international appearances for Ireland under his belt and a reputation as one of the most dangerously powerful wingers in the world. Wing: Duhan van der Merwe (SCO) Duhan van der Merwe. ( ) Edinburgh & Scotland | 49 caps (32 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps 29yo, George, RSA | 193cm/106kg Nothing short of a try-scoring machine he may be, but Duhan van der Merwe does have his critics, summarised succinctly by Rugby World this week: \"Some may argue that Duhan van de Merwe doesn\u2019t offer enough \u2018without\u2019 the ball,\" wrote columnist and author Paul Williams. \"But that\u2019s much like criticising a nuclear weapon because all it does is blow things up.\" It's a fair enough statement. This monstrous winger tore up the record books as a kid in the Western Cape, earning a spot as part of the South Africa squad that finished runners-up at the 2014 Junior World Championship. A move to Montpellier in 2016 didn't really work out, but shifting north to Edinburgh proved the trick, with the club signing him despite question marks over a hip injury. Injury is clouding him in the lead-up to this Lions Tour, an ankle injury requiring surgery has kept him out the Edinburgh line up since March. Fullback: Hugo Keenan (IRE) Hugo Keenan. ( ) Leinster & Ireland | 46 caps (13 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Dublin, IRE | 185cm/92kg A Paris 2024 Olympian with the Ireland Sevens team, Hugo Keenan displays all the skills needed to break lines and tackles at will in the 15s game as well. Equally capable at fullback or the wing, Keenan is super capable under the high ball and is very dangerous in broken play \u2014 kicking to him is ill-advised. Another of Leinster's bevvy of stars who will line up for the Lions \u2014 12 of the touring squad play in the blue of Leinster. Fullback: Blair Kinghorn (SCO) Blair Kinghorn. ( ) Stade Toulousain & Scotland | 60 caps (146 pts, 16 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Edinburgh, SCO | 193cm/107kg The stand out 15 of the home nations during the past Six Nations, nothing would stop Blair Kinghorn being named in this squad. That's despite him likely to miss at least the first tour match in Perth against the Force due to Toulouse's Top14 finals commitments.

    "text": "A 31-year-old deputy mayor and mother of three has resigned from her regional council claiming it was costing her money to represent her community.\n\nEllie Tree announced she was stepping down from Bellingen Shire Council on the New South Wales Mid North Coast after a three-month leave of absence.\n\nShe said she was unable to balance the workload between family, full-time employment and postgraduate study.\n\n\"Unfortunately council pays the least and takes up the most of my time,\" Cr Tree said.\n\n\"People that step into the role aren't doing it for the money, it's a passion.\n\n\" I was having to take days of leave without pay to attend council meetings and it ended up costing me money to be a councillor. \"\n\n'Sad indictment of local government'\n\nWomen under 40 make up only 6 per cent of councillors according to the latest report on councillor diversity from the NSW Office of Local Government.\n\nIn NSW, councillors are paid an annual fee instead of a salary, which is determined by the Local Government Remuneration Tribunal.\n\nWhile mayors in cities can earn six-figure salaries, councillors earn as little as $10,220.\n\nCr Tree told the ABC she was paid $18,000 per year for her work on the Bellingen council.\n\nCr Tree's kids would often accompany her to council events. (Supplied: Bellingen Shire Council)\n\nAfter being re-elected in 2024, Cr Tree unsuccessfully pushed to change the time of council meetings from 9:45am to sometime in the evening.\n\n\"When you're in a position such as mine where you need to take days off your full-time job to attend meetings, [the pay] dwindled down to about $6,000 a year in your back pocket,\" Cr Tree said.\n\nBellingen Mayor Steve Allan said Cr Tree had made a huge contribution to the local community and it was disappointing she had to resign.\n\n\"It's a very difficult ask of a young, working mother to be able to fulfil the role of councillor while working full-time and looking after a family,\" Cr Allan said.\n\n\" It's a sad indictment on the structure of local government in NSW. \"\n\nBarriers to participation\n\nAs more women than ever enter politics at the federal level, structural barriers like low pay remain for those looking to cut their teeth in local politics in NSW.\n\nAccording to analysis from the Australian Local Government Women's Association, women's representation on councils across Australia has grown to 40 per cent.\n\nLocal Government NSW president Phyllis Miller said despite the improved representation, the poor pay and heavy workload for councillors meant mostly older, semi-retired people were putting their hands up to be involved.\n\n\"If we don't start to change the fee structure, we're going to end up with people at retirement age being the only people who can afford to stand for local government,\" Cr Miller said.\n\nPhyllis Miller says local government's pay and workload mean mostly older, semi-retired people are involved. (Supplied)\n\nCr Miller said Local Government NSW was continuing to lobby the state government for increased funding and support for councillors.\n\n\"We go to the remuneration tribunal every year and we get nothing,\" she said.\n\n\"In Queensland, you get 85 per cent of a backbencher's salary, so the councillors would be on $70,000-80,000 a year.\n\n\" I don't think politicians realise our workload is every bit as big as theirs. \"\n\nCr Tree, who was the youngest councillor in Bellingen Shire's history when she was first elected in 2021, said despite her resignation she hoped to stay engaged in the community.\n\n\"Right now, I just think my time is better off spent with my kids and focusing on my full-time employment,\" she said.\n\n\"Will I run again? Maybe when I'm old and semi-retired.\"",

(Supplied)\n\nWhen she did speak, Ms Hunter said her grief would often be \"minimised\".\n\n\"People will kind of say, 'But you didn't know them so you wouldn't really understand what grief or what loss is,'\" she said.\n\n\" There's this hole that is kind of unexplained because that loss is more of a somatic or physical experience. \"\n\nMs Hunter, pictured with her husband Ed, says people have tried to minimise her grief over the years. (Supplied: Morgan Hunter)\n\nHonouring her mum's memory\n\nMs Hunter is one of 3.9 million Australian women who have lost their mum, with 1.2 million experiencing the profound loss before the age of 44.\n\nA few years ago, she discovered advocacy group Motherless Daughters Australia.\n\nMs Hunter says talking about and remembering her mother and family has helped her immensely. (Supplied)\n\n\"It's been such a humanising experience, it's made me feel like there are people out there who just get it,\" she said.\n\nThe group has also transformed the way she now deals with her grief.\n\n\"For a long time, I didn't have any rituals. It's something I'm starting to build and develop,\" she said.\n\n\"I read through her [Kerrie's] journals on days of significance, like her birthday or on Mother's Day, I'll try and really lean into that connection and try and understand her.\n\n\"I will light a candle. I might make a recipe from her recipe book to try and eat something that she enjoyed.\"\n\nMs Hunter says being able to talk to other woman who have lost their mothers has been life-changing for her. (Supplied)\n\nShe said finally talking about her mother had brought her a lot of comfort.\n\n\"She is described as being born to be a mum \u2026 incredibly nurturing and really aware of her kids and what they loved and was always trying to make every single day a special experience,\" she said.\n\n\" The way that people talk, it's apparent Mum had such a big place in a lot of people's lives, she made such a mark in a really beautiful way. \"\n\nReclaiming the day\n\nDanielle Snelling co-founded Motherless Daughters Australia in 2013, after losing her mum Rosa to a rare gynaecological cancer.\n\nMs Snelling said it was important to remember the origins of Mother's Day, which was founded in 1905 by Anna Jarvis, after the American's mother Ann died.\n\nDanielle Snelling hopes to normalise discussions about grief to help bereaved daughters. (Supplied: Motherless Daughters Australia)\n\n\"That helps women in our community have a sense of ownership on the day \u2026 to feel that they can very much partake in Mother's Day, and the day actually exists through a daughter grieving her mum,\" Ms Snelling said.\n\n\"This year, our campaign is focusing on educating people that grief's not brief.\n\n\"Whether you lost your mum a year ago, six months ago or 20 years ago, the impact of that grief and loss is still very much present, especially at this time of year \u2014 however you feel is perfectly fine.\"\n\nHere's how to help: It's OK not to know what to say. Sometimes sitting in silence and listening is the perfect way to show support.\n\nListen without directing away from the grief.\n\nSend a quick text to let them know you're thinking of them or ask if they would like to meet for a coffee.\n\nShare memories and stories.\n\nDon't be afraid to mention their mother's name.\n\nDon't assume the person grieving is over their loss just because they appear to be having a good day.\n\nKeep in touch.\n\nShe said the time leading up to Mother's Day could be just as tough but there were ways to support those who were grieving.\n\nWhile Motherless Daughters Australia is an organisation created specifically for women, much of the support and insights shared can be equally helpful for sons who are grieving, or for those wanting to support a bereaved woman.",

(Supplied: Carol Weeks)\n\nDry flooding lessons\n\nThe couple set off on their trip on March 18 when much of coastal Queensland was recovering from heavy downpours and ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.\n\nFarmers brace for stock losses Photo shows An ariel from helicopter of building under water. Queensland graziers say more aviation fuel is desperately needed as helicopters play a key role in evacuations, supply drops, and mustering.\n\nAs they crossed into the desert three days later, Mr Esler said there was not a cloud in sight despite the state's northern region copping the brunt of wet weather.\n\n\"There hadn't been any rain there. We looked at the weather radar \u2014 which we now know does not cover the area,\" he said.\n\nThe nearest high-resolution Doppler radar is over 500 kilometres away from Bedourie in Mount Isa \u2014 a sore point for many who say they were caught off guard by outback flooding.\n\nMr Esler was one of them.\n\n\" We thought we should be right getting through. Little did we know it had already rained further north and the mass of water was just [travelling] down. \"\n\nThe pair enjoyed the rich landscapes of the state's outback. (Supplied: Carol Weeks)\n\nThe unique rivulets that make up the Channel Country delivered so-called dry flooding to communities hundreds of kilometres from where rains fell on other parts of western Queensland.\n\nThe pair, armed with a trusty 4x4 camper and four-wheel drive, made camp for the night in Bedourie, with plans to finish their detour to Birdsville the following morning.\n\n\"That's when we learned it didn't matter if it rained on us or not. We weren't getting through anywhere,\" Mr Esler said.\n\nLife on a loop\n\nLong-made plans changed overnight and, looking back, Ms Weeks said she was still shocked at the speed of the water.\n\nPicturesque sunsets helped to lighten the mood when life felt stuck on a loop. (Supplied: Carol Weeks)\n\n\"We woke up early and thought, 'We need to go,'\" she said.\n\n\"We headed out straight away without even any breakfast. Basically the floodwaters were already there.\"\n\nShallow but broad-stretching waters consumed the bitumen in all directions, turning the town into an island.\n\n\"It got to a point where we couldn't see where the road ended. We had to turn around \u2014 it just didn't feel safe,\" Ms Weeks said.\n\nIt quickly became evident it would be some time before the road trip would resume.\n\nThe couple have braved the elements, to some extent, while living in their camping trailer. (Supplied: Carol Weeks)\n\nThe set up \u2014 with no air conditioning to break up the days where the mercury hit 40 degrees Celsius \u2014 was far from glamorous.\n\n\"The camper is not large. There's enough room for one person to stand up comfortably but it's not meant to be lived in as a house,\" Mr Esler said.\n\nEmbracing the bush attitude, the pair made the best of the situation.\n\nMs Weeks says the 25-metre public pool became a sanctuary away from the flies each day. (Supplied: Carol Weeks)\n\n\"We got into a routine every day \u2014 wake up and have breakfast, fight the flies off, then we'd normally go down and check out the flood waters,\" Mr Esler said.\n\n\" There were hard days right towards the end. Most of it we just took the attitude that we couldn't go anywhere, we'll look at it like a beach holiday. \"\n\nDonning a fly net became part of the routine to endure the swarm. (Supplied: Carol Weeks)\n\nAdjusting to the bush lifestyle\n\nFor Ms Weeks, becoming \"temporary residents\" and blending in with the locals helped ease the wait.\n\n\"They spoke to us, they explained how the rivers and channels run into each other, we were invited to community events. We just got into our little groove,\" she said.\n\nThere were even differences from home the couple came to appreciate.\n\n\"I can't walk over to the shops \u2026 from my own home, I have to drive 10 minutes,\" Ms Weeks said.\n\n\"So it was nice walking over to the roadhouse to pick up a carton of milk or whatever, or go and harass someone for a chat.\"\n\nDaily walks to check water levels became more hopeful as flooding receded. (Supplied: Carol Weeks)\n\nMr Esler said after nearly five weeks, when the water receded low enough to make their way out, a sense of emotion washed over the pair.\n\n\"It wasn't a sense of elation, it was almost like a sense of leaving somewhere and leaving something behind,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the interesting things about Bedourie is that there are a lot of people who don't come from that area.\n\n\"We met people who were backpackers that are working there now and they'd love to stay there.\n\n\"That speaks volumes.\"",

    "text": "Victoria's taxi and rideshare companies will undergo a suite of changes in a bid to crack down on dodgy drivers and stamp out bad behaviour.\n\nOn Friday the state government announced a package of reforms which would include increasing the penalties for bad behaviour, mandating audio recordings and a new \"two-strike rule\".\n\n\"Our commercial passenger vehicle (CPV) industry is incredibly important for our city and state,\" transport minister Gabrielle Williams said.\n\n\"Which is why it's so important that we ensure that it is as safe as it can possibly be and as reliable as it can possibly be.\"\n\nThe new two-strike rule would be similar to what exists in New South Wales, allowing the regulator to cancel the accreditation of a driver who has two fare-related convictions.\n\nThe government says it is committed to stamping out bad behaviour by drivers. (ABC News)\n\nIn addition to that, drivers might also have their accreditation cancelled or suspended if there is a pattern of complaints made against them, including for things like not using a meter.\n\n\"There might be complaints made about an individual driver that are very similar but fall below that conviction threshold, it still allows the regulator to do something about it,\" Ms Williams said.\n\nThe news was welcomed by Victorian Taxi Association director Peter Valentine, who said it was something the organisation had wanted for a long time.\n\n\u201cWe don't want ... those type of drivers in the state. It's not good for the state and it's not good for the industry,\" he said.\n\nHe questioned whether it would be enforced properly, but said that was the responsibility of the government.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that they do enforce it and that [drivers are made] fully aware ... that it's not something that they can take on lightly,\" he said.\n\n\" It's two strikes and you're gone and that's it. \"\n\nMandatory recordings don't go far enough, peak body says\n\nThe announcement followed media reports in The Age which detailed how a taxi driver abused and scammed a number of passenger with disabilities.\n\nSome incidents were captured on CCTV and ultimately led to the driver's conviction.\n\n\"We saw some reporting earlier this year which quite frankly put on display some utterly unacceptable and disgusting behaviour by a small number, and we do know it's a minority cohort, of drivers in our CPV industry,\" Ms Williams said.\n\n\"That conduct that was reported is quite clearly unacceptable to all Victorians.\"\n\nUnder the changes, camera rules will be updated to give carers access to live, in-vehicle camera vision, if it is offered by the taxi or rideshare company.\n\nIt will also be mandatory for cameras in booked vehicles to record the audio and vision of those rides.\n\nThe government said it would assist in building evidence when a complaint was made and would also allow companies to act swiftly.\n\nBut Mr Valentine said whilst it was a good start, it needed to expand beyond booked taxis.\n\nPassengers can access QR codes in taxis to make a complaint more easily. (ABC News: Kathy Lord)\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen incidents in North Melbourne of rape out of rideshare cars,\" he said.\n\n\"It cannot stop at taxis. It has to be in all commercial passenger vehicles, and that means it must also be in your rideshare car.\"\n\nIt has become easier for passengers to make a complaint with the rollout of QR codes, which link passengers directly to a complaints page, earlier this year.\n\nThe page also provides passengers with information about unlawful conduct.\n\n\"Its about accountability, it's about safety and it's about making sure Victorians have confidence in what is an incredibly important service in our state,\" Ms Williams said.\n\nThe government said these changes were just the start of measures to be rolled out.\n\nMs Williams said the government was also keen to expand the retention time of footage in vehicles. Recordings are currently kept for 72 hours.\n\nShe said camera settings would be reviewed to better understand technological constraints before making any changes there.",

(ABC News: Mietta Adams)\n\nThe exorbitant prices cannot be attributed to one single issue, but a combination of factors that make it extremely expensive to build new homes.\n\n\"We know that the market is not in balance,\" Premier Roger Cook said, while spruiking a construction update in Karratha this week.\n\nState and local governments, as well as the region's big mining companies, have poured millions into fixing the problem.\n\nFor example, the federal government has splashed $22.1 million to release 199 lots at a site in Karratha.\n\nThe City of Karratha, Rio Tinto and Woodside have also provided 66 dwellings across the city to support service workers.\n\nNo tradies to build them\n\nPort Hedland real estate agent Morag Lower said no amount of money from governments or mining companies would get more homes built quickly.\n\nKarratha's population is predicted to rise by 35 per cent by 2030.

(ABC News: Charlie McLean)\n\n\"You're actually going to be able to buy an existing property cheaper than it would be to build,\" she said.\n\n\"There's very little choice in a town like Port Hedland for builders.\"\n\nKarratha Mayor Dan Scott said the situation was the same across the Pilbara, stalling vital housing projects for years.\n\n\"Over the last five years you can count on one hand how many development approvals we have given for a house,\" he said.\n\nHousing goes to industry\n\nResidential and social housing developments have struggled to get off the ground in Karratha, while developments backed by large resource companies are steaming ahead.\n\nInternational fertiliser company Perdaman has started building 31 of its 100 planned houses in Karratha, part of a combined $122 million state government project.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook says big resources companies should build homes for their workers.

Everyone in the league is comfortable,\" Saikia said.\n\n\"The safety and security of every player \u2014 be it a local player or a foreigner \u2014 every match official and every fan is important for us.\n\n\"We have the clearance of every single authority.\"\n\nPakistan Super League moves to UAE\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Super League will move the remaining matches of its season to the United Arab Emirates amid the ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India.\n\nA match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings, due to be held in Rawalpindi, was postponed after Pakistan's military said Indian drones were destroyed in various Pakistan cities.\n\nA Pakistan Cricket Board official told the BBC that one drone misfired and led to an explosion in the street behind the stadium in Rawalpindi.

(ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Jo Prendergast)\n\nRationing feed, waiting for rain\n\nNear Streaky Bay on the Eyre Peninsula, farmer Dion Trezona has been rationing the feed he has left for his sheep while hoping for rain.\n\nLast year, he cut 60 bales of hay.\n\nHe usually grows about 1,000.\n\n\"It's less than ideal,\" he said.\n\n\"When you only have 100mm of rain for the whole year last year, the feed now is pretty well non-existent.\n\n\"It's going to be very, very tight getting through to the finish line [after rain] at the end of June.\"\n\nMr Trezona said he had brought some manufactured sheep pellets from WA on trucks.\n\nRunning out of hay was his biggest concern.\n\nHe said some grain prices had soared and the freight cost for feed was adding $100-to-$150 a tonne to his expenses.\n\n\"There's no support over here in South Australia for the majority of grain producers in the state,\" he said.\n\n\"The state government here seems to think we'll grow the money to get the economy going for the state, but they don't have to support us in the middle.\n\n\"When you're 1,000 kilometres from anywhere and you just want stuff to rock up in bulk, a bit of support for some freight subsidies would be appreciated, if not needed.\"\n\nDion Trezona says he is worried about running out of hay.

There's a lot of risk involved.\n\n\" This is denying efficient trade of goods, which actually hurts everyone, it hurts the engine room of the economy. \"\n\nJohn Orr says the costs of interstate shipping are prohibitive. (Supplied: John Orr)\n\nReview underway\n\nAfter promising to create a \"strategic fleet\" of up to 12 Australian-flagged and crewed vessels for commercial operation in 2019, the Commonwealth government also commissioned a strategic fleet task force report.\n\nIt made recommendations to reverse the decline of the Australian shipping fleet.\n\nThe report suggested shipping taxation incentives and government financial assistance be provided to ship owners and operators to reduce the cost gap between Australian and foreign vessels.\n\nMaritime Industry Australia chief executive Angela Gillham said tax reform, such as seafarers' income tax and changing corporate tax settings, was essential to make Australian vessels cost competitive with their international counterparts.\n\n\"When we are talking about the competitive nature of Australian ships versus international, it's really all about tax,\" she said.\n\n\"There are some really good opportunities to reduce the cost differential between Australian and foreign ships that are available for the government to do right now.\"\n\nMs Gillham said the government needed to act swiftly.\n\n\"We have about nine vessels left, for a very large island nation that has a significant shipping task that exists within a fairly volatile geopolitical dynamic at the moment, vulnerable supply chains, we think it is incredibly urgent,\" she said.\n\n\"We needed to get started on this a decade ago.\"\n\nSupply chain task force\n\nAfter floods cut railway lines in 2022, the WA government formed a shipping and supply chain task force to examine industry links between WA, interstate and international customers.\n\n\"Current [Commonwealth] policy favours the use of international shipping lines for most import, export and domestic sea-borne freight,\" the taskforce report noted.\n\nThe report made a range of recommendations, including that the WA government work with the Commonwealth and other states to \"level the field\" with international carriers and stimulate an Australian-flagged fleet.\n\nSheep farmers in South Australia are carefully budgeting livestock feed. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Jo Prendergast)\n\nWA farmers miss price premiums\n\nBarry Large heads up Grain Producers Australia, a national organisation representing grain growers.\n\nHe said Australian growers should have access to any domestic market at any time as long as biosecurity protocols were met.\n\n\"When it comes to handling and shipping, I find it distasteful that we can't work this out to be able to help these places that are in need of quality product,\" he said.\n\n\"It's putting added costs onto the growers who are finding it tough at the moment because they can't access [the WA] market, so really it's not helping anyone here.\"\n\nMr Large said bulk shipping would normally be the most cost-effective way of moving large volumes of grain, while removing it from the road network.\n\n\"Quantity [should] mean decreased costs, and when it works the other way, you really have to ask questions.\"\n\nMr Large said the current legislation review was an opportunity to create a more flexible and cost-competitive domestic shipping system.\n\nA final report for the Coastal Trading Act review is due this year.",

    "text": "By late last week it was clear Labor would win the election, but it came as more of a surprise when Peter Dutton lost the Queensland seat of Dickson he'd held since 2001.\n\nNor did many anticipate Greens leader Adam Bandt, member for Melbourne since 2010, would be swept away, in a lower house rout that has seen the minor party stripped of three of its four House of Representative seats.\n\nBoth the Liberals and the Greens are in existential moments, in need of new leaders and some painful introspections about their future directions.\n\nThinking back to the Liberal experience after Kevin Rudd's 2007 victory, some wonder why anyone would be putting up their hand for the party leadership.\n\nThe Liberals churned through three leaders between 2007 and 2009. Brendan Nelson took over the party after Labor's victory; undermined by Malcolm Turnbull, he lasted less than a year. Turnbull survived just over a year before being ousted by Tony Abbott.\n\nAdmittedly the experience of Peter Dutton was different \u2014 he was given a full term as opposition leader.\n\nBut the chances of Dutton's successor becoming prime minister will be very low. With the added seats Labor has won, the Liberals are looking at a two-term strategy. The odds are on more than one leader, and generational change, in that time. Tim Wilson, 45, who has won back Goldstein, obviously has his eye on the prize in the longer term.\n\nLoading\n\nDespite all the disincentives, Sussan Ley, 63, and Angus Taylor, 58, both want this thankless post that's up for grabs at Tuesday's party meeting.\n\nThe battle has turned into a fight over negatives as much as positives. Supporters of Ley say Taylor did a dreadful job as shadow treasurer, including not producing a tax policy. The Taylor camp argues Ley, the deputy leader, under-performed generally.\n\nBoth contenders hold regional NSW electorates. Taylor's support base is the conservative wing of the party; Leys' is the moderate wing. The relative weightings of the factions in the Liberal party room has changed somewhat as a result of the election, in the favour of the moderates.\n\nFor those Liberal MPs whose votes are not tightly locked in by factional allegiances, there are multiple questions they need to consider.\n\nWho will be able to keep the party together, while forcing it to face up to what changes it must make, and driving a major overhaul of policy? Who can improve the Liberals' standing with women, and with younger voters? Who can better handle the relationship with the Nationals?\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads in your inbox Photo shows Virginia Trioli in a stylish suit on a set with lighting behind her Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.\n\nOn the last point, anyone who might think it would be best to break the Coalition is, I believe, misguided. Going it alone didn't work in the 1970s and the 1980s. Different as they may be, the Liberals and Nationals are, electorally, two parts of a whole.\n\nThey need their collective numbers to win and they're better to stay together in opposition, to make the partnership in government work. But the relationship may be rocky.\n\nAt the election, the Nationals retained almost all their seats and will have a relatively bigger voice from now on.\n\nOn Thursday, however, their highest-profile senator, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, jumped from the Nationals to the Liberals. She said she thought she could be more effective in the Liberals, \"especially as the party faces a significant rebuild [\u2026] I feel obliged to play a robust part in\".\n\nThis was a concerted move from the right, and will play into the leadership contest in an as-yet unclear way. With speculation that she might run as Taylor's deputy, Price was asked on Sky on Thursday night if she would be willing to be drafted for a position. \"I will not put any limitations on myself,\" she said.\n\nFor the Liberals, there is absolutely no silver lining from this election. The Greens can take some comfort in the fact they\u2019ve retained their numbers (11) in the Senate, with only a small fall in their Senate vote. On the projected results, the Greens are set to be the sole negotiators with the government in the Senate on legislation opposed by the Coalition.\n\nWho will become leader is still an open question, with South Australian veteran senator Sarah Hanson-Young, deputy leader Mehreen Faruqi, and the party\u2019s Senate leader, Larissa Waters, mentioned. Whoever gets the post, the leadership will return to the Senate, where it always was until Bandt obtained the position in early 2020.\n\nPost election, Anthony Albanese has continued his fierce pre-election attack on the Greens. \u201cWhat I hope comes out of the new Senate is a bit of a recognition that one of the reasons why the Greens political party have had a bad outcome in the election is the view that they simply combined with the Coalition in what I termed the \u2018noalition\u2019, to provide blockages, and that occurred across a range of portfolios, housing, treasury, as well as environment,\u201d he told the ABC.\n\nAlbanese was particularly scathing about Greens housing spokesman Max Chandler-Mather who lost his seat and criticised parliament as a \u201csick place\u201d.\n\n\u201cMaybe what he needs is a mirror and a reflection on why he\u2019s no longer in parliament. [\u2026] This is a guy who stood before signs at a CFMEU rally in Brisbane describing me as a Nazi.\u201d\n\nBob Brown, the Greens\u2019 inaugural leader from 2005 to 2012, describes Albanese\u2019s comments as \"ungracious\" in \"his moment of glory\".\n\nABC Politics in your inbox Photo shows Brett Worthington looks at the camera wearing a blue blazer and glasses Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington\n\nWhile the Greens' pro-Palestinian position came under much criticism, Brown strongly defends it, declaring it \"honorable\".\n\nBrown, speaking to The Conversation, says the Greens will be in an extraordinarily powerful position in the Senate, and their \"environmental origins will come back to the fore\". He urges the Greens to \"have deaf ears to calls for the Senate to be a rubber stamp\". The constitution, he says, has the Senate with equal powers with the house except on money matters.\n\nBrown predicts the Greens will be \"resurgent\" at the next election. His strongest message is directed squarely at the government. \"The Greens should never direct preferences to Labor again \u2014 because Labor takes preferences with one hand and stabs the Greens with the other.\"\n\nLike the new Liberal leader, Bandt's successor will inherit a party at a fork in the road. Does it become more militant or more moderate, more confrontational in its dealing with the government, or as transactional as possible?\n\nBandt's hope of the Greens power-sharing with a Labor government in the lower house has evaporated. So how does the party use what power it has in the Senate, while trying to put itself in the best position to avoid going further backwards at the next election?\n\nMichelle Grattan is a professorial fellow at the University of Canberra and chief political correspondent at The Conversation, where this article first appeared.",

We're aware of the record they have here, the pitch. I think the lads handled it well. Excited, we're in a final.\n\n\"We've grown in maturity and we understand exactly what's required. I think that's where we won the game. We kept them to a minimum in the first half and did what we needed to do.\n\n\"We've used every player in the squad. We've overcome adversity. I felt when we got into the knockout, it helped we got players back.\"\n\nPostecoglou also paid tribute to the Spurs fans who have stuck by him in a difficult season.\n\n\"It's why you do what we do,\" he said.\n\n\"You understand the context of what this football club has been trying to achieve for quite a while. Managers and players come and go but the supporters are a constant. There were 400 here tonight and maybe a few more snuck in and many more at home. I hope we gave them something to smile about.\n\n\"We'll just keep doing what we're doing.\"\n\nTottenham will play Manchester United in the Europa League final on Thursday, May 22 at 5am (AEST).

    "text": "He plans to revisit the rule when his daughters are around 15, \u201cwhen they\u2019re more mature and when they\u2019re more armed to defend themselves, I suppose, in the event of something happening\u201d. Changing cultural attitudes to sleepovers Gabrielle Hunt, a PhD candidate at Australian Catholic University and a registered psychologist, says more Australian parents are becoming wary of sleepovers. Some are worried about the risk of sexual abuse, says Hunt. Others, she says, are concerned about technology use, and differing family\u2019s rules around devices.\n\nEqually, Hunt acknowledges that sleepovers can be an important stage of development for many children. Loading \u201cSleepovers can be an opportunity to build really close relationships with their peers and develop resilience about being away from home, and having to look after some of those self-care tasks that might otherwise be prompted by mum or dad,\u201d says Hunt. Is there a \u2018right\u2019 age for sleepovers? There is no right age for children to start attending sleepovers, says parenting educator and founder of Connected Parenting Genevieve Muir.\n\nA mother of four boys under 18, Muir does allow sleepovers, but says the right age has varied from child to child. \u201cOne of my kids has a significant speech challenge. I wasn\u2019t going to let him have a sleepover as fast as his older brother because I knew that should something happen, he wouldn\u2019t have the ability to communicate that as well to me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s looking at the skills and where my child is at and thinking, \u2018Well, is my child ready?\u2019 Not just in a \u2018want to go\u2019 capacity, but in an emotional readiness and a self-readiness,\u201d she says. \u201cIt should be a decision that happens between parents and their children in terms of what they both feel comfortable with,\u201d says Hunt.\n\nTheir first sleepover Loading Ahead of a child\u2019s first sleepover, Hunt says it\u2019s important to nail the basics \u2013 like toileting, showering and table customs. Then, make sure your child has an exit strategy should they need one. \u201cIt\u2019s about communicating, \u2018It\u2019s okay if you want to go home\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really common for kids to get to bedtime and miss home or it\u2019s really scary because it\u2019s the first time. So just reassure children that it\u2019s okay if you need to get picked up, even if it\u2019s late,\u201d says Hunt. Loading She recommends ensuring your child knows who to speak with should they need an \u201cout\u201d, or scheduling a time for you to call. She says preparing your child for their first sleepover should start well before the age they are ready. \u201cThe single biggest thing we can do as parents is have open, ongoing, honest conversations about children that empower them,\u201d she says.\n\nHow to talk to the host family Ahead of a sleepover, particularly if it\u2019s your child\u2019s first time with a host family, Hunt recommends talking with the host adults. This includes broaching topics like \u201cwhen is an appropriate bedtime, what your rules and expectations around device use are, and who else is going to be in the home when this sleepover happens,\u201d including if parents might be leaving kids with a babysitter. Consider an \u201ceverything but the sleep\u201d sleepover, where the kids stay up late, have a midnight snack, then return home to sleep. There\u2019s no need to feel uncomfortable asking questions, either, if they can help you and your child feel at ease.\n\nIf the sleepover is with a family you don\u2019t know well, Hunt suggests holding a daytime get-together beforehand. If you are simply not comfortable with a family, always trust your gut, says Muir. Sleepover alternatives If you don\u2019t think your child is ready for sleepovers, there\u2019s no need for them to miss out on the fun. Hunt recommends the \u201ceverything-but-the-sleep sleepover\u201d as an alternative, where kids might have a late night but return home to sleep in their own bed.\n\nMuir suggests talking with your child about why they want to attend a sleepover. Loading \u201cWe can\u2019t really expect a child to understand, \u2018I\u2019m trying to keep you safe\u2019. They don\u2019t care about that. They just want to go on the sleepover.\u201d Instead, try to understand their motives. \u201cIt might be, \u2018We\u2019re going to have a midnight snack and we\u2019ve been talking about it\u2019. So you could say, \u2018Let\u2019s have your friend over, we\u2019ll have a late snack and then I\u2019ll drop them home.\u2019 You can come up with alternatives when you understand what the motive is.\u201d",

    "text": "Two years later, in November 2021, it appeared her seven-year campaign to hold the near-trillion-dollar company to account in a public court had finally stalled, however. Having insisted on representing herself, taking on Tesla\u2019s army of expensive lawyers alone to keep costs down, her defamation case was thrown out. Musk, it seemed, was victorious. But, four years on, his words could come back to haunt him. Despite battling late-stage breast cancer, Balan refused to give up. Last month, the indefatigable mother-of-one won an appeal that reverses the decision \u2013 and opens the way for her explosive claims to be heard in public. \u2018It was not easy to think that my son\u2019s memory of me would be overshadowed because of this scumbag.\u2019 \u201cI cannot wait to see Musk and his goons on the stand and see how they will explain their lies and hate against me for doing the right thing,\u201d posted Balan on X shortly after the decision was handed down on April 14. A fortnight later, speaking from Jacksonville, Florida, she is no less combative.\n\n\u201cWhat a pathetic hypocrite that monster is,\u201d she tells The Telegraph, in a thick Transylvanian accent. \u201cAt the same time, he\u2019s bragging about being the free speech absolutist, he\u2019s paying millions of dollars in legal fees to make sure I never have my day in court.\u201d \u201cI have the evidence for everything,\u201d she adds, claiming that several top executives have agreed to testify in her case, and that Tesla is very much aware of one particularly damning recording. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason Musk is so p-----.\u201d Serious quality and safety concerns Growing up just 15 minutes from Bran Castle, otherwise known as Dracula\u2019s Castle, Balan\u2019s favourite toys as a child were pliers and screwdrivers. While other girls played with dolls, she would often be found with oil on her clothes and in her hair, taking engines and motors apart and putting them together again. Tesla\u2019s stock price is the key to Musk\u2019s business empire and his personal life. Credit: Getty Images\n\nAfter marrying aged 22, she went on to earn a degree in engineering and then moved to Canada in the early noughties. She later joined Boeing to work on the interior of the 787 Dreamliner in Seattle. In 2010, she was hired by Tesla \u2013 still a relatively small company \u2013 to help design the battery pack for the Model S. Well-liked and known for being a hard worker, she solved a crucial problem early on that had baffled managers and was delaying the sedan going into production. In recognition, her initials were etched into the battery pack case, which can still be found on some models. In a court document, Tesla\u2019s lawyers admitted Balan was \u201cat the heart of innovation at Tesla\u201d. Branding Musk an arrogant \u201cspoiled brat\u201d who would constantly flaunt his wealth, her memory is no doubt tainted by subsequent dealings with his lawyers. But aside from some suggestive remarks about the \u201cwell-equipped\u201d girls in the office when she was in earshot, she doesn\u2019t recall any particularly bad run-ins with him. Loading Indeed, it was Musk she turned to directly in 2014 when she first discovered \u201cserious safety and quality\u201d flaws after joining the interior fittings team. In an email, she sidestepped her own line manager and requested a meeting with him to discuss her concerns that the interior floor mats could curl up and interfere with the brake pedal.\n\nHowever, on the day of the meeting with Musk, HR instead allegedly marched her to a \u201cdungeon room\u201d, where two security guards \u201cwith guns and handcuffs around their waist\u201d were told to stay outside \u201cin case she runs away\u201d. She claims she was pressured to resign immediately. Feeling like she had no alternative, Balan signed the paper in front of her, but wrote she was only doing so because she had \u201cdare[d] to speak up\u201d to senior management. Shocked, Balan says she fainted as she was escorted out. Ever since, she has been fighting to clear her name. \u201cThat made my fight with cancer even more difficult,\u201d Balan says. \u201cBecause there were quite a few moments they didn\u2019t know if I would make it. It was not easy to think that my son\u2019s memory of me would forever be overshadowed because of this scumbag.\u201d She reserves particular anger for arbitration agreements. For the first few years, she was unable to fight the claims publicly due to the clause inserted into every Tesla contract. The concept was first introduced in the US in 1925 to relieve the burden on the court system by moving business contract disputes into a separate forum. But their use has mushroomed. Research suggests 80 per cent of the largest US companies have used such agreements in workplace disputes. (They are far less common in the UK, where employees have greater protections.) Such clauses \u2013 which notoriously tend to favour the employer \u2013 are \u201ca back door for nasty corporations to steal freedom of speech\u201d, says Balan.\n\nAfter three years in private arbitration over her removal from the company, Balan was awarded $US350,000) \u2013 \u201cpeanuts\u201d compared to the $US40 million she says the shares she relinquished when she left would now be worth. She was not willing to give up and decided to go public with her claims in 2017. Tesla was incensed. In response to a Huffington Post article which marked the first coverage of her case by the media, bosses demanded a 600-word rebuttal that made claims of \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d by Balan when she was an employee \u2013 despite never having raised these in the arbitration hearings. In 2019, Balan filed her defamation lawsuit, claiming it damaged her reputation and made it near impossible for her to find a job. She alleges it left her effectively blacklisted. On one occasion, a British director at a US company rang her to explain that he\u2019d wanted to hire her but his legal team had intervened, Balan claims. \u201cThey kept calling and threatening people who wanted to hire me that they couldn\u2019t afford to be on the wrong side of Elon Musk,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was worse than having a crazy maniac as an ex-boyfriend.\u201d \u2018Toe to toe with a billionaire bully\u2019 Balan is not the only Tesla whistleblower to find herself at the mercy of Musk\u2019s hardball tactics. In 2018, former Tesla technician Martin Tripp told Business Insider that Tesla was wasting a \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d amount of raw material as it ramped up production of the Model 3. The response? Musk accused Tripp of being a \u201csaboteur\u201d, suing him for $US167 million for allegedly hacking the company\u2019s systems, stealing trade secrets, and leaking information to the media.\n\nTesla even informed police it had received a tip that the former employee might \u201ccome back and shoot people\u201d at the Gigafactory in Nevada where he worked. The sheriff\u2019s investigation concluded \u201cthere was no credible threat\u201d. Tripp insisted he had leaked the information out of legitimate concern and, believing he had been defamed as a would-be mass shooter, countersued. But the case swung Tesla\u2019s way \u2013 with Tripp ordered to pay Tesla $US400,000 in damages in 2020. Balan had raised safety concerns about the firm\u2019s Model S vehicles directly with Musk back in 2014. Credit: AP In Balan\u2019s case, after sending Musk an intent to sue, the defamation claim failed to settle. \u201cOne of my conditions was for them to apologise and admit\u2026 that everything they said was a lie \u2013 and they didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Instead, she says, Musk opted for his favoured weapon \u2013 \u201clawfare\u201d \u2013 and the battle continued. As the richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $US330 billion, Musk is not shy of a legal fight. In 2018, British cave diver Vernon Unsworth, who helped rescue a trapped youth football team from a flooded Thai cave, sued Musk for \u00a3142 million ($293 million). Musk had branded Unsworth a \u201cpedo\u201d on X after the diver criticised his proposal to use a mini-submarine in the rescue as a PR stunt. He willingly went to court to contest the case \u2013 and won. Unsworth\u2019s lawyer subsequently lamented that his client had gone \u201ctoe to toe with a billionaire bully\u201d.\n\nIt makes Balan\u2019s case all the more remarkable. Crucially, early on in the defamation case, a judge ruled all the confidentiality clauses in her Tesla contract could be dropped. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why I can legally talk to you now,\u201d she explains. But by the beginning of 2022, her case had seemed all but over as her claim was thrown out by a judge in California and her arbitration verdict was confirmed, closing the matter. Again, Balan refused to give up and appealed the decision. A week later, she was diagnosed with stage-3B breast cancer. As she underwent treatment, she twice asked for a continuation, where the case is put on hold for a certain period. The second time, Tesla\u2019s lawyers refused, she alleges. \u201cSo when the due date came to file it last January, I was so exhausted, and the treatment was so harsh and powerful, I was barely\u2026\u201d she says, pausing. \u201cMy body was struggling to go to the bathroom. This is how bad I was.\u201d Last month\u2019s decision by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal effectively nullified her arbitration award as a court judgment, reopening the possibility for Balan to pursue her defamation claims in a proper court of law. Though not yet a victory, it is a significant milestone \u2013 and one that is giving other Tesla whistleblowers hope, she says, adding that several have contacted her since the ruling. Loading \u201cEverybody said that it\u2019s impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly a handful of people for so many years actually trusted me that I could do it. But I did it.\u201d How does she feel now? \u201cI\u2019m feeling really happy \u2013 I proved them wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cI proved to them an immigrant woman engineer had the capacity, the brain power, to learn their stupid legal system and actually win. So yeah, I feel pretty damn good.\u201d",

I\u2019ve missed every Anzac Day until this year.\u201d Reid, whose draft season was wiped out by the COVID-19 pandemic, was bedridden for weeks, but eventually made it back on the training track. Only weeks in, scans revealed a stress fracture in his lower back.\n\n\u201cI think being in bed for ages, and then coming back to an AFL program, on top of missing so much footy during COVID, didn\u2019t help a growing body,\u201d he said. That ended Reid\u2019s season after just one senior match. Bone stress in the sesamoid bone in his right foot in the ensuing pre-season was just a minor nuisance in comparison. Reid was otherwise injury free in 2022, adding seven senior games and 12 in the VFL. But by December that year, his back stress fractures returned. \u201cThat was really flattening,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were trying to help, and saying, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve got 10 years ahead of you; don\u2019t worry about it\u2019 \u2013 but I think the average [AFL] career length is four years. I was like, \u2018You don\u2019t have a crystal ball, so you can\u2019t really say that\u2019.\n\n\u201cMy mindset back then was, \u2018Poor me; why is this happening to me?\u2019. You think when you\u2019re a top-10 pick, you\u2019re going to come in, and it\u2019s going to go smoothly, but then you get hit in the face with some adversity.\u201d Learning to better handle his setbacks, which Reid said came with maturity and perspective \u2013 \u201cIt could be a lot worse. I could be homeless\u201d \u2013 proved crucial. His three hamstring injuries, all on his left leg, and a ruptured left pectoral muscle were still to come. Zach Reid\u2019s wretched injury history 2021: Reid diagnosed with glandular fever after making his AFL debut in round five against Brisbane Lions. Three months later, after being bedridden then rebuilding his fitness, scans reveal he has a stress fracture in his lower back. 2022: Bone stress is detected in the sesamoid bone of his right foot in pre-season. He wears orthotics to remedy the issue, and plays most of the season between the AFL and VFL. 2023: Another back stress fracture interrupts his pre-season and delays his season start. Shortly after returning in the VFL, Reid suffers a T-junction hamstring injury in his left leg that sidelines him for six weeks. In testing ahead of his planned VFL return, the injury flares up, prompting season-ending surgery. 2024: Suffers a left hamstring strain - in a different area to the previous two - in Essendon\u2019s round one win over Hawthorn. It costs him seven games, then in the fourth match of his comeback in the VFL, an opponent crashes into him, rupturing his left pectoral muscle, leading to another operation. The latter was a freak injury in a VFL match, where Reid went to tackle a Box Hill opponent who \u201csteamrolled\u201d through his arm and ruptured the injury-cursed Bomber\u2019s pec. Season-ending surgery followed. Playing on Anzac Day was not Reid\u2019s only highlight this season. He also had the chance to share the field with, and play directly on, his brother, West Coast forward-ruck Archer.\n\n\u201cI was the perfect match-up for him,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe both didn\u2019t really have any impact, so it was funny, but it was good that it was close. It made it entertaining for our parents.\u201d The Reid brothers, Zach and Archer, played against each other in round six. Credit: AFL Photos Reid insists the only change now he is playing regularly is the extra attention from media and fans, some of whom thank him for being a \u201cbargain buy\u201d in fantasy football. \u201cI\u2019m outperforming my price, so that\u2019s the main thing fans are grateful for,\u201d he said, smiling.",

The earlier prospect of an underwhelming Lions squad was based on the premise that Ireland had plateaued, and while that is arguably still true it did not factor in an England rise.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size When does a dynasty die? There is no knowing when the end begins. Ivan Cleary, coach of the Panthers \u2013 who have won the past four NRL premierships but are now on a lowly ladder position, says, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure of the exact definition of a dynasty. Have we had one, or are we still in one at Penrith? There is no such thing as a machine in perpetual motion. At some point, you\u2019ve got to stop for fuel.\u201d He agrees the continual loss of players in the salary cap era, including three top-class ones at the end of the 2024 season \u2013 James Fisher-Harris, their physically dominant forward leader; Jarome Luai, the attacking foil for his own son, Nathan, and Sunia Turuva, a first-half tryscorer in last year\u2019s grand final - helps drain the tank. As will the coming loss of co-captain Isaah Yeo, Liam Martin, Cleary and possibly fullback Dylan Edwards to the NSW team, making it difficult to win enough games to make this year\u2019s top eight. Nor did results up to Magic Round suggest their replacements, despite being the product of the NRL\u2019s best assembly line, would help the Panthers peat, let alone five-peat. \u201cAll that adds to it possibly ending,\u201d says Cleary, on the eve of his team\u2019s comprehensive 32-8 win over the Broncos in Brisbane. The victory is a timely warning that it is foolish to proclaim the death of a dynasty. Ivan and Nathan Cleary after winning their fourth premiership. Credit: Getty Images There is no voice of doom from the top of the Blue Mountains saying the club is slipping down to the lowlands where the also-rans live. Melbourne is described as a dynasty, yet the club has never won consecutive premierships. If Cleary has doubts about the end of a dynasty, he has certainty about its beginning . When the Panthers were beaten 26-20 by Melbourne in the 2020 grand final, he told reporters, \u201cI\u2019d love to have the game tomorrow, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about it now, he says, \u201cI genuinely meant it. I felt like we ran out of time. I felt like I\u2019d like to have the first half again and it would have been enough. Although the play-offs had been tight, everything in the grand final went faster. The Storm\u2019s line speed was fantastic. We made a few mistakes. Nathan threw an intercept and couldn\u2019t get it out of his head. But I also thought at the time that this is part of the journey. And it was.\u201d If there are any doubts this was the game that motivated Penrith, the Panthers players made it obvious in their redemptive victory over Melbourne last year. It has never been previously reported but some of the Storm\u2019s younger players were shocked at the vitriol Penrith spewed at them as they stood behind the posts after a try. Luai had not forgotten the \u201cget back to Mount Druitt\u201d slur from the Storm\u2019s Jahrome Hughes. The Fibro versus Silvertail ethos of under-privilege persists in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs and Cleary, who has lived in Penrith for 14 years and still owns a house in the northern beaches, makes no apology for any sledging. \u201cIt was still remembered,\u201d he said. \u201cWe learnt a lot from the 2020 grand final, including a lot of stuff that happened off the ball.\u201d Cleary had coached more than 370 games by the time he won his first premiership. He had previously coached the Warriors, Panthers and Wests Tigers before returning to Penrith. Ivan Cleary in his first year of coaching the Warriors in 2006. Credit: David White It sounds ludicrous to suggest a man with all that experience, including taking the Warriors to the 2011 grand final, would grow as a coach along with his young team but he agrees. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d he says. \u201cMy career had all been about rebuild. By the time I got back to Penrith, it was the first time I actually thought I had a team that could win a grand final. I could see green shoots and blue sky.\u201d He admits he feared for his reputation. \u201cI wondered whether I would be the guy who was only known for dragging teams up out of the gutter and not reaching the top. I have definitely grown as coach along the way with these players.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenrith have led a tactical revolution in the NRL, using their back five to create field position and hence balance the energy output of backs and forwards. \u201cPart of that decision was personnel,\u201d says Cleary with reference to the power of the now injured winger Brian To\u2019o and fullback Edwards returning the ball to near halfway. \u201cThe beauty of the back five is that they can get the forwards thinking about defence. All our stats in the game are about attack but I\u2019ve always believed defence wins games and attack decides by how much.\u201d Some observers believe the Panthers led in exploiting the six-again rule by deliberately conceding breaches early in the tackle count to trap a team in its own 40-metre zone. \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t do it deliberately,\u201d Cleary says. \u201cWe place a lot of emphasis on controlling the ruck and line speed but the breaches weren\u2019t deliberate.\u201d He does admit to introducing the ruse of blockers preventing opposition players from hurrying the kicker. The Storm\u2019s Christian Welch was particularly effective harassing Nathan in the 2020 grand final and Penrith\u2019s sophisticated blocking system was the response. \u2018I wondered whether I would be the guy who was only known for dragging teams up out of the gutter and not reaching the top\u2019 Ivan Cleary \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment,\u201d Cleary says, before conceding the NRL subsequently did the job for him by penalising any player who makes contact with a kicker. \u201cHalves now have a level of protection on kicks.\u201d He also pleads guilty to the recent scrum ploy of the half placing the ball on the ground and retreating to first receiver in the backline, while a scrum player picks it up and feeds the ball. Insofar as it adds a man to the backline, it creates an overlap. \u201cThe Roosters did it to us and scored a try,\u201d Cleary admits. He wasn\u2019t resentful he had been punished by his own invention. \u201cI thought at the time, \u2018That is pretty cool, too.\u2019\u201d He explains the ploy came in response to the NRL ban on teams holding the ball at the base of the scrum. \u201cA lot of scrum tries came from that but the NRL stopped it and now they have done it again by making us re-start the scrum feed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he concedes the NRL\u2019s relentless mission to increase ball in play time by reducing stoppages has benefitted Penrith and Melbourne. \u201cThe continuity has helped us,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThe six-again rule has been good for us but most of the calls you don\u2019t know what they are for.\u201d He echoes the complaint of all coaches that referees can use repeat sets to even up a game. He welcomes a review of the salary cap, saying, \u201cPenrith doesn\u2019t get any rewards for players developed in our pathways going to other clubs as NRL players. We are doing a good job for the NRL producing players.\u201d Luai left after four premierships, including leading the team last year in place of an injured Nathan who also missed NSW\u2019s Origin winning series in which Luai played a stellar role. Asked if the Panthers under-valued the five-eighth, Cleary said, \u201cI definitely did not under-estimate him. We fought tooth and nail to keep him. We couldn\u2019t get near the money he was offered plus he wanted to forge his own path. I\u2019m proud of what he is doing at Wests Tigers but I wish he was here.\u201d Like his colleagues, he rails against the NRL draw which resembles something dreamed up by muppets Ernie and Bert. Penrith\u2019s Origin players are required to play a 3pm match on a Saturday in Auckland after the Wednesday evening Origin encounter in Perth. \u201cThey [Penrith\u2019s Origin representatives] won\u2019t be playing in Auckland,\u201d Cleary said.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Nathan and Ivan Cleary after Penrith lost the 2020 grand final. Credit: Getty So, let\u2019s go back to that 2020 grand final - the beginning of the Penrith dynasty. Would Cleary have liked a time-out, as they have in US sports, where a coach can stop the game and settle the players. \u201cIf we were able to have them, that\u2019s the sort of game where it would have helped,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the NRL we have time-outs for things we don\u2019t want time-outs for.\u201d As he sits in the coach\u2019s box at games, awaiting the Bunker\u2019s decision, he looks composed while his rivals stress and fume. \u201cUnderneath the surface, I ride all the highs and lows, just like the other coaches,\u201d he reveals.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Having won their semi-final tie 5-1 on aggregate over Bodo/Glimt, Spurs are into the Europa League final against Manchester United. So Postecoglou is 90 minutes away - maybe 120 - from having dropped one of the coldest quotes in modern football history. The psychological burden of Tottenham\u2019s 15-year trophy drought, which has weighed so heavily on this club, could be finally discarded. Ange Postecoglou in Bodo. Credit: nna\\seathompson By a man who, if certain reports are to be believed, will be discarded by the club regardless. Indeed, the question of his future remains - but it shouldn\u2019t. It is a ludicrous notion that a decision about whether Postecoglou is the right man to lead Spurs into the future, or at least the third year of his four-year contract, should hinge on a single fixture. It\u2019s even sillier if it\u2019s already been made.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly no glossing over how poor their Premier League season has been, and how inexplicably bad some of their performances have been in it. But there\u2019s enough evidence, if you want to see it, in how they\u2019ve performed in the Europa League, and how Postecoglou has set them up tactically, and how the players are responding to him, to suggest that there\u2019s still something in this project that is worth pursuing. The unity in the Tottenham camp - as captured by the club\u2019s channels, who posted his stirring post-match address to the players on social media - speaks for itself. Any other manager in these circumstances, and with those results, would have lost not only the dressing room but their own head long ago. Yves Bissouma leads the post-match celebrations. Credit: Getty Images Not Postecoglou. There\u2019s been some evidence of fraying, but fundamentally, he\u2019s kept it together. The biggest challenge for him at Spurs was never about wins and losses. It was about changing the mentality of this football club, about getting rid of the \u2018Spursy\u2019 tag. And he\u2019s doing it, bit by bit, challenging not only the external conversation about Tottenham but also their own internal self-defeating perceptions.\n\nLike the trips to Eintracht Frankfurt and AZ Alkmaar earlier in the tournament, many fans were petrified about the prospect of playing north of the Arctic Circle on a plastic pitch against a team in Bodo/Glimt with a giant-slaying record. In the end, there was nothing to be worried about. The players couldn\u2019t have been more focused. Postecoglou, too, has probably learned some things along the way. There\u2019s no doubt that Spurs are playing more pragmatic football in the Europa League than those who follow his teams would expect to see. His sides hardly ever launch it long from goal kicks; Tottenham did almost exclusively that in Bodo. Circumstances dictated it, as he explained afterwards, but there have been plenty of other times in his career where circumstances also dictated it, and he didn\u2019t go down this path. Why now, and not then? One for him to answer. Either way, those who knocked him earlier in the season for having no \u201cPlan B\u201d and never changing his tactics are quiet now. Pre-match, Postecoglou essentially laughed off the suggestion from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger - the ex-Arsenal manager, so not a disinterested party - that the Europa League winners didn\u2019t deserve to qualify for the UEFA Champions League the following season because the then-likely finalists Spurs and Man United were doing so poorly in the Premier League. They sit 16th and 15th respectively on the table.\n\nLoading Post-match, Postecoglou again took aim at the notion that people were \u201cfearing\u201d the prospect of Spurs actually winning something for once, and thus were working ahead of time to diminish their achievement before it happens. \u201cI could have been sitting here at exactly the same time in fifth position, and I can guarantee that the commentary around me would be: \u2018Well, that\u2019s great Ange, but this club needs to win something.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly what everyone would be saying,\u201d he said, calling the hypocrites out directly. \u201cSo of course it\u2019s massive. You have to frame it against what this club has been through over the last 15 or 20 years and what the supporters have been through.\u201d What they\u2019ve all been through this year, painful as it\u2019s been, might yet prove to be worth it.",

    "text": "The central bank will release its report on surcharging shortly, and the government will then decide whether to ban debit surcharges, while seeking to not disproportionately hurt small businesses. \u201cWe\u2019re cracking down on unfair and excessive card surcharges to get a better deal for Australians and small businesses,\u201d a spokesman for Treasurer Jim Chalmers said. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to ban debit card surcharges subject to the further work under way now by the Reserve Bank if there are sufficient safeguards to ensure both small businesses and consumers can benefit from lower costs.\u201d The Reserve says small businesses can be charged a whopping three times more in transaction fees than larger merchants.\n\nThe hospitality industry warns that menu prices will have to rise if businesses can no longer recover the cost of debit card payments from customers, saying a coffee that now costs $5.08 with a card surcharge might rise to $5.50. \u201cOf course it will be inflationary,\u201d said Wes Lambert, chief executive of the Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association. \u201cRemoving a debit surcharge will translate directly to the bottom line. And to mitigate this drop in profit, we\u2019ll see a sharp increase in prices much greater than 8\u00a2 that we currently pay on a cup of coffee. We\u2019ll be rounding that [price rise] to 10\u00a2, 20\u00a2 or even 50\u00a2.\u201d The Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association, the Australian Hotels Association and the Australian Lottery & Newsagents Association are lobbying the Reserve Bank against a ban. Card surcharging is more common in cafes, restaurants and pubs than in other sectors, the Reserve said. But Ebstein said the removal of surcharges would have a negligible effect on consumer prices and that any ensuing price rises by businesses would be opportunistic. He said the cost to merchants of accepting cards had reduced significantly since the Reserve first allowed surcharging in 2013.\n\nEbstein, of MWE Consulting, said businesses should regard card payment costs as another cost of being in business. \u201cYou don\u2019t charge someone an extra bit because you\u2019ve just done an advertising campaign, or you\u2019ve just paid your electricity bill,\u201d he said. \u201cCard costs actually reduce your overall costs because 30 years ago you were maintaining accounts for customers, there was a cost; most of your payments were in cash, there was a cost.\u201d Palace Cinema chief executive Benjamin Zeccola. Credit: Jason South Palace Cinemas chief executive Benjamin Zeccola said banning card surcharges would do \u201cserious damage to the sectors driving economic activity and employment\u201d. Surcharging helped businesses recover their costs transparently, Zeccola said.\n\n\u201cIf government reform eliminates that transparent mechanism without care, it\u2019s not cutting \u2018junk fees\u2019 \u2013 it is foisting them invisibly onto small businesses, pushing prices up, or worse, tipping fragile businesses over the edge,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s inflationary, not protective.\u201d Family-run book retailer the Book Depot goes against the norm by not charging the surcharge at the point of sale. \u201cAll of us find it annoying as consumers and so have avoided inflicting it on our customers,\u201d co-owner Tony Sidebottom said. \u201cWe also try and offer the cheapest books in the marketplace and this message doesn\u2019t sit comfortably alongside the surcharge.\u201d Sidebottom said the Book Depot regarded the surcharge as just another cost, like electricity. Tony Sidebottom of the Book Depot, which does not apply a surcharge at the point of sale. Credit: Paul Jeffers\n\n\u201cThe consumer pays for it anyway, really. With our business, our margins reduce very slightly but when we\u2019re considering pricing decisions, it\u2019s something we take into account.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said misleading surcharging practices were a compliance and enforcement priority. It regularly received tip-offs about alleged excessive surcharging, particularly by small and micro-businesses, it said. But big companies are not immune to excessive card surcharging. The competition watchdog said Europcar, Fitness First and Nine Entertainment, owner of The Age, had been financially penalised for charging surcharges that were greater than their costs. The Australian Banking Association said consumers \u201cshould always know the cost of an item before they pay for it\u201d. The association said while it wanted to see less surcharging, prohibiting it \u201cwould represent an abrupt shift to a practice\u201d.",

The modest uplift comes after the local bourse added 0.2 per cent on Thursday. The Australian dollar fell below US64\u00a2 and was trading at US63.93\u00a2.\n\nThe announcement of Trump\u2019s first trade deal stoked optimism on Wall Street.

    "text": "The re-election of the Albanese government has led to renewed concern about planned changes to the taxation of investment returns in superannuation funds .\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor\u2019s emphatic victory on Saturday night, including what looks like an increased presence in the Senate, suggests the legislation is likely to become law in the near future.\n\n\n\nRetirement income in Australia\n\nAustralia's retirement income system comprises two pillars: a government-funded age pension as well as private superannuation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper includes compulsory employer-funded contributions as well as additional personal contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two pillars are complementary; a person can receive a pension even if they have private super. But the more super they have, the less pension they are eligible for.\n\n\n\nAbout 70 per cent of superannuation assets are held in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)-regulated funds, and 25 per cent are held in self-managed super funds (SMSFs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two types of tax \u2014 and tax concessions \u2014 on super. First, employer contributions and capped personal contributions are taxed at a concessional rate of 15 per cent. Second, income earned by a super fund is taxed at 15 per cent for balances in the accumulation phase (when contributions are being made). Income earned in the pension phase is tax-free.\n\n\n\nSo what does the proposed reform entail?\n\nStarting 1 July, the government proposes to increase the concessional tax rate on super account earnings in the accumulation phase from 15 per cent to 30 per cent for balances above $3 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose affected \u2014 about 80,000 super account holders, or 0.5 per cent of the total \u2014 will continue to benefit from the existing 15 per cent concessional tax rate on earnings on the first $3 million of their super balance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will also be able to carry forward any loss as an offset against their tax liability in future years.\n\n\n\nConcerns with the proposed reform\n\nConcerns have been raised this reform implies the taxation of unrealised capital gains on assets held in super accounts, such as shares or property, even if they have not been sold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, indeed, a significant departure from the status quo. Both APRA-regulated funds and SMSFs are currently only required to pay capital gains tax once the asset is sold and the gain is crystallised.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move to tax unrealised capital gains is likely to prove particularly onerous for SMSFs. The typical industry super fund has a diversified portfolio of assets of varying liquidity, including significant cash holdings. But SMSF portfolios are often dominated by a large and illiquid asset (one that cannot be easily sold and converted into cash) such as a farm or business property.\n\n\n\nAs a result, an SMSF facing a large unrealised capital gain, say from an increase in property values, may not have sufficient cash flow to pay the associated tax bill. The SMSF trustee might be forced to prematurely sell assets to meet the fund's tax liability.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, former president Joe Biden's 2025 budget included a similar proposal to tax unrealised capital gains for households with more than US$100 million ($155.9 million) in wealth.\n\n\n\nPurpose of the proposed reform\n\nIn announcing this initiative, Treasurer Jim Chalmers suggested the motivation was two-fold.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the federal government is facing pressure on the budget bottom line and generous tax concessions for super are becoming expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, current super tax concessions are highly regressive. This means most benefits of the concessions flow to the wealthiest households which, in any case, will not be eligible for the pension.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of current super concessions to the federal budget is about $50 billion in foregone revenue, according to the Treasury. That is almost the cost of the age pension.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grattan Institute argues superannuation has become a \"taxpayer-funded inheritance scheme\". A Treasury review found most Australians die with large outstanding super balances.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia Retirement Standard calculates that, for a comfortable retirement, a couple needs a super balance of about $700,000 if they retire at age 67. The $3 million threshold is out of the ballpark. However, if the threshold is not indexed, more people will be affected over time.\n\n\n\nSo, is this reform useful?\n\nAccording to the government's Retirement Income Review, the objective of Australia's super system should be to \"deliver adequate standards of living in retirement in an equitable, sustainable and cohesive way\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the proposed tax change aims to improve the equity and sustainability of Australia's super system, it is not clear how it will work in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to SMSF concerns about the difficulty in paying tax bills, the government's proposal gives taxpayers 84 days to pay the tax liability instead of the usual 21 days. This hardly mitigates the risk that SMSF trustees may have to liquidate the main asset in their fund.\n\n\n\nThe Biden proposal had presented an alternative model, allowing for the tax liability to be paid over several years, not all at once. Alternatively, taxpayers could pay an interest-like charge while deferring their unrealised capital gains tax liability.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch alternatives do not appear to have been seriously considered in the Australian government's proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, though, the question must be asked: is taxing volatile unrealised capital gains really the most effective way to improve equity in, and the sustainability of, the superannuation system?\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Melatos is an associate professor of economics at the University of Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Key Points Robert Prevost, a former missionary in Peru, has been elected pope, becoming the first from the US.\n\nHe was chosen by the College of Cardinals despite being relatively unknown globally.\n\nHis election signals continuity with Pope Francis, especially on social justice issues and Church outreach.\n\nRobert Prevost, the choice of the world's Catholic cardinals to serve as leader of the 1.4-billion-member Church, is the first pope from the United States and has little recognition on the global stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAged 69 and originally from Chicago, Prevost has spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given few media interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe takes the papal name Leo XIV, and succeeds Pope Francis , who had led the Church since 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nReverend Mark Francis, a friend of Prevost since the 1970s, told Reuters the cardinal was a firm supporter of his predecessor's papacy, and especially of the late pontiff's commitment to social justice issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was always friendly and warm and remained a voice of common sense and practical concerns for the Church's outreach to the poor,\" said Francis, who attended seminary with Prevost and later knew him when they both lived in Rome in the 2000s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He has a wry sense of humour, but was not someone who sought the limelight,\" said Francis, who leads the US province of the Viatorian religious order.\n\n\n\nPrevost first served as a bishop in Chiclayo, in north-western Peru, from 2015 to 2023, and became a Peruvian citizen in 2015, so he has dual nationality.\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis brought him to Rome that year to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world's bishops.\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus Leon Angeles, coordinator of a Catholic group in Chiclayo who has known Prevost since 2018, called him a \"very simple\" person who would go out of his way to help others.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon Angeles said Prevost had shown special concern for Venezuelan migrants in Peru, saying: \"He is a person who likes to help.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 1.5 million Venezuelans have moved to Peru in recent years, partly to escape their country's economic crisis.\n\n\n\nIn a 2023 interview with the Vatican's news outlet, Prevost focused on the importance of evangelisation to help the Church grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are often preoccupied with teaching doctrine ... but we risk forgetting that our first task is to teach what it means to know Jesus Christ,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevost said during a 2023 Vatican press conference: \"Our work is to enlarge the tent and to let everyone know they are welcome inside the Church.\"\n\n\n\nThe crowd of faithful gathered for the new pontiff, Pope Leo XIV, to celebrate his appointment at the Vatican. Source: AAP / Marco Iacobucci\n\n'He knows how to listen'\n\nPrevost was born in 1955 and is a member of the global Augustinian religious order, which includes about 2,500 priests and brothers, operates in 50 countries and has a special focus on a life of community and equality among its members.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has a bachelor's degree from Villanova University in Philadelphia, a master's from the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, and a doctorate in Church law from the Pontifical College of St Thomas Aquinas in Rome.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevost first went to Peru as a missionary in 1985, returning to the US in 1999 to take up a leadership role in his religious order.\n\n\n\nPrevost later moved to Rome to serve two six-year terms as head of the Augustinians, visiting many of the order's communities across the world. He is known to speak English, Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to Rome in 2023, he generally did not take part in many of the social events that attract Vatican officials throughout the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon Angeles said he is a person with leadership skills: \"But at the same time, he knows how to listen. He has that virtue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cardinal has the courtesy to ask for an opinion, even if it's from the simplest or most humble person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He knows how to listen to everyone.\"\n\n\n\n",

CSIRO and experts take a look SBS News 22/05/2024 07:48 Play\n\nWhat was the Coalition's nuclear policy?\n\nIn mid-2024, then-Opposition leader Peter Dutton announced that if elected, he would create seven nuclear power plants across NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, pledging it would lead to cheaper energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition estimated the project would cost $331 billion and had planned to build the plants in the following electorates:\n\n\n\nLiddell in NSW, electorate of Hunter\n\nMount Piper in NSW, electorate of Calare\n\nTarong in Queensland, electorate of Maranoa\n\nCallide in Queensland, electorate of Flynn\n\nPort Augusta in SA, electorate of Grey\n\nLoy Yang in Victoria, electorate of Gippsland\n\nMuja in WA, electorate of O'Connor\n\nThe party's plan to build the reactors faced opposition from members of the public as well as state premiers who were against nuclear facilities in their home states.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton didn't visit any of the proposed sites during the five-week election campaign.\n\n\n\n'Electoral suicide'\n\nThere were swings against the Coalition in nearly every seat where it proposed a nuclear plant, except for Flynn in Queensland, according to Australian Electoral Commission data.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Labor recorded positive swings in every seat where offshore wind projects have been announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdam Simpson, a senior lecturer in international studies at the University of South Australia, described pro-nuclear policies as unpopular \"electoral suicide\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The many ways Australia will change under Anthony Albanese's second term\n\nBut the Coalition didn't have much of a choice when it came to election promises around energy, Simpson told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Coalition had to come to the election saying something about energy policy if they were going to oppose Labor's policy, and there's not really that many options,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They could have come out and said, 'We're going to use gas and or coal for eternity', but then they would have to abandon their commitment to net zero.\"\n\n\n\nFewer moderates in the party\n\nSimpson said there are a couple of reasons the Coalition could come back with a version of the policy for the next election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In 2022, they lost all those teal seats. They lost a lot of moderate voices from the Liberal Party. And then that's just been exacerbated in this recent election,\" Simpson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are very few voices going to be coming from metropolitan urban areas in the Coalition party room. So that's why I wouldn't be surprised if, after they do the post-election wash-up and assessment of what went wrong, they come out again with another pro-nuclear policy.\"\n\n\n\nSimpson said \"cultural opposition\" is likely another factor, with the Coalition ideologically resistant to a transition to renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They don't particularly believe in climate change, and it's certainly not a priority for them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile nuclear energy could be a policy the Coalition runs again in 2028, Simpson predicted it would cause \"further devastation\" within its remaining metropolitan seats and push the Coalition into the \"electoral wilderness\" for a generation.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian College of Anaesthetists says there are a number of commonly recognised types of pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey include acute pain, cancer pain and chronic non-cancer pain - Including over 200 chronic pain conditions back pain, endometriosis and fibromyalgia among many others.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever type of pain a person is experiencing the effects on all aspects of an individual's life can be profound.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Lorimer Moseley is a professor of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of South Australia and the Chair of PainAdelaide.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this is a vulnerable population group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chronic pain is extraordinarily complex and everyone's chronic pain is theirs. It's not a universal condition that contributes to it. And the things that hinder are different and they're quite individually specific. This is a large group of people who are challenged by chronic pain and they're a group of people that for decades have been on the edges, have been not believed and probably even worse than that have been called malingerers or been told you've just got to snap out of it or it's all on your head.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne in five people in Australia and New Zealand will experience chronic pain at some stage in their lives and it's recognised as a major global health issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrelieved pain can affect every area of a person's life with major social, financial and emotional consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with medication and surgery other treatment techniques include education and psychological treatments such as behaviour and cognitive therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at the University of New South Wales and Neuroscience Research Australia [[NeuRA]] have done a randomised trial focusing on the experiences of people with chronic pain and the role emotional processing plays in managing chronic pain conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Nell Norman Knott is a research fellow and clinical trial manager at the University of New South Wales and Neuroscience Research Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's incredibly emotional. And we see this because people who we see and in the literature we know, they present with heightened levels of worry, they present with low mood. And from an emotional and mental health standpoint, we see increasing levels of anxiety and depression in up to about 80 per cent of people with chronic pain. But the aspect of we are particularly interested in is this concept of emotion dysregulation, which really means difficulties being able to bring up positive emotions and dampen down negative emotions. And increasingly we see in the literature that people with chronic pain have emotion dysregulation as a feature of their condition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study's authors says it doesn't matter which type of pain a person has - because the emotional effects are very similar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study included all types of chronic pain from migraine to chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, musculoskeletal pain, inflammatory pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Moseley says its logical that chronic pain would have a major impact on a person's emotional state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of course it's going to make life more difficult in so many ways, including regulating your emotions. So that's an intuitively sensible link that if you're in a lot of pain, you're under a lot of stress, you're in fear, it's harder to regulate your emotions. What is less intuitive but is equally as important is that it's a two way street. So if for some other reason you struggle to regulate your emotions, then that will probably make pain more impactful and probably make pain worse, such is the complexity of pain. I mean the true story of how pain works inside the human body and brain is extraordinary and points to how much we've got in front of us to solve this problem. But it also raises opportunities for effective treatments, some of which look at all the factors involved, for example, the role of emotions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe randomised trial took place from March 2023 to September 2024 and focused on the experiences of 89 people with chronic pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n45 people received their usual pain management treatments plus a psychological treatment known as Dialectical Behaviour Therapy or DBT.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other half only received their usual pain management therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the sample was small - Dr Norman-Nott says in post treatment questionnaires, D-B-T participants reported positive outcomes compared to those who did not receive the treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we found that there was a significant improvement in emotion dysregulation in people who received pain and emotion therapy compared to those who continue to access the usual treatment. So we also saw that there were significant benefits in people's depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and their wellbeing in that those people that received pain and emotion therapy compared to those who didn't saw significant improvements in all of those areas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA key element of DBT is that it's a type of group therapy, which the report's authors say is incredibly beneficial for people with chronic pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nJanelle has had chronic pain for over 30 plus years and in that time has used opioids to manage her pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says having chronic pain is a very stressful experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been on a lot of opioids and things like that, but I've had nothing or found no course that's been able to help take away the pain or help control the pain at home. And having chronic pain is very emotional and very stressful. I've not really found anyone that's cared about my emotional side of my chronic pain. And as Sylvia and Nell have said, the more emotional you are, the more pain that you have, which is a bit weird, but that's the way it is. And by doing the course, I've been able to learn how to reduce my emotional side of my pain, which has helped my chronic pain in the end.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course covered mindfulness, understanding emotions, naming emotions, how to change emotional responses, and also how to bring up positive emotions so that it reduces vulnerability to intense feelings and stressful situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Lorimer Moseley AO says the key thing to remember about chronic pain is no one strategy works everyone but information from trusted sources is key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The evidence-based guidelines around the world when they list what are the most important treatment approaches for people with chronic pain, they all list education as the first one. And it's easy for us as health professionals or for people challenged by pain to think, well, I don't need more education. But what the evidence clearly shows is that if you can understand a bit more about the true complexity of how pain works, how your pain works and the evidence-based approaches to slowly retraining your hypersensitive pain system, your likelihood of improvement radically improves.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "He plans to revisit the rule when his daughters are around 15, \u201cwhen they\u2019re more mature and when they\u2019re more armed to defend themselves, I suppose, in the event of something happening\u201d. Changing cultural attitudes to sleepovers Gabrielle Hunt, a PhD candidate at Australian Catholic University and a registered psychologist, says more Australian parents are becoming wary of sleepovers. Some are worried about the risk of sexual abuse, says Hunt. Others, she says, are concerned about technology use, and differing family\u2019s rules around devices.\n\nEqually, Hunt acknowledges that sleepovers can be an important stage of development for many children. Loading \u201cSleepovers can be an opportunity to build really close relationships with their peers and develop resilience about being away from home, and having to look after some of those self-care tasks that might otherwise be prompted by mum or dad,\u201d says Hunt. Is there a \u2018right\u2019 age for sleepovers? There is no right age for children to start attending sleepovers, says parenting educator and founder of Connected Parenting Genevieve Muir.\n\nA mother of four boys under 18, Muir does allow sleepovers, but says the right age has varied from child to child. \u201cOne of my kids has a significant speech challenge. I wasn\u2019t going to let him have a sleepover as fast as his older brother because I knew that should something happen, he wouldn\u2019t have the ability to communicate that as well to me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s looking at the skills and where my child is at and thinking, \u2018Well, is my child ready?\u2019 Not just in a \u2018want to go\u2019 capacity, but in an emotional readiness and a self-readiness,\u201d she says. \u201cIt should be a decision that happens between parents and their children in terms of what they both feel comfortable with,\u201d says Hunt.\n\nTheir first sleepover Loading Ahead of a child\u2019s first sleepover, Hunt says it\u2019s important to nail the basics \u2013 like toileting, showering and table customs. Then, make sure your child has an exit strategy should they need one. \u201cIt\u2019s about communicating, \u2018It\u2019s okay if you want to go home\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really common for kids to get to bedtime and miss home or it\u2019s really scary because it\u2019s the first time. So just reassure children that it\u2019s okay if you need to get picked up, even if it\u2019s late,\u201d says Hunt. Loading She recommends ensuring your child knows who to speak with should they need an \u201cout\u201d, or scheduling a time for you to call. She says preparing your child for their first sleepover should start well before the age they are ready. \u201cThe single biggest thing we can do as parents is have open, ongoing, honest conversations about children that empower them,\u201d she says.\n\nHow to talk to the host family Ahead of a sleepover, particularly if it\u2019s your child\u2019s first time with a host family, Hunt recommends talking with the host adults. This includes broaching topics like \u201cwhen is an appropriate bedtime, what your rules and expectations around device use are, and who else is going to be in the home when this sleepover happens,\u201d including if parents might be leaving kids with a babysitter. Consider an \u201ceverything but the sleep\u201d sleepover, where the kids stay up late, have a midnight snack, then return home to sleep. There\u2019s no need to feel uncomfortable asking questions, either, if they can help you and your child feel at ease.\n\nIf the sleepover is with a family you don\u2019t know well, Hunt suggests holding a daytime get-together beforehand. If you are simply not comfortable with a family, always trust your gut, says Muir. Sleepover alternatives If you don\u2019t think your child is ready for sleepovers, there\u2019s no need for them to miss out on the fun. Hunt recommends the \u201ceverything-but-the-sleep sleepover\u201d as an alternative, where kids might have a late night but return home to sleep in their own bed.\n\nMuir suggests talking with your child about why they want to attend a sleepover. Loading \u201cWe can\u2019t really expect a child to understand, \u2018I\u2019m trying to keep you safe\u2019. They don\u2019t care about that. They just want to go on the sleepover.\u201d Instead, try to understand their motives. \u201cIt might be, \u2018We\u2019re going to have a midnight snack and we\u2019ve been talking about it\u2019. So you could say, \u2018Let\u2019s have your friend over, we\u2019ll have a late snack and then I\u2019ll drop them home.\u2019 You can come up with alternatives when you understand what the motive is.\u201d",

    "text": "Two years later, in November 2021, it appeared her seven-year campaign to hold the near-trillion-dollar company to account in a public court had finally stalled, however. Having insisted on representing herself, taking on Tesla\u2019s army of expensive lawyers alone to keep costs down, her defamation case was thrown out. Musk, it seemed, was victorious. But, four years on, his words could come back to haunt him. Despite battling late-stage breast cancer, Balan refused to give up. Last month, the indefatigable mother-of-one won an appeal that reverses the decision \u2013 and opens the way for her explosive claims to be heard in public. \u2018It was not easy to think that my son\u2019s memory of me would be overshadowed because of this scumbag.\u2019 \u201cI cannot wait to see Musk and his goons on the stand and see how they will explain their lies and hate against me for doing the right thing,\u201d posted Balan on X shortly after the decision was handed down on April 14. A fortnight later, speaking from Jacksonville, Florida, she is no less combative.\n\n\u201cWhat a pathetic hypocrite that monster is,\u201d she tells The Telegraph, in a thick Transylvanian accent. \u201cAt the same time, he\u2019s bragging about being the free speech absolutist, he\u2019s paying millions of dollars in legal fees to make sure I never have my day in court.\u201d \u201cI have the evidence for everything,\u201d she adds, claiming that several top executives have agreed to testify in her case, and that Tesla is very much aware of one particularly damning recording. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason Musk is so p-----.\u201d Serious quality and safety concerns Growing up just 15 minutes from Bran Castle, otherwise known as Dracula\u2019s Castle, Balan\u2019s favourite toys as a child were pliers and screwdrivers. While other girls played with dolls, she would often be found with oil on her clothes and in her hair, taking engines and motors apart and putting them together again. Tesla\u2019s stock price is the key to Musk\u2019s business empire and his personal life. Credit: Getty Images\n\nAfter marrying aged 22, she went on to earn a degree in engineering and then moved to Canada in the early noughties. She later joined Boeing to work on the interior of the 787 Dreamliner in Seattle. In 2010, she was hired by Tesla \u2013 still a relatively small company \u2013 to help design the battery pack for the Model S. Well-liked and known for being a hard worker, she solved a crucial problem early on that had baffled managers and was delaying the sedan going into production. In recognition, her initials were etched into the battery pack case, which can still be found on some models. In a court document, Tesla\u2019s lawyers admitted Balan was \u201cat the heart of innovation at Tesla\u201d. Branding Musk an arrogant \u201cspoiled brat\u201d who would constantly flaunt his wealth, her memory is no doubt tainted by subsequent dealings with his lawyers. But aside from some suggestive remarks about the \u201cwell-equipped\u201d girls in the office when she was in earshot, she doesn\u2019t recall any particularly bad run-ins with him. Loading Indeed, it was Musk she turned to directly in 2014 when she first discovered \u201cserious safety and quality\u201d flaws after joining the interior fittings team. In an email, she sidestepped her own line manager and requested a meeting with him to discuss her concerns that the interior floor mats could curl up and interfere with the brake pedal.\n\nHowever, on the day of the meeting with Musk, HR instead allegedly marched her to a \u201cdungeon room\u201d, where two security guards \u201cwith guns and handcuffs around their waist\u201d were told to stay outside \u201cin case she runs away\u201d. She claims she was pressured to resign immediately. Feeling like she had no alternative, Balan signed the paper in front of her, but wrote she was only doing so because she had \u201cdare[d] to speak up\u201d to senior management. Shocked, Balan says she fainted as she was escorted out. Ever since, she has been fighting to clear her name. \u201cThat made my fight with cancer even more difficult,\u201d Balan says. \u201cBecause there were quite a few moments they didn\u2019t know if I would make it. It was not easy to think that my son\u2019s memory of me would forever be overshadowed because of this scumbag.\u201d She reserves particular anger for arbitration agreements. For the first few years, she was unable to fight the claims publicly due to the clause inserted into every Tesla contract. The concept was first introduced in the US in 1925 to relieve the burden on the court system by moving business contract disputes into a separate forum. But their use has mushroomed. Research suggests 80 per cent of the largest US companies have used such agreements in workplace disputes. (They are far less common in the UK, where employees have greater protections.) Such clauses \u2013 which notoriously tend to favour the employer \u2013 are \u201ca back door for nasty corporations to steal freedom of speech\u201d, says Balan.\n\nAfter three years in private arbitration over her removal from the company, Balan was awarded $US350,000) \u2013 \u201cpeanuts\u201d compared to the $US40 million she says the shares she relinquished when she left would now be worth. She was not willing to give up and decided to go public with her claims in 2017. Tesla was incensed. In response to a Huffington Post article which marked the first coverage of her case by the media, bosses demanded a 600-word rebuttal that made claims of \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d by Balan when she was an employee \u2013 despite never having raised these in the arbitration hearings. In 2019, Balan filed her defamation lawsuit, claiming it damaged her reputation and made it near impossible for her to find a job. She alleges it left her effectively blacklisted. On one occasion, a British director at a US company rang her to explain that he\u2019d wanted to hire her but his legal team had intervened, Balan claims. \u201cThey kept calling and threatening people who wanted to hire me that they couldn\u2019t afford to be on the wrong side of Elon Musk,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was worse than having a crazy maniac as an ex-boyfriend.\u201d \u2018Toe to toe with a billionaire bully\u2019 Balan is not the only Tesla whistleblower to find herself at the mercy of Musk\u2019s hardball tactics. In 2018, former Tesla technician Martin Tripp told Business Insider that Tesla was wasting a \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d amount of raw material as it ramped up production of the Model 3. The response? Musk accused Tripp of being a \u201csaboteur\u201d, suing him for $US167 million for allegedly hacking the company\u2019s systems, stealing trade secrets, and leaking information to the media.\n\nTesla even informed police it had received a tip that the former employee might \u201ccome back and shoot people\u201d at the Gigafactory in Nevada where he worked. The sheriff\u2019s investigation concluded \u201cthere was no credible threat\u201d. Tripp insisted he had leaked the information out of legitimate concern and, believing he had been defamed as a would-be mass shooter, countersued. But the case swung Tesla\u2019s way \u2013 with Tripp ordered to pay Tesla $US400,000 in damages in 2020. Balan had raised safety concerns about the firm\u2019s Model S vehicles directly with Musk back in 2014. Credit: AP In Balan\u2019s case, after sending Musk an intent to sue, the defamation claim failed to settle. \u201cOne of my conditions was for them to apologise and admit\u2026 that everything they said was a lie \u2013 and they didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Instead, she says, Musk opted for his favoured weapon \u2013 \u201clawfare\u201d \u2013 and the battle continued. As the richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $US330 billion, Musk is not shy of a legal fight. In 2018, British cave diver Vernon Unsworth, who helped rescue a trapped youth football team from a flooded Thai cave, sued Musk for \u00a3142 million ($293 million). Musk had branded Unsworth a \u201cpedo\u201d on X after the diver criticised his proposal to use a mini-submarine in the rescue as a PR stunt. He willingly went to court to contest the case \u2013 and won. Unsworth\u2019s lawyer subsequently lamented that his client had gone \u201ctoe to toe with a billionaire bully\u201d.\n\nIt makes Balan\u2019s case all the more remarkable. Crucially, early on in the defamation case, a judge ruled all the confidentiality clauses in her Tesla contract could be dropped. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why I can legally talk to you now,\u201d she explains. But by the beginning of 2022, her case had seemed all but over as her claim was thrown out by a judge in California and her arbitration verdict was confirmed, closing the matter. Again, Balan refused to give up and appealed the decision. A week later, she was diagnosed with stage-3B breast cancer. As she underwent treatment, she twice asked for a continuation, where the case is put on hold for a certain period. The second time, Tesla\u2019s lawyers refused, she alleges. \u201cSo when the due date came to file it last January, I was so exhausted, and the treatment was so harsh and powerful, I was barely\u2026\u201d she says, pausing. \u201cMy body was struggling to go to the bathroom. This is how bad I was.\u201d Last month\u2019s decision by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal effectively nullified her arbitration award as a court judgment, reopening the possibility for Balan to pursue her defamation claims in a proper court of law. Though not yet a victory, it is a significant milestone \u2013 and one that is giving other Tesla whistleblowers hope, she says, adding that several have contacted her since the ruling. Loading \u201cEverybody said that it\u2019s impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly a handful of people for so many years actually trusted me that I could do it. But I did it.\u201d How does she feel now? \u201cI\u2019m feeling really happy \u2013 I proved them wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cI proved to them an immigrant woman engineer had the capacity, the brain power, to learn their stupid legal system and actually win. So yeah, I feel pretty damn good.\u201d",

    "text": "Testing revealed that the 23-year-old\u2019s troublesome left hamstring was smaller and weaker than his right. Dr Enda King gave Reid a series of exercises and sent him back to Melbourne. After considerable hard work, the reward Reid often felt he missed out on was suddenly a reality. Zach Reid competes with Collingwood\u2019s Dan Houston in his first Anzac Day game last month. Credit: AFL Photos \u201cI had a full-body scan recently at Olympic Park that compares muscle mass, and now I\u2019m equal, left and right, and I haven\u2019t had any hammy issues since,\u201d he said. Where the trouble started Essendon selected Reid, then barely 19 years old, to play his first AFL game in round five of his debut season against a Brisbane Lions team that had signed ex-Bombers star Joe Daniher.\n\nHe felt sick that week, but thought it was a common cold, or the flu at worst. Reid was wrong, and his health deteriorated rapidly in the days after playing. Loading \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m not giving up this opportunity to play my first game\u2019, so I went up there pretty sick already, and then I played, and I think that just tipped me over the edge,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThe exhaustion of playing your first AFL game is hard enough as it is, but when you\u2019ve got glandular fever \u2013 which I didn\u2019t know at the time \u2013 [it is even harder]. After that, I went downhill. The next week was Anzac Day. It was a dream to play Anzac Day, and I was going to get my opportunity in my first year. I\u2019ve missed every Anzac Day until this year.\u201d Reid, whose draft season was wiped out by the COVID-19 pandemic, was bedridden for weeks, but eventually made it back on the training track. Only weeks in, scans revealed a stress fracture in his lower back.\n\n\u201cI think being in bed for ages, and then coming back to an AFL program, on top of missing so much footy during COVID, didn\u2019t help a growing body,\u201d he said. That ended Reid\u2019s season after just one senior match. Bone stress in the sesamoid bone in his right foot in the ensuing pre-season was just a minor nuisance in comparison. Reid was otherwise injury free in 2022, adding seven senior games and 12 in the VFL. But by December that year, his back stress fractures returned. \u201cThat was really flattening,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were trying to help, and saying, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve got 10 years ahead of you; don\u2019t worry about it\u2019 \u2013 but I think the average [AFL] career length is four years. I was like, \u2018You don\u2019t have a crystal ball, so you can\u2019t really say that\u2019.\n\n\u201cMy mindset back then was, \u2018Poor me; why is this happening to me?\u2019. You think when you\u2019re a top-10 pick, you\u2019re going to come in, and it\u2019s going to go smoothly, but then you get hit in the face with some adversity.\u201d Learning to better handle his setbacks, which Reid said came with maturity and perspective \u2013 \u201cIt could be a lot worse. I could be homeless\u201d \u2013 proved crucial. His three hamstring injuries, all on his left leg, and a ruptured left pectoral muscle were still to come. Zach Reid\u2019s wretched injury history 2021: Reid diagnosed with glandular fever after making his AFL debut in round five against Brisbane Lions. Three months later, after being bedridden then rebuilding his fitness, scans reveal he has a stress fracture in his lower back. 2022: Bone stress is detected in the sesamoid bone of his right foot in pre-season. He wears orthotics to remedy the issue, and plays most of the season between the AFL and VFL. 2023: Another back stress fracture interrupts his pre-season and delays his season start. Shortly after returning in the VFL, Reid suffers a T-junction hamstring injury in his left leg that sidelines him for six weeks. In testing ahead of his planned VFL return, the injury flares up, prompting season-ending surgery. 2024: Suffers a left hamstring strain - in a different area to the previous two - in Essendon\u2019s round one win over Hawthorn. It costs him seven games, then in the fourth match of his comeback in the VFL, an opponent crashes into him, rupturing his left pectoral muscle, leading to another operation. The latter was a freak injury in a VFL match, where Reid went to tackle a Box Hill opponent who \u201csteamrolled\u201d through his arm and ruptured the injury-cursed Bomber\u2019s pec. Season-ending surgery followed. Playing on Anzac Day was not Reid\u2019s only highlight this season. He also had the chance to share the field with, and play directly on, his brother, West Coast forward-ruck Archer.\n\n\u201cI was the perfect match-up for him,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe both didn\u2019t really have any impact, so it was funny, but it was good that it was close. It made it entertaining for our parents.\u201d The Reid brothers, Zach and Archer, played against each other in round six. Credit: AFL Photos Reid insists the only change now he is playing regularly is the extra attention from media and fans, some of whom thank him for being a \u201cbargain buy\u201d in fantasy football. \u201cI\u2019m outperforming my price, so that\u2019s the main thing fans are grateful for,\u201d he said, smiling.",

    "text": "There is only one positional unit in the British and Irish Lions squad announced overnight on Thursday in which an Englishman is not present, and even that might be a moot point with Northampton winger Tommy Freeman capable of playing in the No.13 jersey if Huw Jones (Scotland) or Garry Ringrose (Ireland) are injured.\n\nNot even the Irish can claim that spread of players throughout the squad, with No.10s Sam Prendergast and Jack Crowley notably omitted in favour of England\u2019s Fin Smith and Marcus Smith.\n\nThe squad shows that Lions coach Andy Farrell has been smart and flexible enough to see a late shift in the power dynamics between the Lions nations, with brilliant 20-year-old flanker Henry Pollock also rewarded for a brilliant performance in Northampton\u2019s win against Leinster in Dublin last weekend.\n\nNone of this is good news for the Wallabies. The earlier prospect of an underwhelming Lions squad was based on the premise that Ireland had plateaued, and while that is arguably still true it did not factor in an England rise.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size When does a dynasty die? There is no knowing when the end begins. Ivan Cleary, coach of the Panthers \u2013 who have won the past four NRL premierships but are now on a lowly ladder position, says, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure of the exact definition of a dynasty. Have we had one, or are we still in one at Penrith? There is no such thing as a machine in perpetual motion. At some point, you\u2019ve got to stop for fuel.\u201d He agrees the continual loss of players in the salary cap era, including three top-class ones at the end of the 2024 season \u2013 James Fisher-Harris, their physically dominant forward leader; Jarome Luai, the attacking foil for his own son, Nathan, and Sunia Turuva, a first-half tryscorer in last year\u2019s grand final - helps drain the tank. As will the coming loss of co-captain Isaah Yeo, Liam Martin, Cleary and possibly fullback Dylan Edwards to the NSW team, making it difficult to win enough games to make this year\u2019s top eight. Nor did results up to Magic Round suggest their replacements, despite being the product of the NRL\u2019s best assembly line, would help the Panthers peat, let alone five-peat. \u201cAll that adds to it possibly ending,\u201d says Cleary, on the eve of his team\u2019s comprehensive 32-8 win over the Broncos in Brisbane. The victory is a timely warning that it is foolish to proclaim the death of a dynasty. Ivan and Nathan Cleary after winning their fourth premiership. Credit: Getty Images There is no voice of doom from the top of the Blue Mountains saying the club is slipping down to the lowlands where the also-rans live. Melbourne is described as a dynasty, yet the club has never won consecutive premierships. If Cleary has doubts about the end of a dynasty, he has certainty about its beginning . When the Panthers were beaten 26-20 by Melbourne in the 2020 grand final, he told reporters, \u201cI\u2019d love to have the game tomorrow, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about it now, he says, \u201cI genuinely meant it. I felt like we ran out of time. I felt like I\u2019d like to have the first half again and it would have been enough. Although the play-offs had been tight, everything in the grand final went faster. The Storm\u2019s line speed was fantastic. We made a few mistakes. Nathan threw an intercept and couldn\u2019t get it out of his head. But I also thought at the time that this is part of the journey. And it was.\u201d If there are any doubts this was the game that motivated Penrith, the Panthers players made it obvious in their redemptive victory over Melbourne last year. It has never been previously reported but some of the Storm\u2019s younger players were shocked at the vitriol Penrith spewed at them as they stood behind the posts after a try. Luai had not forgotten the \u201cget back to Mount Druitt\u201d slur from the Storm\u2019s Jahrome Hughes. The Fibro versus Silvertail ethos of under-privilege persists in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs and Cleary, who has lived in Penrith for 14 years and still owns a house in the northern beaches, makes no apology for any sledging. \u201cIt was still remembered,\u201d he said. \u201cWe learnt a lot from the 2020 grand final, including a lot of stuff that happened off the ball.\u201d Cleary had coached more than 370 games by the time he won his first premiership. He had previously coached the Warriors, Panthers and Wests Tigers before returning to Penrith. Ivan Cleary in his first year of coaching the Warriors in 2006. Credit: David White It sounds ludicrous to suggest a man with all that experience, including taking the Warriors to the 2011 grand final, would grow as a coach along with his young team but he agrees. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d he says. \u201cMy career had all been about rebuild. By the time I got back to Penrith, it was the first time I actually thought I had a team that could win a grand final. I could see green shoots and blue sky.\u201d He admits he feared for his reputation. \u201cI wondered whether I would be the guy who was only known for dragging teams up out of the gutter and not reaching the top. I have definitely grown as coach along the way with these players.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenrith have led a tactical revolution in the NRL, using their back five to create field position and hence balance the energy output of backs and forwards. \u201cPart of that decision was personnel,\u201d says Cleary with reference to the power of the now injured winger Brian To\u2019o and fullback Edwards returning the ball to near halfway. \u201cThe beauty of the back five is that they can get the forwards thinking about defence. All our stats in the game are about attack but I\u2019ve always believed defence wins games and attack decides by how much.\u201d Some observers believe the Panthers led in exploiting the six-again rule by deliberately conceding breaches early in the tackle count to trap a team in its own 40-metre zone. \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t do it deliberately,\u201d Cleary says. \u201cWe place a lot of emphasis on controlling the ruck and line speed but the breaches weren\u2019t deliberate.\u201d He does admit to introducing the ruse of blockers preventing opposition players from hurrying the kicker. The Storm\u2019s Christian Welch was particularly effective harassing Nathan in the 2020 grand final and Penrith\u2019s sophisticated blocking system was the response. \u2018I wondered whether I would be the guy who was only known for dragging teams up out of the gutter and not reaching the top\u2019 Ivan Cleary \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment,\u201d Cleary says, before conceding the NRL subsequently did the job for him by penalising any player who makes contact with a kicker. \u201cHalves now have a level of protection on kicks.\u201d He also pleads guilty to the recent scrum ploy of the half placing the ball on the ground and retreating to first receiver in the backline, while a scrum player picks it up and feeds the ball. Insofar as it adds a man to the backline, it creates an overlap. \u201cThe Roosters did it to us and scored a try,\u201d Cleary admits. He wasn\u2019t resentful he had been punished by his own invention. \u201cI thought at the time, \u2018That is pretty cool, too.\u2019\u201d He explains the ploy came in response to the NRL ban on teams holding the ball at the base of the scrum. \u201cA lot of scrum tries came from that but the NRL stopped it and now they have done it again by making us re-start the scrum feed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he concedes the NRL\u2019s relentless mission to increase ball in play time by reducing stoppages has benefitted Penrith and Melbourne. \u201cThe continuity has helped us,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThe six-again rule has been good for us but most of the calls you don\u2019t know what they are for.\u201d He echoes the complaint of all coaches that referees can use repeat sets to even up a game. He welcomes a review of the salary cap, saying, \u201cPenrith doesn\u2019t get any rewards for players developed in our pathways going to other clubs as NRL players. We are doing a good job for the NRL producing players.\u201d Luai left after four premierships, including leading the team last year in place of an injured Nathan who also missed NSW\u2019s Origin winning series in which Luai played a stellar role. Asked if the Panthers under-valued the five-eighth, Cleary said, \u201cI definitely did not under-estimate him. We fought tooth and nail to keep him. We couldn\u2019t get near the money he was offered plus he wanted to forge his own path. I\u2019m proud of what he is doing at Wests Tigers but I wish he was here.\u201d Like his colleagues, he rails against the NRL draw which resembles something dreamed up by muppets Ernie and Bert. Penrith\u2019s Origin players are required to play a 3pm match on a Saturday in Auckland after the Wednesday evening Origin encounter in Perth. \u201cThey [Penrith\u2019s Origin representatives] won\u2019t be playing in Auckland,\u201d Cleary said.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Nathan and Ivan Cleary after Penrith lost the 2020 grand final. Credit: Getty So, let\u2019s go back to that 2020 grand final - the beginning of the Penrith dynasty. Would Cleary have liked a time-out, as they have in US sports, where a coach can stop the game and settle the players. \u201cIf we were able to have them, that\u2019s the sort of game where it would have helped,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the NRL we have time-outs for things we don\u2019t want time-outs for.\u201d As he sits in the coach\u2019s box at games, awaiting the Bunker\u2019s decision, he looks composed while his rivals stress and fume. \u201cUnderneath the surface, I ride all the highs and lows, just like the other coaches,\u201d he reveals.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Having won their semi-final tie 5-1 on aggregate over Bodo/Glimt, Spurs are into the Europa League final against Manchester United. So Postecoglou is 90 minutes away - maybe 120 - from having dropped one of the coldest quotes in modern football history. The psychological burden of Tottenham\u2019s 15-year trophy drought, which has weighed so heavily on this club, could be finally discarded. Ange Postecoglou in Bodo. Credit: nna\\seathompson By a man who, if certain reports are to be believed, will be discarded by the club regardless. Indeed, the question of his future remains - but it shouldn\u2019t. It is a ludicrous notion that a decision about whether Postecoglou is the right man to lead Spurs into the future, or at least the third year of his four-year contract, should hinge on a single fixture. It\u2019s even sillier if it\u2019s already been made.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly no glossing over how poor their Premier League season has been, and how inexplicably bad some of their performances have been in it. But there\u2019s enough evidence, if you want to see it, in how they\u2019ve performed in the Europa League, and how Postecoglou has set them up tactically, and how the players are responding to him, to suggest that there\u2019s still something in this project that is worth pursuing. The unity in the Tottenham camp - as captured by the club\u2019s channels, who posted his stirring post-match address to the players on social media - speaks for itself. Any other manager in these circumstances, and with those results, would have lost not only the dressing room but their own head long ago. Yves Bissouma leads the post-match celebrations. Credit: Getty Images Not Postecoglou. There\u2019s been some evidence of fraying, but fundamentally, he\u2019s kept it together. The biggest challenge for him at Spurs was never about wins and losses. It was about changing the mentality of this football club, about getting rid of the \u2018Spursy\u2019 tag. And he\u2019s doing it, bit by bit, challenging not only the external conversation about Tottenham but also their own internal self-defeating perceptions.\n\nLike the trips to Eintracht Frankfurt and AZ Alkmaar earlier in the tournament, many fans were petrified about the prospect of playing north of the Arctic Circle on a plastic pitch against a team in Bodo/Glimt with a giant-slaying record. In the end, there was nothing to be worried about. The players couldn\u2019t have been more focused. Postecoglou, too, has probably learned some things along the way. There\u2019s no doubt that Spurs are playing more pragmatic football in the Europa League than those who follow his teams would expect to see. His sides hardly ever launch it long from goal kicks; Tottenham did almost exclusively that in Bodo. Circumstances dictated it, as he explained afterwards, but there have been plenty of other times in his career where circumstances also dictated it, and he didn\u2019t go down this path. Why now, and not then? One for him to answer. Either way, those who knocked him earlier in the season for having no \u201cPlan B\u201d and never changing his tactics are quiet now. Pre-match, Postecoglou essentially laughed off the suggestion from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger - the ex-Arsenal manager, so not a disinterested party - that the Europa League winners didn\u2019t deserve to qualify for the UEFA Champions League the following season because the then-likely finalists Spurs and Man United were doing so poorly in the Premier League. They sit 16th and 15th respectively on the table.\n\nLoading Post-match, Postecoglou again took aim at the notion that people were \u201cfearing\u201d the prospect of Spurs actually winning something for once, and thus were working ahead of time to diminish their achievement before it happens. \u201cI could have been sitting here at exactly the same time in fifth position, and I can guarantee that the commentary around me would be: \u2018Well, that\u2019s great Ange, but this club needs to win something.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly what everyone would be saying,\u201d he said, calling the hypocrites out directly. \u201cSo of course it\u2019s massive. You have to frame it against what this club has been through over the last 15 or 20 years and what the supporters have been through.\u201d What they\u2019ve all been through this year, painful as it\u2019s been, might yet prove to be worth it.",

    "text": "The central bank will release its report on surcharging shortly, and the government will then decide whether to ban debit surcharges, while seeking to not disproportionately hurt small businesses. \u201cWe\u2019re cracking down on unfair and excessive card surcharges to get a better deal for Australians and small businesses,\u201d a spokesman for Treasurer Jim Chalmers said. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to ban debit card surcharges subject to the further work under way now by the Reserve Bank if there are sufficient safeguards to ensure both small businesses and consumers can benefit from lower costs.\u201d The Reserve says small businesses can be charged a whopping three times more in transaction fees than larger merchants.\n\nThe hospitality industry warns that menu prices will have to rise if businesses can no longer recover the cost of debit card payments from customers, saying a coffee that now costs $5.08 with a card surcharge might rise to $5.50. \u201cOf course it will be inflationary,\u201d said Wes Lambert, chief executive of the Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association. \u201cRemoving a debit surcharge will translate directly to the bottom line. And to mitigate this drop in profit, we\u2019ll see a sharp increase in prices much greater than 8\u00a2 that we currently pay on a cup of coffee. We\u2019ll be rounding that [price rise] to 10\u00a2, 20\u00a2 or even 50\u00a2.\u201d The Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association, the Australian Hotels Association and the Australian Lottery & Newsagents Association are lobbying the Reserve Bank against a ban. Card surcharging is more common in cafes, restaurants and pubs than in other sectors, the Reserve said. But Ebstein said the removal of surcharges would have a negligible effect on consumer prices and that any ensuing price rises by businesses would be opportunistic. He said the cost to merchants of accepting cards had reduced significantly since the Reserve first allowed surcharging in 2013.\n\nEbstein, of MWE Consulting, said businesses should regard card payment costs as another cost of being in business. \u201cYou don\u2019t charge someone an extra bit because you\u2019ve just done an advertising campaign, or you\u2019ve just paid your electricity bill,\u201d he said. \u201cCard costs actually reduce your overall costs because 30 years ago you were maintaining accounts for customers, there was a cost; most of your payments were in cash, there was a cost.\u201d Palace Cinema chief executive Benjamin Zeccola. Credit: Jason South Palace Cinemas chief executive Benjamin Zeccola said banning card surcharges would do \u201cserious damage to the sectors driving economic activity and employment\u201d. Surcharging helped businesses recover their costs transparently, Zeccola said.\n\n\u201cIf government reform eliminates that transparent mechanism without care, it\u2019s not cutting \u2018junk fees\u2019 \u2013 it is foisting them invisibly onto small businesses, pushing prices up, or worse, tipping fragile businesses over the edge,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s inflationary, not protective.\u201d Family-run book retailer the Book Depot goes against the norm by not charging the surcharge at the point of sale. \u201cAll of us find it annoying as consumers and so have avoided inflicting it on our customers,\u201d co-owner Tony Sidebottom said. \u201cWe also try and offer the cheapest books in the marketplace and this message doesn\u2019t sit comfortably alongside the surcharge.\u201d Sidebottom said the Book Depot regarded the surcharge as just another cost, like electricity. Tony Sidebottom of the Book Depot, which does not apply a surcharge at the point of sale. Credit: Paul Jeffers\n\n\u201cThe consumer pays for it anyway, really. With our business, our margins reduce very slightly but when we\u2019re considering pricing decisions, it\u2019s something we take into account.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said misleading surcharging practices were a compliance and enforcement priority. It regularly received tip-offs about alleged excessive surcharging, particularly by small and micro-businesses, it said. But big companies are not immune to excessive card surcharging. The competition watchdog said Europcar, Fitness First and Nine Entertainment, owner of The Age, had been financially penalised for charging surcharges that were greater than their costs. The Australian Banking Association said consumers \u201cshould always know the cost of an item before they pay for it\u201d. The association said while it wanted to see less surcharging, prohibiting it \u201cwould represent an abrupt shift to a practice\u201d.",

But Trump oversells everything. In that sense, he is the quintessential American, in direct contrast to the British tradition of understatement.\n\nDonald Trump listens to Britain\u2019s US ambassador Peter Mandelson in the Oval Office.

Not only is he portraying this as a massive win for British workers, but he described it as a historic moment between the two countries, up there with VE Day, which occurred on the same day 80 years ago.\n\nWell, an armistice it ain\u2019t. This is a list of concessions more than a trade deal, and one in which the UK is still subject to billions worth of tariffs that didn\u2019t exist last year.",

    "text": "Limited parking in urban areas across Australia continues to cause tension among EV and non-EV drivers.\n\nA resident slammed the decision to keep precious on-street parking limited to only EV charging. Source: Facebook/C Jones\n\nAs councils race to install electric vehicle (EV) chargers across Australian suburbs to keep up with growing demand, prime parking locations are being snapped up for the new infrastructure \u2013 and some locals aren't happy about the disappearing parking options in their community as a result.\n\nThis is the case in one inner-city suburb of Sydney, where a resident claims two EV-designated parking bays are consistently vacant. Seeking the opinion of others in a local community group, he complained that he often has to park further away and walk to amenities, only to pass the parking bays which are frequently sitting empty.\n\n\"Day four of two electric vehicle-only spots not being used,\" the Leichhardt resident posted online.\n\n\"Two key parking and drop-off spots for residents, small businesses and most importantly right out the front of a local GP and pathology.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter legislation was introduced in November 2022, it became a fineable offence for drivers of petrol engine vehicles to park in allocated charging bays, with a potential fine of up to $2,200. The practice is often referred to as 'ICEing'.\n\nCouncil steadfast on providing more EV charging bays\n\nWith parking availability becoming increasingly more limited in urban areas, the introduction of EV-only bays is exacerbating the already existent disdain some drivers have towards the cars. Yahoo News has previously reported on the limited parking in Leichhardt, with some residents choosing to illegally reserve on-street parking in a bid to secure a spot outside their home.\n\nHowever, the local council remains steadfast that it is required to provide infrastructure for EV drivers. A spokesperson for the Inner West City council told Yahoo it has \"rolled out the largest number of kerbside EV charging stations of any council in the nation\" and there will be \"more to come\".\n\nThe local council touts itself as the \"EV capital of Australia\" and currently has installed 102 public EV chargers, with 34 more to be rolled out by the end of June.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe council has rolled out more than 100 new charges in recent years. But petrol powered cars must keep them free. Source: Facebook/C Jones\n\nHow is the location of EV charging bays chosen?\n\nThere are many considerations when choosing the location of an EV charging bay, including the power grid capacity of the site, safety considerations, locations of other chargers and adjacent land uses.\n\nWhen the council was questioned about the perceived prioritisation of parking for EVs over non-EVs, the spokesperson confirmed to Yahoo a council review will commence to gather insight into whether their strategy has worked, and how it can be improved moving forward.\n\n\"This data is not currently available. However, a utilisation study is intended to commence six months after the final charger is operational,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

    "text": "US expat Garrett said the uncommon discovery signals a larger change taking place in China.\n\nUS expat Garrett discovered Aussie beef at a grocery store in China after Trump's tariffs effectively halted trade between the two countries. Source: TikTok/Theforeignerlife\n\nA US expat living in China made a surprising discovery at a local supermarket, signalling a major shift in the favour of Australia amid an increasingly unstable global environment.\n\nGarrett, who is originally from Boston but lives in Shanghai, told Yahoo News he was recently grocery shopping when he stumbled upon a packet of minced beef from Australia.\n\nWhile that might not mean much to many, it comes just one month after the Trump administration sent shockwaves through the entire world when he announced reciprocal tariffs on just about every country on April 2, a day he called \"Liberation Day\".\n\nAustralia's beef industry was singled out with Trump declaring, \"[Australia] won\u2019t take any of our beef\" due to our tough biosecurity rules.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the announcement also caused a grinding halt to America's $2.5 billion beef trade to China \u2014 after the country copped the largest tariff of 145 per cent. China countered imposing tariffs on US imports of 125 per cent.\n\nThe price pressure on US meat exports followed China not renewing the registration of hundreds of US meat facilities. These factors have combined to halt US beef imports into China, and Australia's beef industry has benefitted significantly with it set for a record-breaking $13.9 billion in sales in 2024\u201325, a 12 per cent increase from the previous record set the year prior.\n\nOf the discovery at a \"high-end\" store in a shopping mall in Shanghai, Garrett said he had been unaware of Australian beef being \"commonly available\" compared to meat from the US.\n\n\"On this particular visit, I was shopping for ingredients to make beef ragu and noticed a package labelled as Australian beef,\" he said. \"It caught my attention,\" he said.\n\nGarret, who shared a video about the discovery, said; \"The whole idea that China is hurting because of the tariffs... they\u2019re not because they\u2019re buying it from other places, because they\u2019re not as dependent on the US,\" he said, adding, \"They\u2019ll just go elsewhere.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGarrett said he \"trusts Australia more than America\" with the quality of the minced wagyu beef, which cost 46 Chinese yuan (A$9.90).\n\nThe last time Garrett remembers seeing American beef in local grocery stores was about a month ago, around the time the tariffs were introduced.\n\n\"From what I understand, food quality standards and regulations in the US are comparatively lower, and the use of chemicals and additives in cattle feed and meat processing is a concern for me,\" he said.\n\n\"Overall, I trust Australia\u2019s regulatory approach, which seems to prioritise quality and safety over profit,\" he said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's trade announcement was intended to 'make America wealthy again'. Source: Getty\n\nAustralia 'well placed' to handle US tariff instability\n\nInitially, Australia faced a 10 per cent tariff on goods and while it fared better than most, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described it as \u201cunwarranted\u201d at the time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, China received tariffs of up to 145 per cent and in retaliation, imposed a minimum 125 per cent tariff on US goods.\n\nAustralia\u2019s other trading partners, including the European Union, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea, faced tariffs ranging from 20 to 52 per cent. These tariffs were temporarily suspended for 90 days to allow countries other than China time to negotiate with the US.\n\nWhile financial markets initially responded shakily, earlier this week, big four bank Westpac's chief executive Anthony Miller said despite the uncertainty from Trump's global tariff crackdown, Australia is likely to weather the storm. \"Australia is well placed to handle the instability,\" he said on Monday.\n\nHow did the Chinese react to Trump's tariff announcement?\n\nSpeaking of the reaction in China to the US tariffs, Garrett said his Chinese friends and colleagues responded with \"raised eyebrows and a shrug\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The discussions I heard focused on facts and figures, particularly regarding the US\u2019s reliance on Chinese goods versus the reverse,\" he said.\n\nHe believes that while the tariffs have \"certainly had an impact\" on both sides, \"most people in China haven't felt a direct impact\".\n\n\"Few Chinese consumers heavily rely on American-made products, which left many of my friends puzzled by the rationale behind the tariffs,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
