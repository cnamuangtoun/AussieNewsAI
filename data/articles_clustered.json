    "text": "A retirement crisis hiding in plain sight could be coming for millions of Australians, with new research revealing a worrying lack of superannuation contributions among the country's smallest business owners.\n\nIn a national survey of small business operators, most of whom ran businesses with four employees or fewer, AMP Bank found 55 per cent of respondents contributed \"regularly\" to their own super.\n\nThat means close to half of the owners in that sector do not, opting to prioritise reinvesting in their business or managing cash flow.\ufeff\n\nAlmost half of Australia's small business owners don't contribute to their super regularly, according to new research. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBy contrast, about 90 per cent of the Australian workforce receives guaranteed superannuation, now increased to 12 per cent.\ufeff\n\nSuper contributions are not compulsory for the self-employed, and sole traders make up the majority of Australian business owners.\n\nBut the neglect of super contributions is fuelling a growing retirement savings gap.\ufeff\n\nAMP's modelling showed that even $100 of super per week from age 30, assuming a 6 per cent annual return, would \ufeffamount to more than $500,000 by age 65.\n\n\"It's understandable that many small business owners prioritise reinvesting in their business, which can mean super contributions fall by the wayside,\" AMP Bank GO director John Arnott said.\n\n\"In the early stages, cash flow is often tight \u2013 paying a wage, let alone contributing regularly to super, can be a real challenge.\"\n\nWant a pay rise? These jobs experienced the fastest salary growth this year View Gallery\n\nHowever, he urged small business owners and sole traders to \"strike the right balance\" between short-term and long-term goals, and to make use of tools available to streamline the process.\n\n\"Time is precious, and the admin and mental load are very real. Resources like the ATO's website and your banking app can help automate processes, and provide valuable cash flow insights, visibility, and control,\" he said.\n\n\"And importantly, understand how to make the most of the super system.\n\n\"It offers significant tax advantages for long-term investing, and even small, regular contributions can grow substantially over time thanks to the power of compounding.\"",

(Getty)\n\n9news.com.au contacted Microsoft Australia to ask how many Australian workers the lay-offs would impact.\n\nIt was unable to provide \ufeffa number but issued a statement saying the company would continue to \"implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace\".\n\nMicrosoft said the cuts will affect multiple teams around the world, including its sales division, part of the \"organisational changes\".\n\nThe company won't say the total number of layoffs except that it was about 4 per cent of the workforce it had a year ago.\n\nA memo to gaming division employees today from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer said the cuts would position the video game business \"for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas\".\n\nXbox would \"follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,\" Spencer wrote.\n\nMicrosoft employed 228,000 full-time workers as of June 2024, the last time it reported its annual headcount.\n\nIts latest layoffs would cut fewer than 4 per cent of that workforce, according to Microsoft.\n\nREAD MORE: Burning truck shuts down major Sydney motorway\n\nThe tech giant began sending out layoff notices that hit the company's Xbox video game business and other divisions. (Getty)\n\nBut it has already had at least three layoffs this year and it's unlikely that new hiring has matched the amount lost.\n\nEither way, a 4 per cent cut would amount to somewhere in the range of 9000 people.\n\nUntil now, this year's biggest layoff was in May, when Microsoft began laying off about 6000 workers, nearly 3 per cent of its global workforce and its largest job cuts in more than two years.\n\nThe cutbacks come as Microsoft continues to invest huge amounts of money in the data centres, specialised computer chips and other infrastructure needed to advance its AI ambitions.\n\nThe company anticipated those expenses would cost it about $US80 billion ($121 billion) in the last fiscal year.\n\nIts new fiscal year began on Tuesday.\n\nMicrosoft just last month cut another 300 workers based out of its Redmond headquarters, on top of nearly 2000 who lost their jobs in the Puget Sound region in May, most of them in software engineering and product management roles, according to information it sent to Washington state employment officials.\n\nMicrosoft says it is laying off about 9000 workers, its second mass layoff in months. (Getty)\n\nMicrosoft's chief financial officer Amy Hood said on an April earnings call that the company was focused on \"building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers\".\n\nThe company has repeatedly characterised its recent layoffs as part of a push to trim management layers, but the May focus on cutting software engineering jobs has fueled worries about how the company's own AI code-writing products could reduce the number of people needed for programming work.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said earlier this year that \"maybe 20, 30 per cent of the code\" for some of Microsoft's coding projects \"are probably all written by software\".\n\nThe latest layoffs, however, seemed centred on slower-growing areas of the company's business, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\n\n\"They're focused more and more on AI, cloud and next-generation Microsoft and really looking to cut costs around Xbox and some of the more legacy areas,\" Ives said.\n\n\"I think they overhired over the years. This is Nadella and team making sure that they're keeping with efficiency and that's the name of the game in Wall Street.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What Qantas customers should do next following the cyberattack\n\nThe trimming of the Xbox staff follows Microsoft's years-long expansion of the business surrounding its gaming console, culminating in 2023 with the $US75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard \u2014 the California-based maker of hit franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush.\n\nBefore that, in a bid to compete with Sony's PlayStation, it spent $US7.5 billion to acquire ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Maryland-based video game publisher Bethesda Softworks.",

Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nHowever she believes miscommunication and an error in documentation meant officials didn't believe her mother was under full-time employment.\n\n9news.com.au has contacted the Department of Immigration regarding the missing written decision.\ufeff\n\nSumni and her husband Eun Kyo Lee run an end-of-lease cleaning business in Melbourne.\n\nSophia said her mother Sumni kept full-time hours in accordance with her visa conditions.\n\n\"Mum did fulfil that prerequisite and we had evidence to back it up,\" Sophia said.\n\n\"So now, we're just kind of stuck in limbo.\"\n\nSophia said language barriers and poor translation meant her parents couldn't properly resolve the issue.\n\nThe family claim they provided additional records proving they met the requirements for the visa but their case was not successful.\ufeff\n\nTheir appeal has been rejected by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) several times.\n\nPictured: Eun Kyo Lee, Sumni Park and their three children Sophia, Sehun and Yesol.

    "text": "The Dalai Lama has announced that he will have a successor after his death, continuing a centuries-old tradition that has become a flashpoint in the struggle with China's Communist Party over Tibet's future.\n\nTibetan Buddhism's spiritual leader made the declaration on Wednesday in a video message to religious elders gathering in Dharamshala, India , where the Nobel Peace laureate has lived since fleeing Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese communist rule in 1959.\n\n\"I am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\" the Dalai Lama said in the pre-recorded video, citing requests he received over the years from Tibetans and Tibetan Buddhists urging him to do so.\n\nAttendant monks help Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to leave after presiding over an event celebrating his 90th birthday according to a Tibetan calendar at the Tsuglakhang temple in Dharamshala, India, Monday, June 30, 2025, ahead of his birthday according to the Gregorian calendar on July 6. (AP Photo/Ashwini Bhatia)\n\n\"The Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognise the future reincarnation; no one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\" he added, using the formal name for the office of the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe office should carry out the procedures of search and recognition of the future dalai lama \"in accordance with past tradition\", he said, without revealing further details on the process.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has previously stated that when he is about 90 years old, he will consult the high lamas of Tibetan Buddhism and the Tibetan public to re-evaluate whether the institution of the dalai lama should continue.\n\nWednesday's announcement \u2013 delivered days before his 90th birthday this Sunday \u2013 sets the stage for a high-stakes battle over his succession, between Tibetan leaders in exile and China's atheist Communist Party, which insists it alone holds the authority to approve the next dalai lama.\n\nREAD MORE: Australian government reveals bombshell Kanye West decision\n\nTibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama presides over an event celebrating his 90th birthday according to a Tibetan calendar at the Tsuglakhang temple in Dharamshala, India, Monday, June 30, 2025, ahead of his birthday according to the Gregorian calendar on July 6. (AP Photo/Ashwini Bhatia)\n\nAsked about the Dalai Lama's statement, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry reiterated Beijing's long-held stance that the spiritual leader's reincarnation must comply with Chinese laws and regulations, with search and identification conducted in China and approved by the central government.\n\nIn a memoir published in March, the Dalai Lama states that his successor will be born in the \"free world\" outside China, urging his followers to reject any candidate selected by Beijing.\n\nThat could lead to the emergence of two rival dalai lamas: one chosen by his predecessor, the other by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\"Both the Tibetan exile community and the Chinese government want to influence the future of Tibet, and they see the next dalai lama as the key to do so,\" said Ruth Gamble, an expert in Tibetan history at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nSamdhong Rinpoche, a senior official at the Dalai Lama's office, told reporters on Wednesday that any further information about the procedures or methods of the Dalai Lama's reincarnation would not be revealed to the public until the succession takes place.\n\nTibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama attends an event celebrating his 90th birthday according to a Tibetan calendar at the Tsuglakhang temple in Dharamshala, India, Monday, June 30, 2025, ahead of his birthday according to the Gregorian calendar on July 6. (AP Photo/Ashwini Bhatia)\n\nStruggle over succession\n\nOver a lifetime in exile, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has become synonymous with Tibet and its quest for genuine autonomy under Beijing's tightening grip on the Himalayan region.\n\nFrom his adopted hometown of Dharamshala, where he established a government-in-exile, the spiritual leader has unified Tibetans at home and in exile and elevated their plight onto the global stage.\n\nThat has made the Dalai Lama a persistent thorn in the side of Beijing, which denounces him as a dangerous \"separatist\" and a \"wolf in monk's robes\".\n\nSince the 1970s, the Dalai Lama has maintained that he no longer seeks full independence for Tibet, but \"meaningful\" autonomy that would allow Tibetans to preserve their distinct culture, religion and identity. His commitment to the nonviolent \"middle way\" approach has earned him international support and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nBuddhist monks of various schools of Tibetan Buddhism watch a recorded video message by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in Dharamshala, India, Wednesday, July 2, 2025, ahead of his birthday according to the Gregorian calendar on July 6. (AP Photo/Ashwini Bhatia)\n\nThe Dalai Lama has long been wary of Beijing's attempt to meddle with the reincarnation system of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nTibetan Buddhists believe in the circle of rebirth, and that when an enlightened spiritual master like the Dalai Lama dies, he will be able to choose the place and time of his rebirth through the force of compassion and prayer.\n\nBut the religious tradition has increasingly become a battleground for the control of Tibetan hearts and minds, especially since the contested reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in the religion.\n\nIn 1995, years after the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, Beijing installed its own panchen lama in defiance of the Dalai Lama, whose pick for the role \u2013 a six-year-old boy \u2013 has since vanished from public view.\n\nUnder Tibetan tradition, the dalai lamas and the panchen lamas have long played key roles in recognising each other's reincarnations. Experts believe Beijing will seek to interfere in the current Dalai Lama's succession in a similar way.\n\n\"There's a whole series of high-level reincarnated lamas cultivated by the Chinese government to work with it inside Tibet. (Beijing) will call on all of those to help establish the Dalai Lama that they pick inside Tibet,\" Gamble said.\n\n\"There's been a long-term plan to work toward this.\"\n\nA \"resolution of gratitude\" statement released by Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders gathering in Dharamshala on Wednesday said they \"strongly condemn the People's Republic of China's usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain\" and \"will never accept it\".\n\nFor his part, the current Dalai Lama has made clear that any candidate appointed by Beijing will hold no legitimacy in the eyes of Tibetans or followers of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\"It is totally inappropriate for Chinese Communists, who explicitly reject religion, including the idea of past and future lives, to meddle in the system of reincarnation of lamas, let alone that of the Dalai Lama,\" he writes in his latest memoir, Voice for the Voiceless .",

There was a time when it wasn't a matter of whether Shibasaki could play this kind of football or earn this honour, but when it would come.\n\nLoading...\n\nShibasaki caught the eye as a junior, not just because of his background \u2014 though there are not many potential NRL players who are the great-great grandsons of Japanese pearl divers \u2014 but also his pedigree.\n\nAs a youth, Shibasaki stamped himself a prospect of uncommon talent. He made his first Queensland side when he was just 12 and represented the state's under-20s side three years in a row.\n\nIn a Broncos under-20 team that contained Payne Haas, Pat Carrigan, Lindsay Collins, Jaydn Su'A, Herbie Farnworth, Tom Flegler, Kotoni Staggs and Jamayne Isaako, it wasn't easy to stand out, but Shibasaki managed it.\n\nShibasaki came through the ranks with a host of future stars at the Broncos. (AAP: Dan Himbrechts)\n\nHe made his NRL debut in 2018, the same year as Haas and Staggs, and NRL stardom seemed within his grasp, only to depart at the end of the following season.\n\n\"He's always been gifted,\" Haas said.\n\n\"He was one of the best players growing up when we were kids.\n\n\"He lost his way a bit the last few years. But he's found his way back, and I'm super proud of him, I just hate that he's a Queenslander.\"\n\nIt's been a long way back to Brisbane, back to the spotlight, back to where Shibasaki's talent once seemed certain to carry him. He has freely admitted that during the lost years, there were times he took rugby league for granted, a lesson learned the hard way through his many travels.\n\nThe first stop was Newcastle, where, after a strong start, the COVID shutdown halted Shibasaki's progress and, by his own admission, he lost focus.\n\nHe spent much of his two years there in reserve grade, where he rubbed shoulders with a young and hungry outside back named Jacob Kiraz.\n\nToday, Kiraz is one of the best wingers in the NRL and will act as 18th man for New South Wales for Game III, but back then, he was a 19-year-old scrapper fighting for a chance alongside Shibasaki in front of minuscule crowds on forgotten footy fields all around the place.\n\nShibasaki spent two seasons with the Knights for mixed results. (AAP: Darren Pateman)\n\n\"I was still really young. Whenever I asked him questions regarding footy, he'd always have answers, and when I moved to Newy, he welcomed me with open arms,\" Kiraz said.\n\n\"Stuff happens for a reason, it happened to me, and at the time it can be hard and you don't understand why.\n\n\"But you see him now and he's making his Origin debut, which is pretty crazy, but I'm sure he wouldn't want to change his path to any other way because it wouldn't have got him to where it is.\n\n\" Sometimes the easy path isn't the right path. You don't forget those tough moments. \"\n\nTwo seasons with the Knights yielded just 14 NRL games and Shibasaki left for Japanese rugby, signing a deal with Tokatsu Green Rockets.\n\nIt wasn't just a different sport, but a different world. Amid clashes with teams like Toshiba Brave Lupus, Tokyo Sungoliath and Saitama Wild Knights, the language and cultural barrier meant a trip down the shops could become an adventure and Google Translate was a constant companion.\n\nThe team was located about an hour from glittering sprawl of Tokyo, so players rode their bikes along roads lined with rice paddy fields to get to training and with the omicron COVID variant making it difficult for friends and family to travel to Japan, the foreign imports stuck close together.\n\nShibasaki in action for the NEC Green Rockets in 2022. (Getty Images: Atsushi Tomura)\n\n\"He was a lot of fun to be around. The Japanese boys loved him, given he had that Japanese heritage,\" said Ben Hughes, a teammate at Tokatsu.\n\n\"Rugby is a completely different game to league, there's so much to learn and what I remember most about 'Shiba' was how he always wanted to improve, always asked questions, always wanted to learn \u2014 that might be off the senior players or the coaches.\n\n\"Back then they had a rule where only four non-Japanese players could be on the field at once, which wasn't easy.\n\n\"He would have played inside and outside blokes who didn't speak English, so you can't have those micro-conversations on the field and that makes the transition from league even more difficult.\n\n\" But he did well, his natural ability, his strength and skill, that came through \u2014 he's an athletic individual and we definitely saw that through the season. \"\n\nIt wasn't an easy year for the Green Rockets. Despite boasting Michael Cheika as director of rugby, it was a tough campaign and they narrowly avoided relegation after winning a late-season playoff against Mie Honda Heat.\n\nBut Shibasaki acquitted himself well, scoring three tries in eight games as he tried to make a fist of his new sport.\n\n\"I think Shiba would tell you he wasn't in the greatest nick when he arrived due to two weeks COVID isolation in a hotel room. But you could see his application, how he tried to learn \u2014 he wasn't there to muck around,\" Hughes said.\n\n\"You can see why he's done well because the mindset he had, playing a new sport in a foreign country and the way he went about it at training, it shows why he's made the State of Origin side now.\"\n\nShibasaki returned to Australia once the Japanese season wrapped up to sign with the Mackay Cutters in the Queensland Cup.\n\nFrom there he went home to Townsville, signing first with the Cowboys, where hamstring injuries kept him to just two matches, and then with their feeder club the Townsville Blackhawks.\n\nFor a time, Shibasaki was happy working a normal job and playing Queensland Cup. He was back home and free from the pressures of life in elite sport and after the wandering years, that was enough.\n\nA one-match cameo on loan with South Sydney last year could well have been the end of him at the top level, with just the trainspotters and the tragics left to remember.\n\nBut a chance meeting with Carrigan when the Broncos were in town to play the Cowboys lit a fire in Shibasaki. The boys he came through with at Brisbane had become men and were riding high and he wanted to be a part of it.\n\nInjuries slowed Shibasaki down on his return to Townsville. (AAP: Scott Radford)\n\nHe signed with Wynnum-Manly and part of the deal included a train and trial contract with the Broncos and it got off to a rough start \u2014 on his first day, Shibasaki couldn't finish the session.\n\nBut he stayed on the job, winning the respect of coach Michael Maguire through his work ethic and persistence and slowly uncovered the ability that had always lurked within.\n\nHaas could see the change in his old teammate from the start.\n\n\"He's way more dialled in, he took his training more seriously, the way was eating, the way he was preparing for training, it was cool to see,\" Haas said.\n\n\"I knew he was serious about. I knew he knew this was his last shot. He took it with both hands and he's never looked back.\"\n\nAfter a summer of hard work, Shibasaki was a surprise starter for round one and at the end of years in the wilderness, he became the player he promised to be.\n\nShibasaki has become a key contributor for Brisbane this season. (AAP: Dave Hunt )\n\nShibasaki plays strong and brave and competes on everything. He has finished off plenty an attacking movement and sits second in the league for tries scored and first among centres, doubling his career try tally in less than half a year.\n\nHe is also second among centres in line breaks, fourth in tackle busts and fifth in metres gained.\n\nThe prodigy of another time, who has travelled far and seen so much, has returned older and wiser and has moved the past into overtaking the future.\n\nSelwyn Cobbo and Deine Mariner are two of the most talented outside backs in the sport and Shibasaki is keeping them out of Broncos best 17 every week, rightfully so.\n\nThis season is the first time he has played more than 12 games in an NRL season and despite making his first grade debut back in 2018, only Robert Toia carries fewer top flight appearances into the decider.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nStephen Crichton, the man he will mark and by most's reckoning the best centre in the game, made his first grade debut a year after Shibasaki and has almost three times as many games to his name.\n\nHis selection is one of the most unheralded Origin calls in years, just as Toia's was for Game One, because this is a career that never quite got started like it was supposed to.\n\nBut if it was about how you start, Shibasaki wouldn't be here at all.\n\nHe wouldn't have made it to the end of the journey which has doubled as a new beginning, with his name on the back of a Queensland jersey, the eyes of the rugby league world on him and a chance to enter the Maroons pantheon of unlikely heroes who answered the call when their time came and their state needed them.\n\nTo get it done, he'll have to defy the odds, with New South Wales entering the game as warm favourites.\n\nBut when you've fought your way back from the brink like he has, when you've come home to yourself and finally achieved the promise of your youth that by all rights should have slipped away, anything must feel possible.\n\nABC Sport will be live blogging all the action from the Origin III decider on Wednesday, July 9 at abc.net.au/sport.",

    "text": "A central Queensland city has become the first in Australia to have its entire gas network blended with green hydrogen amid greenwashing accusations against the company behind the project.\n\nThe Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG) unveiled its Hydrogen Park Gladstone facility on Wednesday, a site which blends up to 10 per cent hydrogen with natural gas.\n\nIt means the company's entire Gladstone network of about 700 customers are being supplied with the lower-emissions product.\n\n\"This is a demonstration facility, so the purpose of this is to show [the technology] and for us to learn that it is technically possible to blend into a whole-of-city network,\" said acting chief executive Cathryn McArthur.\n\nThe project began operating about six months ago and AGIG said it had produced more than 1 tonne of green hydrogen so far.\n\nState Callide MP Bryson Head and Cathryn McArthur cooking snags on a hydrogen blended gas barbecue in Gladstone. (ABC News: Jasmine Hines)\n\nGreen hydrogen is produced onsite using an electrolyser which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nThat hydrogen is then mixed with gas and distributed into its entire network in Gladstone, which supplies gas to commercial and residential customers.\n\nMs McArthur said customers had been using the product at no additional cost.\n\nThe Australian Gas Infrastructure Group's Hydrogen Park Gladstone facility. (ABC News: Jasmine Hines)\n\nThe total cost of the project was $6.48 million, which included a $2.73 million contribution from the Queensland government.\n\nAGIG has been supplying the blended gas from its South Australian facility, but the company said Gladstone was the first city where its entire network was using the product.\n\nGreenwashing accusations\n\nThe launch of the Gladstone site comes less than a week after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched action in the Federal Court relating to the Australian Gas Network's advertising, which claimed its gas would be renewable within a generation.\n\nAGIG is the Australian Gas Network's parent company.\n\nThe electrolyser on site which splits hydrogen from water. (ABC News: Jasmine Hines)\n\nThe ACCC action argued technical and economic obstacles meant the company could not make that claim and alleged it was greenwashing.\n\nMs McArthur said the company would defend the accusations.\n\n\"This [Gladstone] project is a real-world demonstration of the potential of renewable gas.

(Supplied: Prada)\n\nAll pointed out that they suspiciously resembled the Kolhapuri chappal \u2014 a handcrafted Indian sandal native to Kolhapur, a city in the west Indian state of Maharashtra.\n\nCan a design 'belong' to anyone?\n\nIn 2019, India's government officially recognised Kolhapuri chappals as being first made in the city of Kolhapur.\n\n\"This tag formally recognises their unique cultural heritage and links them to a specific region,\" said Arshiya Kapoor, associate professor in fashion design and marketing at India's MIT Institute of Design.\n\n\" It reinforces that this design belongs to the local artisan communities who have preserved the craft for generations. \"\n\nArishya Kapoor says Prada's sandal design and construction looks entirely lifted from Kolhapuri chappals. (Supplied: Arishya Kapoor)\n\nDr Kapoor said Prada's sandal design was \"a clear case of cultural appropriation\".\n\n\"The design elements, construction, and overall aesthetic have been lifted almost entirely from this footwear style and directly applied to Prada's new sandal,\" she told the ABC.\n\n\"They are a luxury brand profiting from a traditional Indian craft without acknowledgement, credit, or collaboration with the communities who originated it.\"\n\nMany local artisans in India rely on their designs for their livelihood. (Reuters: Manoj Kumar)\n\nPrada's sandals are reportedly priced at $1,200 a pair.\n\nBy contrast, the authentic Kolhapuri sandals can be found in Indian markets for as little as $10.\n\nDr Kapoor said the deeper issue lies in taking away economic opportunities and recognition from artisans who have perfected and preserved their craft over generations.\n\n\"These skilled makers rely on their designs for their livelihood,\" she said.\n\n\"When global brands replicate their work without offering monetary compensation or partnerships, it undermines their sustainability and growth.\"\n\nPrada responds to controversy\n\nThe online furore extended to artisans and even politicians in India.\n\nA member of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Dhananjay Mahadik, led a delegation of artisans who craft this traditional footwear.\n\nMr Mahadik said he presented a letter to the Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, urging the state to act against what they deemed was cultural and commercial appropriation.\n\n\"We want Prada to give the Kolhapuri identity to their product, and local artisans should get the revenue,\" he told Indian media.\n\nMany argue Indian artisans could manufacture sandals for Prada to reach more consumers. (Reuters)\n\n\" If Prada gives us orders, we can manufacture for them. The Kolhapuri brand will reach globally. \"\n\nThe Maharashtra chamber of commerce wrote to Prada chairperson Patrizio Bertelli about the concerns of sandal makers.\n\nTwo days later, the Italian fashion juggernaut responded.\n\nIt acknowledged that the sandals' design was inspired by the centuries-old Indian sandals.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"We deeply recognise the cultural significance of such Indian craftsmanship,\" Prada said in a statement.\n\n\"Please note that, for now, the entire collection is currently at an early stage of design development, and none of the pieces are confirmed to be produced or commercialised.\"\n\nPrada said it remained \"committed to responsible design practices, fostering cultural engagement, and opening a dialogue for a meaningful exchange with local Indian artisan communities\".\n\nPunar is a start-up that sells handmade, ethical fashion textiles in India.\n\nIts founder, Priya Ravindra, told the ABC that Prada's sandals were an example of \"exploiting South Asian heritage for profit while sidelining its creators\".\n\n\"With ample resources, luxury brands like Prada have no excuse for delayed acknowledgement,\" she said.\n\n\" It must happen up-front, not following global social media outrage. \"\n\nPriya Ravindra works closely with artisans across India for her ethical textiles business. (Supplied: Priya Ravindra)\n\nSince launching her business, Ms Ravindra has upskilled and created jobs for more than a dozen female artisans in India.\n\nShe advocates for mandatory cultural origin labelling and direct partnerships with artisans.\n\n\"We know that EU regulations mandate strict origin labelling for European products, yet no global framework protects South Asian crafts,\" she said.\n\nIs acknowledgement enough?\n\nPrada's response was \"surface level\", according to Dr Kapoor.\n\n\"It does nothing to benefit the artisan or the community whose craft is being used,\" she said.\n\nIs it ever OK to wear a bindi or headdress? Photo shows Collage of Chanel boomerang, red turban, bindis and Native American headdress to depict cultural appropriation in fashion. When is it problematic to adopt customs, practices or ideas from a group of people or culture? And what's the line between inspiration and evolution, and cultural appropriation?\n\n\"Kolhapuri Chappals are made by artisan communities, often from marginalised backgrounds, who rely on this work for their livelihood.\"\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by the Indian Ministry of Textiles, India has over 7 million artisans, with a significant portion involved in traditional footwear production.\n\nBut Dr Kapoor said many struggle with low incomes, lack of market access and declining recognition in \"an increasingly commercialised design world\".\n\n\"If the brand truly values the heritage it draws from, it must go beyond imitation,\" she said.\n\n\"It should collaborate directly with the artisans, offer them opportunities for production and ensure fair economic benefit.\"",

(Supplied)\n\n\" The issue is where vulnerable road users and cars are mixing. \"\n\nGeraldton, Bunbury and Subiaco have already implemented lower speed limits.\n\nSubiaco Mayor David McMullen said the benefits of the decision were clear.\n\n\"Speed limits on Rokeby Road were reduced to 30kph in 2021, which has resulted in an almost 50 per cent reduction in reported accidents,\" he said.\n\nThe City of Subiaco is also one of five inner-city councils that plan to expand 40kph residential areas, along with the cities of Perth, South Perth, Vincent and Victoria Park.\n\nTogether, they form the Perth Inner City Group.\n\n\"Following a review of community feedback, and a technical review of the proposed area-wide speed zones, the Perth Inner City Group will submit the 40kph proposal to Main Roads WA and the Road Safety Commission for consideration,\" Mr McMullen said.\n\n\"In the City of Subiaco, only local residential streets would have the reduction in speed limits.\n\n\"This means minimal to no appreciable impact on transit times in many cases because it's not long before drivers get back onto bigger distributor roads.\"\n\nPedestrian survival\n\nAssociate Professor Roberts said a pedestrian only had a 10 per cent chance of survival if they were struck at 60kph.\n\n\"If we take it down to 30 kilometres an hour, which is the gold standard for pedestrian areas around the world, the survival rate, instead of being 10 per cent, is 90 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\" Forty [kph] is way better than 60 [kph], but not as good as 30 [kph]. \"\n\nPaul Roberts says the change to 30kph should happen in metropolitan and regional areas. (ABC Great Southern: Rosemary Murphy)\n\nLocal governments in regional areas such as Albany are also taking action on urban speed.\n\nEarlier this year, the City of Albany expanded 40kph zones to encompass areas with high pedestrian activity, including two children's crossings on Lockyer Avenue and Middleton Road.\n\nGreat Southern Traffic Unit officer in charge Derek Grimes said it was a good move for safety.\n\nAreas in a 40 kph zone were expanded in Albany earlier this year. (ABC Great Southern: Peter Barr)\n\n\"When you look down York Street, it's pretty hard to do more than 40kph when it's busy anyway, just with traffic congestion,\" Senior Sergeant Grimes said.\n\n\"But on the surrounding roads, for example Aberdeen Street and some of the other ones, there has been a remarkable decrease in speed, which is good.\n\n\"Getting hit by a car even at 40 can cause serious injury, let alone 50, so it's certainly a move in the right direction for safety.\"\n\nDerek Grimes says the speed reductions have been good for safety. (ABC News: Kyle Pauletto)\n\nRoad Safety Minister Reece Whitby said lowering urban speed limits was a discussion for local governments and communities.\n\n\"I welcome that discussion, and if we can have common-sense approaches that increase community safety it's a good thing,\" he said.\n\n\"We know there are 40kph limits outside schools during drop-off and pick-up times, and that makes sense, that's common sense.\n\n\"I think there could be other parts of suburbs and towns where it makes sense to have that lower speed limit.\"",

It happened sooner than I thought.\n\nIt's progressed quickly. At first it was little things we noticed, then she had her licence was taken away.\n\nAnd then she basically was becoming a lot more reliant on myself and my brother and her partner.\n\nI'd have to go over and clean out her fridge and order her groceries.\n\nI'd make appointments, take her to them, keep track of all that.\n\nIt was like the mental load of almost another child.\n\nBec says most days she's exhausted.

(Supplied: Ron Bonham)\n\nShe also said two-thirds of rock-climbing routes at Mount Arapiles were shut for \"disputed\" cultural heritage reasons \"at the behest of the local Indigenous corporation\" after sacred Indigenous rock art was rediscovered.\n\nDr Webster told the crowd some of the rock art \"can't even be seen with the naked eye anymore\".\n\nTaylors Rock at Mount Arapiles was closed to rock climbing after Indigenous rock art was found. (Supplied: Parks Victoria)\n\n'Disgraceful' language\n\nThree mayors at the event told the ABC the rhetoric of the speech, which Dr Webster gave in front of several Indigenous mayors, councillors and chief executives, was \"tone deaf\", \"appalling\", \"truly disgraceful\", \"really offensive\" and \"hugely inappropriate\".\n\nBerrigan Shire Mayor Julia Cornwell McKean, a Wiradjuri woman, said it was not the time for Dr Webster to claim native title was restricting councils from doing their job.\n\nJulia Cornwell McKean says she was stunned by the speech. (Supplied: Julia Cornwell McKean)\n\n\"It was just truly disgraceful for someone who has been a shadow minister for two seconds,\" Cr Cornwell McKean said.\n\n\"Quite frankly, I was stunned.\n\n\"I was just sitting there in disbelief that someone would use this valuable platform at this critical point in their career as a shadow minister to make points of this nature.\n\n\"It wasn't a topic for the National General Assembly, and a whole number of Indigenous people and people in the audience decided to leave the assembly at that time.\"\n\nByron Shire Mayor Sarah Ndiaye was among those who walked out.\n\nSarah Ndiaye says she found the speech offensive. (Supplied: Sarah Ndiaye)\n\nShe said when Dr Webster started to question how land where no artefacts were found was culturally significant, the speech moved into \"really offensive territory\" and identity politics.\n\n\"As if that's the only measure of cultural significance,\" Cr Ndiaye said.\n\n\"Anyone who knows anything about native title and cultural significance knows that's not the case at all.\n\n\" It was just hugely inappropriate, and I felt incredibly embarrassed and ashamed that someone would do that in that context. \"\n\nMildura Mayor Helen Healy, whose council is in Ms Webster's electorate, said the role of local government leaders was to bring people together, not divide them.\n\nHelen Healy says Ms Webster's speech caused concern. (ABC News: Peter Sanders)\n\n\"It deeply troubles me that one of our most vulnerable communities is being used, and I'll refer to the words of the mayor of Palm Island speaking to delegates after the incident, as a 'political football to kick around',\" Cr Healy said.\n\n\"Furthermore, with Indigenous Australian culture being a major driver of international tourism, what is it going to mean to the economies of our communities when a federal leader dismisses the cultural significance of Mallee places like Lake Tyrrell at Sea Lake?\"\n\nThe significance of culture\n\nWotjobaluk Wergaia Jaardwa Jardwadjali man Gary Murray said Lake Tyrrell, known as Direl, was a well-documented culturally significant place featuring burial sites and discovered objects that confirmed First Nations people, their ancestors and clans belonged to this country for millennia.\n\n\"Our unique cultural heritage is shared with all Australians, and this significant cultural heritage should never disappear from our country at the whim of a development or the need for a pollie's vote,\" Mr Murray said.\n\n\"After all, there is no other Direl place in the world with such documented significant cultural heritage linked to the astronomy, people, waters and landscape.\"\n\nVictoria's Lake Tyrrell under the Milky Way. (Supplied: @robemburyphoto)\n\nArchaeologist and Njeri Njeri and Wergaia man Mark Grist said Lake Tyrrell and its surrounds was a sensitive landscape and a special place with a rare sky story.\n\n\"It has a lot of archaeology history to it, and it also has a lot of oral history and it has the sky story, which is significant to the wider area of Lake Tyrrell,\" Mr Grist said.\n\n\"Whatever does happen at Lake Tyrrell has got to be done in a way that respects Lake Tyrrell, as a landscape and the people that use it as well, including my people, and we used it all the time.\"\n\nStatements 'consistent'\n\nDr Webster told news.com.au a conversation about cultural heritage bans was worth having, and those who chose to walk out during her speech were known to cause \"difficulty\" to other councillors.\n\nShe told the ABC the comments she made on cultural heritage were consistent with statements she had publicly made before.\n\n\"I have been grateful for the significant number of ALGA delegates who have subsequently contacted me from all over Australia, wholeheartedly supporting my comments,\" Dr Webster said.\n\nDr Webster gave the opening address at the ALGA national general assembly. (Supplied: Anne Webster)\n\nThe shadow minister for Indigenous Australians and social services, Kerrynne Liddle, said Dr Webster's speech was about the impact the Native Title Act 1993 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 had on constituents and stakeholders.\n\n\"The issues raised by Dr Webster are not new and are often raised by traditional owners, constituents and developers in relation to the native title and cultural heritage acts across Australia,\" Senator Liddle said.",

England defeats India in the first Test of their five-match series, with Ben Duckett's century leading the team to the 10th-highest successful run chase in history.\n\nAfter Ben Stokes won the toss and put India in to bat, opener Yashasvi Jaiswal looked well set for a big score, but fell in the second session to the England skipper when he was on 87 to miss out on his second ton in the series.\n\nIndia has never won a Test at Edgbaston in eight attempts. And when it was reeling at 5-211, England threatened to reopen wounds from the first Test at Headingley, where the tourists' lower order collapsed in both innings.\n\nBut Jadeja walked in to steady the ship and consolidated the innings with a 99-run partnership with Gill as the all-rounder rotated strike without taking any undue risks, propelling his skipper towards triple figures.\n\nAs England eagerly waited for the new ball, Joe Root bowled the 80th over in a bid to surprise the set batters, but after four dot balls, Gill executed two fine sweeps to bring up a second century in the series.\n\nOn a track that was quite flat after lunch, England was ultimately left to rue a couple of lbw reviews that went against it by the narrowest of margins as the umpire's call saved India on two occasions.\n\n\"Umpiring decisions either go your way or they don't. Umpire's call is there for a reason,\" said Chris Woakes, who picked up two wickets on a \"tiring day\" for the bowlers.\n\n\"It's just frustrating because [if] those wickets go your way and it's 3-30, you are into the middle order with the ball hard and new.\"\n\nIndia made three changes, resting Bumrah to manage his back issues through the series \u2014 a decision that baffled former players and coaches.\n\nSai Sudharsan and Shardul Thakur were dropped, with Reddy, Washington Sundar and Akash Deep coming into the side to strengthen the lower order.\n\nIndia lost opener KL Rahul cheaply when he played on a rising delivery from Woakes while Karun Nair, who was promoted up the order, fell for 31, caught in the slips just before lunch after playing some exquisite drives.\n\nJaiswal saw off the new ball early on in cloudy conditions but once the lush green outfield was bathed in sunshine, he got into his groove and scored at nearly a run a ball.\n\nGill took the majority of the strike in the second session while Jaiswal watched on and that was when Stokes made the breakthrough.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nHaving scored a century in the opening Test, Jaiswal was on 87 when he sliced at a wide delivery and was caught behind by an ecstatic Jamie Smith to leave India on 161-3.\n\nThat brought Rishabh Pant to the crease and the wicketkeeper-batter, who smashed two centuries in the first Test, launched spinner Shoaib Bashir over the deep mid-wicket boundary for the first six of the match.\n\nBut Bashir had the last laugh as Pant (25) lived dangerously and the batter made another attempt to clear the ropes, only to find Zak Crawley in the deep, opening the door to the lower order.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy came in and lasted six balls when Woakes struck again, tempting the India batter to leave a superb delivery that nipped back in and hit the top of the stump to send the bails flying, bringing Jadeja in.\n\nReuters",

(Supplied: Holly Godfrey)\n\nPatchy germination has made things worse, particularly for her canola.\n\n\"I just looked at some photos of canola this time last year and it was far more advanced than it is this year.\"\n\nDespite the dry start and grim outlook, Ms Godfrey remains hopeful.\n\n\"We're in a pretty reliable area here in Cunderdin, so I think the rain will come eventually,\" she said.\n\nLast month, four cold fronts swept over the south west of WA, bringing bursts of cold and wet weather to large parts.\n\nCunderdin is still crying out for rain. (Supplied: Holly Godfrey)\n\nThe South West district received the bulk of it, with some towns recording higher than average rainfall totals for June.\n\nWitchcliffe West topped the charts with 277.8mm, followed by Jarrahwood which picked up more than 200mm and Bunbury at 190mm.\n\nThe heavy rain extended up the west coast, with Geraldton Airport collecting a decent 135mm.\n\nPerth also got a good dose of rainfall across June, but due to the metro rain gauge suffering technical difficulties, the closest estimate to the city's monthly total would be Perth Airport's 153.8mm.\n\nSome missing out\n\nBut due to those cold fronts weakening quickly and a lack of support from north-west cloud bands, areas further inland that were desperate for a drink missed out.\n\nAcross the Wheatbelt and Great Southern, most places only received about 50 to 60 per cent of their normal June rainfall.\n\nCunderdin Airport received 26.8mm while York picked up just over 21mm.\n\nMs Godfrey said that was not nearly enough to set crops up for a successful season.\n\nYork has experienced below-average rainfall in recent months. (ABC News: Aran Hart)\n\n\"There's a bit of moisture in the ground now which is helping but it just means that the crops are pretty late this year, and the season will probably be a shorter growing season unfortunately,\" she said.\n\n\"I think we would have hoped to have had a good 100mm by now, but another 50 to 100mm in the next month would be great.\"\n\nBut not all farmers were in the same boat.\n\nAt Tenterden, 328 kilometres south-east of Perth, Michael Webster's seeding program was progressing well due to early rains and good soil moisture.\n\n\"We've had a great start to our season so far,\" he said.\n\nMichael Webster says it has been a great start to the season. (ABC News: Mark Bennett)\n\n\"We have had 234mm since January with 64mm over June \u2014 so it's still got a way to go, but very, very grateful for what we've had so far.\"\n\nMr Webster said this season was already tracking better than last.\n\n\"The canola is particularly good, growth rates have been pretty phenomenal,\" he said.\n\nPerth wakes to eerie fog Photo shows Fog seen blanketing a city at sunrise photographed from a drone. Perth residents awoke to a rare, mystical treat on Thursday morning, with heavy fog blanketing much of WA\u2019s west coast.\n\nBut he knows other farmers haven't been as fortunate.\n\n\"You don't have to drive too far for guys who have missed out on a lot of the April, May or June rain,\" Mr Webster said.\n\n\"We're in a little bit of a bubble here but it's definitely a different story for a lot of people.\"\n\n'Desperate need'\n\nYork-based agronomist Michael Lamond agreed the season had started well for southern WA, but said crucial follow-up rain had instead been falling further north.\n\n\"It's only been just enough to keep things ticking over and so we're sort of in quite a desperate need of rain now,\" he said.\n\n\"It's also been a very cold winter so far, so the crops have sort of really hit the brakes and they've slowed down, and they're sort of saying look we need a drink.\"\n\nWA's grain growers delivered their third-largest harvest on record last year, following record-breaking seasons in 2021 and 2022.\n\nMichael Lamond says some farmers are in \"desperate need\" of rain. (ABC Rural: Jo Prendergast)\n\nMr Lamond, who authors the Grain Industry Association of WA's crop report, said for most farmers this season was shaping out to mirror 2023, a colder season that produced only 14.5 million tonnes.\n\n\"There was that optimism at the start, and now everyone's wondering how things are going to go from now on,\" he said.\n\n\"If we don't get rain soon, like essentially next week or the week after, we'll run out of time for the crops to finish in the spring when the heat comes so I'd say it's becoming quite desperate.\"\n\nPrayers may not be answered\n\nWhile a cold front overnight and another on Sunday are expected to deliver some light falls to agricultural areas, the Bureau of Meteorology's forecast shows it won't be answering any prayers.\n\n\"The fronts are more likely to bring around 10-20mm instead of those upper end type rainfall figures,\" senior meteorologist Joey Rawson said.\n\nDr Joey Rawson is a senior meteorologist with the Bureau of Meteorology. (ABC News: Tabarak Al Jrood)\n\nThe bureau's July outlook suggests farmers may have to wait a little longer.\n\n\"We can expect less rainfall and warmer conditions than normal,\" Dr Rawson said.\n\n\"But hopefully when we get to August, things will turn around, and we'll start seeing wetter conditions, and also more normal temperatures.\"",

    "text": "Carlos Alcaraz, Aryna Sabalenka and the end of London's heatwave have seen a sense of normality return to the lawns of Wimbledon after two sweat-soaked days of shocks.\n\nA stream of big names including Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev crashed and burned in the oven-like temperatures of the first round.\n\nSo when Alcaraz walked on Centre Court on Wednesday to continue his quest for a third successive title against British qualifier Oliver Tarvet, the thought surely lurked somewhere in his mind that he could be the fall guy in the tournament's greatest upset.\n\nThe 22-year-old second seed was not at his best but, after saving three break points in a nervy opening service game against a college student ranked 733rd in the world, he asserted his authority to win 6-1, 6-,4, 6-4.\n\nAlcaraz, bidding to do the French Open-Wimbledon double for the second successive year, needed five sets to get past Italian veteran Fabio Fognini in the first round and set up an intriguing clash with 21-year-old Tarvet.\n\nTarvet, who plays on the US collegiate circuit for the University of San Diego, said he believed he could beat anyone, even Alcaraz, after winning his grand slam debut match against fellow qualifier Leandro Riedi of Switzerland on Monday.\n\nHe was clearly not overawed at sharing a court with a five-time grand slam champion and, had he taken any of the eight break points he earned in the first set, it could have been closer.\n\nAlcaraz proved a step too far though as he moved through the gears when required to keep an eager Tarvet under control.\n\n\"First of all, I have to give a big congratulations to Oliver,\" Alcaraz said.\n\n\"It's his second match on the tour. I just loved his game, to be honest, the level he played.\"\n\nEarlier on Centre Court, women's top seed Sabalenka battled to a 7-6(4), 6-4 win against Czech Marie Bouzkov\u00e1.\n\n\"Honestly, it is sad to see so many upsets in the tournament, in both draws, women's and men's,\" Sabalenka, who is seeking her first Wimbledon title, said.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm just trying to focus on myself.\"\n\nAustralian Open champion Madison Keys, the sixth seed, also made it safely into round three, beating Olga Danilovi\u0107 6-4, 6-2, while unseeded four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka eased past Czech doubles specialist Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1 6-3, 6-2.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nLower temperatures did not mean an end to the surprises entirely though. American world number 12 Frances Tiafoe became the 14th of the 32 men's seeds to depart, going down 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 to Cameron Norrie, one of seven British players in second-round singles action on day three.\n\nWomen's fourth seed Jasmine Paolini was upset by world number 62 Kamilla Rakhimova 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nSonay Kartal led the home charge by beating Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova 6-2, 6-2 to book her place in the last 32 for the second year in succession.\n\nThere was disappointment, though, for Britain's Katie Boulter, who served 14 double faults as she went down 6-7(9), 6-2, 6-1 to 101st-ranked Solana Sierra, the Argentine who lost in qualifying but seized her lucky loser spot with both hands.\n\nRaducanu clinical in bringing down Wimbledon champ\n\nEmma Raducanu played some of her most clinical tennis since her US Open title run to sweep aside 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-3, 6-3 and reach the third round.\n\nIn front of a raucous crowd, Raducanu surprised even herself sometimes in outduelling the Czech player in a match between grand slam winners who were both unseeded.\n\n\"That was one of the best matches I've played in a long time,\" said Raducanu, the 2021 champion at Flushing Meadows.\n\n\"I turned one point around that I think is probably the best point I've ever played, so that was pretty crazy. I think the crowd were loving it.\"\n\nShe may have to up her level even further in the next match, though. In a tournament where four of the five top women's seeds have already been eliminated, the British home favourite will be up against the only one remaining \u2014 Aryna Sabalenka.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess there's no pressure at all on me the next round,\" Raducanu said in an on-court interview, laughing.\n\nThere's always pressure on Raducanu playing at Wimbledon, especially after she became the first British woman since 1977 to capture a grand slam title when she won the US Open as a qualifier.\n\nShe struggled with injuries and form after that, and her fourth-round showing at Wimbledon last year is her best result in a major since.\n\nBut her win against Vondrousova, who in 2019 was the French Open runner-up, showed Raducanu might be back to her best.\n\n\"She was playing amazing tennis,\" Vondrousova said.\n\n\"She was crushing me in the rallies, so there wasn't much I could do.\"\n\nRaducanu seemed pretty impressed with her own performance as well.\n\n\"I think today I played really, really well,\" she said.\n\n\"I knew today I had to be aggressive because Marketa would beat me if I was going to push the ball around.\"\n\nReuters/AP",

    "text": "It began with a lunch, some red wine and a frosty fantasy and ended with a sacred vow \u2014 they would become Olympic curlers, or at the very least get matching jackets.\n\nThey're known as the Curlews, a group of curling dads from Brisbane, who only started the winter sport just over a year ago, but have made sweeping progress since first stepping on the ice.\n\n\"Stumbling across the sport is probably a perfect description \u2026 we were flat out Bambis on ice,\" Boyd Kildey said.\n\nKildey was the engineer of this icy ambition.\n\nThe Curlews describe themselves as being 'Bambis on ice' when they first had a crack at the sport. (ABC Sport: Mark Leonardi)\n\n\"A group of mates at lunch thinking about you know, what's the fun thing to do together, what's something interesting,\" he said.\n\n\"I brought up curling because it was an idea from years ago, and I tried it on with a few other groups of mates and unfortunately no-one had really jumped on board.\n\n\"But this group loved it and, fast-forward a week and half, and we were on the ice together trying out curling for the first time.\n\n\"They looked at us like we were an unusual bunch and said, 'Well, try this, try this and we just kept going and kept going.\"\n\nThe Curlews' first experience with the sport came during a 'come and try' session in Brisbane. (ABC Sport: Mark Leonardi)\n\nThe group of sports-mad dads had attended a come-and-try session at Boondall Ice Rink in Brisbane.\n\n\"I didn't know anything about curling, never watched it or anything like that,\" Cormac te Kloot said.\n\n\"I grew up in Western Queensland and so ice for me was non-existent, farming all my life ... so this is very different for me. All I knew, it required ice and brooms.\"\n\nThe four friends describe themselves as very different dads \u2014 a real estate agent, a sports commentator, a car dealership owner and a corporate farmer.\n\nA unique sport that fights for infrastructure, participation and relevance in Australia has brought the four dads closer together. (ABC Sport: Mark Leonardi)\n\n\"There is absolutely no link in the background other than we're mates, we've got kids who are roughly the same age, who have school sport together,\" Kildey said.\n\n\"Enthusiasm is our strength. We are very competitive, which is not always the best thing when the skills are not quite up there yet.\n\n\"It's a sport where you could play deep into your older age \u2026 curling is not the youngest sport in Australia.\n\n\"We actually sort of come in that sort of mid range and younger, so we're physically OK, we're doing alright ... we're going to try and use that to our advantage.\"\n\nFrance 2030?\n\nThe Curlews have not been just making up the numbers since taking up curling \u2014 a sport which fights for infrastructure, participation and relevance in a competitive sporting market in Australia.\n\nThe team has already won several competitions domestically and also travelled to New Zealand recently for the Australian National Curling Championships, which was held in Naseby.\n\nIt's why their belief of the ultimate dream has never wavered; it's only grown stronger.\n\n\"I don't think [going to the Olympics] is out of our realm,\" Andrew Swain said.\n\n\"We've learned really quickly in the past year if we can keep that steep learning curve improving then I reckon in four years' time again \u2026 all it takes is winning that national championships and then you go to an Olympic qualifier.\n\n\"Then, if you can finish in the top nations who haven't already qualified, you're in.\"\n\nWhat started as some fun between four dads over beers has become the kind of dream that clings to them like frost on the ice \u2014 unbelievable, uncomfortable but impossible to shake.\n\n\"I think that it's mateship, it's having a crack, it's having that attitude. If we can inspire other people in other different sports as well to have a crack at their dream,\" Swain said.\n\n\"We're in our 40s and I'm not going to lie: Age isn't on our side. But curling is a sport that you can do until you're very old, provided our knees all hold up.\"\n\nDoing it their way\n\nFor four self-described Australian larrikins who grew up chasing wickets on dry turf, they have now replaced bats with brooms and are navigating a sheet of ice.\n\nBut some things don't change.\n\n\"We have a lot of cricket terms to know where we put the rock,\" te Kloot said.\n\n\"We'll do an offee.\n\n\"So off we go and we spin it, spin it the appropriate way and our skip [Boyd] calls where he wants it and we try and do what he says and hopefully we land the rock where it's meant to go to get the points.\n\nHolding your balance and knowing when to slide is a key ingredient to success when it comes to curling. (ABC Sport: Mark Leonardi)\n\n\"Sliding is a really key part of curling \u2026 so if you can hold your balance and slide, then you let the rock go, and then let it do the rest of the work.\"\n\nIn Australia, there is no designated curling facility, with ice rinks like the one the Curlews use at Boondall, a multi-use facility, shared with ice-skating and ice hockey.\n\nSwain explained that the team had its first experience of specialist ice at the Nationals in Naseby.\n\n\"To use a cricket analogy, we've been playing backyard cricket on our driveways and now we've landed at Lords,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a completely different dynamic. The stones move the way that you want them to move, the sweeping actually has the desired effect that you want it to have.\"\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nKildey, who is the team's skipper, explained that their name, the Curlews, came from a very important source.\n\n\"We have a very good group of supportive wives behind us and it actually came from my wife,\" he said.\n\n\"She said, 'It's a loud obnoxious bird,' and it works perfectly for us.\n\n\"We are a bunch of crazy dads and we are dreaming big. We've gone, 'Let's do something together and work hard together and prove a lot of the naysayers wrong.'\"",

    "text": "Further complicating matters is that the administration has imposed the 10 per cent baseline tariff rate, foreshadowed the so-called reciprocal tariffs (there\u2019s nothing reciprocal about them) and has already imposed additional sectoral tariffs on steel and aluminium, products derived from those metals, autos and auto parts and foreshadowed more of those targeted tariffs. That makes the negotiations multidimensional and the overall outcome, once there is one, very messy. Each of America\u2019s major trading partners will have unique deals \u2013 a mix of an overall rate plus the sectoral tariffs \u2013 whether negotiated or imposed. US companies and consumers will pay the price for Trump\u2019s trade war. Credit: Bloomberg The agreement with Vietnam, and what\u2019s known about discussions with other major trading partners, provide some insights into what the US is trying to achieve, although details are sketchy \u2013 Trump announced the deal with Vietnam on his Truth Social platform. \u201cVietnam will pay the United States a 20 per cent tariff on any and all goods sent into our Territory, and a 40 per cent Tariff on any Transhipping. In return, Vietnam will do something they have never done before, give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade,\u201d Trump wrote (in his usual unique style).\n\n\u201cIn other words, they will \u2018OPEN THE MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,\u2019 meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff,\u201d he wrote. Trump thinks Vietnam, with per capita incomes of about $US4500, would be a good market for American SUVs, whose prices range from $US30,000 to about $US80,000! Loading Leaving aside the reality that it won\u2019t be the Vietnamese paying the import duties but the US importers, the rate on Vietnam\u2019s export to the US has just doubled. During Trump\u2019s trade war with China in his first term, a lot of companies that had used China as their manufacturing base shifted their factories to Vietnam. Others set up entities that finished semi-manufactured products from China to qualify as Vietnamese sourced products and there were those who simply re-labelled Chinese products as made in Vietnam. Since then, exports from Vietnam to the US have soared. Last year, for instance they jumped 33 per cent. Vietnam exported $US136.6 billion ($A207.5 billion) of goods to the US in 2024 but imported only $US13 billion.\n\nThe 40 per cent rate for \u201ctranshipping\u201d is squarely aimed at China, which is acutely aware that in most of the negotiations the US is trying to restrict efforts by Chinese companies to circumvent the 55 per cent tariff the US has imposed on its exports to the US and reduce its trade with third countries and access to global supply chains. Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation\u201d of America will come at a heavy cost. The deal with Vietnam will, if it can be policed (a major \u201cif\u201d for all these trade deals), hit China\u2019s exports of components and the rebadging of Chinese goods as \u201cMade in Vietnam.\u201d Similar demands are being made of the EU and other Asian and Latin American economies, some of which (including Germany) have significantly greater trade relationships with China than they do with the US. China has already warned that it won\u2019t accept US attempts to throttle its exports, with the Ministry of Commerce saying last weekend that \u201cof this happened, China will never accept it and will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d\n\nChina, of course, has a more powerful trade weapon than Trump\u2019s tariffs that it can deploy. It demonstrated in the trade confrontation with the US earlier this year, when there was an exchange of absurdly high tariffs that ended in an uneasy truce, that its dominance of rare earths can be weaponised. There\u2019s not much advanced manufacturing that can occur without access to rare earths and rare earth magnets \u2013 China could shut down the US auto industry almost overnight by cutting off supply and do substantial damage to America\u2019s defence capabilities. It could also use that leverage against countries co-operating with the US to shrink its exports. Trump\u2019s attempt to dictate lop-sided terms of trade with America\u2019s trade partners hasn\u2019t been as straightforward as he anticipated because they impinge on other countries sovereignty and are complicated by their domestic politics. Trump thinks Vietnam, with per capita incomes of about $US4500, would be a good market for American SUVs, whose prices range from $US30,000 to about $US80,000. Credit: Getty Negotiations with Japan have stalled because the US has imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Japan\u2019s auto exports and Trump has demanded Japan open its heavily protected market to American rice.\n\nJapan\u2019s auto industry generated about 10 per cent of its GDP and employs about 8 per cent of its workforce. While it exports about 1.4 million cars a year to the US, it makes a lot more \u2013 about 3.3 million a year \u2013 within the US. Japan\u2019s trade negotiators have made it clear that, while they are happy to commit to buying a lot more LNG and military equipment from US, the tariff on its auto exports is a dealbreaker. Rice is another non-negotiable, even though Japan is experiencing a shortage of the staple. The agricultural lobby within Japan is powerful and its support critical to the ruling Liberal Democrat Party, which faces an election later this month. That suggests its tariff will be set at 24 per cent \u2013 the rate announced on April 2 \u2013 although Trump has said that, if there is no deal, it could be 35 per cent \u201cor whatever the number is.\u201d Trump\u2019s 10 per cent baseline, sectoral and China tariffs have already raised the effective tariff rate on imports to the US from around 2.5 per cent into the mid-teens.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size On April 1, just before midnight, as a 2.1-metre king tide smashed the NSW coastline, real estate agent and father-to-be Steve Psomadelis got up for a drink of water. Underneath the floorboards of his low-set 1950s brick house at Dolls Point, on the southern reaches of Sydney\u2019s Botany Bay, he could hear the sound of gushing water. The tide had breached the seawall protecting the foreshore, inundating the waterfront promenade, main roadway and beachfront houses. At the Psomadelises\u2019 house, a block back from the beach, water was seeping into the laundry and lapping at the sunroom doors. In the driveway, the bonnet of his wife\u2019s car was underwater. \u201cI called out to my wife, \u2018We\u2019re flooding,\u2019 \u201d Psomadelis recalls. Minutes later, seawater was swirling above the top step. Just as Psomadelis and his pregnant wife Stephanie were attempting to climb out a side window, the SES arrived to evacuate them. \u201cWe grabbed the cat and got out of there,\u201d Psomadelis says. His street flooded to knee-height, along with the beachfront strip and two neighbouring streets. Water rose through the floorboards of their house, and sand was dumped across their front yard. They lost two fridges and a couch, and Stephanie\u2019s car was a write-off. Between rising sea levels and more frequent extreme-weather events, Australia\u2019s coastlines are being battered by the very visible effects of climate change. Has the dream of living by the beach become a nightmare? And what will Australia\u2019s coastlines look like in decades to come? \u201cThe April king tide was a once-in-50-year event, and it\u2019s happened twice in the last 10 years,\u201d says Psomadelis, who bought his house in 2022, seven years after Dolls Point last flooded in the April 2015 king tide. His neighbours \u2013 some who have lived there for decades \u2013 also blame infrastructure interventions on Botany Bay including two airport runways and a desalination plant, which they say have changed tidal patterns. \u201cIs it worth it? Yeah, for a place like this, it is,\u201d says Psomadelis. \u201cI can see the beach, and it\u2019s a beautiful area. We won\u2019t leave over something like this.\u201d The Psomadelises\u2019 house, a block back from Botany Bay, flooded in this year\u2019s king tide. Credit: Courtesy of Steve Psomadelises Only just the beginning The bad news for Australia\u2019s coast-loving communities is that rising sea levels are leading to more frequent and extreme events, resulting in severe coastal erosion and inundation of low-lying areas. The drivers behind coastal erosion are complex: tidal patterns, storm systems, ocean temperatures and broader climate cycles like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. But rising sea levels complicate the picture further. The recent east coast low, described by meteorologists as a \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d, and the first to hit the NSW coast since 2022, has brought the topic into sharp focus. It\u2019s likely to cause coastal erosion and damage to infrastructure between Seal Rocks and the NSW-Victorian border. UNSW coastal erosion expert Associate Professor Mitchell Harley says there\u2019s no evidence that east coast lows have become more frequent or severe in recent years. However, rising sea levels means their impact on the built coastline will be more profound. East coast lows are the subject of ongoing research, says Harley, as present climate models lack the resolution to truly capture their unpredictable behaviour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSea levels have been on an upward trajectory since records were first collected in the 1880s. But satellite monitoring over the past three decades shows a clear pattern: not only are sea levels rising, the rate is accelerating. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) sixth report, published in 2021, found a global mean sea level rise per year of 3.2 millimetres from 1993 to 2015, and 3.6 millimetres between 2006 and 2015. A 2024 NASA analysis of satellite data found a faster than expected rise last year alone, largely due to thermal expansion of seawater. Scientists had anticipated an increase of 4.3 millimetres but instead recorded 5.9 millimetres \u2013 a direct result of 2024 being the hottest year on record. Though these increments sound minuscule, the impact on coastal communities can be monumental. \u201cAs a general rule of thumb, for every 10 centimetres of sea level rise, you might see three times more extreme flooding events, depending on your location,\u201d says Dr Julian O\u2019Grady, a sea level scientist with the CSIRO. The IPCC\u2019s projections for sea level rise are sobering. They vary depending on location and whether we can meet Paris Agreement emissions targets. Even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the IPCC is predicting global sea level rises of 0.15-0.23 metres by 2050. By 2100, under very high emission scenarios, it could be 1 metre. Extreme sea level events that occurred once per century will be 20 to 30 times more frequent by 2050, the IPCC says. Along the NSW coast, state government data predicts rises of up to 2.3 metres by 2100 and 5.5 metres by 2150 under very high emissions \u2013 figures which, unlike the IPCC\u2019s, include the impact of melting ice sheets.\n\nCSIRO modelling for Melbourne\u2019s Port Phillip Bay, released in 2024, predicts council areas like Hobsons Bay, Greater Geelong, Frankston and Mornington Peninsula could see three times the current degree of sea level inundation under a scenario in which sea levels rise by 1.4 metres by 2100. Add king tides, extreme weather and storm surges, and it\u2019s a disastrous picture for anyone living within a few blocks of a beach. O\u2019Grady knows just how vulnerable Australia\u2019s coastline is, both as a scientist and as a beach lover. His family camps each year at Pambula Beach on the NSW South Coast. Several decades ago, a storm eroded the front row of campsites. The local community restored a wide, vegetated dune \u2013 a natural barrier that now protects the campsite and caravan park. \u201cMy kids hear the story every year,\u201d says O\u2019Grady, who explains to them that regular tides and even king tides are highly predictable. But it\u2019s the forces caused by anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change \u2013 leading to heavier rain events, more intense cyclones and rising sea levels caused by glacial melting and thermal expansion \u2013 that are pushing ocean water further onto land and increasing the potential for coastal erosion. O\u2019Grady and his team are tracking how often these events occur, how high sea levels rise during them and how climate change is increasing their frequency and intensity, and providing web-based tools and data for local councils. \u201cThe coastal councils are doing a great deal to understand and adapt,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we need to keep providing information about climate change and sea level rise and how that might impact the coast.\u201d Residents funded a controversial $17 million sea wall at Sydney\u2019s Collaroy-Narrabeen to protect property. Credit: James Alcock/SMH 2022 Coastal hotspots\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnvironmental scientists now favour natural strategies to lessen wave impact and slow coastal erosion. This includes beach nourishment, dune revegetation, retrofitting existing sea walls with more vegetation cover or, in some cases, creating artificial reefs offshore. In many local council areas, beach nourishment programs have been underway for years. On the Gold Coast, dredging ships suck up seafloor sediment and pump it back into surf zones, reinforcing dunes and widening the beach. \u201cDuring Cyclone Alfred, that extra sand made a real difference,\u201d O\u2019Grady says. \u201cBut what works in one place won\u2019t necessarily work somewhere else. Where nature-based solutions are not possible, protecting people\u2019s homes, businesses and infrastructure might require sea walls.\u201d Mention sea walls on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches and you might have to swim for cover. In June 2016, Collaroy-Narrabeen beach became an epicentre of coastal erosion after a violent East Coast low lashed the NSW coastline and stripped the region\u2019s beaches of sand. A home swimming pool teetering above the dunes at Collaroy made global news. In response, residents funded a $17 million, seven-metre-high concrete sea wall to protect their multimillion-dollar beachfront properties. State and local government tipped in $3.5 million. Furious locals, worried about beach access and accelerated erosion, protested, forming a human \u201cline in the sand\u201d. Expect to see more sea walls in targeted locations around Australia. Recent satellite imagery confirms that erosion is emerging not as a broad, sweeping pattern, but concentrated in known hotspots \u2013 especially around tidal inlets, hard structures and headlands where the coastline is more dynamic. In NSW, places such as Collaroy-Narrabeen, Cronulla and Palm Beach in Sydney; Wamberal Beach and The Entrance on the NSW Central Coast; and at Port Stephens, Yamba and Byron Bay further north. In Victoria, hotspots already showing accelerated change include Inverloch on the Bass Coast, Silverleaves on Port Phillip Island, and Apollo Bay and Port Fairy on the Great Ocean Road. Loading Inverloch, which is exposed to Bass Strait swells, has lost about two metres of beach per year since the 1990s, according to satellite imagery. Beach loss has accelerated since 2010, with scientists and locals describing it as \u201csignificant\u201d. A resilience plan, begun by the Victorian government in 2021 and released in draft form for comment in late 2024, recommends a range of solutions linked to specific environmental triggers. For now, it proposes \u201cadaptation\u201d (dune restoration and beach nourishment) and \u201caccommodation\u201d (lifting, upgrading or reinforcing houses, buildings and infrastructure). A sea level rise of 0.2 metres by 2040, or one of six specific triggers, would prompt \u201cmajor project engineering\u201d such as seawalls, groynes or breakwaters, followed by \u201cretreat\u201d at 0.5 metres by 2070 \u2013 decommissioning buildings and relocating homes. Locals say two triggers have already been met, and they\u2019ve watched the water creep higher year after year. They\u2019re worried there\u2019s still no plan for a sea wall and no talk of house buybacks. Inverloch SLSC president Glenn Arnold calls the Victorian coastal club the \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just money going down the drain, pushing sand around the beach,\u201d says Inverloch Surf Life Saving Club president Glenn Arnold. The surf club, perched atop a beach dune on the ocean side of the road, was sandbagged six years ago. Those sandbags are now failing, with large swells in recent months forcing Bass Coast Shire Council to undertake urgent sand re-nourishment works. The club is the \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d, says Arnold \u2013 and behind it lies several streets of oceanfront homes. \u201cNo one is panic-selling yet but in the past, there was a degree of complacency,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cPeople were thinking, \u2018Surely no council, no state government is going to let 300 to 400 houses sink into the ocean.\u2019 Now they want their voice heard. People\u2019s homes are at risk when they don\u2019t need to be. It\u2019s a simple fix, it just takes political will and money.\u201d Allison and Kim White, both 68, bought their beach house in Inverloch\u2019s Lohr Avenue in 2012 and have lived there full-time since COVID-19. Just one block from the beach, they\u2019ve had a front-row seat to the ocean\u2019s relentless advance. \u201cWe used to walk over three sand dunes to get to the water,\u201d says Kim. \u201cNow we walk over one-and-a-half. We can see the ocean from the road now. Before we couldn\u2019t.\u201d The Whites worry about young families with large mortgages who are anxious that house prices will plummet. For retirees like themselves, the financial threat is also confronting. \u201cRegardless of whether you are living here full-time or whether you own a beach house, the impact is the same,\u201d Allison says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge investment. For a lot of retirees, it\u2019s their last hurrah, their entire nest egg \u2013 all they have for their old age, their aged care and to leave their children.\u201d Inverloch surf club on the Victorian Bass Coast \u2013 with homes visible behind \u2013 in 2019, before it was sandbagged to safeguard it from dune erosion. Credit: Justin McManus The Whites say Inverloch\u2019s coastal erosion problem is well known to state politicians, but the urgency has not yet penetrated either political or public consciousness. They are concerned that there are no permanent engineering works planned \u2013 just more sand. For a potential funding solution, they point to Western Australia\u2019s Royalties for Regions program, where coastal towns like Esperance, Denmark and Geraldton have received direct, targeted investment. \u201cThey\u2019re talking the talk, but they\u2019re not walking the walk,\u201d Allison says of the Victorian state government. \u201cIt\u2019s happening before our eyes, and it\u2019s been happening for a long time. What is the cut-off point?\u201d It\u2019s a question the Whites can\u2019t bear to ask themselves. In their minds, they tally the collective value of homes at immediate risk \u2013 about 200 homes worth roughly $1 million each \u2013 plus the town\u2019s sewerage system, a caravan park and the RACV Club Resort. If the coast road is breached, the town will be cut off from Cape Paterson and the RACV resort, which is a major employer in the town, and vital infrastructure will be destroyed. The thought is overwhelming \u2013 for everyone. \u201cWe have not looked at an alternative, it\u2019s too depressing,\u201d says Allison. \u201cAt our stage of life, we\u2019re not ready for a retirement village. And I doubt whether any compensation you get back would be worth what you put in.\u201d The long view\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IPCC says coastal communities must take a long-term approach \u2013 100 years and beyond \u2013 to best respond to rising sea-water levels. It ranks beach nourishment as one of the least effective strategies \u2013 effective for around 15 years. Elevating houses keeps seas at bay for 30 years. Levees and sea walls work for about 50 and 100 years respectively. \u201cPlanned relocation\u201d is the most effective long-term solution of all. For someone who\u2019s studied his field for more than 20 years, coastal erosion expert Dr Mitchell Harley didn\u2019t start out as a beach lover. \u201cI was born and raised on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, but I wasn\u2019t your typical beach kid,\u201d says Harley. His passion for maths and science led him to a degree in environmental engineering, and later, a PhD \u2013 one that saw him driving a quad bike up and down Narrabeen beach every month for years, collecting data. \u201cIt sounded like a good gig,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I ended up studying coastlines.\u201d Coastline expert Dr Mitchell Harley wants councils to allow building only in zones that are safe from erosion. Harley is one of Australia\u2019s leading coastal researchers. He names the June 2016 East Coast low, which stripped sand from Collaroy-Narrabeen and other NSW beaches, as one of the most memorable events of his career. It was a moment that captured for him just how vulnerable Australia\u2019s built coastline is. \u201cI knew that beach [Narrabeen] like the back of my hand \u2013 and suddenly, it was unrecognisable. Just gone, overnight.\u201d Harley\u2019s research suggests that not all beaches will suffer equally. Some may look unchanged, while others could shrink rapidly or disappear altogether. In remote parts of the country, where there is little housing or infrastructure, beaches will migrate and we won\u2019t even notice. The real issue? Planning decisions made a century ago, and in the decades since. Loading \u201cPlaces like Collaroy and Narrabeen were zoned too close to the coast back in the early 1900s,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re still paying for those decisions 120 years later. But what really concerns me now is that we\u2019re making similar mistakes.\u201d Harley and his team work like storm-chasers, deploying technology and aircraft to scan all Australia\u2019s 11,000 beaches before and after extreme weather events. One of their most powerful tools is CoastSnap, a citizen science initiative where people use their smartphones to photograph beaches. Harley collates the photographs to measure and track beach erosion over time.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "It was part of a 16-minute post-match interview that effectively served as a confessional, during which he admitted he would not have been so frank in victory. He spoke similarly to fellow Australian Alex de Minaur, who revealed he was suffering from mental fatigue after his second-round defeat in Paris. Losing was what enabled players to finally realise what was going wrong, Popyrin said. \u201cMaking the second week of French Open for the first time; I didn\u2019t realise how much it takes out of, not only your physical, but mental capacity,\u201d Popyrin said. \u201cI have to not see a tennis court or a tennis racquet for a little bit. After today\u2019s match, I felt numb. I didn\u2019t feel sad, I didn\u2019t feel happy \u2013 I just felt numb, and that\u2019s not a feeling I\u2019ve ever had before.\u201d\n\nLike Popyrin, de Minaur said winning papered over the cracks of tennis players\u2019 struggles. Loading They deal with being on the road for many months each year, away from loved ones, while trying to absorb self-doubts and the pressure of a 12-month revolving rankings system with dire consequences for not matching results from a year earlier. Popyrin sits No.22 in the rankings but is 52nd in the single-season race. It is an indication of where his ranking could be headed in the months ahead as he defends more than half his points, including his historic Masters 1000 title in Canada and a fourth-round showing at the US Open, where he cut down Novak Djokovic.\n\n\u201cI need to relax and not think about the points that are coming off ... and just completely and utterly disconnect from tennis,\u201d Popyrin said. \u201cI know if I do that, I\u2019ll be able to play well again and make some results.\u201d De Minaur is workshopping a new approach with less focus on his ranking after he set and aggressively chased ambitious public goals in the past. But as defeats pile up on a tour where most weeks end that way, so do the doubts, as Kasatkina highlighted. They hurt so much more when they come in a bunch. Alexander Zverev: \u2018I feel very alone out there\u2019 There is, perhaps, less sympathy for Germany\u2019s Alexander Zverev than many others, but his surprise exit on Tuesday \u2013 amid a record-breaking tournament of ineptitude for seeded players \u2013 prompted a Popyrin-like public admission.\n\nThe world No.3 reached this year\u2019s Australian Open final and won the Munich title in his home country, but there were spotty results in between for a player of his standing. Zverev mostly fobbed off anyone who dared question his form until his Wimbledon flop. \u201cI feel very alone out there at times. I struggle mentally,\u201d Zverev said. Alexander Zverev said he was in a lonely spot at the moment. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that since after the Australian Open. I\u2019m trying to find ways to get out of this hole. I keep finding myself back in it, in a way. I feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice.\u201d Zverev, a three-time grand-slam tournament finalist who has twice fought allegations of domestic abuse, acknowledged he is now at breaking point and may seek therapy. \u201cMaybe for the first time in my life I\u2019ll probably need it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot of difficulties. I\u2019ve been through a lot of difficulties in the media. I\u2019ve been through a lot of difficulties in life generally.\u201d\n\nAryna Sabalenka: \u2018I had a therapist for five years\u2019 World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka urged Zverev to seek professional help, reflecting on her own long-term use of counselling. \u201cI had a therapist for five years in my career,\u201d she said after her win over Marie Bouzkova on Wednesday. \u201cI stopped I don\u2019t know, maybe in 2022. It\u2019s crazy to hear from someone like Alexander because he has surrounded himself with his family. World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka spoke about seeing a therapist to help her. Credit: Getty Images \u201cIt\u2019s really important to be open and to talk about what you\u2019re experiencing because if you\u2019re going to keep it inside, it\u2019s just going to destroy you. I think that\u2019s something happening to him.\u201d Madison Keys, whose Australian Open triumph in January came in her 46th grand slam, had spoken then about how therapy helped her play her best tennis and she said on Wednesday that mental health was being discussed more openly on the tours.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely got more open,\u201d Keys said. Loading \u201cI don\u2019t really remember it being a talking point much. I think more and more players are open to saying, \u2018I\u2019m talking to someone\u2019. I would say there\u2019s probably more of us that are speaking to someone now than there was before. \u201cWe have people every single week at tournaments, which is super helpful. Just to have that support, I think they\u2019ve done a really good job at really helping all of the players through what is a really tough career.\u201d There is different pressure for every player in the Wimbledon draw because grand slams bring together a cocktail of haves and have-nots.\n\nLoading Neither Sabalenka nor fellow grand slam champion Iga Swiatek has ever won the All England club title, something that would enhance their legacy. Maya Joint: \u2018Definitely going to get harder\u2019 But Sabalenka\u2019s first-round Wimbledon opponent, Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine, was driving for Uber Eats as recently as February to help fund her tennis career. Branstine\u2019s final delivery was the day before she flew to Cancun and reached her maiden WTA 125K final. The Australian who Branstine beat in the semi-finals at Cancun, 19-year-old Maya Joint, is at the beginning of her career but already understands the value of having support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sport where you\u2019re always on the road, and you\u2019re always in hotel rooms, so it can get pretty difficult,\u201d Joint said. \u201cI\u2019m really lucky with my coaches, and my mum\u2019s with me this week. I have family in Europe and family in Australia, so it\u2019s good to try and find a balance, but it\u2019s definitely going to get harder, the longer I\u2019m on tour.\u201d With Reuters For help, beyondblue1300 22 4636 Marc McGowan travelled to Wimbledon with the support of Tennis Australia",

    "text": "Since assuming control in 2021, the Australian Professional Leagues have struggled to find a working formula to convert the many millions who watch the national teams and overseas leagues, or play the game, into fans of the A-Leagues. After the collapse of the bold KeepUp experiment, the APL has been gripped by financial turmoil, with distributions to clubs falling by almost $1.5 million to just $530,000, and ongoing material concerns about the ability of some clubs to stay afloat. Johnson does not believe unbundling was a mistake, and said there are plenty of examples across world football in which healthy leagues are run independently of their national federation. Asked for his opinion on how the A-League can improve, he said the key was connecting it into global football: a strategy he said was proven by the 2015 Asian Cup and the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, and will be again by the 2026 Women\u2019s Asian Cup. \u201cThat\u2019s where there is no other sport that can compete with football, when we are hardwired in and connected to global football,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not so much about what\u2019s holding us back - it\u2019s what propels us forward. That\u2019s the space we need to continue to play. Because I think that as soon as you bring those [tournaments] back, the handbrakes are off.\n\n\u201cYou get the football community, the stakeholders, focused on the competition and the legacy that can be provided, and I think that\u2019s where we have seen our quickest growth. So I think implementing a strategy for more global competitions is something that allows the handbrakes to come off.\u201d Johnson had previously flagged FA\u2019s desire to bid for the hosting rights for the new Club World Cup, and believes that should be a high priority for the game in the coming years. Al Hilal player celebrate their shock win over Manchester City in the FIFA Club World Cup. Credit: Getty Images Despite widespread scepticism across Europe, the first edition of the rebooted tournament - currently being played in the United States - is proving a worthy addition to football\u2019s calendar, albeit with the caveat that the calendar itself is jam-packed and at risk of burning out overworked players. The next edition will be held in 2029, and potential hosts are already lining up, including Brazil, Qatar, a combined Spain-Portugal-Morocco bid, and the United States again.\n\nAn Australian bid, Johnson said, would be extremely appealing to FIFA because of its ability to reach different timezones across Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s a competition that I think will, iteration after iteration, get bigger and bigger. It would be a great competition to bring to Australia,\u201d Johnson said. Lionel Messi and the FIFA Club World Cup trophy. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThat\u2019s when I think football becomes interesting to government. Today you have the millions and millions that will watch the Socceroos and Matildas and the millions and millions that play. If the strategy is to ensure that they are watching the A-League, I think the best way to do that ... is to connect the A-League to global club competitions, whether that be the Premier League, Champions League, or the hosting of a major club competition. I think it just adds another element to the game here that we haven\u2019t seen. \u201cThe beneficiaries of the Women\u2019s World Cup were the national teams and community football. The beneficiaries of a Club World Cup would be the clubs.\u201d\n\nJohnson also said FA should not give up hope of hosting the men\u2019s World Cup, despite being railroaded out of a bid for the 2034 edition by Saudi Arabia. \u201cI believe Australia will one day host a men\u2019s World Cup. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if,\u201d he said. \u201cI think our 2010 bid was too early, and it\u2019s easy to say that in hindsight. But if you look at what we\u2019ve accomplished since then \u2026 we\u2019re steadily building a strong track record. If we continue hosting major global tournaments, even youth competitions, we\u2019ll become a country like the United States, Canada, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia - nations that are now considered \u2018normal\u2019 hosts for major events. I believe we\u2019re already on that trajectory. \u201cWe need to keep doing the work, and all of us have a responsibility to maintain the pressure and continue bringing major competitions to our region.\u201d There is another way to connect the A-Leagues to global club football: through broadcasting, another area which is unrecognisable in Australia compared to when Johnson began at FA in late 2019.\n\nOptus Sport is shutting down, having on-sold their football rights packages - headed by the Premier League - to Stan Sport, which is owned by Nine, the publishers of this masthead. That deal means that, for the first time since 2016, the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League are on the same platform again. Loading Meanwhile, the APL is currently in negotiations for a new broadcast agreement. The current contract with Network 10 and Paramount + to show the A-Leagues expires at the end of the 2025-26 season. Though Nine has shown interest, a short-term extension is expected with the incumbent rights holders - and that would lead to a situation where all of the major football rights deals in Australia, including the A-Leagues, Socceroos and Matildas, and Premier League, will all be in market at roughly the same time. \u201cThis landscape is changing rapidly, but one thing remains constant,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen you look at where the football audience is, and if we step back from just thinking about Australian football, and instead see ourselves as part of global football here in Australia - that\u2019s how I view it - you\u2019ll notice that audiences naturally gravitate toward certain properties: World Cups, the Euros, Champions League, Premier League, national team football.",

Oops. The Hour of Power Sydney toilet-jokes format on KIIS caused the pair to take a colossal gutser in Melbourne from the start. A year on, their latest rating is a measly 5.1 per cent, placing the show eighth in Melbourne\u2019s breakfast slot.\n\nFor context, number one is the familiar Ross and Russ show on 3AW, where Melbourne locals Ross Stevenson and Russel Howcroft hold a mighty 20.6 per cent share of the city\u2019s breakfast audience, largely by avoiding insulting listeners\u2019 intelligence.

I love Melbourne, the garden city of Australia.\u201d Six months later, Keating and his government were booted out and he retired to his beloved Sydney. Even Sydney\u2019s criminal milieu could not cut it in Melbourne. My colleague John Silvester relates the amusing story of Sydney crook Stan \u201cThe Man\u201d Smith\u2019s abortive attempt to expand his criminal pursuits into Melbourne decades ago.\n\nLoading \u201cWhen he arrived at Tullamarine airport, waiting police miraculously found a matchbox full of hashish in the top outside jacket pocket \u2013 usually only used to display a decorative handkerchief,\u201d Silvester wrote. \u201cSmith is said to have cried out, \u2018I\u2019m being fitted up\u2019, no doubt a reference to his dapper, tailor-made suit. When he returned home (after serving one year), he vowed to never return to Melbourne because \u2018the cops run red-hot down there\u2019.\u201d The fact that Melburnians have rarely bought Sydneysiders\u2019 pretensions was long attributed to Melbourne wearing a chip on its shoulder because Sydney was the first city established in Australia, and was blessed with greater natural beauty. A friend has a more nuanced view.\n\nMelbourne, she proposes, has always had to try harder to build itself a beating heart because it was not blessed with Sydney\u2019s astonishing natural loveliness. How could Melbourne and its Yarra and its tame bay compete with Sydney\u2019s glorious ocean beaches, the great sweep of its harbour, its cliffs and river gorges and the Blue Mountains hovering away to the west? The answer, of course, was to get serious and accomplished. About food, conversation, architecture, education and sport, for starters. Sydneysiders could afford to play in the sun and the surf and merrily flaunt their wealth. Melburnians hunkered beneath often leaden skies and worked at building a relatively sophisticated, relatively civil society, replete with marvellous restaurants and the nation\u2019s oldest and most visited art gallery, named (immodestly) the National Gallery of Victoria.",

Treatment\u2019s done, then it\u2019s like, \u2018I can crack on, get back to normal\u2019, but actually, the phase afterwards is really difficult. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily under the clinical team any longer, but you\u2019re not able to function normally at home as you perhaps once used to. Despite heavy rain, the Princess of Wales stopped to take selfies and talk with staff and visitors. Credit: Getty Images \u201cAnd actually, someone to help talk you through that, show you and guide you through that sort of phase that comes after treatment, I think, is really valuable. The centre provides therapy, community groups and holistic treatments, including reflexology.\n\nLoading The princess, speaking to therapist Amanda Green during a walkabout in heavy rain afterwards, disclosed that she had not yet tried reflexology but had received acupuncture. The discussions were the princess\u2019 most personal and extensive insights into her experience. \u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThrough first diagnosis or post-treatment and things like that, it is a life-changing experience \u2013 both for the patient, but also for the families as well. \u201cAnd actually, it sometimes goes unrecognised. You don\u2019t necessarily \u2013 particularly when it\u2019s the first time [of diagnosis] \u2013 appreciate how much impact it is going to have.\n\n\u201cYou have to find your new normal and that takes time \u2026 and it\u2019s a rollercoaster, it\u2019s not one smooth plane, which you expect it to be. But the reality is it\u2019s not, you go through hard times. \u201cAnd to have a place like this to have the support network, through creativity and singing or gardening, whatever it might be, is so valuable and it\u2019s great this community has it. \u201cIt would be great if lots of communities had this kind of support.\u201d Speaking to patients, including those whose cancer had returned and one who had lost his husband to cancer, the princess asked how the centre had helped them.\n\n\u201cThat first-time diagnosis is a very scary journey,\u201d she said, referring to the benefits of having an on-site hospital support network where many volunteers have had cancer themselves and survived. Many newly diagnosed patients at Colchester Hospital now visit the centre immediately for counselling and advice. Loading \u201cTo feel a sense of hope and positivity [from speaking to people who have already been through it] is such a positive thing in what is otherwise a very scary and daunting experience,\u201d the princess said. She added that \u201cscience has told us that the mind, body and spirit experience is so important\u201d, asking if the hospital\u2019s clinical team gave any feedback about how the wellness centre had affected patients. After around an hour at the centre, Princess Catherine moved into the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Wellbeing Garden at Colchester Hospital, where she helped plant roses named after her.\n\nGetting her hands dirty and asking if she could do a bit more work, the princess dug alongside Adam Frost, the television garden designer, telling him she was feeling \u201cgood\u201d and pleased to be able to work outside. In the pouring rain, as the engagement overran by about 30 minutes, she told hospital staff and patients who had waited outside to see her: \u201cI\u2019m just washing my hands \u2013 I\u2019ll be back.\u201d The Princess of Wales literally got her hands dirty planting roses in the wellbeing garden. The visit coincides with the donation of 50 Catherine\u2019s Roses, named in her honour. Credit: Getty Images She then undertook a walkabout, posing for selfies and group photographs in between asking people about their day. Kensington Palace said the princess was there to \u201ccelebrate the incredible healing power of nature and raise awareness of the important role that spending time in nature plays in bringing us joy and supporting our mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing\u201d.\n\nLoading The princess arrived at Colchester Hospital with little fanfare, walking through the public garden as one mother told her little girl: \u201cThat\u2019s a real-life princess, there!\u201d Meeting staff inside, the princess praised the hospital\u2019s continuity of care and the network of volunteers, which saw former patients returning to help others. \u201cIt must make a difference to people coming in here, in knowing there are people who have been through it too,\u201d she said. \u201cEven through the hard times and loss, there is a sense of hope and community through a space like this.\u201d \u201cFrom personal experience,\u201d the princess added, holistic support during recovery \u201cwas that lifeline you need post-treatment, when you\u2019re not receiving continuous care\u201d.\n\n\u2018A mind, body and spirit perspective\u2019 The centre includes support groups as well as massage, reflexology, a family practitioner, advice on wig fittings, and a \u201ccancer choir\u201d. The Princess of Wales posed with staff during her visit. She praised the continuity of care the hospital provided. Credit: Getty Images \u201cIt\u2019s looking at treatment and recovery as complementary,\u201d the princess said. \u201cLooking at it from a mind, body and spirit perspective really matters. It\u2019s great, well done.\u201d \u201cHaving gone through it myself,\u201d she added, she could now better understand the challenges of finding support.\n\nLoading \u201cSome people don\u2019t have access and don\u2019t necessarily know how this system can help them,\u201d she said. \u201cJoining the dots for patients and families \u2026 while there might be fantastic community work going on, if it\u2019s bitty and there isn\u2019t one place and one body bringing these support networks together, it\u2019s hard to reach out, particularly when you\u2019re vulnerable. I can see it has such a transformative effect.\u201d Hearing about the centre\u2019s choir, the princess added: \u201cHaving these creative avenues is really fantastic.\u201d Princess Catherine carried a mug of tea as she spoke to patients and volunteers, joking that \u201cas a parent, you know you\u2019ll keep losing your cup of tea\u201d otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the patients, it\u2019s the family too,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the cancer care, treatment, healing, it\u2019s about the whole person \u2013 mind, body and spirit. We know now that all those three dimensions matter to the recovery journey.\u201d\n\nThe wellbeing garden at Colchester Hospital, which opened in July 2024, is intended to be a \u201crelaxing and restorative space for NHS staff, patients and visitors\u201d and hosts activities for those in or visiting the hospital. The garden is taking part in research for the RHS\u2019s Blueprint for Wellbeing Gardens, which will launch in spring next year. The visit came with a donation of 50 Catherine\u2019s Rose plants, named for the princess by the RHS, with funds from sales going to the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. A total of 500 Catherine\u2019s Rose plants will be donated to well-being and community gardens across the UK this summer, including Maggie\u2019s gardens for people affected by cancer, East Anglia\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospices and Horatio\u2019s Gardens for those living with spinal injuries. Meanwhile, Queen Camilla has hailed the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Maggie\u2019s cancer care centres while on a visit in Kirkcaldy, Scotland.\n\nThe Queen, 77, is president of Maggie\u2019s and spent the morning visiting one of its 24 centres while her daughter-in-law spoke candidly about her \u201crollercoaster\u201d experience after cancer treatment. During the visit, Camilla spoke about the \u201cbrilliant\u201d care that Maggie\u2019s centres offered cancer patients and their families, adding that \u201cthere is something so special about them\u201d. Queen Camilla visiting Maggie\u2019s in Scotland. Credit: Getty Images The Queen also met with the charity\u2019s founder and chief executive, Dame Laura Lee. Speaking afterwards, Dame Laura said: \u201cIt is always a joy to welcome her majesty to one of our centres, especially one she has never been to before. \u201cAs always, she was incredibly generous with her time and listened closely to our centre visitors as they shared their stories. We are so grateful for her continued support.\u201d\n\nLoading As part of the engagement, Camilla also met people living with cancer, similarly to her husband, the King, who is receiving ongoing treatment. Maggie\u2019s provides free psychological, emotional and practical support for anyone living with the disease, as well as their family and friends. The Queen was also greeted on Wednesday by Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, and Kirsty Wark, who are honorary patrons of the charity. The Telegraph, London",

    "text": "The final increase to the superannuation guarantee has taken effect, meaning employers are now required to pay a minimum contribution of 12 per cent into their employees' super funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut around a third of people are unaware where their retirement funds are invested \u2014 a similar proportion don't know their super balance, and one in 10 have never checked.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese were the findings of a survey of 3,146 Australians conducted by the Commonwealth Bank, which suggested the knowledge gap about how super is invested was higher among gen Z and women, at 43 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Irvine, the bank's personal finance expert, said people have more confidence in managing their day-to-day finances, but need more assistance to understand retirement options.\n\n\n\n\n\nEchoing her views, Wayne Swan, the former federal treasurer who oversaw the legislation guaranteeing the increase from nine to 12 per cent, told SBS News that more needed to be done to engage Australians with their retirement planning.\n\n\n\nSwan, now chair of Cbus, an industry super fund, said: \"I think that all superannuation funds acknowledge and do their best to achieve [that], and there's always more that can be done.\"\n\n\n\nWhat is happening with superannuation?\n\nThirty-four years ago, former prime minister Paul Keating shared his vision of an Australian future that included a 12 per cent target for compulsory super contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, he said, that system \"finally matures\".\n\n\n\nThe superannuation guarantee has risen since 2012 to reach 12 per cent. In a statement to mark the 1 July increase to 12 per cent, Keating said it \"will guarantee personal super accumulations in excess of $3 million at retirement\" for someone entering the workforce today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Superannuation, like Medicare, is now an Australian community standard, binding the whole population as a national economic family, with each person having a place,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nSuperannuation in Australia stretches back to the early 20th century, but there were no attempts to institutionalise universal compulsory contributions before the mid-1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1985, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with the support of the then-Hawke government, presented a National Wage Case to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission about a 3 per cent compulsory contribution for all Australian workers.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Super on top of paid parental leave: How new scheme will work and who will benefit\n\nThe tribunal sided with the union in 1986 but ruled it as optional \u2014 subject to agreement between employers and employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years later, in Keating's final federal budget as treasurer, the 3 per cent superannuation guarantee levy was made compulsory.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt came into effect the following year, when Keating was prime minister, with the introduction of a superannuation guarantee charge to penalise employers who don't meet their contribution obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mandatory rate then gradually increased to 9 per cent by 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was supposed to reach 12 per cent by 2000, but, under the Howard government, there were no further increases until 1 July 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, two years after the Global Financial Crisis and in response to the findings of the Henry Tax Review, then-treasurer Swan unveiled a plan to incrementally lift the superannuation guarantee levy to 12 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it would increase by 0.5 per cent each year between 2013 and 2019.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, then-treasurer Wayne Swan (pictured right) announced a plan to gradually increase the superannuation guarantee levy from 9 per cent to 12 per cent. Source: AAP / Alan Porritt But two months after it rose to 9.25 per cent in 2013, Tony Abbott stormed to a landslide election victory \u2014 and followed through on an election promise to delay increases to the guarantee due to cost pressures on small businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government failed to legislate the delay the following year, and the rate was lifted to 9.5 per cent \u2014 a level it remained at for seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until Australia was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that the incremental increases began.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting in 2021, it rose by 0.5 per cent each year.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO SBS speaks to former Treasurer Wayne Swan on Australia's new super guarantee SBS News 30/06/2025 08:22 English\n\nThe 12 per cent milestone\n\nAustralia's superannuation system now manages over $4 trillion in assets, ranking as the fourth-largest pension market in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 12 per cent milestone is expected to propel Australia to second place within a decade \u2014 just behind the United States \u2014 despite its relatively small population.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwan said the superannuation guarantee levy not only delivers a secure retirement for all Australians, but \"fundamentally alters the distribution of wealth in our community\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It gives access to growth assets to everyone in the community. From a building worker through to a professional in the office tower, everyone in Australia gets to own a piece of the wealth of this great country in a way that's never before been possible,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSwan said he's \"absolutely proud to have been part of this story\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I always think of those pioneers, particularly the unionists, who fought to establish this scheme 40 years ago. What it really shows is that ordinary working people can effect change in a society like ours,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What visionaries they were, and what they have done to make our country not only a bigger and more successful economy, but a fairer one as well.\"\n\n\n\nWhat is a 'comfortable retirement'?\n\nSwan said while the six-year delay in achieving a 12 per cent increase came at a cost to Australian superannuation balances, the benefits are greater from having finally reached that milestone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For someone who's, say, 30 years old now, it's going to mean an extra $130,000 in their retirement,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat follows recent modelling by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe super peak body's retirement standard for June 2025 projects a 30-year-old today on the median wage of $75,000 and a $30,000 super balance would witness that figure rise to $610,000 by the retirement age of 67.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis amount exceeds ASFA's estimate of the $595,000 needed to afford a comfortable retirement for singles and $690,000 for couples.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The new amount Australians need each year to retire comfortably\n\nASFA defines a 'comfortable' retirement as someone who owns their home outright, is in good health, can afford top-level private health insurance, has a good car, and engages in a range of leisure and recreational activities, including taking one domestic trip a year and one international trip every seven years.\n\n\n\nBusiness concerns\n\nThere are concerns that a string of 1 July changes , including the increase to the superannuation guarantee levy, could hit businesses and place further pressure on cash flow.\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke Achterstraat, CEO, Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, said: \"The increase of the superannuation guarantee comes at a time when award rates have also increased 3.5 per cent, national productivity is in decline, and payroll tax and workers' compensation insurance will also increase.\"\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that an increase to the superannuation guarantee levy and other changes that took effect on 1 July could negatively impact small businesses and further pressure their cash flow. Source: AAP \"This puts small businesses between a rock and a hard place, needing to either absorb or pass on these costs to consumers,\" Achterstraat said.\n\n\n\nBeyond 12 per cent: Where to from here?\n\nThe 0.5 per cent increase to 12 per cent is the last one legislated by the Australian government.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, with life expectancy improving, would we need more in our nest egg, and is there a case for raising the superannuation guarantee even further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there's going to be a debate about whether we need to go above 12 per cent,\" Swan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think 12 per cent can certainly guarantee quite a dignified retirement for all Australians, but that will be a discussion that will be had in the years ahead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Further complicating matters is that the administration has imposed the 10 per cent baseline tariff rate, foreshadowed the so-called reciprocal tariffs (there\u2019s nothing reciprocal about them) and has already imposed additional sectoral tariffs on steel and aluminium, products derived from those metals, autos and auto parts and foreshadowed more of those targeted tariffs. That makes the negotiations multidimensional and the overall outcome, once there is one, very messy. Each of America\u2019s major trading partners will have unique deals \u2013 a mix of an overall rate plus the sectoral tariffs \u2013 whether negotiated or imposed. US companies and consumers will pay the price for Trump\u2019s trade war. Credit: Bloomberg The agreement with Vietnam, and what\u2019s known about discussions with other major trading partners, provide some insights into what the US is trying to achieve, although details are sketchy \u2013 Trump announced the deal with Vietnam on his Truth Social platform. \u201cVietnam will pay the United States a 20 per cent tariff on any and all goods sent into our Territory, and a 40 per cent Tariff on any Transhipping. In return, Vietnam will do something they have never done before, give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade,\u201d Trump wrote (in his usual unique style).\n\n\u201cIn other words, they will \u2018OPEN THE MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,\u2019 meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff,\u201d he wrote. Trump thinks Vietnam, with per capita incomes of about $US4500, would be a good market for American SUVs, whose prices range from $US30,000 to about $US80,000! Loading Leaving aside the reality that it won\u2019t be the Vietnamese paying the import duties but the US importers, the rate on Vietnam\u2019s export to the US has just doubled. During Trump\u2019s trade war with China in his first term, a lot of companies that had used China as their manufacturing base shifted their factories to Vietnam. Others set up entities that finished semi-manufactured products from China to qualify as Vietnamese sourced products and there were those who simply re-labelled Chinese products as made in Vietnam. Since then, exports from Vietnam to the US have soared. Last year, for instance they jumped 33 per cent. Vietnam exported $US136.6 billion ($A207.5 billion) of goods to the US in 2024 but imported only $US13 billion.\n\nThe 40 per cent rate for \u201ctranshipping\u201d is squarely aimed at China, which is acutely aware that in most of the negotiations the US is trying to restrict efforts by Chinese companies to circumvent the 55 per cent tariff the US has imposed on its exports to the US and reduce its trade with third countries and access to global supply chains. Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation\u201d of America will come at a heavy cost. The deal with Vietnam will, if it can be policed (a major \u201cif\u201d for all these trade deals), hit China\u2019s exports of components and the rebadging of Chinese goods as \u201cMade in Vietnam.\u201d Similar demands are being made of the EU and other Asian and Latin American economies, some of which (including Germany) have significantly greater trade relationships with China than they do with the US. China has already warned that it won\u2019t accept US attempts to throttle its exports, with the Ministry of Commerce saying last weekend that \u201cof this happened, China will never accept it and will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d\n\nChina, of course, has a more powerful trade weapon than Trump\u2019s tariffs that it can deploy. It demonstrated in the trade confrontation with the US earlier this year, when there was an exchange of absurdly high tariffs that ended in an uneasy truce, that its dominance of rare earths can be weaponised. There\u2019s not much advanced manufacturing that can occur without access to rare earths and rare earth magnets \u2013 China could shut down the US auto industry almost overnight by cutting off supply and do substantial damage to America\u2019s defence capabilities. It could also use that leverage against countries co-operating with the US to shrink its exports. Trump\u2019s attempt to dictate lop-sided terms of trade with America\u2019s trade partners hasn\u2019t been as straightforward as he anticipated because they impinge on other countries sovereignty and are complicated by their domestic politics. Trump thinks Vietnam, with per capita incomes of about $US4500, would be a good market for American SUVs, whose prices range from $US30,000 to about $US80,000. Credit: Getty Negotiations with Japan have stalled because the US has imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Japan\u2019s auto exports and Trump has demanded Japan open its heavily protected market to American rice.\n\nJapan\u2019s auto industry generated about 10 per cent of its GDP and employs about 8 per cent of its workforce. While it exports about 1.4 million cars a year to the US, it makes a lot more \u2013 about 3.3 million a year \u2013 within the US. Japan\u2019s trade negotiators have made it clear that, while they are happy to commit to buying a lot more LNG and military equipment from US, the tariff on its auto exports is a dealbreaker. Rice is another non-negotiable, even though Japan is experiencing a shortage of the staple. The agricultural lobby within Japan is powerful and its support critical to the ruling Liberal Democrat Party, which faces an election later this month. That suggests its tariff will be set at 24 per cent \u2013 the rate announced on April 2 \u2013 although Trump has said that, if there is no deal, it could be 35 per cent \u201cor whatever the number is.\u201d Trump\u2019s 10 per cent baseline, sectoral and China tariffs have already raised the effective tariff rate on imports to the US from around 2.5 per cent into the mid-teens.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size On April 1, just before midnight, as a 2.1-metre king tide smashed the NSW coastline, real estate agent and father-to-be Steve Psomadelis got up for a drink of water. Underneath the floorboards of his low-set 1950s brick house at Dolls Point, on the southern reaches of Sydney\u2019s Botany Bay, he could hear the sound of gushing water. The tide had breached the seawall protecting the foreshore, inundating the waterfront promenade, main roadway and beachfront houses. At the Psomadelises\u2019 house, a block back from the beach, water was seeping into the laundry and lapping at the sunroom doors. In the driveway, the bonnet of his wife\u2019s car was underwater. \u201cI called out to my wife, \u2018We\u2019re flooding,\u2019 \u201d Psomadelis recalls. Minutes later, seawater was swirling above the top step. Just as Psomadelis and his pregnant wife Stephanie were attempting to climb out a side window, the SES arrived to evacuate them. \u201cWe grabbed the cat and got out of there,\u201d Psomadelis says. His street flooded to knee-height, along with the beachfront strip and two neighbouring streets. Water rose through the floorboards of their house, and sand was dumped across their front yard. They lost two fridges and a couch, and Stephanie\u2019s car was a write-off. Between rising sea levels and more frequent extreme-weather events, Australia\u2019s coastlines are being battered by the very visible effects of climate change. Has the dream of living by the beach become a nightmare? And what will Australia\u2019s coastlines look like in decades to come? \u201cThe April king tide was a once-in-50-year event, and it\u2019s happened twice in the last 10 years,\u201d says Psomadelis, who bought his house in 2022, seven years after Dolls Point last flooded in the April 2015 king tide. His neighbours \u2013 some who have lived there for decades \u2013 also blame infrastructure interventions on Botany Bay including two airport runways and a desalination plant, which they say have changed tidal patterns. \u201cIs it worth it? Yeah, for a place like this, it is,\u201d says Psomadelis. \u201cI can see the beach, and it\u2019s a beautiful area. We won\u2019t leave over something like this.\u201d The Psomadelises\u2019 house, a block back from Botany Bay, flooded in this year\u2019s king tide. Credit: Courtesy of Steve Psomadelises Only just the beginning The bad news for Australia\u2019s coast-loving communities is that rising sea levels are leading to more frequent and extreme events, resulting in severe coastal erosion and inundation of low-lying areas. The drivers behind coastal erosion are complex: tidal patterns, storm systems, ocean temperatures and broader climate cycles like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. But rising sea levels complicate the picture further. The recent east coast low, described by meteorologists as a \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d, and the first to hit the NSW coast since 2022, has brought the topic into sharp focus. It\u2019s likely to cause coastal erosion and damage to infrastructure between Seal Rocks and the NSW-Victorian border. UNSW coastal erosion expert Associate Professor Mitchell Harley says there\u2019s no evidence that east coast lows have become more frequent or severe in recent years. However, rising sea levels means their impact on the built coastline will be more profound. East coast lows are the subject of ongoing research, says Harley, as present climate models lack the resolution to truly capture their unpredictable behaviour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSea levels have been on an upward trajectory since records were first collected in the 1880s. But satellite monitoring over the past three decades shows a clear pattern: not only are sea levels rising, the rate is accelerating. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) sixth report, published in 2021, found a global mean sea level rise per year of 3.2 millimetres from 1993 to 2015, and 3.6 millimetres between 2006 and 2015. A 2024 NASA analysis of satellite data found a faster than expected rise last year alone, largely due to thermal expansion of seawater. Scientists had anticipated an increase of 4.3 millimetres but instead recorded 5.9 millimetres \u2013 a direct result of 2024 being the hottest year on record. Though these increments sound minuscule, the impact on coastal communities can be monumental. \u201cAs a general rule of thumb, for every 10 centimetres of sea level rise, you might see three times more extreme flooding events, depending on your location,\u201d says Dr Julian O\u2019Grady, a sea level scientist with the CSIRO. The IPCC\u2019s projections for sea level rise are sobering. They vary depending on location and whether we can meet Paris Agreement emissions targets. Even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the IPCC is predicting global sea level rises of 0.15-0.23 metres by 2050. By 2100, under very high emission scenarios, it could be 1 metre. Extreme sea level events that occurred once per century will be 20 to 30 times more frequent by 2050, the IPCC says. Along the NSW coast, state government data predicts rises of up to 2.3 metres by 2100 and 5.5 metres by 2150 under very high emissions \u2013 figures which, unlike the IPCC\u2019s, include the impact of melting ice sheets.\n\nCSIRO modelling for Melbourne\u2019s Port Phillip Bay, released in 2024, predicts council areas like Hobsons Bay, Greater Geelong, Frankston and Mornington Peninsula could see three times the current degree of sea level inundation under a scenario in which sea levels rise by 1.4 metres by 2100. Add king tides, extreme weather and storm surges, and it\u2019s a disastrous picture for anyone living within a few blocks of a beach. O\u2019Grady knows just how vulnerable Australia\u2019s coastline is, both as a scientist and as a beach lover. His family camps each year at Pambula Beach on the NSW South Coast. Several decades ago, a storm eroded the front row of campsites. The local community restored a wide, vegetated dune \u2013 a natural barrier that now protects the campsite and caravan park. \u201cMy kids hear the story every year,\u201d says O\u2019Grady, who explains to them that regular tides and even king tides are highly predictable. But it\u2019s the forces caused by anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change \u2013 leading to heavier rain events, more intense cyclones and rising sea levels caused by glacial melting and thermal expansion \u2013 that are pushing ocean water further onto land and increasing the potential for coastal erosion. O\u2019Grady and his team are tracking how often these events occur, how high sea levels rise during them and how climate change is increasing their frequency and intensity, and providing web-based tools and data for local councils. \u201cThe coastal councils are doing a great deal to understand and adapt,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we need to keep providing information about climate change and sea level rise and how that might impact the coast.\u201d Residents funded a controversial $17 million sea wall at Sydney\u2019s Collaroy-Narrabeen to protect property. Credit: James Alcock/SMH 2022 Coastal hotspots\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnvironmental scientists now favour natural strategies to lessen wave impact and slow coastal erosion. This includes beach nourishment, dune revegetation, retrofitting existing sea walls with more vegetation cover or, in some cases, creating artificial reefs offshore. In many local council areas, beach nourishment programs have been underway for years. On the Gold Coast, dredging ships suck up seafloor sediment and pump it back into surf zones, reinforcing dunes and widening the beach. \u201cDuring Cyclone Alfred, that extra sand made a real difference,\u201d O\u2019Grady says. \u201cBut what works in one place won\u2019t necessarily work somewhere else. Where nature-based solutions are not possible, protecting people\u2019s homes, businesses and infrastructure might require sea walls.\u201d Mention sea walls on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches and you might have to swim for cover. In June 2016, Collaroy-Narrabeen beach became an epicentre of coastal erosion after a violent East Coast low lashed the NSW coastline and stripped the region\u2019s beaches of sand. A home swimming pool teetering above the dunes at Collaroy made global news. In response, residents funded a $17 million, seven-metre-high concrete sea wall to protect their multimillion-dollar beachfront properties. State and local government tipped in $3.5 million. Furious locals, worried about beach access and accelerated erosion, protested, forming a human \u201cline in the sand\u201d. Expect to see more sea walls in targeted locations around Australia. Recent satellite imagery confirms that erosion is emerging not as a broad, sweeping pattern, but concentrated in known hotspots \u2013 especially around tidal inlets, hard structures and headlands where the coastline is more dynamic. In NSW, places such as Collaroy-Narrabeen, Cronulla and Palm Beach in Sydney; Wamberal Beach and The Entrance on the NSW Central Coast; and at Port Stephens, Yamba and Byron Bay further north. In Victoria, hotspots already showing accelerated change include Inverloch on the Bass Coast, Silverleaves on Port Phillip Island, and Apollo Bay and Port Fairy on the Great Ocean Road. Loading Inverloch, which is exposed to Bass Strait swells, has lost about two metres of beach per year since the 1990s, according to satellite imagery. Beach loss has accelerated since 2010, with scientists and locals describing it as \u201csignificant\u201d. A resilience plan, begun by the Victorian government in 2021 and released in draft form for comment in late 2024, recommends a range of solutions linked to specific environmental triggers. For now, it proposes \u201cadaptation\u201d (dune restoration and beach nourishment) and \u201caccommodation\u201d (lifting, upgrading or reinforcing houses, buildings and infrastructure). A sea level rise of 0.2 metres by 2040, or one of six specific triggers, would prompt \u201cmajor project engineering\u201d such as seawalls, groynes or breakwaters, followed by \u201cretreat\u201d at 0.5 metres by 2070 \u2013 decommissioning buildings and relocating homes. Locals say two triggers have already been met, and they\u2019ve watched the water creep higher year after year. They\u2019re worried there\u2019s still no plan for a sea wall and no talk of house buybacks. Inverloch SLSC president Glenn Arnold calls the Victorian coastal club the \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just money going down the drain, pushing sand around the beach,\u201d says Inverloch Surf Life Saving Club president Glenn Arnold. The surf club, perched atop a beach dune on the ocean side of the road, was sandbagged six years ago. Those sandbags are now failing, with large swells in recent months forcing Bass Coast Shire Council to undertake urgent sand re-nourishment works. The club is the \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d, says Arnold \u2013 and behind it lies several streets of oceanfront homes. \u201cNo one is panic-selling yet but in the past, there was a degree of complacency,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cPeople were thinking, \u2018Surely no council, no state government is going to let 300 to 400 houses sink into the ocean.\u2019 Now they want their voice heard. People\u2019s homes are at risk when they don\u2019t need to be. It\u2019s a simple fix, it just takes political will and money.\u201d Allison and Kim White, both 68, bought their beach house in Inverloch\u2019s Lohr Avenue in 2012 and have lived there full-time since COVID-19. Just one block from the beach, they\u2019ve had a front-row seat to the ocean\u2019s relentless advance. \u201cWe used to walk over three sand dunes to get to the water,\u201d says Kim. \u201cNow we walk over one-and-a-half. We can see the ocean from the road now. Before we couldn\u2019t.\u201d The Whites worry about young families with large mortgages who are anxious that house prices will plummet. For retirees like themselves, the financial threat is also confronting. \u201cRegardless of whether you are living here full-time or whether you own a beach house, the impact is the same,\u201d Allison says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge investment. For a lot of retirees, it\u2019s their last hurrah, their entire nest egg \u2013 all they have for their old age, their aged care and to leave their children.\u201d Inverloch surf club on the Victorian Bass Coast \u2013 with homes visible behind \u2013 in 2019, before it was sandbagged to safeguard it from dune erosion. Credit: Justin McManus The Whites say Inverloch\u2019s coastal erosion problem is well known to state politicians, but the urgency has not yet penetrated either political or public consciousness. They are concerned that there are no permanent engineering works planned \u2013 just more sand. For a potential funding solution, they point to Western Australia\u2019s Royalties for Regions program, where coastal towns like Esperance, Denmark and Geraldton have received direct, targeted investment. \u201cThey\u2019re talking the talk, but they\u2019re not walking the walk,\u201d Allison says of the Victorian state government. \u201cIt\u2019s happening before our eyes, and it\u2019s been happening for a long time. What is the cut-off point?\u201d It\u2019s a question the Whites can\u2019t bear to ask themselves. In their minds, they tally the collective value of homes at immediate risk \u2013 about 200 homes worth roughly $1 million each \u2013 plus the town\u2019s sewerage system, a caravan park and the RACV Club Resort. If the coast road is breached, the town will be cut off from Cape Paterson and the RACV resort, which is a major employer in the town, and vital infrastructure will be destroyed. The thought is overwhelming \u2013 for everyone. \u201cWe have not looked at an alternative, it\u2019s too depressing,\u201d says Allison. \u201cAt our stage of life, we\u2019re not ready for a retirement village. And I doubt whether any compensation you get back would be worth what you put in.\u201d The long view\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IPCC says coastal communities must take a long-term approach \u2013 100 years and beyond \u2013 to best respond to rising sea-water levels. It ranks beach nourishment as one of the least effective strategies \u2013 effective for around 15 years. Elevating houses keeps seas at bay for 30 years. Levees and sea walls work for about 50 and 100 years respectively. \u201cPlanned relocation\u201d is the most effective long-term solution of all. For someone who\u2019s studied his field for more than 20 years, coastal erosion expert Dr Mitchell Harley didn\u2019t start out as a beach lover. \u201cI was born and raised on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, but I wasn\u2019t your typical beach kid,\u201d says Harley. His passion for maths and science led him to a degree in environmental engineering, and later, a PhD \u2013 one that saw him driving a quad bike up and down Narrabeen beach every month for years, collecting data. \u201cIt sounded like a good gig,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I ended up studying coastlines.\u201d Coastline expert Dr Mitchell Harley wants councils to allow building only in zones that are safe from erosion. Harley is one of Australia\u2019s leading coastal researchers. He names the June 2016 East Coast low, which stripped sand from Collaroy-Narrabeen and other NSW beaches, as one of the most memorable events of his career. It was a moment that captured for him just how vulnerable Australia\u2019s built coastline is. \u201cI knew that beach [Narrabeen] like the back of my hand \u2013 and suddenly, it was unrecognisable. Just gone, overnight.\u201d Harley\u2019s research suggests that not all beaches will suffer equally. Some may look unchanged, while others could shrink rapidly or disappear altogether. In remote parts of the country, where there is little housing or infrastructure, beaches will migrate and we won\u2019t even notice. The real issue?

    "text": "It was part of a 16-minute post-match interview that effectively served as a confessional, during which he admitted he would not have been so frank in victory. He spoke similarly to fellow Australian Alex de Minaur, who revealed he was suffering from mental fatigue after his second-round defeat in Paris. Losing was what enabled players to finally realise what was going wrong, Popyrin said. \u201cMaking the second week of French Open for the first time; I didn\u2019t realise how much it takes out of, not only your physical, but mental capacity,\u201d Popyrin said. \u201cI have to not see a tennis court or a tennis racquet for a little bit. After today\u2019s match, I felt numb. I didn\u2019t feel sad, I didn\u2019t feel happy \u2013 I just felt numb, and that\u2019s not a feeling I\u2019ve ever had before.\u201d\n\nLike Popyrin, de Minaur said winning papered over the cracks of tennis players\u2019 struggles. Loading They deal with being on the road for many months each year, away from loved ones, while trying to absorb self-doubts and the pressure of a 12-month revolving rankings system with dire consequences for not matching results from a year earlier. Popyrin sits No.22 in the rankings but is 52nd in the single-season race. It is an indication of where his ranking could be headed in the months ahead as he defends more than half his points, including his historic Masters 1000 title in Canada and a fourth-round showing at the US Open, where he cut down Novak Djokovic.\n\n\u201cI need to relax and not think about the points that are coming off ... and just completely and utterly disconnect from tennis,\u201d Popyrin said. \u201cI know if I do that, I\u2019ll be able to play well again and make some results.\u201d De Minaur is workshopping a new approach with less focus on his ranking after he set and aggressively chased ambitious public goals in the past. But as defeats pile up on a tour where most weeks end that way, so do the doubts, as Kasatkina highlighted. They hurt so much more when they come in a bunch. Alexander Zverev: \u2018I feel very alone out there\u2019 There is, perhaps, less sympathy for Germany\u2019s Alexander Zverev than many others, but his surprise exit on Tuesday \u2013 amid a record-breaking tournament of ineptitude for seeded players \u2013 prompted a Popyrin-like public admission.\n\nThe world No.3 reached this year\u2019s Australian Open final and won the Munich title in his home country, but there were spotty results in between for a player of his standing. Zverev mostly fobbed off anyone who dared question his form until his Wimbledon flop. \u201cI feel very alone out there at times. I struggle mentally,\u201d Zverev said. Alexander Zverev said he was in a lonely spot at the moment. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that since after the Australian Open. I\u2019m trying to find ways to get out of this hole. I keep finding myself back in it, in a way. I feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice.\u201d Zverev, a three-time grand-slam tournament finalist who has twice fought allegations of domestic abuse, acknowledged he is now at breaking point and may seek therapy. \u201cMaybe for the first time in my life I\u2019ll probably need it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot of difficulties. I\u2019ve been through a lot of difficulties in the media. I\u2019ve been through a lot of difficulties in life generally.\u201d\n\nAryna Sabalenka: \u2018I had a therapist for five years\u2019 World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka urged Zverev to seek professional help, reflecting on her own long-term use of counselling. \u201cI had a therapist for five years in my career,\u201d she said after her win over Marie Bouzkova on Wednesday. \u201cI stopped I don\u2019t know, maybe in 2022. It\u2019s crazy to hear from someone like Alexander because he has surrounded himself with his family. World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka spoke about seeing a therapist to help her. Credit: Getty Images \u201cIt\u2019s really important to be open and to talk about what you\u2019re experiencing because if you\u2019re going to keep it inside, it\u2019s just going to destroy you. I think that\u2019s something happening to him.\u201d Madison Keys, whose Australian Open triumph in January came in her 46th grand slam, had spoken then about how therapy helped her play her best tennis and she said on Wednesday that mental health was being discussed more openly on the tours.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely got more open,\u201d Keys said. Loading \u201cI don\u2019t really remember it being a talking point much. I think more and more players are open to saying, \u2018I\u2019m talking to someone\u2019. I would say there\u2019s probably more of us that are speaking to someone now than there was before. \u201cWe have people every single week at tournaments, which is super helpful. Just to have that support, I think they\u2019ve done a really good job at really helping all of the players through what is a really tough career.\u201d There is different pressure for every player in the Wimbledon draw because grand slams bring together a cocktail of haves and have-nots.\n\nLoading Neither Sabalenka nor fellow grand slam champion Iga Swiatek has ever won the All England club title, something that would enhance their legacy. Maya Joint: \u2018Definitely going to get harder\u2019 But Sabalenka\u2019s first-round Wimbledon opponent, Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine, was driving for Uber Eats as recently as February to help fund her tennis career. Branstine\u2019s final delivery was the day before she flew to Cancun and reached her maiden WTA 125K final. The Australian who Branstine beat in the semi-finals at Cancun, 19-year-old Maya Joint, is at the beginning of her career but already understands the value of having support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sport where you\u2019re always on the road, and you\u2019re always in hotel rooms, so it can get pretty difficult,\u201d Joint said. \u201cI\u2019m really lucky with my coaches, and my mum\u2019s with me this week. I have family in Europe and family in Australia, so it\u2019s good to try and find a balance, but it\u2019s definitely going to get harder, the longer I\u2019m on tour.\u201d With Reuters For help, beyondblue1300 22 4636 Marc McGowan travelled to Wimbledon with the support of Tennis Australia",

    "text": "Since assuming control in 2021, the Australian Professional Leagues have struggled to find a working formula to convert the many millions who watch the national teams and overseas leagues, or play the game, into fans of the A-Leagues. After the collapse of the bold KeepUp experiment, the APL has been gripped by financial turmoil, with distributions to clubs falling by almost $1.5 million to just $530,000, and ongoing material concerns about the ability of some clubs to stay afloat. Johnson does not believe unbundling was a mistake, and said there are plenty of examples across world football in which healthy leagues are run independently of their national federation. Asked for his opinion on how the A-League can improve, he said the key was connecting it into global football: a strategy he said was proven by the 2015 Asian Cup and the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, and will be again by the 2026 Women\u2019s Asian Cup. \u201cThat\u2019s where there is no other sport that can compete with football, when we are hardwired in and connected to global football,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not so much about what\u2019s holding us back - it\u2019s what propels us forward. That\u2019s the space we need to continue to play. Because I think that as soon as you bring those [tournaments] back, the handbrakes are off.\n\n\u201cYou get the football community, the stakeholders, focused on the competition and the legacy that can be provided, and I think that\u2019s where we have seen our quickest growth. So I think implementing a strategy for more global competitions is something that allows the handbrakes to come off.\u201d Johnson had previously flagged FA\u2019s desire to bid for the hosting rights for the new Club World Cup, and believes that should be a high priority for the game in the coming years. Al Hilal player celebrate their shock win over Manchester City in the FIFA Club World Cup. Credit: Getty Images Despite widespread scepticism across Europe, the first edition of the rebooted tournament - currently being played in the United States - is proving a worthy addition to football\u2019s calendar, albeit with the caveat that the calendar itself is jam-packed and at risk of burning out overworked players. The next edition will be held in 2029, and potential hosts are already lining up, including Brazil, Qatar, a combined Spain-Portugal-Morocco bid, and the United States again.\n\nAn Australian bid, Johnson said, would be extremely appealing to FIFA because of its ability to reach different timezones across Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s a competition that I think will, iteration after iteration, get bigger and bigger. It would be a great competition to bring to Australia,\u201d Johnson said. Lionel Messi and the FIFA Club World Cup trophy. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThat\u2019s when I think football becomes interesting to government. Today you have the millions and millions that will watch the Socceroos and Matildas and the millions and millions that play. If the strategy is to ensure that they are watching the A-League, I think the best way to do that ... is to connect the A-League to global club competitions, whether that be the Premier League, Champions League, or the hosting of a major club competition. I think it just adds another element to the game here that we haven\u2019t seen. \u201cThe beneficiaries of the Women\u2019s World Cup were the national teams and community football. The beneficiaries of a Club World Cup would be the clubs.\u201d\n\nJohnson also said FA should not give up hope of hosting the men\u2019s World Cup, despite being railroaded out of a bid for the 2034 edition by Saudi Arabia. \u201cI believe Australia will one day host a men\u2019s World Cup. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if,\u201d he said. \u201cI think our 2010 bid was too early, and it\u2019s easy to say that in hindsight. But if you look at what we\u2019ve accomplished since then \u2026 we\u2019re steadily building a strong track record. If we continue hosting major global tournaments, even youth competitions, we\u2019ll become a country like the United States, Canada, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia - nations that are now considered \u2018normal\u2019 hosts for major events. I believe we\u2019re already on that trajectory. \u201cWe need to keep doing the work, and all of us have a responsibility to maintain the pressure and continue bringing major competitions to our region.\u201d There is another way to connect the A-Leagues to global club football: through broadcasting, another area which is unrecognisable in Australia compared to when Johnson began at FA in late 2019.\n\nOptus Sport is shutting down, having on-sold their football rights packages - headed by the Premier League - to Stan Sport, which is owned by Nine, the publishers of this masthead. That deal means that, for the first time since 2016, the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League are on the same platform again. Loading Meanwhile, the APL is currently in negotiations for a new broadcast agreement. The current contract with Network 10 and Paramount + to show the A-Leagues expires at the end of the 2025-26 season. Though Nine has shown interest, a short-term extension is expected with the incumbent rights holders - and that would lead to a situation where all of the major football rights deals in Australia, including the A-Leagues, Socceroos and Matildas, and Premier League, will all be in market at roughly the same time. \u201cThis landscape is changing rapidly, but one thing remains constant,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen you look at where the football audience is, and if we step back from just thinking about Australian football, and instead see ourselves as part of global football here in Australia - that\u2019s how I view it - you\u2019ll notice that audiences naturally gravitate toward certain properties: World Cups, the Euros, Champions League, Premier League, national team football.",

A billboard in Melbourne advertising the Kyle & Jackie O show, which has failed to attract Sydney-level audience numbers. Credit: Paul Rovere Their $200 million deal \u2013 a sum that would have left even old \u201cGolden Tonsils\u201d John Laws weak at the knees \u2013 was drawn up on the presumption that their peculiar popularity in Sydney (where they get ratings of about 16 per cent) would sweep all before them as they took their breakfast show, modestly titled Hour of Power, to the other state capitals, starting in Melbourne. Oops. The Hour of Power Sydney toilet-jokes format on KIIS caused the pair to take a colossal gutser in Melbourne from the start. A year on, their latest rating is a measly 5.1 per cent, placing the show eighth in Melbourne\u2019s breakfast slot.\n\nFor context, number one is the familiar Ross and Russ show on 3AW, where Melbourne locals Ross Stevenson and Russel Howcroft hold a mighty 20.6 per cent share of the city\u2019s breakfast audience, largely by avoiding insulting listeners\u2019 intelligence. Loading Radio 3AW is owned by Nine, which also owns The Age. Meanwhile, Australian Radio Network, which owns KIIS, is taking a mighty bath. Advertisers have fled and ARN has \u201clet go\u201d 200 employees, who must be deliriously happy to have sacrificed their jobs to keep Kyle and Jackie O in their multimillion-dollar Sydney trophy homes. It\u2019s an old story.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Fairfax media group bought Melbourne HSV7 TV station and tried to meld it into its two other channels, in Sydney and Brisbane. It failed spectacularly because Melbourne audiences saw it, quite correctly, as a Sydney try-on. Soon after, Fairfax, having lost several millions of dollars on its Melbourne bet, sold its TV interests to dodgy Christopher Skase\u2019s Qintex Group. Skase later went bankrupt and fled Australia. Sydney shock jocks Stan Zemanek and Alan Jones both tried and failed to transfer their loudmouthed fame to Melbourne. Southern audiences just never warmed to Jones\u2019 dreadful braying, and the late Zemanek\u2019s flashiness lasted only a year on 3AW. Not all black and white for Paul Keating. Credit: Photographic Paul Keating earned scorn when, trying to broaden his appeal while launching his campaign to topple Bob Hawke as PM, he flew himself and several reporters to Melbourne to barrack for Collingwood at the MCG. No one was fooled that he had any serious interest in the Australian game, let alone Collingwood.\n\nKeating was also famed for his reported view that, \u201cIf you\u2019re not living in Sydney, you\u2019re just camping out.\u201d Even he knew it wouldn\u2019t fly among southern voters, and strategically disowned the comment during a visit to Melbourne in the lead-up to the 1996 election. Asked about the \u201ccamping out\u201d observation by broadcasters Dean Banks and Ross Stevenson on 3AW in October 1995, Keating declared: \u201cNo, somebody falsely attributed those words to me. I love Melbourne, the garden city of Australia.\u201d Six months later, Keating and his government were booted out and he retired to his beloved Sydney. Even Sydney\u2019s criminal milieu could not cut it in Melbourne. My colleague John Silvester relates the amusing story of Sydney crook Stan \u201cThe Man\u201d Smith\u2019s abortive attempt to expand his criminal pursuits into Melbourne decades ago.\n\nLoading \u201cWhen he arrived at Tullamarine airport, waiting police miraculously found a matchbox full of hashish in the top outside jacket pocket \u2013 usually only used to display a decorative handkerchief,\u201d Silvester wrote. \u201cSmith is said to have cried out, \u2018I\u2019m being fitted up\u2019, no doubt a reference to his dapper, tailor-made suit. When he returned home (after serving one year), he vowed to never return to Melbourne because \u2018the cops run red-hot down there\u2019.\u201d The fact that Melburnians have rarely bought Sydneysiders\u2019 pretensions was long attributed to Melbourne wearing a chip on its shoulder because Sydney was the first city established in Australia, and was blessed with greater natural beauty. A friend has a more nuanced view.\n\nMelbourne, she proposes, has always had to try harder to build itself a beating heart because it was not blessed with Sydney\u2019s astonishing natural loveliness. How could Melbourne and its Yarra and its tame bay compete with Sydney\u2019s glorious ocean beaches, the great sweep of its harbour, its cliffs and river gorges and the Blue Mountains hovering away to the west? The answer, of course, was to get serious and accomplished. About food, conversation, architecture, education and sport, for starters. Sydneysiders could afford to play in the sun and the surf and merrily flaunt their wealth. Melburnians hunkered beneath often leaden skies and worked at building a relatively sophisticated, relatively civil society, replete with marvellous restaurants and the nation\u2019s oldest and most visited art gallery, named (immodestly) the National Gallery of Victoria.",

You don\u2019t necessarily \u2013 particularly when it\u2019s the first time [of diagnosis] \u2013 appreciate how much impact it is going to have.\n\n\u201cYou have to find your new normal and that takes time \u2026 and it\u2019s a rollercoaster, it\u2019s not one smooth plane, which you expect it to be. But the reality is it\u2019s not, you go through hard times. \u201cAnd to have a place like this to have the support network, through creativity and singing or gardening, whatever it might be, is so valuable and it\u2019s great this community has it. \u201cIt would be great if lots of communities had this kind of support.\u201d Speaking to patients, including those whose cancer had returned and one who had lost his husband to cancer, the princess asked how the centre had helped them.\n\n\u201cThat first-time diagnosis is a very scary journey,\u201d she said, referring to the benefits of having an on-site hospital support network where many volunteers have had cancer themselves and survived. Many newly diagnosed patients at Colchester Hospital now visit the centre immediately for counselling and advice. Loading \u201cTo feel a sense of hope and positivity [from speaking to people who have already been through it] is such a positive thing in what is otherwise a very scary and daunting experience,\u201d the princess said. She added that \u201cscience has told us that the mind, body and spirit experience is so important\u201d, asking if the hospital\u2019s clinical team gave any feedback about how the wellness centre had affected patients. After around an hour at the centre, Princess Catherine moved into the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Wellbeing Garden at Colchester Hospital, where she helped plant roses named after her.\n\nGetting her hands dirty and asking if she could do a bit more work, the princess dug alongside Adam Frost, the television garden designer, telling him she was feeling \u201cgood\u201d and pleased to be able to work outside. In the pouring rain, as the engagement overran by about 30 minutes, she told hospital staff and patients who had waited outside to see her: \u201cI\u2019m just washing my hands \u2013 I\u2019ll be back.\u201d The Princess of Wales literally got her hands dirty planting roses in the wellbeing garden. The visit coincides with the donation of 50 Catherine\u2019s Roses, named in her honour.

Kensington Palace said the princess was there to \u201ccelebrate the incredible healing power of nature and raise awareness of the important role that spending time in nature plays in bringing us joy and supporting our mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing\u201d.\n\nLoading The princess arrived at Colchester Hospital with little fanfare, walking through the public garden as one mother told her little girl: \u201cThat\u2019s a real-life princess, there!\u201d Meeting staff inside, the princess praised the hospital\u2019s continuity of care and the network of volunteers, which saw former patients returning to help others. \u201cIt must make a difference to people coming in here, in knowing there are people who have been through it too,\u201d she said. \u201cEven through the hard times and loss, there is a sense of hope and community through a space like this.\u201d \u201cFrom personal experience,\u201d the princess added, holistic support during recovery \u201cwas that lifeline you need post-treatment, when you\u2019re not receiving continuous care\u201d.\n\n\u2018A mind, body and spirit perspective\u2019 The centre includes support groups as well as massage, reflexology, a family practitioner, advice on wig fittings, and a \u201ccancer choir\u201d. The Princess of Wales posed with staff during her visit. She praised the continuity of care the hospital provided. Credit: Getty Images \u201cIt\u2019s looking at treatment and recovery as complementary,\u201d the princess said. \u201cLooking at it from a mind, body and spirit perspective really matters. It\u2019s great, well done.\u201d \u201cHaving gone through it myself,\u201d she added, she could now better understand the challenges of finding support.\n\nLoading \u201cSome people don\u2019t have access and don\u2019t necessarily know how this system can help them,\u201d she said. \u201cJoining the dots for patients and families \u2026 while there might be fantastic community work going on, if it\u2019s bitty and there isn\u2019t one place and one body bringing these support networks together, it\u2019s hard to reach out, particularly when you\u2019re vulnerable. I can see it has such a transformative effect.\u201d Hearing about the centre\u2019s choir, the princess added: \u201cHaving these creative avenues is really fantastic.\u201d Princess Catherine carried a mug of tea as she spoke to patients and volunteers, joking that \u201cas a parent, you know you\u2019ll keep losing your cup of tea\u201d otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the patients, it\u2019s the family too,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the cancer care, treatment, healing, it\u2019s about the whole person \u2013 mind, body and spirit. We know now that all those three dimensions matter to the recovery journey.\u201d\n\nThe wellbeing garden at Colchester Hospital, which opened in July 2024, is intended to be a \u201crelaxing and restorative space for NHS staff, patients and visitors\u201d and hosts activities for those in or visiting the hospital. The garden is taking part in research for the RHS\u2019s Blueprint for Wellbeing Gardens, which will launch in spring next year. The visit came with a donation of 50 Catherine\u2019s Rose plants, named for the princess by the RHS, with funds from sales going to the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. A total of 500 Catherine\u2019s Rose plants will be donated to well-being and community gardens across the UK this summer, including Maggie\u2019s gardens for people affected by cancer, East Anglia\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospices and Horatio\u2019s Gardens for those living with spinal injuries. Meanwhile, Queen Camilla has hailed the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Maggie\u2019s cancer care centres while on a visit in Kirkcaldy, Scotland.\n\nThe Queen, 77, is president of Maggie\u2019s and spent the morning visiting one of its 24 centres while her daughter-in-law spoke candidly about her \u201crollercoaster\u201d experience after cancer treatment. During the visit, Camilla spoke about the \u201cbrilliant\u201d care that Maggie\u2019s centres offered cancer patients and their families, adding that \u201cthere is something so special about them\u201d. Queen Camilla visiting Maggie\u2019s in Scotland. Credit: Getty Images The Queen also met with the charity\u2019s founder and chief executive, Dame Laura Lee. Speaking afterwards, Dame Laura said: \u201cIt is always a joy to welcome her majesty to one of our centres, especially one she has never been to before. \u201cAs always, she was incredibly generous with her time and listened closely to our centre visitors as they shared their stories. We are so grateful for her continued support.\u201d\n\nLoading As part of the engagement, Camilla also met people living with cancer, similarly to her husband, the King, who is receiving ongoing treatment. Maggie\u2019s provides free psychological, emotional and practical support for anyone living with the disease, as well as their family and friends. The Queen was also greeted on Wednesday by Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, and Kirsty Wark, who are honorary patrons of the charity. The Telegraph, London",

    "text": "Peanut butter, Jatz crackers, Arnott's Shapes and instant noodles are just some of the items left in easy reach of hungry dingoes.\n\nPhotographs taken on the sandy beaches of one of Australia\u2019s most popular holiday spots reveal a dangerous camping problem that\u2019s putting tourists at risk. Taken during 2024 and 2025, by Queensland rangers, they show several tents ransacked by dingoes searching for food.\n\nIn one image, boxes of Jatz crackers, Arnott's Shapes and Assorted Creams, and an open tub of margarine can be seen strewn across the ground. Another taken inside a tent shows food spread across the floor and instant noodles and other snacks in easy reach of dingoes.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t being caused by the animals themselves, which are native to K\u2019gari and natural scavengers. They\u2019re being accidentally lured into tents because campers are failing to properly secure their food.\n\nDingoes are opportunistic feeders that can lose their fear of humans.

Source: DETSI\n\nThe Department of Environment and Tourism\u2019s Dr Linda Behrendorff explained dingoes are \u201copportunistic by nature\u201d and will tear open tents, break eskies open and knock over bins in search of an easy meal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWildlife scavenging around camping areas is a common occurrence, and the problem with leaving food or rubbish where dingoes or other wildlife can get it makes them less fearful of humans,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDingoes don\u2019t differentiate between food and rubbish, and they can start approaching people for food which puts dingoes and people at risk.\u201d\n\nCommon dingo myth busted\n\nOnce dingoes lose their fear of humans, they can become a danger. And sadly if they attack and are considered a danger, this can result in the animals being euthanised.\n\nBehrendorff has dispelled the myth that food was inaccessible in fenced camping areas, and said it needed to be kept in strong boxes inside a vehicle cabin or on the back of a ute.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA tent or annexe is not a secure place, and dingoes have also taken people\u2019s belongings such as clothing, toiletries or shoes that carry the smell of food,\u201d she added.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",
