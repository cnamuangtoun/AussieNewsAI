(Graphic: Polly Hanning)\n\nMilly Rose Bannister, founder of youth mental health charity ALLKND , is devastated but unsurprised by the data.\n\n\"For a young person to reach the point of asking for help takes a lot of courage and then being told to wait three or four months can feel like being told you don't matter,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"In a world where so many teens already feel unseen, unheard, or overwhelmed, that wait time can be the tipping point.\"\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nThe study \ufeffwas based on based on a survey of 375 Australians aged between 13 and 17.\n\nIt found that teen participants who initiated care with psychiatrists waited an average of 127.5 days, the longest wait time of any provider.\n\nThose seeking support from psychologists waited an average of 100.1 days, while the average wait time for paediatricians was 121.9 days, and the wait for national youth mental health foundation Headspace was 107.6 days.\n\nLong wait times can be attributed, in part, to a shortage of key providers like psychiatrists and higher demand for mental health support among young people. \ufeff\n\n\"We hear stories from young people who've waited months for a first appointment, been turned away, or given referrals to services they can't afford or even get to,\" Bannister said.\n\n\"Some say they've just stopped trying [...] because the system feels impossible to navigate, especially when you're already struggling.\"\n\nMost teen participants did not receive support from healthcare providers during that wait time and reported that their mental health worsened while waiting.\n\nLonger wait times were associated with \ufeffincreased psychological distress, with more than two-thirds of participants reporting that feelings of sadness worsened while waiting.\n\nMany also \ufeffreported engaging in unhealthy coping behaviours while waiting for care.\n\nMore than 92 per cent of participants reported engaging in maladaptive coping behaviours like spending more time alone, sleeping, or scrolling social media.\n\nA further 75 per cent reported engaging in risky behaviours such as \ufeffself-harming, skipping school, drinking alcohol, vaping and smoking.\n\nLong wait times can also lead to teens not attending treatment when the time finally comes.\n\nMore than half of the 14.7 per cent of participants \ufeffwho reported that they were likely to attend their first treatment session said it was because \"the wait time was too long\".\n\nThere were some positives, like the fact that almost nine in 10 participants employed help-seeking\ufeff behaviours while waiting for care, such as looking up mental health information online.\n\nBut overall \ufeffthe research highlighted the urgent need for systemic reform in the delivery of youth mental health services according to Professor Bridianne O'Dea, one of the lead researchers.\n\n\"We are now in the midst of a crisis where the demand for youth mental health care has increased rapidly in the past two decades,\" she said, via Scimex .\n\n\"The first line of treatment is psychological therapy. There is a huge demand for it and we do not have the number of clinicians required to meet that demand.\"\n\nYoung people who took part in the study called for better communication and \ufeffregular check-ins from service providers to help address the burden of waiting for care.\n\nO'Dea called for the introduction of evidence-based, government-backed national wait time benchmarks to help reduce how long Australian teens wait for critical support.\n\n\"Everyone needs someone safe to talk to,\" Bannister said. (Instagram/@millyrosebannister)\n\n\"We don't accept delayed response times for physical injuries, so why do we still tolerate it for mental health?\" Bannister said.\n\nThrough ALLKND, she advocates for early intervention and funding towards \ufeffyouth-specific mental health services and community-based, integrated care including peer workers, school programs, and youth-led initiatives.\n\n\"Everyone needs someone safe to talk to. If we can lighten the load at the crisis end, the whole system becomes more sustainable,\" she said.\n\nWhile the 2025-26 federal budget released this week promised to inject billions into Australia's healthcare system, Black Dog Institute reported that the mental health sector remains critically underfunded.\n\nThe budget included an \ufeff$8.4 billion investment over four years to boost bulk billing for GP appointments, which are usually the first port of call for young people seeking mental health treatment.\n\nMore than $784 million will go towards capping PBS medication costs over the next four years, including mental health medications.\n\nA further $46 million will go towards delivering free digital mental health tools over four years, which young Australians are already looking to for support during wait times.\n\nWATCH: Chris Kohler's two-minute guide to the 2025 federal budget\ufeff\n\nBannister says that while the figures sound promising, the current budget measures will have a limited impact on the youth mental health crisis.\n\n\"This is a national emergency and we cannot solve it with small-scale, long-term gestures,\" she said.\n\nWithout long-term investment into accessible services, youth mental health literacy programs, and culturally safe care for marginalised youth, Bannister fears young Australians struggling with mental health will continue to fall through the cracks.\n\n\ufeff\"Mental health support needs to meet young people where they are, not ask them to climb mountains to access it.\"\n\nReaders seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.

    "text": "When many of us think of Indian food, we think of curry.\n\nABC Every Bite Every Bite tells a story \u2013 the stories behind the food we love to eat.\n\nThat saucy and aromatic blend of spices, meat, and vegetables, often slow-cooked and served with rice and traditional naan bread or roti.\n\nBut, surprisingly, the word curry doesn't originate from India.\n\nOut of all the major pre-colonial languages spoken in India, none of them contain the word curry.\n\nSo, how did the dish become the poster child of authentic Indian cuisine?\n\nCurry's origin story\n\nPortuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reached Calicut on the Malabar Coast in 1498.\n\nIt was the beginning of the European and British presence in India that would eventually change the subcontinent in multiple ways, including shaping how we view Indian cuisine today.\n\n\"When you really dig deep, nobody really knows where [the word] curry comes from,\" Lizzie Collingham, a researcher and author, tells ABC Radio National's Every Bite.\n\nMelbourne chef Helly Raichura cooks traditional regional Indian food. (ABC Radio National: Damien Peck )\n\nDr Collingham says the arrival of the Portuguese is the earliest record of the word curry being applied to Indian dishes.\n\nWith the arrival of European and British settlers in India, mainly around Goa and Cochin (now Kochi), the word curry became a way to refer to what Indian people were eating.\n\n\"Curry was a word the Portuguese used and then when the British picked it up \u2026 That's what they called any dish that an Indian [person] ate,\" Dr Collingham says.\n\nBut it wasn't what Indian people called their food.\n\nThe colonisation of India's cuisine\n\nOver time Indian dishes, like many other traditional cuisines around the world, have evolved through colonisation and migration.\n\nMany of the ingredients thought of as staples of Indian food, including curry, were historically introduced to the subcontinent, often by a colonial presence or changes within society.\n\nLizzie Collingham says the history of the word \"curry\" is complicated. (Penguin Books: Terry Roopnaraine)\n\nFor example, when the Portuguese arrived in Goa, India, they found that the Brahmins (priests who belonged to the highest Hindu hereditary class) didn't eat onion and garlic for spiritual reasons.\n\n\"Brahmins wouldn't have used onion and garlic because they were considered rather heating and dangerous foods for spiritual people,\" Dr Collingham says.\n\n\"But the ruling classes would eat quite a lot of it, and meat, and put a lot of spices in.\"\n\nAnd chillies? They didn't exist in India until the Portuguese settlers brought them to Goa and Cochin from the Americas.\n\nIn fact, it was black and long pepper that were used by Indian people during that period to add heat to their food.\n\nThe exchange of spices and regional ingredients was part of the reason why the Portuguese had a presence in India, Dr Collingham explains.\n\nAn ingredient synonymous with Indian food, chillies were actually introduced by European settlers from the Americas. (Supplied: Hardie Grant Publishing)\n\n\"Cardamoms grow in the hills in what's now Kerala above Cochin. And you've got spices being brought in like nutmeg and cloves \u2026 So, all those spices would have been plentifully used in Indian food in that period,\" she says.\n\nAnd so in Goa, during this time, dishes that we now associate with the term \"curry\" began to emerge.\n\nThe British touch\n\nOver a long period, the British presence in India increased. Eventually, it transitioned into political and military dominance over a large part of the country.\n\nStream your favourite shows on the free ABC listen app Photo shows Image of Dr Karl on a pink background and Listen app logo Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks \u2026 and you don't need to be a scientist to find it!\n\nThe British had Indian cooks working for them, and these workers would adapt their food to suit their customers.\n\n\"It was too spicy and too difficult for the English to digest \u2026 So they adapted their dishes to meet British tastes,\" Dr Collingham says.\n\nThe British enjoyed these dishes and tried to replicate them back in Britain, but they found being authentic to the process was too labour-intensive.\n\nCurry is symbolic of Indian food, but its affiliation is complicated for many. (ABC News: David Sier)\n\n\"They [the British] have this awful way of whatever they touch, they tend to homogenise,\" she says.\n\nAnd soon curry powder came to be. It was an entirely British invention.\n\n\" So they fry some onions, they dump in some curry powder, they dump in some meat and water, and they stew it \u2026 And that's what the British call curry. \"\n\nTrue to home\n\nAuthentic Indian cuisine is based on seasonal produce specific to the regions. And it's traditionally reflective of the classes Indian people belong to.\n\nChef Helly Raichura, who owns the Melbourne Indian restaurant, Enter via Laundry, says adapting to changing seasonal and historical environments is a feature of Indian cuisine.\n\nSpices were a hot trade item for many years. (ABC: Damien Peck)\n\n\"Evolution is the only constant in Indian food because it has changed so much,\" she says.\n\nMs Raichura avoids cooking stereotypical Indian cuisine in her restaurant.\n\nInstead, she relies on the foundations of what was passed down through her family to cook what she believes is an authentic Indian regional menu.\n\n\"They [her ancestors] were very much connected to the land. They were very much connected to where they were and taking and using things that were seasonal for them,\" she says.\n\nChef Helly Raichura says using in-season ingredients is key. (ABC: Damien Peck )\n\nWhen Ms Raichura arrived in Australia, she was surprised to see seasonal produce wasn't prioritised in the same way it is in India.\n\n\"It was very shocking to me to see very bad quality tomatoes that you can still buy in winter \u2026 I was like, just don't sell it,\" she says.\n\nMs Raichura believes India's strong relationship with seasonal food enhances the eating experience.\n\n\"There are rituals and recipes at specific times of the year that are cherished,\" she says.\n\n\"You're not getting strawberries in winter, you're waiting for it. There's an anticipation.\"\n\nThe intersection of curry and identity\n\nWe've often heard Italians baulk at the Westernised state of Italian cuisine \u2014 particularly pizza.\n\nAnd the same thing can be said for many traditional cuisines around the world including Japanese, Thai and Mexican.\n\nSo it's little wonder that many Indians have struggled with associating curry as a symbol of authentic Indian cuisine.\n\nHelly Richura says Indian food is constantly evolving. (ABC Radio National: Damien Peck )\n\n\"I think there are a lot of layers to what Indian food is and layers of history and then when you put it down to just the C word [curry] \u2026 you know?\" Ms Raichura says.\n\n\"For the longest time ever, no self-respecting Indian said, \u2018I'm going to have a curry tonight' \u2026 That wasn't in the vocabulary,\" Dr Collingham says.\n\nUnderstanding the history of their cuisine, and how it shapes their identity today is sometimes a complex task for Indians, Canadian author Naben Ruthnum adds.\n\n\"I'm a postcolonial mess of a person over here who's scraped together an identity that has very little to do with my country of origin.\"\n\nAnd today, for many Indians all over the world, curry has taken on a different meaning, despite its ambiguous and colonial origins.\n\n\"To me, it's come to sort of represent a blend of identities,\" Ruthnum says.\n\nDespite being a colonial invention, some Indians have learned to embrace the word curry and reclaim the dish as symbolic of their complex history, he explains.\n\n\"It's come to represent a food that I really like, and it's come to represent all the things that I didn't really understand about history and myself.\"",

(ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nMs Starr has used an Advanced Health Directive, a legal document setting out a person's healthcare wishes for when they can no longer make them, to request access to VAD after two years of living with dementia.\n\nShe knows it would currently be illegal for any healthcare professional to follow through on this request, but wanted it recorded anyway.\n\n\"My first port of call was to say to my doctor \u2026 'Can you just put it in your record that if I'm diagnosed with dementia, I want to access Voluntary Assisted Dying?',\" she said.\n\n\"And he said, 'I can't do that because it's not legal'.\n\n\" And I said, 'I realise that but in the future it may be'. \"\n\nDementia Australia said the illness was on track to become the country's leading cause of death and currently affects an estimated 433,300 Australians.\n\nMs Starr is among those urging state governments to at least discuss the possibility of broadening VAD laws to include dementia in the future.\n\nBut recent reviews of WA and Victoria's laws barely touched on the subject.\n\nMs Starr hopes eligibility laws for VAD will expand in the future. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nDementia debate\n\nDying with Dignity WA president Steve Walker has long urged the state government to consider expanding VAD laws to people with dementia through an Advanced Health Directive.\n\nHe was disappointed the idea was not considered during a statutory review of WA's laws last year, particularly as other countries now allow it.\n\n\"The government in effect, they shutdown any discussion on this,\" he said.\n\nWA Health Minister Meredith Hammat said the review was never about changing the scope of current laws, only assessing whether they were working as intended.\n\nShe said it was vital people accessing VAD could provide informed consent throughout the entire process.\n\nAustralian Medical Association's ethics and medico legal committee chair Kerrie Aust is a big believer in broader public debate about VAD.\n\nCanberra GP Dr Kerrie Aust does not support expanding VAD laws for people with dementia. (Supplied: Ainsley Fisher)\n\nBut she did not currently support opening access to those with dementia.\n\n\"My personal view is that we don't have sufficient processes in place to have dementia included as part of an Advanced Care Directive,\" she said.\n\n\"Where my hesitation comes in is because you often don't know what your future self would want.\n\n\"Dementia is a very broad spectrum, and I think an assumption that all people with dementia are suffering and unhappy is not the experience of the majority of our geriatricians.\"\n\nShe said it was certainly worth monitoring the success of models used overseas and evaluating their data to see the potential risks and benefits in the future.\n\nMore than law change required\n\nSouth Australia-based wills and estates lawyer Nikki Owen said a person who requests VAD through an Advanced Health Directive today would be very unlikely to ever access it, even if laws around dementia were to change.\n\nNikki Owen says strict rules limit access to VAD for people with dementia in countries where it is legal. (Supplied: Mellor Olsson Lawyers)\n\nAcross the handful of countries where people with dementia can access VAD, strict parameters are in place.\n\nIn Canada's Quebec, for example, the request to access VAD must be formalised after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's but before losing the ability to make informed decisions.\n\nMs Owen believed if any Australian states were to permit VAD for people with dementia in the future, it would be with similarly strict conditions and the Advanced Health Directive would need to be formulated after the law came in.\n\nBut she said she had come across those determined to include it.\n\n\"I've come across one or two and I've explained to them that it's not legally binding,\" she said.\n\n\"[But] there's no harm in it.\n\n\"As long as you just expressed the wish and you say in there that you understand it at the moment, it's not something that you can bind anybody to do.\"\n\nMs Starr believes there was value in having her views formalised.",

Residents are also asked to rank whether affordability, accessibility, frequency, or proximity is most important when considering public transport options.\n\nMr Bleijie said southern Gold Coast residents' submissions would be prioritised over others and that he was open to all modes of transport.\n\n\"Those residents in the southern Gold Coast will be obviously taken into more consideration because that's who we have committed this promise to,\" he said.\n\nThe LNP government promised to review the project ahead of last year's state election.\n\n\"We promised we'd listen to them and take their feedback on board. We all know the Labor party already had made up their mind [on the project],\" Mr Bleijie said.\n\nSupport for reviews\n\nReal estate developer Steven Harrison, who leads the business advisory that advocates for the project, said he welcomed the new consultation process.\n\nBut he said he was concerned about discussion again about different transport modes, adding that buses were not as efficient as the light rail which has been used by about 92 million passengers since the Gold Coast line opened.\n\nThe light rail in Nerang on the Gold Coast.

(ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nThey had no idea what that meant and were emotionally exhausted.\n\nNow, three months on, their close friend Mitch McKenny is gearing up to run across New South Wales, from Broken Hill to Newcastle \u2014 the equivalent of 27 marathons in 27 days \u2014 raising money for research into the condition.\n\n'He was perfect'\n\nBree and Jess Maguire were elated when they found out they were expecting a baby boy.\n\n\"We were just so excited and happy,\" Jess said.\n\n\"In a household filled with girls [we were excited] to have a boy,\" Bree agreed.\n\nThe days leading up to Huxley's birth were filled with nervous anticipation, but when he arrived all nerves were pushed aside.\n\n\"He was born and he was perfect,\" Jess said.\n\nBree (left) and Huxley had to fly to Adelaide with the Royal Flying Doctor Service twice during emergencies. (Supplied)\n\n\"He struggled with some breathing but nothing too dramatic. We thought he was OK,\" she said.\n\nThe pair took Huxley home and it soon became clear something was wrong.\n\nHe was not feeding and he was often screaming.\n\nThe couple brought him back to Broken Hill Base Hospital, distressed that their child might be in pain.\n\n\u201cOver the course of their investigations, they found he had reflux of the bladder and kidney, which was causing UTIs, so he was consistently getting infections,\u201d Jess said.\n\nIt was the first step in a four-month journey to a diagnosis that ended in their paediatrician's office in Broken Hill.\n\nHuxley is the pair's second IVF baby after Sage, 3. Bree also has an older child, Asha, 14. (ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nThe paediatrician explained the complex syndrome would likely mean Huxley would never walk or talk and would need constant care for the rest of his life.\n\nJess remembers feeling \"numb\".\n\n\"Our perfect little boy, here he was sitting there and it was like they took his life away from us. But he was physically right there,\" she said.\n\nHope on the horizon\n\nWhen the couple got home they searched the web to understand Angelman syndrome.\n\nOne of the groups they learnt about was FAST, the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics Australia.\n\nMeagan Cross is the chief executive of FAST, whose daughter, Molly, has Angelman syndrome. (Supplied: Meagan Cross)\n\nFAST chief executive Meagan Cross's daughter Molly is 18 and has the syndrome.\n\n\"It affects a single gene and it only affects the mother's copy of it,\" she said.\n\n\"It causes a complex disability that affects nearly all the aspects of life \u2014 gross motor, fine motor, delays in walking and sitting.\"\n\nMs Cross said the foundation was focused on research while offering support to parents and carers of children with Angelman syndrome.\n\n\"The hole in your heart will always be there,\" she said.\n\n\"Something has happened to your child; sometimes it's not as raw, but sometimes it can be really raw, [but] there's a lot of hope for the future.\"\n\nProfessor David Armor is a clinical geneticist at Melbourne University and part of the team involved in an international trial of treatment for Angelman syndrome at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital.\n\nHe says the trial investigates turning on the silenced paternal copy of a gene.\n\n\"Kids with Angelman syndrome have one copy from the father, which is silenced in the body, and there are trials underway to switch on that paternal copy which, at least in theory, should be able to fulfil the same role as the maternal copy,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Amor says a diagnosis of Angelman syndrome is usually made between the ages of two and three years old. (ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nProfessor Armor explained that the trial involved injections every three months.\n\n\"Using a specific treatment to activate the parental copy, it's pretty complicated and involves the child having injections into fluid around the spinal cord and the brain every three months or so,\" he said.\n\n\"At the moment we don't have results to this trial, so we don't know if it's going to be proved to be effective or not,\".\n\nEven so, Professor Armor said the future was looking bright.\n\n\"There's a lot more optimism now than there has been that we might be able to decrease the severity of symptoms,\" he said.\n\n'I won't let that answer be nothing'\n\nA friend of the Maguires, Mitch McKenny, remembers hearing about Huxley's diagnosis and instantly Googling.\n\nHis young son attends Jess's family daycare and he felt indebted to her.\n\n\"My young fella, my toddler, goes to daycare with Jessie and as a result of that has grown tremendously and has benefited from some outstanding care from them,\" he said.\n\n\"When it became clear that young Huxley was unwell, I felt [the need] to pay it forward in a sense.\"\n\nMitch will start his run on August 22, Huxley's first birthday. (ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nAfter talking to Meagan, he decided to undertake the run not just to raise money but also spread awareness of Angelman syndrome.\n\nHe hopes the campaign, named \"Huxley's Heroes\" will help treatments become available in Australian homes.\n\nSo far, the campaign has raised around $40,000 with local clubs and pubs, sporting groups and individuals donating.\n\nMr McKenny feels the more-than-1,000km run is an apt dedication to those with the disorder.\n\n\"After I got permission from my wife, I decided that it had to be a physical challenge because these kids and their mums and dads are physically challenged every day,\" he said.\n\nMr McKenny starts the run on August 22, Huxley's first birthday.\n\n\"One day, when [my son] is older he'll ask me what I did for his mate Huxley and I won't let that answer be 'nothing',\" he said.",

That is what is at stake in this election.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nLeader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, says Australians cannot afford to continue under a Labor government.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has criticised the Albanese government\u2019s approach to cost-of-living relief, telling Channel Seven that he will provide immediate cost-of-living measures if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got to help people in the short term, because over the last 12 months, we've just had the biggest number of small businesses that have failed in our country's history, and a lot of families are really doing it tough. So we need to provide support in the short term. And the Prime Minister's saying, well, in 15 months time, he'll give you 70 cents a day in a tax cut. Our plan is to provide a 25 cent a litre reduction in petrol and diesel and unleaded prices. Now that's going to be about $14 a week straight away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Dutton says that will be followed by structural reforms that include the Coalition's gas reservation plan on the East Coast which he says will bring electricity prices down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition Leader has told reporters that before the election he will reveal which visa categories the Coalition would target to cut permanent migration by 25 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to a question from SBS about whether he is alienating migrant voters he said, 'there are many migrant families I've spoken to around the country who are desperately worried for their kids' as they can't afford to buy a house'.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that 'so many from all parts of our society are experiencing exactly the same as everyone else, and that is that it's tougher to find a house under this government'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nRural communities in northern Western Australia are being warned to prepare for days of isolation after Tropical Cyclone Dianne made landfall early this morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristie Johnson with the Bureau of Meteorology says the category one system crossed the coast east of Cockatoo Island and is expected to weaken within hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s moving south and is forecast to pass east of Derby around midday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're talking winds up to a hundred kilometres an hour now that's enough to bring down trees and lines and cause damage to properties. We're also talking about heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding. R rainfall totals of 70 to a 100 millimetres over a six hour period, maybe even up to a hundred and fifty millimetres in that period. Now we are expecting the system to move inland and rapidly weaken back into a low pressure system, it's likely to continue to move southwards through Saturday, and then on Sunday tend more south to south. Easterly as it moves into the interior of Western Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFlash flooding is likely across northern and western Kimberley, and heavy rainfall could extend into the northern interior over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in tennis,\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian-born tennis star Daria Kasatkina is switching allegiances to Australia after her application for permanent residency was accepted by the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world number 12 has been playing on the tour as a neutral athlete after Russian and Belarusian players were banned from competing under their own flags following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\n\n",

So having that cake and everyone enjoying it at the same time is a wonderful blessing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Andar is self-taught and spends many hours decorating each cake.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith food prices rising she says quality ingredients aren\u2019t cheap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I try and keep the prices low because I am a home baker. I do it out of love. It's not so much for economic gains, but it's my passion, it's my hobby.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Andar is married and raising two children in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile her cakes may be sweet, she remains bitter about the plight of girls in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the three years since the Taliban cut secondary education for women, UNICEF estimates 2.2 million girls have been impacted and by 2030, more than four million girls will have their education stopped at primary school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is very um, sad. It's really disheartening to see the women or the girls that had to leave their education half finished. Maybe they will not be able to live the dream that they had of becoming a doctor, for example, or a lawyer. I'm constantly seeing footages of girls crying and they can't finish their studies or they're struggling financially. The women where they have no male guardian, so how are they supposed to support their family?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one reason Ms Andar secretly supports online education for girls in her homeland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are very kind people out there that are trying to help them. And of course my husband and I try to do our bit to support wherever possible. Some kind of education. It could be something as simple as learning English.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is decades since Ms Andar and her family fled conflict in Afghanistan, escaping overland on donkeys into neighbouring Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the memories of growing up in Kabul remain vivid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The skies being light up and me thinking that it's fireworks where it was actually conflict going on. And the loud bangs, it wasn't fireworks \u2026 so that's something scary.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney academic Parisa Glass also fled conflict in her homeland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember being very young in Iran and having men surrounding our home, chanting that they want to kill my father and other Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in the community. It feels like the gates of hell opened.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt New South Wales University, Dr Glass runs a justice inclusion initiative called JEINA [[Jina]] which creates pathways for displaced women.\n\n\n\n\n\nJEINA is a Kurdish word meaning life-giver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It started in 2022 as a result of the uprising of women in Iran for their rights because Jina Mahsa Amini was incarcerated and she died in custody because of the choices of her clothing. And we don't want that to happen any more. So, it's really about justice for women wherever they may be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide, this year almost 140 million people are displaced or stateless, according to the UNHCR.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Glass is working to improve outcomes for those seeking safety here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Forced migration happens for many reasons. And it could be war, it could be human rights violation, it could be climate change. It's a big barrier for them to actually be able to find employment and obviously other issues associated with that. Domestic violence is a big issue as well as mental health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJEINA has so far broadened opportunities for hundreds of women and Dr Glass hopes to scale further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got a massive mentoring network at UNSW. We want these women to take advantage of that and we want industry to partner with us so we can build a much bigger network.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Ramadan fasting comes to an end, Narges Andar hopes all women can find reasons celebrate and count their blessings.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "With the cost of living still biting, the Coalition says it will lower petrol prices if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has proposed halving the fuel excise for 12 months \u2014 dropping it from 50.8 cents a litre to 25.4 cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure is expected to cost $6 billion if it goes ahead, and is touted to deliver taxpayers a saving of $14 per week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in a global context, are Australians really paying too much at the bowser \u2014 and would cutting taxes on petrol actually help ease the pressure?\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition pours petrol on the cost of living debate ahead of the election\n\nWhere Australian petrol prices sit on the global stage\n\nWhile it might feel like your bank account is being drained every time you fill up, Australians actually pay less per litre than many other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to GlobalPetrolPrices.com, the average cost of petrol in Australia is $1.65 per litre \u2014 well below the global average of nearly $2 per litre.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the average is $2.79, while European countries such as Iceland ($3.70), the Netherlands ($3.25) and Italy ($3.04) fork out almost double Australia's rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the United States averages just under Australia at $1.45, with Vietnam ($1.27), Indonesia ($1.32) and Malaysia ($0.73) coming in even lower.\n\n\n\nWhile Australians may feel the pinch every time they fill up, petrol prices in Australia are lower than those in many other countries. Source: SBS News So, are we getting taxed more than other countries?\n\n\n\n\n\nYogi Vidyattama, an associate professor at the University of Canberra's School of Politics, Economics and Society, says Australians are \"in the middle\" when it comes to fuel taxes globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In general and in the world context, the base price is quite similar,\" he says of petrol prices around the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is more expensive than the US, but it's lower than European countries because of that high excise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the European Union, for example, each member state is required to levy a minimum of \u20ac0.36 (61c) per litre on petrol and \u20ac0.33 (56c) on diesel.\n\n\n\nAustralia fares comparatively well when it comes to fuel excises. Source: SBS News John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, says relatively lower taxes are one reason we pay less at the bowser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia has lower fuel taxes than most OECD countries,\" he told SBS News. \"As a result, Australia's petrol prices are less than in most OECD countries.\" The OECD is a grouping of 38 countries with large market economies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to placing these prices against our average wages, Australia starts to fare even better.\n\n\n\n\n\nVidyattama estimates that each household in Australia consumes around 30 litres of petrol a week, which equates to about $60, or 3 per cent of the average income in Australia.\n\n\n\nBut global prices don't tell the full story\n\nWhile Australia may have a lower fuel excise than many countries, that doesn't mean the tax's overall impact on household budgets is small.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor one, Australia is a car-dependent country \u2014 far more reliant on vehicles than many other OECD nations, especially those in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even in the US, the level of public transport is much better than Australia, especially outside the capital cities,\" Vidyattama said.\n\n\n\nHawkins agrees: \"Australians drive more than Europeans because our cities sprawl and we don't have as good public transport, making us more car-dependent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2022 Census, the average Australian household owns 1.8 vehicles. More than 90 per cent of households reported owning at least one car, and over half (55 per cent) had two or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It just shows how dependent Australia is on the car \u2014 and therefore, on fuel,\" Vidyattama said.\n\n\n\nLooking to save on your petrol prices? Data says you should fill up more often. Source: SBS News \"In some cities like Melbourne and Sydney, there's probably less dependence on cars for daily commutes,\" he added. \"But in other cities and regional areas, car dependence is much higher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also notes that geography plays a major role. \"Where you live and the quality of public transport in those areas affects how much the fuel excise actually impacts your daily budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHawkins adds that Australians also tend to drive larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 another factor in our overall petrol spending.\n\n\n\nSo, would cutting the excise help?\n\nIn its budget reply, the Opposition proposed to cut the fuel excise from 50.8 cents a litre to 25.4 cents. It said the cut would save a driver who fills up the average 55-litre tank each week about $14 a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Vidyattama is sceptical. \"I was thinking that the number is inflated,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHawkins says the figures seem to be based on the assumption that households are spending $10,000 a year on petrol \u2014 something that may only be true for a small number of people living outside major cities.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition would dump tax cuts for cheaper fuel as Dutton accused of copying Morrison\n\nAnd, as Vidyattama points out, not everyone will benefit: \"Those who don't drive will see no benefit from the excise drop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the proposed changes might nudge prices down slightly, the savings may not be significant for every household \u2014 particularly those with better access to public transport or lower fuel needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "It may feel like the election campaign started some time ago but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese officially called it this morning and the major parties gave their first speeches today.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach party will be working as hard as it can to win votes and false and exaggerated claims may appear.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's go through the accuracy of five big claims made on Friday by Albanese as well as Opposition leader Peter Dutton and Greens leader Adam Bandt.\n\n\n\nAlbanese: 'Only Labor is acting on the cost-of-living ... Only a vote for Labor is a vote for stronger Medicare'\n\nLabor has made a number of cost-of-living promises including income tax cuts, expanding the Help to Buy scheme for first homebuyers, and capping the cost of medications on the PBS.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian federal election 2025 explained: Everything you need to know\n\nBut the Liberal Party would strongly disagree that Labor is the only one acting on this issue. It has promised to lower energy bills and cut Australia's fuel excise to lower petrol prices .\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has also agreed to match the $8.5 billion Labor is planning to inject into Medicare to expand the bulk billing incentive , and to provide further incentive payments for clinics to bulk bill.\n\n\n\nAlbanese: 'The Liberals are promising to increase income tax for all 14 million Australian taxpayers and because Peter Dutton needs to find $600 billion to pay for nuclear reactors that will provide 4 per cent of Australia's energy needs some time in the 2040s, that money has to come from somewhere'\n\nSo Dutton hasn't explicitly announced an income tax increase, but the Coalition has said it won't support Albanese's tax cuts, due to kick in next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn nuclear, the figure Albanese appears to be quoting comes from the Smart Energy Council. It estimates the cost of building seven nuclear reactors proposed by the Coalition would be between $116-$600 billion, and they would provide 3.7 per cent of Australia\u2019s energy mix in 2050.\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Party released its own costings from Frontier Economics suggesting its nuclear policy would cost $331 million, which it says is $263 billion less than Labor's renewable transition costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe costings of Dutton's nuclear plan are somewhat in dispute. The CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) have both said nuclear is twice as expensive as renewables.\n\n\n\nDutton: Australians are now paying on average 18 per cent more for rent ... and over 30 per cent more for power and gas\n\nThe Opposition leader is sort of on the money here but not quite.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoreLogic data confirms that since the Albanese government came into power in May 2022, rents nationally have risen about 18 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity prices actually fell 9.9 per cent in the December 2024 quarter, and 25.2 per cent in the 12 months to January 2025, but some households faced bill spikes of up to 40 per cent before this, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\n\n\nDutton: [Australians] are losing hope for their future \u2014 29,000 small businesses have gone broke over the course of the Albanese government's first term\n\nData from Australia's Security and Investments Commission (ASIC) shows around 28,900 \"companies entered external administration or had a controller appointed\" since the Albanese government took power.\n\n\n\nBut ASIC's figures don't make the distinction that these are all \"small businesses\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA small business is defined by the ABS as having either fewer than 20 employees or an aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million.\n\n\n\nBandt: 'Minority government is coming. And with the major parties offering about as attractive as a dead fish, you can see why'\n\nIt's a possibility no-one will win the federal election outright and Australia will have a minority government .\n\n\n\n\n\nSome experts told SBS News that polling indicates a minority government is looking pretty likely this time around.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Bandt is calling this result before anyone's voted.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the dead fish reference, he's likely referring to his colleague Sarah Hanson-Young's Senate stunt , where she held up a dead salmon in protest against Labor's salmon-farming legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\n\n\n\nListen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is very modest, what we're going to be doing is a 25 per cent tariff on all cars not made in the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's U-S President, Donald Trump, announcing a new round of tariffs, this time for the car industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom April 2, that fee will be payable on top of any foreign vehicle that enters the U-S.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllrich Auto owner Josh Allrich in Atlanta says he's concerned because the tariffs will raise the cost of new cars by 15 thousand dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's already expensive out here, and now that he's adding this tariff it's going to make things a lot more expensive. My wheelhouse is economy cars, affordable cars, and now, this tariff is going to directly hit us because it's gonna just make things go up. So I haven't heard anything just yet, but I am looking forward to people now rushing in to buy some cars.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is what Loretta Acosta is doing.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is looking for a new car at a dealership in Michigan, before the tariffs are brought in.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Acosta says she trusts the President has made a decision that benefits Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels like the end game is bringing industry back to America. So I mean, that is great for jobs. And it certainly would be good for investment, especially capital investment if you are a venture capitalist, so I think it would be good, but there are pros and cons to everything, of course.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Allrich agrees with that perspective, despite the impact on his own business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My grandfather worked for Ford for about 25 years, and he was originally from Haiti. He was really able to build a career just based off being at Ford all those years. He was able to retire and leave his family with a whole lot, so I understand. Trump really wanted to kind of bring a lot of jobs back to the states, especially kind of labour jobs you know with these different car companies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Simoni is an economist with Luiss University in Rome.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has a different perspective, that the U-S economy - and its people - will suffer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe new tariffs introduced by President Trump will have an impact on the European car industry and will have a strong impact on American consumers because the prices of their cars is going to go up. And of course European carmakers are going to look into other geographies and perhaps also selling more cars within Europe.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican economists also say the tariffs will hurt U-S car manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomist Professor Tibor Besedes at the Georgia Institute of Technology has concerns over the investment that can be made in the industry if tariffs are removed by another U-S administration in four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he says some American businesses may have major production issues when the tariffs on automobile parts come into play in May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are very few supply chains in cars that are completely within the United States. Many supply chains in the car industry are within the NAFTA, USMCA countries like Canada, Mexico, United States for parts and unfinished cars travel across borders multiple times before they finally produced and assembled either in any of those three countries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberto Valvassori is the President of the Italian Association of Automotive Industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is confident the luxury European car market would be less sensitive to price rises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if you have the desire to drive Italian prestigious cars it prevails on costs. In fact it can make even more of a difference than a regular car. The consumer will be willing to pay this extra levy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut worries remain over the diplomatic implications of the fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nHildegard Mueller is head of Verbrand der Automobilindustrie, the industry body in Germany, which is Europe's biggest car exporter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will have significant consequences for growth, employment, prosperity and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. The U.S. economy and U.S. consumers will also suffer from the fact that the U.S. wants to withdraw from the international trade partnership.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are similar sentiments across Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter embracing the return of a once staunch ally with major investments in the U-S, Japan\u2019s car makers now find themselves on the front line of a burgeoning global trade war.\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described his country as the number one investor to the U-S and says it is not right that all countries should be treated the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We must consider what will serve Japan's national interest. We are strongly requesting the U-S not to apply these 25% tariffs on Japan. There are different options. We have to consider which is the most effective and have all options in mind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a huge blow to South Korea, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Minister Ahn Duk-Geun says half of the country's car exports are sent to the U-S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"About 50% of our automobile exports go to the United States, so there are concerns about significant damage to the auto industry. The difficulties will be especially severe for not only the finished car manufacturers but also the parts suppliers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chinese government has condemned the new tariffs, with Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun saying there are no winners in a trade war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The U.S.'s actions violate WTO rules, undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system and the common interests of people of all countries, and are not conducive to solving its own problems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe so-called Trump tariffs have been a body blow to America's key trade partners and their major industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry analysts have said they could be rolled back or modified before they come into effect next week, but there is no such indication yet from the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Canada is doubling down.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Prime Minister Mark Carney will convene a Cabinet meeting in the coming hours over what he has described as an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the old relationship between Canada and the United States is \"over,\" following the car tariff announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called out President Trump directly.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Labor\u2019s tax cuts promise relief to all taxpayers, while Opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s proposed fuel excise cut aims to bring down petrol prices. But as experts weigh in, doubts are emerging about whether either policy will deliver meaningful relief to those who need it most.\n\n\n\nThe case for tax cuts\n\nThe Labor government has legislated to cut the lowest tax rate \u2014 which applies to incomes between $18,001 from $45,000 \u2014 by 1 per cent in July next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat will bring the tax rate in that income bracket down to 15 per cent, with a further percentage point cut to come the following year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's estimated that the revised tax cuts would give all taxpayers up to $268 in 2026-27 and $536 every year after that.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, most Australians affected by the cut will be saving roughly an extra $5 a week in the first year of the change followed by $10 per week each subsequent year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has pitched the plan as a fairer approach to economic relief, highlighting that the changes will put more money into the pockets of everyday Australians rather than disproportionately benefitting high earners.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition would dump tax cuts for cheaper fuel as Dutton accused of copying Morrison\n\nHowever, policital scientist Dr Paul Williams from Griffith University argues that the proposed tax cut is unlikely to sway voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a cost of living election. In this climate, voters are sensitive to the hip pocket nerve. It's going to take more than a $5-a-week tax cut that will take a year to kick in to motivate those that are doing it tough. A vote choice is an incredibly complicated, nuanced process of factors,\" Williams said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you look at Labor's budget, it was quite modest in its promises, and it was more or less compounding or extending programs that have been done before because it was a budget Labor didn't want, for an election they didn't want \u2014 Labor wanted the election last year so the timing is all out for them.\"\n\n\n\nDutton's fuel excise pitch\n\nA Dutton-led Coalition government has promised to dump tax cuts in favour of a temporary cut to the fuel excise in a move it says would save families hundreds of dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal would halve the fuel excise for 12 months, lowering the rate on petrol and diesel from about 50 cents to 25 cents per litre. The plan would save a one-car family about $750 a year \u2014 or $14 a week \u2014 and a two-car family about $1,500 a year \u2014 or $28 a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's expected to cost $6 billion a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomist Thomas Walker argues that both tax cuts and fuel excise would do little to alleviate immediate financial pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These promises are so modest on both sides, they're going to have such a little impact on people's take-home pay in the next two to three years,\" Walker said.\n\n\n\n\"Cost-of-living increases \u2014 particularly in housing, groceries, and energy \u2014 continue to outpace wage growth, meaning extra dollars from tax relief may quickly be swallowed up by rising expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are also concerns about the inflationary impact of injecting more disposable income into the economy \u2014 these policies also don't help those that need it most like students and those on JobSeeker benefits.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth policies highlight how cost-of-living pressures are dominating the election agenda. But beyond tax cuts and fuel relief, Australians are grappling with housing affordability, wage stagnation, and rising essential costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Walker adds that neither policy adequately addresses the root causes of financial strain, he says Australia is long overdue for \"big picture\" structural reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tax cuts aren't tax reform,\" Walker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Both sides refuse to address the structural inequalities, which are really evident to people. We have vast sums of money that are given out in tax breaks and concessions, flowing to the wrong people. Most economists say that our government is overly generous and we need tax reform, but both political parties just don't seemingly want to go there.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Tancred Stakes day at Rosehill, featuring two group 1 races, has been moved to Tuesday after it was washed out on Saturday morning.\n\nRacing NSW stewards announced just before 8.30am that following overnight rain, and with up to 50mm forecast for the remainder of the day, the meeting had been postponed due to the condition of the track.\n\nRacing has been called off at Rosehill, where Marhoona took out the Golden Slipper last Saturday. Credit: Getty Images\n\nOfficials said at 6.55am that the surface was rated a soft 7 and a further inspection would be held at 9am. However, further heavy rain prompted an earlier decision. The Rosehill area had more than 25mm overnight and into the early morning.\n\nOfficials announced the meeting, featuring the $1.5 million weight-for-age Tancred Stakes (2400m) and $750,000 Vinery Stud Stakes for three-year-old fillies, would be held on Tuesday.",

Not Victoria Hynes, whose late grandfather Peter Melocco\u2019s mosaic flooring once decorated hundreds of public buildings in Sydney.\n\nAs a child, Hynes was taken on walks through Sydney\u2019s CBD to see the work of Peter and his brothers, Antonio and Galliano, known as the Melocco Brothers. It was everywhere, she said, from \u201cthe Hogwarts-like splendour\u201d of the State Theatre to banks, Dymocks and big department stores.\n\n\u201cLook down,\u201d her mother said when they visited the crypt of St Mary\u2019s Cathedral and the State Library\u2019s Mitchell vestibule to see one of the library\u2019s treasures, the Tasman map created in mosaic.\n\nZeny Edwards, author of a new book about the Meloccos, said the contribution of the Italian-born brothers to the country\u2019s cultural and architectural heritage had, like that of many migrants, been grossly overlooked.\n\nThey had elevated architecture into art. Edwards described it as \u201cpainting in stone\u201d, which is the book\u2019s title.\n\nSitting on a bench with Hynes, overlooking the library\u2019s mosaic representing the travels by Abel Tasman in 1642 and 1644, Edwards said it was \u201can amazing and complete work of art\u201d.",

But the trend that has intrigued thousands online comes with a serious message from Australia Post.\n\nAustralian TikTok creators are buying and opening unclaimed mail in a popular new series of a videos. Source: TikTok/@the_kali_adventure, TikTok/@the_buxtons_wotsup\n\nA new 'mystery box' TikTok trend stemming from the US and making waves in Australia has sparked concern for the safety and privacy of Aussie residents.\n\nWhile \u2018unboxing\u2019 videos have been hugely popular on the internet for years, the latest items being opened by Aussie content creators could have a connection to you or someone you know.\n\nFeatured in a growing number of Australian-based videos are \u2018mystery boxes\u2019 containing packages and parcels that are reportedly \u2018unclaimed\u2019 mail that never made it to its intended owner. The packages are still sealed, with labels attached that show the names and addresses of the intended owner.\n\nAmong them is a charging station meant for Craig in Queensland. A motorbike part for Mark in Tasmania. A garden hose for Steven in South Australia. New shoes for Belinda in Western Sydney.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA box of five packages is being sold for $50, while larger boxes cost up to $150.\n\nSome packages have Australia Post labelling on them, leading the postal giant to express serious concerns about the mystery boxes and the details left on the labels.\n\n\u201cAustralia Post has significant concerns about the inclusion of addressed packaging within these boxes and confirms we have no connection or affiliation with the mystery box scheme,\u201d a spokesperson told Yahoo News.\n\n\u201cWe encourage anyone receiving envelopes or mailer boxes with address or personal details included to dispose of them immediately and securely.\n\n\u201cAustralia Post urges social media creators to take care when making videos of this nature to avoid revealing customer address details.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to unclaimed mail?\n\nLost or undeliverable mail is an unfortunate occurrence for AusPost, who handle around 2.5 billion items every year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn some cases, if items are addressed incorrectly or if a label falls off, the parcels are returned to AusPost's Mail Redistribution Centre, where they are opened and catalogued.\n\nAfter two months, if the owners can't be found or no-one has submitted a 'lost mail' enquiry, the items may be auctioned for charity.\n\nOne of the approved auction houses is Theodore Bruce, who say they have recently sold a variety of designer and luxury goods that came from unclaimed packages.\n\nThese include:\n\nLouis Vuitton Handbags\n\nSmartphones, laptops and tablets\n\nSneakers and trainers such as Nike and Yeezy\n\nKitchen appliances including Thermomix\n\nDesigner sunglasses, watches and clothes\n\nAusPost said unlike the now-viral mail boxes, they would never sell 'mystery' items, only products from opened packages that can be checked over before being sold. They also never approve any item to be sold if they contain identifying markings or labels.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
