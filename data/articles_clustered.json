    "text": "US President Donald Trump says he will impose a 100 per cent tariff on computer chips, raising the spectre of higher prices for electronics, autos, household appliances and other essential products dependent on the processors powering the digital age.\n\n\"We'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100 per cent on chips and semiconductors,\" Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\n\"But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he will impose a 100 per cent tariff on computer chips. (AP)\n\nThe announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration's most onerous tariffs.\n\nThe Republican president said companies that make computer chips in the US would be spared the import tax.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation.\n\nInvestors seemed to interpret the potential tariff exemptions as a positive for Apple and other major tech companies that have been making huge financial commitments to manufacture more chips and other components in the US.\n\nBig Tech already has made collective commitments to invest about $US1.5 trillion ($2.3 trillion) in the US since Trump moved back into the White House in January.\n\nThat figure includes a $600 billion promise from Apple after the iPhone maker boosted its commitment by tacking another $100 billion on to a previous commitment made in February.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook holds a gift from President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. (AP)\n\nNow the question is whether the deal brokered between Cook and Trump will be enough to insulate the millions of iPhones made in China and India from the tariffs that the administration has already imposed and reduce the pressure on the company to raise prices on the new models expected to be unveiled next month.\n\nWall Street certainly seems to think so.\n\nAfter Apple's stock price gained 5 per cent in Wednesday regular trading sessions, the shares rose by another 3 per cent in extended trading after Trump announced some tech companies won't be hit with the latest tariffs while Cook stood alongside him.\n\nThe shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, which also has recently made big commitments to the US, rose slightly in extended trading to add to the $1 trillion gain in market value the Silicon Valley company has made since the start of Trump's second administration.\n\nThe stock price of computer chip pioneer Intel, which has fallen on hard times, also climbed in extended trading.\n\nInquiries sent to chip makers Nvidia and Intel were not immediately answered.\n\nThe chip industry's main trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, declined to comment on Trump's latest tariffs.\n\nDemand for computer chips has been climbing worldwide, with sales increasing 19.6 per cent in the year-ended in June, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organisation.\n\nTrump's tariff threats mark a significant break from existing plans to revive computer chip production in the U.S. that were drawn up during the administration of President Joe Biden.\n\nSince taking over from Biden, Trump has been deploying tariffs to incentivize more domestic production.\n\nEssentially, the president is betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for mobile phones, TVs and refrigerators.\n\nBy contrast, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that Biden signed into law in 2022 provided more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.",

(Photo by Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nHere's what to know about chikungunya:\n\nWhat is chikungunya?\n\nChikungunya is a disease caused by a virus of the same name.\n\nThe chikungunya virus was first identified in people sickened during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. Its name is derived from a word in the Makonde language, which means \"that which bends up,\" due to the severe pain it can cause.\n\nChikungunya is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly causes mild symptoms. The majority of people who get chikungunya recover without needing medical attention after one to two weeks.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chikungunya?\n\nChikungunya typically produces symptoms including fever, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue and a rash.\n\nBut in rare cases, it can cause debilitating joint pain that persists for months or even years. Patients who get severely ill often require hospitalisation because of the risk of organ damage.\n\nA sanitation worker sprays insecticide to prevent the spread of Chikungunya on August 3, 2025 in Dongguan, Guangdong Province of China (Getty)\n\nThe World Health Organisation says severe cases and deaths are rare and mostly occur in babies or elderly people with underlying health conditions.\n\nIs there a treatment or vaccine?\n\nThere is no specific treatment for chikungunya, but health workers can treat the symptoms by giving medicines to lower fevers or ease muscle pain.\n\nTwo vaccines have been approved in several regions, including Britain, Brazil, Canada and Europe.\n\nThose are mostly targeted at travellers and are not widely available in the countries most affected by chikungunya.\n\nWhere does chikungunya normally occur?\n\nChikungunya causes regular outbreaks in Africa, Asia and the Americas, with occasional small epidemics in Europe.\n\nChikungunya virus as seen through a microscope. (The Pirbright Institute)\n\nAs of July, there have been about 240,000 cases of chikungunya, including 90 deaths in 16 countries, according to the European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nThe countries that reported the highest number of infections were Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Peru.\n\nWhat's happening in China?\n\nAn outbreak of chikungunya in Foshan, near Hong Kong, has prompted Chinese authorities to take measures like distributing mosquito nets, having workers spray residential areas, streets and construction sites with insecticide.\n\nPeople who do not empty bottles, flower pots or other outdoor receptacles, where water might accumulate and allow mosquitoes to breed, can be subject to fines of up to 10,000 yuan ($2140) and have their electricity cut off.\n\nResidents wade through debris along a flood-hit street after waters from a river overwhelmed towns following days of heavy rain, in Huaiji County, south China's Guangdong Province on June 19, 2025 (Deng Hua/Xinhua via AP)\n\nThe US has issued a travel advisory telling citizens not to visit China's Guangdong province, the location of Donguan and several other business hubs, along with countries such as Bolivia and island nations in the Indian Ocean.\n\nUnusually heavy rains and high temperatures this year have worsened the crisis in China.\n\nAre we seeing more chikungunya outbreaks?\n\nYes.\n\nThe number of outbreaks has increased since 2000, just as there have been more outbreaks of other mosquito-transmitted diseases like dengue and Zika, according to Robert Jones, an assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nA municipal worker fumigates a residential area to check the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in New Delhi, India, in 2016.

    "text": "The bad news in last Friday's US jobs report may have been overshadowed when President Donald Trump fired the commissioner in charge of producing it.\n\nBut economists haven't forgotten about the American job market \u2013 and they're growing concerned.\n\nSome of the jobs report data has economists using a word they haven't uttered in several months: recession.\n\nAre Donald Trump's tariff measures impacting the United States' job market? Economists say they may well be. (AP)\n\nHiring over the past three months slowed dramatically, creating problems for the economists and statisticians at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), whose job is to make sense of the payroll data they get from thousands of businesses across the country.\n\nAs new data came in about May and June's employment, the BLS was forced to sharply lower those months' job totals from their preliminary estimates.\n\nThe BLS revised May and June's jobs totals lower by a combined 258,000 jobs. That massive revision gave economists some serious agita.\n\nLarger revisions have happened before, but every time changes that large have taken place over the course of at least two months, the US economy has been in a recession \u2013 at least since records began in 1968.\n\n\"The job market is terrible,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office during the George W. Bush administration, said.\n\n\"Outside of education and health, the economy has lost private sector jobs in the past three months. That's terrible.\"\n\nWarnings \u2013 but no recession yet\n\nThe US economy has added an average of just 85,000 jobs per month this year, which is well below the 177,000 jobs that the economy added on average each month before the pandemic.\n\nPoor jobs data doesn't mean the US economy is in or going into a recession.\n\nSeveral recent economic indicators are pointing in the wrong direction \u2013 weakness in second-quarter gross domestic product and slower-than-expected growth in both the manufacturing and services sectors, for example.\n\nBut, importantly, the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is responsible for declaring recessions, tracks four big indicators of economic activity \u2013 consumer spending, personal income, factory production and employment.\n\nNone have been pointing to a recession or even that the US economy is on the precipice of a recession.\n\nThat is, until Friday's jobs report.\n\nYet even the recession alarms it sounded come with some caveats.\n\nRecent moribund job growth was likely distorted by business uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs, and it's too early to tell whether it will rebound or continue to remain at this low level, noted Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist.\n\nThere are some concerns the United States could be heading towards a recession. (AP)\n\n\"The US economy is in a muddle-through environment,\" Lerner, who said the Federal Reserve probably needs to take action to lower interest rates soon because the jobs report suggests it might be behind the curve.\n\nThe Fed has known about the slowing hiring for quite some time.\n\nBut the sharp pullback over the past few months \u2013 data the Fed didn't have when it made its decision last week to hold interest rates steady \u2013 probably means the economy is considerably weaker than economists had expected.\n\n\"Friday's jobs report was terrible with recessionary level numbers, but slowing hiring is not new,\" Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management, said.\n\n\"While Friday's report does not mean we are entering a recession, it shows that companies are freezing hiring and firing until there is more policy certainty and business confidence.\"\n\nIronically, the leading culprit for slowing jobs growth may be the thing that has been holding the Fed back from cutting rates: Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe Fed had been in wait and see mode in case tariffs pushed prices higher.\n\nThe flip side is that the US economy appeared strong enough to handle higher interest rates.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took a cautious approach when reacting to Donald Trump's tariff measures announced in April. (AP)\n\nBut it seems businesses are no longer waiting.\n\nThey're freezing hiring and changing their investments as they grow fearful that tariffs could raise costs and hurt the economy.\n\n\"The president's unorthodox economic agenda and policies may be starting to make a dent in the labour market,\" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, said.\n\n\"Businesses are not waiting as they are cutting back on the numbers of new workers they bring on board, which means we can no longer count on the employment markets to be a positive factor supporting economic growth in the weeks and months ahead.\"\n\nTrump's immigration policy appears to be taking a toll, too.\n\nSince April, 1.4 million people dropped out of the US labour force \u2013 802,000 of whom were foreign-born.\n\nThat may have helped make the jobs report look slightly better than it actually is.\n\nBecause of the way the survey was taken, if the 503,000 who dropped out of the labour force but still wanted to work had told the BLS that they were actively searching for a job, the unemployment rate would have risen to 4.5 per cent last month, Rupkey said.\n\nInstead, it rose to 4.2 per cent.\n\nAbout those revisions\u2026\n\nThe revisions, though surprising for their sheer size, were not fully unexpected.\n\nThey align with the other inputs that analysts have been tracking, Goldman Sachs economists said in a note to clients on Saturday, and they help paint a clearer picture of the economy.\n\nOther key jobs indicators \"have slowed significantly in recent months\", Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius wrote.\n\n\"Taken together, the economic data confirm our view that the US economy is growing at a below-potential pace.\"\n\nIn other words, Goldman Sachs isn't shocked by the revisions; if anything, they fit with the broader puzzle pieces.\n\nThe revisions were \"undeniably concerning,\" Bank of America economists said in a note to investors on Monday.\n\nBut the \"silver lining\" is that a considerable amount of the revisions had to do with seasonal adjustments \u2013 basically algorithms that needed adjusting as new data came in.\n\nGoldman Sachs was not massively caught off-guard by the tariff revisions. (Associated Press)\n\nThe BLS considers its initial jobs numbers to be preliminary when they're first published, because some respondents fail to report their payroll data by the BLS' deadline.\n\nLow survey responses can make the report more challenging to estimate.\n\nBut the BLS continues to collect the payroll data as it's reported, and it revises the data accordingly.\n\nTo extrapolate the data for the entire country, BLS economists add in some educated guesswork , based on seasonal hiring trends.\n\nThe BLS also smooths out the data with calculations known as seasonal adjustments to avoid huge spikes and dips in data each month.\n\nThe data are also revised because of those seasonal adjustments.\n\nIf the more complete data comes in well above or below the preliminary data, revisions can be exacerbated by the BLS' seasonal adjustments, which sometimes need to be recalculated.",

(Instagram/@staceymcewanbooks)\n\n\ufeff\"Being of any kind of public figure on social media feels a lot like putting your head on a chopping block and just hoping that no one swings the blade,\" she said.\n\n\"It's the wild, wild west out there and one certainly does have to be careful.\"\n\nIt's up to most authors to run their own \ufeffsocial media accounts, promoting their books and interacting with fans while also making sure they don't say or do the wrong thing.\n\nBecause being 'cancelled'\ufeff can tank book sales and slash an author's income in an instant and most don't have huge advances or established fortunes to fall back on.\n\n\"I got an advance for [my first book], but it was a small amount and it certainly wasn't anything that was going to set me up for the future,\" McEwan said.\n\n\"I really had to rely on how well the book was going to sell.\"\n\nBack then she had her teaching career to fall back on but that's gone now.\n\nNo backup plan\ufeff\n\nWhile she was still teaching part-time, \ufeffMcEwan landed a global deal with publishing powerhouse Simon & Schuster for her next duology.\n\nThe advance alone was enough to finance her for a year, so she took \ufeffunpaid leave from teaching to write A Forbidden Alchemy.\n\nThe novel follows Nina Harrow and Patrick Colson, childhood friends who find themselves on opposite sides of a war fuelled by class inequality.\n\n\"I like the idea of the lower classes questioning why it is that they must remain so,\" McEwan said.\ufeff\n\nMcEwan took \ufeffunpaid leave from teaching to write A Forbidden Alchemy.

    "text": "Recently, something odd happened to Briana Blackett. She was attending a meeting to give a colleague some content feedback, which isn't unusual in her volunteer work as a disability advocate.\n\nBut what unfolded after she logged onto Zoom made the journalist question professional etiquette and how artificial intelligence could change the future of work.\n\n\"You could see my face on screen, you could see the project manager's face on screen. But in place of the producer, we had an AI note taker. We started the meeting talking to the robot, saying, 'Here are some messages we'd like you to send back to your human' and 'human, if you're listening, please jump on now because these are things we need to have a nuanced discussion about',\" said Blackett, Future Women's Head of Content.\n\nBrianna Blackett's experience has left her questioning how AI tools should be used in the office. (Supplied)\n\nAfter about ten minutes instructing the notetaker like a junior staff member reporting back to its boss, they texted the producer to ask if he was coming. He appeared within seconds and they got on with the meeting - but the interaction left Blackett confused.\n\n\"I thought, 'Oh wow, is this the done thing now?' And if so, this is not good. You need to communicate in advance. It prompted me to think, in what scenario is it okay to send a robot? What's the process you should be undertaking in order to clear that with everyone? What's the AI etiquette here?\n\n\"Perhaps we need to start setting up some kind of etiquette process in how we decide when it's okay to send a robot.\"\n\nUniversity of Technology Sydney (UTS) Business School Associate Professor Robyn Johns can already see artificial intelligence changing the unwritten rules for workplaces.\n\nHowever, she believes we need to be mindful about how and when we're adopting new processes.\n\n\"Just because the tools are available doesn't mean you should automatically use them. We need to start considering whether it's appropriate in all circumstances,\" said Associate Professor Johns.\n\n\"Things like digital notetakers or recording meetings, you should be giving people a heads up. They certainly change expectations about how we engage in those meetings.\"\n\nIn July, a global survey of more than 3000 cyber security professionals found that while 81 percent believe employees in their organisation use AI, only 28 percent have a formal, comprehensive policy in place.\n\nIt is this lack of policy - which could speak to a lack of forethought - that worries Associate Professor Johns.\n\n\"AI can either reinforce or potentially erode trust within an organisation. [It's] about the transparency associated with how we utilise or implement these types of tools. Having consultations and discussions around how it's going to be used. Seek clarity around [how your staff feel] because it might be that some people perceive it as a control mechanism rather than a productivity enhancer.\"\n\nFor Blackett, a 'proud Gen Xer' who can clearly recall how email transformed professional etiquette decades ago, human communication is key to ensuring we reap the benefits of AI while not leaving others out in the cold.\n\n\"This is the latest technological advance, but there is also going to need to be some social construction around it.\n\n\"Perhaps we need to start setting up some kind of etiquette process in how we decide when it's okay to send a robot. Sending it to a client requiring a complex and nuanced discussion... probably isn't ideal.\"",

Trains will also save transit time, Salvini said.\n\nThe project could provide a boost to Italy's commitment to raise defense spending to 5 per cent of GDP targeted by NATO, as the government has indicated it would classify the bridge as defence-related, helping it to meet a 1.5 per cent security component.\n\nItaly argues that the bridge would form a strategic corridor for rapid troop movements and equipment deployment to NATO's southern flanks, qualifying it as a \"security-enhancing infrastructure.\"\n\nSalvini confirmed the intention to classify the project as dual use, but said that was up to Italy's defence and economic ministers.\n\nEnvironmental groups have lodged complaints with the EU, citing concerns that the project will impact migratory birds (WeBuild Group)\n\nWith three car lanes in each direction flanked by a double-track railway, the bridge would have the capacity to carry 6000 cars an hour and 200 trains a day (WeBuild Group)\n\nA group of more than 600 professors and researchers signed a letter earlier this summer opposing the military classification, noting that such a move would require additional assessments to see if it could withstand military use.\n\nOpponents also say the designation would potentially make the bridge a target.\n\nEnvironmental groups have lodged complaints with the EU, citing concerns that the project will impact migratory birds, noting that environmental studies had not demonstrated that the project is a public imperative and that any environmental damage would be offset.\n\nThe original government decree reactivating the bridge project included language giving the Interior Ministry control over anti-mafia measures.\n\nThe original government decree reactivating the bridge project included language giving the Interior Ministry control over anti-mafia measures.

It includes a wing profile and a deck shape that resembles a fighter jet fuselage with openings to allow wind to pass through the structure, according to WeBuild.\n\nAddressing concerns about building the bridge over the Messina fault, which triggered a deadly quake in 1908, WeBuild has emphasised that suspension bridges are structurally less vulnerable to seismic forces.\n\nIt noted that such bridges have been built in seismically active areas, including Japan.

You absolutely suck at parking!\" it read.\n\nFlipping it over, the man saw a note in thick black pen. \"MOVE YOUR CAR!\"\n\nBut the man, who asked to stay anonymous, hadn't done anything wrong. His vehicle, parked opposite his home on a residential street in Milldale, north Auckland, was not in a reserved or disabled spot - it was parked perfectly legally.\n\nHe penned a response on the back - \"street parking is public\" - and placed it on the windscreen of his neighbour's car.\n\nOccupants of an Auckland house have been using a road cone to mark out \"their\" parking spot. (Reddit)\n\nWhile the card was unwelcome, it wasn't a surprise. The same neighbour who left the card had been using a road cone to mark \"their\" space, reserving one of the two street parking spaces outside their home.\n\n\"The cone situation has been going on for a while,\" the man told Stuff .\n\nHe said the neighbour, who lived in a property with a double garage and driveway, kept the cone in his boot, putting it in place whenever he left home in the afternoons.\n\nWhen Stuff visited on Tuesday, a woman, who did not want to be named but who said she was one of the owners of the house, answered the door.\n\nShe said: \"It's not really a public parking space. People keep parking their cars on our spot, we've got three vehicles and this is the parking allocated for our home and that's the only reason why.\n\n\"When we leave for five minutes and we come back, then we have to park way up in the street.\"\n\nThis note was no surprise to the resident who found it on his windscreen. (Reddit)\n\nShe said it was about \"common sense\". They had told the owner of the car the note was left on that they didn't mind them parking there during the day, but that they wanted the space from 5pm when they were all home.\n\n\"They are moaning about it, but like we said and explained to them, have a little bit of common sense.\n\n\"We said we don't mind you parking there but my husband is coming home later. Where the hell is he supposed to park?\"\n\nStuff sent photos from the scene to Auckland Transport.

    "text": "For the first time in decades, brandy is returning to the Coonawarra.\n\nThe region was once a major producer of the wine-based liquor, before it dropped out of fashion.\n\nThe idea to bring back brandy to the Coonawarra came from the director of Majella Wines, Brian \"Prof\" Lynn.\n\nAfter contemplating launching a spirit, he thought brandy would be the most natural progression from wine.\n\n\"In the old days, if you had leftover wine, you would distil that and make brandy,\" he said.\n\nMr Lynn says the process of making brandy reduces waste in the vineyard. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nIt has so far been a straightforward addition for the business, requiring only a distillation still in addition to their existing wine, rainwater and wooden ageing barrels.\n\nMr Lynn has found the distilling process to be quick, only taking about six hours.\n\nBut the ageing process is slow, with all brandy legally required to be aged for two years in a wooden cask.\n\n\"There is a lot of patience involved,\" Mr Lynn said.\n\nHistoric connections\n\nDespite the strong historic origins of brandy in the region, Majella's release is the first to include the region on the labelling.\n\nIn the early 1900s, tastes were changing and demand for dry reds dwindled. The brandy produced with the surplus grapes would eventually become generically branded brandy.\n\nArthur Hoffmann's Wynns Coonawarra Estate logbook for making wine and brandy. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"You couldn't sell the wine \u2014 no-one wanted to drink dry red wine back then \u2026 so it was decided to convert all that wine into brandy,\" Mr Lynn said.\n\nBut as other wine varieties grew in popularity, Coonawarra's brandy production declined and eventually stopped in the late 20th century.\n\nMuch of the knowledge about Coonawarra brandy has been lost through the decades, but there are some in the region still with connections to the liquor.\n\nDiana Clayfield's family has strong historic ties to the Coonawarra wine industry. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nCoonawarra resident Diana Clayfield's father, Arthur Hoffmann, was a viticulturalist, wine and brandy maker in the region.\n\n\"He enjoyed doing it [making brandy],\" she said.\n\n\" It's nice to see it back in the Coonawarra. \"\n\nMs Clayfield remembers the generation before her enjoying a brandy, and sometimes even using it for medicinal purposes.\n\n\"If you had a flu, they warmed brandy and wine up together and had it as a medicine,\" she said.\n\n'Cure-all' brandy\n\nIt was this connection with medicine that helped brandy to become so popular, with production peaking in the 1960s.\n\nTo be labelled brandy, the distilled spirit is required to be aged two years in wooden casks. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nLuke McCarthy has extensively researched and written about Australian spirits and brandy.\n\nHe said hospital brandy emerged around the turn of the 20th century, with major brands producing it into the 1940s.\n\n\"Many brandies were marketed as 'invalid brandy' or 'hospital brandy' because at that stage hospitals, in particular, used a lot of brandy as a cure-all,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\nUsed wine barrels have been repurposed to age the brandy at Majella Wines in Coonawarra. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nThe term fell out of vogue around the same time brandy production declined.\n\nAnother blow was the federal excise on brandy, facing a large increase in the 1970s to be closer to other spirits.\n\n\"It's a combination of economic forces, government intervention and then shifting consumer trends, which have seen brandy really ride this sort of roller coaster ride over the last 100 years,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\nReinvigorating brandy\n\nAustralian Distillers Association president Holly Klintworth said, although the market for other spirits like gin had become crowded, there was an opportunity ahead for brandy.\n\nThe first Coonawarra branded brandy was released earlier this year. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\n\"There's definitely a place in Australia for brandy and I hope that it's only a matter of time before more and more people start to rediscover just how amazing brandy can be,\" she said.\n\nAnd it could be a money spinner for wineries \u2014 Ms Klintworth's distillery turns \"about $16,000 worth of wine into the equivalent of $1.5 million worth of brandy\".\n\n\"It makes a lot of sense. We've got so many wine regions,\" she said.\n\n\" To be able to turn leftover wine, and in years of a wine glut, into a product and value-add to wine regions is a fantastic concept. \"\n\nThe Coonawarra region is known for its cabernet sauvignon wine. (ABC South East SA: Elsie Adamo)\n\nMr Lynn agrees that conditions are right for a comeback.\n\nHe was already ageing a fresh batch of brandy to release in future years.\n\n\"In the old days, brandy was huge; everyone drank brandy,\" he said.\n\n\" It's time to bring brandy back. \"",

    "text": "Australia is set to get another satellite internet provider in 2026, giving SpaceX's Starlink some long-awaited competition.\n\nGovernment-owned NBN Co has partnered with Amazon to roll out high-speed broadband using 3,200 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites from Amazon's Project Kuiper.\n\nReliable connectivity in the bush is essential for emergency services. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nStarlink already has about 7,000 operational satellites providing internet to remote parts of the country.\n\nWith Amazon entering the game, there will soon be more than 10,000 LEO satellites focused on delivering high-speed internet \u2014 and that is not counting all the other satellites in orbit.\n\nThe new service is expected to launch in 2026, and NBN Co says it will offer a major upgrade in speed and reliability for people currently using its satellite network.\n\nSince Sky Muster launched in 2015, ongoing issues with its reliability and performance prompted many internet users to switch to Starlink, which quickly became a popular provider thanks to its LEO satellites.\n\nThe transition from Sky Muster to LEO satellites has sparked hopes that a bit of competition might finally benefit regional users.\n\nAmazon's KA-01 mission launch earlier this year. (Supplied: Amazon Project Kuiper)\n\nNBN Co's chief development officer for regional and remote services, Gavin Williams, said the partnership would benefit new and existing customers.\n\nHe said the new venture with Amazon would replace NBN's Sky Muster, which is currently just two satellites 36,000 kilometres into space.\n\n\"The Kuiper constellation will be 3,200 satellites, so a lot more satellites, and in round numbers will be around 600 kilometres from Earth,\" he said.\n\nAmazon has built ground stations that will connect customers' outdoor boxes with satellites. (Supplied: NBN Co)\n\nMr Williams said this would greatly increase the speed of the internet for up to 300,000 customers.\n\n\"In an online world, the imperatives and significance of fast and reliable broadband in remote parts of the country [is vital],\" he said.\n\n\"If your home-based classroom's offline, you can't just pop the kids down to school.\n\n\"If your online shop doesn't work, you can't just pop down to Woolies down the street.\n\n\"It's literally and figuratively a lifeline for customers in remote WA.\"\n\nThe new satellite service will bring connectivity to isolated places within Australia. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nTechnology critical for remote towns\n\nFor remote areas, such as the Shire of Yalgoo, CEO Ian Holland said satellite technology was important for emergency services.\n\n\"A lot of our area historically hasn't been covered by anything other than a really slow-to-connect sat [satellite] phone,\" Mr Holland said.\n\n\"We've had some investment for Starlink units for our fire trucks, and I know that other emergency services such as WA Police and St John have been rolling out LEO equipment as well.\n\n\" Even just being able to make that phone call, talking with RFDS about a medical emergency, and anything that makes response faster and allows people to be tracked down faster is a massive boom to emergency services out here. \"\n\nIan Holland says while the satellites are great for isolated locations, the night sky becomes full of streaking satellites. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nMr Holland said that while competition between companies would be a win for consumers, the night sky was already getting crowded with satellites.\n\nStaying connected wherever we are comes at a cost.\n\n\"From a night sky perspective, we can already look up and see the trails of these objects flying through,\" Mr Holland said.\n\n\"I think that's the reality of where technology is going within this space.\"",

    "text": "For the first time in decades, parts of the northern prawn fishing fleet have stayed docked at the start of the tiger prawn season.\n\nThe season started on August 1, but Austral Fisheries general manager Andy Prendergast said it was the first time in nearly 60 years that some boats had not sailed.\n\n\"It's cheaper to not go than it is to go,\" he said.\n\n\"Our product's [sales price] has gone down by about 30 per cent, and our costs have gone through the roof.\n\n\" For the last four years, nobody's made a cent. As a matter of fact, we've been losing money. \"\n\nTiger prawn season opened on August 1 in the Northern Prawn Fishery. (Supplied: Austral Fisheries)\n\nWith 11 boats trawling through the Gulf of Carpentaria, Austral is the second-largest operator in the Northern Prawn Fishery, which has been open since the late 1960s.\n\nBut Mr Prendergast said only 45 of the 52 boats in the fleet ventured out over the weekend, with several choosing to stay docked due to mounting economic pressure.\n\n\"Hopefully the industry can resolve these issues over time, but we're in a bit of a tough space at the moment,\" he said.\n\nThe past four years have been particularly tough for the wild-caught prawn industry, with pandemic-driven inflation pushing costs up and profits down.\n\nAndy Prendergast is the general manager for Austral Fisheries. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nAdditionally, he said wild-caught prawns had to compete with cheaper products provided by a growing aquaculture industry.\n\n\"We're losing market relevance,\" he said.\n\n\"We're being displaced in all those shop windows by aquaculture products that are easier to get access to all year round.\"\n\nAustral Fisheries has an 11-boat fleet out in the Northern Prawn Fishery for tiger prawn season. (Supplied: Austral Fisheries)\n\nHe said retail prices for some prawns were as low as $15 a kilogram.\n\n\"That would match our cost of production, [but] the supermarkets have to make some money to sell this stuff, so we're selling them under our cost of production,\" he said.\n\nHe said the volatility in the wild catch could also lead to supply fluctuations, which made it challenging to provide consistency for consumers.\n\n\"We need Australian consumers to understand the amount of effort and passion we bring to bringing them fresh, wild-caught seafood that's sustainable,\" he said.\n\n\" If you want to continue to eat wild-caught seafood in Australia, we need your help. \"\n\n'Horror' banana prawn season\n\nThis tiger prawn season is coming off the back of the worst banana prawn catch in 24 years, according to Phil Robson, the Northern Fishing Fleet Manager at A Raptis & Sons.\n\n\"The banana prawn season was a horror,\" he said.\n\nThe late monsoon negatively impacted the banana prawn season. (ABC Rural: Abbey Halter)\n\n\"We end up with about a 45-tonne average, but generally I budget 100 tonnes per boat for the banana season, which is what we need to make in any given year to make money.\n\n\"Obviously, we didn't get near that this year.\"\n\nThe largest operator in the fishery, with 14 boats, Mr Robson said the late monsoon impacted the size and number of banana prawns.\n\n\"[The timing of the monsoon] is critically important,\" he said.\n\n\"Prawns are generally in close [to shore] and they need to be washed out to deeper water with the onset of the monsoon season and the rainfall [to mature].\n\nBanana prawns typically settle in rivers and are flushed into the Gulf of Carpentaria with the first downpour of the year, enabling the fishing season to open through autumn into June.\n\nDespite the disappointing year for banana prawns, Mr Robson said that because of high volumes last year, there was still an oversupply in the retail market.\n\n\"2023 was big, it was the biggest year we've had in the last five years,\" he said.\n\n\"That created pretty well double what the market could absorb.\"\n\nBut like Mr Prendergast, he was hoping for a stronger tiger prawn season to make up for some of the losses felt earlier this year.",

    "text": "Italy has cleared the way to build the world's largest suspension bridge, which would link the mainland with Sicily.\n\nThe 13.5 billion euro ($24.2 billion) infrastructure project has been long delayed by debates over its scale, earthquake threats, environmental impact, and the spectre of mafia interference.\n\nThe Strait of Messina Bridge will be \"the biggest infrastructure project in the West,\" Transport Minister Matteo Salvini told a news conference in Rome.\n\nPremier Giorgia Meloni said the bridge \"will be an engineering symbol of global significance\".\n\nMr Salvini cited studies showing the project will create 120,000 jobs a year, and accelerate growth in economically lagging southern Italy, as billions more in investments are made in roads and other infrastructure projects accompanying the bridge.\n\nMatteo Salvini says preliminary works could begin as soon as late September. (AP: Andrew Medichini)\n\nPreliminary work could begin between late September and early October, once Italy's court of audit signs off, with construction expected to start next year.\n\nDespite bureaucratic delays, the bridge is expected to be completed between 2032 and 2033, Mr Salvini said.\n\nThe Strait of Messina Bridge has been approved and cancelled multiple times since the Italian government first solicited proposals in 1969.\n\nThe Meloni administration revived the project in 2023, and this marks the furthest stage the ambitious project \u2014 first envisioned by the Romans \u2014 has ever reached.\n\n\"From a technical standpoint, it's an absolutely fascinating engineering project,'' Mr Salvini said.\n\nThe bridge would measure nearly 3.7 kilometres, with the suspended span reaching 3.3 kilometres.\n\nThat would surpass T\u00fcrkiye's \u00c7anakkale Bridge, currently the longest, by 1,277 metres.\n\nThe \u00c7anakkale Bridge was built in 2022, using an engineering design similar to the one devised for the Messina bridge.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan poses for photos at the opening ceremony of the \u00c7anakkale Bridge in 2022. (AP: Turkish Presidency)\n\nThe design includes a wing profile and a deck shape that resembles a fighter jet fuselage with openings to allow wind to pass through the structure, according to Webuild, the industrial group awarded the project.\n\nWith three car lanes in each direction flanked by a double-track railway, the bridge would have the capacity to carry 6,000 cars an hour and 200 trains a day \u2014 reducing the time to cross the strait by ferry from up to 100 minutes to 10 minutes by car.\n\nBridge could count toward NATO spending target\n\nThe project could provide a boost to Italy's commitment to raise defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP, as targeted by NATO.\n\nThe government has indicated it would classify the bridge as defence-related, helping it to meet a 1.5 per cent security component.\n\nItaly argues the bridge would form a strategic corridor for rapid troop movements and equipment deployment to NATO's southern flanks, qualifying it as a \"security-enhancing infrastructure\".\n\nMr Salvini confirmed the intention to classify the project as dual use but said it was up to Italy's defence and economic ministers.\n\nThe military classification has been criticised by a group of more than 600 professors and researchers.\n\nThey signed a letter noting that such a move would require additional assessments to see if it could withstand military use.\n\nOpponents also say the designation would potentially make the bridge a target.\n\nThe government has indicated it will classify the bridge as defence-related. (AP: Webuild/Eurolink Image Library)\n\nConcerns over organised crime\n\nThe decree that reactivated the bridge project included language giving Italy's Ministry of the Interior control over anti-mafia measures.\n\nBut the country's president insisted the project remain subject to anti-mafia legislation that applies to all large-scale infrastructure projects in Italy, out of concerns the ad hoc arrangement could weaken controls.\n\nMr Salvini pledged that keeping organised crime out of the project was a top priority, saying it would adhere to the same protocols used for the Expo 2015 World's Fair and the upcoming Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games.\n\n\"We need to pay attention so that the entire supply chain is impermeable to bad actors,'' he said.\n\nAddressing concerns about building the bridge over the Messina fault, which triggered a deadly earthquake in 1908, Webuild has emphasised that suspension bridges are structurally less vulnerable to seismic forces.\n\nIt noted that such bridges have been built in seismically active areas, including Japan, T\u00fcrkiye and California.\n\nEnvironmental groups have lodged complaints with the European Union, citing concerns the project will impact migratory birds, noting environmental studies had not demonstrated the project is a public imperative, and any environmental damage would be offset.\n\nAP",

I am all about minimising food waste. \"\n\nThe chef cooks with ingredients supplied from local farmers.

(ABC South West WA: Madigan Landry)\n\nThe chef said he hoped to see the food industry take greater action in addressing waste.\n\n\"There needs to be more skills provided to the food industry in general, there needs to be more happening when it comes to food waste,\" Mr Grothum said.\n\n\"That's why I am trying to give a bit of an insight into what is possible.\"\n\nShared solutions\n\nManjimup passionfruit grower Mitchell East supplied some of his surplus produce to the Bridgetown bakery.\n\n\"He has made passionfruit vinegar, passionfruit-infused salt \u2014 it's a good collaboration between like-minded people,\" Mr East said.\n\nMitchell East has sent some of his waste to the German baker in the past. (ABC South West: Madigan Landry)\n\nAlthough Mr East has a processing facility on his farm, the grower said there were parts of the passionfruit he could not use, so having another outlet for the excess was a valuable alternative.\n\n\"The skin can't be used by us, except for animal feed, so Will was able to take some of that from us,\" Mr East said.\n\nMitchell East makes sodas using second-grade passionfruit. (ABC South West: Madigan Landry)\n\n\"We also remove a portion of the seed when we make our cordials and sodas, and at the moment we don't have a use for [the seeds], so Will can ferment it, he can dry it.\n\n\"All these different things he can do on a small scale, but still re-harness that lost energy.\"\n\nMitchell East's passionfruit waste has been given a second life by Fallobst's owner. (ABC South West WA: Madigan Landry)\n\nMr East said he saw a great opportunity in the waste space in South West WA.\n\n\"As a farmer, you are always going to have waste; there is nothing you can do about it,\" he said.\n\n\"But if there are people who are keen to tackle food waste, there are definitely opportunities here.\"",

    "text": "A key union says it is aware of \"significant failures\" in Woodside's safety management at one of its offshore projects, days after the national regulator ordered it to suspend its decommissioning work over similar issues.\n\nThe National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) last Thursday revoked the oil and gas giant's decommissioning obligations at Griffin and Stybarrow gas fields until it completed \"essential planning and preparatory activities\".\n\nThe orders come after what NOPSEMA called \"preventable health and safety incidents\" at both sites.\n\nNOPSEMA asked BHP to decommission both gas fields in 2021, a year before its petroleum arm was bought by Woodside.\n\nDecommissioning refers to the process of safely closing a mine or oil and gas site, with the expectation that the impacted environment will be rehabilitated afterwards.\n\nIn May, 16,000 litres of oil spilled into the ocean during removal operations at Woodside's Griffin oil and gas field, which NOPSEMA said had the potential to expose workers to hydrogen sulphide.\n\nNOPSEMA investigated an oil spill at Griffin earlier this year, around 60km from the Ningaloo Reef. (Supplied: Nick Thake)\n\nMeanwhile, the regulator said there had been unsuccessful recovery attempts and the presence of hydrates in some infrastructure at Stybarrow.\n\nA Woodside spokesperson said the company had made substantial progress towards decommissioning the Stybarrow, Griffin and Minerva fields, concluding a multi-year decommissioning program.\n\n\"Across the campaign, more than 25,000 tonnes of infrastructure, including over 140 kilometres of pipe and 100 subsea structures, have been brought to shore to enable recycling and reuse,\" it said.\n\nA Woodside spokesperson said NOPSEMA's revised general directions provided additional time and clarity for essential planning and preparatory activities.\n\nCalls to overhaul safety\n\nThe regulator's directions were welcomed by Maritime Union of Australia organiser Doug Heath, who has sent the regulator a deluge of reports about \"near misses\" at Woodside's decommissioning projects.\n\nHe told the ABC that \"a fundamental breach\" had occurred at one of Woodside's offshore projects just this week.\n\nDoug Heath says Woodside's safety culture has worsened since the death of an employee at North Rankin. (Supplied)\n\n\"We've had a series of incidents where workers have suffered, in one case a punctured lung,\" Mr Heath said.\n\n\"In other cases, there have been a series of near misses.\"\n\nIn March, NOPSEMA confirmed it was investigating lifting and crane operations at McDermott's DLV 2000 vessel, which has been decommissioning the Stybarrow gas field.\n\n\"The consequence of those rigging failures on the Woodside projects means a potential fatality,\" Mr Heath said.\n\nTwo years ago, Woodside contractor Michael Jurman died while working at the North Rankin offshore facility, an incident that NOPSEMA is still investigating.\n\nSince then, Woodside's health and safety data showed the number of high-potential incidents and total recordable injuries had increased.\n\nMr Heath said the company had not learned its lesson.\n\n\"If they need the regulator to tell them that they're not doing a good enough job, they've got some significant failures within their HSC management,\" he said.\n\nWoodside says all Enfield, Stybarrow, Minerva and Griffin wells are permanently plugged. (ABC News: Armin Azad)\n\n\"[Woodside is] doing more decommissioning work than probably any other oil and gas company in WA, but their standards have slipped over the course of time.\n\n\" I'm not sure what it's going to take for Woodside to actually learn from the abundance of evidence that's come to light over the last couple of years about their substandard safety. \"\n\nA Woodside spokesperson said safety always had been and would continue to be its priority, and it was continuously taking action to strengthen its safety culture.",

    "text": "Deep in the Queensland outback, families are living in caravans as they try to rebuild their homes four months after catastrophic flooding.\n\nStanding in the mud-strewn shell of her home, Megan Riley finds it difficult to talk about it.\n\nThe floodwater reached the second level of Megan Riley's home. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\n\"It's bloody hard, puts you in tears,\" she said.\n\nIn April, the entire population of Thargomindah was evacuated to an airstrip as they watched a temporary levee break and a torrent of water swallow the town.\n\nOut of more than 100 houses, only 12 were left unscathed.\n\nLoading...\n\nMs Riley was one of the last people to return to her newly renovated home.\n\nShe found it ruined.\n\n\"As soon as I opened the door, I knew it was all gone \u2026 it was heartbreaking,\" Ms Riley said.\n\nFour months on, she is living in one of 32 caravans provided by the council and state government.\n\nMegan Riley's house was destroyed by floodwater. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\nHer house, which belonged to her grandparents, will have to be knocked down.\n\nBut rather than rebuild, Ms Riley said she would truck in a relocatable house.\n\n\"The price of getting a builder out here and materials to do so is just exorbitant because of the distance,\" she said.\n\n\"The plan is to lift the new house out of the flood line and not experience anything like this again.\"\n\nRebuilding costly\n\nLocal tradesman Geoff Pike runs the only trade services company in Thargomindah and has been working non-stop to rebuild the town since the flood.\n\nGeoff Pike says building in Thargomindah costs double what it does in Brisbane. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\n\"We've been slammed \u2026 it's been full on,\" he said.\n\nMr Pike said compared to Brisbane, it generally costs about double to build in Thargomindah due to the cost of getting materials to the site.\n\n\"You're adding 1,000 kilometres, and it's generally an empty truck on the way back,\" he said.\n\nThe floodwater left behind mud-clogged equipment at Geoff Pike's trade services business. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\nBut Mr Pike said it was not a lack of supplies that was slowing down the town's recovery \u2014 it was a critical shortage of accommodation.\n\n\"We're a long way short from being able to provide the army of people we want,\" he said.\n\nTo help, Mr Pike has coordinated a transportable work camp to be trucked to Thargomindah from Brisbane.\n\nHe said it would accommodate around 18 workers and significantly speed up the town's rebuild.\n\n\"We're trying to get in front of that curve and get people into houses before summer hits,\" Mr Pike said.\n\nModular homes popular\n\nQueensland's peak building sector body Master Builders said prefabricated and modular houses were becoming more common in rural areas.\n\nGeneral manager of policy and advocacy Dyan Johnson said modular homes could help \"plug the gap\" in traditional construction in the bush.\n\nDozens of families are still living in caravans months after Thargomindah flooded. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\n\"It really does fit that need of being able to meet \u2026 labour and supply challenges because you can centralise your construction a lot more,\" she said.\n\n\"If there are not enough trades on the ground, if it is too difficult and time-constrained to get the supplies out there, modular can be a solution.\"\n\nThargomindah is situated in the south-west corner of Queensland. (ABC News: Sharon Gordon/Supplied: Daniel Roy)\n\nBulloo Shire Council purchases one transportable house a year to increase housing supply in Thargomindah, costing around $700,000.\n\nMayor John \"Tractor\" Ferguson estimated a house built from scratch would cost close to $1 million to construct, but would be worth less than $200,000 when complete.\n\n\"The biggest problem here is all the on-costs: your tradies have got to get here, then they've got to stop here, then you've got freight, and your concrete is so much dearer out here,\" he said.\n\n\"Bringing all that stuff out, it nearly doubles the price of the house.\"\n\nBuilding community\n\nIn a town without many tradespeople, residents had rolled up their sleeves and gotten to work restoring local businesses.\n\nMotel owner Paul Sparks said he did not have a clue where to start when he saw the extent of the flood damage to his business.\n\nPaul Sparks points out the height of the floodwater in April. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura)\n\n\"We needed new carpets, to rip the floors out, rip the walls out, all the furniture was wrecked, the vanities, the cupboards,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought we were just going to go bankrupt.\"\n\nIt makes Mr Sparks emotional to remember the weeks following, when friends, family, neighbours, even strangers, gathered to clean up the motel.\n\nPaul Sparks says everything in his hotel rooms has needed replacing due to the flood damage. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\n\"The police officers helped pull the beds out and load skips \u2026 a young couple helped rip the carpets out \u2026 they were such a great help,\" he said.\n\n\"The help and the community getting together was fantastic \u2014 it's been pretty overwhelming.\"",

    "text": "Trump has said he is considering four contenders for the position of the Fed\u2019s chair, which will open up in May next year when the term of the current chair, Jerome Powell, who Trump detests and attacks relentlessly and viciously, will end. Hassett, current governor Christopher Waller and former governor Kevin Warsh are thought to be on his short list. He is weighing up whether to announce a short-term appointment \u2013 someone who would fill the position until the term expires on January 31 next year \u2013 or appointing a \u201cchair elect\u201d who will succeed Powell when his term as chair ends next May. It\u2019s a pivotal decision because the Kugler position might be the only opportunity he has to inject a loyalist into the Fed boardroom during this term. Powell\u2019s chairmanship might end in May but, should he choose to remain on the board, his term as a governor runs until 2028. There are no other scheduled retirements during the Trump presidency. Federal Reserve Board governor Adriana Kugler\u2019s unexpected resignation opens the door for Trump to tighten his grip on the Fed. Credit: AP There are reports that Trump\u2019s advisers (which include unusual names, like Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity and MAGA heavyweight Steve Bannon) are urging him to appoint someone who will occupy the seat only until January, giving him more time to decide on Powell\u2019s replacement.\n\nTrump could appoint someone designated as Powell\u2019s successor, hoping that a \u201cshadow\u201d chair would undermine Powell and Powell\u2019s messaging both within and outside the Fed\u2019s boardroom. The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (who has withdrawn himself from contention for the role), mooted exactly that strategy ahead of last year\u2019s US election. Whether the appointment is short term or unveils Powell\u2019s successor, however, the new governor would be one of only two Trump-appointed members on the seven-member board and the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee that actually decides US monetary policies. The other is the Fed\u2019s deputy chair, Michelle Bowman. Loading While Trump has made it very clear what he wants from the next Fed chair, it is less obvious what qualifications, other than loyalty, Trump wants from the incoming BLS commissioner. The blueprint for this administration \u2013 \u201cProject 2025\u201d \u2013 recommended appointing political appointees to the Labor department, within which the BLS sits, and consolidating the BLS with other data collecting agencies into a \u201cmore manageable\u201d mega statistical agency.\n\nThe BLS could do with a (non-political) overhaul. It has a challenge with its current data surveys because, post-COVID, the response rates from businesses have dropped significantly. That\u2019s part of the explanation for why its revisions of June quarter data, which showed a major fall in jobs generation, were so large. The decisions could have a significant impact on America\u2019s interest rates and economy. Credit: Bloomberg Even as it has become harder for the bureau to collect accurate data, it has experienced a reduction in its resources in recent years that is being compounded by job losses and an 8 per cent cut to next year\u2019s budget because of Trump\u2019s assault on the US bureaucracy. If its data is to be made more reliable and credible, it needs more, not fewer, resources and someone \u2013 like Kugler \u2013 who is non-partisan and clearly qualified as its head. If Trump appoints a loyalist, it would cast a shadow over the accuracy of data central to the markets and businesses\u2019 understanding of economic conditions and probably lead to an increase in risk premia in US interest rates.\n\nThe ironic aspect of Trump\u2019s response to the weak employment data is that it actually strengthens the case for a rate cut. The Fed has a dual mandate, charged with maximising employment and price stability. It has kept rates on hold while it waits to see the effects of Trump\u2019s trade policies on an inflation rate that, at 2.7 per cent, is already above its target of 2 per cent. The two appointments to critical economic agencies have the potential to undermine the credibility of the Fed\u2019s policy decisions and the BLS\u2019s data if financial market participants and businesses suspect that the Fed\u2019s decisions and the BLS\u2019s data have been tainted by political influences. The inflation rate has been edging up even before the full effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs have had time to reveal themselves, but the economy has slowed markedly and the BLS data shows the unemployment rate is edging up even as the job market shrinks and salaries stagnate. Where, before that data, the odds were against a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting next month, they \u2013 and an increasing number of Fed governors \u2013 now favour a rate cut.\n\nInstead of accusing (without any evidence) the BLS of manipulating its date to make his economic management look bad, Trump should have seized on it to proclaim that he was right, and the Fed wrong, on the need for a rate cut. Trump can probably cause conflicts and dysfunction within the Fed and the BLS if that is his objective with the appointments he makes. Whether that achieves his broader ambitions, however, is another matter. Even if he could stack the Fed board with loyalists, which he can\u2019t, or intimidate the majority of the Open Market Committee, which is unlikely, the Fed can only influence US short term rates. The federal funds rate anchors the bond market\u2019s yield curve, but longer term rates are set by the market itself.\n\nIf investors thought the Fed\u2019s decision-making had been politicised, they would demand higher yields to compensate for the increased risk of inflation and increase the premium required for holding longer-term bonds. Loading The yield curve would steepen, and it is those yields at the longer end of the curve that determine the rates on mortgage and car loans and business\u2019 interest costs. It is the Fed\u2019s credibility as an independent, apolitical agency that will contain inflation that gives it a broader influence over the curve than just the federal funds rate. Similarly, if the BLS data is regarded as tainted and unreliable, it will inject uncertainty and caution into businesses\u2019 decision-making and probably lead to less employment and investment.",

But of the dozen companies that have signed up to the deal inked by the association with the support of the AMWU and Labor, at least half are facing questions about their business practices, including one company, Fredon Air, run by a former bankrupt, and another, Emax Air, that is a defendant in criminal proceedings. Ohlback, a HVAC association director, owes creditors $613,138 according to the February liquidators\u2019 report for his former company, Precision Air Services. His business partner, Smith, who continued as a director after Ohlback resigned in January 2023, owes $1.2 million. Liquidator Michael Jones found the company may have been trading while insolvent since June 30, 2022, due to \u201csignificant losses from government projects\u201d and the \u201cprolonged impact of COVID-19\u2033. But in April that year, Precision Air Services was plastered all over Gavin Ohlback Racing\u2019s car in the Australian Midget Championship, also known as speedcar, as it chased the national speedway championship.\n\n\u201cWhilst the team spends plenty of time in the shed making sure the cars fast, they also ensure the car is presented in the best possible fashion,\u201d Ohlback wrote on Facebook in February 2022. HVAC association director Gavin Ohlback\u2019s midget (speedcar) car racing team. Credit: Facebook The Ohlbacks sold their six-bedroom home in Kenthurst, in Sydney\u2019s north-west, in 2016 for $4 million. Then they bought the house next door for $2.05 million and a 5-bedroom home in Cattai for $2.9 million. In 2021, they submitted plans for a $96,000 extension of the Cattai home, including a new garage and a pool and spa, complete with rugby league goal posts out front. By March 2024, Precision Air Services had assets of $75 in its bank, according to Jones, after it paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans to Ohlback and Smith. The pair then set up another company, S&A Solutions, which signed onto the AMWU deal. Ohlback did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cI may be forced to commence legal actions for the recovery of those amounts,\u201d Jones said in his report to creditors in February.\n\nFellow HVAC association founder Sergio Gonzalez built a full-size enclosed futsal pitch with artificial turf in his front yard in Denham Court, while his Sublime air-conditioning companies have gone through three liquidations and accrued debts to the tax office and creditors of more than $2 million. But liquidators said recouping those debts would be a challenge because Gonzalez has no real property holdings to his name. Property records show the six-bedroom mansion in Denham Court, which has undergone extensive renovations in recent years, is registered in his wife\u2019s name, Romina Gonzalez. Sergio Gonzalez\u2019s home in Denham Court, complete with futsal pitch.

Gonzalez fell out with other HVAC association founders in October after accusing them of doing a deal with the AMWU \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d. He resigned as a director of the association and transferred his workers to an agreement with the Plumbers Union.\n\nThe split sparked a series of claims and counterclaims after the HVAC association accused the Plumbers Union of intimidating builders into joining their enterprise bargaining agreement. The Plumbers Union accused the HVAC association of attempting to rope in other firms into the multi-employer deal that would have no power over the negotiations. Gonzalez told The Australian Financial Review in October that he had not seen the HVAC deal before he was asked to sign on. \u201cThey said we\u2019re going to do it, and you\u2019re going to be part of it.\u201d Sergio Gonzalez and Fair Trading Minister Anoulack Chanthivong (second and third from right) at Westmead Health Precinct in May.

Fair Trading Minister Anoulack Chanthivong attended a ducting installation with Gonzalez at Westmead Health Precinct in May. Gonzalez, who did not respond to requests for comment, previously ran labour hire company Sublime Onsite, which also went into liquidation in 2018. Beecroft, another HVAC association director, has failed multiple payment plans with the ATO and faces a claim of trading while insolvent for at least five years. His former company, Traminer Industries, owed $158,155 to the ATO when it was liquidated in 2019. His most recent company, Traminer Industries (NSW), owed $593,000 to the tax office, according to a restructuring proposal submitted to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission in July.\n\nDarren Beecroft called for US-style immigration raids on social media. Credit: Facebook Beecroft said the debts had all been sorted through a new small business payment plan. \u201cI\u2019m all good,\u201d he said. \u201cI pay every one of my guys exactly what the agreement says.\u201d In June, Beecroft suggested immigration officials should raid Australian construction sites after US President Donald Trump ordered immigration officials to target Mexican and South American workers on construction sites. \u201cMaybe we need to do this in Australian work sites,\u201d he said on Facebook alongside a video of migrant workers being arrested.\n\nBeecroft has also accused gender diverse people of having a mental illness, suggested climate change was a scam, labelled activist Greta Thunberg a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d and re-posted a meme accusing \u201cwoke parents\u201d of cutting their kids\u2019 \u201cnuts off\u201d. Beecroft said he stood by his personal views \u201c100 per cent\u201d. The HVAC association\u2019s spokesman and leader, Mimmo Scavera, said in October that the association was planning to \u201crope in\u201d a further six companies in the sector into the AMWU deal despite resistance from the Plumbers Union and the Australian Industry Group. Scavera praised the deal for allowing the companies to pool resources among their 600 employees to work on multiple sites under the same conditions. HVAC Manufacturing and Installation Association spokesman Mimmo Scavera. Credit: Louie Douvis But Scavera has also faced difficulties after being accused by a former employee in the Fair Work Commission in 2016 of wage underpayment, bullying and unfair termination of his employment. Scavera denied the allegations. The commission recommended that the employee take his case to the Fair Work Ombudsman.\n\nThe deal has also been under scrutiny from critics, including the Business Council of Australia, which claimed in a submission to parliament in November that workers under the HVAC multi-employer agreement would be $1.27 worse off per hour compared to the Plumbers Union deal with single employers by 2027. The AMWU said last year the deal would increase the annual pay of air-conditioning installation workers from $102,000 to $133,000 over the life of the agreement. Innes Willox, the Australian Industry Group\u2019s chief executive, said a group of companies could use multi-employer bargaining to push smaller competitors out of the market who could not compete for employees. \u201cThe great fear has always been that multi-party bargaining can be used for essentially anticompetitive purposes, to drive out competition within a marketplace, which then drives up rates in the end for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe flip side of the coin is that it has the potential to drive businesses to the wall. It takes away the ability of businesses to manage their individual business in the way and form that they see is the best fit for their business.\u201d",

    "text": "It will be \u201cthe biggest infrastructure project in the West\u201d, he said, after a government committee with oversight of strategic public investments approved the project. Loading It will also help Italy reach the increased 5 per cent defence spending targets that the Trump administration has long demanded of its NATO allies. Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government has indicated that it will classify the Messina bridge as a strategic investment, which will help bump up its current defence spending, which stands at less than 2 per cent of its GDP. The government has argued that the bridge would strengthen Europe\u2019s defences by facilitating easier troop movements to military bases in Sicily, part of NATO\u2019s southern flank. Preliminary work and geological surveys are due to begin in the autumn, with construction expected to start next year. The bridge is due to be completed by 2032 or 2033.\n\nThe project would create 120,000 jobs a year and billions of euros would be invested in new roads, railway stations and other related infrastructure, Salvini said. Addressing worries that the \u2019Ndrangheta and Cosa Nostra would be rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of skimming off billions of euros in government funding, he said there would be vigilance \u201c24 hours a day\u201d against mafia infiltration. The bridge is due to be completed by 2032 or 2033. Credit: AP The government would employ the same anti-mafia precautions that had been used for other lucrative infrastructure projects, such as the World\u2019s Fair in Milan in 2015 and next year\u2019s Winter Olympics, which will be held in Milan and the Alpine resort of Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo. \u201cWe have to watch the whole supply chain so that it is impervious to bad-intentioned people,\u201d said Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister and head of the League, one of three parties in Meloni\u2019s coalition government.\n\nTrains and vehicles currently have to cross the strait on ferries, with railway carriages laboriously transferred to the boats. Once the bridge is built, up to 6000 cars an hour will be able to cross, as well as 200 trains a day. The journey time by car will be cut from an hour to just 10 minutes. Aside from mafia infiltration and seismic instability, critics point out that Sicily and Calabria are among Italy\u2019s poorest regions, with pot-holed roads, understaffed hospitals, crumbling schools and woeful public transport. They say it would be far better to use the billions of euros to improve basic services. The project \u201crepresents the greatest waste of public money ever seen in Italy\u201d, said Angelo Bonelli, an MP from the Greens and Left Alliance.\n\nIt was an arrogant vanity project by Salvini that would throw \u201cbillions of euros into concrete and propaganda\u201d, he said. He claimed one of the pylons for the bridge would stand on an \u201cactive fault line\u201d. Trains and vehicles currently have to cross the strait on ferries, with railway carriages laboriously transferred to the boats. Credit: AP Nicola Fratoianni, an MP from the same party, said the project would suck up billions in public funds and risks \u201cturning into a gigantic black hole\u201d. The centre-Left Democrats, Italy\u2019s main opposition party, said the project \u201ctramples environmental, safety and European norms \u2013 and common sense\u201d.\n\nAnthony Barbagallo, one of its MPs, said the project would be \u201ca colossal waste of public resources\u201d and a \u201cmonument to Salvini\u2019s propaganda\u201d. The real priorities of the impoverished south were public transport, improved health services and better schools, he said. The prime minister said building the bridge would not be easy, but it would be a valuable investment in \u201cItaly\u2019s present and its future\u201d. The scale of the project was \u201cas impressive as it is cutting-edge from a technical and engineering point of view\u201d, Meloni said. The mega project has been awarded to a consortium led by Webuild, an Italian infrastructure group.",

No fuss, no fireworks. Just the quiet confirmation that there won\u2019t be another novel from Peter Carey \u2013 the only Australian to win the Booker Prize twice, and one of only a handful to win the Miles Franklin three times. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d stopped. I had a fear that I might have written all the novels I needed or should write,\u201d Carey, 82, says. \u201cBut I persisted, and tried various things, and threw things away \u2026 and in the end I thought, well, that\u2019s it.\u201d Peter Carey in New York, where he has lived now for 35 years. Credit: Idris Solomon The boy from Bacchus Marsh became a literary giant, showing Australians a funhouse mirror version of their own history \u2013 grotesque, funny, violent, and absurd \u2013 and carrying that vision to the world. There have been 14 novels \u2013 including Illywhacker, Oscar and Lucinda, True History of the Kelly Gang, Theft: A Love Story and The Chemistry of Tears \u2013 two volumes of short stories, and two travelogues. Books full of mythmakers and tricksters, schemers and fabulists, each one animated by Carey\u2019s unmistakable voice \u2013 sly, digressive, electric with curiosity. He emerged alongside a transformative generation of Australian writers, but carved a path all his own, refusing to conform, mixing high style with larrikinism, postmodern and postcolonial play with emotional heft. And for decades, the rhythm never faltered. Every few years, like clockwork, a new Carey novel. Then it stopped \u2013 and the silence started to feel pointed. Asking a writer how their next novel is going is like asking a magician how the trick works: awkward, disappointing, and you\u2019re probably not going to get an invitation back. Now, the question has answered itself. Carey\u2019s last novel, A Long Way from Home, was published nearly eight years ago, and he sees it as standing tall among his most meaningful books. It marked a turning point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Carey in 2001 when he won the Booker Prize for the second time for True History of the Kelly Gang. Credit: AP \u201cThere\u2019s a time when you\u2019re new to everybody \u2013 you do something like Oscar and Lucinda or Illywhacker, and you get hugely noticed. The Kelly Gang, also,\u201d Carey says. \u201cBut A Long Way from Home, which, I think, is as important a thing as I\u2019ve done\u2026 it doesn\u2019t sit like that. No one particularly thinks of it as the best thing he\u2019s ever done or the most important thing. But I thought it was.\u201d The novel follows a 1950s car race across Australia, but beneath the bonnet is something more volatile: an attempt to grapple with the country\u2019s foundational violence, its settler legacy. Carey has long circled Australia\u2019s history and national mythology, but in A Long Way from Home, he took it on directly. He wanted to write, as a white Australian, about imperialism and invasion. It felt risky, and he was nervous about how it would land, particularly when he returned to Australia to tour the book. But he felt he pulled it off \u2013 or, as he puts it, \u201cI didn\u2019t make a dick of myself.\u201d Carey isn\u2019t expecting an orchestra of tiny violins to start playing. There appears to be a straightforward, if perhaps melancholic, acceptance: the more you publish, the less of a fuss it makes. His good friend Tom Keneally once told him that when they were new, everyone thought they were brilliant \u2013 now, they\u2019re just part of the furniture. Peter Carey\u2019s notebooks for True History of the Kelly Gang, on display at the State Library Victoria. Credit: Eugene Hyland \u201cI think it\u2019s true. We all know that from our reading, and from how it feels to discover a writer,\u201d Carey says. \u201cWe tend to be less excited about the third or fourth book, but we were absolutely stunned by the first. That\u2019s the way it goes \u2026 You have to know when it\u2019s enough, too.\u201d As we talk, a bookshelf packed with Carey\u2019s novels watches over us. This year marks 35 years since he left Australia for New York \u2013 much longer than he ever planned to stay away. He moved there with his second wife, Alison Summers, a theatre-maker and editor, and they had two sons. The marriage ended, but he stayed. Carey says Australians tend to get anxious or angry about those who leave, but he says his thinking and writing have always looked back to home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, his old novels were scattered around the Manhattan apartment he shares with his wife, Frances Coady, a book editor and publisher turned agent. After returning from the A Long Way from Home tour, he finally corralled them onto shelves. In front of them, Carey made several attempts at a new novel \u2013 two, maybe three, different starts, each hundreds of pages long \u2013 but nothing stuck. There was no urgency behind them, no force demanding the work into being. After A Long Way from Home, the compulsion just wasn\u2019t there. Peter Carey photographed in the 1970s. Credit: Ray Lawrence \u201cAfter a while, you develop a lot of skills \u2013 you can make things work. But the last thing you want to do is bullshit yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to ask, do you need to write this? Why are you rewriting and rewriting and rewriting? Because you\u2019re trying to find something that isn\u2019t there. And that\u2019s OK. I mean, I\u2019m 82 years old, for f---\u2019s sake.\u201d There was no ceremonial uncapping of the pen, no dramatic farewell to fiction. Certainly no relief, he says he didn\u2019t feel happy about it. It\u2019s been about five years now, he guesses, since he called it a day. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people \u2013 this is what I do. And when you can\u2019t do that any more\u2026 who are you?\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t even play golf. I\u2019m certainly not going sailing. In the end, you\u2019re someone who could do one trick \u2013 and that\u2019s write.\u201d Peter Carey photographed at his New York home in 2009. Credit: Keke Keukelaar And that one trick hasn\u2019t disappeared. Carey\u2019s now working on a non-fiction project \u2013 \u201cenough to keep me off the street,\u201d as he puts it \u2013 and while it\u2019s a different muscle from fiction, it still scratches an itch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m engaged in making something and it\u2019s a little risky, and it\u2019s beyond what I think I know how to do, and that\u2019s exciting, right?\u201d The past few years have brought other big changes, too. For nearly two decades, Carey was a distinguished professor and the executive director of the creative writing MFA at public university Hunter College, a program he helped build into one of the country\u2019s best, and most competitive courses. Former alumni include Susan Choi, Jennifer Egan, Paul Beatty and Adam Haslett. He left a few years ago. He laughs about the creeping signs of age: forgetting book titles when talking to students, stretching sentences to give himself time to remember. He won\u2019t be drawn on the details, but it doesn\u2019t sound as though it was the fondest farewell. \u201cThere were ... let\u2019s call them administrative issues, shall we? That went on for a couple of years. I resolved them. But I didn\u2019t want to deal with any of that ever again,\u201d he says. Those professional shifts come amid a milestone year for Carey: the 25th anniversary of True History of the Kelly Gang, the swaggering Booker-winning novel written in the unpunctuated voice of Australia\u2019s most infamous outlaw. Peter Carey pictured in 1994. Carey is one of five Australian artists commissioned by the State Library of Victoria to contribute to Creative Acts, a new exhibition showcasing 600 artefacts from the library\u2019s collection, all exploring the theme of creativity. His piece \u2013 a reflection on the 1000 days he spent writing True History of the Kelly Gang \u2013 draws on the personal archive he\u2019s contributed over the years, including 4000 pages of drafts, marked-up manuscripts, and the chunky 1990s Apple computer he used to write the novel. He\u2019s been selling archival material for some time \u2013 \u201cevery time I need to pay the school fees,\u201d he jokes. Some of it won\u2019t be unsealed until after his death. Asked if there\u2019s anything particularly juicy in there, he shoots back: \u201cOh, I mean, if I was going to pay back somebody, I\u2019d rather do it while I was alive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe origin story of True History of the Kelly Gang is almost mythic in itself. Carey, whose parents ran a car dealership in Ballarat and scraped together the funds to send him to Geelong Grammar, flunked his first-year science exams at Monash University. He\u2019d once imagined himself a chemist or a zoologist \u2013 until a car crash and some existential drift nudged him into advertising. There, among copywriters who harboured secret literary ambitions, he was introduced to James Joyce, Graham Greene, Jack Kerouac and William Faulkner. One day, his colleague Barry Oakley \u2013 a former schoolteacher and writer \u2013 took him to George\u2019s Art Gallery to see Sidney Nolan\u2019s Ned Kelly paintings. Carey was entranced. He sought out Ned Kelly: Australian Son by Max Brown, and became fixated on the Jerilderie letter, Kelly\u2019s \u201cmanifesto\u201d, dictated as a defence against what he saw as the relentless persecution from the colonial establishment. Carey transcribed the letter by hand and carried it around \u201clike the relic of a martyred saint\u201d, certain he would one day do something with it. Years passed. There were false starts and failed novels, then critical successes. The letter was lost somewhere along the way. But in 1994, at the age of 51, Carey wandered into the Met in New York and stumbled across Nolan\u2019s full suite of 27 Kelly paintings. The vision returned \u2013 and this time, he started writing. Peter Carey has now turned his attention to writing a work of non-fiction. Credit: Ben Sklar \u201cIt feels like yesterday really. Well, not quite, but 25 years is sort of shocking. I mean, shit,\u201d he says. The novel was a critical and commercial success, winning the Booker Prize and the Commonwealth Writers\u2019 Prize and inspiring film adaptations. Yet Carey thinks the final product was very different from what the young man who first dreamt it expected. That writer wanted to go off the deep end of the avant-garde. \u201cThat writer would have thought I was a total sellout. That writer was ridiculous, but charming in his way. But the Kelly Gang was not what he had in mind, and that came slowly over time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "When artist Stephen Cornwell first started making digital art, it was exciting and new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I realised how messy paint was, and that I could travel with my artwork without having oil paints,\" Cornwell told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the graphic design and photo editing software Photoshop, Cornwell would spend months labouring over a single image. His hard work paid off, and in 2021 he was nominated for the prestigious Blake Prize.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut today, Cornwell fears his work is becoming impossible to tell apart from generative AI. He says these days making digital art is a \"lost cause\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's assumed everything I do is AI,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Any school-age kid can use [generative AI] and get extraordinary results. But the results are built on the backbone of those who originally created the work themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's theft.\"\n\n\n\nArtist Stephen Cornwell's image Angel-Fish was created without the use of artificial intelligence. Source: Supplied / Stephen Cornwell\n\nWhat is the Productivity Commission proposing?\n\nCornwell has concerns about a proposal by a government body to scale back copyright laws so that content can be fed into AI models without compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interim report from the Productivity Commission has proposed that big tech companies have greater access to work such as that of Cornwell's, and other Australian creative professionals, in the form of datasets to train AI models.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtists, especially those working with digital technology, say that artificial intelligence devalues their art and that the proposed changes would make it even harder to earn a living.\n\n\n\nFederal Treasurer Jim Chalmers says harnessing artificial intelligence can provide a huge boost to the Australian economy. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch The recommendation is part of the Commission's proposed roadmap to \"harnessing data and the digital economy\". It suggests the Copyright Act could be amended so that content \u2014 such as videos, images and music \u2014 can be mined without permission or compensation under \"fair dealing\" provisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the current law, \"fair dealing\" exceptions apply to copyrighted material that is used for things such as research or study, parody or satire, or reporting the news. Exceptions for text and data mining under \"fair dealing\" are in place in countries such as the United Kingdom and also the European Union.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interim report also recommends the government re-think plans to put mandatory guardrails on high-risk AI, and that AI-specific regulation should be used as a last resort.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt estimates that AI could provide a $116 billion boost to Australia\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\n'Making infringement legal'\n\nLouise Buckingham, CEO of Community Legal Centre Arts Law, is concerned the proposed change is a \"get out of jail free card\" for wealthy tech companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Productivity Commission\u2019s recommendation is all about recognising infringement is incurring and making it legal rather than enforcing it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBuckingham said more artists are coming to the centre with concerns that AI is making it harder to make a living in the arts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s not just about what someone can sell their work for its about what someone can be employed for, and how much they can invest,\" she said.\n\n\n\nNicola Grayson, head of public affairs at Creative Australia, said AI, and in particular generative AI, is the \"big disruptor in the cultural and creative sector\".\n\n\n\n\n\nGrayson said copyright law in Australia was robust and policymakers should be looking to enforce it rather than walk it back.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative Australia made a submission to the report and Grayson says it will be following up with the Productivity Commission and the tech sector to make sure everyone is benefiting from AI.\n\n\n\n'Realistic' about AI risks\n\nThe interim report was released ahead of Treasurer Jim Chalmers\u2019 economic reform round table later this month, which is seeking ways to boost the country\u2019s productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Chalmers told a press conference that he is: \"optimistic that AI can be a force for good, but I\u2019m also realistic about the risks\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to ABC News Breakfast on Wednesday, Industry and Science Minister Tim Ayres said the government has \"no plans to make changes\" in relation to Australian copyright law.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Anthony Albanese announces new move to tackle Australia's productivity problem\n\nMeanwhile, Opposition leader Sussan Ley said she is concerned about the report\u2019s lack of \"guardrails to prevent big tech stealing the hard-earned products of our content creators\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is not appropriate for big tech to steal the work of Australian artists, musicians, creators, news media, journalism, and use it for their own ends without paying for it,\" she said on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Productivity Commission is asking for feedback before it releases its final recommendations later in the year.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile many people may think of slavery as a thing of the past, more people are living in slavery today than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile large companies in Australia are required to report on how they're addressing modern slavery risks in supply chains, there are no real penalties for inaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, an organisation of Uyghur women are taking matters into their own hands by launching legal action against major retailer Kmart.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group says they have a reasonable belief that Kmart is sourcing some products from supply chains linked to forced Uyghur forced labour camps.\n\n\n\n\n\nKmart denies this.\n\n\n\n\n\nJen Kanis, Principal Lawyer at Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, is representing the Uyghur group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We filed a legal action in the federal court to determine if Kmart has engaged in misleading conduct about the use of forced labou r in their supply chain. And the reason why we've done that is because our client is concerned that Kmart is engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to what they say about their ethical sourcing claims.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Kmart say they have in place an Ethical Sourcing Program, which helps to identify and mitigate modern slavery risks, including the risk of forced labour.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with allegations of credible links made between their listed suppliers and factories linked to forced Uyghur labour, the legal action is calling on Kmart to share documents clarifying the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nRamila Chanisheff is the President of the Australian Uyghur Tangritagh Women\u2019s Association, the group filing the legal action.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that Kmart and other major retailers need to be transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ultimate aim is to know that Kmart doesn't engage with supply chains that have Uyghur forced labour or any slave labour. And that also goes obviously for other industries as well. Now Australia, it's illegal to have modern day slavery in Australia, and yet we find that the government legislations and laws in place are not strict enough. Are not strong enough to hold industries to account, and this is where it falls short, I think. We can prove or we can say, and we can provide credible evidence that could be or to force labour and supply chains, but if the government doesn't take it to the next level, it seems that industries are getting away with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Uyghur people are a majority Muslim, Turkic-speaking, ethnic minority living in an area of north-west China known officially as the Uyghur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, or East Turkestan to its Uyghur population.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2017, it's estimated that Chinese authorities have arrested over one million Uyghur people from the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chinese Government then detains them in what officials call re-education camps... but which some experts on the matter describe as more akin to concentration camps.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe involuntary transfers and forced labour of Uyghur people are well documented, enforced by Chinese officials under the guise of vocational training and poverty alleviation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Chanisheff says every person in the Uyghur community has either immediate or extended family taken to camps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All of us have been affected in some way, whether it is like our close relatives or secondary relatives or family or friends. All of us have been affected in some way when these people, those who have been taken into the concentration camps, there wouldn't be any communication with them, whatsoever. But the communication that does happen are those who are obviously left outside and we do have people in the community and are able to contact them through WeChat, which is a Chinese government communication tool, which is heavily monitored.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people in the camps are arrested without charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the reasons given for their detention include attending services at the Mosque, sending texts containing Quranic verses, and wearing religious attire.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to mass arrests and surveillance, it's reported that Uyghur people are frequently subjected to forced sterilisation, sexual violence, separation of families, and torture.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile data on the matter is scarce due to a lack of transparency from the Chinese Government, it's believed that tens of thousands of Uyghurs have been shipped throughout mainland China to work, without pay, in factories.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chinese Government denies these claims.\n\n\n\n\n\nFreya Dinshaw is the associate legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, which is also representing the Uyghur group.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says Australia has a serious problem with forced labour entering the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're obviously all connected by the clothes we wear and the things we buy. And it's estimated that $27 billion worth of goods that are at high risk of being made with forced labour are imported into Australia every year. So this problem is only increasing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the Modern Slavery Act only requires companies to report on actions to address risks of forced labour in supply chains.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the U-S, which says China's treatment of the Uyghur people amounts to genocide, Australia does not ban the import of products made in Xinjiang province, instead relying on a policy of transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\nFreya Dinshaw saysthe Modern Slavery Act is not strong enough and must demand stronger corporate accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Australian Modern Slavery Act should be about protecting the people who put the clothes on our back, who pick the food that we eat and make the goods that we all consume. Yet it is a fairly weak piece of legislation in terms of only requiring reporting and not going further to require action by companies. So there's an urgent need to ensure that Australian companies have a duty to prevent modern slavery so that they're legally required to investigate and address modern slavery in their supply chains and face hard if they don't. And Australia should also follow the lead of other countries like Canada and the US and banned goods made with forced labor from ending up on our shop shelves so that we can all be confident that the clothes we wear and the things we have aren't made at the expense of someone else's freedom.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, through the legal action, it is revealed that Kmart is knowingly sourcing products from factories with links to forced labor, they could then be found to have engaged in misleading marketing by advertising ethical sourcing of all its products.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is the case, however, they would not face penalties for sourcing products made by slave labour, just for claiming they did not.\n\n\n\n\n\nJen Kanis says while this legal action is only preliminary, it could have wider impacts on the retail industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I guess the outcome of this case is about the documents, but what this case may lead to is a misleading and deceptive conduct claim. And I think that that has implications all retailers who make claims about ethical sourcing and being an ethical business. And it will mean that they won't be able to make those claims unless they can actually substantiate them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRamila Chanisheff says cheap clothing and strong economic ties with China should not come at the cost of human rights.\n\n\n\n",

And that he feels the United States is treated unfairly by its trading partners,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhat impact is Trump having on the US economy?\n\nLuke Hartigan, a lecturer in economics at the University of Sydney, told SBS News the US economy is dealing with a lot of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there's always a risk of a recession, and Trump's approach to people could also harm the economy,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Trump fired the commissioner of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) after the department revised down recent job numbers by more than 250,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite a lack of evidence, Trump said the figures were \"rigged\" to make his administration \"look bad\".\n\n\n\nHartigan said this was \"deeply concerning\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What this says is that Trump is not happy with the figures being provided, and that he would rather accuse the BLS of cooking the books rather than acknowledging the data that didn't suit him,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's deeply concerning about that is that if he puts in someone who's just looking to please Trump, they may want to mess with the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then we're in a world of very bad outcomes because you don't know what's happening in the economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the threat of recession and surprise dismissals might make investors uneasy, the impacts on Australia appear limited.\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean for Australia?\n\nAustralia managed to avoid an increase in the tariffs imposed by the US, with the rate remaining at the lowest level of 10 per cent .\n\n\n\n\n\nFlavio Menezes, a professor of economics at The University of Queensland, said any impact from these tariffs would be \"indirect\" for Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The broader and more significant impact is likely to be indirect \u2014 stemming from how these tariffs affect China, Australia's main trading partner, and subsequently other key partners such as the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The full extent of these ripple effects remains largely unresolved.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Rate cut outlook firms as RBA gets the 'outstanding' inflation data it was waiting for\n\nWhile the cost of groceries and household goods will largely remain the same, you could experience changes to your superannuation which is tied to foreign stock markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for now, Australia's economic picture is \"mixed\", Menezes said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unemployment has edged up slightly but remains at historically low levels.

Like if you had a poor physical health status, a poor mental health status, if you're unemployed, if you have financial strain, all those things are making people not just lonely, but staying lonely.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCathy Kezelman is President of the Blue Knot Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an organisation that helps adult survivors of childhood trauma.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it's important to recognise that some groups are especially vulnerable to persistent loneliness- including those who have experienced complex trauma, which can be connected to the experience of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says these experiences can intensify a person's withdrawal and isolation from community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think what happens when loneliness is profound is that it can obviously really impact our mental health. Obviously we can go into a spiral just with our own thoughts and ruminate and that can be very, very unhealthy. And obviously the more you withdraw, the less other input you're getting. And of course, mental health can impact physical health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theme of this year's Loneliness Awareness Week is 'Moments Matter', highlighting the importance of building connections at home, work, school, online and in the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Lim says this theme underscores Ending Loneliness Together's calls for more accessible inclusive community spaces, and free or low-cost opportunities to help young people nurture relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're living in an environment that's actually keeping us lonely. So what we really need to do is not just always put the onus on the individual themselves, but really those broader community, economic, and social forces that are really at play. What we're doing is advocating for systemic change. So that we are living in an environment where it helps us develop healthy social relationships easily, and maintaining those relationships.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe call for more investment in spaces that foster connection and belonging is one echoed in a Loneliness Inquiry report tabled in the New South Wales parliament earlier this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a year-long investigation into the prevalence, causes and impacts of loneliness in New South Wales, the Standing Committee on Social Issues has made 20 recommendations to tackle the growing loneliness epidemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nLauren Stracey, Chief Executive of Youth Action New South Wales, says the report's recommendation for more dedicated youth hubs stands out as critical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're hearing from young people is that they actually need to have their own safe spaces to be able to feel like they're connected and belonging in our community more broadly. And one of the recommendations was to invest in youth hubs. It can be your traditional sort of space, but it can also be made up from spaces that are just in your local environment. So it could be an unused community centre, a room somewhere. But the key thing is that it's about creating places for young people where they can spend time with their peers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says investing in safe and inclusive youth spaces, designed with the input and guidance of young people, is especially important given the national ban on social media for users under the age of 16 set to come into effect in December.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea of having youth hubs and new spaces, it's really about making sure that if we're taking away one way of being connected, that we are replacing it with an alternative. We can't just take away and remove the digital spaces without building real world ones. And so I think that one of the things that we are seeing is that youth hubs are really an antidote to this and that they can be the bridge from loneliness to belonging for our young people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says tackling the youth loneliness crisis needs to start with building opportunities for young people to find belonging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The thing with belonging is this is such a fundamental human need and young people need that just as much as anyone else. And so having a place where young people are able to go and be with their peers and also have role models around them, youth workers are incredible role models. Those are the kinds of things that really kind of ground us and help us develop into thriving adults.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd loneliness isn't just an issue limited to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Britain and Japan have, in recent years, even dedicated a federal ministry to dealing with the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know needs support, call Beyond Blue on 1300 224 636 or call Lifeline on 13 11 14.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Trump has said he is considering four contenders for the position of the Fed\u2019s chair, which will open up in May next year when the term of the current chair, Jerome Powell, who Trump detests and attacks relentlessly and viciously, will end. Hassett, current governor Christopher Waller and former governor Kevin Warsh are thought to be on his short list. He is weighing up whether to announce a short-term appointment \u2013 someone who would fill the position until the term expires on January 31 next year \u2013 or appointing a \u201cchair elect\u201d who will succeed Powell when his term as chair ends next May. It\u2019s a pivotal decision because the Kugler position might be the only opportunity he has to inject a loyalist into the Fed boardroom during this term. Powell\u2019s chairmanship might end in May but, should he choose to remain on the board, his term as a governor runs until 2028. There are no other scheduled retirements during the Trump presidency. Federal Reserve Board governor Adriana Kugler\u2019s unexpected resignation opens the door for Trump to tighten his grip on the Fed. Credit: AP There are reports that Trump\u2019s advisers (which include unusual names, like Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity and MAGA heavyweight Steve Bannon) are urging him to appoint someone who will occupy the seat only until January, giving him more time to decide on Powell\u2019s replacement.\n\nTrump could appoint someone designated as Powell\u2019s successor, hoping that a \u201cshadow\u201d chair would undermine Powell and Powell\u2019s messaging both within and outside the Fed\u2019s boardroom. The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (who has withdrawn himself from contention for the role), mooted exactly that strategy ahead of last year\u2019s US election. Whether the appointment is short term or unveils Powell\u2019s successor, however, the new governor would be one of only two Trump-appointed members on the seven-member board and the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee that actually decides US monetary policies. The other is the Fed\u2019s deputy chair, Michelle Bowman. Loading While Trump has made it very clear what he wants from the next Fed chair, it is less obvious what qualifications, other than loyalty, Trump wants from the incoming BLS commissioner. The blueprint for this administration \u2013 \u201cProject 2025\u201d \u2013 recommended appointing political appointees to the Labor department, within which the BLS sits, and consolidating the BLS with other data collecting agencies into a \u201cmore manageable\u201d mega statistical agency.\n\nThe BLS could do with a (non-political) overhaul. It has a challenge with its current data surveys because, post-COVID, the response rates from businesses have dropped significantly. That\u2019s part of the explanation for why its revisions of June quarter data, which showed a major fall in jobs generation, were so large. The decisions could have a significant impact on America\u2019s interest rates and economy. Credit: Bloomberg Even as it has become harder for the bureau to collect accurate data, it has experienced a reduction in its resources in recent years that is being compounded by job losses and an 8 per cent cut to next year\u2019s budget because of Trump\u2019s assault on the US bureaucracy. If its data is to be made more reliable and credible, it needs more, not fewer, resources and someone \u2013 like Kugler \u2013 who is non-partisan and clearly qualified as its head. If Trump appoints a loyalist, it would cast a shadow over the accuracy of data central to the markets and businesses\u2019 understanding of economic conditions and probably lead to an increase in risk premia in US interest rates.\n\nThe ironic aspect of Trump\u2019s response to the weak employment data is that it actually strengthens the case for a rate cut. The Fed has a dual mandate, charged with maximising employment and price stability. It has kept rates on hold while it waits to see the effects of Trump\u2019s trade policies on an inflation rate that, at 2.7 per cent, is already above its target of 2 per cent. The two appointments to critical economic agencies have the potential to undermine the credibility of the Fed\u2019s policy decisions and the BLS\u2019s data if financial market participants and businesses suspect that the Fed\u2019s decisions and the BLS\u2019s data have been tainted by political influences. The inflation rate has been edging up even before the full effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs have had time to reveal themselves, but the economy has slowed markedly and the BLS data shows the unemployment rate is edging up even as the job market shrinks and salaries stagnate. Where, before that data, the odds were against a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting next month, they \u2013 and an increasing number of Fed governors \u2013 now favour a rate cut.\n\nInstead of accusing (without any evidence) the BLS of manipulating its date to make his economic management look bad, Trump should have seized on it to proclaim that he was right, and the Fed wrong, on the need for a rate cut. Trump can probably cause conflicts and dysfunction within the Fed and the BLS if that is his objective with the appointments he makes. Whether that achieves his broader ambitions, however, is another matter. Even if he could stack the Fed board with loyalists, which he can\u2019t, or intimidate the majority of the Open Market Committee, which is unlikely, the Fed can only influence US short term rates. The federal funds rate anchors the bond market\u2019s yield curve, but longer term rates are set by the market itself.\n\nIf investors thought the Fed\u2019s decision-making had been politicised, they would demand higher yields to compensate for the increased risk of inflation and increase the premium required for holding longer-term bonds. Loading The yield curve would steepen, and it is those yields at the longer end of the curve that determine the rates on mortgage and car loans and business\u2019 interest costs. It is the Fed\u2019s credibility as an independent, apolitical agency that will contain inflation that gives it a broader influence over the curve than just the federal funds rate. Similarly, if the BLS data is regarded as tainted and unreliable, it will inject uncertainty and caution into businesses\u2019 decision-making and probably lead to less employment and investment.",

    "text": "\u201cWhat we have now means the best employers don\u2019t get punished for being the best employers,\u201d he said. But of the dozen companies that have signed up to the deal inked by the association with the support of the AMWU and Labor, at least half are facing questions about their business practices, including one company, Fredon Air, run by a former bankrupt, and another, Emax Air, that is a defendant in criminal proceedings. Ohlback, a HVAC association director, owes creditors $613,138 according to the February liquidators\u2019 report for his former company, Precision Air Services. His business partner, Smith, who continued as a director after Ohlback resigned in January 2023, owes $1.2 million. Liquidator Michael Jones found the company may have been trading while insolvent since June 30, 2022, due to \u201csignificant losses from government projects\u201d and the \u201cprolonged impact of COVID-19\u2033. But in April that year, Precision Air Services was plastered all over Gavin Ohlback Racing\u2019s car in the Australian Midget Championship, also known as speedcar, as it chased the national speedway championship.\n\n\u201cWhilst the team spends plenty of time in the shed making sure the cars fast, they also ensure the car is presented in the best possible fashion,\u201d Ohlback wrote on Facebook in February 2022. HVAC association director Gavin Ohlback\u2019s midget (speedcar) car racing team. Credit: Facebook The Ohlbacks sold their six-bedroom home in Kenthurst, in Sydney\u2019s north-west, in 2016 for $4 million. Then they bought the house next door for $2.05 million and a 5-bedroom home in Cattai for $2.9 million. In 2021, they submitted plans for a $96,000 extension of the Cattai home, including a new garage and a pool and spa, complete with rugby league goal posts out front. By March 2024, Precision Air Services had assets of $75 in its bank, according to Jones, after it paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans to Ohlback and Smith. The pair then set up another company, S&A Solutions, which signed onto the AMWU deal. Ohlback did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cI may be forced to commence legal actions for the recovery of those amounts,\u201d Jones said in his report to creditors in February.\n\nFellow HVAC association founder Sergio Gonzalez built a full-size enclosed futsal pitch with artificial turf in his front yard in Denham Court, while his Sublime air-conditioning companies have gone through three liquidations and accrued debts to the tax office and creditors of more than $2 million. But liquidators said recouping those debts would be a challenge because Gonzalez has no real property holdings to his name. Property records show the six-bedroom mansion in Denham Court, which has undergone extensive renovations in recent years, is registered in his wife\u2019s name, Romina Gonzalez. Sergio Gonzalez\u2019s home in Denham Court, complete with futsal pitch. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong Liquidators said they were investigating whether there had been a \u201cpotential phoenix transaction\u201d and whether Gonzalez had breached corporate law by incurring debts while trading insolvent, failing to keep financial records and not providing the company\u2019s books to liquidators. Gonzalez fell out with other HVAC association founders in October after accusing them of doing a deal with the AMWU \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d. He resigned as a director of the association and transferred his workers to an agreement with the Plumbers Union.\n\nThe split sparked a series of claims and counterclaims after the HVAC association accused the Plumbers Union of intimidating builders into joining their enterprise bargaining agreement. The Plumbers Union accused the HVAC association of attempting to rope in other firms into the multi-employer deal that would have no power over the negotiations. Gonzalez told The Australian Financial Review in October that he had not seen the HVAC deal before he was asked to sign on. \u201cThey said we\u2019re going to do it, and you\u2019re going to be part of it.\u201d Sergio Gonzalez and Fair Trading Minister Anoulack Chanthivong (second and third from right) at Westmead Health Precinct in May.

Fair Trading Minister Anoulack Chanthivong attended a ducting installation with Gonzalez at Westmead Health Precinct in May. Gonzalez, who did not respond to requests for comment, previously ran labour hire company Sublime Onsite, which also went into liquidation in 2018. Beecroft, another HVAC association director, has failed multiple payment plans with the ATO and faces a claim of trading while insolvent for at least five years. His former company, Traminer Industries, owed $158,155 to the ATO when it was liquidated in 2019. His most recent company, Traminer Industries (NSW), owed $593,000 to the tax office, according to a restructuring proposal submitted to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission in July.\n\nDarren Beecroft called for US-style immigration raids on social media. Credit: Facebook Beecroft said the debts had all been sorted through a new small business payment plan. \u201cI\u2019m all good,\u201d he said. \u201cI pay every one of my guys exactly what the agreement says.\u201d In June, Beecroft suggested immigration officials should raid Australian construction sites after US President Donald Trump ordered immigration officials to target Mexican and South American workers on construction sites. \u201cMaybe we need to do this in Australian work sites,\u201d he said on Facebook alongside a video of migrant workers being arrested.\n\nBeecroft has also accused gender diverse people of having a mental illness, suggested climate change was a scam, labelled activist Greta Thunberg a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d and re-posted a meme accusing \u201cwoke parents\u201d of cutting their kids\u2019 \u201cnuts off\u201d. Beecroft said he stood by his personal views \u201c100 per cent\u201d. The HVAC association\u2019s spokesman and leader, Mimmo Scavera, said in October that the association was planning to \u201crope in\u201d a further six companies in the sector into the AMWU deal despite resistance from the Plumbers Union and the Australian Industry Group. Scavera praised the deal for allowing the companies to pool resources among their 600 employees to work on multiple sites under the same conditions. HVAC Manufacturing and Installation Association spokesman Mimmo Scavera. Credit: Louie Douvis But Scavera has also faced difficulties after being accused by a former employee in the Fair Work Commission in 2016 of wage underpayment, bullying and unfair termination of his employment. Scavera denied the allegations. The commission recommended that the employee take his case to the Fair Work Ombudsman.\n\nThe deal has also been under scrutiny from critics, including the Business Council of Australia, which claimed in a submission to parliament in November that workers under the HVAC multi-employer agreement would be $1.27 worse off per hour compared to the Plumbers Union deal with single employers by 2027. The AMWU said last year the deal would increase the annual pay of air-conditioning installation workers from $102,000 to $133,000 over the life of the agreement. Innes Willox, the Australian Industry Group\u2019s chief executive, said a group of companies could use multi-employer bargaining to push smaller competitors out of the market who could not compete for employees. \u201cThe great fear has always been that multi-party bargaining can be used for essentially anticompetitive purposes, to drive out competition within a marketplace, which then drives up rates in the end for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe flip side of the coin is that it has the potential to drive businesses to the wall. It takes away the ability of businesses to manage their individual business in the way and form that they see is the best fit for their business.\u201d",

    "text": "It will be \u201cthe biggest infrastructure project in the West\u201d, he said, after a government committee with oversight of strategic public investments approved the project. Loading It will also help Italy reach the increased 5 per cent defence spending targets that the Trump administration has long demanded of its NATO allies. Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government has indicated that it will classify the Messina bridge as a strategic investment, which will help bump up its current defence spending, which stands at less than 2 per cent of its GDP. The government has argued that the bridge would strengthen Europe\u2019s defences by facilitating easier troop movements to military bases in Sicily, part of NATO\u2019s southern flank. Preliminary work and geological surveys are due to begin in the autumn, with construction expected to start next year. The bridge is due to be completed by 2032 or 2033.\n\nThe project would create 120,000 jobs a year and billions of euros would be invested in new roads, railway stations and other related infrastructure, Salvini said. Addressing worries that the \u2019Ndrangheta and Cosa Nostra would be rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of skimming off billions of euros in government funding, he said there would be vigilance \u201c24 hours a day\u201d against mafia infiltration. The bridge is due to be completed by 2032 or 2033. Credit: AP The government would employ the same anti-mafia precautions that had been used for other lucrative infrastructure projects, such as the World\u2019s Fair in Milan in 2015 and next year\u2019s Winter Olympics, which will be held in Milan and the Alpine resort of Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo. \u201cWe have to watch the whole supply chain so that it is impervious to bad-intentioned people,\u201d said Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister and head of the League, one of three parties in Meloni\u2019s coalition government.\n\nTrains and vehicles currently have to cross the strait on ferries, with railway carriages laboriously transferred to the boats. Once the bridge is built, up to 6000 cars an hour will be able to cross, as well as 200 trains a day. The journey time by car will be cut from an hour to just 10 minutes. Aside from mafia infiltration and seismic instability, critics point out that Sicily and Calabria are among Italy\u2019s poorest regions, with pot-holed roads, understaffed hospitals, crumbling schools and woeful public transport. They say it would be far better to use the billions of euros to improve basic services. The project \u201crepresents the greatest waste of public money ever seen in Italy\u201d, said Angelo Bonelli, an MP from the Greens and Left Alliance.\n\nIt was an arrogant vanity project by Salvini that would throw \u201cbillions of euros into concrete and propaganda\u201d, he said.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size He folds it in quietly, mid-thought, somewhere between a lament about lost notes, a gentle defence of his landline, and reflections on readings. \u201cSee \u2026 because I haven\u2019t \u2026 I\u2019ve stopped writing novels,\u201d he says, with a hint of hesitation \u2013 not quite reluctant, more aware the revelation won\u2019t go unremarked. No fuss, no fireworks. Just the quiet confirmation that there won\u2019t be another novel from Peter Carey \u2013 the only Australian to win the Booker Prize twice, and one of only a handful to win the Miles Franklin three times. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d stopped. I had a fear that I might have written all the novels I needed or should write,\u201d Carey, 82, says. \u201cBut I persisted, and tried various things, and threw things away \u2026 and in the end I thought, well, that\u2019s it.\u201d Peter Carey in New York, where he has lived now for 35 years. Credit: Idris Solomon The boy from Bacchus Marsh became a literary giant, showing Australians a funhouse mirror version of their own history \u2013 grotesque, funny, violent, and absurd \u2013 and carrying that vision to the world. There have been 14 novels \u2013 including Illywhacker, Oscar and Lucinda, True History of the Kelly Gang, Theft: A Love Story and The Chemistry of Tears \u2013 two volumes of short stories, and two travelogues. Books full of mythmakers and tricksters, schemers and fabulists, each one animated by Carey\u2019s unmistakable voice \u2013 sly, digressive, electric with curiosity. He emerged alongside a transformative generation of Australian writers, but carved a path all his own, refusing to conform, mixing high style with larrikinism, postmodern and postcolonial play with emotional heft. And for decades, the rhythm never faltered. Every few years, like clockwork, a new Carey novel. Then it stopped \u2013 and the silence started to feel pointed. Asking a writer how their next novel is going is like asking a magician how the trick works: awkward, disappointing, and you\u2019re probably not going to get an invitation back. Now, the question has answered itself. Carey\u2019s last novel, A Long Way from Home, was published nearly eight years ago, and he sees it as standing tall among his most meaningful books. It marked a turning point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Carey in 2001 when he won the Booker Prize for the second time for True History of the Kelly Gang. Credit: AP \u201cThere\u2019s a time when you\u2019re new to everybody \u2013 you do something like Oscar and Lucinda or Illywhacker, and you get hugely noticed. The Kelly Gang, also,\u201d Carey says. \u201cBut A Long Way from Home, which, I think, is as important a thing as I\u2019ve done\u2026 it doesn\u2019t sit like that. No one particularly thinks of it as the best thing he\u2019s ever done or the most important thing. But I thought it was.\u201d The novel follows a 1950s car race across Australia, but beneath the bonnet is something more volatile: an attempt to grapple with the country\u2019s foundational violence, its settler legacy. Carey has long circled Australia\u2019s history and national mythology, but in A Long Way from Home, he took it on directly. He wanted to write, as a white Australian, about imperialism and invasion. It felt risky, and he was nervous about how it would land, particularly when he returned to Australia to tour the book. But he felt he pulled it off \u2013 or, as he puts it, \u201cI didn\u2019t make a dick of myself.\u201d Carey isn\u2019t expecting an orchestra of tiny violins to start playing. There appears to be a straightforward, if perhaps melancholic, acceptance: the more you publish, the less of a fuss it makes. His good friend Tom Keneally once told him that when they were new, everyone thought they were brilliant \u2013 now, they\u2019re just part of the furniture.

We all know that from our reading, and from how it feels to discover a writer,\u201d Carey says. \u201cWe tend to be less excited about the third or fourth book, but we were absolutely stunned by the first. That\u2019s the way it goes \u2026 You have to know when it\u2019s enough, too.\u201d As we talk, a bookshelf packed with Carey\u2019s novels watches over us. This year marks 35 years since he left Australia for New York \u2013 much longer than he ever planned to stay away. He moved there with his second wife, Alison Summers, a theatre-maker and editor, and they had two sons. The marriage ended, but he stayed. Carey says Australians tend to get anxious or angry about those who leave, but he says his thinking and writing have always looked back to home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, his old novels were scattered around the Manhattan apartment he shares with his wife, Frances Coady, a book editor and publisher turned agent. After returning from the A Long Way from Home tour, he finally corralled them onto shelves. In front of them, Carey made several attempts at a new novel \u2013 two, maybe three, different starts, each hundreds of pages long \u2013 but nothing stuck. There was no urgency behind them, no force demanding the work into being. After A Long Way from Home, the compulsion just wasn\u2019t there. Peter Carey photographed in the 1970s. Credit: Ray Lawrence \u201cAfter a while, you develop a lot of skills \u2013 you can make things work. But the last thing you want to do is bullshit yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to ask, do you need to write this? Why are you rewriting and rewriting and rewriting? Because you\u2019re trying to find something that isn\u2019t there. And that\u2019s OK. I mean, I\u2019m 82 years old, for f---\u2019s sake.\u201d There was no ceremonial uncapping of the pen, no dramatic farewell to fiction. Certainly no relief, he says he didn\u2019t feel happy about it. It\u2019s been about five years now, he guesses, since he called it a day. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people \u2013 this is what I do. And when you can\u2019t do that any more\u2026 who are you?\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t even play golf. I\u2019m certainly not going sailing. In the end, you\u2019re someone who could do one trick \u2013 and that\u2019s write.\u201d Peter Carey photographed at his New York home in 2009. Credit: Keke Keukelaar And that one trick hasn\u2019t disappeared. Carey\u2019s now working on a non-fiction project \u2013 \u201cenough to keep me off the street,\u201d as he puts it \u2013 and while it\u2019s a different muscle from fiction, it still scratches an itch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m engaged in making something and it\u2019s a little risky, and it\u2019s beyond what I think I know how to do, and that\u2019s exciting, right?\u201d The past few years have brought other big changes, too. For nearly two decades, Carey was a distinguished professor and the executive director of the creative writing MFA at public university Hunter College, a program he helped build into one of the country\u2019s best, and most competitive courses. Former alumni include Susan Choi, Jennifer Egan, Paul Beatty and Adam Haslett. He left a few years ago. He laughs about the creeping signs of age: forgetting book titles when talking to students, stretching sentences to give himself time to remember. He won\u2019t be drawn on the details, but it doesn\u2019t sound as though it was the fondest farewell. \u201cThere were ... let\u2019s call them administrative issues, shall we? That went on for a couple of years. I resolved them. But I didn\u2019t want to deal with any of that ever again,\u201d he says. Those professional shifts come amid a milestone year for Carey: the 25th anniversary of True History of the Kelly Gang, the swaggering Booker-winning novel written in the unpunctuated voice of Australia\u2019s most infamous outlaw. Peter Carey pictured in 1994. Carey is one of five Australian artists commissioned by the State Library of Victoria to contribute to Creative Acts, a new exhibition showcasing 600 artefacts from the library\u2019s collection, all exploring the theme of creativity. His piece \u2013 a reflection on the 1000 days he spent writing True History of the Kelly Gang \u2013 draws on the personal archive he\u2019s contributed over the years, including 4000 pages of drafts, marked-up manuscripts, and the chunky 1990s Apple computer he used to write the novel. He\u2019s been selling archival material for some time \u2013 \u201cevery time I need to pay the school fees,\u201d he jokes. Some of it won\u2019t be unsealed until after his death. Asked if there\u2019s anything particularly juicy in there, he shoots back: \u201cOh, I mean, if I was going to pay back somebody, I\u2019d rather do it while I was alive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe origin story of True History of the Kelly Gang is almost mythic in itself. Carey, whose parents ran a car dealership in Ballarat and scraped together the funds to send him to Geelong Grammar, flunked his first-year science exams at Monash University. He\u2019d once imagined himself a chemist or a zoologist \u2013 until a car crash and some existential drift nudged him into advertising. There, among copywriters who harboured secret literary ambitions, he was introduced to James Joyce, Graham Greene, Jack Kerouac and William Faulkner. One day, his colleague Barry Oakley \u2013 a former schoolteacher and writer \u2013 took him to George\u2019s Art Gallery to see Sidney Nolan\u2019s Ned Kelly paintings. Carey was entranced. He sought out Ned Kelly: Australian Son by Max Brown, and became fixated on the Jerilderie letter, Kelly\u2019s \u201cmanifesto\u201d, dictated as a defence against what he saw as the relentless persecution from the colonial establishment. Carey transcribed the letter by hand and carried it around \u201clike the relic of a martyred saint\u201d, certain he would one day do something with it. Years passed. There were false starts and failed novels, then critical successes. The letter was lost somewhere along the way. But in 1994, at the age of 51, Carey wandered into the Met in New York and stumbled across Nolan\u2019s full suite of 27 Kelly paintings. The vision returned \u2013 and this time, he started writing. Peter Carey has now turned his attention to writing a work of non-fiction. Credit: Ben Sklar \u201cIt feels like yesterday really. Well, not quite, but 25 years is sort of shocking. I mean, shit,\u201d he says. The novel was a critical and commercial success, winning the Booker Prize and the Commonwealth Writers\u2019 Prize and inspiring film adaptations. Yet Carey thinks the final product was very different from what the young man who first dreamt it expected. That writer wanted to go off the deep end of the avant-garde. \u201cThat writer would have thought I was a total sellout. That writer was ridiculous, but charming in his way. But the Kelly Gang was not what he had in mind, and that came slowly over time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",
