(iStock)\n\nWe have fewer friends\n\nThe survey found that our social connections are weakening, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAustralians are reporting fewer friends and less frequent socialising than at the turn of the century.\n\n\"Not only do we feel like we have fewer friends, but we're also socialising less frequently than in 2001,\" senior research fellow and report co-author Dr Inga Lass said.\n\nThe proportion of people meeting friends or relatives several times a week or more has dropped by over 12 percentage points, from about 32 per cent to just 20 per cent.\n\nThis decline in social connection has potential implications for our overall well-being.\n\nThe survey also found that a majority of Australians now report experiencing bodily pain, a trend that has worsened since 2001, even when accounting for the nation's ageing population.\n\nPeople in lower-income households were also more likely to report experiencing pain, co-author Dr Ferdi Botha said.\n\n\"The less money you make, the more pain you're likely putting up with,\" Botha said.\n\nThe hidden tax of inflation\n\nThe survey revealed that Australians are paying the highest average income tax rate since the study began in 2001.\n\nThis is not due to a change in policy but rather to \"bracket creep\".\n\nAs wages have risen to keep pace with inflation, many workers have been pushed into higher tax brackets, effectively reducing their real purchasing power.\n\nProfessor Roger Wilkins explained that while wage growth is normally a good thing, a combination of bracket creep and rapidly rising prices has contributed to a decline in workers' living standards in recent years.\n\nSydney's Hyde Park at dusk. Life in Australia is becoming more expensive and we are paying more tax. (iStock)\n\nThis phenomenon affects middle-income earners more significantly than high-income earners.\n\nWilkins also highlighted a reversal in household spending patterns.\n\nPrior to 2021, Australians were spending less on necessities.\n\nHowever, the recent cost-of-living crisis undid that progress, with the total proportion of income spent on necessities jumping by 4.5 per cent between 2021 and 2023.\n\nEconomic pressures reshape family and work\n\nThe report also sheds light on how economic pressures are influencing our biggest life decisions.\n\nFor the first time, the average number of children men want has fallen below two.\n\nWhile having two children remained the most common wish, there's a notable increase in the number of people, both men and women, who now want only one child, or none at all.\n\nLass attributed this to potential parents growing \"more concerned about their financial security and the costs of raising a child.\"\n\nFinally, the notion of retiring in your early 60s is fast becoming a thing of the past.\n\nThe proportion of women aged 60-64 who are retired has plunged from 70 per cent in 2003 to just 41 per cent in 2023.\n\nFor men in the same age bracket, the retirement rate has fallen from 49 per cent to a low of 27 per cent.\n\nWhile some are choosing to work longer, the survey points to a more unsettling trend for many.\n\nThe number of retirees living in private rentals has doubled in two decades, facing significant financial strain as average annual rent payments have surged by 37 per cent in real terms.",

    "text": "Australia has not set a renewable energy target to match its 2035 climate goal, with minister Chris Bowen distancing himself from the suggestion a near-complete renewables rollout would be needed.\n\nLast week the federal government announced it would target an emissions reduction of 62 to 70 per cent on 2005 levels by 2035, as recommended by the independent Climate Change Authority.\n\nThe CCA and Treasury projected Australia would need to exceed 90 per cent renewable coverage to achieve that reduction, while also quadrupling wind power and doubling rooftop solar rates.\n\nBut Mr Bowen said that was \"commentary on the sorts of things that might happen\" and did not constitute a formal target.\n\nAustralia vows to cut emissions 62 to 70 per cent by 2035 Photo shows Anthony Albanese, with Matt Kean and Chris Bowen behind him. Australia will vow to cut its emissions by 62 to 70 per cent by 2035, lifting its sights further as the world strives to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\"We haven't set a particular target,\" the energy minister told the ABC's Insiders.\n\n\"What we have done is set our emissions reduction target.\"\n\nAustralia does have a renewables target of 82 per cent by 2030, which would require a major quickening of pace to achieve.\n\nMr Bowen said he was \"confident\" the earlier target could be met but acknowledged it was an \"ongoing challenge\".\n\n\"Once we get to 82 per cent renewable energy in 2030, which I am working towards achieving, and have some confidence we will achieve, then we'll keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously, 82 is a high number \u2026 When you get to a number like 82, and then to continue to go after that, you've got to keep working. The low-hanging fruit disappears.\"\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt on Sunday said the Albanese government had approved its 100th renewables project, as it continues to seek to land a deal on approval laws it acknowledges are slow and outdated.\n\n\"Our country needs to continue supporting the rapid rollout of renewables to meet our ambitious and achievable 2035 target,\" Senator Watt said.\n\nMr Bowen also declined to sign up to the CCA's suggestions that a quadrupling of wind power and a doubling of rooftop solar would be needed, saying these figures were \"a possibility\", not a policy.\n\n\"What [the CCA] did in their report to me, quite rightly, is ran through some of the possibilities as to what achieving [the emissions target] might look like.\n\n\"Now of course, there is an opportunity to over-achieve on some things, underachieve on others \u2026 That will play out.\"\n\nTarget 'ambitious' but 'doable', Bowen says\n\nMr Bowen is in New York this week with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for a UN summit, where Australia will present its new target.\n\nAmid criticism from environmental groups that Australia's target is insufficient, the energy minister said it was aligned with the global aspiration of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees.\n\nThe mammoth task ahead to reach the 2035 target Photo shows Anthony Albanese close up, with Chris Bowen in background. Getting to even the bottom end of the government's 62 to 70 per cent emissions reduction target by 2035 will require drastic increases to solar and wind power capacity, electric vehicle take-up and an extension of the safeguard mechanism, according to the Climate Change Authority.\n\n\"Maximum possible effort is what's required. You can look at the IPCC, over the last few reports, which said 68 per cent from the world is what's required. That's well within our target range,\" he said.\n\n\"This target is very much focused on results. And the results involved in this, even at 72, would be a halving of our ambitions today \u2026 This is very ambitious [and] it's doable, it's achievable.\"\n\nMr Bowen said the government would not set a target for electric vehicle sales, with the CCA also projecting a 20-fold increase would be needed inside a decade.\n\nAustralia will continue to negotiate with T\u00fcrkiye this week as the two countries jostle over hosting rights for next year's climate summit.\n\nMr Bowen said Australia had \"overwhelming support for its bid\" but the process remained stuck because the UN rules required \"consensus\".\n\n\"We have discussions with our Turkish friends this week \u2026 This situation hasn't really changed for a while.\"",

(Supplied: Joseph Goy)\n\n\"Last year was a real eye-opener of the devastation the [cockchafer] can do. We ended up having 30 to 40 hectares of entire wipe-out in an area,\" he said.\n\n\"To start with, the crop germinated as normal.\n\n\"During some crop inspections, we saw a few plants that were yellow, but as the season progressed, those areas grew bigger.\n\n\" That was nearly 100 tonne of grain missing out of that paddock. \"\n\nThe pest is known to feed on roots beneath the soil, causing damage that often goes unnoticed until it's too late. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nLocalised threat\n\nThe pest was first detected in the region a decade ago on the property of Lake Grace farmer Tom Dunham.\n\nA different species of cockchafer was also identified in the 1990s in Harrismith, about 65 kilometres north-east of the town.\n\nDespite his best efforts to control the outbreak, Mr Dunham said the pest had devastated a wide range of his crops.\n\n\"We've tried various things over the years such as chemicals, reefinating and looking at our seeding rate,\" Mr Dunham said.\n\n\"But it was getting to a point for us where we were having to suck it up and deal with it, because nothing works.\"\n\nThe pest was detected on Tom Dunham's farm 10 years ago. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nThe spread of the cockchafer and the growing number of affected farmers have sparked a growing push for a management solution.\n\n\"It's costing us every year to varying degrees and we're losing a fair bit at the moment,\" Mr Dunham said.\n\n\"So it's good that more people are looking at it and realising it is a problem, rather than just [in] an isolated area.\"\n\nTom Dunham's crops have taken a significant hit once again. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nResearch underway\n\nThe cockchafer has only impacted certain areas, but research has begun to help farmers like Mr Gray and Mr Dunham manage the growing populations on their properties.\n\nField trials funded by the Council of Grain Grower Organisations (COGGO) are underway on three affected farms to identify practical, on-ground solutions.\n\nBen Whisson says the goal is to find solutions that can be immediately put into practice. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\n\"We're trying to find grower-ready strategies that can be used instantly,\" agronomist Ben Whisson said.\n\n\" We're looking at insecticide options, different placements of products [and] combinations of things to see what is going to be the best scenario. \"\n\nThe Department of Primary Industries (DPIRD) and the Grains Research and Development Corporation have also teamed up in the fight against the pest.\n\nDusty Severtson says work is underway to identify the species at a molecular level. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nDPIRD research scientist Dusty Severtson said the species' DNA was being investigated and urged farmers to report detections.\n\n\"Department researchers are working with Murdoch University to DNA-sequence samples to identify the species, or perhaps multiple species, at a molecular level,\" he said.\n\n\"This will give us a better understanding of the number of species we are dealing with and to characterise or barcode new or unknown species being found in crops.\"",

    "text": "The AFLW's rapid evolution has been a double-edged sword for Adelaide, which is the most successful club in competition history, having won three of the eight premierships.\n\nWhile just five inaugural Crows remain since their premiership-winning 2017 side, they have been in half of all the competition's grand finals and made it to at least a preliminary final every year since 2021.\n\nRoos claim 18th straight win Photo shows Four Kangaroos AFLw players celebrate a goal. Reigning premiers North Melbourne thrashes Carlton by 53 points, while Port Adelaide is stunned by an umpiring decision in its narrow loss to Geelong.\n\nYet in round one, they were shocked with a 22-point defeat to St Kilda after scoring just two goals.\n\nOriginal Crow and now star player Anne Hatchard said it was a defeat that was hard to take.\n\n\"[It] kind of just really hit because, I guess we didn't go in too confident, but I don't think we really expected what happened out in the field. We weren't, I guess, prepared for it. So that kind of hit hard,\" Hatchard told ABC Sport.\n\nAdelaide currently sits sixth after a 3-2 start and will face Gold Coast on Sunday afternoon.\n\nAdelaide were shocked with a 22-point defeat to St Kilda in round one after scoring just two goals (Getty: Daniel Pockett)\n\nAfter the Saints, the Crows immediately bounced back the following weekend with a 38-point win against Geelong, thanks to a fourth-quarter seven-goal blitz.\n\nThey then beat GWS by 32 points after a four-goal opening quarter - they only kicked three goals over the next three quarters.\n\nThen ending the winning run, they suffered their second loss of the season to the reigning grand finalists Brisbane by three points in round four.\n\nIt wasn't until they defeated Hawthorn by 21 points last weekend that Hatchard said they had a complete four-quarter performance.\n\n\"Whenever you get a loss, it's like, 'OK, what can we do now? What do we need to do?' Everyone gets a bit frantic,\" Hatchard said.\n\n\"So it's nice having that win against the Hawks, who are a very, very strong team.\n\n\"They started four and zip. To come out and get that win just gave our girls a lot of confidence and that belief that we can do it when we play our footy.\"\n\nAnne Hatchard said the Crows' victory against the Hawks was her side's most-complete four-quarter performance this year. (Getty: Morgan Hancock)\n\nThe AFLW season runs from August to November, with preseason practice matches the month prior, meaning teams don't get to see or play each other for seven months of the year.\n\nTop sides like the Crows can often come out of preseason and be struck by how much the competition has evolved.\n\nLast season it was Melbourne - currently third after a 4-1 start - who finished ninth and missed finals. They had only dropped two games for the entire 2023 season.\n\n\"These teams just keep coming and coming. Especially the Saints. I was super impressed with how they came out and played. They were such a unit \u2026 We just have to keep trying to get better and better,\" Hatchard said.\n\nCollingwood is righting the ship this AFLW season Photo shows Collingwood AFLW players celebrate a goal. A year after finishing dead last in the AFLW, the Magpies have started making moves up the ladder thanks to a new approach at both ends of the field.\n\nThe 27-year-old three-time premiership player and three-time club best and fairest is also aware that dynasties in sport are rare as it's hard to stay at top for long periods of time.\n\n\"I'm so grateful that we've been in a very successful team, and it's heartbreaking losing prelim finals, we just want to keep pushing to make those grand finals,\" Hatchard said.\n\n\"I know a lot of girls go through [the competition] and they don't even get to play finals. Let alone, I've got three premiership medals.\n\n\"It has been amazing to be part of this talented group and talented program.\"\n\nIt's a group that Hatchard assures is aiming for another grand final appearance this year.\n\n\"I love that the competition is getting better and better, because you go on out there and you know the game's going to be hard. No game is easy going into this season,\" Hatchard said.\n\n\"It's awesome for the competition and I love it, as much as I hate losing.\"",

(ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nIn the words of ACT Greens leader Shane Rattenbury, who authored the bill, \"it will start the process of reshaping the way we think about housing in this city\".\n\n\"It will create a new requirement, by law, for the government to treat housing not as a private asset for wealth creation, but as a foundational social good,\" he said.\n\nThough not everyone is convinced that lofty goal can be achieved.\n\nShould others states follow?\n\nChris Martin, a senior research fellow at the City Futures Research Centre at UNSW said the legislation was not \"a radical change in thinking\".\n\n\"But it's definitely a step in the right direction and something that other jurisdictions should be looking at to better organise the way we think about and do housing,\" he said.\n\nDr Martin said the legislation had some limitations \u2014 it doesn't impact decisions made by private landlords, for example.\n\n\"It doesn't mean ACT citizens suddenly have a whole lot of new rights,\" he said.\n\n\"But it does signal that the ACT government will consider the right to housing when they make laws and also when they make decisions about individual people interacting with them.\"\n\nChris Martin said the legislation doesn't impact decisions made by private landlords. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nImportantly, the legislation also opens the government up to possible legal challenges, providing a mechanism for Canberrans to hold decision-makers to account.\n\nHuman Rights Minister Tara Cheyne said the bill \"recognises that access to adequate housing must be progressively realised over time\".\n\nBut she also confirmed that certain protections must be guaranteed sooner \u2014 including protection against unlawful and arbitrary eviction.\n\n\"It won't solve all of our housing challenges overnight but [it's a] pretty powerful building block to our legal foundation,\" she said.\n\nA first step\n\nTiana affords rent by having her landlords live in her backyard Photo shows A woman with red hair in a navy shirt staring at the camera. There is a widening housing divide in a city that boasts the highest weekly median income in the country.\n\nThe Australian-first laws will take effect in January 2027.\n\nBut there's a delayed start, allowing additional time for the government to prepare during a two-year implementation period.\n\nThat means the broad scope of including the right to housing in the Human Rights Act won't commence until January 2029.\n\nWhile many agree enshrining housing as a human right is a good first step, to solve some of the housing issues in the territory, this feels like the first step in a marathon.\n\nAnd the government will need plenty of focus to make it to the finish line.",

    "text": "When Lisa Perry booked her dream wedding venue in the Hawkesbury region, she never expected it to go up in flames two weeks before her special day.\n\nShe had also not planned to take out a $23,000 loan in the days leading up to the nuptials.\n\nThe 43-year-old and her partner Mitch were among the couples left scrambling to find a replacement venue after a fire tore through the Loxley on Bellbird Hill at Kurrajong Hills on September 5.\n\nFirefighters battled the blaze at the historic wedding venue in the Hawkesbury. (Supplied: NSW Rural Fire Service)\n\nMore than 80 firefighters with 25 trucks worked to battle the flames, but the venue's historic main building was completely destroyed.\n\nWith the invoice paid in full and only a fortnight left to salvage their wedding plans, Lisa said she made dozens of calls to the Loxley that went unanswered.\n\n\"We would have thought that they'd have solicitors, or that they would have somebody on their part that would have contacted us,\" she said.\n\nAn interior shot of the building before the fire. (Supplied)\n\nThe only correspondence she claimed she received was a text from the wedding coordinator on the night of the fire telling her the best course of action would be to email the venue.\n\n\"We understand that the owners are obviously going through a horrible time themselves, what we don't understand is why we're getting married this week and we still haven't heard anything,\" she said.\n\nThe couple have spent more than a year planning and saving for their wedding. (Supplied)\n\nThe Loxley told the ABC in a statement that staff were \"continuing their communication with our valued customers who had bookings at our venue\".\n\n\"As we navigate this challenging time, we thank everyone for their compassion and understanding while we work through this process.\"\n\nThe venue encouraged enquiries to be made via email.\n\nThe cabins at Loxley on Bellbird Hill in the months before the blaze.\n\nA last-minute bank loan\n\nDespite being more than $20,000 out of pocket, Lisa said it was not as straightforward as cancelling the wedding altogether.\n\nFor Lisa, the Loxley held strong sentimental value, having chosen the venue with her late-father who passed away only three weeks ago.\n\n\"We have family that chose not to make dad's funeral, to come for a happier time,\" she said.\n\n\"It was an absolutely beautiful venue, so to lose him and to lose that wedding venue as well it's just all daggers.\"\n\nThe fire completely destroyed the Loxley's main building. (ABC News)\n\nThe couple were approved for a $23,000 loan and have managed to book another venue in time.\n\nBut Lisa felt sorry for the couples who were unable to afford a second deposit up-front and unsure of what to do next.\n\n\"It's their [Loxley's] job to at least give us an outlay of 'OK we're going through insurances, this is what's happening'. I think we deserve that at least,\" she said.\n\nCouples left feeling 'very anxious'\n\nAnother bride, Emily Perry, estimated she made \"close to 60 calls\" to Loxley before she received an email that was sent 12 days after the fire.\n\nThe email, as seen by the ABC, said Loxley would be \"progressively offering a full refund\" for events booked until the venue is able to operate \"to the standard which was promised\".\n\nIt said an insurance claim was submitted the Monday following the fire and Loxley had been \"working closely with our insurer to provide all required information\".\n\n\"The wording of the email was very vague,\" Emily said.\n\nRhys and Emily are paying off the invoice on another wedding venue after their original venue burnt down. (Supplied)\n\n\"They haven't really indicated as to whether we need to wait for the insurance to be approved, whether we're going to be contacted in the coming days or week.\n\n\"We've heard literally nothing else on when we're getting that [money back], we might not even be getting it for all we know, until next year.\"\n\nEmily and her fiance Rhys were due to marry in April and had paid off $20,000 on their invoice.\n\nShe has been trying to find out how soon their money will be returned, with the couple opting for another venue to save their planned wedding date.\n\n\"The date of my wedding is the anniversary of my grandmother's passing,\" she said.\n\n\"I was very close with her so having that date was super important to me by making sure that she's connected to the day.\"\n\nSo far Rhys and Emily have put down $8,000 towards another venue. (Supplied)\n\nSo far the couple has been able to put down $8,000 towards another venue, but Emily said the lack of correspondence surrounding the refund process \"makes us very anxious\".\n\n\"On top of the fire I did also get made redundant from work so obviously financially it's been a bit of a struggle,\" she said.\n\nShe said her fiance was also unable to work as he lived with multiple sclerosis (MS) and they would only scrape by on their next instalment.\n\nEmily said finding a new venue that aligned with her budget and date \"was an absolute miracle\".\n\n\"But knowing that dream wedding we had been planning shattered right in front of us was just devastating.\"\n\nIs wedding insurance worth considering?\n\nThere are only a handful of insurers in NSW that offer wedding insurance in the event of an unexpected disaster.\n\nSpecial Counsel at BlackBay Lawyers Dragan Gasic, who specialises in complex commercial disputes, said wedding insurance can cover anything from last-minute cancellations to damaged photographs.\n\n\"Wedding insurance protects people from financial losses due to events such as fires. It covers aspects like cancellation, postponement and even supply, for example photographers or caterers who don't turn up, damage to dresses from loss of rings,\" he said.\n\nMr Gasic said weddings carried a higher risk of financial loss as couples tended to spend a large amount of money.\n\n\"Read your contracts carefully and understand the terms and conditions,\" he said.\n\n\"If there's any questions or queries raise it with the venue and the insurer and find out what the limitations and exclusions are. More importantly, shop around.\"",

(ABC News: Baz Ruddick) A long-time skater who had drifted away from the sport for the last eight years or so, Mr MacAskill dusted off his old board after a park was built near his daughter's daycare.\n\n\"I put Skylah on the board. She was scared at first, but once she rolled down the ramp she didn't want to stop,\" he said.\n\n\"Within a week I was buying her a proper skateboard. That's where it all began,\" he said.\n\nSoon, his eldest daughter Ava swapped her scooter for a skateboard, and the family discovered Skate Mates \u2013 also known as Sk8 M8s. Now both girls are hooked \u2014 and so is their dad.\n\n\"Somehow I ended up with two skater girls I didn't [have to] push into it,\" he laughed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTownsville's Sk8 M8s group meets every week. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) \"It's definitely a great feeling skating together. We've got something in common, something to talk about ... it's a really good bonding experience.\"\n\nWhile Mr MacKaskill is known around Townsville for his signature backflips, the girls are getting the hang of dropping in.\n\nA drop in is when a skater balances their board on the edge of a ramp using their back foot and then pushes their weight on the front of the board to roll down onto it.\n\nAva said her first time dropping in on a ramp was daunting but with a bit of support from her dad she now feels comfortable. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nDaughter Ava said her first attempt at one was terrifying, but her dad helped her.\n\n\"I thought I was going to fall backwards, but Dad helped me and I didn't,\" she said.\n\n\"I love learning new tricks and big drop-ins.\"\n\nMore than tricks\n\n\n\n\n\nLeonie Johnson co-founded the Townsville skateboarding community Sk8 M8s which meets every week at different parks around the city. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) In 2019, Leonie Johnson saw a need for more support for skaters in Townsville and co-founded a weekly meet up group called Sk8 M8s.\n\nShe said all too often, skaters were seen as loiterers or troublemakers, and skate parks were perceived as intimidating and off-limits.\n\n\"We formed Sk8 M8s as a way of creating a safe space for skateboarders of all abilities [and] all ages, so they can come down and try it out and give it a go with support,\" Ms Johnson said.\n\n\n\n\"Some of the skaters we got to know in the community said they wanted to have more of a social [element] in skateboarding, because they felt it had some negative connotations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSk8 M8s co-founder Leonie Johnson said a strong and supportive Townsville skate community has developed in recent years. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) Four years on, Tuesday night Sk8 M8s sessions draw in toddlers, teenagers and adults to the city's major skate parks.\n\nFar from being banished, parents pull up camping chairs with a thermos to watch and cheer their kids on at the ramp.\n\n\"We're involving parents in some of that community aspect and we're starting our little ones younger,\" Ms Johnson said.\n\n\"I think it's really important ... we need parents to understand what the culture is like at a skate park, and not to be afraid of the skate park.\"\n\nShe said a lot of the more experienced skateboarders had become mentors, which helped the community develop.\n\n\n\n\n\nTownsville's Sk8 M8s group helps parents get involved with their kid's skateboarding progress. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick) \"More experienced skateboarders will step in in a really gentle way to give prompts to the younger and newer skaters,\" she said.\n\n\"It means they're learning exactly the way that skateboarding is always meant to be: it's grassroots and it's community and about learning from your peers.\"\n\nFor Ms Johnson, the lessons taught at the park go beyond landing a trick. Sk8 M8s places a strong emphasis on etiquette; getting back up after a fall, waiting your turn, respecting others, and sharing space with BMX and scooter riders, and even the occasional roller skater.\n\n\"Practice brings progress, not perfection. Not even Olympic skaters rock a perfect line every time,\" she said.\n\n\"You get knocked down and you stand back up and you give it another go. It's really important with our everyday life and what happens outside of the skate park as well.\"\n\nEvery week the MacAskill family joins other families at one of Townsville's skate parks for the Sk8 M8s meetup. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nAs Townsville's skate scene grows, Ms Johnson said the community she's helped foster is as rewarding as any medal or trophy.\n\n\"When our kids are at school, [parents] don't always get to see the kids achieving and learning ... whereas here they get to sit, to walk alongside them,\" she said.\n\n\"Seeing their own children start to really blossom and thrive \u2026 there's a real sense of pride and connection.\"\n\nA little push (with love)\n\nMr MacAskill said skateboarding was helping his daughters leave their comfort zones.\n\nSkylah became hooked on skateboarding when she discovered the skate park around the corner from her home. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\n\"They're going to be scared no matter what before they do a trick, so it's just about holding their hand and sort of pushing them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Once they have had that little thrill they'll go back to it again and they'll start to pick it up.\"\n\nAva recently made the switch from scooters to skateboards. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nHe said his daughters have started looking up to young female Olympic skateboarders like Sky Brown and Chloe Covell for inspiration.\n\n\"It'd definitely be cool if they pursue [competitive skateboarding], but if not we're still having good fun anyway,\" he said.",

It's overwhelming in a really, really good way,\" Ms Gordon Rock said.\n\n\"My parents have lots of Rone's paintings all over their house so for them, it is quite a cool thing to have their daughter painted by him.\"\n\nThe subjects range from a one-year-old baby to a 96-year-old with the aim of representing Geelong's cultural and social history.\n\n\"I'm trying to have that transition from birth to death \u2014 that evolution of people living in Geelong and evolving here and growing,\" Rone said.\n\nAbout 80 people applied to be featured in the convention centre's mural. (ABC News: Jonathon Kendall)\n\nGlobal artist's local link\n\nThe subjects were chosen because of their links to the Geelong region.\n\nRone too has close links to Geelong. He grew up 20 kilometres away on the Bellarine Peninsula and has built an international career.\n\nExploring themes of beauty and decay, he has created public art in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Berlin, London and Tokyo.\n\nThis portrait of 'Emma', a local chef, was painted in Gotthenburg, Sweden.

I didn't expect to see my face as big as it is \u2014 something I've already had comments about,\" Mr Mansfield said.\n\n\"All in all, there are a fair few folks who have seen it and I would imagine there will be a few more yet.\"\n\nKen Mansfield was surprised by the scale of the work. (Supplied)\n\nHe is grateful to his daughter, Lisa Cunningham, who nominated him and is impressed with the progress.\n\n\"Until it's finished, we won't get a full appreciation of what it's like but it's looking very good,\" he said.\n\n'Representing something so much bigger'\n\nProject managers Plenary Conventions say Nyaal Banyul, meaning \"open your eyes to the hills\" in the Wadawurrung language, is the first convention centre in Australia designed from inception with traditional owners.\n\nThe centre is intended to encourage visitors to \"look deeply and appreciate the landscapes and history of Wadawurrung Country\".\n\nHalf of the 14 faces on the mural will be representatives of the seven Wadawurrung family lines, whose country stretches between Ballarat, Beaufort, Geelong, Torquay, Aireys inlet and Werribee.\n\nThe mural is on the back of Geelong's new convention centre on Smythe Street. (ABC News: Jonathon Kendall)\n\nOne of the Wadawurrung people featured is Danae Coots, who hasn't had her portrait painted on the wall yet.\n\nShe describes herself as shy and daunted by the prospect of being immortalised on a massive mural in the heart of Geelong.\n\n\"It took a lot for me to get to this stage. I'm doing this not as an individual \u2014 yes [it] will be my face up there, but my face is up there representing something so much bigger,\" Ms Coots said.\n\n\"I have a large and proud family right behind me. I'm here representing my family of the past, my family who are here with me today, and my family of the future.\"\n\nThe Indigenous influence extends to the colours being used. Rone was inspired by blue ochre used by Wadawurrung people.\n\nWadawurrung woman Danae Coots says the painting will represent her past, present and future family. (ABC News: Jonathon Kendall)\n\n\"We had to mix something like 126 colours to begin with and then just keep reducing them down to have seven tones for each portrait,\" the artist said.\n\n\"We ended up with a palette reduced down to 56 colours but if you look at the wall it feels like it's two tones,\" he said.\n\nThe mural is due to be finished next month and the convention centre is scheduled to open in July next year. It's something Ms Coots is excited about.\n\n\"I'll be looking forward to coming down here with my family, my children in particular,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm not sure how they are going to feel about their mum's face being so large, but hopefully it's something they'll take some pride in.\"",

    "text": "Nearly 9000 kilometres is a long way to travel for a high-vis photo opportunity in front of a giant infrastructure project.\n\nBut on the final day of Jacinta Allan's whistle stop-tour of China, the premier did just that, standing in front of tunnel being dug under the city of Deyang in Sichuan province in the south-west of the country.\n\nIt had many of the hallmarks of a suburban press event in Melbourne.\n\nIn China, Ms Allan proudly announced her pet project back home, the Suburban Rail Loop (SRL), had ordered four more tunnel boring machines from a Chinese manufacturer whose machines have also been digging in Sichuan.\n\nThe SRL authority has purchased four new tunnel boring machines in China. (Supplied: Victoria government)\n\nBut it is unlikely the Victorian government would have enjoyed the cost comparison between the Chengdu SRL and Melbourne's rail project.\n\nThe 40-kilometre section of the Chinese rail project is being built for $US1.2 billion ($AUD1.8 billion) in under four years.\n\nMeanwhile, the first stage of Melbourne's SRL is estimated to cost $34.5 billion for 26 kilometres of twin tunnels, and is projected to be operational by 2035 \u2014 13 years of construction. That price tag includes new stations, fit out and trains. China's $1.8bn is just the line construction but it's still remarkably cheaper.\n\n\"It tells us we have so much that we can learn,\" Ms Allan told reporters.\n\nAside from the tunnel photo opportunity, the premier's week in China revealed some of state's strategic ambitions with its largest trading partner.\n\nThe entrance to a rail tunnel in Deyang, Sichuan province, China. (Supplied: Victorian government)\n\nA week of high-level networking\n\nThroughout the week-long trip Ms Allan met with province governors and China's national education minister.\n\nIt is important access and a sign of respect which will help businesses and government strike future deals.\n\nJacinta Allan has spent a week in China meeting government and business authorities. (Supplied: Victorian government)\n\nMuch of the operation was about facilitating trade opportunities, and the state has a series of trade officers throughout China with full-time staff working to get Victorian products and businesses into China's vast market.\n\nThe China strategy Ms Allan launched on Monday night does not have a lot of concrete policy outcomes but it set the tone for ongoing trade talks.\n\nWhere it does make explicit its ambitions is to increase Chinese students numbers in Victoria \u2014 a challenge given the federal government's student cap.\n\nBut experts say fixing Victoria's problems are more pressing.\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan has been accompanied by several other Labor MPs and a travelling press pack from Melbourne. (Supplied: Victorian government)\n\nSwinburne University China expert John Fitzgerald told The Australian newspaper that reducing Victoria's rising crime rate would help boost Melbourne's credentials as a destination.\n\n\"Victoria has quality [education] providers, but the state's falling reputation for personal safety and security of property is under close critical scrutiny in Chinese-language media, much as it is in mainstream media,\" he told the newspaper.\n\n\"Any Victorian government planning to sell Victoria as the education state will have to deal first with its growing reputation as the crime state. The answer to that lies at home, not touring China.\"\n\nTackling that problem will also help her ambitions to double Chinese tourism to Victoria over the next five years.\n\nThe government is throwing plenty of promotional cash at the plan and has recruited popular local social media influencers.\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan was joined by singer Wu Chun, who is partnering with the Victorian government to promote tourism. (Instagram)\n\nWu Chun, a Bruneian singer who attended a Visit Victoria event and took a photo with the Ms Allan, declared himself \"Mr Melbourne\" to his nearly 13 million followers.\n\nAllan pursues China amid complexity\n\nMaking Melbourne attractive in advertising is one thing, but making it attractive in reality is another.\n\nThe week-long mission was full of positive news, and was a great opportunity for Ms Allan and a small caucus of backbenchers to take selfies and photos to show off to Chinese Victorian constituents.\n\nVoters struggling with cost-of-living and crime fears are unlikely to be thrilled with the pictures or the price tag.\n\nA trip for Allan, her staff and a team of government officials would have cost taxpayers ten of thousands of dollars. The ABC and other travelling media paid their own way.\n\nJacinta Allan has visited a zoo in Sichuan province, south-western China. (Supplied: Victorian government)\n\nThere are also outstanding questions about whether Ms Allan's affinity with China will mean voters continue to associate her with the former premier Daniel Andrews, whose legacy has damaged by his recent trip to the superpower.\n\nMr Andrews was always supportive of China, and his relationship and status has clearly been valued in Beijing, given he was invited to President Xi Jinping's big parade earlier this month.\n\nPandas were on the itinerary on day 5 of the premier's trip. (Supplied: Victorian government)\n\nMr Andrew's foray back into the spotlight was problematic for Australia's foreign policy, which walks a narrow path between economic co-operation and security concerns.\n\nMs Allan won't comment on foreign policy, because that's Canberra's job, but by visiting China she is stepping into a very complex relationship.\n\nOne that she believes, and hopes, will continue to be good for the state.",

    "text": "Welcome to Cheat Sheet, where we give you all the intel you need about iconic shows your friends have been bugging you to watch! In honour of the recent announcement of its imminent reboot and the hospital procedural being back in fashion after The Pitt's Emmy wins, this month we're looking at beloved medical sitcom Scrubs.\n\nIt was at the inception of Scrubs that creator and show runner Bill Lawrence solidified his \"no assholes\" rule on set.\n\nFast facts about Scrubs What: A hospital procedural show with the right mix of realism, narrative and surreal comedy Starring: Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalk, Ken Jenkins, John C McGinley, Judy Reyes, Neil Flynn Created by: Bill Lawrence (Ted Lasso, Shrinking) Where: Available to stream on Stan and Disney+ (but if you can get your hands on DVDs that's even better) Likely to make you feel: Like you're part of a hilarious family\n\n\"[It's] one thing that got burned into my head from personal experience,\" he said in a 2009 interview.\n\n\"I am not going to ever work with or promote the careers of people that act shitty to people who are beneath them on the totem pole.\"\n\nHe didn't want the people he made TV with walking on eggshells; rather, he simply wanted everyone to come to work and be nice to each other.\n\nIt's an ethos that spilled into his then-new medical comedy \u2014 Scrubs, which was about to reinvigorate the hospital sitcom with undeniable proof that you can balance realistic medical drama with surreal humour and genuine heart.\n\nLawrence's future shows, too, would become known for their cockle-warming abilities.\n\nEverything you need to know about Ted Lasso, the charming sports comedy with 20 Emmy nominations Photo shows A 40-something man with a moustache smiles while seated at a press conference in front of one red and one green microphone. With 20 Emmy nominations, this is the heartfelt comedy you need to catch up on.\n\nHis kindness-first attitude shone the brightest in soccer comedy Ted Lasso, which was universally praised for its undeniable niceness in every episode. It garnered 20 Emmy nominations in its first season \u2014 more than any new show in the awards' history, at the time \u2014 and walked away with seven statues.\n\nShrinking, Lawrence's examination of grief and humour through the eyes of a therapist enjoyed a similar critical reception and a swathe of awards.\n\nBut Scrubs, despite being off-air now for 15 years, takes up a particularly special space in the minds of fans.\n\nCreator Bill Lawrence (left) at the 2018 Scrubs cast reunion. (Getty: Joe Scarnici)\n\nFrom 2001 to 2010, Scrubs navigated a changing sitcom landscape, being turfed by its network, enduring the 2007 writers strikes and an ill-fated ninth season with a brand new cast. In 2025, it still has a firm grip on a loyal fanbase \u2014 just look at Zach Braff and Donald Faison's hugely popular Scrubs rewatch podcast.\n\nThis year, fans' prayers have been answered with US network ABC announcing a Scrubs reboot. Most of the show's core cast \u2014 including Braff and Faison \u2014 are confirmed to be returning to a season that's slated for 2025-2026 US TV season.\n\nHere's what you need to know before we re-enter the world of Scrubs.\n\nWhat is Scrubs about?\n\nScrubs follows the lives of the medical staff at Sacred Heart Hospital.\n\nProtagonist JD (Braff) is a 20-something intern terrified to enter the workforce, alongside his long-time best friend and surgeon-in-training, Turk (Faison), and neurotic internal medicine intern Elliot (Sarah Chalk).\n\nNeil Flynn's janitor character (centre) became a main cast member because Lawrence loved his work so much. (Getty: Chris Haston/Disney General Entertainment Content)\n\nRounding out the main cast are belaboured nurse Carla (Judy Reyes), hardened resident Dr Cox (a terrifying John C. McGinley), checked-out Chief of Medicine Dr Kelso (Ken Jenkins) and Janitor (Neil Flynn), the hospital's delightfully unhinged custodian who never reveals his name.\n\nJD's internal monologue runs throughout the show. It serves as both narration and a portal to the more surreal comedy of Scrubs; his absurd daydreams frequently puncture the real world action, as the core characters navigate the demands of a public hospital (the show was filmed in a real abandoned hospital, giving it a grimy realism).\n\nAdding colour to Sacred Heart is a revolving cast of supporting characters from sad sack lawyer Ted (Sam Lloyd, RIP) and his ever-present acapella band, to Dr Mickhead (Frank Cameron), who began life as a throwaway punchline (you'll never guess what the interns call him).\n\nAlthough superficially a sitcom, Lawrence reinforces his comedic foundations with poignant, but never sappy, ruminations on the fragility of life, the importance of community and the impossible tasks asked of healthcare professionals.\n\nThe Impact of Scrubs\n\nIn a sea of dramas, comedies and reality shows set in hospitals, Scrubs often rises to the top in terms of accuracy. Although Scrubs ended in 2010 after nine seasons, a 2006 episode titled My Cabbage went viral during the COVID-19 pandemic for its simple, visual explanation of how infections spread.\n\nDuring its run, Scrubs writers were praised for not just seeking the consultation of real doctors, but because the show accurately represented the heartbreaking reality for those working within America's strained healthcare system.\n\nThe Pitt, Adolescence and The Studio win big at the Emmys Photo shows A woman and two men pose with Emmy awards The Pitt wins Best Drama at the 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, with The Studio, Adolescence and even Stephen Colbert walking away as the biggest winners of the night.\n\nPatients are bumped from medical trials in favour of hospital donors, best efforts are thwarted by death's power, colleagues break under pressure and then come back to do it all again tomorrow.\n\nThrough it all, Lawrence made sure to shine a spotlight on the invaluable relationships formed within hospitals in order to deal with it all.\n\nThe real situations, real relationship formula echoes in television even to this day in more dramatic fare like The Pitt, which just picked up the Emmy for Best Drama \u2014 and paved the way for a Scrubs reference.\n\nScrubs was also responsible for elevating numerous musical artists with their deft music supervision. Lawrence encouraged cast and crew to submit their favourite songs, with Braff and cast member Christa Miller selecting a number of tracks.\n\nWhen Scrubs moved to streaming platforms fans were quick to notice that much of the music had changed from the original broadcast.\n\nBraff confirmed in a now-deleted Tweet that this was due to the broadcast music licences not extending to streaming services, highlighting the ongoing issues with streamers and music licensing.\n\nIn a 2024 interview with LA Times, Lawrence said he was committed to having the original music restored.\n\nFive essential Scrubs episodes\n\nMy Old Lady (Season 1, Episode 4)\n\nThis early series episode opens with a shocking statistic: one in every three patients admitted to a hospital will die. Then we cap cut to Turk, JD and Elliot welcoming three new patients to Sacred Heart.\n\nAs wobbly interns, our core three try to do best by their patents, but they make some misguided decisions, all while the spectre of death hangs over the audience. With My Old Lady, Scrubs established itself early as a sitcom that was going to rip your heart out.\n\nMy Screw Up (Season 3, Episode 14)\n\nScrubs had its fair share of A-List guest stars, including Colin Farrell, Elizabeth Banks and Michael J Fox. But ask any fan their favourite and good chances they'll tell you it was a peak early-career Brendan Fraser as Dr Cox's brother in law/best friend, Ben.\n\nMy Screw Up is not Fraser\u2019s first time guest starring but it contains some of his most brilliant work as goofy, stubborn, immature, loveable Ben. Just be careful how deeply you fall in love with him. Let\u2019s just say, you\u2019ll never hear Winter by Joshua Radin the same way again.\n\nMy Life in Four Cameras (Season 4, Episode 17)\n\nScrubs is not a traditional sitcom, which is why it's so delicious to see it be treated as one in this very special episode. Sitcom mega-fans Turk and JD freak out when (fake) Cheers writer Charles James is admitted to the hospital.\n\nAfter finding out his diagnosis is more serious than first thought, the dull realism is flipped to a colourful, multi-camera set up where all the women are in skimpy skirts and the biggest problem is winning $27,000 at the big hospital talent quest. Scrubs cheekily ribs the cheery optimism of the TV of yore, while reminding the audience that it's because life can be unfair and depressing that we need happy-ending sitcoms.\n\nMy Lunch (Season 5, Episode 20)\n\nWatch the new season of The Assembly on ABC iview Photo shows A young person holding a microphone standing amongst audience. Leigh Sales returns to mentor a new cohort of autistic journalism students from across the country as they interview some of Australia's favourite celebrities.\n\nThroughout the whole series, Dr Cox is established as not just JD's mentor (as much as he denies it) but as the paternal figure that watches over Sacred Heart's workers. Yes, he constantly berates those around him and is stubborn to a fault, but he is also fiercely protective of his underlings, and always ready with an answer that serves the ultimate good.\n\nMy Lunch deals with the sticky conundrum of what happens when the infallible make an honest mistake. The first two acts of the episode are stuffed with Scrubs' regular humour but it's the final act, with a stunning performance from John C. McGinley, that elevates the episode to must-see.\n\nMy Musical (Season 6, Episode 6)\n\nMany shows have attempted musical episodes. Many have failed. Scrubs is not one of these shows. Already so sharp when it came to music supervision, the show one-upped itself by pulling off a full Broadway-style musical with the help of Avenue Q luminaries Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez. Through the eyes of a patient with a mysterious neurological condition that causes her to see everything in song, Scrubs rolls out banger after banger on everything from stool samples to maternity leave to guy love.\n\nTender, hilarious and an opportunity for the more musically-inclined cast members to show off their talents, there is a reason this episode was nominated for five Emmys.",

    "text": "Runnicles brought forth the gently surging pulsations of the opening with quiet buoyancy, and the ensuing woodwind idea entered brightly but at a distance. The violins, under concertmaster Andrew Haveron introduced more urgent animation and captured a point of vertiginous intensity at the climactic point of the phrase, as though arriving at a breathtaking panorama.\n\nDonald Runnicles and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra gave a glowing performance of Sibelius\u2019s Symphony No. 2, shaping its abundant melodic riches with warmth and an astute understanding of the way its lapidary structure unfolds. This is a work whose revelations creep up on you, like an unexpected tree or vista on a walk, only to recede just as quickly.\n\nThe slow movement was dark but never self-indulgent. The portentous bassoon solo (Matthew Wilkie) emerged over the top of an almost inaudible plucked tread from cellos and basses as though a thought had suddenly crystallised. But perhaps the symphony\u2019s most beautiful moment was the oboe theme (Shefali Pryor) ushered into the middle section of the third movement, which, up to this point had bristled with scurrying energy from the strings.\n\nThis melody is of such disarmingly simple beauty, one scarcely notices that it is built on themes of the first movement, including the symphony\u2019s opening notes. This is perhaps the kind of integration Sibelius was referring to when he later remarked to Gustav Mahler that what he liked about symphonic works was the profound logic that created an inner connection between its motives (Mahler famously answered, \u201cNo, the symphony must be like the world\u201d).\n\nFor the finale, Sibelius conceived two imposing but contrasting ideas, the first of surging exaltation, the second of implacable sternness and quiet resolve that grows to become overwhelming. Runnicles guided both so that the expressiveness was exhilarating, but never over-inflated.\n\nThe danger of arriving at the closing passages with the feeling that all the fireworks have already been let off, which is sometimes a problem with this work in less experienced hands, was avoided here and the performance closed in radiant magnificence.\n\nBefore this, Runnicles and the SSO articulated the tempestuous outer textures and tender contrasting cor anglais melody (Alexandre Oguey) of Wagner\u2019s Overture to the Flying Dutchman with musicianly care, moulding brass chords carefully so the turbulence was incisive but not allowed to unbalance the texture or run amok. The program is repeated on Friday and Saturday with the added bonus of mezzo-soprano Sasha Cook in Elgar\u2019s Sea Pictures.",

    "text": "However, KKR group boss Mysore explained in an exclusive interview with this masthead that he and other potential investors would want an exclusive window for all players to appear in the entire BBL tournament, plus the right to rename and rebrand teams to give them higher visibility in India. Loading He said any overlap between Test cricket and the T20 league would be a red line for many potential investors. This would leave Cricket Australia with a huge challenge around how to structure the summer while preserving the things that matter to Australian cricket fans; the Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Tests. Mysore said it was unlikely that Indian investors with IPL teams in their stables would be content to buy into the BBL as passive participants. They would want a say in the name and branding of the teams, player availability, match timeslots and calendar windows.\n\n\u201cSustained interest in the league will depend on the availability of all local and foreign players,\u201d Mysore said. \u201cThe two key components are a dedicated window, without any clashes with other leagues, and full availability of local players.\u201d However, there is a contrast between investors, like KKR group or Mumbai Indians group \u2013 owned by the multi-billionaire Ambani family \u2013 and so-called \u201ctech titans\u201d based in the United States. A group of these tech moguls recently paid $300 million for a 49 per cent stake in the London Spirit franchise based at Lord\u2019s. Some investors may be content simply to buy in because of the prestige. But already, the Hundred has been criticised by new franchise owners because the ECB rested some Test players from the early rounds following their exhausting drawn Test series against India.\n\nAt the same time, franchises are in the process of being renamed. BBL clubs, such as the Melbourne Stars and Sydney Sixers, have been described as \u201ctrophy assets\u201d that investors will want to buy into simply to be associated with legendary venues, such as the MCG, SCG or Adelaide Oval. The continued appeal of the BBL was on show at Ninja Stadium in January when Mitch Owen powered the Hobart Hurricanes to victory over Sydney Thunder to claim the title.

That is certainly the case for KKR, who would want to have a team named Melbourne or Sydney Knight Riders, branded in the group\u2019s purple and gold colours, and involving players like Sunil Narine, who already have year-round deals with KKR.\n\n\u201cKnight Riders were the first to conceive of and execute on a global brand strategy,\u201d Mysore said. \u201cIt has become a genuine global brand that has also globalised our fan base.\u201d CA says the Big Bash League is in good health, though still down on its peak season in 2016, when more than 80,000 people turned up for a Stars-Renegades derby at the MCG. AT the peak of its popularity, the BBL drew 80,000 fans to the MCG for a Melbourne derby in January 2016. Credit: Daniel Pockett - CA/Cricket Australia via Getty Images In those days, the BBL was seen as the world\u2019s second-best T20 league behind the IPL, but since then, the franchise market has exploded. There are now major leagues in South Africa and the UAE competing for players at the same time as the BBL, in addition to those in India, the West Indies, England and the United States.\n\nThis growth has provided unprecedented opportunities for players to make millions, and demonstrated how much private capital is potentially available to cricket in Australia, should CA and the states finally decide to take the plunge. CA says the windfall would help supercharge the Big Bash, including a handsome increase to the salary cap to keep the best players from absconding to other leagues, and flow through to the grassroots. \u201cMy experience with privately owned teams is, if done right, it\u2019s a really good thing for the sport,\u201d said Australian Test captain Pat Cummins, who was purchased by Sunrisers Hyderabad at the 2024 IPL auction $3.7 million. \u201cYou look at an IPL team that\u2019s privately funded, and the amount they put into the team and programs, they do their own development camps and their own talent pathway and academies.\n\n\u201cOur IPL team we have a social media team of about 30 people who travel around, so there\u2019s things that can get unlocked that make the experience better for fans. Then the big question is how do you use those funds to make sure that cricket\u2019s in a really good spot and supporting community cricket as well as professional cricket.\u201d But these leagues are not without their problems. The SAT20 is the third attempt by Cricket South Africa to grow a healthy franchise competition, jointly owned by pay TV service Supersport and a conglomerate of Indian investors. South Africa\u2019s wider economic struggles, particularly in terms of the value of the Rand, is costing millions for team owners each year. Mysore was not shy in saying that there is something of a bubble about the growth of franchise leagues, up to and including the lofty sums paid for teams in the Hundred. \u201cThe financial viability in the medium to long term is a very important component,\u201d Mysore said. \u201cIn the event that leagues are not financially viable, the future of those leagues will be questioned.\u201d\n\nThe BBL is an attractive proposition for investors, given its history of relative financial success and the fact it is underpinned by Cricket Australia\u2019s place as one of the \u201cbig three\u201d nations alongside India and England. But much of the BBL\u2019s strength has derived from taking a very different approach to the franchise model. The tournament co-exists with Test cricket, especially around Boxing Day and New Year, and does not rely on the presence of Cummins, Travis Head or Mitchell Starc playing its full duration. Mysore with established Knight Riders player Sunil Narine. Credit: NurPhoto via Getty Images In turn, that has allowed the Australian Test team to perform at a consistently high level with minimal disruption from the T20 circuit. It\u2019s a dynamic that relies upon a shared sense of purpose between Cricket Australia and the states, who control the BBL teams. CA\u2019s chief executive Todd Greenberg and chair Mike Baird have met with their state association counterparts over the past two weeks in attempts to thrash out details of a potential sale, but are yet to reach consensus. The states hold 30-year licences to the clubs, with a 15-year review clause that comes into effect next year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re considering,\u201d Baird told this masthead. \u201cIf you did consider private investment, what are the key criteria we would keep. \u201cTo individual teams and owners and what they might want, any sort of criteria, that is for us to consider and set the criteria. If we want to make the decision to consider private investment, it would be done on our terms, and done collectively. \u201cThe risks and challenges we\u2019ve seen across the world. The beauty is we can take the best of that and put in the terms and conditions that are important to Australian cricket.\u201d Mysore has fond memories of watching Test matches in his hometown of Chennai every January, and respects the traditions of Boxing Day and New Year Tests in Australia.\n\nBut that respect will not stop Mysore and others from asking questions before they decide whether to buy a franchise. In the UK, team owners have pushed for the separate sale of broadcast rights for the Hundred, away from international cricket, so that the value of the tournament is more clearly known. While the big broadcast numbers attracted by the Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Tests are widely thought to aid the audiences for BBL games in the evenings, franchise owners will want to know which is helping which. Baird has stressed that CA and the states must retain control of whatever privatisation model is ultimately agreed. A decision is expected before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we\u2019d want to control the schedule,\u201d Baird said. \u201cSo that Test cricket remains an essential part of the Australian summer.\u201d Cummins said other nations would love to have the commercially successful Test series seen here. \u201cIt is a different model to a lot of other countries, but I think it\u2019s a better model,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wish they could have five Test matches sold out and everyone watched as well as the BBL. \u201cIt\u2019s great we\u2019ve got two tournaments that can run concurrently and there\u2019s a place for both of them.\u201d The global strategy becomes still more attractive if Indian players are available to play outside the IPL. So far, the BCCI has rebuffed inquiries by franchise owners about allowing more freedom of movement, but the recent decision of champion off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin to quit the IPL and go \u201cglobal\u201d, potentially to the BBL this summer, shows that the mood is gradually shifting.\n\nMysore declined to comment on whether Indian players would be more freely available to play in overseas leagues in the future, but Baird said this week he was in constant discussions about the matter with Indian authorities. Loading The BBL was effectively bankrolled in its first two years by CA\u2019s slice of the cash from the short-lived T20 Champions League. But in 2013 CA signed a deal with Ten for the tournament for about $100 million over five years. That figure grew again as part of a $1.18 billion overall deal with Foxtel and Seven in 2018, before the current $1.5 billion agreement was signed in 2023. Franchise owners will want a percentage of the broadcast rights value from any future deals. In the meantime, plenty have conveyed their interest to Cummins, over numerous seasons of the IPL. \u201cThree or four of the IPL owners have been like, \u2018oh we\u2019d love to get involved\u2019,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cA lot of Indian fans, they\u2019ve grown up watching Australian cricket teams, and they hold Australian cricket in such high regard that the BBL is, in their eyes, a really attractive league they want to be a part of, and they want to be linked to Australian cricket.\u201d",

    "text": "Some of Europe's busiest airports including London's Heathrow have been affected by a cyber attack against a provider of check-in and boarding systems, causing flight delays and cancellations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrussels Airport, Berlin Airport were both affected while Dublin Airport said it was also facing minor impact from the issue, along with Cork Airport, Ireland's second biggest after Dublin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels, dozens of flight departures and arrivals were cancelled, aviation data provider Cirium said. Officials in Brussels said there had been four flight diversions, as well as \"delays on most of the departing flights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBrussels Airport said it had asked airlines to cancel half of their scheduled departing flights on Sunday to avoid long queues and late cancellations, signalling that the disruption would continue through the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disruption is the latest in a string of hacks targeting governments and companies across the world, hitting sectors from healthcare and defence to retail and autos. A recent breach at luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover brought its production to a halt.\n\n\n\nWhat was impacted in the cyberattack?\n\nThe attack affected the MUSE software made by Collins Aerospace, which provides systems for several airlines at airports globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aviation tech company, which specialises in digital and data processing services, is a subsidiary of the American aerospace and defence group RTX, formerly known as Raytheon.\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX said it was aware of a \"cyber-related disruption\" to the software at selected airports, without naming them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,\" RTX said in a statement, adding that it was working to fix the issue as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nPeople stand in a line to check in after the attack caused delays at Brussels International Airport. Source: AP / Harry Nakos A European Commission spokesperson said there were currently no indications of a \"widespread or severe attack\" and that the origin of the incident was still under investigation.\n\n\n\nWho was behind the attack?\n\nRTX did not give any information on who might be behind the attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese kinds of sweeping outages are typically the result either of ransomware attacks, where online extortionists paralyse corporate networks in the hope of payment, or deliberate digital sabotage.\n\n\n\n\n\nRafe Pilling, director of threat intelligence at cybersecurity company Sophos, said the impact of the incident highlighted \"the fragile and interdependent nature of the digital ecosystem underpinning air travel\".\n\n\n\n\"We've seen huge impact across retail and currently automotive in the UK this year,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The threat is significant and very real.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral breach-tracking websites have previously said that Collins Aerospace was hit by ransom-seeking hackers in 2023.\n\n\n\nAviation industry 'prime target' for cyber attacks\n\nCyber attacks and tech outages have disrupted airports around the world in recent years, from Japan to Germany, as air travel increasingly relies on online, interconnected systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aviation sector saw a 600 per cent increase in cyber attacks from 2024 to 2025, according to a report by French aerospace company Thales released in June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From airlines and airports to navigation systems and suppliers, every link in the chain is vulnerable to attack,\" the report warned, pointing out that the strategically and economically important sector had become a \"prime target\" for cyber attacks.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Fed up with flight delays? Passengers could soon get refunds under new scheme\n\nAviation expert Anita Mendiratta, who is also a special adviser to the secretary general of UN tourism, told Agence France-Presse it was difficult to know who was behind the attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she stressed it was \"a disruption caused to a software not a specific airport\" and it was important to try to \"contain the contagion\".\n\n\n\n",

It is kind of how I start the day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Lindsay is a customer of Asha Tea House in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe owner is David Lau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So matcha is a stone milled green tea. It's actually a tea powder and instead of drinking an infusion of the tea leaf with hot water, you're consuming the entire leaf.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GS Haly Company is one of the organisations that supplies matcha to shops like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Tea Buyer Aaron Vick says matcha has traditionally been used in Japanese tea ceremonies, but now is being mass-consumed in drinks and desserts across the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Matcha has long been an important ingredient for baked goods, for confectionary, candies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, matcha has been hailed as a superfood, splashed across social media in bright green lattes, and embraced by cafes from Tokyo to Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently however, Aaron Vick says there have been issues brewing on the horizon: because this year\u2019s harvest simply can\u2019t keep up with the global craze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is limited supply, not due to lack of innovation or ambition, but simply there's only so much tea grown in Japan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron says these supply issues, coupled with the popularity of matcha itself, has seen prices spike.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, prices for matcha are surging worldwide, with Japanese matcha, known for its quality, set to jump by up to 70 percent this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've always been saying matcha is growing, but certainly within the last one or two years there has been exponential unprecedented growth in demand.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lau can attest to that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The price has skyrocketed. For us it's more than doubled; and we weren't expecting that at all. Our matcha drinks, we sell them in the hundreds every day. And we go through many hundreds of kilograms every month or two. Yeah, it's a lot of matcha.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry Tiscornia teaches traditional Japanese tea service lessons - and he has also seen a change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My wife and I teach privately weekly and we have students that come and learn how to do the tea ceremony. People are going at these tea stores and they're limited to like one small 20-gram can. But one year ago you could go in and buy hundreds of grams of tea. So it's very bizarre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spike in pricing is being fuelled by poor weather in Japan, as well as labour shortages in both Japan and China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Japanese government has been trying to help, offering support to tea growers through funding, equipment - and even counselling - to encourage a shift from regular sencha tea to matcha.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2008, production of tencha, the leaf used to make matcha, has nearly tripled - and exports to the US now account for about a third of Japan\u2019s total tea exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut whether that's enough remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron Vick says says US tariffs are adding even more pressure: there's 15 percent duties now on Japanese matcha and nearly 38 percent on matcha from China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cost increases that we have been discussing up to now have been purely derived from supply and demand situation and the shortage of available leaf against the sudden extreme popularity of matcha. Additional to that, we will also certainly see an increase in price due to tariffs.\"\n\n\n\n",

Not only a brother, he was my best friend when he died. I was only 13 when he died but he used to be more a confidant and I would go everywhere with him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMemories of a much-loved brother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had some good times, even though I was so young. We used to go tenpin bowling, to the movies and that together. Even with his girlfriend he would take me along.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDecades later the pain is still raw for John Santi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because he was only 19 when he died...yeah, I miss him so much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn's brother Tony Santi died in a motorcycle accident in Tasmania in the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut raw grief has come up again this year for John and his family.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's when they found out his brother's brain had been removed without consent at an autopsy after his death, and kept as part of a collection at the Rodda Museum at the University of Tasmania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the hardest parts is having to rebury him, so he's been burried twice. After 50 years I had to rebury his body part. That happened about three weeks ago. We went and laid that to rest with him. That's something we should never have had to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Santi's brother wasn't the only person treated in this way.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Tasmanian coronial investigation recently released its final report, confirming 177 samples had been kept by the museum without permission.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report stated that human specimens were collected, and in some cases publicly displayed, by the University of Tasmania for decades without the knowledge or consent of families.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe museum collected the remains from coronial autopsies from 1966 to 1991 for teaching and research purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeg Webb is the Independent Member for Nelson in Tasmania.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says her office has been contacted by a number of Tasmanian families affected by this situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They've been re-traumatised because often the circumstances of their loved ones death was very traumatic and unpleasant in the first place and this has bought all that back to them. Then to have to go through a formal process of perhaps identifying that they are the correct relatives and then also having to make arrangements of what's going to happen with their loved ones remains, has been really gruelling. I really feel for those Tasmanian families and I don't think we've arrived at the end of the process yet because I don't think we've achieved appropriate accountability for how and why this happened.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation, led by coroner Simon Cooper, found the handling of the remains was not in accordance with national standards, which he said were set up in 2002 but not acted upon by the Tasmanian government.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appeared previous coroners were unaware the specimens had been distributed to the museum, coroner Simon Cooper said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that the belated discovery that human remains were removed at autopsy and not returned to the body had been a source of pain and anger for many families.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appeared one now-deceased forensic pathologist, Dr Royal Cummings, provided most of the specimens to the museum, with some of his predecessors and successors also engaged in the practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the conclusion of his report Coroner Cooper said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The retention of human remains without family or coronial approval, or even knowledge, is an historic practice out of keeping with, and offensive to, contemporary standards and values. It is inconceivable to my mind that it would ever happen again although the fact that the practice continued for as long as it did and ended only comparatively recently is also almost equally inconceivable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Webb says she has written to the Tasmanian Attorney General asking for two specific things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One is a state apology to the Tasmanian families that have been impacted by this situation, and also a commitment to continue an investigation into any breach of law that occurred during this process, so that we can know about any individuals or institutions that need to be held accountable for breaking the law here. I think that that's something that the families affected deserve to know and would provide appropriate closure to this situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remains in question were removed from public display in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coroner's office had spent years reconciling records to determine their origin.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January, the names of 126 people whose specimens had been identified were published online and family members urged to come forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coroner said 100 specimens had been identified and disposed of in line with the wishes of families.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sally Wasef is a forensic research fellow in Paleogenetics at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says institutions now need ethical clearance and clear permission to obtain human remains, but this hasn't always been the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it was common practice in the olden days that people would think that they can keep some of the remains because they are either colonial or unidentified. That would give them the rights to keep them for research on scientific purposes. I think they can justify to themselves that you know they are benefiting the community and they're not doing any harm basically and allowing medical students or other researchers to have a go to advance a cure, or look more into diseases or cause of death. Even if it's good intentions, it's not the right way of doing things, it's unethical.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Wasef says there are now clear national standards introduced in 2001 about how human remains can be obtained for medical research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most of the universities now have what is called body farms which is basically a specific location inside the universities where there are bodies that have been donated by the person before their death to research. And they do all of the research based on those remains that have been donated for the purpose.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Wasef also works closely with Indigenous communites helping them to identify human remains that were stolen in previous decades and centuries - when such practices were widespread.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike John Santi, Dr Wasef says the Indigenous communities affected want to see their ancestors laid to rest once and for all.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of those remains are still being held in museums in Australia and other parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Indigenous Australians believe that the remains are not going to rest if they are in the wrong country which means you have to specifically identify the right community that you return those remains to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Wasef says the unauthorised collection of human remains - whether those of close relatives or those of people who have been dead for thousands of years - is not only a legal and ethical issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe believes for some individuals and cultures it's also a spiritual one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am originally Egyptian and it hurts me every time I see a mummy displayed because this defeats the purpose of mummification. Mummification was meant to give those people an afterlife and we take them off place and display them. That's how I feel every time I see those mummies displayed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCloser to home, Meg Webb wants says the Coroner's report is really just a starting point for investigating further what has occurred in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's probably a need here for a wholesale review in every state of Australia to look at whether there are still instances where there's been inappropriate handling and storage and perhaps display of people's remains without consent and to really dig out how that's occurred and put measures in place to ensure it cannot happen again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Santi also wants to see more done to make sure people don't have to go through what has happened to his family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm just glad my mum and dad have passed (died) so they didn't have to go through all this\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Tasmania\u2019s Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Health Professor Graeme Zosky, has said in a statement the University is deeply sorry for the sadness and hurt felt by family members affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity staff had also met personally with many families seeking further information, and the university is also carefully considering the Coroner\u2019s report to determine any further actions.\n\n\n\n",

And there are also those where donors cannot be found.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe encouraged all Australians to donate, and emphasised that one group could be particularly helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Young Australians are really the key part here in terms of stem cells, the healthiest and the most populous stem cells are when you are between 18 to 35,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhat's it like donating stem cells?\n\nStavreski said there are misconceptions about donating stem cells, as some people may have an outdated understanding of how the procedure works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the past, the stem cells were taken from the hip bone. That's no longer the case; there isn't the pain that comes along with it,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Engineered stem cells breakthrough could save lives SBS News 03:20 English\n\nHe explained that stem cell donations are not as invasive as they used to be and are now \"quite simple\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is like donating blood from one arm. The blood will come out, a machine will separate the cells, and the remaining blood will go through to the other arm. It only takes 30 minutes to 60 minutes for the entire process,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't need any other needles or any anaesthetic.\"\n\n\n\nDiverse donors needed\n\nWhen determining which stem cells will be most effective in treatment, ancestry plays an important role.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, most donors are of Western European descent, which could mean patients from other nationalities and First Nations backgrounds miss out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is important, and to really reflect what the population is in Australia, is that we need donors from all ancestries,\" Stavreski said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important that the stem cells are a match. So in terms of using stem cells from other donors, if it's not a perfect match, well then the transplant just cannot happen.\"\n\n\n\n",

This theme reflects the reality that no single nation, regardless of its size, might, or wealth, can confront the challenges that we face all alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Annalena Baerbock, the former Foreign Minister of Germany who is now the newest President of the United Nations General Assembly, sometimes referred to as UNGA.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld leaders will gather in New York for the Assembly, an event that consists essentially of several days of speeches.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year it's attracting significant attention because multiple leaders have announced their intention to recognise Palestine as a state during the proceedings, like British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With that (two-state) solution now under threat, this is the moment to act. So today as part of this process towards peace, I can confirm the UK will recognise a state of Palestine by the United Nations General Assembly in September unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long-term sustainable peace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is tradition for Brazil to always be the first member state to speak when the General Assembly comes together - because they were the country to step up in the early years of the world body, when other countries were reluctant to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States comes second because it hosts the UN headquarters in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there the list of nations to give speeches is based on hierarchy and generally a first come, first served basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says it's not a time for grandstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some call it the World Cup of Diplomacy, but this cannot be about scoring points, it must be about solving problems. There is too much at stake. We are gathering in turbulent, even uncharted waters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year's General Assembly is significant for another reason.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also the 80th anniversary of the founding of the UN - and that history is key to understanding just what the UNGA is and what its powers are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight tonight, Tuesday the 8th of May. We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing. Today is Victory in Europe Day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced the end of World War Two in Europe in the middle of 1945, and the war in the Pacific was in its dying stages, with the Japanese destined to sign the instrument of surrender at Tokyo Bay in September of that same year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut representatives from 50 countries had already been meeting in San Francisco from April 1945 to draft a new agreement they hoped would avoid more bloodshed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were welcomed by the US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The conference of the United Nations on International Organisation is now convened.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter two months of debate, it was the chairman of the conference - British ambassador to the US Lord Halifax - who ultimately brought the proceedings to an end in June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is now my duty, my honour and my privilege in the Chair to call for a vote on the approval of the charter of the United Nations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsreel organisations like United News captured the moment of that vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And the heads of the 50 United Nations delegations rise to be counted. The vote is unanimous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Charter they approved set out four major parts of the new organisation to be called the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere would be a security council to address military problems, an organisation to solve social issues that might ultimately become the cause of future wars, a court to solve disputes, and a general assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd after starting with 51 members, there are now 193 countries who are part of the Assembly - with the Holy See and Palestine having observer status.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Imogen Saunders is the director of the Centre for International and Public Law at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. So the UN General Assembly is the primary representative organ of the United Nations. Unlike the Security Council, every member of the UN has a seat on the General Assembly. It's the forum in which UN members can get together to discuss issues, but also to issue resolutions in terms of matters that are going on in the world, calling on states to do things, commenting on various matters. It also plays really important roles in various elections to the UN: elections of International Court of Justice judges, elections of Security Council members. And recently it's been playing an increasingly important role in directing advisory opinion requests to the International Court of Justice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Saunders says a major feature of the assembly is that its resolutions are recommendations - not binding directives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat essentially means member states cannot be forced to follow certain courses of action, because the idea is to cooperate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nonetheless, UN General Assembly resolutions do play an important role because the way international law works is - customary international law, which is binding on all states in the world, is formed of state practice and opinio juris, which is what states do, and a belief that law is binding upon them. And General Assembly resolutions can be used as evidence of both state practice and opinio juris. So although they're not binding in and of themselves, if you have enough General Assembly resolutions that build up over a period of time, they can actually contribute to the development of binding norms of international law.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1945, US President Harry Truman believed the United Nations had the potential to avoid a significant amount of bloodshed if it adopted that spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we had had this charter a few years ago, then above all, millions now dead would be alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorian Stephen Schlesinger told the United Nations network earlier this year that the desire for peace has not always been realised through the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They created a charter which reflected the aspirations of humanity... The spirit was very enthusiastic at that time. Of course we now know today that the UN has survived for 80 years through many different crises, ones that sometimes it helped settle, and others it was not able to able to help settle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Dr Saunders says the General Assembly has significant influence through a range of agencies which carry out the UN's mandates - and it also has vast moral authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Absolutely. Because it is the only body where every UN member has a say. And so when you have a resolution that is either unanimous or near unanimous, then that means that you'll essentially have a plebiscite of all the countries in the world and that carries significant moral weight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's that authority the new UNGA President hopes will carry some weight as the 80th Assembly proceeds.\n\n\n\n",

The season we are in now is the right season for us to be doing it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFire, water, native plants - all are central to reviving ecosystems that once thrived here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So they are indicators that the soil, the balance and the health of the soil is returning, because they haven't been here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a vision stretching beyond agriculture \u2014 into healing Country itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Healing country heals people and healing the spirit of the land itself, is the most powerful thing that any human can participate in and contribute back to nature itself, or back to boojar as we say.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOral McGuire was born in Western Australia's Wheatbelt in Beverley, on Ballardong land, and says his family\u2019s connection here goes back thousands of years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of our first trees - this area here was planted out in 2008.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince acquiring Yaraguia farm nearly two decades ago, more than a million trees have been planted.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom bush honey to wattle seed, bush tucker is now thriving again.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr McGuire insists he and his family are not farmers because he is working with Country, not against it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor him, restoring land also means restoring identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it is knowledge being recognised nationally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oral's vision is for the promotion of an entrepreneurial culture within and among the Noongar people of Western Australia. Please welcome Oral McGuire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this year\u2019s Regenerative Food Systems Conference, Yaraguia farm was held up as a model of Indigenous-led restoration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil biodiversity expert Dr Jacob Parnell was at the conference and travelled from the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the global issues that we are facing today, really the foundation of those is the soil. So if we protect the soils and we regenerate, grow those soils then we improve a lot of these other problems we are facing today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Parnell says Indigenous knowledge is critical to the future of farming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Indigenous people were farming for thousands of years and so going back to saying what were they doing that was right, and understanding that interaction with the soil is very important. And so there is that, and then we also have the science to back that up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoongar academic and Impact Dream director Heidi Mippy agrees.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s researching new ways of reimagining landscapes, restoration and food systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's many reasons why we have to have Noongar knowledge at front and centre to these conversations. I think one is around land access, so if we don't have our knowledge brought to the system, we are not reconnecting back to country. And part of that is this reconciliation journey that Australia keeps talking about for the past 20 odd years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says regenerative farmers are more open to First Nations perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My best relationships here at the moment have been with the regenerative farmers. I think this is because they are more open to thinking about things like soil health, biodiversity, water and all of those key issues that it is a little bit harder to have those conversations with mainstream farmers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack on Country, Oral McGuire says this work is about creating a future where his children and the next generation can live on and with the land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The benefit that we have done here as particularly Noongars is, we've put ourselves in a very strong position, where in 10 years\u2019 time we will absolutely exist. And some of our neighbours will be absolutely gone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHealing Country and, in turn, healing people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The healing of country becomes, you know, your own healing. And so I think I've been on a healing, my own healing journey because of this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Ballardong Noongar man Oral McGuire this is not just regenerative farming.\n\n\n\n",

No-one will ever want to date somebody with children,'\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But then I met Chris.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair clicked, and for her next cycle, Lewis put her initial donor on hold and used her new partner Chris Lewis's sperm instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few cycles later, they were trying for a fifth time, a cost that put the pair into debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis says this was going to be their last try, but to her amazement, not one but two of her embryos were successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had twins, baby boys, and they're Chris's biological children,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThey're the jackpot babies.\n\nEight years on, her boys are happy and healthy, and she and Chris are married.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe now 46-year-old holds her journey to motherhood close to her chest, but since a data breach targeted the fertility clinic she used, she's become concerned it could be exploited for malicious purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, Genea Fertility informed clients, including Lewis, via email that personal data had been breached by cybercriminals and posted to the dark web.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO I feel like privacy is dead: IVF data breach triggers interest in class action lawsuit SBS News 07:56 English\n\nThe exposed data includes the medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and prescription medications of those clients, as well as pathology and diagnostic test results.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July, the clinic confirmed it had concluded its investigation and was \"starting to communicate directly with individuals about the findings \u2026 relevant to them\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been hard for Lewis to come to terms with the data breach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is how I built my family. It's so deeply emotional and deeply personal. It's our family story. And to have it on the dark web? How do you even process that?\" she says.\n\n\n\n'Rageful': Personal data on the dark web\n\nGenea has created a page on its website to communicate updates with impacted clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We thank our community for their patience and understanding during our investigation into this cyber incident. We deeply regret that personal information was accessed and published and sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have caused,\" Genea's website reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The protection of our patients, staff and partners' information remains our utmost priority.\"\n\n\n\nIsabel Lewis says the Genea data breach has shaken her confidence in the fertility industry. Credit: Supplied Lewis says the data breach has shaken her confidence in the industry, and some of Genea's other clients appear to feel the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted dozens of people who claim to be victims of the Genea data breach. While a few agreed to speak anonymously, Lewis was happy to talk openly about her experience with the clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer candour and good humour are striking. She recounts everything from the discomfort of invasive procedures to the financial toll of multiple rounds of IVF, each costing around $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fertility treatment is probably the most invasive and emotional medical treatment you can have,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've had treatment for mental health stuff, and I'd probably be less concerned about that being on the dark web.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How a fertility clinic hack turned Isaac\u2019s good deed into a privacy disaster\n\n\"You have an internal ultrasound on the third day of your period, which is not something any woman wants to go through, let alone have a report about it on the dark web,\" Lewis says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if Genea's apologies for the breach go far enough to make amends, her voice takes on a new tone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm rageful, which I laugh about because that's a protection mechanism,\" she says.\n\n\n\nI'm really angry at these for-profit businesses having no consequences.\n\n\"I want new legislation and IT fines that are proportionate to the company's size and financial capacity and the size and impact of the breach,\" Lewis says.\n\n\n\nHundreds interested in class action\n\nLewis has signed on to a class action investigation being conducted by specialist litigation law firm Phi Finney McDonald.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe feels it's too late to reclaim her privacy, so seeking justice through a class action is \"all she can do\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firm's principal lawyer, Tania Noonan, confirmed the group is looking into \"potential redress\" for those impacted by the breach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Patients at Genea are entitled to the highest levels of privacy and safety to ensure their personal details and medical histories remain secure,\" Noonan says.\n\n\n\nSBS News understands hundreds of people have contacted the firm in relation to the Genea data breach, along with Lewis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think change comes from remittance,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not doing it for the money, although money is fine and all, but if there are damages that are significantly painful, hopefully \u2014 and maybe I'm deluded \u2014 the business will change their practices so that they don't have damages like that again.\"\n\n\n\n'Tumultuous' few years for fertility\n\nAustralia's IVF sector has been subject to intense scrutiny following a series of high-profile incidents and systemic failures that have prompted calls for reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Monash IVF disclosed it had transferred the wrong embryo to a patient, two months after a patient was mistakenly implanted with another client's embryo, prompting its CEO to step down.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily creation lawyer Sarah Jefford says it's time to look at how the fertility industry is regulated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fertility industry is in a place where there's a lack of community trust and particularly when we have had a tumultuous few years with fertility,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThings need to change so that we can rebuild that trust for the community.\n\nJefford explains that the fertility industry is essentially self-regulated, with \"patchwork\" laws in each state and territory around assisted reproductive treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They don't really have clear legislation on regulating their day-to-day practices of fertility treatment,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's worked really well up until a point, but I think now we need to look at a different framework to really bring it into line with community expectations about what we expect from the fertility industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe echoes Lewis's sentiment that a financial penalty could lead to a change in how fertility clinics operate.\n\n\n\n\"I know that the fertility industry is worth over $700 million a year. I do think that money talks, so perhaps a financial incentive or penalty could make change in the industry that's otherwise not very well regulated,\" Jefford says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It may not be about getting financial compensation \u2026 but it should set that standard for fertility clinics to know that this is protected information, and they need to be very careful about what they do with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the annual revenue from the fertility and IVF industry exceeds $800 million.\n\n\n\nWhat could a class action over the data breach look like?\n\nDavid Vaile, former chair of the Australian Privacy Foundation, says Australia doesn't have a \"vigorous privacy data protection litigation process\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil recently, the Privacy Act didn't include provisions for Australians to sue to enforce their rights after a privacy breach. But in February, a landmark reform took effect, allowing individuals to pursue civil action for significant breaches of personal privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaile says a class action against Genea could be the first and perhaps soon-to-be-famous test of the new privacy tort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" It may well be that it'll only be through something like a class action that would justify enough legal effort being put into that to actually test [the news laws] out,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, a class action of this kind could compel Genea to pay millions in damages to impacted clients of the data breach, and air allegations in court regarding the company's conduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nClass actions differ from other types of lawsuits, as they involve seven or more persons with claims against the same defendant.\n\n\n\nStream free On Demand Class Actions episode \u2022 Insight \u2022 Current Affairs \u2022 52m episode \u2022 Insight \u2022 Current Affairs \u2022 52m\n\nA class action against Genea could also fall under several types of law, such as consumer, human rights and health law, and its scope would be determined by the law firm working on the case in consultation with the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious consumer law class actions have addressed losses resulting from scams and unfair business practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights class actions have investigated alleged abuses and breaches of human rights, such as an individual's right to privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedical class actions have typically addressed defective operations and treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaile says it will be interesting to see how a legal firm tackles a class action relating to IVF data. He suggests one approach could be to apply equity law to the medical sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Equity isn't about whether you have breached this law or that law, but [asking] 'is your relationship with these people [the patients] so special that you have a special obligation to them?'\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When there's a vulnerable patient who doesn't really have much choice and a very powerful professional \u2014 whether a nurse or doctor in a position of power over them \u2014 that creates what's known as an equitable obligation. So, if there are confidential matters, like medical history, involved, that could be relevant.\"\n\n\n\nData retention\n\nAfter discovering she'd been affected by the data breach, Lewis has been troubled by a niggling question.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy, eight years after the birth of her children, did Genea keep her data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I understand that my medical information and success rate can be useful for the clinic and other women, but why do my name and personal details need to be attached to it? They could have de-identified me,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News put this question to the fertility group, and a Genea spokesperson said maintaining patient records is mandated by law.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Record numbers of malicious data breaches recorded - how do you protect yourself? SBS News 08:39 English\n\n\"The regulations that govern healthcare operations in Australia and other legal requirements mandate that we maintain patient records for certain time frames,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are also additional record retention requirements that depend on variables such as type of treatment, the outcome of the treatment and the state or territory in which the services were provided.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile data retention policies vary state by state, Vaile says groups that retain data have a responsibility to protect it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it can be nearly impossible to totally prevent malicious actors from hacking data, so the best thing to do is to decrease what can be stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way can be through data minimisation, where companies reduce the amount of data they store.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaile says a common school of thought is that data is a \"toxic asset\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The more you have of it, the higher the risk. The longer you hold it, the longer the data retention period; the higher the risk. The more intensively you use it and enable access to it, the higher the risk,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOnce it's held online, it's just a ticking time bomb.\n\nVaile says if a class action found that health workers have a \"special equitable obligation\" to patients, it could make the entire medical profession \"go nuts\", adding that the way Genea stores clients' data could be a key factor in potential future litigation.\n\n\n\nCalls for an IVF watchdog\n\nAdvocates have been calling for reform in the IVF sector and for the establishment of a national regulator or watchdog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's time that we had an Australian Assisted Reproductive Commission that could actually regulate the entire fertility industry, including donor conception and surrogacy,\" Jefford says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Their job could be setting standards for fertility treatments, fertility clinics and licencing and making sure that there is accountability for fertility treatment in Australia, as well as keeping records for donor treatment and surrogacy to make sure that people have access to information about their conception and birth heritage.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Melanie had to reimagine her family when she discovered there were no Indigenous sperm donors\n\nEvie Kendal, a bioethicist and public health scientist at Swinburne University of Technology, says the checks and balances for the IVF industry aren't up to standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we are in a situation where people are having the incorrect embryo transferred, then something has clearly gone wrong,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And because the stakes are so high when it comes to making families, we really can't afford to have any errors, or we need to make sure we have as few as humanly possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only could regulatory reform lead to better health outcomes and data security, but it could also rebuild trust in the IVF sector, Kendal says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are seeing mistakes and human errors that are actually having massive ramifications for families. An independent watchdog or a federal regulatory body would actually bring back a lot of trust with the community,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that we have inconsistent state legislation when it comes to assisted reproduction and the fact that the rules are different depending on where you are in the country really does undermine that public trust.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO When a good deed becomes a privacy disaster: a sperm donor speaks out SBS News 08:01 English\n\nA federal watchdog could also regulate how much profit an IVF clinic is allowed to make for its services, Kendal says.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, federal Health Minister Mark Butler announced the establishment of an independent accreditation system for fertility providers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccreditation for services will be provided by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and will be in place by January 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe body would develop nationwide guidelines, performance monitoring metrics, workforce and staffing guidance and clearer complaint pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the government has not committed to legal reform or national laws regulating the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis is hopeful the class action could lead to changes in the \"lucrative\" IVF space and make it a better and more secure process for Australians wanting to start a family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For some people wanting to have kids, the level of desperation and the money that has gone into it is staggering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There needs to be something in place to protect people, and there have to be some serious consequences for commercial organisations not taking that responsibility seriously.\"\n\n\n\n",

The violins, under concertmaster Andrew Haveron introduced more urgent animation and captured a point of vertiginous intensity at the climactic point of the phrase, as though arriving at a breathtaking panorama.\n\nDonald Runnicles and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra gave a glowing performance of Sibelius\u2019s Symphony No. 2, shaping its abundant melodic riches with warmth and an astute understanding of the way its lapidary structure unfolds.

The portentous bassoon solo (Matthew Wilkie) emerged over the top of an almost inaudible plucked tread from cellos and basses as though a thought had suddenly crystallised. But perhaps the symphony\u2019s most beautiful moment was the oboe theme (Shefali Pryor) ushered into the middle section of the third movement, which, up to this point had bristled with scurrying energy from the strings.\n\nThis melody is of such disarmingly simple beauty, one scarcely notices that it is built on themes of the first movement, including the symphony\u2019s opening notes. This is perhaps the kind of integration Sibelius was referring to when he later remarked to Gustav Mahler that what he liked about symphonic works was the profound logic that created an inner connection between its motives (Mahler famously answered, \u201cNo, the symphony must be like the world\u201d).\n\nFor the finale, Sibelius conceived two imposing but contrasting ideas, the first of surging exaltation, the second of implacable sternness and quiet resolve that grows to become overwhelming. Runnicles guided both so that the expressiveness was exhilarating, but never over-inflated.\n\nThe danger of arriving at the closing passages with the feeling that all the fireworks have already been let off, which is sometimes a problem with this work in less experienced hands, was avoided here and the performance closed in radiant magnificence.\n\nBefore this, Runnicles and the SSO articulated the tempestuous outer textures and tender contrasting cor anglais melody (Alexandre Oguey) of Wagner\u2019s Overture to the Flying Dutchman with musicianly care, moulding brass chords carefully so the turbulence was incisive but not allowed to unbalance the texture or run amok. The program is repeated on Friday and Saturday with the added bonus of mezzo-soprano Sasha Cook in Elgar\u2019s Sea Pictures.",

    "text": "However, KKR group boss Mysore explained in an exclusive interview with this masthead that he and other potential investors would want an exclusive window for all players to appear in the entire BBL tournament, plus the right to rename and rebrand teams to give them higher visibility in India. Loading He said any overlap between Test cricket and the T20 league would be a red line for many potential investors. This would leave Cricket Australia with a huge challenge around how to structure the summer while preserving the things that matter to Australian cricket fans; the Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Tests. Mysore said it was unlikely that Indian investors with IPL teams in their stables would be content to buy into the BBL as passive participants. They would want a say in the name and branding of the teams, player availability, match timeslots and calendar windows.\n\n\u201cSustained interest in the league will depend on the availability of all local and foreign players,\u201d Mysore said. \u201cThe two key components are a dedicated window, without any clashes with other leagues, and full availability of local players.\u201d However, there is a contrast between investors, like KKR group or Mumbai Indians group \u2013 owned by the multi-billionaire Ambani family \u2013 and so-called \u201ctech titans\u201d based in the United States. A group of these tech moguls recently paid $300 million for a 49 per cent stake in the London Spirit franchise based at Lord\u2019s. Some investors may be content simply to buy in because of the prestige. But already, the Hundred has been criticised by new franchise owners because the ECB rested some Test players from the early rounds following their exhausting drawn Test series against India.\n\nAt the same time, franchises are in the process of being renamed. BBL clubs, such as the Melbourne Stars and Sydney Sixers, have been described as \u201ctrophy assets\u201d that investors will want to buy into simply to be associated with legendary venues, such as the MCG, SCG or Adelaide Oval. The continued appeal of the BBL was on show at Ninja Stadium in January when Mitch Owen powered the Hobart Hurricanes to victory over Sydney Thunder to claim the title. Credit: Getty Images But Mysore says investors expecting a return will be looking for ways to be actively involved. That is certainly the case for KKR, who would want to have a team named Melbourne or Sydney Knight Riders, branded in the group\u2019s purple and gold colours, and involving players like Sunil Narine, who already have year-round deals with KKR.\n\n\u201cKnight Riders were the first to conceive of and execute on a global brand strategy,\u201d Mysore said. \u201cIt has become a genuine global brand that has also globalised our fan base.\u201d CA says the Big Bash League is in good health, though still down on its peak season in 2016, when more than 80,000 people turned up for a Stars-Renegades derby at the MCG. AT the peak of its popularity, the BBL drew 80,000 fans to the MCG for a Melbourne derby in January 2016. Credit: Daniel Pockett - CA/Cricket Australia via Getty Images In those days, the BBL was seen as the world\u2019s second-best T20 league behind the IPL, but since then, the franchise market has exploded. There are now major leagues in South Africa and the UAE competing for players at the same time as the BBL, in addition to those in India, the West Indies, England and the United States.\n\nThis growth has provided unprecedented opportunities for players to make millions, and demonstrated how much private capital is potentially available to cricket in Australia, should CA and the states finally decide to take the plunge. CA says the windfall would help supercharge the Big Bash, including a handsome increase to the salary cap to keep the best players from absconding to other leagues, and flow through to the grassroots. \u201cMy experience with privately owned teams is, if done right, it\u2019s a really good thing for the sport,\u201d said Australian Test captain Pat Cummins, who was purchased by Sunrisers Hyderabad at the 2024 IPL auction $3.7 million. \u201cYou look at an IPL team that\u2019s privately funded, and the amount they put into the team and programs, they do their own development camps and their own talent pathway and academies.\n\n\u201cOur IPL team we have a social media team of about 30 people who travel around, so there\u2019s things that can get unlocked that make the experience better for fans. Then the big question is how do you use those funds to make sure that cricket\u2019s in a really good spot and supporting community cricket as well as professional cricket.\u201d But these leagues are not without their problems. The SAT20 is the third attempt by Cricket South Africa to grow a healthy franchise competition, jointly owned by pay TV service Supersport and a conglomerate of Indian investors. South Africa\u2019s wider economic struggles, particularly in terms of the value of the Rand, is costing millions for team owners each year. Mysore was not shy in saying that there is something of a bubble about the growth of franchise leagues, up to and including the lofty sums paid for teams in the Hundred. \u201cThe financial viability in the medium to long term is a very important component,\u201d Mysore said. \u201cIn the event that leagues are not financially viable, the future of those leagues will be questioned.\u201d\n\nThe BBL is an attractive proposition for investors, given its history of relative financial success and the fact it is underpinned by Cricket Australia\u2019s place as one of the \u201cbig three\u201d nations alongside India and England. But much of the BBL\u2019s strength has derived from taking a very different approach to the franchise model. The tournament co-exists with Test cricket, especially around Boxing Day and New Year, and does not rely on the presence of Cummins, Travis Head or Mitchell Starc playing its full duration. Mysore with established Knight Riders player Sunil Narine. Credit: NurPhoto via Getty Images In turn, that has allowed the Australian Test team to perform at a consistently high level with minimal disruption from the T20 circuit. It\u2019s a dynamic that relies upon a shared sense of purpose between Cricket Australia and the states, who control the BBL teams. CA\u2019s chief executive Todd Greenberg and chair Mike Baird have met with their state association counterparts over the past two weeks in attempts to thrash out details of a potential sale, but are yet to reach consensus. The states hold 30-year licences to the clubs, with a 15-year review clause that comes into effect next year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re considering,\u201d Baird told this masthead. \u201cIf you did consider private investment, what are the key criteria we would keep. \u201cTo individual teams and owners and what they might want, any sort of criteria, that is for us to consider and set the criteria. If we want to make the decision to consider private investment, it would be done on our terms, and done collectively. \u201cThe risks and challenges we\u2019ve seen across the world. The beauty is we can take the best of that and put in the terms and conditions that are important to Australian cricket.\u201d Mysore has fond memories of watching Test matches in his hometown of Chennai every January, and respects the traditions of Boxing Day and New Year Tests in Australia.\n\nBut that respect will not stop Mysore and others from asking questions before they decide whether to buy a franchise. In the UK, team owners have pushed for the separate sale of broadcast rights for the Hundred, away from international cricket, so that the value of the tournament is more clearly known. While the big broadcast numbers attracted by the Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Tests are widely thought to aid the audiences for BBL games in the evenings, franchise owners will want to know which is helping which. Baird has stressed that CA and the states must retain control of whatever privatisation model is ultimately agreed. A decision is expected before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we\u2019d want to control the schedule,\u201d Baird said. \u201cSo that Test cricket remains an essential part of the Australian summer.\u201d Cummins said other nations would love to have the commercially successful Test series seen here. \u201cIt is a different model to a lot of other countries, but I think it\u2019s a better model,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wish they could have five Test matches sold out and everyone watched as well as the BBL. \u201cIt\u2019s great we\u2019ve got two tournaments that can run concurrently and there\u2019s a place for both of them.\u201d The global strategy becomes still more attractive if Indian players are available to play outside the IPL. So far, the BCCI has rebuffed inquiries by franchise owners about allowing more freedom of movement, but the recent decision of champion off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin to quit the IPL and go \u201cglobal\u201d, potentially to the BBL this summer, shows that the mood is gradually shifting.\n\nMysore declined to comment on whether Indian players would be more freely available to play in overseas leagues in the future, but Baird said this week he was in constant discussions about the matter with Indian authorities. Loading The BBL was effectively bankrolled in its first two years by CA\u2019s slice of the cash from the short-lived T20 Champions League. But in 2013 CA signed a deal with Ten for the tournament for about $100 million over five years. That figure grew again as part of a $1.18 billion overall deal with Foxtel and Seven in 2018, before the current $1.5 billion agreement was signed in 2023. Franchise owners will want a percentage of the broadcast rights value from any future deals. In the meantime, plenty have conveyed their interest to Cummins, over numerous seasons of the IPL. \u201cThree or four of the IPL owners have been like, \u2018oh we\u2019d love to get involved\u2019,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cA lot of Indian fans, they\u2019ve grown up watching Australian cricket teams, and they hold Australian cricket in such high regard that the BBL is, in their eyes, a really attractive league they want to be a part of, and they want to be linked to Australian cricket.\u201d",

    "text": "Australia faces pressure to back its controversial climate target with action as the minister in charge bats away questions over a new renewable energy goal.\n\nLabor unveiled its 2035 climate target to criticism from environmental groups and the business sector as it revealed Australia would aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 62 and 70 per cent compared to 2005 levels.\n\nThe goal aligns with advice from the Climate Change Authority.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut when asked if Australia would follow it up with other mechanisms that would help reach the target, such as a 90 per cent renewable energy goal by 2035, Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen did not offer a firm commitment.\n\nAustralia hasn't locked in a 2035 target for transitioning to renewable energy, the minister says. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"We haven't set a particular (2035 renewables) target,\" he told ABC's Insiders on Sunday.\n\n\"What we have done is set our emissions reduction target and then we'll continue to deliver.\"\n\nAustralia is working towards a target of 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030, but the Australian Energy Market Operator has predicted 90 per cent of the grid would need to be powered by renewables by 2035 to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMr Bowen has backed his government's emissions reduction goal, but assured his government would continue to take other steps.\n\n\"This is very ambitious, it's doable, it's achievable,\" he said.\n\n\"We're making good progress, but I'm not putting my feet on the desk saying that's done.\"\n\nMembers of the Nationals remain opposed to the emissions reduction goals as turmoil over the net-zero target threatens to tear the coalition apart once again.\n\nOutspoken Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has claimed it would have a \"devastating\" impact on the economy and played down its impact on climate change.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"They always come up with these Calamity Jane statements,\" he told Sky News on Sunday.\n\n\"I think Australians are over net-zero.\"\n\nNationals MP Barnaby Joyce claims the net-zero target would 'devastate' Australia's economy. (Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nBut Climate Change Authority Chair Matt Kean, whose opinion aligns with the vast majority of climate experts, maintained action must be taken urgently.\n\n\"The more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more heat that we're creating, and the more extreme weather events that will result from that,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"It is having a catastrophic impact, not only on Australia, but globally.\n\n\"We need to be part of a global effort to reduce the amount of carbon that we put into the atmosphere - to stop or limit global warming - so that we can protect our lives and our livelihoods.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMany environment groups have warned the current 2035 target does not go far enough.\n\nThe emissions targets landed days after a diabolical report on Australia's expected climate impacts, including a warning that 1.5 million people could be exposed to coastal hazards from rising seas by 2050.",
