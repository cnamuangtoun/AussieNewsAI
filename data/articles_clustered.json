I think I'll need probably China approval, and I think President Xi will probably do it,\" the president said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.\"\n\nAsked who the buyer is going to be, Trump said, \"I'll tell you in about two weeks.\"\n\n\"It's a group of very wealthy people,\" the president added.\n\nDonald Trump says a buyer for TikTok may be finalised soon. (iStock)\n\nIt's been about five months since a law requiring TikTok to be banned in the United States unless it was sold off by its China-based parent company, ByteDance, technically went into effect.\n\nBut thanks to President Donald Trump's promises not to enforce the law, neither of those things have happened, aside from an approximately 14-hour blackout in January.\n\nTrump has instead signed three orders delaying enforcement on the ban.\n\nAs a June 19 deadline to enforce the sale-or-ban law approached earlier this month, Trump granted TikTok a 90-day extension. The deadline for its parent company ByteDance to hand over control of TikTok's US operations is now September 17.\n\nThe delay raised questions about the status of a deal that could secure TikTok's long-term future in the US. The Chinese government has offered little public indication that it would be willing to approve a sale beyond suggesting that any deal could not include TikTok's \"algorithm,\" which has been called the app's secret sauce.\n\nREAD MORE: Teenager bitten by shark at popular holiday beach in NSW\n\n\"It's a group of very wealthy people,\" the president teased about the buyer. (AP)\n\nIn April, a deal that would have transferred majority control of TikTok's US operations to American ownership was nearly finalised.\n\nBut it fell apart after Trump announced additional tariffs on China, forcing the president to announce another 75-day delay to keep the app operational in the United States.\n\n\"There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" TikTok parent company ByteDance said after Trump's tariff policy stalled progress on the deal in April.",

    "text": "Wendy Whiteley's best memories of her former husband, Archibald Prize winner Brett Whiteley, were the days he was making her laugh or as she was watching him work.\n\nIt was a long marriage with good and bad memories, she said.\n\nTheir life, with its turbulence and tenderness, is captured in a touring exhibition from the Brett Whiteley studio in New South Wales.\n\nThe Shepparton Art Museum is the final leg and only Victorian gallery to host the Inside The Studio exhibition, which includes drawings, ceramics, sketchbooks, photographs, Whiteley's famous painting of Sydney Harbour and his 1976 Archibald Prize-winning self-portrait.\n\nWhiteley is known not only for his celebrated art, but also for his friendships with famous musicians and a rocky personal life marked by drug addiction that led to his death in 1992.\n\nBrett Whiteley in his Surry Hills studio in Sydney, 1990. (Supplied: Andrew Fisher)\n\nMs Whiteley remembers he was happiest when he was working and took up large chunks of the family's living space for his craft.\n\n\"[He had a] pretty speedy, fairly manic personality, so when he wasn't working he was a very different person,\" she said.\n\nAt their shared London studio, Ms Whiteley, who is also an artist, remembers having to draw a chalk line on the floor and say \"don't cross over with the paint\".\n\n\"But he always did.\"\n\nWhiteley's Self Portrait at 36, Comedown. (ABC Shepparton: Charmaine Manuel)\n\nSome of her favourite works in the exhibition are sketches of her in the bathtub, inspired by French artist Pierre Bonnard who drew his own wife Martha in the bath.\n\nShe's had to buy many of them back as they proved to be incredibly popular with collectors.\n\nWhiteley's sketchbooks on display at the Shepparton Art Museum. (ABC Shepparton: Charmaine Manuel)\n\n\"As people have died off in England or Scotland, they've come back to be auctioned here and I've been able to buy some back.\n\n\"It's been really, really meaningful to me, very emotional, and I'm really happy to have them back again.\"\n\n'A servant of art'\n\nAccording to Whiteley's biographer, Ashleigh Wilson, he may have had a \"rock'n'roll lifestyle\", but he was \"above all an extraordinarily serious and dedicated artist\".\n\n\"The most striking aspects of his life and work was how rounded and full of an artist he was,\" Mr Wilson said.\n\nBiographer Ashleigh Wilson with Wendy Whiteley. (Supplied: Ashleigh Wilson)\n\n\"He was an extraordinarily dedicated thinker and practitioner of art.\n\n\"He was a student of art, he was a servant of art.\"\n\n\" But the reason that we keep coming back to him, the reason why his name still endures, is the power of his creativity. \"\n\nWhiteley spent years living in London, New York, Fiji and Italy, but by the mid 1970s he was living on the lower North Shore of Sydney.\n\nFrom his balcony in Lavender Bay, he created his best known works including his depiction of Sydney Harbour and his prize-winning self-portrait.\n\nWhiteley's depiction of Sydney Harbour from the view of his balcony in Lavender Bay. (Supplied: Shepparton Art Museum)\n\nThe face of addiction\n\nWhiteley's piece for the 1976 Archibald Prize used his iconic shade of ultramarine blue \u2014 one that he said had an \"ecstasy-like effect on his nervous system\", Mr Wilson said.\n\nHe added that if you spent time in Lavender Bay and looked out from Whiteley's window onto the harbour, \"the blue in front of you is one that has made its way into his paintings and almost become a colour that he's claimed for himself\".\n\nBrett Whiteley's 1976 Archibald Prize-winning self-portrait.

(ABC Shepparton: Callum Marshall)\n\nFor his ex-wife, the portrait shows a \"warning\".\n\n\"It's a kind of warning picture too, the face in that, about the drug addiction,\" she said.\n\nMusic an important ingredient\n\nExhibition curator Nick Yelverton says what makes this exhibition unique is the musical component, with viewers able to download a playlist drawn from Whiteley's record collection.\n\n\"We've tried to replicate the rock'n'roll atmosphere of the studio in Surry Hills,\" Mr Yelverton said.\n\n\"The music informed the creation of these works, so it's actually quite complementary.\"\n\nNick Yelverton says Whiteley's musical influences are a key component of the exhibition. (ABC Shepparton: Charmaine Manuel)\n\nWhiteley rubbed shoulders with artists like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin (who once babysat his daughter) and was close friends with members of Dire Straits.\n\nTheir live record Alchemy is named after one of Whiteley's paintings, which forms the cover for the record.\n\n\"Music was really central to his life and I think it's not an exaggeration, and certainly he said, that if it wasn't for art he would have loved to have gone into music,\" Mr Wilson said.",

    "text": "A not-for-profit environmental group is calling for more clarity and enforcement after releasing drone footage of land in central Queensland it says may have been illegally cleared under federal law.\n\nThe Wilderness Society said it was alerted to instances of land clearing by users of its app, which it then documented with legally obtained drone footage filmed over 12 months.\n\nQueensland campaigns manger Hannah Schuch said the clearing was primarily for beef production at properties in the Marlborough and Emerald regions.\n\n\"[The] freshly bulldozed native forests and bushland are likely to be home of dozens of threatened species, including the koala, the greater glider and the red goshawk,\" she said.\n\nHannah Schuch says the EPBC laws need to be clearer. (Supplied: The Wilderness Society)\n\nBut the state's peak body for agriculture labelled the claims misleading and said no-one had done anything illegal.\n\n\"We're very conscious of our environmental credentials and of what we are allowed to clear and not allowed to clear,\" AgForce Queensland president Shane McCarthy said.\n\nThe Wilderness Society said the clearing of hundreds of hectares of land was legal at the state level but had been done without the mandatory assessment by the federal government.\n\nThe Wildnerness Society compiled the images over 12 months. (Supplied: The Wilderness Society)\n\nAny act that has a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance, such as clearing the habitat of a threatened species, requires a referral under the federal government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC).\n\nThe society's claims follow allegations made by the Australian Conservation Foundation that 90,000 hectares of land across the nation had been illegally cleared for beef production.\n\nThe National Farmers' Federation has rejected that claim.\n\nA spokesperson for the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said an investigation into the Marlborough matter had been closed with no enforcement action taken.\n\nIt said the matters in Emerald remained under investigation.\n\nThe Wilderness Society says the land was cleared primarily for beef production. (Supplied: The Wilderness Society)\n\n'A lot of confusion'\n\nMr McCarthy said much of the clearing on beef properties was conducted to manage regrowth on previously cleared land.\n\nShane McCarthy says the claims are misleading. (ABC Landline)\n\nHe said there was a lack of clarity in the EPBC Act.\n\n\"We know of cases where people have got these notices in the mail to say 'there could be an endangered habitat, but we don't know where it is', and when the producers go down and actually look at the area \u2026 there's no chance of that being there,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\n\"There's a lot of confusion.\"\n\nHe said landowners were conscious of animals on their land and would never knowingly clear a threatened species habitat.\n\n\"Producers are the better stewards of that land \u2026 they live there, they manage it on a day-to-day basis,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\n\"They don't sit in an office down in Sydney or Melbourne somewhere and look at it on a map and then decide what should or shouldn't be done there.\n\n\" These guys live and breathe that piece of country. \"\n\nCalls for overhaul\n\nThe Wilderness Society has called on the government to make sure the laws are understood properly and enforced.\n\n\"It really shouldn't be up to citizen scientists and not-for-profit independent organisations to monitor what's happening on the ground,\" Ms Schuch said.\n\nThe environment department said anyone found in breach of the EPBC Act could be fined, directed to remediate damage or face prison time.\n\nThe Wilderness Society said it was alerted to the clearing by contributors to its app. (Supplied: The Wilderness Society)\n\n\"The department routinely monitors and verifies compliance across our regulatory schemes and works to detect, disrupt and deter noncompliant activity,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe federal government has been working on reforming the act for several years.\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Wyatt has admitted the laws are \"broken\" and held a roundtable meeting this month to discuss reform.\n\nNo change is expected before Christmas, but the minister is adamant there will be reform in the next 18 months.",

(Supplied)\n\nMr and Mrs Finger had been married for 47 years and together have three sons and a daughter and 12 grandchildren.\n\nNot one for the spotlight, Mrs Finger was happy to leave the television fame to her husband but was a quiet, unwavering support for him.\n\nSharing the news, Mr Finger paid tribute to his wife.\n\n\"A life so beautifully lived deserves to be beautifully remembered,\" he said.\n\nHe said he believed somehow Annie knew his wife was gone.\n\nFrank Finger with his dogs Lucifer and Annie.

(ABC/Muster Dogs)\n\n\"I knew if I called her that I would have a bond just the same as I had with my mother,\" Mr Finger said.\n\n\"You can be the best trainer in the world but unless you care for that particular animal and have that bond you won't get what we had.\"\n\nMr Finger said choosing a meaningful name was a bonding secret and it needed to be something that was special to you, creating a special tone in your voice for the dog to pick up.\n\nAnnie was named after Mr Finger's late mother. (ABC/Muster Dogs)\n\nThroughout the show, Annie gained the nickname of \"princess\" and Mr Finger would often refer to her as a \"lovely dog\" in filming.\n\nAfter winning the television show, the pair went on to become celebrities, travelling across the nation to compete in muster dog trials and appear as guest stars in agricultural shows and events.\n\nMr Finger with muster dogs Lucky, Lucifer and Annie last year.

refund may be rubbing their hands together with glee.\n\nWhatever the motivation, many of us just want to get it over and done with.\n\nHere's what you need to know before you start.\n\nWhen does a new financial year start?\n\nEach new financial year starts on July 1 \u2014 which is tomorrow.\n\nIt'll be the 2025-26 financial year.\n\nWhen can I lodge my tax return?\n\nTechnically, you can lodge your tax return for the 2024-25 financial year from tomorrow.\n\nBut experts reckon it's best not to rush into it.\n\n\"Wait until the end of July,\" Australian Taxation Office (ATO) assistant commissioner Rob Thomson says.\n\nWhy should I wait to lodge my tax return?\n\n\"We'll have pre-filled a lot of the information in for you, [which] makes it easier to get it right the first time,\" Mr Thomson says.\n\nThis might include your earnings for the last financial year from your employment and interest you've earned from your bank account.\n\nWhen is my tax return due?\n\nThat depends on whether you're doing it yourself or if you're going through an accountant.\n\nIf you're lodging your tax return yourself, it's due October 31.\n\nBut if you're going through an accountant, you may get more time.\n\n\"You need to make sure that you are on their books by October 31,\" an ATO spokesperson said.\n\n\"You should contact your tax agent to discuss by when you will need to lodge your return.\"\n\nHow do I find my tax file number?\n\nIf you've already got a tax file number, you can find it in the federal government's myGov app if you've linked your account to the ATO.\n\nTap the \"Services\" icon on the bottom right-hand corner and click the \"Australian Taxation Office\" link.\n\nThe next screen that pops up should have a \"Find my TFN\" icon to press.\n\nYou can find your tax file number using the myGov app. (ABC News: Dannielle Maguire)\n\nBut you can also find it on your tax returns from previous years, your pay slips or an account statement from your super fund.\n\nWhat if I need help but can't afford an accountant?\n\nIf you earned less than $70,000, you may be eligible for a free service called Tax Help.\n\nThe program matches people up with accredited volunteers who help them lodge their tax returns online.\n\nYou can find out more about this free service on the ATO's website.\n\nWhat happens if I make a mistake on my tax return?\n\nYou can fix it after lodging.\n\n\"If you forgot to report any income, capital gains or deductions, don't worry,\" the ATO said on social media.\n\n\"You generally have up to two years to amend your tax return.\"\n\nHow much will I get back?\n\nThat depends on your personal circumstances.\n\nYou only get money from the ATO if you've paid more tax than you should have throughout the year.\n\nThis money is called a tax refund.\n\nBut if you've paid the right amount of tax, you won't get any money back from the ATO.\n\nAnd it's possible that your tax assessment will say you actually need to pay the ATO money and you'll end up with a tax bill.\n\nIf that's the case, there are options available to you if you can't afford to pay your bill off in one go \u2014 this ATO website lists the ways you can get help coping with a bill.\n\nWhen will I get my refund back?\n\nThat depends on how you lodge your tax return.\n\nHere's how long the ATO says it generally takes to process tax returns:\n\nLodged online: Two weeks\n\nTwo weeks Lodged by paper: 10 weeks from when the ATO receives the forms\n\n10 weeks from when the ATO receives the forms Lodged by a tax agent: Two weeks\n\nOnce the ATO processes your return, you'll get what's called a notice of assessment.\n\nIf you're entitled to a refund and you have provided the ATO with your bank details, that money will be transferred to your bank account.\n\n\"We usually see payment processing times of around three business days from when we issue the notice of assessment,\" an ATO spokesperson said.\n\n\"This timing is dependent on your bank and how long they take to process that into your account.\"\n\nBut if you've gone via an agent and didn't pay an up-front fee, it might take longer.\n\nThat's because some agents will instruct the ATO to pay the refund into their account, when they'll deduct their fee and then pass on the rest of the money to you.\n\nIf you haven't given the ATO your bank details and are expecting your refund via cheque, you'll probably be affected by the new rules that came into effect in January.\n\nThose rules state that the ATO can hold on to your refund for up to 90 days while they contact you, asking for your bank details.\n\nIf you give them your bank details \u2014 or your accountant's \u2014 the ATO will transfer your refund into that account.\n\nOtherwise, if you don't give the ATO your bank details within those 90 days, you'll eventually be sent a cheque.\n\nThe federal government is phasing out the use of cheques. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\nCan I still get my refund via cheque?\n\nYes.\n\nBut it could take much, much longer this year because of the new 90-day rule we talked about above.\n\nThis is part of the federal government's plan to phase out cheques.\n\nThe ATO will stop issuing refunds via cheque in 2028.\n\nIts preferred method of paying out refunds is via what's called an electronic funds transfer (EFT) \u2014 which means putting the money directly into your bank account.\n\n\"EFT payments are faster and more secure than cheques,\" the ATO's website says.\n\nBut, in order to do this, the ATO needs your bank details so it can specify which account to put that money into.\n\n\"We'll only use these account details to deposit refunds and ATO-held super,\" the ATO says.\n\n\"We don't use them for direct debits.\"",

But what about on your worst day when your arthritis in your shoulder is just causing you that much pain that you can't even lift your arm above your shoulder?\"\n\nThe Care Squeeze forum panel of Briony Underwood from Elder Rights Australia, former Commissioner for Senior Victorians Gerard Mansour and Rachel Lanethe, principal of financial advice firm Aged Care Gurus (ABC)\n\nFormer Commissioner for Senior Victorians Gerard Mansour encourages family members to spend a couple of hours preparing for assessments and think of real-life examples.\n\n\"A real life experience was recently someone saying, yeah, mum, but do you remember when you put the steel bowl in the microwave and blew it up?,\" he said.",

    "text": "There are calls for the government to tighten Telstra's obligation to its customers to include \"timely and to standard\" upgrades of its mobile services after towns were left disconnected for a fortnight.\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud said the government needed to make changes to the Universal Service Obligation (USO).\n\nUnder the USO, Telstra has an obligation to provide a \"standard telephone service\" within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n\"The USO was put in place when Telstra was privatised, over landlines and payphones because that's the only technology we had,\" Mr Littleproud said.\n\n\"Subsequent to that, we've seen technology shift \u2026 mobiles have now taken over.\n\n\"What we said in the last election is what the Coalition would do \u2026 extending that USO to cover the mobile phone infrastructure.\"\n\nDavid Littleproud says regional Australia was left without much of the services that people living in a city would expect. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nMore than 13,000 residents in Dalby, on Queensland's Western Downs, had mobile calls, internet and other services including EFTPOS and ATMs disrupted for two weeks this month due to Telstra upgrading a tower.\n\nTelstra told the ABC that customers needed to have a backup option available.\n\n\"This is when it's really important to have that second type of connection \u2026 such as NBN, satellite, or landline,\" regional general manager Ms Boisen said.\n\n\"We understand people are using the mobile network, that's why we're doing this massive upgrade on the tower in Dalby.\"\n\nMr Littleproud said the response was \"substandard\".\n\n\"We've seen this elsewhere \u2026 in St George, and in Goondiwindi, we had outages going well beyond days. That's why the government needs to step in,\" he said.\n\nThe upgrades are needed as demand on the network has grown by 30 per cent year-on-year, according to Telstra. (Four Corners)\n\nA spokesperson from the office of Communications Minister Anika Wells told the ABC the government was looking to include mobile coverage in its legislation.\n\n\"Through Universal Outdoor Mobile Obligation (UOMO), the government is putting mobile coverage right at the core of the Universal Services Obligation,\" they said.\n\n\"While the Coalition left USO reform to languish, Labor has taken real steps to ensure regional communities aren't forgotten when it comes to mobile coverage.\"\n\nWhen the ABC asked for additional information, the government sent a statement released in February by then-communications minister Michelle Rowland.\n\nIt stated the government would consult and introduce legislation this year to cover the mobile network.\n\n\"Implementation of outdoor SMS and voice will be expected by late 2027, with many Australians likely to obtain access before then,\" the release said.\n\n\"Basic mobile data will be considered in the future as technology road maps and capacity considerations develop.\"\n\nLocals left rattled\n\nTelstra switched off Dalby's mobile services on Monday, June 16 in order to upgrade its base tower to 5G.\n\nNBN, satellite, and landline connections were uninterrupted , but locals called it a safety issue, with many businesses and medical staff impacted in the town of about 13,000 people.\n\nMr Littleproud, also the member for Maranoa, said the regional town had been forgotten.\n\n\"If it was happening in Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane, Telstra would have fixed this by now. But because it's in Dalby, they don't care,\" he said.\n\nMobile services in Dalby and surrounds were restored after the two-week disruption, but the outage left businesses and residents shaken.\n\n\"It's a bit of a catch here \u2014 we have to rely on Telstra as once you leave town most other providers aren't available,\" Anna Story from Dalby's Chamber of Commerce said.\n\n\"They need to change their advice for future outages.\n\n\"[Saying] 'coverage is likely to be impacted' is a very different thing to no coverage for five days.\"\n\nIt was stressful for residents too.\n\n\"My elderly father-in-law has been in hospital for several weeks in the Scenic Rim and my husband \u2014 his power of attorney \u2014 has been uncontactable in the case that urgent medical and care decisions need to be made,\" Tina Burnett said.\n\n\"My husband works out of town, and he was unable to contact his employer or the other works to coordinate tasks as they had no service on their mobile phones.\"\n\nLocated four hours west of Brisbane, Dalby is an agricultural and industrial hub in the Western Downs. (Supplied: Southern Queensland Country Tourism)\n\nMs Burnett said the outage was poorly communicated.\n\n\"They provided a link to outage details which required me entering my address. When I did that, the website told me that there was no outage in my area,\" she said.",

A 91st-minute goal earns Slovenia a 1-1 draw with the Matildas in Perth, denying Joe Montemurro two wins from as many matches as Australia coach.\n\n\"I love playing in the midfield, I was really excited to have the opportunity to play there,\" Kennedy told Paramount Plus.\n\n\"Hopefully, the first of many and I think it was a good start.\"\n\nKennedy was a midfielder as a junior and has been deployed there at a club level since making a move from Manchester City to NWSL side Angel City in January.\n\n\"I'm happy to play for Australia in any position, even if it means in goal,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"But I'm not going to complain about playing in the midfield.\n\n\"I love being a defender, but I think for me, like my heart's a bit higher up the pitch and I'm happy to have the opportunity to play there.\"\n\nBeing able to use Kennedy in the midfield would give Montemurro another option heading into next year's Asian Cup, which will be staged in Australia.\n\n\"When you've got a player like Alanna who protects the back two, the fullbacks can come inside and have more freedom,\" Montemurro said.\n\n\"The wingers have more freedom to come inside into midfield and create overloads.\n\n\"When you've got that stability of one player, you can create the overloads.\"\n\nKennedy is one of eight players set to depart the Matildas set-up following the fixtures against Slovenia.\n\nAnother eight are jetting to Western Australia for friendlies against Panama on July 5 and 8.\n\nAAP",

So it is about increasing the minimum wage and increase in super but there's also increases in payments that come from the government. There's increase in PPL, and we're paying super on PPL.

I tell them the story how our ancestors walked around this area to look for bush tuckers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYellow Water and the surrounding floodplain is the heart of Kakadu and is an important food source for those living on Country, including up to a million Magpie geese, a bird that is special to Traditional Owners.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Iskov is a chef from Western Australia who is cooking at the Taste of Kakadu.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis role involves not just preparing traditional cuisine, but understanding the origin of each ingredient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really nice to hear those stories about ingredients that connect country up here. The water lily\u2019s are down where you catch the barramundi and this cheeky yam is pretty much on the side of the bank as well, so all those ingredients tie together.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul is known among chefs as Yoda and has travelled to Kakadu many times to develop culinary dishes - and the Kakadu plum is one that has captured global attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland researchers in September last year, found the fruit has antioxidant properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific research, now reinforcing traditional knowledge that has been known for thousands of years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it is knowledge like this that has enriched the experience of visitors, experiencing the First Nations event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There definitely needs to be more stuff like this, if this was more frequent, you'd definitely get more people looking into it.\"\n\n\n\n",

That's why I introduced laws last year to have a different pathway. A pathway to say 'well if preventative detention is hard, I certainly don't want people who've had their visas cancelled to be in the community at all.

Source: SBS News With plans for renovations, Xu needed to get beneath his house, much of which is raised, sitting above a carport.\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering the undercroft of his new home via a small door, Xu was shocked to find the area, which is just tall enough to stand in, entirely taken up by the elaborate setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To do the renovation, I would have to go downstairs to have a look and do some inspections and when I got down I saw this massive incredible train model just sitting there,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was shocked and I immediately asked my wife to come down to have a look \u2014 she was shocked.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's unbelievable, so massive, so huge.\"\n\n\n\nThe model train set was put together by the former owner of the house Daniel Xu recently purchased and could be about 60 years old. Source: SBS News He said nothing had been mentioned about model trains during the open home inspections.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoincidentally, Xu is a train enthusiast.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe works as a rolling stock engineer for a company that manufactures new trains and designs and constructs new rail lines .\n\n\n\n\n\nHis love of rail started when he was young, through a Japanese cartoon about a crime-fighting train.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The key changes homebuyers will need to keep an eye on in 2025\n\n\"It tells you how trains act like people to protect children,\" he said, describing the show.\n\n\n\n\n\nXu has since been in touch with the previous owner, who told them their father built the train network in the 1960s when they were a child.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set had likely not been used for some years, with the area full of spiderwebs when Xu first went beneath the house and found the dusty set.\n\n\n\nIt is not the project he had in mind when buying his house, but Daniel Xu has committed himself to restoring the old model train network he found beneath his home and hopes to upgrade some of the technology. Source: SBS News Xu, who said he already had a number or train toys and model trains, plans on getting the lines cleaned up, in order to test what still works and get the entire network back up and running.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the separate control desks for each of the different zones of the train tracks likely represented modern technology when first installed, Xu hopes to upgrade it with some newer technology to share his love of trains.\n\n\n\n",

Bezos's fame and Venice's stunning visual backdrop have offered them international visibility which they effectively exploited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No Space for Bezos\" banners draped over the iconic Rialto Bridge and a huge canvas laid out on St Mark's Square urging the tech billionaire to pay more taxes have been seen all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns of greater disruptions forced Bezos and his bride to move their final and biggest celebrity party from the central district to a more isolated venue in the eastern part of the lagoon city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea that the city should be seen as a set, a stage, or an amusement park has been highlighted like never before by Bezos' wedding,\" Tommaso Cacciari, a frontman for the No Space for Bezos movement, said.\n\n\n\nA thousand protesters from social centres and environmental associations participated in the demonstration against the exploitation of the city and marched through the streets. Source: SIPA USA / Roberto Brancolini In the final protest on Saturday (local time), around 1,000 residents and activists rallied in front of Venice's train station under a scorching sun, before marching roughly 1.5 kilometres to the Rialto Bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bezos, out of the lagoon\", the demonstrators chanted as they wound through the city centre, some brandishing signs that read: \"Eat the rich\", \"Rejected\", and accusations that Venice's mayor is \"corrupt\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOne banner proclaimed \"Kisses yes, Bezos no\", playing on Venice's reputation as the city of love, and another one said \"No space for Bezos\" with a rocket, in a reference to his Blue Origin space technology company.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenetian businesses and politicians, however, welcomed the event, hailing its major boost for the local economy. Luca Zaia, the regional governor of Veneto around Venice, said the city should be proud of hosting the wedding.\n\n\n\nProtesters demand affordable housing, oppose overtourism\n\nAlice Bazzoli, a 24-year-old university student, called Bezos a \"hypocrite\" for donating 3 million euros ($5.38 million) to Venice while flooding its fragile ecosystem with high-polluting private jets and yachts.\n\n\n\n\n\nBezos and Sanchez have given 1 million euros ($1.79 million) each to three Venetian institutions: CORILA, an academic consortium that studies the lagoon, UNESCO's local office, and Venice International University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd love Venice to be tailored for citizens, not for tourists, with affordable housing,\" Bazzoli said, complaining that students were being priced out of the market, with the best accommodations offered to visitors.\n\n\n\nThe 'Moa' boat transporting Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Bezos is escorted on the Grand Canal, on the third day of their wedding festivities. Source: AFP / Marco Bertorello Andrea Segre, a 49-year-old Italian film director born in Venice, said the city was also pushing out ordinary residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People aged 25 to 35 \u2014 the age group that starts families \u2014 cannot afford to live in Venice. The consequence is a lack of diversity and social liveliness,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenice is rapidly depopulating, largely because of the cost of living crisis. Its historic city centre now has fewer than 50,000 residents, compared to more than 100,000 some 50 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city has hosted scores of other VIP weddings, including that of actor George Clooney and human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, but the latest luxury nuptials have attracted far greater resentment because of Bezos' corporate and political role.\n\n\n\nJeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez leave the Aman Hotel on the third day of their wedding festivities.

Reuters news agency reported in February that Italian prosecutors were investigating alleged tax evasion worth 1.2 billion ($2.15 billion) euros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would have protested against Bezos even if he had come on a rowboat with just a handful of people ... because he contributed practically, materially and politically to Donald Trump's re-election,\" protest leader Cacciari said.\n\n\n\n",

I can't imagine ever going through that again,\" she says.\n\n\n\nYoung Chinese Australian Lucy Xu (pictured left as a child) says going no contact with her mother after coming out was the most painful period of her life. Source: Supplied / Lucy Xu The 24-year-old publishing and editing postgraduate student is one of many young Chinese Australians who struggle to balance being their authentic selves with being 'good' children to their first-generation Chinese Australian parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe explains the conflict stems from the divide between generally progressive values held by young Chinese Australians and the more traditional values often held by their parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor LGBTIQ+ young people like Xu, that divide can be particularly personal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I don't have my mum in my life, then it's kind of like I'm just floating around,\" she tells Chinese-ish, an SBS podcast exploring the daily life of young Chinese people in Australia .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think also being Asian Australian, growing up in Australia, especially surrounded by a lot more majoritively white communities, you kind of feel like you exist in this third space where you are Australian, but you're not really, and you are Chinese, but you're also not really.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it feels like when you lose something, it's so much more impactful because you already didn't have as much as someone else who was white growing up in Australia.\"\n\n\n\nLucy Xu (pictured as a child) wants to embrace her authentic self with the support of her Chinese-Australian family. Source: Supplied / Lucy Xu\n\nFamily therapy and a letter\n\nOne year after her mum first cut contact, Xu decided to reach out to her and proposed an unusual request: they go to therapy together.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mother had previously attended counselling sessions to process the loss of her husband, Xu's father. Understanding the benefits of talk therapy, she agreed to the request.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut finding the right therapist proved a challenging task for Xu, as her mother speaks Mandarin. While Xu can speak a little, she's not fluent. She also wasn't sure where to find therapists specialising in LGBTIQ+ mental health support while understanding intergenerational cultural dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I just googled 'Asian therapists who are in LGBTQ groups in Melbourne' and it came out with the contact of a Malaysian therapist who's also a gay man,\" she says.\n\n\n\nTo reconcile with her mother after coming out as a bisexual, Lucy Xu invited her mother to go through family therapy together. Source: Supplied / Lucy Xu Xu says the therapist \u2014 who speaks both Mandarin and English \u2014 has been key to helping her express feelings about her sexuality and communicate with her mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore embarking on a six-month therapy journey, Xu wrote a letter to her mother. In it, she tells her that she loves her and hopes she will come to accept her for who she is, saying: \"I love myself and know myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just remember afterwards she had a lot more questions for me about my sexuality,\" Xu says.\n\n\n\nSo she wanted to understand more and know more about this part of me, which I was really grateful for\n\n\"She was much more open talking about the topic with me, even if she didn't fully accept it.\"\n\n\n\nGrowing up in a bilingual household, Lucy Xu (second from right) says it was challenging to figure out the exact words to use when coming out to her mother. Source: Supplied / Lucy Xu\n\n'This is who I am'\n\nWhen coming out as gay to his family, Hong Kong-Australian filmmaker Victor Wu also wrote a letter to his parents, who both worked as a public servant in Hong Kong before arriving in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just kind of spelled out exactly how I felt, what my position was, which was that I was not asking for approval, I was not asking for acceptance,\" the 39-year-old says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[I wrote that] this is who I am. Their decision is whether they accept it, but their decision affects whether they have a place in my life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith support from his elder sibling, Wu's parents accepted his identity. But even before their son came out, Wu's parents already noticed stereotypes perpetuated against LGBTIQ+ people within certain parts of the Chinese-speaking expat community.\n\n\n\nHong Kong Australian filmmaker Victor Wu (right) says he wrote a letter to his parents when coming out as gay. Source: Supplied / Victor Wu He recalls that when his parents first arrived in Australia in 1994, they were introduced to an evangelical church that a longtime friend from Hong Kong also attended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We came back one day from church and mum was talking about how vicious the people at that church were about gay people, and how cruel they were,\" Wu says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But then she followed up saying that, 'you know, gay people are just mentally ill, they just needed to be treated'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese conflicted views aren't uncommon within the Chinese community in Australia, Wu says, while noting progress on marriage equality and LGBTIQ+ rights more generally has made many Chinese Australians more accepting toward queer people.\n\n\n\nBut the Chinese diaspora was among the groups targeted during the 2017 Marriage Law Postal Survey, with leaflets containing misinformation about same-sex marriage that claimed it would threaten their cultural values and identities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWu says while homophobia still exists in the community, there has been a shift in terms of what people are fearful of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the past, Chinese people or parents would see homosexuality as immoral,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But now gay marriage is legal, they won't think it's immoral, but rather, they are scared of how they would be viewed if other people know their kids are gay,\" Wu says, adding his parents once expressed concern about how coming out could affect his career.\n\n\n\nIncreasing everyday visibility within community\n\nWu believes the solution to counter lingering homophobia is to increase the everyday visibility of LGBTIQ+ people from the Chinese diaspora.\n\n\n\n[It's about] seeing people in our own communities, not seeing something in the media, but seeing some people in our schools, our workmates, weekend Chinese schools \u2026 that's going to change their minds.\n\nIt's a belief that underpins Wu's latest film, To Freely Flourish, which features a Chinese-Australian teenager coming out to his family at the height of the marriage equality debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also wants a broader range of Chinese-focused LGBTIQ+ stories to be portrayed in Australian media and entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think part of the problem is because the narratives in the media and storytelling are still so much around pain and tragedy and loss, and it's because we don't have these positive stories that queerness is equated to sadness, death, tragedy and pain,\" he says.\n\n\n\nVictor Wu says his film, To Freely Flourish, aims to counter the stigma some LGBTIQ+ Chinese Australians face. Source: Supplied / Victor Wu According to the 2021 Census, around two in 10 LGBTIQ+ Australians were born overseas, with 4.9 per cent of them speaking a language other than English at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving experienced the struggle of coming out in a cross-cultural setting firsthand, both Wu and Xu say getting involved with an LGBTIQ+ peer collective with shared cultural backgrounds has been helpful for them in navigating the challenges.\n\n\n\nAfter reading his letter, Victor Wu's parents decided to embrace their son's sexuality and gender identity. Source: Supplied / Victor Wu \"I think there's already people doing amazing things and leading the community, creating community \u2026 but we're not going to really learn about them as household names till much later,\" Wu says.\n\n\n\nHow to prepare for 'the talk'\n\nBefore broaching a conversation about sexuality or gender identity with parents, Ryan Qian from the health organisation for people of diverse sexualities and genders, ACON's peer education program, says it's important to know that coming out isn't \"necessary\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels like a social pressure to put on you that you have to come out, and it has to be a grounded thing,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThese things take time, and it's not just for you but also for your parents \u2014 some people can prepare for months or years.\n\nFor those considering coming out to their parents, Qian suggests joining a culturally specific LGBTIQ+ peer support group to navigate the balance between pursuing personal authenticity and maintaining cultural roots.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO After Marriage Equality: Growing Up Queer with Chinese Parents SBS English 25/06/2025 27:00 English\n\nQian says writing a letter can also be helpful for young people from multicultural backgrounds in communicating sensitive and personal matters with their parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Coming out has such a great impact when it comes to you and your family. It's a great challenge if you don't know how your parents are going to react, and sometimes language can be lost in translation,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stresses it's important to have a backup plan and prepare for adverse reactions before having the talk, such as researching emergency housing and counselling services to support the potential fallout with family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having a support network is essential before you come out.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Key Points 3D printing new homes can improve construction times by 40 per cent, compared to building with traditional methods.\n\nAustralia has seen single-storey 3D printed homes constructed, but the first such multi-storey home is being built.\n\nWith supply of new housing at its lowest in nearly a decade, there's hope this method will assist in meeting demand.\n\nAt first glance, a construction site in Melbourne's outer-western suburbs looks like any other. But there's one huge difference: the house isn't being built traditionally \u2014 it's printed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe property in the suburb of Wyndham is set to be Australia's first multi-storey 3D-printed home .\n\n\n\nHow do you print a house?\n\nPrinting a house starts the same way as building one, with a drawing from a draftsperson or architect.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then things take a different turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe property's blueprint or drawing is fed into a printer, which creates a physical structure by printing the material in layers.\n\n\n\n\"With 3D printing, it all gets digitised... [The] working drawing goes into a printer as a geometric code, and then it gets done,\" Ahmed Mahil, the CEO of Luyten, the Melbourne-based company printing the house in Wyndham, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the other trades will come and their jobs will be easier ... it'll become just plug and play,\" Mahil added.\n\n\n\n\"There will be no more thinking on site or trying to go from one remedy to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That obviously saves a lot of time in terms of workflow [as] it's just one material that you're dealing with.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the builder, the entire process of building \"80 per cent of the house\" in Wyndham took approximately three weeks.\n\n\n\nA solution to the housing crisis?\n\nThis is not the only 3D-printed home in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust last month, two single-storey homes were built in the New South Wales town of Dubbo as part of a 3D-printed social housing project.\n\n\n\nTechnology now allows a property's blueprint to be digitised and 'built' in layers, using a large-scale 3D printer. Source: Supplied / guteksk7/Getty Images With the average build time for a stand-alone home having increased by 40 per cent, according to Master Build Australia, developers say this technology could be a faster solution for countries facing a housing crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as the supply of new housing falls to its lowest level in nearly a decade, according the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council report in May.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report said 177,000 new homes were finished in 2024, a big gap from the estimated underlying demand of 223,000 for the same period.\n\n\n\nMahil believes 3D-printed homes could be the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe [they] will contribute significantly to reducing the issue with supply,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're talking about increasing the efficiency and the productivity ... A traditional builder does 10 houses a year. We can up that to 50 houses.\"\n\n\n\nA more sustainable option?\n\nSome experts consider the 3D printing method to be a more sustainable alternative to traditional processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are really big benefits to 3D printing and sustainability in construction,\" Kate Dunn, an academic at UNSW, told SBS News.\n\n\n\nAhmed Mahil says printing this 3D house cost 30 per cent less than a traditional construction. Credit: Supplied \"One of the biggest benefits is [that] you use way less material than you do in traditional construction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"3D printing gives us the opportunity to create quite customised forms that use substantially less concrete than traditional methods. So that's where the environmental impact happens, that reduction in material.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n3D-printed homes are also considered to be more affordable than traditionally built homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMahil claims his 3D-printed house cost 30 per cent less than a traditional build. However, there's been no official Australian research into the cost difference.\n\n\n\n'Industry shock' on human labour\n\nDespite the benefits, others worry the use of technology may reduce the demand for human labour.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to 2023 research by academics at Charles Darwin and Monash universities, the 3D technologies will \"reduce opportunities for many people working onsite\", which \"may cause political instability in particular economies\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australian homes are so cold \u2014 and what you can do about it\n\nHao Wu, an academic in Melbourne University's faculty of architecture, says the construction industry will have to adapt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The existing work-relation industry structure may be impacted [by] it and maybe gradually transform,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In some cases, it could be a industry shock.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Mahil suggests the new technology will help smaller businesses keep up with rising demand.\n\n\n\n",

The reserve was set at the same level, which is also where it sold under the hammer.\n\nAll four registered buyers were local to the eastern suburbs and all actively competed for the chance to secure \u201cCamelot\u201d as their principal place of residence.",

    "text": "With officials still trying to track down June 12's mystery $100 million winner, here's how last year's millionaires spent their prizes.\n\nIn 2024, more than 195.3 million winners took home over $4.84 billion in prize money, The Lott claims.. Source: The Lott\n\nAs lottery officials reveal they're still no closer to finding the mystery $100 million Powerball winner, from a competition drawn now over two weeks ago, they've released some of the incredible ways Australians have benefited from their wins.\n\nWhile it remains extraordinarily unlikely that an individual will ever win a Division One prize, it has been the case for a few lucky Aussies over the years.\n\nAccording to The Lott's Annual Winners report, there were 441 division one winning entries across the country last year across all lottery games, collectively delivering more than $1.56 billion in prize money.\n\nHow the lucky lottery winners spent their newfound fortunes\n\nIn 2024, one winner said they ordered a pair of \"hand-crafted leather dress shoes for themselves,\" while another purchased a 1936 Oldsmobile. A third winner marked the occasion by \"buying watches for close family members\" to help celebrate, and another took off to Las Vegas to attend a friend\u2019s Elvis-themed wedding. Another invested in electric mountain bikes to explore bush trails, while one recipient opted for a hair transplant in Istanbul, saying it boosted their self-confidence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmong their first reactions? Here\u2019s how some reacted.\n\n\"Yelled out, 'You beauty!' and scared the dog with my excitement.\"\n\n\"I let out a number of swear words and then spent most of the night checking my numbers.\"\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t form proper sentences and started stuttering. I couldn\u2019t believe my prize money.\"\n\n\"I was emotional because of what it meant for my family.\"\n\nWinners remain anonymous, but many have issued advice for those lucky enough to pocket a big win.\n\n\"It\u2019s very easy to go crazy early on, but my advice would be to calm down and carefully think about your future plans.\"\n\n\"Treat your win as an opportunity to improve your circumstances, so don\u2019t waste it.\"\n\n\"Ride the wave of all your emotions. Don\u2019t be afraid of the change. Trust your instincts.\"\n\n\"Sit back, think, and don\u2019t make hasty decisions. Take time to process.\"\n\n\"Tell very few people and write down who you told.\"\n\nThe Lott spokeswoman Anna Hobdell said only about 8 per cent of winners keep their prize completely under wraps. Source: The Lott\n\nOfficial's advice for those with a stake in the game\n\nIn 2024, more than 195.3 million winners took home over $4.84 billion in prize money, The Lott claims.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith June 12's $100 million Powerball prize still at large, the message from officials remains clear: keep your phone on. A quarter of winners (25 per cent) discovered their good fortune via a phone call, while 24 per cent found out by checking online.\n\nThe Lott spokeswoman Anna Hobdell said once the news sinks in, \"most winners can\u2019t wait to share the joy with people in the know\". \"Only about 8 per cent keep it completely under wraps and tell absolutely nobody,\" she said. \"Winners often tell us their bodies go into overdrive the moment they hear the life-changing news, with hearts racing, hands trembling, and even a wave of nausea setting in.\n\n\"For many, the best part of winning is being able to give back \u2014 whether it\u2019s helping their kids buy their first home, shouting a holiday for their friends, or even helping strangers who could use a hand.\"\n\nAccording to The Lott themselves, the chances of winning division one in Powerball, based on one standard game, are a vanishingly small one in 134,490,400.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf gambling is a problem for you, go to Gambling Help Online or call 1800 858 858.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
