(ABC Gippsland: Madeleine Stuchbery)\n\nMs McKinnon said women often got distracted at home, or felt guilty for taking time to sit and relax.\n\nShe said by heading away on a reading retreat, participants could unburden themselves of expectations or work, and could invest time in themselves.\n\nBeing in a bush environment is also a key part of the retreat, providing space for women to connect with nature, with other women, and with themselves.\n\n\"There's something about reading and talking about books that takes you to deeper levels quicker,\" Ms McKinnon said.\n\n\"You enter through a book, rather than if you just started with chit chat.\n\n\"Reading fiction is a great thing for your brain, for creating and fostering empathy, that's been proven.\"\n\nA regular women-only book retreat is held at Walkerville South in Victoria.

With burnout at unprecedented levels who doesn't dream of stepping away from it all and embracing a career break. But can it solve the problem?\n\nSymptoms can include low energy, motivation or mood; feeling isolated or trapped; disengagement from work; procrastination; decreased life satisfaction; disrupted sleep; and physical symptoms such as headaches and body pain.\n\nWomen's Agenda co-founder Angela Priestley said 61 per cent of the women who reported symptoms of burnout thought it stemmed from balancing home life and a career.\n\n\"The key thing that comes up over and over again, and we've done this for 10 years now, is the leading ambition for women \u2014 around 30-35 per cent \u2014 is to earn more,\" Ms Priestley said.\n\n\"I think we need to look at the societal structures that are creating the pressure.\n\n\"You can go on a retreat, you might go to a spa for a day or something, and that can be good \u2026 but that's not going to change the underlying reason behind what may have led to burnout.\"\n\nA place to pause\n\nCrystal Wells runs a series of reading retreats for women across regional Victoria, including in the noted book town, Clunes.\n\nShe said while a weekend off may not be the silver bullet to resolve broader societal pressures, carving out time for oneself could be a good tool to mitigate stress.\n\nWomen are seeking respite from their busy modern lives at reading retreats across Australia.

Fell way behind in the third set, too.\n\n\"I'm not a machine, you know,\" he said with the hint of a smile on Saturday.\n\n\"I also struggle, sometimes.\"\n\nSure, Jannik, maybe so.\n\nStill, Sinner is the top-ranked player in men's tennis and has won the past three grand slam tournaments played on hard courts, so no-one was surprised when he set aside some lapses and emerged to beat number 27 Denis Shapovalov 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 on Saturday to take his title defence at Flushing Meadows to the fourth round.\n\n\"That I have pressure and tension is normal.

He also won the trophy at Wimbledon on grass courts in July.\n\nBut Sinner's set streak in New York ended; he had claimed 14 in a row since dropping one in a victory against 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals a year ago.\n\nSinner explained that his serve did not feel quite right on Saturday, and that Shapovalov was reading it well.\n\n\"I was able to put pressure on Jannik today, so who says that another player can't do the same?\" Shapovalov said.\n\nSinner double-faulted to close the opening set, which earlier featured a remarkable 30-stroke point in which both men hit drop shots. Sinner took that point by sprinting back to the baseline and twisting his body to deliver a lob winner that floated just out of Shapovalov's reach.\n\nAfter rebounding to even the match at a set apiece, Sinner found himself trailing 3-0, love-30 in the third after Shapovalov grabbed 14 of 17 points.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

It was a very close match. A lot of games were very close,\" said Shapovalov, a left-hander from Canada who was a Wimbledon semifinalist in 2021.\n\n\"He's number one for a reason. He dealt with it really well. He fights extremely well. He did a tremendous job to turn it around down 3-0 in the third there.\"\n\nAP",

(Supplied: Mic Whitty)\n\nThe reality is that Mic has been living rough for 11 years following a chain of events that left him broke and sleeping in the Welsh wilderness.\n\nAs a weapons technician in Saudi Arabia, and later as an IT consultant, Mic had a good income and a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nWhen accepting a new job led to imposter syndrome and a mental health crisis in his early 40s, Mic moved to the United Kingdom, where he began working in a youth hostel.\n\n\"I was very happy, but I was on minimum wage,\" he said.\n\n\"I still had a champagne taste from my years in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"But I was on a beer budget, so I was burning through my resources.\"\n\nMic had a career with the RAAF and then a lucrative job in Saudi Arabia. (Supplied: Mic Whitty)\n\nGambling creeps in\n\nWith his savings quickly depleting, along with an inheritance from his parents, Mic turned to gambling in an attempt to maintain his lifestyle.\n\n\"That was the beginning of my downfall,\" he said.\n\nMic had never gambled before but began betting on stock market predictions.\n\nA win on his first day set him on a costly one-way path that changed the trajectory of his life forever.\n\n\"It seemed like a simpler way of 'investing' in the stock market, without having to buy and sell shares through a broker,\" Mic said.\n\nOver six years, Mic lost all of his savings and the inheritance his parents left him. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nVery quickly, Mic began losing significant amounts of money.\n\nTrapped by the gambler's fallacy, he was driven to \"win it back\" but was unable to recover his mounting losses.\n\nWith his savings gone, and an eye-watering 18 months of rent unpaid, Mic felt increasingly alone, desperate and ashamed.\n\n\"It's just a spiral down,\" he said.\n\nHe anxiously waited for a call from his landlord, a friend, to query the missing rent.\n\n\"As I've done many times before in my life when it comes to finances, I guess I just put my head in the sand,\" he said.\n\nWhen that call finally came, it was a moment of truth for Mic, and he chose honesty.\n\n\"If I've learned anything from studying politics and history, it's like Nixon and Clinton,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not the original sin that they got in trouble for. It's the cover after the lie.\"\n\nFrom bad to worse\n\nDetermined to repay his debt, Mic moved into the youth hostel where he worked, and with the support of his old landlord, came up with a payment plan.\n\nStill believing he could \"claw back\" his savings, Mic continued to gamble using the small amount of money he had left each month.\n\n\"I had gone through all my money, my parents' inheritance money,\" he said.\n\n\"That's where it really started unravelling.\"\n\nStream Mic Whitty's way out of the woods Photo shows Richard Fidler and Sarah Kanowski in front of a colorful background with the words \"Conversations 20th Anniversary Collection\" After walking away from his life, Mic re-entered the world again and came up with an extraordinary project.\n\nOver several months, Mic took money from his work to gamble and concealed it by \"fiddling the books\".\n\n\"It spiralled out to where I'd taken out about 1,600 GBP ($3,300). And I had nothing to put back in,\" he said.\n\nIt came to a head when his manager noticed what was happening and wracked with shame, Mic tearfully owned up to stealing the money.\n\nHe resigned and borrowed money from a friend to repay what he had taken.\n\nAlmost daily, Mic struggled with thoughts of taking his own life to end the intense shame he felt.\n\n\"I don't blame any of this on depression \u2026 I got depressed because of what I did,\" he said.\n\n\"I was in a pretty bad way.\"\n\nRetreating from the world\n\nDespite struggling with daily life, Mic found another job and remained determined to repay his friend.\n\n\"I was just, every day, dragging myself out of bed to go to work. And when I wasn't working, I was just staying in bed,\" he said.\n\nAs soon as Mic made the last repayment to his mate, he skipped his work shift and walked out of his \"old life\" without telling anyone.\n\nDiscarding his phone, unlocked in his room \u2014 with a message for his friends to find \u2014 Mic then left all of his belongings and caught a train to the end of the line.\n\nWhen he arrived in the small old mining town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in North West Wales, Mic walked off into the surrounding countryside.\n\nWith no tent or bedding, he found a secluded spot about 3 kilometres from town, and stayed there.\n\n\"As I think back on it now, it just sounds so irrational. But at the time I thought it was rational,\" Mic said.\n\n\"I went for a week without food, and I went probably two or three days before I crawled down to a creek just to drink some water.\n\n\" The only way I could see getting through the misery of it all is that I, in my mind, knew that the end was nigh. \"\n\nAfter a week in the woodland, Mic wandered into town to buy some food, but continued living rough, moving every couple of days to remain unnoticed.\n\nWithout basic comforts or entertainment, and with a makeshift bed fashioned from cardboard, Mic found sleep near impossible.\n\nBoredom and rumination quickly crept in.\n\n\"I wasn't sleeping at all really \u2026 it's a very long time with nothing to do,\" Mic said.\n\n\"And the nights are probably worse than the days. You're just lying there, not really sure how long you can keep on going.\"\n\nFinding his way back\n\nFor about three months, Mic hid away from his old life, too ashamed to reach out to friends.\n\nAfter enduring the uncertainty, isolation and monotony of living rough, things took a turn for Mic when he caught a bus to Aberystwyth, a small Welsh seaside town.\n\nHe spent a week feeling invisible until Mic noticed a Salvation Army church hall and the familiar logo of the Red Shield Appeal.\n\nDesperate for a cup of tea after months without, he gingerly walked over, hoping he could find some hospitality.\n\nA simple sign that read, \"Tea and coffee. All welcome\" led Mic through the doors of that hall where he befriended another man sleeping rough who took Mic under his wing and they enjoyed a hot lunch.\n\nNow cycling around Australia, Mic can make his own cuppa with his camp stove. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nOver the weeks to come, Mic made more friends at the Salvation Army, including the town's librarian, Catherine Taylor, who encouraged Mic to visit the library each day.\n\nThis gave him routine, a warm sanctuary and access to newspapers and books to occupy his mind again.\n\n\"Whenever the library was open, at nine in the morning till six at night, I was sitting in the library \u2014 six days a week,\" he said.\n\nCatherine's kindness extended to buying and sharing meals with Mic.\n\n\"I even ended up begging a couple of times on the streets, and she would be walking by with her family and this would upset her a great deal,\" he said.\n\n\"So she would drag me into a cafe and buy me something to eat and a coffee with her family \u2026 then she invited me to her home for a Sunday meal.\"\n\nIt was a gesture that Mic decided to honour with transparency about his past.\n\n\"As soon as I crossed the threshold, I said, 'I've got something to tell you \u2026 I stole money from work, and that's why I'm homeless,'\" he said.\n\nLibrarian Catherine Taylor befriended Mic, welcoming him into her home and the town's library for refuge. (Supplied: Maude Wells)\n\nTo Mic's surprise, Catherine replied with her own confession that she had Googled him, but in doing so, had discovered a Facebook page dedicated to finding him.\n\nThis revelation helped Mic realise that there could be a way out of his situation, and that many people cared about him.\n\nIt took some time to process, but finally, almost 10 months after first walking away from his life, Mic felt strong enough to re-emerge.\n\nHe posted a Facebook message letting his friends know where he was, that he was safe, and what had happened.\n\n\"The reaction to that, it still, nine years on, brings me to tears,\" Mic said.\n\n\" I had so many positive replies and so many expressions of love. \"\n\nA new purpose\n\nDuring Mic's process of reconnecting with his friends and his old life, he began pulling together his belongings that were stored in various friends' homes.\n\nWhile searching through a tea chest full of sentimental treasures, Mic found his grandfather's World War I pocket diary, which had taken a bullet for his grandfather while he was serving in the Australian artillery on the Western Front.\n\nAfter reconnecting with his life, Mic found his paternal grandfather's 1916 war diary, which bears the mark of a bullet. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nWith the diary in his hands, Mic was struck with the idea to honour his grandfather by riding his bike to Gallipoli, sleeping in a hammock along the way.\n\nOnce he arrived, Mic learnt that there are many war cemeteries at Gallipoli and he felt compelled to visit them all.\n\n\"I'd only really known of the ones we learned of in school; Lone Pine, The Neck, Anzac Cove,\" he said.\n\n\"It took me a couple of weeks, but I ended up cycling on my bike to all [the] cemeteries that are on the Gallipoli Peninsula.\n\n\"I was quite chuffed for myself. I noticed that \u2026 in a lot of them, it had been over a year since the previous person had signed in the visitors' book.\"\n\nMic reached the Lone Pine Cemetery on the Gallipoli Peninsula in March 2016. (Supplied: Mic Whitty)\n\nDiscovering how much he enjoyed cycle touring, and realising he had \"nothing else better to do\", Mic set himself a new and monumental goal.\n\n\"A bit like Forrest Gump, I'm now on a 30-year trip to cycle to every Commonwealth War Grave cemetery in the world,\" he said.\n\nMic Whitty is riding his way up the Queensland coast, hoping to arrive in Cooktown for Christmas. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nMic's itinerary takes in both purpose-built war cemeteries like the ones he visited in Gallipoli, as well as small-town 'regular' cemeteries where WWI or WWII casualties are buried.\n\nIf he sticks to his schedule, before the end of the centenary of World War II in 2045, Mic will have visited nearly 25,000 cemeteries.\n\n\"If I haven't finished by the time I'm 80, I'll just keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"If I happen to die beforehand, that solves the problem of 'What the heck do I do until I die?'\"\n\nMic, pictured at Gympie Cemetery, has been cycling around the world visiting war graves and has no plans to stop. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jennnifer Nichols)\n\nOn reflection\n\nAlmost 10 years since he started, Mick has no regrets and favours taking his trip one day at a time.\n\n\"I haven't looked back,\" he said.\n\n\"I absolutely love it. I would not swap this for anything else.\n\n\"It's not about the cemeteries \u2014 it's the people I meet along the way.\"\n\nWhile still technically a rough sleeper, Mic is living his best life on the road, wild camping by choice. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nMic told his story to Richard Fidler on Conversations in March last year, and has cycled a total of 67,022 kilometres, visiting more than 4,000 war grave cemeteries.\n\nThis year, he's been tracking his way up the east coast of Australia.\n\n\"I am aiming for Cooktown by Christmas, so if anyone spots me along the Queensland coast, please toot your horn,\" he said.\n\nAfter touring the war graves across almost 20 countries, Mic is now making his way around Australia. (Mic Whitty/ABC Sunshine Coast: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nAs he reflects on those dark, isolated months sleeping rough in Wales, Mic said it showed him an inner strength that he didn't realise he had.\n\n\"We're all a lot tougher than we think we would be when tested,\" he said.\n\nAs for that generous cup of tea Mic was offered by the Salvation Army, he still recalls it as \"fantastic\".\n\n\"You know how some people leave a bit of tea at the bottom of every cup? To this day, I drink all my tea,\" he said.\n\n\"And every time, I think just how lucky I am.\"\n\nStream the 20th Anniversary Collection of Conversations throughout August on the ABC listen app.",

    "text": "Australia's Wallaroos have battled to eke out a 31-31 draw against the USA in the most thrilling match yet at the Women's Rugby World Cup, with both sides still able to reach the quarterfinals.\n\nIn a thrilling contest in which both sides scored five tries on Saturday, brilliant doubles for Australian back-line stars Desiree Miller and teenager Caitlyn Halse at York Community Stadium were countered by a superb hat-trick from American flanker Freda Tafuna.\n\nWith the match in the balance, replacement prop Eva Karpani ploughed over for the Aussies' fifth try with five minutes left to level the scores, but half-back Sam Wood missed the conversion attempt that could have sealed the victory to guarantee a place in the last eight.\n\n\"On the whole, a bit disappointed, a bit flat,\" sighed the Wallaroos' English coach Jo Yapp, when asked how she felt.\n\n\"We let them into the game in that second half and our penalty-count (Australia 13 USA 6) allowed them access to our half, and when they're in there, they're hard to stop. Ultimately our discipline really let us down.\"\n\n\"We'll always reflect and look to bounce back \u2014 the girls have got a big game next week.\"\n\nThough the game had been billed as win-or-bust, the draw still allows both sides to dream, with everything now hanging on the final group A matches next week, with Australia facing the hot favourites and hosts England while the US plays Samoa.\n\nAustralia currently looks to be just about in the driving seat, as it has a mighty 135-points-difference advantage over the US, but if it cops a massive hiding from England and the Americans steamroll the exhausted Samoans, it is possible that could be overturned.\n\nBut the Australians' fate is in their own hands, if they can grab a bonus point against the English in Brighton.\n\nEngland earlier continued its magisterial progress, hammering Samoa 92-3 in Northampton after beating the US 69-7 in the opening match.\n\nIt was another performance designed to worry the Wallaroos that they could still be in trouble.\n\n\"The feeling's a bit mixed,\" co-captain Kaitlan Leaney said.\n\n\"We were on top in parts and they came back. We feel flat. It feels like a loss.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "This week, former West Coast Eagles defender Mitch Brown came out as the first current or former openly bisexual male player in the AFL's nearly 130-year history.\n\nHe said there were times in his life and career in the AFL when he stayed silent due to the \"fear of people thinking that I was gay or bisexual\".\n\nBrown will forever be etched into the game's history, but experts, advocacy groups and fans who have been pushing for systematic change say this is not a time for celebration.\n\nInstead, they say it's an opportunity for self-reflection.\n\nPraise for Mitch Brown after historic announcement Photo shows Mitchell Brown shouts at the crowd after a goal during a West Coast Eagles AFL game. Mitch Brown's historic announcement as the first publicly bisexual current or former male AFL player is met with support from across the sporting world.\n\n\"Our commitment is to keep making football an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone to thrive,\" wrote AFL CEO Andrew Dillon in response to Brown's announcement.\n\nBut the AFL has not kept the sport an inclusive place and homophobia is its biggest issue, said Dr Erik Denison, a behavioural scientist at Monash University who has studied homophobia in the sport.\n\nHe said the AFL's issues surrounding homophobia were \"deeply embedded\".\n\n\" The AFL does not deny that it has a serious homophobic, behaviour and cultural problem. \"\n\nIn 2014, the AFL signed a framework on national television to become a world leader in efforts to stop the pervasive homophobic language used at all levels of the game.\n\nThen-AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou committed to eliminating homophobia in the sport in 2014. (AAP: Daniel Munoz)\n\nEleven years later, that same organisation spent three days deliberating the fate of Crows star Izak Rankine for using a homophobic slur against a Collingwood player.\n\nThe AFL entertained \"compelling medical submissions\" from Adelaide before handing Rankine a polarising four-week suspension that left the door slightly ajar for him to pull on the jersey this year if the Crows lost the qualifying final but made it to the grand final.\n\nRankine's ban pales in comparison to widespread impact of homophobia Photo shows Izak Rankine of the Crows prepares before a game. Young LGBTQIA+ Australians are turning away from community sport due to the high prevalence of homophobia, queerphobia and discrimination.\n\n\"We still have more work to do and we are committed to that,\" AFL general counsel Stephen Meade said following the ban.\n\nBut Dr Denison said he \"couldn't really point to anything\" the AFL had done to drive change in the 11 years since it committed to combat homophobia.\n\n\"I don't think it's time for the AFL community to be congratulating itself, sort of saying 'job done, here look at us, we finally have an openly gay bisexual player',\" he said.\n\n\"This is time for the AFL community to really look in the mirror, listen to what Mitch Brown is saying, and do something about the problems that he's describing.\n\n\"This is an opportunity for the AFL to drive long-overdue change to culture and behaviour at all levels of the game.\"\n\n'Homophobia permeates every square centimetre'\n\nRankine's slur was the sixth publicised incident of homophobia within the AFL in the past year-and-a-half.\n\nDr Denison said the problem lay within how normalised homophobic language had become, used as \"day-to-day interactions\" that he compared to \"ritualistic bonding behaviour\".\n\n\"Hyper masculinity and homophobia permeate every square centimetre,\" he said.\n\n\" It's just part of the furniture, part of the fabric, part of the wallpaper, part of everyday interactions in the sport. This is all they know. \"\n\nCollingwood defender Darcy Moore said the league has an ongoing issue with homophobia.\n\n\"Clearly, the amount of on-field incidents over the last few years shows we do still have an issue,\" he said.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nIn the opening introduction to the AFL's inaugural LGBTQI+ action plan document released in 2024, CEO Andrew Dillon said, \"the game of AFL has not always been a safe space for LGTBQI+ people\".\n\nMoore, who is the current AFL Players' Association president, said it's time to make \"the game safer and more inclusive for everyone\".\n\n\"We want to see action, we want to see policy change, we want to see systems thinking about shifting it, for sure.\"\n\nNever a space to feel safe, even at local level\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Aus, Brown described the AFL's culture as \"hyper-masculine\".\n\n\"There was never once an opportunity to speak openly or explore your feelings or questions in a safe way,\" he said, adding that the weight of hiding his sexuality played a big part in his decision to retire at 28.\n\nThe former defender said the homophobia was pervasive and that one teammate said he would rather be in a cage full of lions than have to shower next to a gay man.\n\n\"There's been so many times in my life that I've seen things or heard things and not said anything, in fear of people thinking that I was gay or bisexual,\" he said.\n\nDr Denison said he \"would expect the AFL to apologise to Mitch [Brown] for not creating a safe environment for him to play his sport\".\n\n\"Mitch [Brown] was describing that he retired from the AFL, he says, because of wanting to escape this culture; he realised it was really unhealthy,\" he added.\n\nAnd it doesn't just happen at a professional level.\n\nAmateur football player Michael O'Donnell said the culture begins at a local level and was ever-present in the sport when he grew up before he came out.\n\nMichael O\u2019Donnell said in 2023 he hopes young gay players will have someone to look up to in the AFL. (Four Corners: Craig Hansen)\n\n\"Even as a 13-year-old, when I knew sort of who I was as a person, I looked around and thought, look, I'm not in a place that would accept me if I did come out,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a language, it was the way people spoke, not just around the football in a club culture, but in the crowds, in the media,\" Mr O'Donnell said, who currently plays for UNSW's Eastern Suburbs Bulldogs in Sydney.\n\n\" It's really hard to be what you can't see. \"\n\nMr O'Donnell said that Brown's announcement was an \"opportunity for reflection and education for so many people\".\n\n\"It's not just a lesson for his teammates, hopefully it's a lesson for current AFL players, both of the local level and the professional level, to see the damage these sorts of comments can make.\"\n\nQueer woman Sarah Pepper, who played football at various levels spanning almost a decade, said that local football clubs were a breeding ground for homophobia.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"There is such a stereotype of what a male AFL player is expected to look like and act \u2014 and that is ingrained in the roots of local men's football,\" she said.\n\n\"You've got to work from local up, because that's where that toxic image develops in their minds.\n\n\"If you fix anything at its root, you fix the problem.\n\n\"All people should be able to play the sport and not feel like they can't because they don't fit the norm of what is currently expected in the male sporting world.\"\n\nDr Dennison agreed, claiming that players were \"using this language to conform and belong and be part of the group\".\n\n\"A player doesn't wake up in the morning and think, 'I'm going to use homophobic language today or sexist language'. They go into the club environment and they're often mimicking each other.\"\n\nAFLW more inclusive and supportive\n\nUnlike the AFL, a large percentage of players from the AFLW are part of the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nWhat society can learn from AFLW Pride Round Photo shows GettyImages-1763979293 The league's stars explain why Pride Round is so important, and why there is still a long way to go.\n\nFormer AFLW great and commentator Kate McCarthy said it was because the league was introduced after many of the players were already out and happy to identify as queer.\n\n\"I was happy with who I was as a person, and then I was playing AFLW,\" she told Triple M's Rush Hour with James Brayshaw and Billy Brownless.\n\n\"We had already come to that realisation ourselves, and weren't thrust into the spotlight and had to try and work out whether we told people or not: we just were.\"\n\nA dedicated Pride Round was introduced in the AFLW in 2021. There is still yet to be a Pride Round introduced in the men's game.\n\nProblems can't be fixed with just education modules\n\nDr Denison said as the behaviours were socially caused, \"you need social solutions\".\n\nThis season, the AFL launched a new LGBTQI+ education module that all players and officials were required to complete to combat homophobia.\n\nABC Grandstand commentator Corbin Middlemas said to his knowledge, a lot of players do not complete the module as intended.\n\n\"Speaking to some former players \u2026 a lot of the answers to those modules get shared in a WhatsApp group, essentially the players click through to the end, put in the answers and off they go,\" he said.\n\n\"Is that the best way forward?\n\n\" A place that's been a breeding ground for homophobia for 100 years is what we're basically trying to change here. \"\n\nMany in the AFL community say more education is required to tackle the issue of homophobia. (AAP: David Moir)\n\nPlayers use harmful homophobic language to confirm and belong, Dr Denison said.\n\n\"That's why you can't fix these problems with education training modules or posters,\" he said.\n\n\"That has no effect on the social dynamics in the club environment that are causing these behaviours.\"\n\nBrown's former West Coast Eagles coach Adam Simpson said that he had reflected this week on how he, the club and the league treat the issue of homophobia.\n\n\"You think you're going OK, but there's always improvement,\" he said, adding that everyone in the league should take time to reflect.\n\n\"That's why we've all evolved \u2014 it's generational as much as it's education.\"\n\nThe AFL and the AFL Players Association have been contacted for comments.",

    "text": "Alex de Minaur has surged into the US Open second week for a fifth time with a business-like win over wounded German Daniel Altmaier.\n\nAustralia's last player standing once more, de Minaur recovered from a set down to progress after Altmaier retired injured when di Minaur was leading 6-7 (9-7), 6-3, 6-4, 2-0 on Saturday (Sunday AEST).\n\nAltmaier had battled for more than four hours and saved a match point in an epic third-round triumph over Stefanos Tsitsipas, after a five-set win over Hamad Medjedovic in the opening round.\n\nHe fought valiantly to back up and looked on track to cause a big upset when he took the first set in a tie-break after trailing three points to none.\n\nAltmaier had his chances in the second set as well, but the energetic de Minaur was a man on a mission and pounced after his sapped opponent required two medical time-outs to treat a thigh strain.\n\nOnce down two sets to one, Altmaier looked a man resigned to defeat and Australia's eighth seed moved in for the kill.\n\nA model of consistency, de Minaur has now made the last 16 at eight of the past nine grand slams.\n\nThe 26-year-old has a huge opportunity to make the Open quarterfinals for a third time when he faces Swiss qualifier Leandro Riedi, the world number 435, in the fourth round.\n\nRiedi had beaten Argentine 19th seed Francisco Cerundolo in five sets in the opening round, and he was up against world number 76 Kamil Majchrzak when the Polish player retired at 5-3 down in the first set.\n\nOsaka too strong for Kasatkina\n\nDaria Kasatkina recovered from a first-set 'bagel' to force Naomi Osaka to three sets at the US Open before bowing out of the tournament. (Getty Images: Maddie Meyer)\n\nFour-times major champion Naomi Osaka has powered to the US Open fourth round with a 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 win over Australian 15th seed Daria Kasatkina to continue her best grand slam run since 2021.\n\nOsaka lit up Louis Armstrong Stadium in broad daylight, turning her third-round clash into a showcase of power and composure.\n\nThe Japanese player dominated early, absorbed a brief second-set wobble, and closed out the win to set up a blockbuster fourth-round showdown with American third seed Coco Gauff.\n\n\"Honestly, I was trying to tell myself to stay calm. I was so shaky today but I'm glad that it was an entertaining match,\" Osaka said.\n\n\"Whenever I come here it feels like home and you guys are very involved and I feel grateful. Thank you.\n\n\"Can someone come to the match and cheer for me?,.\n\n\"I mean it's kinda tough playing an American here but I hope you guys have adopted me. I kinda see her as a little sister so it's cool to be playing her here.\"\n\nFrom the first point, Osaka looked sharp, putting pressure on Kasatkina with an early break gifted to her by a double fault before racing into a 3-0 lead.\n\nKasatkina's delivery deserted her in the first set with eight double faults and only 25 per cent of first serves landing as Osaka coolly dished out a bagel in 22 minutes.\n\nKasatkina, however, forced a decider after a scrappy second set riddled with breaks. Errors crept in on both sides, Osaka's frustration surfaced, and Kasatkina steadied enough to seize the lead.\n\nSeven service breaks kept the set on edge before the Russian-born player finally held her nerve to level the match.\n\nOsaka, however, regained her composure in the third.\n\nShe saved a break point with two blistering winners and surged into a 3-1 lead before closing out the match to stay on course for a third US Open title.\n\nShe will next play Gauff, who downed Polish player Magdalena Frech 6-3, 6-1 on Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nAAP/Reuters/ABC",

    "text": "As far as rubbish goes, it smells pretty good.\n\nFormer barista Ninna Larsen wheels a common rubbish bin forward, opens the lid and dumps a full load of coffee grounds.\n\nNext to the pile of dark brown and black grounds is another, bigger mound, consisting of animal faeces, food waste and plant matter. This one smells less appealing.\n\nMs Larsen has another nine bins full of coffee grounds in the back of her van to be unloaded at Melbourne Zoo and sit right next to the zoo's organic waste dump.\n\n\"We have a partnership with around 400 cafes around Melbourne,\" she tells the ABC between loads.\n\n\"We collect around 1.2 tonnes of coffee per run and we have about two to three runs a day, so significant amounts of coffee a day.\"\n\nReground aims to transform coffee grounds into compost to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (ABC News: Iskhandar Razak)\n\nEleven years ago, Ms Larsen started Reground, a social enterprise that collects coffee waste to be reused.\n\nShe did it after finding out how much environmental harm Melbourne's love affair with lattes, long blacks and flat whites can cause.\n\n\"In landfill, coffee grounds emit a lot of toxic gases,\" she said.\n\nThe emissions include methane gas.\n\nAnd Matt Genever, the CEO of Sustainability Victoria, said those emissions were a national problem \u2014 especially because Australia generated about 75,000 tonnes of ground coffee waste every year.\n\nReground's Ninna Larsen worked with Sustainability Victoria CEO Matt Genever to help turn the coffee grounds into compost. (ABC News: Iskhandar Razak )\n\nBut environmental groups have come up with an ingenious solution.\n\nSustainability Victoria has granted Reground more than $400,000 in recent years to help turn the grounds into compost, which doesn't emit harmful gases.\n\nCoffee grounds on their own are too acidic to be used in a garden.\n\nBut if properly mixed with organic matter like animal waste, they can be highly effective fertilisers because they are high in potassium and nitrogen.\n\nAnd one partner with an ample and never-ending supply of animal waste ready to be transformed is Zoos Victoria.\n\n750 kilograms of animal waste\n\nMelbourne Zoo has hundreds of animals creating waste every day.\n\nThen there are food scraps from animals and visitors alike, as well as plant litter from dozens of gardens and enclosures.\n\n\"We produce about 1,000 tonnes a year of organic waste, Sarah Larkin from the zoo's sustainability team said.\n\n\"So that equates to 3,000 kilograms a day.\"\n\nOf that, about 750 kilograms are daily animal waste.\n\nGiraffes are contributing more waste to the compost program than any other animal at Melbourne Zoo. (Supplied: Zoos Victoria)\n\n\"The giraffes are the biggest contributors and now we have a new calf, we'll get even more from them,\" Ms Larkin said.\n\nAll of this organic waste is put through what's known as the \"Hot Rot\".\n\nIt is a 10-metre-long machine that mulches and churns organic waste into compost \u2014 including the coffee leftovers from Reground.\n\n\"Everything goes into it,\" Ms Larkin said.\n\n\"We have tigers and lions, so carcasses go into it. Bone is in there. Fruit from all of our animals. All sorts of organic rich material.\n\n\"It's already nutrient-dense.\n\n\"But it is a more nutrient-rich product with the coffee. And Reground drops off three-times a week.\"\n\nMillions of kilograms of coffee grounds diverted\n\nOnce churned, the Hot Rot material comes out a very dark brown.\n\nBut despite the volume of excrement, once it is mixed and churned, the end product doesn't stink.\n\nInstead, it has an earthy odour.\n\nMelbourne Zoo is one of the zoos using the recycled compost in its gardens. (ABC News: Iskhandar Razak)\n\nThe zoo previously sold its compost to the public, but now only uses it on its own premises.\n\nHowever, there are plans make it available to the community again soon.\n\nMs Larsen is quick to quote her enterprise's environmental impact.",

    "text": "Ben Picton, a senior macro strategist at Rabobank, had some interesting things to say last week.\n\nIn some notes to investors, he criticised Australia's housing policies, questioned the illusory nature of Australia's housing wealth, and critiqued the development model that Australia keeps pursuing.\n\nHe said the United States economy was also being re-made by the Trump administration at an \"astonishing rate\" and the commentariat was \"clearly struggling to keep up\".\n\nHe said traders needed to realise that the old playbook for global markets had disappeared.\n\nThe new paradigm of raw power politics\n\nHe made his argument in a couple of research notes (found here and here).\n\nHe began with the United States.\n\nHe said US President Donald Trump was now treating the US Federal Reserve similarly to the US Supreme Court, by seeking to stack the Fed with \"ideological fellow travellers\".\n\nBen Picton is a senior macro strategist from Rabobank Australia. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)\n\nHe said it was further evidence that Trump's White House was dispensing with the \"fiction\" that central organs of government, like central banks, are politically neutral institutions:\n\n\"The unabashed politicisation of the supposedly independent and technocratic process of setting the price of money once again confirms that it is no longer the 1990s and that old ideas about optimal policy transmission, central bank credibility, and the need to insulate important decisions from the influence of the popular will offers little protection against the new paradigm of raw power politics. \"Just as the interpretation of law is inherently political, the price of money is inherently political, and all aspects of national policy are being co-opted to support the MAGA vision of the United States and its place in the world.\"\n\nHe then shifted to Australia's housing market, questioning the nature of the \"wealth\" it is creating:\n\n\"The political nature of the price of money is, of course, a feature of other economies, too. \"Down Under in Australia the Reserve Bank has recently cut rates for the third time \u2014 sparking another wave of [fear of missing out] buying in the country's already poisonously expensive housing market. \"Tellingly, UBS's latest Global Wealth Report places Australia second only behind tax haven microstate Luxembourg in terms of the median household wealth. \"By far the largest driver of Australia's household wealth is real estate, accounting for 53 per cent of the total compared to just 30 per cent in the United States. \"The relative proportions of Australia's wealth composition versus [other countries] certainly raises questions about how much of that household wealth is illusory and liable to disappear when the housing market eventually reverts to fair value (as it always does).\"\n\nHe then criticised the Albanese government's latest announcement to allow more first home buyers to purchase a property with a 5 per cent deposit.\n\nA big dose of financialisation\n\nSome quick background on this point.\n\nOn Monday last week, the Albanese government announced its decision to begin its expanded \"Home Guarantee Scheme\" earlier than planned.\n\nIt said its updated scheme would start on October 1, three months earlier than scheduled. (It had taken this policy to the federal election.)\n\nFive per cent home deposit scheme to begin in October Photo shows A child scooters in front of a row of houses. A scheme to allow all first homebuyers to purchase a property with only a 5 per cent deposit will begin in October, three months earlier than Labor promised at the federal election.\n\nUnder the scheme already in place (introduced by the Morrison government in 2020), the federal government has been guaranteeing a portion of a first home buyer's home loan so they can purchase a home with a 5 per cent deposit and not pay lenders mortgage insurance.\n\nBut from October 1, the Albanese government will remove the cap on how many first home buyers can access the scheme each year, it will remove the income limit for applicants, and it will set a higher price cap for properties that can be purchased by applicants.\n\nTreasury estimates an extra 20,000 guarantees will be issued in the first year of the expanded, uncapped scheme.\n\nIt says the scheme will also save young people between $87,000 and $350,000 in rent by drastically reducing the time it will take them to save a deposit and buy a home and get out of the private rental market.\n\nSee its modelling below:\n\nOn the ABC's News Daily podcast, Alan Kohler said that, by opening up the 5 per cent deposit scheme to all first home buyers, the Australian government was essentially taking over the lenders mortgage insurance industry (which the industry isn't happy about).\n\nLoading...\n\nAnd many economists have expressed frustration with the policy.\n\nThe independent economist Saul Eslake said he could understand why young people might like the expanded scheme, but it wasn't going to address the underlying problems with Australia's housing system.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nAnd Mr Picton joined the group of analysts criticising the scheme:\n\n\"Seemingly content to sacrifice their young to the Moloch of housing market speculation, the Australian government is continuing to do its best to ensure that fair value is never achieved and has \u2026 announced that they are 'helping' by bringing forward a scheme for the government to credit wrap first homebuyers with deposits as small as 5 per cent. \"To put that another way, the taxpayer will be providing credit guarantees for buyers who are just 5 per cent away from negative equity in a generationally expensive market. \"Concurrently, the ABC reports that thousands of houses purpose-built for the disabled on city fringes (where services for people with disabilities are thin on the ground) through the promise of turbocharged returns underwritten by a massive government honeypot for the investors who stumped up the capital are sitting empty \u2014 because not enough people with disabilities want to live there. \"Totally not 2008 vibes at all. \"This sort of silliness is common in Australia where there is apparently no problem that a big dose of financialisation can't 'fix' by creating new and bigger problems.\"\n\nTrump is the director-in-chief of the US economy\n\nHe then tied all of the issues together.\n\nHe said there were clearly serious economic issues at play in Australia and the US:\n\n\"Australia's government [has] also committed to another round of cuts to 'nuisance' tariffs right at the time where the rest of the developed world is realising that \u2013 with the benefit of hindsight \u2013 such moves in the 1980s might have been a bad idea and the ability to make stuff in your own country is actually a very useful thing sometimes. \"Contrast that thinking to what is happening in the USA, where Intel has apparently just agreed to allow the US government to take a 10 per cent stake in the company to ensure that strategically important semiconductor manufacturing occurs inside the United States and is treated as a national security priority. \"Thinking from first principles, economics is the study of scarcity and it is the job of national governments to arrange the scarce factors of production (land, labour and capital) to best ensure the prosperity and security of their people. \"Very clearly we are seeing two very different approaches to this problem of scarcity emerging. \"Is the wealth of nations best employed to bid up the housing stock, making do-nothing speculators and ticket-clipping middlemen (real estate agents, mortgage brokers, banks etc) in the rentier economy fat? \"Or is it better employed to ensure supremacy of real production and the dominance of strategic supply chains vis-\u00e0-vis potential adversaries?\"\n\nAnd he said investors needed to realise how much the world had changed.\n\nHe said the Financial Times was now describing Donald Trump as the Dirigiste-in-chief who has opened the door to state-run capitalism in the US.\n\n\"Which of course he is,\" he wrote.\n\nDirigism is a system in which the government uses far heavier hands to direct economic activity to fulfil the state's economic objectives, rather than being non-interventionist.\n\nVested interests and Australia's economy Photo shows Cascading rooftops in a brand new housing development in Alkimos, Western Australia. Australia is good at producing things, but it has excelled at producing vested interest groups that control key sectors of the economy.\n\n\"The Republican Party of Ronald Reagan is not the Republican Party of Donald Trump,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Friedmanite ideas of free markets and low touch government are out and a strong executive hand on the economic tiller is now very much in.\n\n\"For the first time in a long time the United States is back in the game of economic planning with a coherent (albeit risky) economic, industrial, financial \u2026 and military strategy now adopted to achieve foreign policy objectives.\n\n\"Many markets currently pricing for perfection \u2013 or for the assumed continuation of a single globalised system of prices \u2013 in the most imperfect of market conditions run the risk of being mugged sooner or later.\"\n\nThen a few days later, on Friday, just to add to the chaos for investors, the US Court of Appeals ruled that most of Donald Trump's tariffs were illegal.\n\nIt said the tariffs could remain in place until October 14 to give the Trump administration time to file an appeal with the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn response, Trump claimed the ruling was \"incorrect\" and it had been made by a \"highly partisan appeals court\".\n\nAnd he confidently predicted that, with help from the US Supreme Court (which has been stacked with judges by Republican presidents), the United States \"will win in the end\".",

The energy in the arena only properly heats up once Cabello returns to the tracks most of her fans fell in love with her for \u2013 the upbeat Latin flare of Bam Bam and the sultry salsa-inspired sound of Havana. Here, the crowd heaves with excitement, everyone swaying their hips in almost perfect unison. Camila Cabello hasn\u2019t performed in Australia since opening for Taylor Swift during the Reputation Tour. Credit: Richard Clifford It\u2019s during these moments, when Cabello essentially has the crowd eating from her hand, that she herself appears to have the most fun. During the nu-disco pop track Quiet, she even implores the audience to go completely silent \u2013 a rare feat for an arena gig \u2013 before ramping their cheers up again at her own command. \u201cI\u2019ve stuffed my face with Tim Tams. I\u2019ve even done a Tim Tam slam. I hope we return to Australia. We flew our butts all the way over here, and you\u2019ve been the best crowd ever. You\u2019ve been better than the best \u2013 you\u2019ve been supersonic,\u201d Cabello says, before seamlessly launching into I Luv It.\n\nCabello has said her new era is about embracing transformation and change. Yet, the best parts of her tour are when she reverts to the very sound that earned her multiple Grammy nominations back in 2019. Ultimately, Cabello has more sway than swagger, but perhaps we need to accept she\u2019ll \u201cnever be the same\u201d as before.\n\nReviewed by Nell Geraets JAZZ\n\nPaul Grabowsky and Michelle Nicolle | Noir \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nPrimrose Potter Salon, Melbourne Recital Centre, August 30 It\u2019s hard to believe that Paul Grabowsky and Michelle Nicolle \u2013 both peerless artists and long-time luminaries of the Australian jazz scene \u2013 have never collaborated until now. Pianist Paul Grabowsky Credit: Alice Healy Yet Noir, their newly released album, marks their first musical outing together. Saturday\u2019s concert (the first of two sold-out Melbourne shows) served as the official album launch, and the intimacy of the Recital Centre Salon made it the perfect setting for this repertoire.\n\nAs the title suggests, Noir luxuriates in darkness with songs of sadness and yearning, dashed dreams and broken hearts. Most of the songs are well-known, but stripped of their glossy patina to expose the honesty and fragility of the emotions they express. On stage, Nicolle exudes a natural warmth and positivity that bubbles up whenever she chats to the audience. But in this setting, as soon as Grabowsky\u2019s hands touched the keys \u2013 setting the scene with quietly brooding introductions \u2013 Nicolle cloaked herself in the shadows of each song and its characters, making us believe these stories were her own. Jazz singer Michelle Nicolle. Credit: Giuseppe Dante Sapienza In classic film noir, the woman is often a femme fatale, her deceitful intent hidden under a seductive surface. Nicolle is the opposite, willing to unmask and reveal the inner workings of a tender heart. Her exquisite vibrato suggested a trembling vulnerability on Michel Legrand\u2019s I Will Wait For You, as Grabowsky\u2019s delicate accompaniment underlined the bittersweet beauty of the lyrics. Heartbreak Hotel \u2013 forever associated with Elvis\u2019 sensual swagger \u2013 was reharmonised to accentuate the melancholy beneath the bluesy exterior, while I\u2019m a Fool to Want You illuminated the darkness with flecks of light, courtesy of a Latin-tinged lilt and gently playful extemporisations on the melody.\n\nGrabowsky\u2019s own Rainbow Cake (co-written with Vince Jones) fitted perfectly into this repertoire with its mood of wistful nostalgia, as did Nicolle\u2019s disarmingly poignant One Beer. Yes, it was an hour of sad songs, but these superb artists \u2013 who understand the value of sincerity and understatement \u2013 made it a pleasure to escape into the shadows.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas DANCE\n\nScenarios and Copy of the Copy \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until August 30 Both works currently showing at Dancehouse circle around problems of replication and imitation. These are enduring fascinations for choreographers but what makes this evening interesting is the contrast: one work meditates on sameness, while the other insists on difference. Scenarios is playful but also intimate. Credit: Takeshi Kondo\n\nScenarios, created and performed by Benjamin Hurley and Scott Elstermann, plays like a queer duet of self-fascination. Each performs as if the other were a mirror, a copy with no original, doubling gestures until resemblance tips into a kind of dreamy hallucination. Their shared identity is really a shared sensibility. A kind of rococo dandyism in duplicate. Movements are upright, measured and immaculately shaped. It\u2019s disciplined dancing, with obsessively worked symmetries, synchronicities and long phrases that develop with tricky vocalisations. Copy of the Copy is interested in the way dance passes from body to body, teacher to pupil. Credit: Tiffany Garvie They cycle through many images or scenarios. A well-chosen text hints at the thrill of seeing yourself as another, while a darker vignette evokes the doppelg\u00e4nger bent on self-annihilation. Yet the mood remains playful \u2013 even a little screwy \u2013 throughout these transformations. It\u2019s cute but also intimate. In the end, the audience itself becomes a reflective medium, placed before the twins like one of the mirrors that organise the space, as if their doubled identities require us to be the final surface in which their resemblance is registered.\n\nPriya Srinivasan, by contrast, in Copy of the Copy, is less concerned with uncanny reflections than with the way dance passes from body to body, teacher to pupil. In that transfer, copies are never exact: something is lost and something else is gained. Her work is resolutely theatrical, combining dance, video, audience interaction and even a little cooking. The registers are also multiple \u2013 comic, earnest, scholarly, confessional \u2013 and they continually shift. The effect is of a layered inquiry, staging transmission itself as a complex, unstable process. Loading Central to the performance is Srinivasan\u2019s own dance lineage: her teachers and the teachers who taught them. As the work culminates, however, we get a more expansive mapping of connections, a deliberately overwhelming series of names stretching from the present to the late eighteenth century, crisscrossing continents, empires and colonies. As the names pile up, distinctions blur: which connections were fleeting encounters and which were nurtured over many years? Yes, we get a sense of the density of intercultural traffic, but the concept of the copy becomes a little vague and underdefined.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size A former town planner, a mum-of-two, a DIY queen and a \u201ckerbside collection addict\u201d. Geneva Vanderzeil is a woman of many talents, and sitting in her Highgate Hill studio on Brisbane\u2019s south is like sitting in a craft-lover\u2019s dream. Renovated dollhouses sit on benches, a glass brick lamp is placed on the table, and paint splatters are plentiful. It\u2019s a weekday morning, and we\u2019ve come together to talk about her new book New Again \u2013 the third she\u2019s released and an ode to her crafty nature. \u201cNew Again is a masterclass in transforming and upcycling, and restoring your furniture and decor,\u201d she explains. The book is a culmination of about 15 years of knowledge and a way for her fans \u2013 1.3 million of them on Instagram and over 750,000 on TikTok \u2013 to glimpse her thought process for tackling projects. \u201cPeople say, \u2018I want to have your brain\u2019, but it\u2019s actually not my brain, it\u2019s just a certain way of looking at things, like seeing the potential of what\u2019s in front of you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer journey to becoming a household name in craft and DIY circles began in 2010 with the creation of her DIY fashion blog. As she dedicated more time and effort to her craft, she was able to leave her job as a town planner to pursue it full-time. Geneva Vanderzeil has amassed over 2 million followers on Instagram and TikTok with her crafty tutorials. Credit: Brittney Deguara Sharing her dollhouse obsession Now she\u2019s become a master of all things DIY \u2013 from turning a glass brick into a lamp, to turning a clock into a dollhouse. The latter, she admits, is one of her obsessions. \u201cThe dollhouse addiction has been a bit of a journey,\u201d she says. She shares her studio with several toy houses, including one built by her husband\u2019s grandfather that she carefully renovated over two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did a cafe dollhouse, a tree dollhouse, a clock dollhouse. It\u2019s gotten a little bit out of hand.\u201d She now offers a popular online course in making dollhouses, alongside embroidery and furniture upcycling courses. These are more than downloadable PDFs: they include between 40 and 50 detailed videos showing the techniques required to make the chosen project. Next on the to-do list are courses on mosaics and sewing. \u201cIt just comes down to the projects people are asking the most questions about,\u201d she explains. A kerbside collection \u2018addict\u2019 Living in Brisbane has proved a valuable inspiration for Vanderzeil and her projects, with the city\u2019s subtropical elements bleeding into her work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always thinking about the design of my home, which is cottage-y and a little bit mid-century, when I\u2019m thinking about the projects that I do,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople love the look and the feel of Brisbane\u2019s lifestyle, so I channel that into the projects.\u201d Loading One element that\u2019s hard for her global audience to replicate, however, is the city\u2019s kerbside collection program. Brisbane City Council\u2019s annual trash clean-out has become an invaluable resource for Vanderzeil \u2013 and one she encourages crafty Brisbane residents to make the most of. \u201cI am addicted to kerbside collection. I think we\u2019re quite lucky in Brisbane. \u201cIt\u2019s also legal in Brisbane to go and pick up things that you think will look good in your space or that you can transform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always so amazing to see what\u2019s out there ... more often than not, they\u2019re pieces that just need a little bit of love and a little bit of elbow grease to give them a whole new life.\u201d For those eager to trawl through suburbs on the hunt for a kerbside gem, Vanderzeil\u2019s advice is simple. You can\u2019t go wrong with a good-quality timber piece of furniture; it might just need to be sanded back and stained. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to look perfect to have a lot of potential because you can always do so much to a piece.\u201d \u2018Start really small\u2019 Vanderzeil\u2019s studio is filled with gadgets, paint samples and brushes, but she says you don\u2019t need a stocked toolkit to get started. \u201cJust start really small,\u201d she advises. \u201cStart with a project, work out what you need for that project, and begin gathering your toolkit that way \u2013 just project by project.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "The school introduced a Greek dancing program in 1974, which continues to feature prominently in Brisbane\u2019s Paniyiri Festival each year. The inner-south school lost one of its oldest structures \u2013 a 120-year-old fig tree \u2013 in 2014, which former principal and current 150th anniversary committee chair Judy Thompson said had been a key part of the school\u2019s identity. Former West End State School long-time teacher Mary Skarparis and former principal Judy Thompson hold an image of the fig tree that stood for more than a century on the site. Credit: Catherine Strohfeldt \u201cIt became a symbol of the strong roots and traditions, and just that protection, that comfort, and that welcome,\u201d she said. The site of the tree is now a meeting place in the centre of the campus, and the school\u2019s current emblem and new song feature the tree.\n\nThompson also worked as a principal of Kelvin Grove State College from 1999 to 2008, organising the school\u2019s 125th celebration in 2000. \u201cWhen Kelvin Grove started, [it] started down the bottom of the hill at Newmarket Road as a provisional school. Then the government, in the 1870s, set aside 108 acres of land on that hill from Kelvin Grove Road all the way down and called it Victoria Park,\u201d Thompson said. Kelvin Grove State Provisional School, around 1900. Credit: Kelvin Grove State College \u201cThat area was gazetted in the 1870s for education and sport.\u201d The school\u2019s current campus, abutting QUT, is the site of the original Kelvin Grove Road Provisional State School. Kelvin Grove State High School was opened almost a century later in 1961.\n\nWhile state high schools began opening in the early 1910s, they became more widespread about the middle of the 20th century. Before this period, students would either pass a state scholarship exam \u2013 which was introduced by the Department of Education in 1873 and covered school costs \u2013 or join the workforce. Secondary schools running at this time included grammar and Catholic schools, and those run by the Christian Brothers, which in Brisbane meant St James College, until St Joseph\u2019s College, Gregory Terrace opened in July 1875. For Gregory Terrace, classes were first taught well away from its namesake Spring Hill campus in St Stephen\u2019s Chapel, now part of the Cathedral of St Stephen, with work starting on the school\u2019s Spring Hill campus in early 1876. When that opened, it was originally a boarding school, but those students were later moved to St Joseph\u2019s Nudgee College in 1891.\n\nA St Joseph\u2019s College, Gregory Terrace cricket team in 1915. Credit: St Joseph\u2019s College, Gregory Terrace Brisbane-based author and historian Sophie Church has written several books collating the histories of schools in Brisbane and south-east Queensland, including for Gregory Terrace this year, and said she was \u201cparticularly struck\u201d with the influence the school had on its students. \u201cFrom very humble beginnings in 1875, Terrace has grown along with the city of Brisbane to become a place that is cherished by generations of its former students,\u201d Church said. Brisbane\u2019s oldest grammar school, Brisbane Grammar School, also had part of its campus annexed in 1875 to expand education opportunities for girls, with Brisbane Girls Grammar School the result.

    "text": "De Minaur\u2019s reliability is evidenced in him reaching at least the fourth round at eight of his past nine majors, the sole exception being his second-round loss to Alexander Bublik from two sets up at Roland-Garros in May. That form has helped entrench him in the top 10 ahead of an unexpected round-of-16 clash with 435th-ranked Swiss qualifier Leandro Riedi, who is the lowest-ranked player to reach this stage of a slam since 2002. Altmaier took a medical timeout during the third set for a left leg injury. Credit: Getty Images It is a remarkably good draw for de Minaur after potential seeded opponents Karen Khachanov and Francisco Cerundolo departed in the second round. De Minaur had to dig deep after looking to be in trouble as Altmaier played at a sustained high level in the first set and a half that belied his No.56 ranking.\n\nLoading The German has demonstrated in the past that he can upset top-10 stars, with Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Andrey Rublev and Matteo Berrettini among his scalps. Neither player faced a break point in the opening set, but de Minaur went 3-0 ahead in the tie-break, only for Altmaier to largely control the set from there with big striking from the baseline. Altmaier secured a one-set lead on his third opportunity. If that was not enough, de Minaur also slipped to 15-40 in the third game of the second set. He saved three break points to escape that game, but double-faulted for the fourth time in the set to also fall 15-40 behind at three-all. The Australian somehow dodged a break once more, again staving off three break points before clinching a service hold with a superb inside-out forehand winner. At that stage, Altmaier was making fewer mistakes despite his aggressive shot-making.\n\nBut in line with de Minaur\u2019s reputation, he found a way to snatch the ascendancy. Altmaier\u2019s level dipped ever so slightly, and the man known as \u201cDemon\u201d pounced. Statistically the tour\u2019s best returner, de Minaur finally earned his first break point in the eighth game. He went 5-3 up with a lunging backhand volley that followed him dragging Altmaier out of court with a terrific cross-court forehand. De Minaur\u2019s standard improved the longer the match went. Credit: AP He quickly served out the set to level the match, and never let Altmaier back into the contest, including a slick drop shot securing him an instant break to begin the third set. Kasatkina\u2019s horror start\n\nKasatkina made a horror start against Osaka, delivering three double faults in her opening service game and eight in the first set as the Japanese superstar surged to a dominant one-set advantage in 23 minutes without conceding a game. But Kasatkina, who gained permanent residency in Australia in March, warned pre-match she would not give in. She had never taken a set off Osaka in their previous two meetings, but broke her rival three times to start the second set as she raced to a 4-1 lead in a wild swing of momentum. However, another twist was still to come. Daria Kasatkina had some great moments against Naomi Osaka, but eventually lost in three sets. Credit: AP With Kasatkina\u2019s serve continuing to be shaky, Osaka blasted her way back into the set and reeled off three straight games to draw level.\n\nJust as Osaka seemed poised to charge to a straight-sets win, she sprayed a forehand to hand over a fourth break for the set. Kasatkina blew consecutive set points before bringing up a third with a rare ace, then produced a second excellent serve that did not come back. But for all Kasatkina\u2019s doggedness, Osaka\u2019s firepower proved too much. The 2018 and 2020 US Open champion flayed 37 winners to the Australian\u2019s 15 by match\u2019s end, including 15 in the third set as she punched holes in Kasatkina\u2019s defence. She broke for 3-1 and never relented. Osaka next meets 2024 winner Coco Gauff in a blockbuster clash for a quarter-final spot at this year\u2019s tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really long journey, but I\u2019m glad to be here now,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough playing an American here \u2026 but I also see [Gauff] as a little sister, so it\u2019s really cool to be playing her here again.\u201d",

Over the course of 40 in-depth interviews with people in this age bracket from around the nation, an overwhelming sense of despondency and disappointment has emerged in an age group which should, by rights, be basking in the wide horizons of opportunity youth presents. Instead, they talked about feeling trapped. Like they\u2019re doing everything right but just can\u2019t get ahead.\n\nThe Insurance Council of Australia, defending its members who sell Lenders Mortgage Insurance , released modelling by Lateral Economics showing the scheme would push property prices up by 3.5 to 6.6 per cent a year, and by as much as 9.9 per cent in the lower-priced segments where first-home buyers are most active. That\u2019s double the supposed saving of skipping insurance.\n\nIt was a bad week for Band-Aids. Inflation jumped more than expected because households in Sydney and Melbourne didn\u2019t receive their quarterly government energy payments in time to offset rising bills. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s much-touted first-home buyer scheme \u2013 letting buyers enter the market with just a five per cent deposit while the government goes guarantor \u2013 was exposed as worse than nothing.\n\nA few mentioned that the government\u2019s policy of reducing HECS debt by 20 per cent helped \u201ca bit\u201d. Others mentioned that they realised they were fortunate to get \u201cthe dole\u201d, as one referred to welfare payments, or a disability pension. They are leaning on the bannister of government support, but the direction of travel is down.\n\nLoading\n\nThe treasurer\u2019s recent economic roundtable emerged with a consensus that something needs to be done to ensure intergenerational equity. So far, what this seems to mean in practice is changing the concessional treatment of superannuation so that older Australians pay more tax on the money they have saved. What it ignores is that the reason older people pay less tax and have access to concessions on a range of services is because they are assumed to be at the end of their earning potential \u2013 what they have is all there will be. Young people, on the other hand, are at the beginning of their trajectory. The real shift isn\u2019t in easing retirees\u2019 circumstances \u2013 it\u2019s in the collapse of opportunities for the young.\n\nThe prompts in my qualitative research were structured to ask broad questions which would allow respondents to take the lead rather than questioning them on pre-conceived ideas of what might matter. The aspirations of those I interviewed were modest and familiar: financial stability, a home, a secure or fulfilling job, strong family and social ties. Some respondents also mentioned travelling the world, helping others, reaching athletic achievement or pursuing entrepreneurial ventures. Not unrealistic hopes, for the most part. But with only a couple of exceptions, almost all had adjusted their aspirations downward well before they reached the age of 30, due to rising living costs, challenges in the jobs market, a perceived lack of government support or personal and family circumstances.\n\nWhat is invisible to most is that many of the Band-Aid measures are bandages holding them back. Like the reduced deposit and insurance scheme which will make it harder to get into the housing market. Or the HECS debt reduction which offers a little relief today by borrowing from them tomorrow, while tacitly endorsing an ongoing culture of credentialism.",

So he looked in another direction in the seventh minute of time added on at the end of another Old Trafford epic, when Bruno Fernandes stepped up to dispatch the deciding goal in a game that Manchester United had to win.\n\nWere they ever really assured of doing so? Not, it seemed, even after Fernandes had scored that penalty to secure the 3-2 win over Burnley. Right to the end the tension remained in a game in which United had twice thrown away a lead and ultimately required a penalty given on a VAR review for their winner. It was done so on the finest of margins \u2013 referee Sam Barrott sent to the VAR monitor to examine a tug on the shirt of Amad Diallo by Jaidon Anthony that was at the very least open to dispute.\n\nThrough it all, Amorim stalked the touchline like a man who might do or say anything. This is a manager under extraordinary pressure and it would be fair to say that he does little to disguise that. Just three games into the Premier League season, he dropped the first-choice goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana and also decided his new centre-forward Benjamin Sesko was not yet ready to start. There must have been moments when it felt that nothing works, although United did eventually stumble over the line.",

    "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nRare earths are a group of 17 metallic elements that power modern technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom TVs to smartphones, medical devices, satellites, even weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd they're crucial too for the green energy transition. Solar and wind energy and electric vehicles all depend on rare earth elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Vlado Vivoda from the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland says despite the name, they're not actually scarce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So a lot of them are not actually rare, but they're hard to mine and even harder to separate and process safely. So that's what makes them geopolitically important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRare earths are tightly bound together with other elements in nature and so, separating them is a complex process often involving at least 50 stages.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch operations are expensive, labour-intensive and often environmentally damaging.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so most countries have left the work to China, which Dr Vivoda says emerged as a key player in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China appeared as the ideal candidate to take in some of that industry, to do it at home with a bit more lax environmental regulations. And it was the cheapest place to do all this. Plus China had some of the largest reserves as well of rare earths.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChina now controls the majority of the rare earths supply chain, accounting for around 70 percent of mining and 90 percent processing, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, China imposed restrictions on the export of a range of critical rare earths\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move, which was in retaliation to US President Donald's Trump's sweeping tariffs - exposes just how reliant the world is on these minerals.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Australia, which has some of the richest deposits in the world, is stepping in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we do have a lot of rare earths reserves as well in Australia and it's a matter of bringing all those reserves to production. Australia is a traditional resource economy. Our biggest commodities for some time have been coal, iron ore, L-N-G and some other minerals. Rare earths have been minuscule along with a lot of other critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and so on. I think a lot of potential there for Australia as well to get involved.\"\n\n\n\n",

Source: SBS News \"Gold price has gone up. It's gone up about 40 per cent in the last 12 months. In 2025, from January to June it's gone up about 20 per cent.

It's very much a part of their culture, their heritage, and certainly their belief as far as a store of value.\"\n\n\n\nJewellery for Diwali, special events\n\nHolding a baby about eight or nine months old with a mop of thick dark hair, Ajay and his partner are shopping for jewellery in Harris Park in Sydney, at one of several shops in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a ritual for us to be honest on festivals and occasions. And a kid is born, we buy gold Diwali at the Festival of Lights. We buy gold and we put that in for temple as well. For worshipping as well. Yeah, it's quite a product.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe store owner Akshaj Sharma estimates that about 90 per cent of its customers are from South Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Nitika Garg says the skyrocketing price of gold is putting a lot of pressure on India's middle class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have family and friends in India, there is still the expectation if it's a marriage of your daughter or your son, you are expected to make jewellery for them or give jewellery to the other party,\" she says.\n\n\n\nAbout 90 per cent of Akshaj Sharma's customers are from South Asia.

And generally also their cost of living has gotten people to sell more as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People can't afford to live, so they just start selling off all jewellery that they have from generations ago.

So yeah, I sold that about six months ago,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe got just under $10,000 for it.\n\n\n\nEmotionally I did have to think about it a couple of days on and off over a short period of time, but I wasn't wearing, it was sitting in the drawer and yeah, I needed the money, so I ended up getting rid of it\n\nVince says that, in Turkish culture, gold remains an important gift, particularly at weddings and births.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also considered a valuable asset \u2014 a kind of backup plan in hard times.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt weddings guests are also expected give gold coins or jewellery as wedding gifts.\n\n\n\n\n\nVince says that can be too much for some people \u2014 who may choose to avoid these celebrations all together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're going through hardship and they make up some kind of excuse to not turn up.\"\n\n\n\nGold recycling the way of the future\n\nGeorgakopoulos is seeing an increase in people recycling old jewellery rather than purchasing something new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of buying a new piece outright, they're bringing in their heirloom jewellery. So stuff they've had passed down some, they've had it for years and they're either using their gold, so they're incorporating the gold into something new.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Gold Council says mine production accounts for the largest part of global gold supply \u2014 typically, 75 per cent each year with the shortfall made up from recycling.\n\n\n\nAmid the cost of living crisis, many are opting to sell heirloom gold jewellery. Source: SBS News Earthworks \u2014 a United States environmental group \u2014 says there are more than 2,000 major mining companies in the world in addition to countless small artisinal mining sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group says these mines are a major source of pollution with few taking steps to avoid further environmental damage from gold mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious studies say that gold recycling could meet the world's current gold needs with less need to resort to mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at Oxford University say about one-quarter of annual gold demand is already supplied through recycling and could be increased with strategies such as blending with other metals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also say moves for more responsible and sustainable gold extraction methods should be a priority for mining companies.\n\n\n\n",

And they wear the thick jewellery with the thick pendants and that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe love of gold dates back a long way.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 5,000 BC the Egyptians used gold found in the bed of the Nile River for adornment, while it also featured heavily in ancient European, Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question, though, is why do humans in almost every part of the world love this shiny metal so much?\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Nitika Garg is a researcher in consumer behaviour at UNSW in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's funny, right? So it's obviously cultural and traditional, how we have attached value to gold, not in just in terms of the actual value of the asset, but in terms of emotional value where it's considered from everything from good luck to a symbolism of wishing the best to your close family and friends on occasion. And there's also research that humans have over time evolved to sort of get attracted towards jewels and gold, which just because it gives them that assurance, it's an asset, it's a resource. And just with water, food, these assets have over time evolved to hold meaning for us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what's behind the price rise?\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say geopolitical factors, global unrest and fears of inflation fanned by the threat posed by US President Donald Trump's tariffs are just some of the reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Gold Council says central banks are also buying up gold at eye-watering rates, and investors tend to see it as a safe bet in difficult times.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Council says in 2024, jewellery accounted for about 50 per cent of total demand, central bank reserves around 20 per cent, electronics and Industrial around 7 per cent, medical and dental about 1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile demand for jewellery has dropped due to the price, it still retains strong cultural value in many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter McGuire is the CEO Australia for Trading.Com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"First off, let's look at Asia and that corridor from really Australia all the way up to Japan and you've got China in there and the likes of Malaysia. We all understand that the depth of those countries from a population standpoint and gold has been a source of value or a source of family value for literally millennium. And that holding of gold has been one of dowries or placing under beds or weddings or festivals that you have throughout your year. Christening anything like that is very much a gift that someone would gift some form of gold to someone. Then you roll it across to the likes of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, and you've really captured again the best part of probably 2 billion people. It's a big store of value, certainly in the likes of India. It's very much a part of their culture, their heritage, and certainly their belief as far as a store of value.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a ritual for us to be honest on festivals and occasions. And a kid is born, we buy gold Diwali at the Festival of Lights. We buy gold and we put that in for temple as well. For worshipping as well. Yeah, it's quite a product.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHolding a baby about eight or nine months old with a mop of thick dark hair, Ajay and his partner are shopping for jewellery in Sydney's Harris Park.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's one of a couple of jewellery shops in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe owner of the shop estimates that about 90 per cent of its customers are from countries in South Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshaj Sharma runs Akshara Jewellery with his dad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Generally it's necklace sets and bangles, pretty heavy, heavy stuff. So the bride side will gift the groom. The groom side will gift the bride. They'll obviously gift the rings as well. They'll give some rings. Or for the bride it'll be necklace sets and bangles. And they're generally pretty heavy so that they last a very long time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris Park in Western Sydney is affectionately known as Little India; that's because around 45 per cent of its population was born in India, according to the 2021 Census.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suburb is lined with grocery shops, restaurants, clothing shops and jewellery shops.\n\n\n\n\n\n22 carat gold reigns supreme here - the preferred choice for many people from South Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes it a pricey gift in today's gold market - although that hasn't stopped Ashima, who has just bought her fiance a gift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In our culture If I give him something made of gold, I don't have to decide anything else. It's like a prestigious issue also. And it's like a property value also, like an investment. So he would not say, why did you spend that? Because he would love it. I got him a locket. It has the name of my state. Originally I come from Punjab, so it was a locket with the name of Punjab initialled it, and it's our mother tongue. It's written in Punjabi, not in the English language. So that's what I thought, that he would love it and he would also have an emotional connect with that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Nitika Garg says consumer behaviour and culture are often linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most of southeastern cultures in particular have high value on this, and if you look at their tradition, especially around marriage or birth of a child, there will be significant investment or exchange of gold, whether it's in terms of jewelry or bullion. And I obviously know about India from personal experience, but also I know friends from Vietnam, Thailand, everywhere, even China, it is a big deal in terms of personal and social exchanges.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she adds the skyrocketing price of gold is putting a lot of pressure on India's middle class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have obviously family and friends in India, there is still the expectation if it's a marriage of your daughter or your son, you are expected to make jewellery for them or give jewellery to the other party. So there is pressure, and it is obviously hurting the middle class more because they don't have quite the give, the very poor and the very rich options are either too many or rarely no options. But the middle class, at least in India, I can see they're hurting a little bit because it changes your dynamics, how much you could give with the same amount of money. And now gold is so expensive, it's like literally you can't touch it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshaj Sharma says there has been an increase in the number of people coming into the shop to sell rather than buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have jewellery from 10, 20 years ago, they still sell to us or from their grandparents and stuff that have passed away. And generally also their cost of living has gotten people to sell more as well. People can't afford to live, so they just start selling off all jewelry that they have from generations ago. We get a lot of that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVince is an Australian of Turkish ancestry - another culture that values gold as a gift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had a thick chain that I bought when I was a bit younger but I was hanging on to, it was about a hundred grams so it was a bit of a medium-sized chain. So yeah, I sold that about six months ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe got just under $10,000 for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Emotionally I did have to think about it a couple of days on and off over a short period of time, but I wasn't wearing, it was sitting in the drawer and yeah, I needed the money so I ended up getting rid of it. Gave some to my kids, got some stuff fixed around the house, spent some, ate some and it's gone. Yeah, it's pretty much gone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVince says in Turkish culture gold remains a important gift, particularly at weddings and births.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also considered a valuable asset - a backup plan in hard times.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt weddings guests are also expected give gold coins or jewellery as wedding gifts.\n\n\n\n\n\nVince says that can be too much for some people who may choose to avoid these celebrations all together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And people don't turn up to weddings because of that kind of pressure. So they get invited and they make an excuse because they're going through hardship and they make up some kind of excuse to not turn up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDanny Georgakopoulos is seeing an increase in people recycling old jewellery rather than purchasing something new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of buying a new piece outright, they're bringing in their heirloom jewellery. So stuff they've had passed down some, they've had it for years and they're either using their gold, so they're incorporating the gold into something new, which is nice because if you're sentimental jewellery, you're still using the same jewellery that has been passed down from a loved one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Gold Council says mine production accounts for the largest part of global gold supply \u2013 typically, 75 per cent each year with the shortfall made up from recycling.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthworks, a United States environment group, says there are more than 2,000 major mining companies in the world in addition to countless small artisanal mining sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group says these mines are a major source of pollution with few taking steps to avoid further environmental damage from gold mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious studies say gold recycling could meet the world's current gold needs with less need to resort to mining.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at Oxford University say about one-quarter of annual gold demand is already supplied through recycling and could be increased with strategies such as blending with other metals.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government has announced a $30 million initiative to boost the number of vocational education trainers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as the federal government launched National Skills Week to promote options for lifelong learning for Australians amid ongoing skill shortages.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those from migrant and refugee communities, the upskilling opportunity is being viewed as an exciting new chapter in their life in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter moving from Afghanistan to Australia, Fatima Sultanzi was looking for a way to keep fuelling her passion and love for fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe had studied fashion design in Afghanistan - and was open to upskilling.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when her friends told her about the fashion design course at TAFE New South Wales in collaboration with local fashion brand, The Social Outfit, she signed up immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I learned many things here in The Social Outfit. Different kinds of things, like (learning how to make) suits, coats, T-shirts, pants, and (using) machine. Every (sewing) machine, I can use it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Ms Sultanzi made a suit for the Governor-General of Australia Sam Mostyn, who has also worn clothing from the brand during her swearing-in ceremony last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy Low is the chief executive of the brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough the partnership with TAFE New South Wales in the past decade, her brand has supported and upskilled over 450 migrant women interested in Australia's fashion industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we are able to deliver in that partnership with TAFE here is the women who may be comfortable sewing on a domestic machine, will have their first experience under supervision with the industrial sewing machine. And in gaining both technical skills, they are also really experiencing what it might be like to work as a machinist, and to begin a career in that industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story of Ms Sultanzi and The Social Outfit is one that the federal government wants to see more, as they announce more investments in the country's vocational education training sector - or VET sector - during its launch of the 2025 National Skills Week (25-31 August).\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year's theme was 'VET as a game changer'. This year, it is 'Exploring All the Options'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe emphasis on the different and varied opportunities for all Australians to access training and upskilling, regardless of their location.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the National Press Club, the Minister for Skills and Training Andrew Giles says since fee-free TAFE places became available in 2023, there has been over 650,000 enrollments across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Free TAFE is breaking down cost barriers and de-stigmatising the idea that learning is only for the young. More than 125,000 Australians aged 45 and over have enrolled.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Giles used his National Press Club speech to announce a $30 million investment in the VET trainer workforce, aiming at increasing the number of electrical and construction VET teachers, and First Nations VET teachers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also wants to see a sustainable skill training system, backed by both educational institutions and industries, to support the idea of lifelong learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a concept that knits together how we should be thinking about supporting people to navigate the changing world - on their terms. Moving beyond the narrow sense of equipping a person to perform a role. Because jobs are changing and we now know people can now expect to move between industries, not simply between employers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Wexham is th e chief executive and chair of National Skills Week.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says lifelong learning is key - and will be needed more than ever, as developments like AI's impact on work and workers drive demand for upskilling and reskilling.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wexham says he also hopes there will be major improvements in the perception of the value of the VET sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we need to do, and what the government need to do, we need to get those messages across, and the story across, of the success of people coming out of vocational education and what they've been able to do. I mean to go to TAFE isn't a failure. It's a success story.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Wexham also says VET can be helpful for the settlement of refugees and migrants - and that's the exact story of Samia Salhaz.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter being a chef in Syria for 20 years, Ms Salhaz moved to Australia in 2022, and began a traineeship with the Bread and Butter Project, a social enterprise that offers baking training to refugee women, in partnership with TAFE New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter graduation, she secured a job with the enterprise to train other women.\n\n\n\n",

The energy in the arena only properly heats up once Cabello returns to the tracks most of her fans fell in love with her for \u2013 the upbeat Latin flare of Bam Bam and the sultry salsa-inspired sound of Havana. Here, the crowd heaves with excitement, everyone swaying their hips in almost perfect unison. Camila Cabello hasn\u2019t performed in Australia since opening for Taylor Swift during the Reputation Tour. Credit: Richard Clifford It\u2019s during these moments, when Cabello essentially has the crowd eating from her hand, that she herself appears to have the most fun. During the nu-disco pop track Quiet, she even implores the audience to go completely silent \u2013 a rare feat for an arena gig \u2013 before ramping their cheers up again at her own command. \u201cI\u2019ve stuffed my face with Tim Tams. I\u2019ve even done a Tim Tam slam. I hope we return to Australia. We flew our butts all the way over here, and you\u2019ve been the best crowd ever. You\u2019ve been better than the best \u2013 you\u2019ve been supersonic,\u201d Cabello says, before seamlessly launching into I Luv It.\n\nCabello has said her new era is about embracing transformation and change. Yet, the best parts of her tour are when she reverts to the very sound that earned her multiple Grammy nominations back in 2019. Ultimately, Cabello has more sway than swagger, but perhaps we need to accept she\u2019ll \u201cnever be the same\u201d as before.\n\nReviewed by Nell Geraets JAZZ\n\nPaul Grabowsky and Michelle Nicolle | Noir \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nPrimrose Potter Salon, Melbourne Recital Centre, August 30 It\u2019s hard to believe that Paul Grabowsky and Michelle Nicolle \u2013 both peerless artists and long-time luminaries of the Australian jazz scene \u2013 have never collaborated until now. Pianist Paul Grabowsky Credit: Alice Healy Yet Noir, their newly released album, marks their first musical outing together. Saturday\u2019s concert (the first of two sold-out Melbourne shows) served as the official album launch, and the intimacy of the Recital Centre Salon made it the perfect setting for this repertoire.\n\nAs the title suggests, Noir luxuriates in darkness with songs of sadness and yearning, dashed dreams and broken hearts. Most of the songs are well-known, but stripped of their glossy patina to expose the honesty and fragility of the emotions they express. On stage, Nicolle exudes a natural warmth and positivity that bubbles up whenever she chats to the audience. But in this setting, as soon as Grabowsky\u2019s hands touched the keys \u2013 setting the scene with quietly brooding introductions \u2013 Nicolle cloaked herself in the shadows of each song and its characters, making us believe these stories were her own. Jazz singer Michelle Nicolle. Credit: Giuseppe Dante Sapienza In classic film noir, the woman is often a femme fatale, her deceitful intent hidden under a seductive surface. Nicolle is the opposite, willing to unmask and reveal the inner workings of a tender heart. Her exquisite vibrato suggested a trembling vulnerability on Michel Legrand\u2019s I Will Wait For You, as Grabowsky\u2019s delicate accompaniment underlined the bittersweet beauty of the lyrics. Heartbreak Hotel \u2013 forever associated with Elvis\u2019 sensual swagger \u2013 was reharmonised to accentuate the melancholy beneath the bluesy exterior, while I\u2019m a Fool to Want You illuminated the darkness with flecks of light, courtesy of a Latin-tinged lilt and gently playful extemporisations on the melody.\n\nGrabowsky\u2019s own Rainbow Cake (co-written with Vince Jones) fitted perfectly into this repertoire with its mood of wistful nostalgia, as did Nicolle\u2019s disarmingly poignant One Beer. Yes, it was an hour of sad songs, but these superb artists \u2013 who understand the value of sincerity and understatement \u2013 made it a pleasure to escape into the shadows.\n\nReviewed by Jessica Nicholas DANCE\n\nScenarios and Copy of the Copy \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDancehouse, Carlton, until August 30 Both works currently showing at Dancehouse circle around problems of replication and imitation. These are enduring fascinations for choreographers but what makes this evening interesting is the contrast: one work meditates on sameness, while the other insists on difference. Scenarios is playful but also intimate. Credit: Takeshi Kondo\n\nScenarios, created and performed by Benjamin Hurley and Scott Elstermann, plays like a queer duet of self-fascination. Each performs as if the other were a mirror, a copy with no original, doubling gestures until resemblance tips into a kind of dreamy hallucination. Their shared identity is really a shared sensibility. A kind of rococo dandyism in duplicate. Movements are upright, measured and immaculately shaped. It\u2019s disciplined dancing, with obsessively worked symmetries, synchronicities and long phrases that develop with tricky vocalisations. Copy of the Copy is interested in the way dance passes from body to body, teacher to pupil. Credit: Tiffany Garvie They cycle through many images or scenarios. A well-chosen text hints at the thrill of seeing yourself as another, while a darker vignette evokes the doppelg\u00e4nger bent on self-annihilation. Yet the mood remains playful \u2013 even a little screwy \u2013 throughout these transformations. It\u2019s cute but also intimate. In the end, the audience itself becomes a reflective medium, placed before the twins like one of the mirrors that organise the space, as if their doubled identities require us to be the final surface in which their resemblance is registered.\n\nPriya Srinivasan, by contrast, in Copy of the Copy, is less concerned with uncanny reflections than with the way dance passes from body to body, teacher to pupil. In that transfer, copies are never exact: something is lost and something else is gained. Her work is resolutely theatrical, combining dance, video, audience interaction and even a little cooking. The registers are also multiple \u2013 comic, earnest, scholarly, confessional \u2013 and they continually shift. The effect is of a layered inquiry, staging transmission itself as a complex, unstable process. Loading Central to the performance is Srinivasan\u2019s own dance lineage: her teachers and the teachers who taught them. As the work culminates, however, we get a more expansive mapping of connections, a deliberately overwhelming series of names stretching from the present to the late eighteenth century, crisscrossing continents, empires and colonies. As the names pile up, distinctions blur: which connections were fleeting encounters and which were nurtured over many years? Yes, we get a sense of the density of intercultural traffic, but the concept of the copy becomes a little vague and underdefined.",

She shares her studio with several toy houses, including one built by her husband\u2019s grandfather that she carefully renovated over two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did a cafe dollhouse, a tree dollhouse, a clock dollhouse. It\u2019s gotten a little bit out of hand.\u201d She now offers a popular online course in making dollhouses, alongside embroidery and furniture upcycling courses. These are more than downloadable PDFs: they include between 40 and 50 detailed videos showing the techniques required to make the chosen project. Next on the to-do list are courses on mosaics and sewing. \u201cIt just comes down to the projects people are asking the most questions about,\u201d she explains. A kerbside collection \u2018addict\u2019 Living in Brisbane has proved a valuable inspiration for Vanderzeil and her projects, with the city\u2019s subtropical elements bleeding into her work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always thinking about the design of my home, which is cottage-y and a little bit mid-century, when I\u2019m thinking about the projects that I do,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople love the look and the feel of Brisbane\u2019s lifestyle, so I channel that into the projects.\u201d Loading One element that\u2019s hard for her global audience to replicate, however, is the city\u2019s kerbside collection program. Brisbane City Council\u2019s annual trash clean-out has become an invaluable resource for Vanderzeil \u2013 and one she encourages crafty Brisbane residents to make the most of. \u201cI am addicted to kerbside collection. I think we\u2019re quite lucky in Brisbane. \u201cIt\u2019s also legal in Brisbane to go and pick up things that you think will look good in your space or that you can transform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always so amazing to see what\u2019s out there ... more often than not, they\u2019re pieces that just need a little bit of love and a little bit of elbow grease to give them a whole new life.\u201d For those eager to trawl through suburbs on the hunt for a kerbside gem, Vanderzeil\u2019s advice is simple. You can\u2019t go wrong with a good-quality timber piece of furniture; it might just need to be sanded back and stained. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to look perfect to have a lot of potential because you can always do so much to a piece.\u201d \u2018Start really small\u2019 Vanderzeil\u2019s studio is filled with gadgets, paint samples and brushes, but she says you don\u2019t need a stocked toolkit to get started. \u201cJust start really small,\u201d she advises. \u201cStart with a project, work out what you need for that project, and begin gathering your toolkit that way \u2013 just project by project.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

The inner-south school lost one of its oldest structures \u2013 a 120-year-old fig tree \u2013 in 2014, which former principal and current 150th anniversary committee chair Judy Thompson said had been a key part of the school\u2019s identity. Former West End State School long-time teacher Mary Skarparis and former principal Judy Thompson hold an image of the fig tree that stood for more than a century on the site. Credit: Catherine Strohfeldt \u201cIt became a symbol of the strong roots and traditions, and just that protection, that comfort, and that welcome,\u201d she said. The site of the tree is now a meeting place in the centre of the campus, and the school\u2019s current emblem and new song feature the tree.\n\nThompson also worked as a principal of Kelvin Grove State College from 1999 to 2008, organising the school\u2019s 125th celebration in 2000. \u201cWhen Kelvin Grove started, [it] started down the bottom of the hill at Newmarket Road as a provisional school. Then the government, in the 1870s, set aside 108 acres of land on that hill from Kelvin Grove Road all the way down and called it Victoria Park,\u201d Thompson said. Kelvin Grove State Provisional School, around 1900. Credit: Kelvin Grove State College \u201cThat area was gazetted in the 1870s for education and sport.\u201d The school\u2019s current campus, abutting QUT, is the site of the original Kelvin Grove Road Provisional State School. Kelvin Grove State High School was opened almost a century later in 1961.\n\nWhile state high schools began opening in the early 1910s, they became more widespread about the middle of the 20th century. Before this period, students would either pass a state scholarship exam \u2013 which was introduced by the Department of Education in 1873 and covered school costs \u2013 or join the workforce. Secondary schools running at this time included grammar and Catholic schools, and those run by the Christian Brothers, which in Brisbane meant St James College, until St Joseph\u2019s College, Gregory Terrace opened in July 1875. For Gregory Terrace, classes were first taught well away from its namesake Spring Hill campus in St Stephen\u2019s Chapel, now part of the Cathedral of St Stephen, with work starting on the school\u2019s Spring Hill campus in early 1876. When that opened, it was originally a boarding school, but those students were later moved to St Joseph\u2019s Nudgee College in 1891.\n\nA St Joseph\u2019s College, Gregory Terrace cricket team in 1915. Credit: St Joseph\u2019s College, Gregory Terrace Brisbane-based author and historian Sophie Church has written several books collating the histories of schools in Brisbane and south-east Queensland, including for Gregory Terrace this year, and said she was \u201cparticularly struck\u201d with the influence the school had on its students. \u201cFrom very humble beginnings in 1875, Terrace has grown along with the city of Brisbane to become a place that is cherished by generations of its former students,\u201d Church said. Brisbane\u2019s oldest grammar school, Brisbane Grammar School, also had part of its campus annexed in 1875 to expand education opportunities for girls, with Brisbane Girls Grammar School the result.

    "text": "De Minaur\u2019s reliability is evidenced in him reaching at least the fourth round at eight of his past nine majors, the sole exception being his second-round loss to Alexander Bublik from two sets up at Roland-Garros in May. That form has helped entrench him in the top 10 ahead of an unexpected round-of-16 clash with 435th-ranked Swiss qualifier Leandro Riedi, who is the lowest-ranked player to reach this stage of a slam since 2002. Altmaier took a medical timeout during the third set for a left leg injury. Credit: Getty Images It is a remarkably good draw for de Minaur after potential seeded opponents Karen Khachanov and Francisco Cerundolo departed in the second round. De Minaur had to dig deep after looking to be in trouble as Altmaier played at a sustained high level in the first set and a half that belied his No.56 ranking.\n\nLoading The German has demonstrated in the past that he can upset top-10 stars, with Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Andrey Rublev and Matteo Berrettini among his scalps. Neither player faced a break point in the opening set, but de Minaur went 3-0 ahead in the tie-break, only for Altmaier to largely control the set from there with big striking from the baseline. Altmaier secured a one-set lead on his third opportunity. If that was not enough, de Minaur also slipped to 15-40 in the third game of the second set. He saved three break points to escape that game, but double-faulted for the fourth time in the set to also fall 15-40 behind at three-all. The Australian somehow dodged a break once more, again staving off three break points before clinching a service hold with a superb inside-out forehand winner. At that stage, Altmaier was making fewer mistakes despite his aggressive shot-making.\n\nBut in line with de Minaur\u2019s reputation, he found a way to snatch the ascendancy. Altmaier\u2019s level dipped ever so slightly, and the man known as \u201cDemon\u201d pounced. Statistically the tour\u2019s best returner, de Minaur finally earned his first break point in the eighth game. He went 5-3 up with a lunging backhand volley that followed him dragging Altmaier out of court with a terrific cross-court forehand. De Minaur\u2019s standard improved the longer the match went. Credit: AP He quickly served out the set to level the match, and never let Altmaier back into the contest, including a slick drop shot securing him an instant break to begin the third set. Kasatkina\u2019s horror start\n\nKasatkina made a horror start against Osaka, delivering three double faults in her opening service game and eight in the first set as the Japanese superstar surged to a dominant one-set advantage in 23 minutes without conceding a game. But Kasatkina, who gained permanent residency in Australia in March, warned pre-match she would not give in. She had never taken a set off Osaka in their previous two meetings, but broke her rival three times to start the second set as she raced to a 4-1 lead in a wild swing of momentum. However, another twist was still to come. Daria Kasatkina had some great moments against Naomi Osaka, but eventually lost in three sets. Credit: AP With Kasatkina\u2019s serve continuing to be shaky, Osaka blasted her way back into the set and reeled off three straight games to draw level.\n\nJust as Osaka seemed poised to charge to a straight-sets win, she sprayed a forehand to hand over a fourth break for the set. Kasatkina blew consecutive set points before bringing up a third with a rare ace, then produced a second excellent serve that did not come back. But for all Kasatkina\u2019s doggedness, Osaka\u2019s firepower proved too much. The 2018 and 2020 US Open champion flayed 37 winners to the Australian\u2019s 15 by match\u2019s end, including 15 in the third set as she punched holes in Kasatkina\u2019s defence. She broke for 3-1 and never relented. Osaka next meets 2024 winner Coco Gauff in a blockbuster clash for a quarter-final spot at this year\u2019s tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really long journey, but I\u2019m glad to be here now,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough playing an American here \u2026 but I also see [Gauff] as a little sister, so it\u2019s really cool to be playing her here again.\u201d",

    "text": "Over the last couple of weeks, I have been experimenting with conversational AI interviewing technology to gauge the aspirations of Australians 18 to 30 years old and the barriers they believe are holding them back. Over the course of 40 in-depth interviews with people in this age bracket from around the nation, an overwhelming sense of despondency and disappointment has emerged in an age group which should, by rights, be basking in the wide horizons of opportunity youth presents. Instead, they talked about feeling trapped. Like they\u2019re doing everything right but just can\u2019t get ahead.\n\nThe Insurance Council of Australia, defending its members who sell Lenders Mortgage Insurance , released modelling by Lateral Economics showing the scheme would push property prices up by 3.5 to 6.6 per cent a year, and by as much as 9.9 per cent in the lower-priced segments where first-home buyers are most active. That\u2019s double the supposed saving of skipping insurance.\n\nIt was a bad week for Band-Aids. Inflation jumped more than expected because households in Sydney and Melbourne didn\u2019t receive their quarterly government energy payments in time to offset rising bills. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s much-touted first-home buyer scheme \u2013 letting buyers enter the market with just a five per cent deposit while the government goes guarantor \u2013 was exposed as worse than nothing.\n\nA few mentioned that the government\u2019s policy of reducing HECS debt by 20 per cent helped \u201ca bit\u201d. Others mentioned that they realised they were fortunate to get \u201cthe dole\u201d, as one referred to welfare payments, or a disability pension. They are leaning on the bannister of government support, but the direction of travel is down.\n\nLoading\n\nThe treasurer\u2019s recent economic roundtable emerged with a consensus that something needs to be done to ensure intergenerational equity. So far, what this seems to mean in practice is changing the concessional treatment of superannuation so that older Australians pay more tax on the money they have saved. What it ignores is that the reason older people pay less tax and have access to concessions on a range of services is because they are assumed to be at the end of their earning potential \u2013 what they have is all there will be. Young people, on the other hand, are at the beginning of their trajectory. The real shift isn\u2019t in easing retirees\u2019 circumstances \u2013 it\u2019s in the collapse of opportunities for the young.\n\nThe prompts in my qualitative research were structured to ask broad questions which would allow respondents to take the lead rather than questioning them on pre-conceived ideas of what might matter. The aspirations of those I interviewed were modest and familiar: financial stability, a home, a secure or fulfilling job, strong family and social ties. Some respondents also mentioned travelling the world, helping others, reaching athletic achievement or pursuing entrepreneurial ventures. Not unrealistic hopes, for the most part. But with only a couple of exceptions, almost all had adjusted their aspirations downward well before they reached the age of 30, due to rising living costs, challenges in the jobs market, a perceived lack of government support or personal and family circumstances.\n\nWhat is invisible to most is that many of the Band-Aid measures are bandages holding them back. Like the reduced deposit and insurance scheme which will make it harder to get into the housing market. Or the HECS debt reduction which offers a little relief today by borrowing from them tomorrow, while tacitly endorsing an ongoing culture of credentialism.",

    "text": "Even sat back in his chair, with his feet resting on the wall that fronts the Old Trafford coaches\u2019 benches, Ruben Amorim still looked like the tensest man in the stadium as matters came to a head in injury time.\n\nAs per convention, Amorim does not watch his players take penalties and now, even in the white-heat of these post-Grimsby Town days at Old Trafford, it seems that is not going to change. So he looked in another direction in the seventh minute of time added on at the end of another Old Trafford epic, when Bruno Fernandes stepped up to dispatch the deciding goal in a game that Manchester United had to win.\n\nWere they ever really assured of doing so? Not, it seemed, even after Fernandes had scored that penalty to secure the 3-2 win over Burnley. Right to the end the tension remained in a game in which United had twice thrown away a lead and ultimately required a penalty given on a VAR review for their winner. It was done so on the finest of margins \u2013 referee Sam Barrott sent to the VAR monitor to examine a tug on the shirt of Amad Diallo by Jaidon Anthony that was at the very least open to dispute.\n\nThrough it all, Amorim stalked the touchline like a man who might do or say anything. This is a manager under extraordinary pressure and it would be fair to say that he does little to disguise that. Just three games into the Premier League season, he dropped the first-choice goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana and also decided his new centre-forward Benjamin Sesko was not yet ready to start. There must have been moments when it felt that nothing works, although United did eventually stumble over the line.",
