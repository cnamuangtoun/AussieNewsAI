    "text": "When Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican in early May, he took with him, by way of gift for the new Catholic Church head, a painting by Ngarrindjeri artist Amanda Westley.\n\n\"I wonder if the Pope knew that we're 36 per cent of the prison population when he received that painting,\" Barkindji artist Kent Morris says.\n\nI've driven though a miserable autumn day in Melbourne to Heide Gallery in the city's leafy eastern suburbs to meet Morris, the curator and director of the First Nations-led not-for-profit organisation, The Torch project.\n\nAs we chat, he's walking me through his latest curation, the incredible exhibition Blak In-Justice: Incarceration and Resilience.\n\n\"Our artwork and culture is somehow revered on the international stage and high enough for an exchange at that level, but yet, we're the most incarcerated people on the planet.\"\n\nNgarrindjeri artist Trevor Nickolls' paintings \"were among the first to portray the harsh realities of contemporary life from an Aboriginal perspective\", AGSA curator Nici Cumpston writes. (Supplied: Heidi Museum of Modern Art)\n\nSince the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Indigenous incarceration rates have more than doubled, and deaths in custody have continued to rise.\n\n\"I think generally, as a nation, it's just seen as something that's, well, it is what it is,\" Morris says.\n\n\"It's a huge stain on this nation.\"\n\nExhibition 'a call to action'\n\nMorris is warm, smiles easily. But it's clear this exhibition is close to his heart.\n\nWhen I ask him what's inspired it, his response is: \"Sheer frustration.\"\n\nMorris says \"we've created for ourselves\" \u2014 but White Australia's support is crucial. (Supplied: Heidi Museum of Modern Art/Tina Baum)\n\nMorris is incensed by the over-representation of Indigenous people in our legal system.\n\nBut, he adds, Blak In-Justice has also provided an opportunity to bring together works by First Nations artists who have created political art engaging with the problem.\n\n\"It's a call of concern ... but it's also a call for action,\" he says.\n\nThat action is to turn around a brutal series of statistics. Morris highlights some:\n\nIndigenous people are 4 per cent of the population, yet 36 per cent of the national adult prison population. Indigenous men are 17 times more likely to go to prison than non-Indigenous men. Indigenous women are 27 times more likely to be incarcerated.\n\nJulie Dowling's 2002 painting, The Visit, is dedicated to \"all the mothers kept in prison for trivial crimes such as unpaid fines and other crimes of poverty\". (Supplied: Heidi Museum of Modern Art)\n\nAs we walk down the corridor leading into the exhibition, my eyes fix on a quote plastered across the archway. It's from the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart.\n\n\"We are not an innately criminal people,\" reads part of it.\n\nA truth-telling exhibition\n\nBlak In-Justice presents works by the who's who of Australian First Peoples artists \u2014 Richard Bell, Reko Rennie, Gordon Bennett, Jimmie Pike, Destiny Deacon \u2014 alongside works by participants in The Torch program, which brings art teaching and support to currently incarcerated or recently released First Peoples in Victoria.\n\nThe first room of the Blak In-Justice exhibition presents the full force of the problem.\n\nRichard Bell's painting, Walk On (Bell's Theorem), 2007, alludes to Aboriginal deaths in custody with its words, \"We live in the valley of the shadow of death.\" (Supplied: Heidi Museum of Modern Art)\n\nThe walls are painted a dusty blue \u2014 symbolic of both the blue stone of the earth, representing Country, and the bluestone walls of Loddon, of Pentridge, common to our prisons and former prisons in Victoria.\n\n\"The exhibition's grounded in Country,\" Morris explains. \"Even the bluestone walls \u2014 that's rock from the Country as well. And those prisons are built on our Country too.\"\n\nSet against the walls are visceral works from well-known Indigenous artists. The bright hues of Reko Rennie's Three Little Pigs (2024), depicting three white police officers against a red background holding down a faceless Indigenous figure in yellow, a police officer's knee in the restrained man's back. The red scars and hanging ropes of Gordon Bennett's Bloodlines (1993).\n\n65,000 Years: A Short History of Australian Art Photo shows Photograph of woman surrounded by green shrub and trees holds a large butterfly on her hand and looks down at it. Professor Marcia Langton is \"overwhelmed\" by a monumental celebration of Aboriginal art and design.\n\nA striking work, Blood Tears (2023) by Judy Watson is at one end of the room, made up of long red strips of plastic, punched out with the names of Aboriginal people who have died in custody, in Braille.\n\nThe works are in-your-face, political, satirical, shocking, starkly depicting police brutality and the systemic problems of the justice system Indigenous people are up against.\n\nSome of it is hard to look at, but that \u2014 Morris says \u2014 is the point.\n\n\"This is hard-hitting. But it's all truth-telling, you know? It's shared and lived experiences.\" He says this gravely, before his eyes fire up, his gears shift. \"I mean, here,\" Morris says, steering me towards the next room, \"Well, this is the solution that we've created for ourselves.\"\n\n'This program saved my life'\n\nThe next part of the exhibition opens out in walls painted in soft ochre, the themes and colours presented in the works displayed against them offering a vastly different experience to that of the room before.\n\nPlayfully painted emus appear in frames with candy-bright backgrounds, splendid blue wrens and pelicans against a black-and-white diamond pattern.\n\n\"It means so much to me when people buy my artwork because it's kept me out of jail, it's given me a better life,\" says Thelma Beeton (co-creator with Stacey Edwards of this 2021 painting, Banj Banj/nawnta). (Supplied: Heidi Museum of Modern Art)\n\nIn the centre, carved wooden pelicans gather in a circle. Morris tells me proudly that this work by Torch participant Daniel Church, Pelican Mudjin (Family), 2022, was acquired as part of the National Gallery of Victoria's permanent collection.\n\nMorris says the support The Torch provides to connect or reconnect artists with art practice, Country and culture gives them strength and purpose.\n\nAnd, importantly, the money the participants make from their art (100 per cent of the artwork price goes to the artist) enables them to support their families and imagine a life for themselves beyond prison.\n\n\"[It means] you're not just on the outside of society. You're actually included, and you have a part to play, and you have a story to tell.\"\n\nAs we walk through Blak In-Justice, Morris's stories send us zig-zagging across the room \u2014 stories of those in The Torch who have gone on to major art awards, like ceramicist Raymond Young, or who have come back to teach or otherwise work as part of the program, like Stacey Edwards.\n\n\"It's not just based around being an artist,\" Morris says. \"This really is about people removing the shackles and finding their pathway. People are going into employment, education, training and employment, a whole range of areas.\"\n\nDestiny Deacon was \"deeply political and unashamedly blak\", the ABC's Daniel Browning has said. (Supplied: Heidi Museum of Modern Art)\n\nMorris says every year artists come up to him to say, \"This saved my life. This program saved my life.\"\n\nHe wants to see that fact getting broader recognition and support.\n\n\"Solutions [to Indigenous over-representation in prisons] won't come from the non-Indigenous community, but they really need the support of the non-Indigenous community.\n\n\" At the Torch, we're still running on the smell of an oily rag. Whereas imagine the impacts if there was greater investment and belief in supporting this. \"\n\nThe Torch's success story is told not only in the stats (the recidivism rates of participants is more than half that of non-participants), but in these human stories, many of whose voices are part of the exhibition, through video documentary, panels accompanying their works and in large quotes on the walls.\n\nFor Morris, it's not surprising the program has had such success because it's been developed for Indigenous people, by Indigenous people. Although The Torch began in 2011, it was built on the back of more than 40 years of activism and listening to community.\n\n\"Solutions will only come from our community because we're the ones who have the most at stake,\" he says. \"We care the most, and we believe and have hope. And this is one extraordinary example.\"\n\nBlak In-Justice: Incarceration and Resilience is at Heide Museum of Modern Art (Naarm/Melbourne) until July 20, 2025.",

(Supplied: CS Energy)\n\nIt's not the first explosion at the plant in recent years.\n\nIn May 2021, multiple generators and high voltage transmission lines in Queensland were tripped following an explosion in the C4 unit at Callide.\n\nThe incident caused nearly 500,000 customers to lose power, from the NSW border to north of Cairns.\n\nPremier David Crisafulli yesterday welcomed the plant's return to service, and said his government would focus on long-term maintenance of the plant.\n\n\"Obviously that's good news, but that doesn't change my focus that unless we spend long-term maintenance on those assets, we're not going to have them as reliable as what they should be,\" Mr Crisafulli said.\n\n\"But I stress we are still some time away before the investment return on to those plants can give the reliability that they deserve.\"\n\nThe Callide Power Station is located just outside Biloela in central Queensland. (ABC Capricornia: Tobi Loftus)\n\nCallide Power Station has two power plants \u2014 B and C \u2014 which each have two generating units.\n\nState-owned CS Energy owns and operates Callide B, and it owns Callide C in a 50-50 joint venture with Czech company 7GI.\n\nThe most recent explosion in April led to CS Energy's CEO and general managers resigning.",

They expressed gratitude for the Trump administration's high-level engagement to prevent disruption to US auto production and the supply chain.\n\nBozzella noted that the automotive issue was on the agenda during Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer's talks with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva earlier this month.\n\nMr Greer told CNBC on Friday that China had agreed to lift restrictions on the exports of rare-earth magnets to US companies and was not moving fast enough to grant access for key US industries.\n\n\"We haven't seen the flow of some of those critical minerals as they were supposed to be doing,\" he said.\n\nChina \u2014 which controls over 90% of global processing capacity for the magnets used in everything from automobiles and fighter jets to home appliances \u2014 imposed restrictions in early April requiring exporters to obtain licenses from Beijing.\n\nRare-earth magnet exports from China halved in April as companies grappled with an opaque application process for permits that sometimes require hundreds of pages of documents.\n\nIn a social-media post Friday, President Donald Trump accused China of violating the terms of a deal reached this month to temporarily dial back tariffs and other trade restrictions.\n\n\"China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\" Mr Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nChina's embassy in Washington responded by saying it was the US that was abusing export controls in the semiconductor sector.\n\nA US official with knowledge of the talks told Reuters that only tariffs and Chinese non-tariff countermeasures were covered in Geneva talks, and that US export controls were not part of the deal.\n\nThe official also expressed frustration that Beijing appeared to be moving slowly on promises to issue rare-earth export licenses, which could kick start export control retaliation by Washington if automakers vulnerable to shortages of the minerals were forced to halt production.\n\nWhile a handful of licenses have been granted, including to some Volkswagen suppliers, Indian automakers said they had still received none and would have to stop production in early June.\n\nGerman auto parts maker Bosch said this week that its suppliers had been bogged down by China's more-rigorous procedures to receive export licenses.\n\nA Bosch spokesperson described the process as \"complex and time-consuming, partly due to the need to collect and provide a lot of information.\"",

(Supplied: Breast Cancer Network Australia)\n\nHigh breast density not only makes breast cancer harder to detect through routine 2D mammography, but is also an independent risk factor for developing breast cancer.\n\nBreastScreen Australia is the national screening program, jointly funded by the federal, state and territory governments, to provide free mammograms through state-run services.\n\nThere have long been calls for BreastScreen Australia to change its national policy not to record participants' breast density, nor report it to them.\n\nLast week, BreastScreen Australia updated its policy to recommend that everyone screened be informed in writing of their breast density, and encouraged to have further discussions with their GP about additional screening options.\n\nBut currently only New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia measure and report breast density.\n\nVicki Durston from Breast Cancer Network Australia says everyone has a right to know their breast density and understand their breast cancer risk. (Supplied.)\n\nBreast Cancer Network Australia's Vicki Durston said a person's access to potentially lifesaving information about their breast density and cancer risk shouldn't be dependent on where they lived.\n\n\"Every woman has the right to know her breast density and understand her breast cancer risk,\" Ms Durston said.\n\n\"We need every state and territory to act now to provide this information, along with clear pathways for supporting women at higher risk.\n\n\"The progress being made elsewhere shows timely implementation is both achievable and beneficial for women.\"\n\nIn a statement, the ACT government said it was \"working on plans to introduce recording and reporting of breast density following mammograms\", but it did not have a timeline for implementation.\n\nOn their websites, BreastScreen Queensland says it's \"actively working towards statewide implementation of breast density recording and reporting\", while BreastScreen NT says breast density will be included in results by 2026.\n\n'A polar bear in a snowstorm'\n\nKym Berchtenbreiter, who has lived experience with breast cancer, said if she had known she had dense breasts when she received a negative mammogram result her outcome may not have been as severe.\n\nKym Berchtenbreiter says it's vital people are informed about their breast density so they can make informed decisions. (Supplied: Breast Cancer Network Australia)\n\n\"If I'd known that I had extremely dense breasts \u2026 I could have looked into the possibility of having supplemental screening, and perhaps my outcome might not have been as severe as it was,\" Ms Berchtenbreiter said.\n\n\"[Instead] within 12 months of that negative result I was subsequently diagnosed with early breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy and years of hormone blocking treatment.\n\n\"But I'm one of the lucky ones. I'm still here to tell this story.\n\n\"There are others who are not that fortunate because interval cancers got missed in a screening.\"\n\nA tumour in fatty breast tissue (left) is much easier to see on a 2D mammogram than a tumour in dense breast tissue (right). (Supplied: Breast Cancer Network Australia)\n\nMs Berchtenbreiter said it was important to inform people of their breast density because looking for a tumour in very dense breast tissue was \"a bit like looking for a polar bear in a snowstorm\".\n\n\"It's vital that women are informed about their breast density, so they can make informed decisions about supplemental screening options,\" she said.\n\n\"We are so fortunate to have a breast screening program in Australia but let's make it even better, and save more lives, by having a national commitment to reporting breast density.\"\n\nWomen can't tell their own breast density\n\nBreast Cancer Network Australia says 58 people are diagnosed with breast cancer every day in Australia.\n\nNational Breast Cancer Foundation CEO Cleola Anderiesz says early detection is critical to improving breast cancer outcomes. (LinkedIn: Cleola Anderiesz)\n\nNational Breast Cancer Foundation chief executive Cleola Anderiesz said nobody could tell their own breast density.\n\n\"The size of your breast, or how firm or not firm your breast feels, doesn't give you any indication of your breast density. It has to be detected through a mammogram,\" Ms Anderiesz said.\n\n\"What it measures is the relative amount of dense breast tissue \u2014 so glandular and connective tissue, which actually appears white on the mammogram \u2014 compared to non-dense \u2014 or fatty \u2014 tissue, which appears dark.\"\n\nShe said early detection was critical to improving outcomes from a breast cancer diagnosis.\n\n\"We know that if your breast cancer is diagnosed early in Australia, your outcomes are much better,\" Ms Anderiesz said.\n\n\"For example if your breast cancer is diagnosed at what we call stage one, where it's still confined to your breast, your five-year survival outcomes are actually 100 per cent.\n\n\"So it's a really important thing for women to be informed about because they can then have a shared conversation with their GP or their breast specialist about their level of risk of developing breast cancer \u2014 and ultimately that knowledge is power.\"\n\nJenny Edwards is currently undergoing radiation treatment. (ABC News: Joel Wilson)\n\nMs Edwards said her message to others who didn't know if they had dense breasts was to \"go get screened\".\n\n\"Now that I know so much more about breast cancer it seems like [breast density checks are] really very important,\" she said.\n\n\"I've got an adult daughter who now, because of her family history, I suspect also has dense breasts.\n\n\"It would be good to know that so she can monitor things earlier than the free mammograms, which kick in at 40.\"",

    "text": "Apart from trying to show that he still has some, albeit more limited, authority to act on tariffs, Trump\u2019s announcement, to a rally of US steelworks, had a secondary purpose. Loading During last year\u2019s election campaign, Trump was vehemently opposed to a proposed $US15 billion ($23.3 billion) acquisition of US Steel by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel \u2013 as was Joe Biden, who blocked the deal only days before he left office. Both were chasing the votes of steelworkers and their powerful union in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered and has its major plants. Having won the election, however, Trump has had a change of mind.\n\nWhile the US will impose some significant conditions on the deal \u2013 including, perhaps, a \u201cgolden share\u201d that would give the government a veto over major decisions along with a commitment from Nippon Steel to appoint a US chief executive and a majority of Americans to the board \u2013 it now appears that he will approve the deal, even though he says he hasn\u2019t seen its final details. Nippon Steel, one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated steel producers, has promised to invest about $US14 billion in US Steel\u2019s operations, which have been struggling, shrinking and suffering from under-investment for decades. Trump\u2019s doubling of the tariff rate for steel and aluminium is a way of justifying the decision to approve the deal, as well as enhancing the economics of US Steel and other US steelmakers and helping to underwrite Nippon Steel\u2019s massive investments, most of which will occur over the next four years. Trump\u2019s original tariffs on steel and aluminium infuriated America\u2019s trade partners, including Australia, even though Australia\u2019s exports of those metals to the US are quite modest. Canada, whose steel exports represent about a quarter of US steel imports and half its aluminium imports, has far more at stake.\n\nMexico, Brazil, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan and European nations will also be impacted, with Canada and the European Union already threatening retaliation, as they did in response to Trump\u2019s initial 25 per cent tariffs. Australia is still, probably fruitlessly, seeking an exemption. Loading The decision to allow the Nippon Streel deal to proceed, if that is the outcome, is good policy. The US steel industry is small \u2013 about half the size it was half a century ago \u2013 and has been shrinking. It has poor profitability and ageing technology. Nippon Steel\u2019s investment and its technologies can arrest that decline. The decision to double the tariffs on steel \u2013 indeed the original decision to impose the 25 per cent tariff \u2013 is, however, poor policy. It will increase investment in the sector, and will probably improve its profitability, plant utilisation rates and employment numbers. But that will come at a significant cost.\n\nIn 2018, when Trump first imposed tariffs on imported steel, steel prices rose almost 10 per cent, the sector\u2019s profits rose by about $US2.5 billion, capacity utilisation jumped from 74 per cent to about 80 per cent and nearly 10,000 jobs were added within the sector. The impact was quite short-lived, with those numbers subsequently reversing as the industry resumed its long-term decline. The initial impact was predictable. Tariffs are protectionist. They protect domestic industries and companies from more efficient producers elsewhere by boosting their sales, margins and profits. That\u2019s what happened after the 2018 tariffs. Loading They come, however, at a cost to the customers of the protected industries, which is also what happened after Trump\u2019s 2018 tariffs were imposed. A Peterson Institute for International Economics study concluded that the 2018 tariffs cost US downstream steel-using industries about $US5.6 billion, or about $US650,000 for each new job they added in the steel sector. The US Federal Reserve Board concluded that they cost about 75,000 jobs in those downstream industries, or more than eight times the number of jobs added by the steelmakers.",

    "text": "Perruzza said he was seeing an increasing number of properties selling through private sale rather than at auction. Loading \u201cSales are being made, but auctions are very hit and miss,\u201d he said. A nearby home, 4 Maryville Street in Ripponlea, also failed to secure any bids at auction. Listed with a price range of $2.875 million to $3.15 million, the four-bedroom, renovated home is located in the coveted Brunning estate.\n\n\u201cIt is a tightly held suburb, so it\u2019s not very often you get the opportunity to buy a block this big,\u201d said lead agent Rachael O\u2019Connor from McGrath Estate Agents St Kilda. While one registered bidder was at the auction, O\u2019Connor said they didn\u2019t make a bid and declined to negotiate privately afterwards. O\u2019Connor had been hopeful that more stock would come onto the market in the area after the federal election, but that has not happened. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the lowest levels of quality stock I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two homes were among 1417 scheduled auctions across Melbourne over the past week. By Saturday evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 70.3 per cent from 1048 reported results, while 105 auctions were withdrawn. Loading Separate figures from Cotality, formerly CoreLogic, found Melbourne home values rose 0.4 per cent in May. Louis Christopher, the general manager and head of research at SQM, cautioned against hastily interpreting the week\u2019s auction results, as they were affected by a surge in auction volume due to coming King\u2019s Birthday long weekend. \u201cThe amount of auction stock substantially increased from last week; it\u2019s in excess of 30 per cent since,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLong weekends are usually quiet on the auction front, and if sellers realise that their auction date falls on a long weekend, they often bring the date forward, which is why we see this spike.\u201d In Chelsea, a 1920s period weatherboard home sold $255,000 over the reserve, for $1.505 million. The home at 32 Catherine Street had a price guide of $1.18 million to $1.22 million, with a reserve of $1.25 million. There is no legal requirement for a vendor\u2019s reserve to be in line with their property\u2019s price guide. Lead agent Ruben Gueli from Ray White Chelsea, said the result \u201ceclipsed expectations\u201d.\n\nLoading There were 10 registered bidders, six of whom were active in the auction. \u201cThe proceedings kicked off with a bang,\u201d Gueli said. \u201cThe opening bid came in $110,000 above the top of the price range. This shocked everyone and really set the tone for the rest of the competitive auction.\u201d The auction finale was a tussle between two couples who were drawn to the beachside location and quality renovation.\n\n\u201cThey were going bid for bid, but it was ultimately sold to a young couple starting a family,\u201d Gueli said. The sellers had owned the property for 10 years, one of whom was Ray White Judd White director Andrew Dimashki. In Footscray, a three-bedroom period home passed in at auction but sold in private negotiation for $865,000 afterwards. The home at 68 Essex Street was listed with a price guide of $800,000 to its reserve price of $870,000.",

Despite the perceived performance benefits of cutting the Rebels, the four remaining Australian sides have actually won fewer games against the Kiwis this year. They have won seven this year compared to nine last year, with the discrepancy explained by both the Reds and Brumbies flipping from a 3-2 trans-Tasman winning record in 2024 to a 2-3 losing one. While the early-season narrative was one of Australian improvement, it quietly flipped about two-thirds of the way through the competition, and the last win against a New Zealand team was the Reds\u2019 victory against the Blues in round 11. It\u2019s an obvious concern on the eve of the British and Lions series.\n\nTwo-tier Super has a problem\n\nThe win-loss record outline above is part of a much broader problem.

In fact, in the competition\u2019s history (beginning in 2022) only eight teams have finished in the top six, the Waratahs sneaking in twice (6th in 2023 and 6th in 2022) and the Highlanders sneaking in once (6th in 2024). It\u2019s a competition with bedded-in haves and have-nots, as the points differential from this year highlights again. The big six all have positive points differentials, and the rest have deeply negative ones, with the Highlanders the \u2018best\u2019 at minus 90. This is one reason why this column has been sympathetic towards Dan McKellar at the Waratahs this year. He\u2019s walked into a job in the current have-nots, and Super Rugby\u2019s lack of player movement makes upward mobility very hard to achieve.",

All this was true.\n\nAnd yet inside it all was the other story Beth Gibbons tells, of that darkness in shades of uncertainty, of a taut line holding rhythms close and emotions closer still, of drums as likely to be played with mallets as sticks, sonorous rather than sharp.\n\nAnd most of all of the intensity that held, compelled through everything, broken only when at the end of each song Gibbons \u2013 whose voice is unchanged, and if anything even firmer \u2013 turned her back, retreated to the even darker space behind and broke from our gaze.",

It will increase costs for consumers in the United States because it is supplied across the board. What it will do is not create any comparative advantage or disadvantage compared with other countries that export into the United States. It is an inappropriate action by the Trump administration.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government is being urged again to consider using targeted sanctions against Israel over its actions in blocking aid in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor party M-P Ed Husic has been joined by former Labor foreign ministers Gareth Evans and Bob Carr - have called for Australia to join the UK, France and Canada in signalling the use of targeted sanctions, if Israel fails to stop the renewed military offensive and lift all of the restrictions on aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has so far rejected the calls, saying he is focused on peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians rather than soundbites.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Husic has also urged the federal government to consider backing Palestinian statehood at a UN conference on a two-state solution to be held in New York later this month [[17-20 June]].\n\n\n\n\n\nActivist Reem Borrows, from Palestine Australia Relief and Action, has told SBS Arabic much stronger intervention is needed from the Australian government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The responsibility is on the globe, Australia included, to finish this with justice, freedom for all. The first step is to stop what is happening in Gaza, that\u2019s the first step, but not only to treat the symptoms. This is what we\u2019ve got be very careful of.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal opposition is accusing social media giant TikTok of trying to bully Australia on the issue of social media age restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe laws passed during the last federal parliament putting in place a ban for those aged under 16 from using platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok comes into force in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok last week brought four and half pages of national newspaper advertising challenging the government on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut senior opposition frontbencher, James Paterson, has told the Nine Network that TikTok, unlike some other platforms, has no educational value, and kids needs to be protected from some of the content on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really important that the Prime Minister doesn't back down here. Because TikTok is not a safe place for children. And surely every parent who's seen the effects of these social media platforms would understand and agree with that. There is no educational content on TikTok, and that is not what kids are getting from TikTok- it's a lot of other stuff, frankly, that is not appropriate for them at their age. So, I really hope the Prime Minister shows some strength here, doesn't back down to this attempted bullying campaing from TikTok, and makes sure that children are protected from what is a really harmful platform.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Business Council of Australia has called on the federal government to have a focus on supporting innovation in its strategy to regulate A-I.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new report, the group warns against over-regulation, saying the country has vast land resources that could be used for data centres for AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report says that Australians more than people in many other countries, express nervousness about AI, and that could lead to over-regulation\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no specific laws or regulations that directly regulate AI in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government is considering different reform options to mandate guardrails for AI systems deemed high risk, including introducing a new AI Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales government is investing more than half a billion dollars in dealing with domestic violence, trying to fix what it says has been years of neglect in regards to the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state budget, to be handed down on the 24th of June, will provide 227 million dollars over five years for the state's victim support service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother 50 million dollars will be allocated towards measures to make it easier for victim-survivors to give evidence in court, via remote courtrooms, making sure they don't have to attend the same court complex as their alleged abuser.\n\n\n\n\n\nA hub will also be built to provide counselling, legal aid, and financial advice to those impacted.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will open in late 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you or someone you know needs support.. you can seek 24 hour help through a phone call to 1800 RESPECT.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's 1800 737 732.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nExit polls released on the second round of Poland's presidential election shows the contest is too close to call.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial results are due later today [[Mon morning local time]].\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo exit polls show the pro-European Warsaw mayor, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, very marginally ahead of the historian and former amateur boxer Karol Nawrocki.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat hasn't stopped Mr Trzaskowski claiming victory in front of cheering supporters in Warsaw.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Polish then translated into English): \"This is truly a special moment in Polish history. I am convinced that it will help us all move forward like a torpedo and focus primarily on the future. This is what I was very keen on throughout this campaign, to tell all Polish women and men that I will unite, I will build. I will truly be the president of all Polish women nd men, I will be your president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Nawrocki says it is too early to call the election result, but he believes he will win.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, multiple people have been injured in an attack in the city of Boulder in northern Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n\nWitnesses say a man threw bottles that apparently contained flammable liquid, which hit the ground and exploded in flames.\n\n\n\n\n\nA suspect is in custody and police are investigating what FBI officials immediately called a targeted terror attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, local authorities say it is too early to know the motive of the attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Redfearn is the chief of Boulder Police.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries... There was group of pro-Israel. People that were there in a peaceful demonstration. I wouldn't even call it a protest. They were there in that area. We're looking and actively interviewing victims and witnesses to determine if that group was targeted or others. And we just don't have those answers yet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, Joe Montemurro will be the new coach of the Matildas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's signed a three year deal to be coach of the national side through the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, a period which will also inlcude the 2026 Asian Cup on home soil, and the 2027 World Cup in Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 55-year-old Aussie was most recently coach of French side Lyon [[lee-on]].\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's previously coached English side Arsenal, Italian side Juventus, and A-League side Melbourne City to women's league titles.\n\n\n\n\n\nMontemurro's hiring ends the long search for a successor to Tony Gustavsson, who left after the Olympics last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterim coach Tom Sermanni will coach tonight's [[mon]] game against Argentina in Canberra.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Key Points A new Treasury analysis estimates natural disasters caused a $2.2 billion decline in economic activity in 2025.\n\nMajor disasters include Cyclone Alfred and widespread flooding in NSW and Queensland.\n\nPartial data for March quarter shows disasters particularly impacted retail trade and household spending.\n\nThe cost of lost economic activity because of natural disasters in 2025 has been estimated at $2.2 billion, after Treasury analysed the impacts of Cyclone Alfred and floods across NSW and Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial data for the March quarter shows natural disasters particularly impacted retail trade and household spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $2.2 billion figure is based on Treasury's initial assessment at the time of the disasters and there may be rebuilding activity in future quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the overall immediate loss in economic activity is expected to impact the March quarter, which will be reflected in the March quarter National Accounts, to be released on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said the government's top priority was to help fund the recovery and rebuilding of communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The human impacts matter to us most but the economic cost is very significant too and we'll see that in Wednesday's National Accounts,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because of the progress Australians have made together in the economy, with inflation down, debt down and unemployment low, we're in a stronger position to provide support when communities need it most.\"\n\n\n\nNominal retail trade in Queensland fell 0.3 per cent in February and 0.4 per cent in March.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn volume terms, the Australian Bureau of Statistics' monthly household spending indicator was flat in the March quarter, with a 0.2 per cent fall in Queensland contributing to this.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlooding in NSW in late May, from the Hunter to the mid-north coast, has left 10,000 homes and businesses damaged or destroyed . The Insurance Council of Australia reported that more than 6,000 insurance claims have been made.\n\n\n\nIn early March, Tropical Cyclone Alfred crossed the coast on Moreton Island and subsequently caused widespread damage and flooding to communities across south-east Queensland and northern NSW.\n\n\n\n\n\nProlonged downpours in south-west and central Queensland in late March and early April flooded a vast area spanning about one million square kilometres.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government's Disaster Assist website lists 27 separate natural disasters from January-May, consisting of flooding, storms, cyclones and bushfires.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley will visit flood-affected communities on the mid-north coast on Monday with local MPs.\n\n\n\nEmergency Management Minister Kristy McBain said the government was funding measures to increase resilience, adaptability and preparedness, and the Disaster Ready Fund initiative would provide another $200 million in 2025-26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have recently been on the ground in NSW seeing first-hand the effects a disaster can have, and it is my priority to work closely with all levels of government to ensure support is provided as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have activated multiple disaster payments and we will continue to work with NSW on any other funding requests and I have been meeting with small business and primary producers who have been hit hard.\"\n\n\n\n",

The voice of ethnic Australia. Today the program is in Greek.\" A Greek translation of the above words follows.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadcasting began in seven languages in Sydney on 2EA, and eight on Melbourne's 3EA, with the first broadcast as you just heard in Greek.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS, as it's now known, emerged just two years after the country abolished the Immigration Restriction Act - mostly known as the White Australia Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCultural historian and Emeritus Professor Ien Ang from the University of Western Sydney authored \"The SBS Story\" published in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the abolition of the policy was a turning point for Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That was the early 1970s when finally the White Australia policy was officially abolished and that made it possible for migrants to come into Australia irrespective of racial categories. So before that, of course there was this assumption that only people who were white could come into Australia after the abolition of the White Australia policy migrants came into Australia from all over the world, and especially from Asian countries. But also from the Middle East and much later from Africa and so forth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy dated back to Federation coming into law in 1901.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt its core it was about excluding non-European immigrants from Australia and it took more than 70 years for the policy to be officially scrapped.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat happened in 1973 when the final remnants of the policy were removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a time of great change in Australia - racial barriers of all kinds were being broken.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it had only been a couple years since Indigenous Australians were recognised as citizens in a 1967 referendum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Australian civil rights activist Faith Bandler speaking ahead of the 1967 referendum to Channel 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think that we should take it for granted that there will be a yes vote for the Aborigine. And I feel that the time has come that Australia can no longer tolerate legal discrimination against its Indigenous people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1975 also saw the largest constitutional crisis ever to grip the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well may we say God save the Queen because nothing will save the Governor-General (cheers).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam whose government was dismissed in 1975, the first and only Australian government to ever be dismissed by the Governor-General.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the legacies of the Whitlam government is that it was the first to refer to Australia as a multicultural nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition at the time had also made speeches about multiculturalism.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Frazer's Liberal government, which took power in 1975, opened the door for refugees fleeing the Vietnam war to come to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nJock Collins, who was a Professor of Social Economics at the University of Technology for 45 years, says this marked a cultural shift in Australia' s refugee intake program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Fraser government at the time was very open to the boat people and to refugees in contrast maybe to some of the political parties today. And that was the beginning of a massive change because up till that time, the government in 47 promised nine out of 10 immigrants to Australia would be Britain and British. That didn't happen. And we had to take in refugees from displaced people from Eastern Europe and southern Europeans to keep the numbers up. We could never attract as many Brits as we wanted, but until that moment we really weren't getting any Asian or coloured immigrants. And of course, 75 with the Vietnamese boat people today jumped very quickly forward. The largest immigrant intakes are Indian and Chinese immigrants who of course were blocked because of the white Australian policy then. So really there's been a dramatic change since the mid seventies in the Australian immigration history and story.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1977, the Vietnamese community got their first radio program on SBS.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicky Chung's parents fled the Vietnam war in the 1970s - making Australia home.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says when her family arrived after the war, SBS was a vital source of information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can really talk from personal experience there because our family came over in 1979 after the fall of Saigon, and we were connected with SBS media as soon as we were here, really very shortly after. I know that from a personal experience in our family, we used to watch the news every night. When I spoke with my parents about our experience with SBS, it was very much about being able to have a very trusted media source too. The reality was that when we first arrived, we really wanted to understand the culture here in Australia very quickly. We still, though, wanted to stay connected to what was happening around the world, including Vietnam.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Chung is now the CEO of the Australian Vietnamese Women's Association.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifty years since the fall of Saigon she says her dad still listens to the Vietnamese program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My dad says, he still goes for his morning walks and he has said to me, he streams SBS from the app to listen to good news where his words and good items to keep abreast of what's happening around Australia, around other world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1970s were also a time when Australia started to question the policy of assimilation - the idea that migrants had to become Australian as quickly as possible - whatever that meant.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it wasn't as if multiculturalism was anything new in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor around 65,000 years Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have lived here making up of more than 250 language and tribal groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd today SBS's NITV provides Indigenous content for Australian audiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, Dr Professor Ang says almost every society has had multiple cultural influences, whether through, trade, colonisation or other means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you think of diverse societies, how successful they are, not just in recent times, but historically I think it's quite clear that openness to diversity is in a way an important driver for much more dynamic cross-cultural influences that then become creative forces in society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1975 also saw the Khmer Rouge regime take power in Cambodia under the rule of Pol Pot.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 1.5 million Cambodians died from starvation, forced labour or execution under the regime that became known as the killing fields.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a report from the ABC at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Khmer Rouge leaders planned to remould Cambodia into a rural Communist utopia and would spare not life to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis saw a wave of refugees and immigrants arrive in Australia from Cambodia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first significant wave occurred after the late 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore then many Cambodians spent years in refugee camps in neighbouring countries such as Thailand before relocating to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Phiny Ung 1975 was a significant year - for all the wrong reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the year she and her family were forced to flee Cambodia to save their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every year for me 17th of April, It's a really significant day that I become numb. I try, not that I try to forget, but I do not want to think about it, but it's always there. So I knew it is anniversary of that time no matter where I go and no different for this year. And I try to keep quiet and think back of that time, it just like yesterday, 50 years, but it was just like yesterday. It was a lot. Or we do remember that we have to leave the city by force.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growing Khmer-speaking community from Cambodia saw the introduction of the first Khmer program on SBS Radio back in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt around the same time colour TV was quickly becoming common in many Australian households.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 1980 SBS took its next big step forward launching a television channel for the very first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Television will never be the same again because of us. Good evening. Welcome to the first edition of your Dateline. I'm Mike Carey. I'm Jana Wendt. Good day. Welcome.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new TV station offered world news, documentaries and international movies, cementing its place on the Australian media landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the ground Australia was rapidly evolving into the multilingual nation we see today.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore migrants and refugees arrived from Asia and the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular the civil war in Lebanon which started in 1975 and ended 15 years later, saw the growth of this community in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nArabic was introduced into the SBS Radio fold - which has now expanded into a 24-hour digital audio channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n(An excerpt from the Arabic program)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn politics the Labor government of Bob Hawke elected in 1983 brought in a new era of multicultural and immigration policy\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then multiculturalism has evolved beyond a philosophy and is now a reality in modern Australian.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jock Collins again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think multiculturalism had its peaks and troughs. It probably grew to a peak under the Keating Hawke- Labor government where multicultural was really championed by those governments and by the head of FECCA, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council was a very powerful ear in government policy and consulting since that time, various have sort of lost some enthusiasm for it. It still remains an official type of policy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, SBS was increasingly the place to go for fans of football or soccer encouraged by the National Soccer League launched in 1977.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Commentator: \"Good evening, welcome to World Soccer.\")\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the mid 1990s more languages were introduced into the SBS radio schedule and a thing called the internet began to go mainstream.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis marked the start of a revolution in how people now consume media.\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile phones are now a one stop listening and viewing shop for most Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shift from a community service in 1975 to a digital streaming powerhouse has been a successful one for SBS.\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging director of SBS James Taylor says SBS is also about providing value for Australian taxpayers who partly fund the broadcaster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got the highest volumes of multilingual content than ever before in our history. And in 60 languages. We're also being acknowledged across a number of other fronts. We've got the highest rating Australian streaming platform through SBS on demand, and we are the podcaster of the year, three years in a row. These are all things to really be celebrated. We're a public good, we are in part funded by the public, and it's really important for us to be delivering more and more value each year to Australians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd one of those 60 languages is Tetum, introduced in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nTetum is a language spoken on the island of Timor, which saw a big wave of migration to Australia in the wake of civil unrest and the Indonesian invasion in 1975.\n\n\n\n\n\nFleeing conflict, the community has established its roots across the country while maintaining its language and traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nJose Pires was 8 years old when his family fled violence in what was then known as East Timor in 1975.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a three-day journey on a Norwegian cargo ship, they arrived in Darwin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It all seemed like it happened very quickly. The civil war broke out. I was in school in Timor. And within a couple of weeks I was in Australia in a different place. We fled from our home to a house near the port and then we could not get there in the day, there was too much fighting a lot of shooting around that I can recall and early the next morning we were able to sneak in and managed to get on the port.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTimor-Leste achieved Independence from Indonesia in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for SBS it now broadcasts in 60 languages across audio, digital and television.\n\n\n\n",

Then they came back and got my roommate who's been living downstairs with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were going to take me as well, but they couldn't take our two dogs.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Facebook Sam wrote of the rescue: \"Probably the most traumatic thing I've ever endured having to restrain my beautiful two year old son in this bag screaming while his mum was being lifted up and pass him onto the roof to be lifted into the air with her.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSam said he decided to stay and wait for a State Emergency Service boat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They eventually did come. They came and got me with the two dogs,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was a moment there where we thought we might not get the dogs out, so when that did happen, it was quite a relief.\"\n\n\n\nSam said he launched straight into the cleanup and hasn't fully processed being rescued and coming back to a house left ruined by floodwater, mud and debris.\n\n\n\n\n\nSam's two-year-old son has been having nightmares about the helicopter rescue, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've got to be here [for the cleanup], but it's getting harder to get out of bed.\"\n\n\n\nSam Halloran and his neighbours resorted to starting a fire to burn off debris left by the floods, their entire street lined with mud, household goods, pieces of fencing and walls, as residents launched into a massive cleanup effort. Source: SBS News\n\nInsurance 'skyrocketed' after 2021 floods\n\nProtecting Sam's dream home and his young family's future was put at a very high price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had one insurance company that would have insured us, but it was over $30,000 a year, which we couldn't afford,\u201d Sam said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quote provided to Sam in August last year, seen by SBS News, shows the annual premium for standard building and contents insurance on their home was priced at $29,817.91.\n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance premiums in the area soared out of reach for most after floods in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year in the Manning Valley, the flood reached more than a metre higher than four years ago, so the insurance problem is only expected to worsen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's going to be people that were insured that won't be insured moving forward,\" Sam said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeigh, Sam's father, says he purchased insurance on the same home in 2002.\n\n\n\n\"I think I paid about $700 to insure the house. Yes, it was 20 years ago, but it's not comparable, is it?\" Leigh said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Insurance companies, sure, they're there to make a profit. I understand that. They wouldn't exist without profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But at the end of the day, they're putting premiums up far beyond the average household's budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hallorans said they'd only heard of one person in the area who was insured, but their premium was still over $10,000 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn their street, they didn't know of anyone able to afford the exorbitant premiums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No one in this entire street has flood insurance because they are all quoted around the $30,000 mark,\" Leigh said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, financial comparison site Canstar published its analysis of average annual premiums for home and contents insurance across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn NSW, the average combined policy costs $2,210, based on homes valued between $300,000 and $1.5 million with $50,000 in contents cover.\n\n\n\nSam Halloran was looking forward to raising his son on this picturesque street in Glenthorne, NSW. But he says insurance was out of reach for him and all of his neighbours. Source: SBS News\n\nInsurance companies, government under pressure to address growing problem\n\nThe Insurance Council of Australia has declared the recent NSW floods an 'insurance catastrophe', with nearly 8,000 claims processed as of Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to 10,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed, with more than 800 already declared uninhabitable.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a visit to Taree on Tuesday, SBS News asked Insurance Council of Australia CEO Andrew Hall whether he would support reforms to assist people who can't afford to insure their properties or businesses in flood zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we see that happen and particularly in events like we're going through here at the moment, it underscores the point that we have been making now for a number of years to government,\" Hall said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Insurance prices [relate to] the risk, and we know that in Australia there are around 220,000 homes that are built in high-risk flood zones like where we are right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to come up with a flood defence fund that can better flood-proof those properties, that can lift the home out of harm's way and, worst-case scenario, we may have to look at buybacks.\"\n\n\n\nHuge amounts of debris washed up against the back porch of this home in Taree show the scale of the damage caused by the floods. Source: SBS News Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, also speaking in Taree on Tuesday, acknowledged \"there are longer-term issues that need to be looked at\" to address the insurance problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We recognise that people are doing it really tough. I've said that more support is going to be needed,\" Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We expect insurance companies to do right by their customers and swiftly process claims. They've set up an office here so that they can be dealt with swiftly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But our focus now is on the cleanup and recovery from this event. That's our focus, the immediate needs.\"\n\n\n\nFederal Minister for Emergency Management Kristy McBain also told ABC's RN Breakfast program on Wednesday that insurance in flood-prone areas was a \"significant concern\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know for a number of the businesses and the farms that we spoke to, they either haven't been offered insurance or insurance was too expensive for them to take up,\" McBain said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said she and Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino would be having direct discussions with insurance companies and the Insurance Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Halloran told SBS News that the immediate relief provided by the federal government wasn't proportionate to the scale of the cleanup and recovery facing the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Seventy people from the [Australian Defence Force] \u2026 we've had more volunteers than that just in our street alone in the last week, so I don't know what 70 ADF members are supposed to do,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've got people here working that have run their own businesses, they're sole operators, and they've donated their time to help me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need machinery. At my place alone, there is something like 400 trucks worth of silt to get rid of.\"\n\n\n\nInsurance hike set to become 'unfathomable'\n\nA few doors down from the Hallorans, Daryl Hammond owns a farm. His main business is producing feed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seasonal nature of his business, he says, means insurance is nearly impossible for him to get.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can't insure anything because last month I had over 1,000 bales of silage. Come the end of July, August, I might have 50. How can I insure something like that?\" Hammond told SBS News last week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd be onto the broker every second day. It would cost me $20,000 [to] $30,000 a year just to have everything insured if I could insure it. And, I mean, mostly [the insurance companies] just shake their head.\"\n\n\n\nFeed producer Daryl Hammond told SBS News his business was impossible to insure, given the seasonal nature of his industry, and the flood-prone area in which he operates. Source: SBS News For Hammond, the Hallorans and their neighbours, they want to see change. The community wants to keep living where they have deep roots and connections, but also wants a way to protect their future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Houses like this are not a river frontage, there is a farm between us and the river. At the end of the day, yes, it's in a flood zone, but [the insurance] is becoming unfathomable,\" Leigh Halloran said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sam spent his teenage years here. It's a great community. Everyone just gets on perfectly, and it was a great place for him to grow up, and he wants to raise his son in this community, you know? Which is really, really nice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Halloran says it's impossible to predict what Mother Nature is going to do, but all levels of government need to work harder to prevent the impact of disasters on regional communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The 100-year flood development control in our local council area is, at the moment, 5.2 metres,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Anyone building a new house had to have a floor level of 5.7 metres. This flood was nearly 6.5 metres. So, someone could have built a brand-new house close to the river, had full insurance and still had this water through the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's something that we can't control. You can't not live near the river.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSam says with the level of damage seen in the homes and businesses of Taree, insuring \"is going to get worse, not better\".\n\n\n\n",

What we'll do is continue to provide for investing in our capability, but also investing in our relationships in the region.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt follows controversial comments from US Secretary of State Pete Hegseth at the Shangri-la defence forum in Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it's credible China is potentially preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the same forum defence minister Richard Marles defended Australia's defence spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I mean, the Americans have been very clear about wanting to see more from their friends and allies around the world. It's a sentiment that we understand, and as I've repeatedly said, that's a conversation we are totally up for in terms of the way in which we engage with the United States. And as I said, I think on Friday, in our bilateral meeting Secretary Hegseth did raise the question of increased defence expenditure on the Australian side. Of course we have already engaged in the last couple of years in the single biggest peacetime increase in defence expenditure in Australia's history, so we are beginning this journey.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia currently spends roughly 2 per cent of its GDP, or $56 billion dollars, on defence, and the government says this will grow to 2.35 per cent by 2034.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoalition finance spokesperson James Paterson told Sky News that's not enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They don't plan to increase defence spending until the end of the decade, and that doesn't meet the challenge of the moment. One of the policies I was most proud of that we took to the last election was to increase defence spending to two and a half percent of GDP within five years and to three percent of GDP within a decade. That reckons with the environment that we are dealing with in our own region, it takes it seriously, and it responds to it to make sure that we can safeguard our own sovereignty and our own freedom.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDefence isn't the only test to relations with Australia's closest ally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister is also facing renewed pressure to secure an exemption against steel and aluminium tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump has just announced these will be doubled from 25 to 50 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese is expected to raise the matter with Mr Trump if they meet on the sidelines of the G7 later this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud has told Chanel 9 it's important Australia secures exemptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have a compelling case to have a carve out, even if you take away insanity of these tariffs as a whole, because of our relationship, and the check, we just dropped for submarines with the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen told the ABC Australia hasn't ruled out taking the issue to the World Trade Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOWEN: \"We will consider all options available to defend the best interest of Australian industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJOURNALIST: \"So, that is an option?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBOWEN: \"Well, self, evidently, it's an option but I'm not going to pre-empt discussions. The first, the first port of call is to make the strongest possible representations at all levels to the United States, and hope that we can avoid the issue in the first place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRaising the dispute in the World Trade Organization is seen as unlikely given Australia is not alone in being slapped with US tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent rulings from US courts have also cast doubt on the president's power to level some tariffs, including reciprocal and baseline levies.\n\n\n\n",

It has profoundly impacted mental health. At now 18, Max's mum has lost count of the number of suicide attempts. Max's mother told us Max doesn't want to die, but also cannot live like this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, one in every 100 school-aged children lives with Tourette Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says Max's story reflects the ongoing challenges that young Australians living with the condition have been facing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, Max's story reflects the harsh reality based by meaning living with Tourette's and other tic conditions in this country: long waits for diagnosis, limited access to effective treatment, turned away by the NDIS, stigma, discrimination, not being believed, limited understanding and support in schools and workplaces, and this sadly results in severe mental health issues. These challenges aren't new and they've been ignored for far too long.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ari is a co-author of Impact for Tourette, Australia's first national survey looking at the mental health of people living with Tourette Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt interviewed over 200 individuals and caregivers, finding one in two children with a tic-related disorder has thought about ending their life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it found one in ten children has actually attempted suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also found there is a shortage of psychologists with the expertise to offer treatment for tic disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Amanda Maxwell is a Clinical Psychologist and Clinical Research Manager at the UNSW Tic Clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that lack of psychological services has pushed people to seek medication to treat tic-related disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now medication can be very helpful, but of the sample that we surveyed, 50% said that it did not control their tics or minimally controlled their tics. And there's obvious side effects as well with some of the medications. In terms of the impact on function it was great. So 80% of our survey, those surveyed experienced tic daily and about 50% of the children reported that they didn't have tic-free periods of more than five to 10 minutes in a day - so they're ticcing all through the day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith those symptoms, many living with the condition - like Max - are unlikely to be able to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to Dr Maxwell, they're also struggling to get their NDIS application approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The financial burden is great. It's not just because some adults are unable to work, but there is also a significant cost of accessing healthcare for these young people. One in 20 had NDIS funding. Three out of four had their applications denied. My experience and the experience of other clinicians is that they are denied because tic disorders are not considered a permanent disability, yet even adults we work with - that clearly have tics that have persisted into adulthood and that experiencing significant functional impairment - are also being told that their disability is not a permanent disability and denied funding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year the Tourette Syndrome Association of Australia holds an Awareness Week (June 1-7 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the theme is \"Understand the Impact\", focusing on educating the public on the condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Valsamma Eapen is Scientia Professor and Chair of Child Psychiatry at UNSW Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says while it requires a comprehensive care plan to look after people living with tics, sometimes, even health professionals don't have much awareness of what's needed to support their patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"GPs are usually the first stop, but could also be paediatrics in neurology, psychology, and some will go to the eye specialist if the fast tic is blinking or screwing of the eye, or ENT specialist when they have a vocal tic like grunting or throat-clearing and so on. But often it's not picked up as tics or Tourette, better understanding is critical as currently caught between two main worldviews. One is, oh, tics not to worry, they'll grow out of it. Or Oh, is that the swearing syndrome where people blurt out the obscenities? You don't swear so you can't have Tourette, right? Neither is a helpful approach because the majority would fall somewhere in between.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Eapen calls for more training for professionals, while urging the government to launch a national guideline on Tourette Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A national guideline will provide uniform minimum standards and a consistent approach that's agreed upon by all consumer stakeholders, professionals as to the framework to awareness, early identification, comprehensive assessment, and also matching supports. And that should also include accommodations at school and for disability supports where it is applicable. It is indeed a human rights issue for the 55,000 Australians who are living with Tourettes.\"\n\n\n\n",

Our defense spending must reflect the dangers and threats that we face today. Because deterrence doesn't come on the cheap, just ask the American taxpayer. Time is of the essence. We must step up and move out with urgency. And it's hard to believe a little bit, after some trips to Europe that I'm saying this, but thanks to President Trump, Asian allies should look to countries in Europe as a newfound example.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New South Wales government and the state's rail union have struck a deal in the Fair Work Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing almost a year of industrial action disputes between the union and state government over pay conditions, the deal gets workers a 12 per cent pay rise over three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rail, Tram and Bus Union initially sought a 32 per cent pay rise over four years and a 35-hour working week, while the government offered a 15 per cent figure over the same time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransport Minister John Graham told the ABC the result is a win for his government, labelling it a \"fair and reasonable\" wage rise they had promised to deliver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the reasons this deal has landed is that we were one per cent apart when it came to the February negotiations. The government has paid that full one percent to land this deal, we see that as a fair arrangement, it's an investment in reliability. We need a more reliable train service in Sydney, and working with the workforce rather than fighting against them is how we do that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nEleven Sudanese migrants and a Libyan driver have been killed in a car crash.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's understood the accident between the migrants\u2019 vehicle and a truck happened in the desert, 90 kilometres north of the Libyan town of Kufra.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the latest deadly incident involving Sudanese migrants in the Libyan desert.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, seven Sudanese were found dead after their vehicle broke down in the desert on a path used by traffickers between Chad and Libya, stranding 34 migrants on board for several days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexei Popyrin has reached the final 16 at the French Open for the first time after beating Portuguese Nuno Borges in a three hour match.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's now the last Australian man standing after the shock early exit of Alex de Minaur.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s number two ranked player is yet to lose a set on his way to the quarter finals.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says his aim ahead of his next match with American 12th seed Tommy Paul is to keep his mind on his own game.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "At first glance, it seems aimed at the wealthy \u2014 but Labor's superannuation tax plan may have a much broader impact, according to some economists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan, one of the government's key economic policies, is expected to be presented in parliament in the coming months and is proposed to take effect from the start of the next financial year, 1 July.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will hit those with more than $3 million in their superannuation accounts with an extra 15 per cent tax, on top of the 15 per cent all super fund members are currently taxed on their earnings.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The super tax that slipped under the radar during the election campaign\n\n'More and more people will be affected'\n\nThe 30 per cent tax could directly impact 80,000 people, or less than 0.5 per cent of individuals, by 2025-26, according to the Treasury.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this number may increase as people add more money to their super accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The $3 million threshold is set; it won't be indexed or increased over time unless the government announces that. So over time, more and more people will be affected by the tax,\" Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If superannuation returns may remain positive and your fund keeps going up in value ... more and more people will fall over the threshold and be subject to the tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a lot of people who [are] sort of halfway through their career ... They could quite easily hit the threshold within the next 10 years if it's not indexed. And that can have a negative impact.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot indexing the $3 million threshold means it won't increase with inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with The Conversation's Politics podcast, Treasurer Jim Chalmers appeared to indicate the government may choose to raise the threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are so many instances in the tax system where thresholds aren\u2019t indexed, and from time to time governments take decisions to raise those thresholds. I\u2019m anticipating that that\u2019s what would happen here,\" he said.\n\n\n\n'It could affect average Australians'\n\nWhen the plan was introduced in 2023, Treasury said that since most super fund members are unaffected, it aims to \"avoid imposing significant system and reporting changes that could indirectly affect others\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some economists are concerned about the potential impacts of the super tax on the broader economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOliver said the policy \"could affect average Australians\" while \"in theory, there's no impact on those who have less than $3 million\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Tax time countdown: Six things you should start doing now\n\n\"What could happen, though, is that people who are close to it or are beyond the threshold, might think, well, I better start rearranging my superannuation such that I'm not exposed to this tax,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means I take some ... out of the superannuation fund I have, or I put my investments into other parts of the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So there's potentially less investment in the broader economy that could adversely affect economic growth and therefore affect living standards in Australia at a time when we actually want to boost economic growth and boost living standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are all sorts of complications associated with this, which could have unintended consequences for the broader economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Australian Taxation Office figures from 2021, the average super balances for men and women aged between 60 and 64 were $402,838 and $318,203 respectively.\n\n\n\nHow will the housing market be impacted?\n\nOne of the consequences of the super tax, which has been at the centre of the debate, is its potential impact on housing .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tax will cover unrealised capital gains \u2014 meaning people could be taxed each year on the rising paper value of assets like property in a self-managed super fund (SMSF), even if they haven't sold them.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicola Powell, chief of research and economics at Domain, told SBS News this could affect the makeup of property investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is the first time paper gains have been taxed in this way and not the realised earnings. So in essence, it's edging into new territories,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia's new regional hotspot for city leavers as Sunshine Coast slips\n\nShe said that this may lead to SMSFs shifting from the residential market to commercial property, potentially affecting the housing market for both renters and homeowners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that what it could do is increase the number of homes for sale. It could increase the number of residential property listings and ultimately [lead to] fewer rental listings,\" Powell explained.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe believes the outcome may be similar to a potential removal of negative gearing .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The research that's been done for negative gearing does show that removal of the negative gearing will increase rents, but it will increase home ownership and reduce property prices. But the bigger impact is [that] it does increase rent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You could argue that a similar outcome could come from this type of policy, too.\"\n\n\n\n'Makes the system a bit fairer'\n\nOliver said: \"There are many Australians who use their self-managed super funds to invest in startups that could be small businesses or business ideas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a concern that with those startups that there might be less money available for start-up capital from SMSF funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that the issue is not so much an objection to making the system fairer: Yes. Make it fairer, but do it in a way that doesn't create lots of complications.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid the criticism, Chalmers has defended Labor's policy, saying it \"will help us fund our priorities, whether it\u2019s Medicare, the tax cuts, and other priorities in budget repair\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know that people have views about it. I know there's a campaign in a couple of our newspapers about it. But this is all about making sure that it's still concessional treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It makes the system a bit fairer and it's important in terms of the sustainability of the budget.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Apart from trying to show that he still has some, albeit more limited, authority to act on tariffs, Trump\u2019s announcement, to a rally of US steelworks, had a secondary purpose. Loading During last year\u2019s election campaign, Trump was vehemently opposed to a proposed $US15 billion ($23.3 billion) acquisition of US Steel by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel \u2013 as was Joe Biden, who blocked the deal only days before he left office. Both were chasing the votes of steelworkers and their powerful union in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered and has its major plants. Having won the election, however, Trump has had a change of mind.\n\nWhile the US will impose some significant conditions on the deal \u2013 including, perhaps, a \u201cgolden share\u201d that would give the government a veto over major decisions along with a commitment from Nippon Steel to appoint a US chief executive and a majority of Americans to the board \u2013 it now appears that he will approve the deal, even though he says he hasn\u2019t seen its final details. Nippon Steel, one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated steel producers, has promised to invest about $US14 billion in US Steel\u2019s operations, which have been struggling, shrinking and suffering from under-investment for decades. Trump\u2019s doubling of the tariff rate for steel and aluminium is a way of justifying the decision to approve the deal, as well as enhancing the economics of US Steel and other US steelmakers and helping to underwrite Nippon Steel\u2019s massive investments, most of which will occur over the next four years. Trump\u2019s original tariffs on steel and aluminium infuriated America\u2019s trade partners, including Australia, even though Australia\u2019s exports of those metals to the US are quite modest. Canada, whose steel exports represent about a quarter of US steel imports and half its aluminium imports, has far more at stake.\n\nMexico, Brazil, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan and European nations will also be impacted, with Canada and the European Union already threatening retaliation, as they did in response to Trump\u2019s initial 25 per cent tariffs. Australia is still, probably fruitlessly, seeking an exemption. Loading The decision to allow the Nippon Streel deal to proceed, if that is the outcome, is good policy. The US steel industry is small \u2013 about half the size it was half a century ago \u2013 and has been shrinking. It has poor profitability and ageing technology. Nippon Steel\u2019s investment and its technologies can arrest that decline. The decision to double the tariffs on steel \u2013 indeed the original decision to impose the 25 per cent tariff \u2013 is, however, poor policy. It will increase investment in the sector, and will probably improve its profitability, plant utilisation rates and employment numbers. But that will come at a significant cost.\n\nIn 2018, when Trump first imposed tariffs on imported steel, steel prices rose almost 10 per cent, the sector\u2019s profits rose by about $US2.5 billion, capacity utilisation jumped from 74 per cent to about 80 per cent and nearly 10,000 jobs were added within the sector. The impact was quite short-lived, with those numbers subsequently reversing as the industry resumed its long-term decline. The initial impact was predictable. Tariffs are protectionist. They protect domestic industries and companies from more efficient producers elsewhere by boosting their sales, margins and profits. That\u2019s what happened after the 2018 tariffs. Loading They come, however, at a cost to the customers of the protected industries, which is also what happened after Trump\u2019s 2018 tariffs were imposed. A Peterson Institute for International Economics study concluded that the 2018 tariffs cost US downstream steel-using industries about $US5.6 billion, or about $US650,000 for each new job they added in the steel sector. The US Federal Reserve Board concluded that they cost about 75,000 jobs in those downstream industries, or more than eight times the number of jobs added by the steelmakers.",

    "text": "Perruzza said he was seeing an increasing number of properties selling through private sale rather than at auction. Loading \u201cSales are being made, but auctions are very hit and miss,\u201d he said. A nearby home, 4 Maryville Street in Ripponlea, also failed to secure any bids at auction. Listed with a price range of $2.875 million to $3.15 million, the four-bedroom, renovated home is located in the coveted Brunning estate.\n\n\u201cIt is a tightly held suburb, so it\u2019s not very often you get the opportunity to buy a block this big,\u201d said lead agent Rachael O\u2019Connor from McGrath Estate Agents St Kilda. While one registered bidder was at the auction, O\u2019Connor said they didn\u2019t make a bid and declined to negotiate privately afterwards. O\u2019Connor had been hopeful that more stock would come onto the market in the area after the federal election, but that has not happened. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the lowest levels of quality stock I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two homes were among 1417 scheduled auctions across Melbourne over the past week. By Saturday evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 70.3 per cent from 1048 reported results, while 105 auctions were withdrawn. Loading Separate figures from Cotality, formerly CoreLogic, found Melbourne home values rose 0.4 per cent in May. Louis Christopher, the general manager and head of research at SQM, cautioned against hastily interpreting the week\u2019s auction results, as they were affected by a surge in auction volume due to coming King\u2019s Birthday long weekend. \u201cThe amount of auction stock substantially increased from last week; it\u2019s in excess of 30 per cent since,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLong weekends are usually quiet on the auction front, and if sellers realise that their auction date falls on a long weekend, they often bring the date forward, which is why we see this spike.\u201d In Chelsea, a 1920s period weatherboard home sold $255,000 over the reserve, for $1.505 million. The home at 32 Catherine Street had a price guide of $1.18 million to $1.22 million, with a reserve of $1.25 million. There is no legal requirement for a vendor\u2019s reserve to be in line with their property\u2019s price guide. Lead agent Ruben Gueli from Ray White Chelsea, said the result \u201ceclipsed expectations\u201d.\n\nLoading There were 10 registered bidders, six of whom were active in the auction. \u201cThe proceedings kicked off with a bang,\u201d Gueli said. \u201cThe opening bid came in $110,000 above the top of the price range. This shocked everyone and really set the tone for the rest of the competitive auction.\u201d The auction finale was a tussle between two couples who were drawn to the beachside location and quality renovation.\n\n\u201cThey were going bid for bid, but it was ultimately sold to a young couple starting a family,\u201d Gueli said. The sellers had owned the property for 10 years, one of whom was Ray White Judd White director Andrew Dimashki. In Footscray, a three-bedroom period home passed in at auction but sold in private negotiation for $865,000 afterwards. The home at 68 Essex Street was listed with a price guide of $800,000 to its reserve price of $870,000.",

    "text": "The end of the regular season means it\u2019s time for some uncomfortable truths. Despite the perceived performance benefits of cutting the Rebels, the four remaining Australian sides have actually won fewer games against the Kiwis this year. They have won seven this year compared to nine last year, with the discrepancy explained by both the Reds and Brumbies flipping from a 3-2 trans-Tasman winning record in 2024 to a 2-3 losing one. While the early-season narrative was one of Australian improvement, it quietly flipped about two-thirds of the way through the competition, and the last win against a New Zealand team was the Reds\u2019 victory against the Blues in round 11. It\u2019s an obvious concern on the eve of the British and Lions series.\n\nTwo-tier Super has a problem\n\nThe win-loss record outline above is part of a much broader problem. The top six finishers this year are effectively the same top six teams from the past four years of Super Rugby Pacific. In fact, in the competition\u2019s history (beginning in 2022) only eight teams have finished in the top six, the Waratahs sneaking in twice (6th in 2023 and 6th in 2022) and the Highlanders sneaking in once (6th in 2024). It\u2019s a competition with bedded-in haves and have-nots, as the points differential from this year highlights again. The big six all have positive points differentials, and the rest have deeply negative ones, with the Highlanders the \u2018best\u2019 at minus 90. This is one reason why this column has been sympathetic towards Dan McKellar at the Waratahs this year. He\u2019s walked into a job in the current have-nots, and Super Rugby\u2019s lack of player movement makes upward mobility very hard to achieve.",
