    "text": "A drug already approved for cancer treatment could now help treat a deadly childhood cancer, Australian research has revealed.\n\nNeuroblastoma is a tumour that develops from nerve cells glands above the kidneys, or along the spine, chest and abdomen; it occurs commonly in children, and is deadly in nine out of 10 cases when children relapse.\n\nThis is most common in high-risk neuroblastoma, where 15 per cent of children do not respond to treatment, and half of those who do respond initially will see their cancer return.\n\nNeuroblastoma is a deadly cancer that can affect children as young as two-years-old. (Garvan Institute)\n\nThis is because standard drugs used in chemotherapy rely on the same cellular switch, called the JNK pathway, to kill the cancer cells.\n\nIn relapsed tumours, the JNK cells can stop working, making treatments ineffective and causing the tumours to spread with deadly consequences.\n\n\"The statistics once patients get to that point are devastating for families,\" Associate Professor David Croucher said.\n\nHowever, researchers at the Garvan Institute have found a drug called romidepsin can help reduce tumour growth and the chances of the deadly cancer returning, helping more children survive.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia Post reveals deadline for mailing Christmas parcels\n\nThe drug is already approved to treat other cancers like lymphomas, and the result of the study published in Science Advances is promising, according to researchers.\n\n\"This represents a big step forward,\" Croucher said.\n\n\"By finding drugs that don't depend on the JNK pathway, we can still trigger cancer cell death even when this usual route is blocked.\"\n\nThe trials were conducted on animal models, and the next step is to use clinical trials.\n\nCrocuher insists the benefits will be of the families who could be helped fight the devastating disease.\n\n\"Behind every statistic is someone's loved one,\" Croucher said. \"Understanding these molecular mechanisms gives us hope we can develop more effective treatments for patients and their families who currently face limited options \u2013 and that's what drives us every day.\"",

He threw himself into performing arts, played in the orchestra and sang in a choir.\n\nHe joined cadets and once even built his own computer.\n\n\"He was such a vibrant, big character,\" his mother Tamara McKenzie said.\n\nAt 15, Max lived life to the fullest.\n\nBut he was also surrounded by a constant, invisible danger.\n\nThe Melbourne teenager had a severe allergy to nuts and carried an adrenaline injector, or EpiPen.\n\nMax McKenzie has been described as a vibrant, active teenager who lived life to the fullest. (Supplied: AMAX4)\n\nOn August 6, 2021, he was forced to use it after accidentally ingesting walnuts at a relative's house.\n\nMax began displaying signs of anaphylaxis and was given further adrenaline when paramedics arrived. He suffered a seizure and, once at the Box Hill Hospital, staff performed emergency surgery to intubate him.\n\nBy the afternoon, he had suffered a severe brain injury from oxygen deprivation.\n\nHe was transferred to the Alfred Hospital and died 13 days later after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nFamily feels 'completely let down'\n\nFour years on, a Victorian coroner is examining if Max's death was preventable and whether paramedics and doctors at the Box Hill Hospital provided appropriate care.\n\nOn the final day of the inquest, Max's devastated parents stepped into the witness box.\n\nHis mother said she felt \"completely let down by our health care system\".\n\nMs McKenzie told the court that as Max was loaded into the ambulance, he said he was going to die.\n\n\"I naively told him he wasn't,\" she said.\n\n\" I now must live with knowing I got that so wrong. \"\n\nMax McKenzie's parents, Ben and Tamara McKenzie, say their family has been let down by the health care system. (Supplied: AMAX4)\n\nShe described \"complete chaos\" in the hospital cubicle as staff decided on the best way to treat him.\n\nMax's father, Ben McKenzie, an emergency doctor, rushed from South Melbourne and found himself helping to resuscitate his own son.\n\n\"I should never have had an opportunity to treat Max in any way because it should have been done before I got there,\" he said.\n\nAllergies on the rise\n\nNearly one in three Australians \u2014 about eight million people \u2014 now have some form of allergic disease, according to research published in August.\n\nAllergies can be mild or life-changing, and can appear in many forms, including asthma, hayfever, eczema or reactions to food, medication and insect bites.\n\nIn a report, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy and the National Allergy Council found the diseases cost the Australian health system and economy $18.9 billion in 2024.\n\n\"We are known as the global capital of allergic disease,\" said Sarah Emery, the head of support group Allergy & Anaphylaxis Australia.\n\n\"I don't think that there's one specific factor that can be pointed to \u2026 they're all really speculatory.\"\n\nDeadly cases like Max's are rare but not isolated.\n\nJames Tsindos coronial inquest James Tsindos, 17, was unaware the food he ordered from an online app contained nuts before he died from anaphylaxis, a Victorian coroner has heard.\n\nThe Murdoch Children's Research Institute estimates about 20 Australians die from anaphylaxis each year and more than 12,000 are hospitalised.\n\nTwo months before Max's death, Melbourne teenager James Tsindos died after eating a takeaway burrito bowl containing cashews.\n\nHis case remains under investigation, with the coroner considering whether restaurants and food delivery apps need stronger warnings.\n\nMs Emery says awareness and food labelling have improved in recent years, but more progress is needed. Consumers also need confidence to ask questions.\n\n\"We have a saying to our consumers, 'Always ask, always tell',\" she said.\n\nShe believes the health system is generally well prepared to treat severe reactions, crediting the Acute Anaphylaxis Clinical Care Standard introduced in 2021.\n\nThe guidelines call for anaphylaxis to be detected quickly, adrenaline to be injected without delay and to be kept on hand for further use, patients to be laid flat on their backs, constant clinical observation, and a comprehensive discharge plan.\n\nCould Max's death have been prevented?\n\nThe inquest heard that in some instances, allergic reactions were simply overwhelming even with rapid medical intervention.\n\nWhether Max's case falls into that category is up to the coroner to decide.\n\nLawyers for the McKenzie family argued Max was \"robbed\" due to \"substandard care\" from paramedics and delays at the Box Hill Hospital.\n\nBut others do not see it in such black and white terms.\n\nAn expert panel was divided on whether Max's death was preventable after the walnuts were ingested.\n\nTamara McKenzie told the inquest the response at the hospital was chaotic, while Ben McKenzie gave evidence about having to help resuscitate his own son. (ABC News: Kristian Silva)\n\nLawyers representing Eastern Health, which oversees the Box Hill Hospital, backed their staff and called criticism \"unfair\".\n\n\"The chance of death was high, irrespective of his treatment course,\" Eastern Health barrister Sebastian Reid said.\n\nDr David Armstrong and Dr Stephen Rashford believed Max could not have been saved.\n\nDr Andrew Numa said the death was \"potentially preventable\".\n\nParamedic Tony Hucker did not give an opinion but agreed the \"best care\" wasn't provided.\n\nOnce Max reached Box Hill Hospital, the experts agreed that intubation was crucial \u2014 and that it took too long.\n\nProfessor Armstrong argued that treatment was \"always trying to catch up\".\n\nProfessor Numa said a 10-minute delay \"sealed\" Max's fate.\n\n\"I think he was denied the best opportunity for survival. He arrived at Box Hill Hospital with a pulse,\" he said.\n\n\"He had a compromised airway, and the delay in addressing that made his situation irretrievable.\"\n\nThe inquest heard there were delays intubating Max McKenzie at Box Hill Hospital. (ABC News: Patrick Rocca)\n\nA barrister assisting the coroner, Rachel Ellyard, also said there was an \"unreasonable delay\" in intubating Max, but noted that his condition was so severe that a different response was unlikely to have saved him.\n\nThe McKenzie family's barrister, Stanley Wallace, criticised Ambulance Victoria because one of the first paramedics on scene was a graduate who needed extra guidance and was not qualified to drive under \"Code One\" conditions.\n\nBut Ambulance Victoria's barrister, Naomi Hodgson, said paramedics' decisions were appropriate in a \"rapidly evolving situation\".

    "text": "Pianist Sarah Milnes thinks there are good reasons why kids should learn how to play an instrument.\n\nMost obviously, she says, it helps them unlock the joys of music.\n\nThere are proven links between music education and cognitive development \u2014 from language and memory to reading and maths.\n\nThe standards applied by Australia's top music exams body are coming into focus. ( )\n\nBut, simply, Ms Milnes believes learning how to play an instrument makes children better people.\n\n\"Music gives you a lot of grounding,\" Ms Milnes says.\n\n\" I think it's a skill that you can carry through your life. \"\n\nA golden crown slipping?\n\nIt's for those reasons Ms Milnes enrolled her daughter, Evelyn, in violin classes a few years ago.\n\nThe family lives in the farming town of Mount Barker, about 360 kilometres south of Perth, and travels to the port city of Albany, 50km away, for Evelyn's lessons.\n\n\"There is a bit of a finger in the back in terms of getting her to practise for now,\" Ms Milnes jokes.\n\nSarah Milnes has enrolled her daughter into violin lessons in Albany. ( )\n\nThey live in a region with a nationally recognised string instrument program, with more than 350 students learning the violin, viola or cello.\n\nEvelyn, Ms Milnes says, is \"learning very well\".\n\nSo well that she is being assessed by a body called the Australian Music Examination Board (AMEB), considered to be the gold standard of music testing across the country.\n\nBut Ms Milnes worries its standards are eroding.\n\n\"The standard that the AMEB has always upheld itself to be, and I've always had faith in \u2026 is slipping,\" she says.\n\n\"I think that if those standards are not upheld, then what's the point of doing these big exams that involve preparing for hours and hours?\"\n\nMike Hyder has been teaching students the violin for 30 years in Albany. ( )\n\nLearning to play an instrument is linked with better neurological development. ( )\n\nAt the heart of such concerns are what parents like Ms Milnes and some music teachers say is a growing divide between city and regional students.\n\nMike Hyder is a music tutor in Albany, where he has specialised in teaching students string instruments such as the violin for three decades.\n\nMike Hyder says it's not unusual for the AMEB to send generalist examiners to assess students sitting its exams, but he argues it's typically only been done for beginner and lower grades. ( )\n\nMr Hyder claims the AMEB has been sending general examiners from Perth to assess high-level students who require a very specialised treatment.\n\nMr Hyder says it's not unusual for the AMEB to send generalist examiners to assess students sitting its exams, but he argues it's typically only been done for beginner and lower grades.\n\nA music education involves more than merely learning how to play an instrument. ( )\n\nSome regional parents and teachers say the testing of late has hit discordant notes. ( )\n\nThere are chamber orchestras right across Australia. ( )\n\nA generalist examiner, he notes, may not even be able to play the instrument they are supposed to be assessing.\n\n\"We all say our instrument is the hardest instrument,\" Mr Hyder says.\n\n\" But unless you are a player, you really cannot understand what it takes to play at a high level on the violin. \"\n\nMr Hyder is particularly aggrieved at the use of a generalist to examine some of his own students, something which he says has rocked their confidence.\n\nHe now wants a reassessment of their marks.\n\nMr Hyder says regional students still have to pay the full cost of an exam even though they might not get a specialist assessor.\n\nAnd he says those costs are not immaterial to many families \u2014 amounting to almost $200 for a seventh-grade exam.\n\n\"It concerns me that there may be a double standard here,\" he says.\n\nMusic board defiant\n\nGaby Gunders, the chief examiner for the AMEB in Western Australia, disputes any suggestion that generalist examiners are not up to the task of assessing students at higher levels.\n\nGaby Gunders says the AMEB strives to give the best and fairest exams. ( )\n\nShe argues generalist examiners are often among the board's most capable operators who have had more extensive training.\n\n\"[Being] a generalist doesn't make them lesser,\" Dr Gunders says.\n\nAccording to Dr Gunders, the board conducts about 5,000 exams in WA every year, and is the only branch of the organisation to send examiners to regional areas.\n\nShe says the AMEB has to weigh various factors, such as the number of students in each instrumental category, when deciding which examiner to send to a regional town.\n\n\"The only people that we would choose for that pool of regional exams are people who have got a cross-instrument experience,\" she explains.\n\n\"Then they go through our cross-instrument training beyond that.\"\n\nSome say the AMEB can make or break an aspiring musician's chances depending on its scores. ( )\n\nEisteddfods are an important stepping stone for many aspiring musicians. ( )\n\nUltimately, however, Dr Gunders says the AMEB is limited in the services it can provide because sending multiple specialists to a regional town would cost too much money.\n\n\"If we had to send three examiners, that would regrettably be the end of our examining in that region, because we couldn't do it,\" she says.\n\n\" There's no way that we could afford, as an organisation, to run and afford to send three examiners for a session because there are those higher grades. \"\n\nA question of faith\n\nMr Hyder acknowledges the board faces practical constraints but argues it could do more to support higher-grade students in the regions.\n\nHe says the AMEB process is rightly held to be one of the most rigorous in the world.\n\nMr Hyder says good marks in the AMEB exams can be the difference between a student gaining entry into tertiary music education \u2014 and a possible career in the field \u2014 or not.\n\nFor many talented musicians, the AMEB is a path they follow to succeed in the field. ( )\n\nStudents spend years preparing for upper grade AMEB tests. ( )\n\nEach year, about 5,000 music exams are run by the AMEB in Western Australia. ( )\n\n\"It's a very hard exam, but the kids really prosper if they do well in an AMEB exam,\" Mr Hyder says.\n\nMs Milnes, whose daughter Evelyn recently sat the AMEB's second-grade exam, agrees.\n\nShe wants her daughter to follow the path laid out by the board to achieve excellence in her instrument and all of the benefits of a lifetime of music.\n\nIn order for that goal to endure, however, Ms Milnes says their faith in the AMEB cannot be broken.\n\n\"I think that is the most important part,\" Ms Milnes says.",

I learned so much because I'm still new to the sport,\" McRae said.\n\nWhat is coastal rowing?\n\nRowing Australia's interim lead coach for the sport, Michael Russell, described the sport as an \"extreme version\" of rowing.\n\n\"It's sort of the three-by-three basketball equivalent in rowing, taking the 2,000-metre course and putting it on a beach and making it more exciting for spectators,\" he said.\n\n\"The athletes need rowing and running ability \u2026 they can be rowing in seas up to half a metre, so they need to be able to steer the boat in those conditions as well.\"\n\nCalli McRae, alongside Samuel Forbes, won their race in a time of 2:32:63. (Supplied: Commonwealth Rowing Association/Swift Racing Boats/CJ Taylor Photos)\n\nThough the sport has two events, an endurance race and a sprint, the sprint was the focus in Barbados, with the Australian team managing to take home six gold medals out of the seven events they competed in.\n\nIt includes a sprint down the beach to the water, with athletes then hopping in a boat to row a short distance on a slalom course, before running the boat back up the beach and sprinting to the finish line.\n\nThe sport has solo categories, as well as mixed doubles and quads.\n\n\"It's currently the only international event for rowing that has mixed crews,\" Mr Russell said.\n\nIn Barbados, the Australian team took home six gold medals out of the seven events they competed in.

(ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nStatements to the ABC from the federal government about whether they would commit to funding a new RDH have so far been vague and noncommittal.\n\nMaybe it's time for some political bravery in the Northern Territory government.\n\nProjects such as the ship lift and the State Square building (projects, it must be said, that were signed off on under the previous Labor government) remain publicly divisive and will only benefit certain portions of the territory population.\n\nA new RDH would benefit all NT residents for generations to come.",

    "text": "In the months after giving birth to her second baby, Ali Gossage felt an all-consuming anger that came out of nowhere.\n\nShe did not know it at the time, but was suffering a condition many mothers go through, but few talk about.\n\n\"I developed postpartum rage. It was something that I'd never experienced before and never heard of before,\" she said.\n\n\"I would blackout [with] rage, throw things, and it would literally be over the most minute, tiny thing.\n\n\"My son would ask me for a drink, and I would just absolutely go off the rocker.\"\n\nAli Gossage says she was nervous to talk to her husband about how she was feeling after having their second baby. (Supplied: Ali Gossage)\n\nMrs Gossage said she had no idea what was happening to her as she had not experienced any mental health struggles after having her first baby the year before.\n\nThe now 28-year-old said she did not feel comfortable talking to anyone about how she was feeling because she did not want people to think she could not handle being a mother.\n\n\"I was really hesitant to speak out about it because I didn't know what I was going to be met with on the other side,\" she said.\n\n\"How do you talk to someone [about how] ... you just don't know what you're going to do in that moment? You're just not the person you really are, when you snap.\n\n\"It was really terrifying.\"\n\nStigma remains\n\nGidget Foundation clinical psychologist Katie Peterson said, unfortunately, a lot of new mothers struggled with their mental health, and those suffering postpartum rage often felt like they could not talk about the reality of their situation.\n\nClinical psychologist Katie Peterson says being able to hear people's stories and feeling validated is important. (Supplied: Katie Peterson)\n\n\"Often they feel like they're failing as a mum, or it might not be the experience they'd hoped for in becoming a new parent,\" she said.\n\n\"So reaching out for support or knowing where to get support can be really hard.\"\n\nMrs Gossage said opening up about postpartum rage was still heavily stigmatised, despite the condition's prevalence.\n\n\"Everyone just talks about how great motherhood is and 'this is all I've ever wanted' and 'I love my babies' and everything is hunky dory,\" she said.\n\n\"I have three older sisters and two of them have kids, and when I was going through it, I asked them, 'Was it hard for you? Did you experience anything like the isolation, the identity shift of becoming a mother?'\"\n\n\"And they were like, 'Oh yeah, we did, but no-one spoke about it, so we just got on with it.'\"\n\nAli Gossage and her firstborn son, Harrison. (Supplied: Ali Gossage)\n\nOpen conversations crucial\n\nMs Peterson said telehealth appointments and speaking to healthcare professionals were always an option for struggling parents.\n\nBut having open, honest conversations was crucial too.\n\n\"Peer support is becoming a lot more common and is a really important part of breaking down the stigma around accessing mental health,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that isolation and loneliness with these types of challenges is one of the things that makes them worse, so being able to hear people's stories and feel validated is really important.\"\n\nAli Gossage hopes to use her story to show other mums they are not alone. (Supplied: Ali Gossage)\n\nFor Mrs Gossage, sharing her story with an online mothers' support group called Motherland and eventually getting regular counselling through the Gidget Foundation had turned her life around.\n\nNow the young mother wanted to show other mothers that they did not have to struggle through the traumas of postpartum mental health alone.\n\n\"I know that it's scary and [you are] vulnerable and you do feel like a failure when you ask for help,\" Mrs Gossage said.\n\n\" But it's so common, and you just need to, because it really does take a village to raise a child. \"",

    "text": "Usman Khawaja has labelled the Perth pitch for the first Ashes Test a \"piece of shit\" in a diatribe that could attract attention from Cricket Australia.\n\nJust a day after the ICC gave the Perth Stadium wicket full marks with its highest possible rating of \"very good\", Khawaja pulled no punches on the state of the pitch for the two-day Ashes opener.\n\nNineteen wickets fell on the first day in the England match, after 17 were also taken between Australia and India on day one of the Perth Test last year.\n\nSpeaking at a fundraising lunch for his foundation in Brisbane, Khawaja sarcastically said: '\"Nineteen wickets on the first day and about 20 people got hit. That's a great wicket, that seems real fair.\n\n\"The same thing happened last year in the India Test. It's just that day-one wicket, the ball just does not react.\n\n\"Steve Smith's by far the best cricketer I've ever played with, and he's missing the middle of his bat by a long way.\n\n\"He does not miss the middle of his bat, [but] he's getting hit in the elbow.\n\n\" So, day-one wicket at Perth is a piece of shit, I'm happy to say that. Has been last year, it was this year. \"\n\nLast week's Ashes series opener lasted just 847 balls, with only a 1932-33 Test against South Africa at the MCG lasting less time for a result in Australia.\n\nEngland's batting has been labelled reckless and \"brainless\" by former England opener Geoffrey Boycott, with the all-out aggressive approach at threat of losing its appeal, although Australia's first innings of 132 was the lowest total in the game and was saved in its chase by the uber-aggressive Travis Head.\n\nBack spasms forced Khawaja from the field for long periods of the first Test. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\nBut Khawaja was adamant the Perth pitch was still not good enough, with the 38-year-old's main issue being variable bounce.\n\n\"You can't really predict up and down. Up and down is the hardest. Sideways is a little bit easier,\" Khawaja said.\n\n\"But up and down, your hands can't catch up.\n\n\"They do get better. Day two, day three, and then day four, they start to crack up and cure again.\n\n\"So whenever we play at Perth, it's one of the few places we win the toss, bat first, hoping that we can bat again maybe at the end of day two and into day three.\"\n\nCricket Australia defended the pitch, adamant during the week that the \"very good\" rating justified their belief the wicket created a \"fair balance between bat and ball\".\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nKhawaja's comments came after player of the match Mitchell Starc and former opening partner David Warner said last week that Australia's players wanted the Test summer to start at the Gabba in Brisbane.\n\nPerth is locked in to host Australia's first Test of next summer as well when New Zealand tour, before Adelaide is expected to take on the role in 2027-28. The opener is set to return to Brisbane after the Olympics in 2032.\n\nKhawaja's back spasms meant he was unable to open for Australia in either innings in Perth, allowing for Head to score a match-winning century in the fourth-innings chase.\n\nKhawaja is confident he will be fit to play in Brisbane with his back having improved, while also insisting he had paid no attention to calls for him to be dropped from the side and Head moved to open full time.\n\nKhawaja has only passed 50 twice and averages under 30 in 27 innings since January 2024, which includes a record 232 in the opening Test in Sri Lanka earlier this year.\n\nThe Queenslander has retained his spot in the 14-player squad for the day-night Gabba Test, but there is still the potential for Head to stay up the order with Jake Weatherald and Josh Inglis or Beau Webster to move into the middle order.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

    "text": "Buying a home is the biggest financial investment most people will make, and is seen by many as a major milestone on the road to adulthood.\n\nBut it's a decision that requires extensive research and preparation before making a purchase.\n\n\"Buying a first home is exciting but can also be emotionally charged, and there are many important details both before and after the purchase that deserve attention,\" financial advisor Stephanie Yeung says.\n\nSo how do you know if you're ready to take on the big commitment?\n\nFriends combine finances to buy dream home together Friends Gem and Renata have saved money buying a home together with their respective families in Wollongong, and say the pay-off goes much further.\n\nWe asked three financial experts \u2014 Nicola Beswick, Natallia Smith and Stephanie Yeung \u2014 about the up-front and ongoing costs of buying a home and their top tips to prepare for home ownership.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nWhat are the up-front costs of buying?\n\nThe biggest hurdle to saving will be the deposit, which is often 20 per cent of the purchase price.\n\nListed house prices may not tell you the full story, though. In a competitive market, you may end up paying well above the advertised price, so that could blow out your budget from the get-go, Ms Smith says.\n\nAnd if you haven't accounted for added fees and charges, then you may want to read on.\n\nLenders Mortgage Insurance (if applicable) Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is a one-off fee the bank charges when your deposit is less than 20 per cent of your home. It's designed to protect the bank when you fail to meet repayments. You'll pay between 1 and 5 per cent of your loan amount, depending on how much deposit you have. It can often be added to your mortgage amount, rather than being paid up-front, but you will then pay interest on that amount too. Stamp duty Stamp duty, also known as transfer duty or land transfer duty, is the tax you pay on a property purchase. The costs vary from state to state, ranging between 3 and 5 per cent of the value of the home. Depending on where you live, you may be able to receive a concession or exemption when you buy your first home. Conveyancing fees You will usually need to hire a solicitor or conveyancer to walk you through the legal process, conduct title searches, and draft up documents such as a contract of sale and memorandum of transfer. Costs range between $800 and $2,500, but can increase with the complexity of the sale. Building and pest inspection If you want to be confident in the quality and safety of the home you're buying, you will need to pay for a building inspection. The location and size of the space, as well as whether it's a house or apartment, will determine how much you will pay. Costs range anywhere between $250 and $1,000. It's important to note that a building inspection report generally does not include a cost estimate of any repairs required. You can make your offer conditional on a building inspection being completed. Keep in mind that if you're buying at auction, your purchase is usually unconditional, so you may need to pay for an inspection before buying.\n\nLastly, you may also want to set aside some money for the fun stuff.\n\n\"Don't forget other things like the new furniture, white ware, or other items you may want to add to your home,\" Ms Beswick says.\n\n\"They are the best part of buying a place, especially when you want to make it your own!\"\n\nNicola Beswick says budgeting is key in managing the costs of home ownership. ( )\n\nWhat grants are available to home owners?\n\n\"Grants can make a world of difference if you are eligible for them,\" Ms Beswick says.\n\nHere are some schemes available on the market.\n\nFirst Home Owner Grant (FHOG)\n\nAustralian Government 5% Deposit Scheme\n\nFirst Home Super Saver Scheme (FHSS)\n\nSweeping changes to the first home buyer scheme explained The revamped scheme has come into effect, with first home buyers of all income levels now able to purchase a property with only a 5 per cent deposit. Here are the changes explained.\n\nThe FHOG provides a one-time payment to those buying a new or extensively renovated home.\n\nHowever, the grant amount varies from state to state, and the value of the property must not exceed the stipulated cap.\n\n\"The Australian Government 5% Deposit Scheme allows first home buyers to, as the name suggests, pay only a 5 per cent deposit on their first home while avoiding LMI,\" Ms Beswick explains.\n\nThe First Home Super Saver Scheme allows you to save for a home deposit through superannuation, where tax rates are generally capped.\n\nStates may also offer other schemes where the government can own a percentage of your home, so it helps to check local sites.\n\n\"That way you can get into the market and buy your own place with a bit of help from the government,\" Ms Smith says.\n\nWhat are some ongoing costs to consider?\n\nLoan repayments on your mortgage may be the biggest line item in your budget.\n\nWhether they are taken out at a variable or fixed interest rate can affect how much you pay, though both have pros and cons.\n\n\"Locking a fixed rate gives you certainty where you'll know [for example] for five years you'll be paying the same amount of money,\" Ms Smith says.\n\nBut the challenge sets in when you come off a fixed-rate term and experience a hike.\n\n\"It's really good to fix the rates when they are low but there's no real advantage to fix them when they are high,\" Ms Smith says.\n\nNatallia Smith says the ultimate goal of home ownership should be paying off your home loan as fast as possible. ( )\n\nVariable rates are subject to fluctuations in the cash rate in Australia.\n\nFor borrowers on a variable rate, Ms Smith advises: \"Always check what your rate is because sometimes the banks are not very good at passing [cuts] on to consumers.\"\n\nWhen that happens, she says to call the bank to ask for a reduction.\n\nBut there are also plenty of costs that go beyond mortgages, Ms Beswick says.\n\nHere's what you should account for.\n\nHome and contents insurance Home and contents insurance protects your property and belongings against unfortunate events like theft and wild weather. What is covered will depend on your policy. While various factors determine how much you pay, premiums may be higher if your area is at a greater risk of natural disasters or crime. A higher excess will lower your premiums but increase your out-of-pocket expenses. Council rates Council rates are a type of tax that pays for local government services and infrastructure projects. This includes the building and maintenance of public spaces, such as libraries and parks, roads and waste management. The value of your property, which gets reviewed every two years, is a key factor in determining how much you pay. Strata fees (if applicable) Strata fees, also known as body corporate fees, only apply to apartment owners. These fees are paid into a joint fund to finance repairs and maintenance on the entire property. According to Ms Smith, payments can go as high as $10,000 to $15,000 a year. This amount also increases every year, in line with inflation. Utilities This includes all household running costs such as water, gas, power and internet. However, some states offer concessions and rebates for energy bills, so it's worth researching options in your area. Maintenance and repairs Maintenance is a cost that Ms Beswick says people often account for the least and can be difficult to predict. \"Preparing for breakdown of appliances and upkeep of your garden and building is necessary to consider,\" she says. You may find there are more repairs in the first year, Ms Smith says. \"Sometimes when you buy something you don't really know what the place looks like and what needs to be fixed until you start living in it,\" she says. Personal insurance Having personal cover, like life insurance, can help you and your family pay the mortgage in tragic circumstances. \"People often insure their belongings but forget their most important asset, the ability to earn an income,\" Ms Yeung says. \"Personal insurance options, such as income protection, total and permanent disability cover, trauma or critical illness cover, and life insurance, can work separately and/or together to provide financial support if unexpected illness, injury, or accidents occur.\"\n\nHow to know if you are financially ready to own a home\n\nWhile experts have slightly different answers, they all echo the same idea.\n\nUnderstanding your cash flow and how much savings you have are important factors.\n\n\"You're on the right track if you can cover a deposit and initial costs without depleting your non-home deposit savings,\" Ms Beswick says.\n\n\" Always expect the unexpected \u2026 as a slight mishap, such as a broken air conditioner or a leaking pipe, can throw your budget out for the month. \"\n\nShe recommends spending no more than 35 per cent of your income on mortgage repayments, insurance, rates and fees.\n\nThat should give you enough leeway to build on your emergency savings buffer while paying for other living expenses comfortably.\n\nStephanie Yeung is a big believer in having a first home that is sustainable and affordable in the long run. ( )\n\nMs Yeung notes that some people check affordability by stress testing, for example, adding 2 to 3 per cent to the current interest rate to see how higher repayments would impact the budget.\n\n\"You need to have a savings buffer that goes beyond living from pay cheque to pay cheque,\" she says.\n\nHaving at least six months' worth of income in savings is ideal, adds Ms Smith.\n\n\"It's important not to spend more than you earn,\" she says, and the same goes when purchasing your own home, as she warns home owners not to overextend their budget.\n\nMs Yeung agrees and sees this as a potential financial pitfall.\n\n\"Banks might, based on current circumstances, give people a much higher loan than what they need,\" she says.\n\n\" So people are borrowing to the limit of what they can borrow rather than what they can afford \u2014 and those are two very different things. \"\n\nHouse-sitting saved me enough to buy my own home At 42, Amna did not want to join a share house or spend all her money on rent. She turned to house-sitting to save a deposit.\n\nWhile being clear on home ownership costs can help, it's also important to understand how life plans can impact the budget.\n\n\"If a working couple plans to have a family and one of them decides to take time off [for caretaking duties], then there is actually a change in your income circumstance,\" Ms Yeung says.\n\nLastly, she warns not to cave in to emotions when making a purchase, such as the fear of missing out.\n\nHere is her advice for first home owners.\n\n\"There's no need to rush. Understanding the numbers before making a major financial commitment is important because managing repayments over time is critical,\" Ms Yeung says.\n\nYour first home doesn't have to be a dream home. Financial security often comes from reducing debt and eventually paying off your mortgage.\"\n\nNote: This information is of a general nature and does not consider your personal circumstances.

    "text": "Some Jetstar planes have been grounded due to a global recall of thousands of A320 aircraft, which are also used by Australian carriers Qantas and Virgin.\n\nThis morning, Airbus ordered immediate repairs to 6,000 of its A320 family of jets, more than half the global fleet.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the affected aircraft will be briefly grounded as airlines revert to a previous software version, industry sources have told Reuters.\n\nMore than 1,000 of the affected aircraft may be grounded longer due to hardware changes, the sources said.\n\nChaos for Jetstar passengers amid nationwide flight delays The cancellation of Jetstar flights due to an issue with Airbus A320 planes has left passengers stranded across Australia.\n\nThe repairs must be carried out before the next routine flight, according to a separate bulletin to airlines seen by Reuters, which could lead to cancellations or delays.\n\nAccording to Jetstar's website, the carrier has 56 A320s in its main fleet and another 25 operating under Jetstar Japan.\n\nIt also has five A320neo planes in its main fleet.\n\nA Jetstar spokesperson did not say how many of its planes are impacted, but said some had been immediately grounded and flights cancelled.\n\n\"Due to an issue affecting Airbus A320 operators globally, some of Jetstar's Airbus-operated flights are unable to depart at this stage,\" they said.\n\n\"Safety is our number one priority. To respond to a precautionary action from Airbus, we have cancelled some Jetstar Airways flights.\n\n\"Our teams are working on options to get customers on their way as quickly as possible, and are contacting affected customers directly.\n\n\"We will continue to provide updates.\"\n\nA Qantas spokesperson said none of its fleet had been impacted.\n\nQantas's fleet of A320 planes has not been impacted. (AAP: Paul Miller)\n\nVirgin Australia operates four A320s in Western Australia, but a spokesperson said its customers would not be affected.\n\nIn a statement, Sydney Airport said the global software outage was causing delays for some domestic Jetstar services operating from Sydney.\n\n\"We're supporting Jetstar as they work to resolve the issue, and strongly advise all Jetstar customers to check their flight status with the airline before travelling to the airport,\" it said.\n\n\"All other airlines and flights at Sydney Airport are operating as normal and are unaffected.\"\n\nThere was chaos at Melbourne Airport on Saturday morning with many travellers arriving to find their flights cancelled.\n\nTravellers at Melbourne Airport have been impacted with several Jetstar flights grounded due to urgent repairs to A320 planes. (ABC News: Natasha MacFarlane)\n\nThree Jetstar flights scheduled from Adelaide to the Gold Coast, Sydney and Cairns have also been cancelled.\n\nSidney Dekker, a Griffith University professor and former pilot, said the software fix would be \"fairly simple\" and required impacted planes to be grounded for about two hours.\n\n\"But then you also need the right expertise when the airplane is in the hangar to do the software update, and that's a little bit of a crunch,\" Dr Dekker told ABC News Breakfast.\n\n\"We've had this problem in Australia for a while \u2014 not enough aviation maintenance engineers to go around.\n\n\" Worldwide, it will reverberate for a couple of weeks before it settles. It will cause a lot of disruptions. \"\n\nThe recall could see thousands of flights delayed or cancelled across the globe. (AAP: Paul Miller)\n\nThe Civil Aviation Safety Authority told the ABC it was aware of the issue \"affecting the A320 family of aircraft globally\".\n\n\"All aircraft that are affected will need to be checked in accordance with advice issued by Airbus and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"We are in contact with major airlines and confident they are acting quickly to minimise disruptions and ensure aircraft can be returned to service safely.\"\n\nRecall linked to flight-control software issue\n\nAirbus said a recent incident involving an A320-family aircraft had revealed that solar flares may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.\n\nIndustry sources have told Reuters that the incident that triggered the unexpected repairs involved a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30.\n\nSeveral passengers were hurt following a sharp loss of altitude, and the flight had to make an emergency landing at Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe setback appears to be among the largest recalls affecting Airbus in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.\n\nSome 3,000 A320-family jets were in the air worldwide shortly after Airbus's announcement on Saturday morning.\n\nThe world's largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said some 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft would need the fix.\n\nIt said it mostly expected repairs to be completed within a day, with about two hours required for each plane.\n\nOther airlines said they would take planes briefly out of service to do the repairs, including Germany's Lufthansa, India's IndiGo, and UK-based easyJet.\n\nIndiGo says it will take its A320 planes briefly out of service to do the repairs. (Reuters: Vivek Prakash)\n\nColombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70 per cent of its fleet, around 100 jets, causing significant disruption over the next 10 days and prompting the airline to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.\n\nThere are around 11,300 A320-family jets in operation, including 6,440 of the core A320 model, which first flew in 1987.\n\nFour of the world's 10 biggest A320-family operators are major US airlines: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue and United Airlines.\n\nLaunched in 1984, the A320 was the first mainstream jetliner to introduce fly-by-wire computer controls.\n\nIt competes with the Boeing 737 MAX, which suffered a lengthy worldwide grounding after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, when faulty flight-control software pushed the planes' noses down.\n\nThe Airbus bulletin seen by Reuters traced the problem to a flight system called ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer), which sends commands from the pilot's side-stick to elevators at the rear. These, in turn, control the aircraft's pitch or nose angle.\n\nThe computer's manufacturer, France's Thales, said in response to a Reuters query that the computer complies with Airbus specifications and the functionality in question is supported by software that is not under Thales' responsibility.\n\nABC/Reuters",

    "text": "With a final decision now on the horizon, the debate over the proposed Macquarie Point stadium has grown louder and more familiar.\n\nArguments tend to focus on the $1.13 billion price tag, the \"monolithic\" scale, its place on Hobart's waterfront and whether politicians should bend to the will of a stubborn sporting body.\n\nAt the centre of all that noise is a striking, dome-shaped arena capable of hosting more than 20,000 people at elite-level sporting games and large concerts.\n\nSo, setting all the politics aside \u2014 just for a moment \u2014 what would it actually be like to visit the stadium that is being proposed for Hobart?\n\nEntering the stadium\n\nIf it gets built, the stadium would sit on a large plot of land between the River Derwent, Hobart's CBD and the Queen's Domain.\n\nIt would be plopped beside a working port, a picturesque row of heritage buildings and one of the city's busiest intersections.\n\nThe stadium would sit between the River Derwent, the Hobart CBD and the Queen's Domain. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nA wide public concourse would encircle the building, offering space for crowds to gather before attendees begin to filter through the four main entrances.\n\nThis area would be generally exposed to the elements, though wind tunnel tests suggest the comfort levels would be \"suitable\".\n\nThe most popular entrance is expected to be Gate 1, which is closest to the port and would feature an \"active event plaza\".\n\nMore than 8,800 people are expected to enter through there for sold-out AFL games \u2014 which is roughly a third of the total attendees.\n\nThe building would feature four main gates, each funnelling thousands into the stadium on game days. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nTravelling clockwise around the stadium, Gate 2 sits right by the major intersection and would serve members and \"premium\" ticket holders.\n\nThose walking to the stadium from the Queen's Domain are expected to use Gate 3, which would feature sunken cricket practice nets and the relocated Goods Shed \u2014 which has been re-imagined as a trendy bar.\n\nThe final entrance, Gate 4, would be positioned alongside the proposed bus plaza and cater to those travelling via public transport, with access for wheelchair users.\n\nGate 1 would be expected to handle more than 8,000 people during sold-out AFL games. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nWhen major events are taking place, security checkpoints would be established up to 30 metres out from each gate.\n\nPlanners estimate about 116 people a minute would flow through the security lanes at Gate 1.\n\nThe spectator experience\n\nVisitors would then move through an atrium that opens into a circular concourse lined with food outlets, bars and bathrooms.\n\nSome wind would be able to blow into this internal concourse through some open sections, but modelling suggests there won't be any significant comfort issues.\n\nThe internal concourse wraps around the stadium and would provide access to food stalls, toilets and the seating bowl.

(Supplied: Macquarie Point Development Corporation)\n\nOn the top level, the main function room would have views of both the playing surface and Kunanyi/Mt Wellington.\n\nIt could be set up for seated dinners, presentations and cocktail events with capacities ranging between 1,500 to 2,000 people.\n\nMovable partitions would allow multiple smaller events to run at once, while kitchen and service areas would sit nearby to cater for guests.\n\nWhat about the players?\n\nThe bowels of the stadium would be inaccessible for the majority of spectators and used primarily by athletes, officials and stadium staff.\n\nAn internal service road would wrap around the internal section, giving teams secure access to operational areas.\n\nThe lowest level of the building would be off-limits for most spectators and used primarily by stadium staff and teams. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nDesigns suggest players would have access to warm-up areas, medical rooms and recovery facilities such as ice baths. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nPlayers would arrive via this tunnel and head to dedicated locked rooms, warm-up areas, medical spaces and recovery facilities like ice baths.\n\nNearby, the designs also include a \"field club\" \u2014 a premium hospitality area with views into an indoor training zone.\n\nThe players would enter the field through the field club, meaning spectators enjoying a drink could offer encouragement \u2014 or the occasional sledge \u2014 directly to players.\n\nThe proposed \"field club\" on the stadium's lowest level is being billed as a premium hospitality venue, with views into an indoor training room. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nGetting to and from the stadium\n\nThe concept designs paint a glossy picture, but the journey to and from the stadium is expected to have a major impact on how much people enjoy their day out.\n\nThe key transport study, conducted by consultancy firm WSP, found the location does \"complicate\" the city's already busy road network.\n\nDuring peak events, modelling suggests a noticeable rise in congestion along the Tasman Bridge, the Brooker Highway and key CBD roads.\n\nThe transport study suggests congestion will occur on the Tasman and Brooker highways during major events, unless specators use a mix of transport modes. (ABC News: Paul Yeomans)\n\nIn one scenario, a four-minute trip from Rosny Park to the CBD would become a 14-minute journey on the day of a major concert.\n\nThe study also found that in some cases, events at the stadium could result in overcrowding on public transport and uncomfortably large crowds of pedestrians.\n\nTo avoid gridlock, the consultants said there needed to be a \"coordinated, multi-agency\" campaign to get people out of their cars.\n\nIn its study, WSP found that for traffic to flow smoothly on the day of a sold-out Tasmania Devils game in the AFL, specific targets needed to be met in terms of the transport mix:\n\n7,500 people catching buses \u2014 31 per cent of attendees\n\n7,300 people driving and parking nearby \u2014 30 per cent\n\n5,400 people walking \u2014 22 per cent\n\n2,450 people using ride share or taxis \u2014 10 per cent\n\n735 people cycling \u2014 3 per cent\n\n490 people on the ferry \u2014 2 per cent\n\n490 people on private coaches \u2014 2 per cent\n\nTo avoid gridlock during a sold-out AFL game, the transport study suggests about 7,500 people will need to catch buses to the game. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nAs well as hitting that mix, the consultants said more buses would need to be added to Hobart's network and pedestrian infrastructure would need to be improved \u2014 including a pedestrian bridge over Collins Street.\n\nSo whether that journey feels smooth and efficient or slow and frustrating may depend largely on how well those targets are met.\n\nSo what happens now?\n\nIt is worth noting that the design of the stadium is only 70 per cent complete, with the final stages set to be designed by the contractor if the stadium goes ahead.\n\nThat decision will be made by Tasmania's upper house, which will debate the order to approve it on Thursday, December 4.\n\nThe vote to approve or reject the proposed Hobart AFL stadium is expected to take place in Tasmania's upper house on December 4. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nThe same order passed easily through the lower house in early November, but this time the vote is expected to be far tighter.\n\nWhatever the outcome, it will mark the end of years of argument, speculation and sharply drawn opinions.\n\nIf the project is approved, perhaps the next round of debates will instead be about finding a seat or a way home.",

    "text": "It has seen thousands take to the streets in opposition or support, MPs defect from the Liberal government, and a premier put it all on the line.\n\nHobart's proposed waterfront stadium has dominated the political landscape for years, and now it is about to come to a head with Legislative Councillors days away from the crucial vote.\n\nBut little about the events of the past four years has surprised former premier Peter Gutwein, who always expected a new stadium was going to be \"a challenging fight\".\n\n\"Every stadium that's been built in the world has had bitter fights,\" Mr Gutwein told the ABC.\n\n\"The arguments that went on for a decade in Perth, the challenges with the Adelaide Oval.\n\n\"It was always going to be an easy target for people because it's very easy for those who oppose the stadium to point to the cost of it as opposed to other uses for that money.\"\n\nThe fate of the proposed Macquarie Point stadium will finally be decided on December 4. (Supplied: MPC)\n\nThe 23,000-seat stadium at Macquarie Point may be firmly associated with Premier Jeremy Rockliff, but it was Mr Gutwein who kicked it all off.\n\nHe was in the midst of negotiating with the AFL to secure the 19th licence \u2014 arguably the most serious push in a decades-long crusade for Tasmania to have its own AFL team.\n\nBut the 18 club presidents still had reservations.\n\n\"They were all well aware of what happened with the Gold Coast when it first came in 20 years ago,\" Mr Gutwein said.\n\n\"That attraction and retention of players and personnel was very difficult, and they had a revolving door simply because they didn't have the necessary infrastructure.\n\n\"That came at a cost to the entire league and to the clubs as a result.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nOn top of that, two reports had already recommended that Tasmania consider building a new stadium.\n\nIt was with this in mind that Mr Gutwein decided to announce plans to build a 27,000-seat stadium at Regatta Point.\n\nMr Gutwein resigned before the deal was finalised, and back then, the team was not contingent on a stadium.\n\n\"As negotiations progressed, it didn't surprise me that the two were linked together, but it certainly wasn't something that I had contemplated at the time,\" he said.\n\nA 2019 Tasmanian AFL taskforce report outlined the state's need for a new inner-city stadium. (ABC News: Matthew Growcott)\n\nThe former premier has mostly stayed out of the limelight since he left politics.\n\nHe has watched on as his good friend and successor, Mr Rockliff, has waged his way through stadium drama, but Mr Gutwein has not weighed in \u2014 until now.\n\n\"At times, the AFL have sold this very poorly,\" Mr Gutwein said.\n\n\"I think that they did need to stand up early in the piece and make the point that when looking at what had happened in recent history with clubs like the Gold Coast, a lack of appropriate infrastructure was detrimental to the club and to its growth and to its success.\n\n\"And that, importantly, the reason that the stadium was linked to the deal now was to ensure that Tasmania had the best opportunity for success from day one. That's never been clearly articulated.\"\n\nAsked if the Tasmanian government had also sold the project poorly, Mr Gutwein simply said Mr Rockliff had had a \"difficult road\" and not a lot of clear air.\n\nJeremy Rockliff has become the driving force behind the proposed Macquarie Point stadium. (ABC News: Jessica Moran)\n\nStadium proposal led to Liberal defections\n\nWhile Mr Gutwein said he always knew the stadium issue would be \"brutal\", there was one thing that surprised him \u2014 that it was turned into a Project of State Significance.\n\nThat was because of two former Liberal MPs: John Tucker and Lara Alexander.\n\nWhen Mr Rockliff assumed the premiership in April 2022, negotiations were still underway, and the Liberals were in the majority.\n\nThe AFL at this point had become very keen on the idea of a stadium. It just wanted it in a different location \u2014 at Macquarie Point.\n\nLara Alexander says there was a significant lack of detail surrounding the Macquarie Point proposal when it was initially brought forward. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nFor Ms Alexander, it was the change of location and lack of detail around the eventual AFL agreement that started to raise concerns.\n\n\"You think, 'OK, well it's a capital development project, information will be made available,'\" she said.\n\n\"So, I was seeking information, and there was no information.\n\n\"I didn't receive anything, and when I asked for it, it was basically just the one page of talking points.\"\n\nIn May 2023, Ms Alexander and Mr Tucker announced they would be quitting the Liberal Party and moving to the crossbench due to concerns about a lack of transparency around the stadium deal and Marinus Link.\n\n\"We tried to be honest, we tried to get information because this is a move that you cannot do lightly,\" Ms Alexander said.\n\n\"I mean, we were both very aware of the consequences.\"\n\nJohn Tucker, along with Ms Alexander, ultimately resigned from the Liberal party over the stadium debacle. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nIn return for confidence and supply, the premier agreed to make the AFL deal public and put the stadium through the Project of State Significance process.\n\nAll the while debate around the stadium continued to intensify.\n\n\"Because of the AFL as an organisation's unwillingness to compromise, we were put in this sort of take it or leave it situation,\" political analyst Richard Eccleston said.\n\n\"I think that makes the politics more divisive and really difficult for both sides.\n\n\"It is a bit of a distraction in terms of the other issues that we perhaps should be discussing and grappling with.\"\n\nRichard Eccleston says the AFL's unwillingness to compromise over the stadium has made the issue more divisive. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)\n\nEconomist questions 'intangible' benefits\n\nIn September this year, after years of debates and protests, the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) handed down its assessment of the stadium. It recommended the project not proceed.\n\nThat did not deter Mr Rockliff, who said he wanted to prove to the rest of the country that \"projects such as this can go ahead\".\n\n\"What the report has massively underestimated, though, is the economic and social value of such a precinct redevelopment,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe TPC recommended the stadium be rejected, due to its size and poor economic case. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nEconomist John Madden is sceptical about that argument.\n\n\"Did they underestimate those intangible benefits? It's possible, but gee, they would've had to underestimate by a long way to turn the story around on the stadium,\" he said.\n\n\" I couldn't envisage intangible benefits big enough to make the stadium benefits greater than its costs or anywhere near its costs. \"\n\nMeanwhile, the estimated cost of the stadium has blown out from $715 million to $1.13 billion.\n\nThe government maintains it will put in no more than $375 million in capital; however, the Macquarie Point Development Corporation will take on almost $500 million in borrowings.\n\n\"Government debt is government debt, and that's a cost that Tasmanians will have to wear in the future,\" Mr Madden said.\n\n\"They've got a lot of debt to consider. This will just add a bit more to it.\"\n\nThe $1.13 billion stadium is slated to be built on Macquarie Point in Hobart. (Supplied: Macquarie Point Development Corporation)\n\nThe TPC report estimated the stadium will add $1.8 billion in debt over the decade. The state is already predicted to hit $10 billion of net debt by 2028.\n\n\"If you go on with the project, the state debt position will be a bit worse,\" Mr Madden said.\n\n\"It's not the major story, but it's not going to help.\n\n\" Of course, Tasmania can do it. They can achieve it. But it's not what you should be doing if you can possibly avoid it. \"\n\n'It's not just today's generation that will benefit'\n\nBut for Mr Gutwein, the cost of the stadium and the plan to fund it through borrowings is justifiable.\n\n\"I've never had an issue with intergenerational assets being funded by intergenerational debt,\" he said.\n\n\"We do that with bridges, we do it with hospitals. In terms of the stadium, it's not just today's generation that will benefit.\"\n\nPeter Gutwein says young people would continue to flood out of Tasmania if the stadium is rejected. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nWatching from the bench for the past few years has been \"excruciating at times\" for Mr Gutwein, who is now the president of the Northern Tasmanian Football Association.\n\nBut that stress does not compare to how he will feel during the upcoming vote in the Legislative Council, which will seal the stadium's fate.\n\n\"[If it fails] it'll be the biggest lost opportunity that Tasmania has ever had,\" he said.\n\n\"We're on the cusp of changing the state, I think, for the better.\n\n\"If the vote is no, I think that will crush confidence.\n\n\"We will see significant challenges in Tasmania moving forward, and I think that we'll continue to see an exodus of young people looking for opportunities elsewhere out of the state.\"\n\nLara Alexander says she is a little \"sad\" about how the stadium debate has unfolded across Tasmania. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nMs Alexander is a little \"sad\" when she reflects on how the stadium saga has unfolded.\n\n\"It's caused a lot of ruptures and frictions in Tasmanian society, in the community, and it shouldn't have been like that,\" she said.\n\n\"Projects like this should be about unifying people.\"\n\nNo longer in politics, she is well aware of the importance of Thursday's vote.\n\n\"Whatever decision they make is going to have such huge ramifications in the future,\" she said.",

Europe\u2019s Airbus said it was ordering immediate repairs to 6000 of its widely used A320 family of jets.\n\nThe setback appears to be among the largest recalls affecting Airbus in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.

About 3000 A320-family jets were in the air when Airbus issued its bulletin to more than 350 of the plane\u2019s operators. Earlier, Airbus released a statement saying \u201ca recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\u201d.\n\nAirbus said it subsequently identified \u201ca significant number\u201d of its aircraft which may be affected.

    "text": "So let\u2019s look under the hood of Australia\u2019s year. The good Two-thirds of the Lions series: Defying all the condescending predictions, the Wallabies turned up against the British and Irish Lions. They lost the series 2-1 against the star-studded Lions, but with the Wallabies getting better with each game, it could have easily swung the other way if a contentious call at the end of the second Test in Melbourne had gone the other way. In three Tests, the cumulative score was 68-67 to the Lions. It didn\u2019t add up to victory, but it was an enthralling series, and showed Australia could beat the world\u2019s best. South Africa success: That was evident again when the Wallabies knocked off the world No.1 Springboks in Johannesburg next up. The critics, again, had mocked Australia. But after conceding 20 points in 18 minutes, the Wallabies then routed the hosts, scoring 38 unanswered points. It was a win for the ages and the true believers, and the Wallabies almost repeated the dose a week later in Cape Town. Australia, at this point, were back, baby.\n\nWill Skelton: He was only on the field for 227 minutes of the Wallabies\u2019 total of 1200 minutes in 2025, but the giant lock was still their most influential player. Skelton almost single-handedly took on the Lions in the second and third Tests, physically and mentally. That continued in South Africa. In four massive Tests with Skelton on deck the Wallabies\u2019 cumulative score was 108-103 with a 50 per cent win rate. Guns blazing in Townsville: The hairy-chested belief of the new Wallabies was never more apparent than in Townsville against Argentina when they turned down a draw to go for a win after the siren. And got it. Harry Wilson pointed to the corner with a \u201clet\u2019s f---ing go\u201d, and the Australian public agreed. Max aura: Of many good candidates for Australia\u2019s best in 2025 \u2013 Fraser McReight, Wilson, Skelton, Tom Hooper and Len Ikitau \u2013 the star who shone brightest was 21-year-old Max Jorgensen. Time and again, the young flyer delivered on the big stage with solo tries he had no place scoring. A special talent. The bad\n\nOne-third of the Lions series: Forget being happy with a competitive effort, the Wallabies could have (should have?) won the Lions series. But they were physically insipid (not picking Skelton was an all-time bad call) for the first 50 minutes in Brisbane, and the killer blow was the second half hour in Melbourne, when the Wallabies gave up most of their 23-5 lead. The decision on Jac Morgan\u2019s cleanout was a howler, but it wasn\u2019t why Australia lost the game, and thus the series. Will Skelton\u2019s physicality was vital against the British and Irish Lions. Credit: Getty Images\n\nBotched Bledisloe: The Wallabies had a genuine chance to beat New Zealand in Auckland and end the 39-year Eden Park curse. But they botched it by falling behind early, as they\u2019d done all year: 19 points down against the Lions, 22 against the Boks and 21 against Argentina. Wallabies fightbacks \u2013 and some wins \u2013 showed character and resilience but, unsurprisingly, giving up big leads is not a path to sustained success. And so it proved in another losing Bledisloe Cup series. Passive defence: Most teams are aggressive with their line speed in defence, but the Wallabies persist with a passive, connected strategy \u2013 essentially conceding the gain line but not offering gaps in most parts of the field. It routinely allows rivals to make worryingly easy ground and set up camp in Australia\u2019s half. The Wallabies conceded an average of 27.4 points during the year, and most of the world\u2019s top five sides average fewer than 20. There is time for a rethink. The ugly\n\nWinless European tour: Enough said. Four losses in Europe, two record scores conceded and a get-out-of-jail result against Japan. The calm confidence, resilience and hard-won self-belief washed away in real time. Australia come to terms with the shock loss to Italy in Udine. Credit: Getty Images Prioritising tomorrow over today: The loss to Italy was a prime example of the self-destructive thinking in Australian rugby for many years: using Tests as opportunities to provide \u201cexperience\u201d. Australian rugby needs better depth, for sure. But rightly or wrongly, it cannot survive, let alone thrive, without Test wins. Picking anything other than the strongest team each week has led to a string of humbling and confidence-sapping losses. Forget prepping for the future and focus on building belief in the present. Australia\u2019s James O\u2019Connor takes on the All Blacks\u2019 defence. Credit: AP Ten lotto and JOC handling: Schmidt is a first-rate coach, but his handling of the No.10 position \u2013 and particularly James O\u2019Connor \u2013 this year has been perplexing. The No.10 jersey changed hands often, and while some of that was injury-related, the cohesion and game management clearly suffered. Schmidt\u2019s recalling of O\u2019Connor to the starting side after a trip to England (for a game against New Zealand) and a holiday (to play Ireland) also seemed unnecessarily messy. So too letting him leave the squad before the France game. Meanwhile, we are all a year older and still have no idea who is Australia\u2019s preferred No.10.",

Loading On the surface, training started six months beforehand, with daily acting and voice lessons between The Voice (US) commitments. (Although Grande, who was a coach on the show in 2021, has a four-octave vocal range that extends to a whistle register, she needed to master an operatic style for Glinda, particularly for No One Mourns the Wicked.) Chu may have been worried Grande\u2019s fans wouldn\u2019t be able to see Glinda past the pop superstar - but some would argue they can\u2019t see Grande without glimpsing Glinda. The Wizard of Oz has been Grande\u2019s favourite film since she was four. In 2003, Grande played Dorothy Gale in a community theatre show in Florida, and met Kristin Chenoweth backstage after watching the original Wicked Broadway production. Grande with her late grandmother, Marjorie Grande, and Kristin Chenoweth, who originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. Here, they are pictured backstage at Wicked in 2003. Credit: Instagram/Kristin Chenoweth When her grandfather died 11 years later, Grande sang Somewhere Over The Rainbow at his funeral. She sang it again in 2017 to close the One Love Manchester benefit concert, held two weeks after 22 people died in a bombing at her concert. And again to open the 2025 Oscars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUniversal Pictures first announced a Wicked film adaptation was in the works in 2012. Grande \u2013 who, a year prior, tweeted Glinda was her \u201c#DreamRole\u201d \u2013 spent the nine years it was stuck in development hell \u201chunting\u201d power producer Marc Platt for the chance to audition. Loading \u201cI have never wanted something as badly as I did this,\u201d Grande told Zach Sang in February 2024. \u201cI had no expectations, I was just thankful to go in at all, I was so excited to have the opportunity to audition.\u201d It was the \u201cbest day of [her] life\u201d when she found out she would be playing Glinda, and she bleached her hair (and eyebrows) for the role \u2013 a huge commitment after Grande\u2019s catastrophic hair damage from four years of bleaching and dyeing it red for Nickelodeon\u2019s Victorious. For three years, Grande was visibly Glinda-fied. But it was only in November that she revealed the extent of her internal metamorphosis, helped by using the Stella Adler technique to scrupulously devise the character\u2019s childhood, inner life and traumas. Elphaba Thropp (portrayed by Cynthia Erivo in the films) was also a dream role for Grande, who is pictured here in glitter-green lipstick performing The Wizard and I for a 2018 televised Wicked Halloween special.

(If you look closely, you can see an actual ruby red slipper, like Dorothy Gale\u2019s, on the back of her shiny Schiaparelli Haute Couture gown). Credit: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUniversal Pictures\u2019 Wicked: For Good Oscars campaign has been going for almost two years, kicking off with Erivo and Grande\u2019s appearance at the 2024 ceremony. They dressed in green and pink, and presented the Best Original Song and Best Original Score awards. Credit: Chris Pizzello \u201cI just wanted to design this person inside and out, even if none of it was necessary for a scene, so that I could reference it for myself and leave my own stuff at home,\u201d Grande told the New York Times. \u201cSo every time something had to trigger Glinda, it was a Glinda trigger that I used, not an Ariana one.\u201d Early on, according to the publication, she told Chu: \u201cI feel closer to Galinda [Glinda\u2019s original name] than maybe even Ariana Grande. I understand that struggle between trying to give people light and trying to understand where my light comes from myself.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t enough to earn her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, BAFTA, Golden Globe, Actor Award (formerly Screen Actors Guild), nor a Critics Choice Award, all of which she was nominated for, last awards season. It\u2019s not as if the critics \u2013 who lauded Grande\u2019s comedic timing and emotional depth in Part One and For Good \u2013 don\u2019t like movie-musicals. Actresses who have won Oscars for supporting roles in movie-musicals Rita Moreno, West Side Story (1961) Catherine Zeta-Jones, Chicago (2002) Jennifer Hudson, Dreamgirls (2006) Anne Hathaway, Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012) Ariana DeBose, West Side Story (2021) Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Emilia P\u00e9rez (2024) Grande lost all of those gongs to Zoe Salda\u00f1a\u2019s performance in cursed crime musical Emilia P\u00e9rez. Other recent Oscar winners in the category include Ariana DeBose for West Side Story, and Anne Hathaway for Les Mis\u00e9rables (another notable physical transformation).\n\nAdvertisement",

But these are a really great insects because they consume food waste as their job and they're a non vector, non pest species. So they're very easy to farm without risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the GOTERRA factory in Sydney\u2019s west, insects are growing fat on left over food. And while farming fly larvae isn\u2019t for everyone \u2013 Ms Yarger says she\u2019s found her niche!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it comes to maggots in a box, managing food waste and delivering a protein in the world, we\u2019re number one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win for GOTERRA, the insects pump out fertiliser for farms.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs chief sustainability officer Justin Frank explains, at the end of their life cycle the larvae are sold as chicken feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The chickens love it. They're designed to eat larvae and bugs, so they love it. It's really good for their gut health, but it's also full of amino acids that helps them produce eggs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there\u2019s no shortage of food waste to process, with more than 7.6 million tonnes dumped every year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Lisa Bai is a research fellow at the University of Queensland's School of Chemical Engineering \u2013 and a food waste expert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(It's) costing the Australian economy around 36 billion every year. to each household it's probably causing us to waste about $2,500 every year. That's really a shocking number!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nState governments are taking action around household waste. In several states, including NSW, businesses will soon be asked to step up, too!\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandra Geddes is executive Director Programs and Innovation at the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority or EPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Next year there are new rules coming in for food recycling and for reducing the amount of food waste that ends up in our landfills. From the 1st of July, 2026, large food generating businesses such as hospitality venues, educational institutions, correctional centres, and supermarkets will need to separate their food waste from their general waste. By 2030 all households across New South Wales will need to separate their waste.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the new rules? Well, Ms Geddes says we\u2019re simply running out of room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a landfill crisis. We will be running out of landfill capacity by 2030. We know that between a quarter and a third of the waste generated is food waste. We need to keep this out of landfills.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates say halving food waste by 2030 could deliver a $58 billion net benefit to the economy \u2013 but there are challenges, too as Dr Bai explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The biggest growing problem for food waste treatment and management is contamination. Contamination levels are rising. We're not just finding metals and glass in the waste, we're also seeing in PFAS and microplastics accumulating in this waste. And this is introducing a real risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is why we all need to clean up our act, according to the EPA\u2019s Ms Geddes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rules are incredibly clear. It's only food waste and food scraps that goes into source separation for food, no plastics, no metals, nothing else. And we know that our communities are adopting this at the household level. And we know that this is what businesses are going to do when mandates come in from next year because it's so important to keep a clean stream of organic material to be used in items like compost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting plastic from food is a slow process, but Ms Geddes says every repurposed kilogram helps the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When food waste degrades in a landfill, it releases methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas 24 times stronger than carbon dioxide. So there are real benefits to reducing emissions by separating our food and allowing it to be turned into compost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSheep farmer turned entrepreneur Olympia Yarger says extracting value from food waste is also good business.\n\n\n\n",

Nearly 100 suburbs in the state doubled in price over the same period.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Australia, suburbs with the highest growth were concentrated in once-affordable areas.\n\n\n\nBowman said that relative affordability was a key driver of increased migration to suburbs from the \"bottom end\" of town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Particularly in Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia, the areas with the biggest growth are those where prices are well below the state's typical median prices,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBowman pointed to Colebee in Blacktown North, 33 kilometres from Sydney's city centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Property values there have increased more than 180 per cent over five years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor property owners in these suburbs, the report signals a boon for their assets. But for renters and aspiring home buyers, it's a different story.\n\n\n\nHousing affordability crisis\n\nA recent report from global property information and analytics company Cotality (formerly CoreLogic), found housing affordability was getting worse \"across the board\" .\n\n\n\n\n\nEliza Owen, head of research at Cotality, said, \"For first home buyers, the metrics are pretty disappointing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's this real disparity between where incomes are and where property prices are that shows a kind of structural shift in who can access the market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain's figures also reveal an affordability issue: the median house price in Davoren Park is now $555,000, while the median weekly household income at the latest census was just $1,161.\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar affordability gap is playing out in suburbs across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been this extraordinary separation between property prices and income,\" Owen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It definitely speaks to a widening in the divide of the haves and have nots when it comes to the property market.\"\n\n\n\nBowman said while the value increases in some suburbs were \"promising\", renters or people looking to move would unfortunately be facing much higher prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are winners and losers,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe noted that Melbourne was shaping up to be an option for those seeking affordability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are early signs of people coming to Melbourne,\" Bowman said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"During the pandemic, we had a lot of people leaving Melbourne, but we have started to see this trend reverse as the city has become a lot cheaper, comparatively.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's driving skyrocketing house prices?\n\nBowman pointed to an increased interest in \"lifestyle migration\" , which began during the widespread adoption of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople had begun to desire affordable houses in coastal or regional areas, rather than being tied to pricey city lifestyles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The shift towards remote working really benefited regional pockets,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More than eighty of the suburbs with the largest growth were in regional areas, rather than inner rings of capital cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The other thing we're seeing is the tight rental markets. A surge in population in these areas resulted in record-low vacancy rates across Australia. Low vacancy rates are pushing up these property prices.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Younger Australians the new seachangers moving out of the big cities\n\nBowman anticipated property prices would only rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Broadly we are expecting some price growth, house prices will increase 6 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderpinning this projected growth are the low interest rates seen this year, coupled with the expanded First Home Buyer scheme, which Bowen said would result in more buyers getting their foot in the door.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe expected property prices to experience an uplift, especially in typically \"cheaper pockets\" as a result of the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All in all, we've seen remarkable growth due to lifestyle migration, remote work, affordability shift and increased competition,\" Bowen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Looking ahead, given the impact of the guarantee scheme, I think it will continue to improve.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

Later, after watching an anime series set in a Japanese high school, she went on a university exchange to see the country herself.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the 28-year-old lives and works in Fukuoka, in southern Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I like to consider myself as an 'ex' otaku now,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE As Hello Kitty turns 50, meet the Aussie superfan who spent a house deposit on her collection\n\nOtaku is a Japanese term for people who are obsessed with a particular subject \u2014 typically computers, video games, anime and Japanese comics (manga).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After moving and working here full-time, it's definitely less rosy; however, I still frequently find myself admiring the culture and country itself, the more I learn about it and live here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan is one of Australia's key strategic partners and the third most popular overseas travel destination among Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's developed a multi-billion-dollar content industry, capitalising on the global appeal of homegrown anime, manga and video game products, which have become central to the nation's economic and soft power.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, one year after overseas earnings from anime production exceeded its domestic revenues for the second time in history, the Japanese government launched its New Cool Japan Strategy, aiming to boost international content-related businesses to $198 billion by 2033.\n\n\n\nAustralian fans regularly flock to attend conventions like Oz Comic Con, many of which feature anime and manga. Source: AAP / SOPA Images / Sipa USA / Michael Currie With Australia launching a review of its National Cultural Policy next year, there have been calls for the government to follow allies such as Japan and South Korea to boost the export of Australian-made content.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile experts say it may not be possible to directly replicate the success of allies in this space, there are some lessons that Australia could consider.\n\n\n\nAustralia records 'worst' trade deficit in content\n\nDespite a handful of Australian creative exports that have achieved global success over the years \u2014 such as kids series Bluey, pop star Kylie Minogue, or actress Margot Robbie \u2014 Australia has had \"one of the worst creative goods trade deficits in the world\", according to Kate Fielding, the CEO of arts and culture think tank A New Approach (ANA).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a submission to the federal government's 2022 cultural policy review, ANA presented analysis that showed that for every $1 Australia exports in creative goods, $8 is imported from other countries.\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Arts Minister Tony Burke launched Creative Australia as part of Labor's National Cultural Policy, Revive. Source: AAP / Jane Dempster Fielding says the National Cultural Policy launched in response in 2023 still had \"limited focus on international [exports] within that\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are many examples of Australian success in cultural and creative industries, and we should celebrate those, but we should also go as we do with other areas of global export,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that probably Australia has had a long journey to really developing and appreciating our own cultural and creative industries, and ... part of the lag for us as a nation has been maturing and understanding that we have excellent cultural and creative contributions to make to the world.\n\n\n\nI think it is time for us to really step forward as a mature nation and take those steps.\n\nBut producing creative work overseas can be financially prohibitive for artists.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the National Cultural Policy, the government has invested $69.5 million to establish Music Australia and $19.3 million for Writers Australia \u2014 both organisations provide direct support for creators to grow international audiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Communications and the Arts says artists can also access funding to explore international collaboration and development via Creative Australia and Screen Australia.\n\n\n\nDespite these funding avenues, Fielding says Australia's support for arts and culture has been fragmented, and there's a lack of clarity about how Australia's cultural exports are tracking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think probably the first step there would be for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to do \u2026 a piece of scoping work to see what activities are currently happening, where, within different levels of government and across different agencies,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That doesn't need to be a comprehensive mapping.\"\n\n\n\nAustralia's soft power problem\n\nIn a speech on Australia's foreign policy earlier this month, Foreign Minister Penny Wong described Australia as the \"architect\" of the Asia-Pacific region, citing achievements in securing several geopolitical and diplomatic deals within the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to the Lowy Institute's 2025 Southeast Asia Index, while Australia ranks second in terms of its influence on defence networks in the region, it ranks ninth in terms of cultural and economic influence.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's creative and cultural exports were identified in a 2017 foreign policy white paper as potential avenues for the nation to exert soft power \u2014 which is the ability to attract and influence other countries through non-military measures \u2014 along with international education, tourism and migration.\n\n\n\nFollowing the paper's release, the then-Coalition government vowed to develop new approaches to soft power and launched the first-ever Soft Power Review in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the review was discontinued in October 2020, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade citing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Conley Tyler, an honorary fellow at the Asia Institute at the University of Melbourne, says it's time to revisit the 2017 paper, and for Australia to consider other tools of diplomatic influence beyond its security and defence assets, including arts and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can do so much in the cultural and creative realm for really very little money compared to the amount of money that, say, defence equipment costs,\" says Conley Tyler.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told SBS News the department \"works closely with Australia's world-class cultural sector to showcase our creativity, values and diversity internationally\".\n\n\n\nDespite its global fame, Australia has little involvement with Bluey's international distribution and its success, as it's operated by BBC Studios. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi \"Our cultural exports \u2014 from film and television to literature, music, design and art \u2014 are among the best in the world. They tell the story of who we are and play an important role in strengthening Australia's voice and relationships,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nWhat can Australia learn from its Asian allies?\n\nFrom Japanese manga One Piece to the viral Korean TV series Squid Game, the cultural products of Japan and South Korea have been loved by Australians. While the two countries adopt different strategies to boost their cultural exports, they both enjoy similar levels of government support.\n\n\n\n\n\nTets Kimura, an adjunct lecturer in creative arts at Flinders University, says the Japanese government initially had very little to do with the surge of interest in anime, which began attracting international fame in the 1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[The rise of anime] happened organically, picked up by the Japanese consumers first, then picked up by the foreign consumers,\" he tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nThe whole movement happened outside of government control.\n\nAs demand for anime grew, so did its profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the anime industry contributed a record JPY3.84 trillion ($37.8 billion) to Japan's economy, according to the Association of Japanese Animations. Of that, JPY$2.17 trillion ($21.4 billion) was generated from overseas anime content.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the anime boom has also come hand in hand with a surge in piracy, which reportedly costs the country billions each year. A 2023 study commissioned by a Tokyo-based anti-piracy group and conducted by accounting firm PwC estimated losses totalling JPY$1.95 trillion ($19.2 billion).\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Kimura, the growing revenue from international consumers, coupled with the huge economic losses from piracy, has pushed the Japanese government to consider a new economic strategy to maximise profits from the industry.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australians are getting hooked on Korean TV\n\nIn 2019, after a decade of various government initiatives, Japan formally launched the first iteration of the Cool Japan strategy, which promotes Japan through multilateral collaboration between the government and private sector in culture, tourism, trade, education and other intellectual property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With major changes taking place in the environment surrounding [Cool Japan], the soft power of [Cool Japan] is an extremely potent means of ensuring Japan can maintain its presence and influence on the global stage,\" the 2019 Cool Japan Strategy paper reads.\n\n\n\n'A tool of global influence'\n\nIn contrast with Japan, the South Korean government took a more proactive approach to promoting its cultural content in the 1990s, when Korean pop music (K-pop) and South Korean cinema began to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sung-Ae Lee from Macquarie University recalls a well-cited anecdote during Kim Young-sam's presidency between 1993 and 1998: a government adviser pointed out that the global box-office revenue of Hollywood blockbuster Jurassic Park was roughly equivalent to the foreign sales of 1.5 million Hyundai cars.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, successive South Korean governments \u2014 whether conservative or progressive \u2014 have launched initiatives to support the creative sector's development.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The hit Korean show that's infiltrated schools and stereos around Australia\n\nThis includes mandating that state and local governments fund cultural sector initiatives, offering tax incentives and establishing the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA), which oversees global marketing, talent development and cultural export, explains Lee.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsecutive governments have also sought to reframe political language around the impacts of South Korea's cultural exports, shifting it from the realm of economic policy to \"a tool of global influence\".\n\n\n\n\n\nLee says Australia can learn from South Korea's \"coordinated, export-driven cultural strategy\", adding that while South Korea has a one-stop agency to manage funding for cultural projects (KOCCA), Australia's support remains fragmented across several organisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia could adopt a similar whole-of-government framework linking creative funding with trade, diplomacy and education, turning its artistic strengths into a cohesive and globally recognisable cultural brand,\" she says.\n\n\n\nTo amplify soft power, treat artists well first\n\nBut simply having a strong cultural sector doesn't necessarily elevate soft power, says Roald Maliangkay, a professor of culture, history and language at the Australian National University's College of Asia and the Pacific.\n\n\n\nDuring his Golden Globe Award speech, South Korean director Bong Joon Ho (middle in the second row) famously claimed that once audiences \"overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles\", they would be introduced to a new world. Source: AAP / EPA / Kim Hee-chul He says international consumers often view a country's cultural products through the lens of their impression of the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther nations, including Saudi Arabia and China, have studied the success of South Korea's cultural sector but face challenges in attracting similar international attention, despite their unique cultural products, Maliangkay says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says that, although Australia has a rich history of First Nations culture and storytelling, and is viewed positively by the rest of the world, it can struggle selling its content to international audiences due to a lack of a defined modern Australian culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do not have a more modern culture that people would fondly associate with. [Also,] South Korea and Japan both have a very unique language,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOne of the things that people have really enjoyed when they listen to K-pop or watch Korean TV dramas is the idea that by learning a little bit, you gain some cultural capital.\n\nMaliangkay says Australia could look to define its uniqueness by embracing First Nations cultures: \"Because that's truly unique, and I think that's an important element.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the cultural strategies of both Japan and South Korea have some limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\nKimura says the Japanese government offers little support for individual anime creators.\n\n\n\nIndividual artists and creators have played key roles in the huge success of Japan's anime sector, creating cultural icons that resonate with overseas audiences. Source: AAP / ABACA / PA / Blondet Eliot \"A lot of those people ... are really, really low paid, and a lot [of them] do not see a promised future unless there's a sacrifice made by the Japanese creators,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the Japanese government launched a revised policy, the New Cool Japan Strategy, to adapt to post-COVID digitisation, and acknowledged there's an \"insufficient environment for creators to engage in activities\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn South Korea, Lee says gender imbalance in creative leadership, labour exploitation and burnout have been persistent issues affecting the cultural sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also says South Korea's heavy dependence on global streaming platforms has limited its control over revenue and cultural representation \u2014- an issue that Australia's music industry has long identified with platforms like Spotify.\n\n\n\nFor Australia to boost its cultural exports, not only should it look to proactively address some of these issues, but it has a further hurdle to overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nConley Tyler says to make cultural exports an effective tool of soft power, they need to be \"organic\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have to organically come from artists themselves, and then be sort of supported and amplified by the government,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think the Australian government should be deciding what our creative industries are doing, but I think we should understand that they are important and that they deserve to be funded and supported, and that that's in our national interest, just as much as some of the security investments that we make.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "There's nothing Australians love more than a succulent Chinese meal , as witnessed this week by the outpouring of grief following the announcement that beloved Sydney staple Chinese Noodle House will be closing in December.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was really sad, it's all over Instagram,\" Hope, a Sydney University student, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sydney won't be the same.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut news of the end of the Haymarket casual dining staple, famed for its cheap and delicious dumplings and hand-pulled noodles, has also sparked confusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt its location on the ground floor of a drab building on Thomas Street, there are no fewer than four similarly titled restaurants, and more can be found across greater Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll share near-identical menus, and at least two have plastic grapes dangling over the heads of diners.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo which restaurant is closing? Will another take its place? And what's the deal with the grapes on the ceiling anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that underneath the surface of the Chinese Noodle House saga is what appears to be a Succession-like struggle of intertwined restaurants and one ageing patriarch.\n\n\n\nWhich restaurant is closing?\n\nIf you're facing the strip mall from the street, Chinese Noodle House is the restaurant on the right, closest to Thomas Street.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo your left, you'll find Chinese Noodle Restaurant, which also has grapes on the ceiling and a similar menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese restaurants share the popular outdoor dining area in the courtyard.\n\n\n\nCurrent owner Eric Zhang spoke to SBS News outside his family's restaurant. Source: SBS News Current owner, Eric Zhang, told SBS News his family had been running Chinese Noodle House since 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our landlord sold the business to us 10 years ago,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhy is it shutting down?\n\nA post on Chinese Noodle House's Instagram page said the restaurant was closing \"due to the landlord's unilateral decision not to renew our lease\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where things get tricky, because the tenant for the past 10 years has been Zhang's mother-in-law, a former employee of the eatery across the way, Chinese Noodle Restaurant.\n\n\n\nBoth Chinese Noodle Restaurant and Chinese Noodle House were founded by now-retired patriarch Xiao Tang Qin, better known to patrons as the violinist of Thomas Street.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver three decades as a restaurateur in Sydney, Qin started 12 Chinese Noodle outlets, according to the ABC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current landlord at Chinese Noodle House is reportedly Qin's nephew, Xin Jiang Sun.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang's mother-in-law, the former Chinese Noodle Restaurant employee, bought the lease from Sun to operate Chinese Noodle House.\n\n\n\nWhat's with the grapes?\n\nThe connection between the restaurants explains the similarities. But it doesn't explain how the iconic plastic grapes got there in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 2017, SBS investigated why dumplings might taste better when there are plastic grapes on the ceiling.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The curious case of grapes on the restaurant roof\n\nThe answer lies in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where real grapes dangle from the trellises above many eateries in the north-western province.\n\n\n\n\n\nXiaotang Qin, the original owner of Chinese Noodle Restaurant and famous for his violin, migrated from Xinjiang to Australia in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS reported that many north-western Chinese eateries added the plastic grapes as a tribute to home.\n\n\n\nWhen will it close?\n\nThe current Chinese Noodle House will shut in mid-December.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang did not comment on the rumour that the landlord was considering opening their own restaurant in the same spot, one that would presumably share a similar name, menu, and decorations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the current owners, Zhang told SBS News they hope to open a new shop in a different location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been here for 10 years and I haven't had much time with my family or my kids. So we've decided to take a break for now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there's a new shop, we'll let everyone know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Chinese.\n\n\n\n",

Virgin Australia operates only four A320s, all of them in its regional Western Australia business. The Brisbane-based airline expects to cover any disruptions with its existing capacity in its Boeing 737 fleet.\n\n\u201cWe do not anticipate any impact to either Virgin Australia or our Regional Airline operations,\u201d a spokesperson said. A Qantas source said while it had some A320s in WA, the issue was not affecting its aircraft. A sobering sight for travellers. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong Air New Zealand says it has cancelled 12 flights in response to the Airbus order. Chief Safety and Risk Officer Nathan McGraw said aircraft affected by the software recall were issued a fresh directive on Saturday, allowing affected aircraft to continue operating until 10.59am AEDT.\n\n\u201cThis means that, where possible, we can operate A320 services today before commencing the required updates,\u201d he said. \u201cAir New Zealand will begin rolling through the updates to its A320 fleet as quickly as possible to minimise ongoing disruptions.\u201d There are 2274 Airbus A320s in service in the Asia-Pacific region, more than any other single region globally, according to Cirium aviation analytics company. Europe\u2019s Airbus said it was ordering immediate repairs to 6000 of its widely used A320 family of jets.\n\nThe setback appears to be among the largest recalls affecting Airbus in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model. There are about 11,300 A320-family jets in operation, including 6440 of the core A320 model, which first flew in 1987. About 3000 A320-family jets were in the air when Airbus issued its bulletin to more than 350 of the plane\u2019s operators. Earlier, Airbus released a statement saying \u201ca recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\u201d.\n\nAirbus said it subsequently identified \u201ca significant number\u201d of its aircraft which may be affected. Reports say the incident in question involved a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, during which several passengers were injured after a sharp loss of altitude.

Cebu Pacific, which flies from Sydney and Melbourne to the Philippines, also took to X to confirm it is affected.\n\nLoading It urged passengers travelling within the next two days to check their flight\u2019s status on the website \u201cbefore heading to the airport\u201d. Overseas, the world\u2019s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said some 340 aircraft \u2013 70 per cent of its A320 fleet \u2013 would need the fix. In Colombia, the recall is also affecting 70 per cent of the airline Avianca\u2019s fleet. The airline has closed ticket sales until December 8. Other airlines said they would take planes briefly out of service to do the repairs, including Germany\u2019s Lufthansa, India\u2019s IndiGo, and UK-based easyJet.",

    "text": "So let\u2019s look under the hood of Australia\u2019s year. The good Two-thirds of the Lions series: Defying all the condescending predictions, the Wallabies turned up against the British and Irish Lions. They lost the series 2-1 against the star-studded Lions, but with the Wallabies getting better with each game, it could have easily swung the other way if a contentious call at the end of the second Test in Melbourne had gone the other way. In three Tests, the cumulative score was 68-67 to the Lions. It didn\u2019t add up to victory, but it was an enthralling series, and showed Australia could beat the world\u2019s best. South Africa success: That was evident again when the Wallabies knocked off the world No.1 Springboks in Johannesburg next up. The critics, again, had mocked Australia. But after conceding 20 points in 18 minutes, the Wallabies then routed the hosts, scoring 38 unanswered points. It was a win for the ages and the true believers, and the Wallabies almost repeated the dose a week later in Cape Town. Australia, at this point, were back, baby.\n\nWill Skelton: He was only on the field for 227 minutes of the Wallabies\u2019 total of 1200 minutes in 2025, but the giant lock was still their most influential player. Skelton almost single-handedly took on the Lions in the second and third Tests, physically and mentally. That continued in South Africa. In four massive Tests with Skelton on deck the Wallabies\u2019 cumulative score was 108-103 with a 50 per cent win rate. Guns blazing in Townsville: The hairy-chested belief of the new Wallabies was never more apparent than in Townsville against Argentina when they turned down a draw to go for a win after the siren. And got it. Harry Wilson pointed to the corner with a \u201clet\u2019s f---ing go\u201d, and the Australian public agreed. Max aura: Of many good candidates for Australia\u2019s best in 2025 \u2013 Fraser McReight, Wilson, Skelton, Tom Hooper and Len Ikitau \u2013 the star who shone brightest was 21-year-old Max Jorgensen. Time and again, the young flyer delivered on the big stage with solo tries he had no place scoring. A special talent. The bad\n\nOne-third of the Lions series: Forget being happy with a competitive effort, the Wallabies could have (should have?) won the Lions series. But they were physically insipid (not picking Skelton was an all-time bad call) for the first 50 minutes in Brisbane, and the killer blow was the second half hour in Melbourne, when the Wallabies gave up most of their 23-5 lead. The decision on Jac Morgan\u2019s cleanout was a howler, but it wasn\u2019t why Australia lost the game, and thus the series. Will Skelton\u2019s physicality was vital against the British and Irish Lions. Credit: Getty Images\n\nBotched Bledisloe: The Wallabies had a genuine chance to beat New Zealand in Auckland and end the 39-year Eden Park curse. But they botched it by falling behind early, as they\u2019d done all year: 19 points down against the Lions, 22 against the Boks and 21 against Argentina. Wallabies fightbacks \u2013 and some wins \u2013 showed character and resilience but, unsurprisingly, giving up big leads is not a path to sustained success. And so it proved in another losing Bledisloe Cup series. Passive defence: Most teams are aggressive with their line speed in defence, but the Wallabies persist with a passive, connected strategy \u2013 essentially conceding the gain line but not offering gaps in most parts of the field. It routinely allows rivals to make worryingly easy ground and set up camp in Australia\u2019s half. The Wallabies conceded an average of 27.4 points during the year, and most of the world\u2019s top five sides average fewer than 20. There is time for a rethink. The ugly\n\nWinless European tour: Enough said. Four losses in Europe, two record scores conceded and a get-out-of-jail result against Japan. The calm confidence, resilience and hard-won self-belief washed away in real time. Australia come to terms with the shock loss to Italy in Udine. Credit: Getty Images Prioritising tomorrow over today: The loss to Italy was a prime example of the self-destructive thinking in Australian rugby for many years: using Tests as opportunities to provide \u201cexperience\u201d. Australian rugby needs better depth, for sure. But rightly or wrongly, it cannot survive, let alone thrive, without Test wins. Picking anything other than the strongest team each week has led to a string of humbling and confidence-sapping losses. Forget prepping for the future and focus on building belief in the present. Australia\u2019s James O\u2019Connor takes on the All Blacks\u2019 defence. Credit: AP Ten lotto and JOC handling: Schmidt is a first-rate coach, but his handling of the No.10 position \u2013 and particularly James O\u2019Connor \u2013 this year has been perplexing. The No.10 jersey changed hands often, and while some of that was injury-related, the cohesion and game management clearly suffered. Schmidt\u2019s recalling of O\u2019Connor to the starting side after a trip to England (for a game against New Zealand) and a holiday (to play Ireland) also seemed unnecessarily messy. So too letting him leave the squad before the France game. Meanwhile, we are all a year older and still have no idea who is Australia\u2019s preferred No.10.",

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrande\u2019s approach to her five Wicked auditions made Chu feel like he had met \u201cthe real Glinda\u201d for the first time. Loading On the surface, training started six months beforehand, with daily acting and voice lessons between The Voice (US) commitments. (Although Grande, who was a coach on the show in 2021, has a four-octave vocal range that extends to a whistle register, she needed to master an operatic style for Glinda, particularly for No One Mourns the Wicked.) Chu may have been worried Grande\u2019s fans wouldn\u2019t be able to see Glinda past the pop superstar - but some would argue they can\u2019t see Grande without glimpsing Glinda. The Wizard of Oz has been Grande\u2019s favourite film since she was four. In 2003, Grande played Dorothy Gale in a community theatre show in Florida, and met Kristin Chenoweth backstage after watching the original Wicked Broadway production. Grande with her late grandmother, Marjorie Grande, and Kristin Chenoweth, who originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. Here, they are pictured backstage at Wicked in 2003.

She sang it again in 2017 to close the One Love Manchester benefit concert, held two weeks after 22 people died in a bombing at her concert. And again to open the 2025 Oscars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUniversal Pictures first announced a Wicked film adaptation was in the works in 2012. Grande \u2013 who, a year prior, tweeted Glinda was her \u201c#DreamRole\u201d \u2013 spent the nine years it was stuck in development hell \u201chunting\u201d power producer Marc Platt for the chance to audition. Loading \u201cI have never wanted something as badly as I did this,\u201d Grande told Zach Sang in February 2024. \u201cI had no expectations, I was just thankful to go in at all, I was so excited to have the opportunity to audition.\u201d It was the \u201cbest day of [her] life\u201d when she found out she would be playing Glinda, and she bleached her hair (and eyebrows) for the role \u2013 a huge commitment after Grande\u2019s catastrophic hair damage from four years of bleaching and dyeing it red for Nickelodeon\u2019s Victorious. For three years, Grande was visibly Glinda-fied. But it was only in November that she revealed the extent of her internal metamorphosis, helped by using the Stella Adler technique to scrupulously devise the character\u2019s childhood, inner life and traumas. Elphaba Thropp (portrayed by Cynthia Erivo in the films) was also a dream role for Grande, who is pictured here in glitter-green lipstick performing The Wizard and I for a 2018 televised Wicked Halloween special.

They dressed in green and pink, and presented the Best Original Song and Best Original Score awards. Credit: Chris Pizzello \u201cI just wanted to design this person inside and out, even if none of it was necessary for a scene, so that I could reference it for myself and leave my own stuff at home,\u201d Grande told the New York Times. \u201cSo every time something had to trigger Glinda, it was a Glinda trigger that I used, not an Ariana one.\u201d Early on, according to the publication, she told Chu: \u201cI feel closer to Galinda [Glinda\u2019s original name] than maybe even Ariana Grande. I understand that struggle between trying to give people light and trying to understand where my light comes from myself.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t enough to earn her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, BAFTA, Golden Globe, Actor Award (formerly Screen Actors Guild), nor a Critics Choice Award, all of which she was nominated for, last awards season. It\u2019s not as if the critics \u2013 who lauded Grande\u2019s comedic timing and emotional depth in Part One and For Good \u2013 don\u2019t like movie-musicals. Actresses who have won Oscars for supporting roles in movie-musicals Rita Moreno, West Side Story (1961) Catherine Zeta-Jones, Chicago (2002) Jennifer Hudson, Dreamgirls (2006) Anne Hathaway, Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012) Ariana DeBose, West Side Story (2021) Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Emilia P\u00e9rez (2024) Grande lost all of those gongs to Zoe Salda\u00f1a\u2019s performance in cursed crime musical Emilia P\u00e9rez. Other recent Oscar winners in the category include Ariana DeBose for West Side Story, and Anne Hathaway for Les Mis\u00e9rables (another notable physical transformation).\n\nAdvertisement",

As a couple of whales pass by, the 43-year-old leans back in his chair, inhales and ponders about the people that graced the same spot before him.\n\n\u201cHow many hundreds of people have sat there and had their coffee with that same view?\u201d Gabo Island\u2019s newest caretaker told Yahoo News Australia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of many, many people in that line. I feel very lucky and very privileged to have this opportunity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA year-and-a-half after he scored the job, which requires him to live alone on the remote Victorian island for six months of the year, Sandy said he\u2019s still \u201cpinching himself\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a magical place,\u201d he said. Gabo Island is home to one of Australia\u2019s oldest still functioning lighthouses, as well as resident penguins and seals. At 47-metres tall, and 163 years old, its pink granite walls are filled with history.\n\nMuch to his delight, Sandy will now forever be etched into its story. And it will forever be etched in his heart.\n\nGabo Island is home to one of Australia\u2019s oldest still functioning lighthouses. Source: Sandy Duthie.\n\nExpat falls in love with 'familiar' remote Aussie island\n\nSandy first learned of Gabo Island in 2019 after he moved to Australia from Scotland.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat was supposed to be a holiday to visit his partner\u2019s family in Mallacoota \u2014 the closest town to the tourist destination \u2014 quickly came unravelled due to bushfires and Covid-19.\n\n\u201cI changed my holiday visa to a permanent residency,\u201d he told Yahoo. \u201cThe universe decided to keep me here.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Black Summer fires, the long-time arborist was quickly able to find work.\n\n\u201cMy first experience on Gabo was as a contractor. I came out to do weed control and spent two weeks out here,\u201d Sandy recalled, noting there was something about the place that seemed strangely familiar.\n\n\u201cGabo has a really unusual granite formation for Australia, but it\u2019s very similar to the granite from the northeast of Scotland where I was born and grew up. So immediately, there was a familiarity.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI was just amazed by the place and got chatting with the caretaker at the time, Leo, about how he got his job.\u201d\n\nLittle did he know that conversation would leave a lasting impression.\n\nDolphins, seals, whales and penguins can be seen in the waters off Gabo Island. Source: Sandy Duthie.\n\nHow Sandy spends his time on Gabo Island\n\nAfter 25 years in the role, Leo decided to hang up his hat last year and return to the mainland full-time, paving the way for Sandy to step in.\n\nHe and his counterpart Jeff now work month-on, month-off shifts, keeping a watchful eye on the island, recording weather observations every six hours, and hosting guests at the Assistant Light Keepers Quarters.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe pair also take turns tending to the vegetable garden and maintaining the salt-weathered structures.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always painting to do, there\u2019s always grass mowing to do. There\u2019s always something you can fix or research.\u201d\n\nWhen the weather gets too wild, bringing \u201chowling\u201d winds, he sometimes cracks open a book, or heads to the workshop to make his own cutlery.\n\nThe summers can be quite busy on Gabo Island, with people from the mainland stopping by on their boats to go for a wander.\n\nCamping is not allowed, and guests can only stay in the assigned quarters, which sleeps eight and is often booked out months in advance.\n\nIsland caretaker doesn't see another person for weeks\n\nSandy said that during some of the quieter months, he won\u2019t see another person for weeks at a time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cSometimes they\u2019ll really scare you. I\u2019ve had cases where I haven\u2019t seen another face for two or three weeks, and somebody\u2019s just appeared while I\u2019ve been busy whipper snippering a track or something. It can take you by surprise.\u201d\n\nWhile the isolation isn\u2019t for everyone, Sandy said the job has \u201cexceeded all expectations\u201d. And it's never far from his mind.\n\n\u201cDo I miss the mainland? Yes, but at the same time, when I\u2019m on the mainland, I miss Gabo.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story tip?
