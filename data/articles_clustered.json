    "text": "A\ufeffustralia Post is planning to lift stamp prices by 15 cents per letter from the middle of the year to offset losses.\n\nThe postal service announced today it was seeking approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to increase the basic postage rate from $1.70 to $1.85.\n\nThe price of concession stamps and seasonal greeting cards won't change, remaining at 60 cents and 65 cents respectively.\n\nAustralia Post is seeking to increase the cost of stamps to offset losses in its letters division. (Getty)\n\nAustralia Post says it has also offered further cost-of-living relief by increasing the number of concession stamps eligible customers can purchase, from 50 to 75 per year.\n\nFewer than 3 per cent of letters are sent by individuals, with the vast majority mailed by businesses and government agencies.\n\nThe average cost impact to Australian households of the proposed price rise to $1.85 will be less than $1 extra per year.\n\nAustralia Post's letters service has steeply declined and is now at levels recorded in the 1930s.\n\nIn the past financial year, volumes dropped a further 11.7 per cent (excluding election activities).\n\nEven with the contribution of elections, the letters service still reported a $230.4 million loss.\n\nAustralia Post group chief executive officer Paul Graham says despite the slump in demand for letters, the corporation was still delivering them to more addresses.\n\n\"As letter volumes continue to fall as customers increasingly take up digital options, Australia Post needs to ensure the Letters service remains sustainable now and into the future,\" he said.\n\n\"The proposed increase is one of the ways we are responsibly addressing our financial challenges so we can keep serving our customers and communities.\"\n\nNEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.",

    "text": "When Caitlyn Goodman was growing up as one of four girls in her family, she never dreamed she would one day be building houses as a carpenter.\n\nThe prospect of becoming a female tradie just never occurred to her, she said.\n\nBut the signs were there, even from a young age.\n\n\"My dad was a fencer, and growing up, he taught me how to use power tools. I was always very drawn to it.\" Goodman, 22, said.\n\nCaitlyn Goodman is a third-year carpentry apprentice in Victoria. (Supplied Nine)\n\nDuring her final year of high school, Goodman worked at Bunnings in the timber yard.\n\n\"I was becoming very familiar with all the types of timbers and power tools. I was learning a lot,\" she said.\n\nAfter finishing her higher school certificate, Goodman briefly toyed with the idea of becoming a nurse, having also worked as a ward clerk, before deciding to follow her heart and become a carpenter.\n\n\"One day, I just said, Screw it. I'm just going do it, why not? Why can't I do it?\" Goodman said.\n\nWith the construction industry facing a critical shortage of workers, particularly in carpentry, getting apprentice job proved to be easy, especially after her dad put a call out to builders he knew, Goodman said.\n\n\"We got in contact with Chris, who is my boss now. He had an interview with me. He was really happy, and said, 'When can you start?'\" Goodman said.\n\nGoodman is now a third-year apprentice, helping build residential homes in the Greater Melbourne area.\n\nThe Housing Industry Association (HIA) says Australia desperately needs more people like her to have any hope of meeting Australia's ambitious construction targets.\n\nChippies top list of workers in demand\n\nAt the top of the \"short supply\" list are carpenters - the very trade Goodman is mastering.\n\nAccording to the HIA, the math of the National Housing Accord simply doesn't add up without a massive influx of new boots on the ground.\n\nUnder the Accord, the Federal Government has set a target to build 1.2 million homes over five years. But according to Mike Hermon, HIA Executive Director for Future Workforce, the industry is currently missing a vital piece of the puzzle.\n\n\"Workforce shortages remain one of the biggest constraints on increasing home building activity, with the nation needing an estimated 83,000 additional skilled workers across our key trades,\" Hermon said.\n\n\"Shortages across key residential construction trades, particularly carpentry, are limiting building capacity across the states. Builders across the country are telling us the same thing - demand for housing is there, but access to skilled labour is holding projects back.\"\n\nRecent HIA data reveals a sobering reality for the sector. A survey of small business members found that 67 percent of respondents are having trouble recruiting or retaining staff.\n\n\"If we do not train more apprentices now, the homes Australia needs simply will not be built,\" Hermon said.\n\n\"Every new home starts with an apprentice on site.\"\n\nFor Goodman, the reasons behind the shortage aren't a mystery. While she loves the reward of \"building someone's dream,\" she said the financial barriers for young people were steep.\n\n\"People start their apprenticeship, and then it's just not everything they want - like the pay,\" Goodman said. \"They don't want to stick around and bend over backwards for $16 an hour. Carpenters are one of the lowest-paying trades.\"\n\nWhile the government has introduced incentives like a $10,000 apprentice grant, Goodman said the fine print often excluded those who needed it most.\n\n\"You have to be living out of home [to get the full grant], but I can't afford to move out of home,\" she said. \"Rather than giving out grants and all that, I think, honestly, just increase the pay.\"\n\nNo looking back\n\nGoodman admits that stepping on site for the first time as an apprentice was daunting.\n\n\"I was really scared, honestly, starting out,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd heard quite a few stories of apprentices not being treated the greatest on site, which is really disheartening to even hear now.\"\n\nCaitlyn Goodman, 22, was named HIA's Victorian Apprentice of the year in 2025. (Supplied)\n\nHowever, those fears were quickly dispelled.\n\nGoodman said she found herself in a small, supportive team and was even working alongside a female chippie.\n\n\"She's made me feel a lot more comfortable working in the industry,\" Goodman said. \"I don't get treated differently, and I don't get treated with disrespect.\"\n\nGoodman is a staunch advocate for the trades, especially for other women.\n\n\"Every single time I tell people what I do, they go, 'Oh, really?' or they think I'm lying,\" she said.\n\n\"I tell other girls - why not? Just do it.\n\n\"I'm going to graduate and be able to actually save up to buy a house, rather than paying off student debt.\"\n\nTradie salaries by occupation\n\n\ufeffElectrician $95,000 \u2013 $115,000\n\nPlumber $85,000 \u2013 $100,000\n\nCarpenter $80,000 \u2013 $95,000\n\nPainter $80,000 \u2013 $90,000\n\nBricklayer$75,000 \u2013 $85,000\n\n(Source: Seek.com.au)\n\nDo you have a story?

    "text": "In the lead-up to one of the most hotly anticipated events at this year's Winter Olympics, Scotty James says winning a gold medal will not \"validate\" who he is as a snowboarder.\n\nBut it is the one thing that he does not have in his medal cabinet and, at 31 years old and in his fifth Olympics, this could be his final chance.\n\nGet the latest: Winter Olympics day six: Australia wins first gold as US great pipped in halfpipe Stay across the highs and lows of the Games with the ABC Sport Daily podcast and ABC Sport.\n\nThe men's snowboard halfpipe final is arguably one of the biggest ticket items in the entire Games and the eyes of the world will be fixed on this picturesque northern Italian valley.\n\nThe rumours are that everyone is about to throw down something incredible special.\n\nValentino Guseli says this competition could be anyone's. (Getty Images: Anadolu/Mine Kasapoglu)\n\n\"I think, for the first time in quite a long time in halfpipe, it almost could be anyone's day,\" Valentino Guseli said after the epic qualifying campaign.\n\n\"But Scotty's got some stuff that's pretty insane and pretty hard to beat.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I know if I do my best stuff then I could potentially be up there, but yeah, I'll have to do some pretty good riding, I think.\n\n\"The Japanese guys have way more \u2026 I don't know.\n\n\"It's going to be crazy and it's hard to speculate on.\n\n\"But I think all you can do is watch and see what happens and enjoy the show.\"\n\nQualifying started 'like a final'. The actual final will be 'the greatest show on earth' Scotty James is the man to beat in the snowboard halfpipe at the 2026 Winter Olympics, but a stunning qualifying competition proves that the final is going to be on another level entirely.\n\nIf James has got something special planned for the final, he is not letting on just yet.\n\n\"I've learned over the years that my lips should never be looser than a wizard's sleeve when it comes to tricks in the halfpipe,\" he said earlier this week.\n\nIf qualifying proved anything it is that the field is absolutely stacked heading into the final.\n\nOne of the most remarkable series of runs ever to take place at an Olympic Games took place at the Livigno Snow Park on Wednesday night, which saw James claim the top spot heading into the final.\n\nIn Beijing it took two historic triple corks from the Japanese megastar Ayumu Hirano to take the gold ahead of James.\n\nEven then James was adamant that there was more to life in the pipe than triples and that his sublime technicality should be rewarded.\n\nScotty James knows he needs to bring his best to have a chance in the halfpipe final. (Getty Images: Ian MacNicol)\n\nIn part that's down to his height \u2014 it's far harder to complete a triple when you stand at 185 centimetres. Hirano is just 165cm tall.\n\nSo James has to think outside the box.\n\n\"My plan this year, regardless of the results, is to try and revolutionise halfpipe snowboarding in the way I would interpret it,\" he said earlier this week.\n\n\"It's obviously subjective, but I wanted to push it in the direction that made me excited to go up there and push it.\n\n\"I feel like I'm snowboarding the way I want to snowboard and, fortunately, being rewarded for that.\"\n\nSubjectivity is obviously key in this.\n\nAs with any judged sport, athletes can only do so much. It's the six judges that will ultimately determine James and Guseli's fate and those of all 12 finalists.\n\nAnd, under extraordinary pressure from both time and occasion, judges can make understandable mistakes.\n\nOne of the six judges for the halfpipe in Livigno is Slovenian Iztok \u0160umati\u0107, who was head judge at the controversial slopestyle competition in Beijing, where a missed knee-grab was credited as a board grab and helped give American Max Parott gold.\n\nThe others are Great Britain's Gaz Wessman Vogan, Sweden's Fredrik Westman, Switzerland's Andrin Regli, Julien Haricot of France and Japan's Ryo Hashimoto.\n\nThe same six judges were in the booth for the World Cup event in Laax last month, where James won gold and Guseli bronze.\n\nJudges rule on execution and amplitude. (Getty Images: David Ramos)\n\nOverseeing those six is Australian Adam Begg.\n\nBegg has been in snowboarding for more than 30 years and got into judging after a severe injury kept him off the snow in 2000.\n\nHe first judged internationally in 2006 and has is now officiating in his third Winter Olympics.\n\nSpeaking to ABC Sport earlier this week, Begg outlined the key things the judges were looking for to score a run.\n\n\"With halfpipe, we base [scoring] off five major criteria, which is progression, amplitude, execution, variety and difficulty,\" he said.\n\n\"And then it's just a mix of them, so we're looking to make sure it's a well-rounded run.\n\n\"I guess for people at home, amplitude is an easy one to quantify because it's how big they go out of the halfpipe.\n\n\"And the other one that's really easy to see, if you're not experienced with the sport, is execution \u2014 so whether they put a hand down, fall over, grab, long or short. It's those sort of things that we try and look forward to discern between the runs.\n\n\"For us, difficulty comes in spins, and progression is whether it's been done before in the halfpipe or whether that combination links well.\"\n\nSo how is James going to catch the eyes of the judges?\n\nFor a start, he is pushing his ability to ride switch \u2014 with the non-dominant foot forward \u2014 and backside, with his back facing down the pipe.\n\nScotty James will no doubt attract a massive crowd for the snowboard halfpipe final. (Getty Images: Adam Pretty)\n\nHis winning run at the recent X Games, albeit in a much reduced field as many of the sport's best chose to stay in Europe to hone their skills, featured a switch backside 1440 into a backside 1440 \u2014 four complete spins.\n\nThose tricks had never been seen before in combination in the Aspen Superpipe.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"Sometimes I feel I sound like a broken record when I talk about what's technical in the halfpipe and how I'm pushing it,\" James said.\n\n\"There's still only a handful of guys that are really doing switch backside riding.\n\n\"This year the majority of the field is doing two backside hits with three frontside hits, because that's the direction they're pushing.\n\n\"This Games, I'm doing two frontside hits with three backside hits. So that's how I interpret it to be more technical, more difficult, more demanding physically.\"\n\nAs to whether the judges will agree with James's sentiments, only time will tell.\n\nThe men's snowboard halfpipe final gets underway on Saturday morning at 7:05am AEDT.",

(ABC News: Som Patidar)\n\nBNP leader Mr Rahman has pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh's international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Sheikh Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi.\n\nHe has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two\u2011term, 10\u2011year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies.\n\nA victory regardless of the result\n\nTurnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the most recent election in 2024.\n\nLocal media reported that more than 60 per cent of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.\n\nMore than 2,000 candidates \u2014 including many independents \u2014 were on the ballot, and at least 50 parties contested \u2014 a national record.\n\nAlthough many people on the streets had passionate views on their preferred candidates, the one common agreement was the need for a successful election to re-establish democracy.\n\nMohammatul Islam joined millions of other Bangladeshis casting their votes at the general election in Dhaka. (ABC News: Som Patidar)\n\nThe past three Bangladesh elections have been marred by corruption, allegations of vote-rigging and boycotts by opposition parties.\n\nDespite their political differences, people who spoke with the ABC said this election should be celebrated for heralding a new era for the country.\n\nNazmul Haque had not voted for the past three elections, but could not stop smiling while lining up at a polling booth on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm feeling great, so relaxed, that everything is so beautiful, and the atmosphere is so good,\" he said.\n\n\" All I can say is God bless Bangladesh. \"\n\nNazmul Haque returned to vote at Bangladesh's 2026 election after not casting a ballot in the previous three polls. (ABC News: Som Patidar)\n\nOn the streets of Bangladesh, polling check-in stations were adorned with balloons, glittery streamers and fairy lights.\n\nCoffee and biscuits were handed around as people laughed and celebrated the monumental day.\n\nMore than 4 million young voters were also expected to cast their ballot for the first time, including many who participated in the 2024 protests, like Chowdhury Maria Tabassaum.\n\n\"I was a part of [the] 2024 student movement and I'm really proud that now I can practise my rights and my right to vote,\" she said.\n\n\" I put my life at risk in that movement and that's why I am participating in this vote today, and that's why this election is important for me. \"\n\nThe election was a memorable one for first-time voter Chowdhury Maria Tabassaum. (ABC News: Som Patidar)\n\nThe right to vote, without fear of repercussion or violence, was not something many Bangladeshis could imagine just two years ago.\n\nNow, regardless of the outcome of the election, people on the streets say they already have reason to celebrate.\n\nA political lineage\n\nThe election marked a remarkable reversal of fortune for prime minister-elect Tarique Rahman, whose father was a leading independence figure from 1977 to 1981 until he was assassinated.\n\nMr Rahman left the country in 2008 saying he needed medical treatment after being released from detention under a military\u2011backed caretaker administration.\n\nHe had been held after a crackdown on corruption.\n\nTarique Rahman, whose mother died last year, has pledged to diversify Bangladesh's industries, attract investment and increase support for the poor. (Reuters)\n\nUnder Sheikh Hasina's rule, Mr Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them.\n\nIn 2018, he was also sentenced to life in prison over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many.\n\nHe has always denied the allegations against him, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina's ouster.\n\nHe returned home to a hero's welcome in December after the youth\u2011driven uprising ended Hasina's rule.\n\nABC/wires",

(ABC Riverina: Nicola Ceccato)\n\nThe group is in line with the national not-for-profit organisation The Men's Table, which consists of a group of men coming together once a month to have intentional discussions about life over dinner.\n\nHe also reached out to Grab Life by the Balls, a charity that organises social events to improve male mental health and wellbeing through mateship, and recently started a Griffith group.\n\n\"What helps men more than anything else is to have three to five close friends they can call on when they're in trouble,\" he said.\n\nCombating loneliness\n\nAccording to Ending Loneliness Together, a group of organisations addressing loneliness in Australia, men are 1.5 times more likely to experience persistent social isolation than women.\n\nCarl Nelms says social connection is important. (Supplied: Carl Nelms)\n\nLead psychologist and founder of Blokes Psychology, Carl Nelms, said casual mateship networks like Grab Life by the Balls could be quite successful in helping men.\n\n\"If there's a connection there, there's camaraderie as well,\" he said.\n\n\" It can enable people to just live a happier and better-quality life if they're feeling socially connected and supported. \"\n\nMr Nelms said a lack of targeted services for men and understanding about how the male brain worked were barriers to accessing support.\n\n\"For many men, they're still largely expected to or expect themselves to be the provider \u2014 so if they're taking time out of their schedule to seek support themselves, unfortunately, things have to be pretty dire to do so,\" Mr Nelms said.\n\nGrab Life by the Balls founder Sam Parker said the issues inspired him to start his charity.\n\nCharity for change\n\nSam Parker is passionate about supporting men and combating male loneliness. (Supplied: Sam Parker)\n\nOriginally from the Leeton area in the western Riverina, Mr Parker said growing up in regional NSW shaped his understanding of how mateship was key to social connection.\n\nThe Men's Table and Grab Life by the Balls have made their way to the Riverina. (ABC Riverina: Nicola Ceccato)\n\n\"Work with dad having beers over the barbed wire fence \u2026 or in the shearing shed,\" Mr Parker said.\n\n\"I think that instilled this blokey way of engaging people \u2014 having a casual chat and staying socially connected.\"\n\nNow in its ninth year, the charity has grown to include 25 groups from across Queensland, the ACT and regional NSW.\n\n\"I wanted to give back and do something for the community and certainly improve the outcomes in men's mental health in regional Australia,\" Mr Cowen said.\n\n\"It's been wonderful.\"",

    "text": "One of the last known people to have seen a foreign-owned barge at sea before it washed up on a remote Australian island says it was being towed by a boat not suited to the job.\n\nThe 100-metre barge Nelly 112 ground to a halt on Athikho Poji, a rocky islet in the Torres Strait, on January 26.\n\nThe Nelly 112 could have drifted up to 2,000 kilometres from Indonesian waters. (Supplied)\n\nA retired commercial skipper with almost four decades of maritime industry experience said he saw the barge off the Balinese coast nine days before it washed up near Badu Island.\n\nAustralian Noel Gaunt said he came within 100 metres of Nelly 112 on January 17 while on a fishing boat offshore from Amed, in northern Bali.\n\nHe said the barge was being towed by a boat he did not believe was suitable for the job.\n\n\"It was not a tug \u2026 it was a [towing vessel] around 50 to 60-feet trying to pull this massive barge [which would be] well in excess of a hundred [tonnes],\" Mr Gaunt said.\n\n\" It's like towing a five-trailer road train in the Pilbara with a Hilux. \"\n\nMr Gaunt, originally from Nelson Bay in regional New South Wales, relocated to Bali last November after being diagnosed with a terminal illness.\n\nNoel Gaunt now lives in Bali after working for 38 years in the Australian maritime industry. (Supplied: Noel Gaunt)\n\nHe said it appeared those towing the barge were trying to keep it in a channel of the Banda Sea to avoid it entering the Timor Sea.\n\n\"It would've caused havoc to go through there because [the towing vessel] wasn't in command of the barge,\" he said.\n\n\"It was struggling every metre that it took.\"\n\nMr Gaunt said he did not know what happened to the barge as it proceeded east.\n\nHowever, that region of Indonesia was hit with severe weather in the days that followed.\n\n\"My guess is they cut it loose to protect the towing vessel and [in that] situation a skipper would,\" Mr Gaunt said.\n\n\" It's the safety of life at sea. You've got to look after yourself [and] he would've had crew. \"\n\nMr Gaunt said it was plausible currents had caused the barge to drift 2,000 kilometres over nine days toward the Torres Strait.\n\nFinders can't call 'keepers'\n\nA salvage team has been contracted to return the barge to Indonesia \"as soon as practicable\", according to Maritime Safety Queensland (MSQ).\n\nMaritime Safety Queensland says it won't disclose the name of the barge owner due to privacy reasons. (Supplied)\n\nBadu Island traditional owner Edmund Tamwoy had hoped he could claim the barge given it washed up on his country.\n\nBut Dr Rosemary Gibson from the University of Queensland's marine and shipping law unit said the concept of \"finders keepers\" did not exist under maritime law.\n\n\"Where you do have an owner and the vessel is registered somewhere we can trace it,\" she said.\n\n\" There's nothing to stop them from purchasing the vessel but they wouldn't just be able to tie a rope around it and declare it theirs. \"\n\nDr Rosemary Gibson says the mystery barge can't simply be claimed. (Supplied: University of Queensland)\n\nMr Tamwoy has since told the ABC he was trying to contact the barge owner to make an offer to buy it.\n\nDr Gibson cautioned against making a bid without properly costing the salvage, repairs and on-going maintenance.\n\n\"There are administrative hurdles that you then have to go through,\" she said.\n\n\"You'd be wanting to factor all those things in as to whether it's actually worthwhile.\"\n\nNo timeline has been given as to when authorised inspectors would travel to Badu Island. (Supplied)\n\nMSQ said it had arranged to inspect the barge.\n\nHowever, a spokesman gave no timeline as to when its inspectors would travel to Badu Island.\n\nMSQ said it was unable to disclose the name of the barge owner for privacy reasons.\n\nThe ABC has contacted an Indonesian shipping company which launched Nelly 112 for comment.",

    "text": "Things have simply not gone to plan for Australia's men's snowboard cross riders at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games.\n\nAnd to be honest how could any of the men competing be focused when one of their teammates was recovering from a broken neck suffered just days before?\n\nThe desperate toll of Aussie injuries at the Winter Games Games-ending injuries to Cam Bolton and Misaki Vaughan have emphasised the dangers of winter sport as the Australian team copes with issues early in the Milano Cortina Games.\n\nLosing Cam Bolton put the entire squad on the back foot, and there they remained, with none of the three riders making it past the round of 16 on day six in Livigno.\n\nAnd although all three riders tried to play it down, the trials and tribulations all have faced in recent weeks clearly played a role in their respective performances, with Adam Lambert particularly emotional when speaking about his good friend.\n\n\"I never want to see a teammate, let alone a friend, go down with such a terrible injury,\" a teary Lambert said after his race.\n\n\"He's playing it down but it's hard to watch somebody who you've looked up to your whole life go out like that, and then have to get airlifted to hospital.\n\n\"Yeah, it affected me a little bit. I tried to not let it affect me, but \u2026\" he said, before trailing off.\n\nSnowboard cross is one of many dangerous sports at the Winter Games. (Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\nLambert had come into this Olympics in career-best form.\n\nNot only was Lambert the FIS World Cup series leader but had claimed a first ever career World Cup medal in Dongbeiya after eight years of trying.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Fourth place in the first heat is definitely not the level of riding that I've been showing this year,\" Lambert said.\n\n\"It wasn't my greatest performance. Pretty disappointed overall, obviously, but my training over the last few days definitely indicated I was better than that.\"\n\nSo much has been made of the injuries that have torn through the Australian team to start this Olympics, but none have been as badly affected as the snowboard cross team.\n\nGet the latest: Winter Olympics day six: Australia wins first gold as US great pipped in halfpipe Stay across the highs and lows of the Games with the ABC Sport Daily podcast and ABC Sport.\n\nIt was only in the weeks before the Games that former world champion Belle Brockhoff, who broke her back in March last year and finished in fourth at the last Olympics, was finally forced to retire from the sport as a result of her injuries.\n\nBrockhoff had contested the mixed team event in Beijing with Bolton, finishing ninth.\n\nNow both were facing lengthy recovery periods.\n\n'They were the ones that believed, not me'\n\nEven one of the athletes who did make the start line in Livigno, Jarryd Hughes, only just made it.\n\nThe 30-year-old suffered a horror foot injury 10 months ago at Mont Sainte Anne when his navicular bone splintered, threatening his career.\n\nHe can barely walk and only had four days on snow before qualifying for the Games, and the toll it is taking on him is severe.\n\nAfter his seeding runs earlier in the day he was left doubled over, pain etched across his face as clearly as the gouges in the snow on course.\n\nJarryd Hughes arguably shouldn't be competing thanks to a badly broken foot. (Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\n\"Oh, astronomical,\" Hughes said of the impact his injury has had on him.\n\n\"I mean \u2026 I didn't think I would make these Games, let alone be on snow at this point.\n\n\"Between our medical staff and everybody who's helped out \u2014 because there's a massive crew to get me back to this point \u2014 they were the ones that believed, not me.\"\n\nHughes, who confirmed that this Olympics would be his last competition, said getting to the start line was an achievement in itself.\n\n\"It's been nice to be able to do it because the last 10 months has been kind of hell,\" he said.\n\n\"I couldn't walk for four months, and then trying to get back on a snowboard and try and compete at the top level.\n\n\"It's nice to be here and compete at my fourth Olympics. I didn't think I would come to one Olympics, most people didn't think I was good enough to do it when I was younger. So to now be standing here at my fourth it's pretty incredible.\"\n\n'Bittersweet' debut\n\nJames Johnstone faced a steep learning curve after being added late to the squad. (Getty Images: Patrick Smith)\n\nThe emotional toll that Bolton's injury had on the squad was in evidence even before the competition got underway.\n\nJimmy Johnstone was only told on Tuesday that he would be competing, his obvious excitement and enthusiasm tempered by the disappointment and concern he held for his role model.\n\n\"Obviously it's bittersweet with everything that's happened with Cam,\" the 21-year-old said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Cam, for me, has been a massive role model and inspiration for me in my snowboard cross career.\n\n\"He's been a really good teammate to me the last year or so since I came onto the World Cup team, so to see him go out like that it's a real shame and I'm gutted for him.\"\n\nJames Johnstone led his heat at one point, before being overrun. (Getty Images: Adam Pretty)\n\nAfter the race, as the snow fell and the wind howled, turning what had been a warm day into a chilly one, Johnstone said he had been in touch with Bolton.\n\n\"He earned this spot and he was going to compete, and, in my opinion, he was a medal chance,\" Johnstone said.\n\n\"So it's devastating for him.\n\n\"But it's an opportunity for me, and he sent me a message and I was texting back and forth with him and I said to him 'mate, this is for you and I'll be doing it for you and I'll leave it all out there'.\n\n\"He gave me a few words of encouragement which was really nice.\n\n\"I hope he's doing alright, from what I hear he's doing OK. It's a crazy moment and it's such a shame.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe 21-year-old may well be blessed to be at the Games but he is clearly no slouch.\n\nIn 2023 he was crowned junior world champion in Italy at Passo San Pellegrino and has had 15 starts on the World Cup circuit with a career high of 24th.\n\nThis year he has mostly been competing on the Europa Cup circuit where he sits fifth overall.\n\nSince the last World Cup event in Dongbeiya, Johnstone has competed six times in France and Austria so is certainly race sharp.\n\nBut his lack of practise on the Olympic course showed as he finished 30th-fastest in the seeding round.\n\nAlthough he raced to the front at the start of his heat he was unable to finish it off and went out of the competition.\n\nPrior to getting on course for the first qualification run Johnstone had only ever been down it three times \u2014 far too few to get a proper read on conditions or the character of the course, especially for someone so young and relatively inexperienced.",

(Supplied: Fleurs de Lyonville)\n\nHe said even growers who did not lose their crops could have had their plans disrupted by above-average temperatures.\n\n\"If they were growing a specific crop for Valentine's Day it might have come in a couple of weeks earlier, [even] if it wasn't impacted quality-wise,\" he said.\n\nDespite this, he dic not anticipate problems filling the triple volume of orders for the occasion.\n\nRyan Musson says the Australian wildflower supply has also suffered from drought. (Supplied: Wafex)\n\n\"There will be some crops that are not around this Valentine's Day that maybe some florists or the public are used to seeing,\" he said.\n\n\"But there'll certainly be a large variety of other locally grown flowers \u2026 to substitute for any of the issues we've seen.\"",

Norway \u2014 7 gold, 2 silver, 5 bronze\n\nNorway has won five medals (two gold and three bronze) in cross-country skiing, one of each colour in speed skating, a gold and silver in ski jumping, gold and bronze in biathlon, while Birk Ruud and Jens Luraas Oftebro nabbed golds in slopestyle skiing and nordic combined.\n\n2. Italy \u2014 6 gold, 3 silver, 8 bronze\n\nThe host nation has more total medals than any team, split across a slew of events.\n\nThe six golds came in women's super-G alpine skiing, men's and women's doubles luge, the short-track speed skating mixed team relay, and the women's 3,000m and 5,000m speed skating (both to Francesca Lollobrigida).\n\n3. USA \u2014 4 gold, 7 silver, 3 bronze\n\nBreezy Johnson won the women's downhill. (Getty Images: NurPhoto/Andrzej Iwanczuk)\n\nThe Americans picked up gold \u2014 which immediately broke \u2014 in women's downhill skiing thanks to Breezy Johnson and Liz Lemley capitalising on Jakara Anthony's stumble.\n\nThe US also showed off their skating brilliance with gold in the team event figure skating and Jordan Stolz won the men's 1,000m speed skating.\n\nTheir 10 minor medals in moguls, slopestyle, super-G, cross-country skiing, curling, ice dance, luge and snowboard halfpipe keep them ahead of their fellow quadruple-gold winners.\n\n4. Germany \u2014 4 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze\n\nThe Germans have dominated with five medals in the luge, winning the men's and women's singles and the team relay, picking up silver and bronze in the women's and men's doubles too.\n\nPhilipp Raimund also won gold in the men's normal hill ski-jumping, while the women's alpine skiing crew picked up two silvers in individual and team downhill skiing.\n\nThey also took bronze in the mixed biathlon relay.\n\n5.

    "text": "Tottenham Hotspur are \"not a big club\" because of their policy in the transfer market, former manager Ange Postecoglou has said in the wake of the London club's sacking of head coach Thomas Frank on Wednesday.\n\nFrank replaced Postecoglou after the Australian was sacked despite winning the Europa League last season, but struggled and left with his side in 16th position in the Premier League, five \u200cpoints above the relegation zone.\n\n\"When you look at their expenditure and particularly their wages structure, they're not a big club,\" Postecoglou told The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast.\n\n\"I saw that because \u200cwhen we were trying to sign players we weren't in the market for those players.\"\n\nPostecoglou took Tottenham to fifth in his first season in \u200ccharge but they failed to build on that and finished \u200c17th in his second campaign, despite winning the Europa League to end a 17-year wait for silverware.\n\nHe said the club's reluctance to compete with the Premier League's big hitters in the transfer market was holding it back.\n\n\"I think they didn't realise that \u200cto actually win you've got to take some risks,\" he said.\n\n\"I felt like Tottenham as a club were saying 'we're one of the big boys', and the reality is I don't think they are.\"\n\nFrank \u200cwas Tottenham's fifth full-time manager \u200csince the popular Mauricio Pochettino was sacked in 2019, months after leading them to the Champions \u200cLeague final.\n\nOne of the major gripes of the club's fan base is they fail to land their transfer targets.\n\nFrank had hoped to \u200csign Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White last summer but he stayed at Forest while Arsenal beat Tottenham to the signing of Eberechi Eze.\n\nPostecoglou, who was sacked by Nottingham Forest after 39 days in charge earlier this season, suggests Frank did not realise the type of structure he was walking into.\n\n\"There's no guarantee whichever manager you bring in. They've had world-class managers there and they \u200chaven't had success. \u200cAnd for what reason?\" he said.\n\n\"Thomas is walking in and what's his objective? What's the club's objective?

Got it Share A A A\n\nKey points MUSIC: Remarkably, Geese live up to the hype at their Thornbury gig\n\nTHEATRE: Cluedo at the Comedy Theatre is a zany mystery with a dose of nostalgia\n\nMUSIC\n\nGeese \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Croxton, February 12 An hour and a half before buzzy New York four-piece Geese are due on stage, there\u2019s two lines of people on the footpath outside: one waiting to get in, the other sheepishly holding up signs for tickets: \u201cFriend didn\u2019t show up? I\u2019ll buy your ticket,\u201d reads one. Another: \u201cThis Goose has no tix\u201d. Frontman Cameron Winter performs with Geese at The Croxton on Thursday, February 12. Martin Philbey Gooses they were. Ever since 23-year-old frontman Cameron Winter\u2019s wonky, astonishing solo LP Heavy Metal grew from late-2024 curiosity into revered modern classic, the cult of Cameron has turbocharged Geese\u2019s trajectory. When Winter\u2019s Tuesday night solo piano show at The Forum went on sale in August 2025, it sold out instantly. In September, Geese released their third LP, the knotty Getting Killed, to rapturous reception. It means here now, on their debut Australian tour for Laneway Festival, both Winter and Geese could have played at venues three times the size, many times over. For one night only in High Street in Thornbury, it feels like being at the molten centre of the music universe. Shockingly, Geese live up to the hype. Augmented by keyboard player Sam Revaz, Geese demonstrate they\u2019re far more than their famous frontman\u2019s backing band, with a dissonant clinic of sizzling indie rock, laced with prog, blues, punk, folk and anything else ever made with guitars. Somehow, nothing\u2019s ornamental, no one slacks off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the opening slow burn of Husbands, the rammed crowd yell every word of Winter\u2019s knack for self-flagellation: \u201cI\u2019m falling apart\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve been hit by the bus of life\u201d, \u201cBaby, you can change and still choose me\u201d. They blast through all of Getting Killed and a couple of songs from 3D Country (2023), including an unhinged 2122, inspiring the first circle pit of the night. Geese are the most exciting new band, and a damn marvel to see. Martin Philbey There\u2019s a wild vibrancy to Geese live that just isn\u2019t present on the airtight audio of their records. New chordal passages emerge as guitarist Emily Green and drummer Max Bassin lead odd, telekinetic choices \u2013 where Winter was his own wry agent of chaos at Tuesday\u2019s intimate solo show, tonight he\u2019s the steely, charismatic fulcrum around which Geese expands and contracts. Cobra, Au Pays du Cocaine and Taxes are gorgeous, given a spectral heft in this quasi-religious setting, while 100 Horses and the set-closing barnstormers, Long Island City Here I Come and Trinidad put the crowd on spin cycle. The rumours are true: Geese are the most exciting new band, and a damn marvel to see. You\u2019re a goose if you missed it.\n\nReviewed by Marcus Teague\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHEATRE\n\nCluedo \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nComedy Theatre, until March 15 Every generation from the Boomers down knows Cluedo. Editions of the game have been around since 1949, and kids tend to learn what a murder mystery is by playing it \u2013 well before they\u2019re introduced to Agatha Christie. The usual suspects ham it up in Cluedo. Eddie Jim Childhood nostalgia for the franchise undergirds this commercial comedy. It adapts Jonathan Lynn\u2019s 1985 film Clue (a box office flop that developed a cult following) and a talented cast embraces the zaniness of a show that\u2019s feather-light on suspense and plot but slathered with mildly diverting drollery. Six usual suspects are invited to an English country house under the assumed names of characters from the game \u2013 Professor Plum (David James), Miss Scarlett (Olivia Deeble), Mrs Peacock (Genevieve Lemon), Colonel Mustard (Adam Murphy), Mrs White (Rachael Beck) and Reverend Green (Laurence Boxhall).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019re greeted by the butler Wadsworth (Grant Piro), French maid Yvette (Lib Campbell) and a dour knife-wielding Cook (Octavia Barron-Martin). When their elusive host Mr Boddy (Joshua Monaghan) appears, it\u2019s only for long enough to reveal sinister designs before adding to the body count. What follows is a chaotic hunt for the killer(s) that gets serially interrupted by yet more potential victims, and features a blend of ridiculous sight gags, exaggerated caricature, inane banter and comforting in-jokes, and tightly choreographed physical humour with strong elements of revolving-door farce. Cluedo is cosy, well-turned commercial entertainment. Eddie Jim Each actor confects moments in the spotlight. They all have fun playing with genre stereotype, though it\u2019s Piro\u2019s butler who acts as a kind of MC and gives the most versatile (and ludicrous) performance, with Boxhall\u2019s neurotic, jelly-limbed slapstick not far behind. Production values are high, the set and costume design on par with the style of murder mystery theatre \u2013 think The Mousetrap \u2013 that Cluedo merrily lampoons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Melbourne live reviews Tradition and modernity collide in this story of loneliness I\u2019d like to see a push towards more diverse casting in shows of this ilk. The play\u2019s nominal setting in 1940s England hardly calls for historical accuracy or naturalism when it\u2019s based on a game played by everyone, and the familiarity Cluedo trades on might have even broader appeal if it better reflected contemporary Australian audiences. That said, Cluedo isn\u2019t envelope-pushing stuff. Nor is it \u201ca killer night out\u201d as billboards claim. No, it\u2019s undemanding comedy \u2013 a cosy, well-turned commercial entertainment that doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.

    "text": "Qualifying: fire in the belly In Olympic moguls, there is a field of 30 athletes, and two initial stages of qualifying. In the first, the top 10 go through to the finals, held the next day. The rest have to go again, and in that second run, the bottom 10 of the remaining 20 are eliminated. Woods came 15th on his first attempt with a score of 73.67. His family\u2019s reaction was disappointment; not in him, but how the judges assessed his performance, though he later revealed he not only shared their view, but that it motivated him. So the next day, after a check-in with his sports psychiatrist, he came out breathing fire, putting down a vastly-improved 80.46 - the best score by any competitor in the second round of qualifiers, and the second-best from the entire field to that point.\n\n\u201cI was a bit pissed off at the judges from the day before,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI was pretty fired up. I was going out there with vengeance. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m leaving nothing on the table. You guys can\u2019t score me low.\u2019 \u201cI was in the gate with my coach, and there were probably a couple of explicit words just before we dropped in to get [me] really fired up.\u201d Suddenly, confidence was flowing. Final one: pressure makes diamonds But Woods knew he had to up the ante to mix it with the medal contenders.\n\nThere are two jumps in moguls, each positioned between all the bumpy snow; in his qualifiers, he performed a back full and an off-axis 720 grab, but he felt that wasn\u2019t going to be enough for the finals. Not only did he plan to go faster, but he wanted to add an extra degree of difficulty to his top jump. \u201cOriginally heading into the first final, we were going to go back to the qualification two run, because we scored so well. Then we had a couple of opportunities in finals training, and I just wasn\u2019t missing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Let\u2019s go all in. We\u2019re at the Olympics. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat meant adding an extra 360-degree spin to the back full, turning it into what\u2019s called a back double full. In the first final, only eight of the 20 skiers progress for a shot at the podium. From being middle of the road on Wednesday, Woods scored a stunning 83.60 - the best of the round, meaning he would be last to jump in the decisive run. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually realise that I was the top qualifier of that round. It was only until I started putting my skis on that my coach told me,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I kind of freaked out a little bit.\u201d Final two: all on the line\n\nWith his Olympic dreams on the line, Woods was locked in. The plan was simple: rinse and repeat. \u201cI kept reminding myself that it is a pleasure to drop last,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never dropped last in my career, and I was dropping last behind some serious heavy hitters. I just need to relax up there, got a good coach, he kept me dialled in. I was pretty bloody nervous \u2026 [but] I knew what I had to do.\u201d While he was waiting for his turn, for the first time - and only because he was feeling so good about himself - Woods allowed his coach to let him in on what the seven other competitors were doing, and how they were scoring. He even saw some of it for himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a game plan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have so many awesome staff that are videoing and analysing other people \u2026 They were pretty straight up on what I needed to do and I needed to trust them and believe in that. I heard there was another 83 that got scored when I was up top and I was like, \u2018Oh my goodness.\u2019 It\u2019s a big mountain to get a score like that \u2026 the coach that I had up top, he was like, \u2018Stay disciplined. Do the same thing.\u2019 \u201cIt worked out.\u201d The score to beat for gold was 83.71, from Canadian veteran Mikael Kingsbury, widely considered one of the greatest moguls skiers of all time, who went just before him, the seventh of the eight still in contention. This was his final Olympics, and after winning gold in 2018 and silver in 2022 in this event, he was aiming to finish as champion again. And it looked like he might have done enough \u2026 until Woods dropped in.\n\nHe produced the same score, 83.71. In those situations, the tiebreaker is the turns score, or how the panel of judges assesses how they handled skiing on the moguls, and how smoothly and straight they moved. That was the difference. Woods\u2019 turn score was 48.4, while Kingsbury\u2019s was 47.7 \u2013 so he won gold, upsetting one of the sport\u2019s true GOATs in the most high-pressure way imaginable, with the last run of an Olympic final. \u201cHe kind of ticked all the boxes,\u201d said teammate Jackson Harvey. \u201cHe jumped really well, execution on the jumps was close to perfect and his skiing was very composed.\u201d\n\nLoading What got him over the line was his precision and attention to detail. \u201cJust the overall cleanliness of it,\u201d said teammate Matt Graham, who lifted Woods in the air when the final scores were revealed. \u201cHe connected the dots, it was seamless. Landed the top air really well and just skied out, didn\u2019t make a mistake \u2026 whereas Mick made a little mistake in the middle, and then I think they were both pretty similar in time.\u201d The Winter Olympic Games is broadcast on the 9Network, 9Now and Stan Sport.",

Be grateful that you had it at all. So today I want to express gratitude to the Liberal Party that I have belonged to and loved for more than half of my adult life, to the party room that elected me as their leader nine months ago, and to the Parliament of Australia that has been the most extraordinary workplace for 25 years.\"\n\n---\n\nThe group representing 80 Aboriginal community-controlled representative organisations says local networks are key to Closing the Gap.\n\nOf the 19 Closing the Gap targets, four are on track to be completed, with a further six improving.\n\nIn his annual Closing the Gap speech to parliament, Anthony Albanese says the federal government is determined to achieve the targets.\n\nHe has announced extra funding for services like the 24-hour Indigenous crisis support hotline 13YARN.\n\nThe deputy co-covenor of Coalition of Peaks, Scott Wilson, says the support is welcome and the effort to improve outcomes must continue.\n\n\"We welcome the further investments that were announced that by the prime minister in the House of Reps in employment, food security and access to mental health services. They are not abstract policy areas. They go directly to whether our people can live with dignity, stability and hope.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Aboriginal Legal Service in New South Wales and the ACT is calling for more action on Indigenous deaths in custody.\n\nNadine Miles, from the Aboriginal Legal Service in New South Wales and the ACT, says data shows more Indigenous deaths in custody have been recorded this year, on top of last year's record-high number.\n\nAboriginal people now make up over a third of adults in New South Wales prisons.\n\nMs Miles says the high incarceration rate and tough-on-crime policies are diverting the focus from strategies like prevention and investing in frontline and local Aboriginal services.\n\n---\n\nThe powerful reach of radio is being celebrated on World Radio Day.\n\nOne broadcaster who loves the medium is Sagar Mehrotra who has spent the past 22 years of his career at Indian Link Radio.\n\nHe told SBS Hindi, radio is even more powerful today because of the use of the internet which enables content to reach even more people through digital platforms.\n\n\"Radio is a product that can reach to millions and gazillions. TV, you can't have it in your car, TV, you can't have it in while in the air. But radio is something that if you have the slightest internet connection these days, you have the reach. You have that facility not just to listen but to interact, TV doesn't give you that.\"\n\n---\n\nTo sport and in hockey, Australia's Kookaburras have secured their second win of the FIH Pro League Hobart block against Germany, defeating the visitors 3\u20130 in Tasmania.\n\nIt was a disciplined start from Australia, who absorbed early German pressure before building momentum through strong defensive structure and controlled possession.\n\nWith back-to-back wins on home soil, the Kookaburras now turn their attention to a Friday night clash against Pakistan.",

I don't like you guys using this bathroom and this shower because there's a danger you'll just fall through'.\"\n\n\"That was a bit scary to hear,\" they said. \"But nothing's really been fixed. It's pretty dire.\"\n\nPat says the foundation of their rental is dangerous and has water damage, including black mould. Still they faced a rental increase. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Pat and their housemates were notified of a $70-a-week rental increase, they decided to end the lease.\n\n\"Our response to the rent increase would have been different if the house had been cared for.\"\n\nNow, they're worried about finding a new rental to move into. Despite all housemates working full-time, Pat says they're all still struggling to manage rent in Australia's most expensive rental market.\n\n\"It's not the most extreme rent increase I've ever experienced, but it's tough at the moment,\" they said. \"It feels pretty disheartening.\"\n\nPat said they had fears that challenging the rent increase would backfire.\n\n\"I feel like if we say we feel the rent increase is unfair because of the lack of care shown to the home, I'm worried they're going to kick us out or say that we're difficult tenants to the next place we try and rent.\"\n\nFaced with a rental increase in a \"dangerous\" run-down home, Pat is looking for somewhere else to live. But even with a full-time job, they're worried about how they'll afford it. Source: Supplied\n\nRental affordability hits record low\n\nPat's experience reflects a broader trend unfolding across the country.\n\nThe cost of renting in Australia has risen at more than double the pace of wages over the past five years, pushing rental affordability to record lows.\n\nNew analysis by property research firm Cotality found national rents rose 43.9 per cent in the five years to September 2025, compared with wage growth of 17.5 per cent over the same period.\n\nNew analysis by property research firm Cotality found national rents rose 43.9 per cent in the five years to September 2025, compared with wage growth of 17.5 per cent over the same period. Source: SBS News\n\nAs a result, rental households are now spending an average 33.4 per cent of their pre-tax income on rent \u2014 the highest level on record. That compares with a decade average of 29.2 per cent and a recent low of 26.2 per cent in the September quarter of 2020.\n\nHousing is generally considered affordable when renters spend no more than 30 per cent of their income on rent.\n\nThe widening gap reflects persistently low vacancy rates, shrinking household sizes, and a lack of new housing supply coming online, Cotality said.\n\nWestern Australia hit hardest\n\nWA recorded the sharpest rental growth in the nation, with rents climbing 66 per cent over five years, while wages rose just 18.5 per cent.\n\n\"Nowhere is the pressure more evident than in Western Australia, where rents have climbed by around two-thirds in just five years,\" Cotality research director Tim Lawless said.\n\n\"Even with wages growing a little faster than the national average, they have come nowhere near keeping up with housing costs in that state.\"\n\nWA recorded the sharpest rental growth in the nation, with rents climbing 66 per cent over five years, while wages rose just 18.5 per cent. Source: SBS News\n\nThe ACT was the only market where rent and wage growth were close to aligned, with rents rising 18.5 per cent and wages increasing 17.8 per cent over the five years to September 2025.\n\n\"In the ACT, income growth has managed to track rental growth more closely, which has helped contain the deterioration in affordability compared with other parts of the country,\" Lawless said.\n\nA bleak outlook\n\nCotality's analysis shows rental growth has been accelerating since mid-2025, with demand continuing to outstrip supply.\n\n\"With vacancy rates still around record lows in many markets and new housing completions running below what is needed to meet population growth, it is hard to see rents materially easing in the near term,\" Lawless said.\n\n\"Unless wage growth accelerates meaningfully, or we see a step change in rental supply, the risk is that affordability will deteriorate further for lower-income households in particular.\"\n\nHe said measures to boost housing supply \u2014 including more build-to-rent developments, incentives for private investment, and planning reforms to allow greater density in well-located areas \u2014 would be critical to easing pressure on renters.\n\n\"Closing the gap between rent and income growth will require a coordinated effort across governments, industry and investors,\" he said.\n\n\"The sooner we can bring more supply to market, the sooner renters will start to see some relief.\"\n\nFor Pat, that outlook offers little reassurance.\n\nDespite having a secure full-time job and a stable income, Pat says it's still \"really difficult\" to find somewhere to live in Sydney.\n\n\"If you're single and you're trying to find somewhere to live, that's a big part of your income. It's a substantial part of my pay each week,\" they said, adding that each move has pushed them further away from the city.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nEvery year, the federal government releases data on what are known as Closing the Gap targets.\n\nThe Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, says they're a set of goals agreed on between state and federal governments, and the Indigenous organisation Coalition of Peaks, to improve the lives of First Nations Australians.\n\n\u201cYou have the right to a full and equal place in our nation and our future. Unburdened by discrimination or disadvantage. Empowered by opportunity and security. That is the test - and the purpose - of Closing the Gap.\u201d\n\nThere are 19 Gap targets in total.\n\n\u201cThe Closing the Gap targets are a measure of our national progress - and there is real progress. Four targets are on track. And based on progress to date, later this year we expect confirmation that the target of 95 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children enrolled in preschool has been achieved. A further six targets are improving. And that number is based on the national average.\u201d\n\nThe PM says there are also four areas where progress has stalled, or going backwards: namely youth incarceration, child removal, early development, and suicide.\n\n\u201cThe most urgent is suicide. Suicide shatters families, it tears apart communities. So often amidst the grief, loved ones return to the heartbreaking question: how did it come to this? Compared to non-Indigenous Australians, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are two and a half times more likely to die by suicide. \u201c\n\nThe figures on First Nations involvement in the justice system are also especially troubling.\n\nFirst Nations children are 27 times more like ly to be in youth detention than their non-Indigenous peers and 10 times more likely to be in out-of-home care.\n\nFor Catherine Liddle, from the national Indigenous organisation for children SNAICC, it's no surprise that young people feature so heavily in the report.\n\n\u201cI think today's report reinforces what SNAICC has always known and what I know as deputy convener is that Closing the Gap starts with our children. The story of children was at the heart of the tabling of the report today. And when you think about all the conditions that our children need to be thriving, they were mentioned in that report.\u201d\n\nThe government already hopes the appointment of a permanent Indigenous children's commissioner will have a positive impact here.\n\nBut their approach has already come under heavy criticism, with Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe saying $230 million was recently funnelled to Northern Territory police rather than to community-led solutions.\n\nMs Thorpe says communities must keep the pressure on the Minister for Indigenous Affairs to move beyond rhetoric and deliver material results.\n\n\u201cI only spoke to an elder yesterday who reeled off the number of reports and recommendations in her 50 years of working in youth justice and child protection, and she said, we are sick of it. Our people are dying. And I echo her sentiments because that Commissioner's role needs to have teeth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in New South Wales alone, the number of Indigenous people in jail is higher than ever before.\n\nNumbers from the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research show First Nations people represent more than a third of the state's prison population - the highest number and proportion on record - despite making up three per cent of the general population.\n\nThe Indigenous Affairs Minister, Malarndirri McCarthy, says it's proved a challenge to address incarceration and other justice issues because of the different legal frameworks and policies in systems around the country.\n\nBut she says she remains keen to make progress by working with First Nations communities.\n\n\u201cWe must do it in collaboration with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community across Australia, and that is through the Coalition of Peaks. That is why we have the Joint Council twice a year to look at some of the structural and systemic change that has to occur. But also in terms of doing it partnership to see the changes for First Nations people.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Anthony Albanese maintains the latest Closing the Gap figures are not a bad news story.\n\n\u201cWe are now five years away from most of the target deadlines. We are clear about where there is more to do. We must also guard against talk of failure, because talk of failure dismisses the aspirations and achievements of Indigenous Australians. It ignores the leaders and communities who are changing lives. Failure is a word for those who have stopped trying - or given up listening.\u201d\n\nScott Wilson from the Coalition of Peaks agrees.\n\nHe says the announcements on boosting health funding to Aboriginal health organisations, mental health services, and even funding to remote stores to help keep food fresh are all good initiatives.\n\nBut he says the government must commit to putting its money where its mouth is.\n\n\u201cWe also need to be honest. Investments like the ones announced today must be backed up by ongoing sustainable funding. Our organisations need certainty to plan, to employ people and retain staff, and to deliver lasting change - not just survive from one funding round to the other.\u201d\n\nFor culturally appropriate Indigenous support call 13 YARN.. a 24 hour national telephone helpline on 13 92 76 which provides support across a range of issues including mental health. https://www.13yarn.org.au/\n\nOr call Lifeline 13 11 14\n\n1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732)\n\nMen's Referral Service 1300 766 491",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nAngus Taylor has officially resigned his front bench role as Shadow Minister for Defence to challenge for the Liberal leadership, ending months of speculation surrounding Sussan Ley\u2019s position.\n\nMs Ley took to social media ((Instagram and X)), leaning into the Liberal Party\u2019s tradition of three-line slogans, posting: \"We will take the pressure off families, fix the budget, and keep Australia safe.\"\n\nWhen Ms Ley initially got the leadership position following the 2025 election defeat, she defeated Mr Taylor by only four votes, making her vulnerable from the beginning.\n\nMr Taylor also took to social media ((Instagram and X)) to confirm his bid for the leadership.\n\n\"The Labor government has failed and the Liberal Party has lost its way. I'm running to be the leader of the Liberal Party because I believe that Australia is worth fighting for. I believe we need strong and decisive leadership that gives Australians clarity, courage and confidence in providing a vision for the future. We must start by holding this failing Labor government to account for their total mismanagement of our country and advocate for solutions to the problems that Australians are facing. I'm dedicated to serving you, the Australian people, and giving you a strong alternative that re enlivens the Great Australian Dream.\"\n\nFollowing the decision by Mr Taylor to quit the front bench, a series of staggered resignations has been orchestrated to trigger a party room spill.\n\nTo date, six frontbenchers have resigned from their positions including Mr Taylor, with more expected to announce their resignations.\n\nSenator Jonno Duniam, Senator James Paterson, Senator Matt O\u2019Sullivan, Shadow Minister Claire Chandler, and Shadow Assistant Minister Philip Thompson all quit their posts in a coordinated move.\n\nThe resignations began with the recently appointed Shadow Minister for Cyber Security and Science, the Senator for Tasmania, Claire Chandler.\n\n\"In recent weeks, I've been contacted every day by Tasmanians, by Australians who feel that the Liberal Party has let them down. They don't see an opposition that is tackling the Albanese government head on and holding them accountable for their failures. They just see an opposition that is obsessed with talking about itself. Now I know that the Liberal Party is better than this, but in recent days, I've come with a view that that's not going to happen under the current leadership, and that's why today I've resigned from the front bench.\"\n\nHowever, a loyal faction of Liberals is rallying to defend Ms Ley.\n\nProminent supporters, including MP Tim Wilson, MP Andrew Wallace, and high-profile moderate Senator Andrew Bragg, are pushing back against the spill.\n\nMr Bragg told Sky News that the challenge is premature, insisting that Ms Ley deserves at least one year in the role to prove her leadership.\n\n\"Sussan has policies which are ready to go. Housing stuff, immigration stuff, and I think she ought to be given an opportunity to do that work. As I say, the last few months have been, I think, a particularly difficult time to be the opposition leader. It's always probably the hardest job in Australia. But I think Sussan has been dealt a pretty difficult hand. She's a tough person, and I think she ought to be given more time in the role. And as I think most normal people would expect 12 months in a job is at least a reasonable attempt.\"\n\nSo far, Mr Taylor is backed by Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson, Senator Jess Collins, Shadow Minister for Finance James Paterson, and Phillip Thompson, the Shadow Assistant Minister for Defence and the NDIS.\n\nResponding to questions regarding the ousting of the Liberal Party\u2019s first female leader, Senator Paterson is insisting the challenge is about merit rather than gender.\n\nHe says that the verdict on Ms Ley\u2019s leadership is now very clear.\n\n\"Newspoll shows she's at negative 39 personal approval rating. That is the worst performance of an opposition leader in 23 years. You have to go back to Simon Crean. You have to go back to 2003 and Simon Crean to find an opposition leader who has polled so badly. Sometimes Prime Ministers can recover from bad opinion polls, but it is very difficult for opposition leaders to do so, and I don't believe she'll do so.\"\n\nSenator Henderson says she has sympathy for Sussan Ley but is throwing her support behind Mr Taylor, as she believes he will prioritise the interests of the Australian people.\n\nShe is warning that the Liberal Party is facing its most dire situation since 1994, noting the stark contrast between current polling and the 45.5% primary vote Tony Abbott secured upon becoming Prime Minister.\n\nCiting the latest Newspoll, which places the Coalition's primary vote at just 18% - Senator Henderson says that a leadership change is essential to avoid a total wipe out in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"Angus is very experienced. He's very principled. He's got a wonderful background as a business person. He's got a great empathy with regional Australians. And he's very determined, he's very courageous, and he's very focused on our values. One of the difficulties I have had is that when I wanted to take forward some really important amendments to a very bad Labor bill to prosecute the case for us to step up in the national interest on immigration policy and cap foreign students to make sure that we managed our migration program in the national interest. I was forced across the floor to prosecute what I felt was a really strong common sense policy, which had a lot of support from my colleagues. I don't believe that was consistent with Liberal values, and I believe we will see some very strong, courageous leadership from Angus.\"\n\nAt least six candidates are currently vying for the deputy leadership, with some reports that MP Zoe McKenzie might enter the race.\n\nSenator Sarah Henderson is publicly backing Jane Hume for deputy leader, despite the rarity of a leader being based in the Senate.\n\nTraditionally, the position belongs to a member of the House of Representatives to sit alongside the party leader.\n\nThe last Senator to hold the deputy Liberal leadership was Western Australian Senator Fred Chaney, who served in the role from 1989 to 1990.\n\nSenator Henderson is arguing that Senator Hume and Mr Taylor would recreate the outstanding partnership they shared as Shadow Treasurer and Shadow Finance Minister under Peter Dutton.\n\n\"I mean, this is, of course, yet to be sorted through, and there's only been various speculation. But I do hope Jane puts up her hand. I think they would be a very formidable combination. There's no ticket, of course, but I do hope that Jane puts up her hand.\"\n\nProminent conservative frontbenchers, including Michaelia Cash and Shadow Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Dan Tehan, have yet to announce their intentions.\n\nAs the wave of departures continues, Ms Ley is remaining active on social media.\n\nA party room meeting will take place on Friday morning to vote on a leadership spill.",

    "text": "With over a decade in the political ring \u2014 and having survived several controversies in parliament \u2014 Angus Taylor is ready for his next round: challenging Sussan Ley for Liberal leadership.\n\nTaylor ended weeks of speculation on Wednesday night when he tendered his resignation to Ley, stating he no longer had faith in the party leader.\n\n\"I'm running to be the leader of the Liberal Party because I believe that Australia is worth fighting for,\" the NSW MP said when announcing the move that triggered a wave of resignations from his backers.\n\n\"I believe we need strong and decisive leadership that gives Australians clarity, courage and confidence in providing a vision for the future.\"\n\nREAD MORE Angus Taylor steps down ahead of expected Liberal leadership spill\n\nFactional ally and prominent Opposition frontbencher James Paterson has publicly backed Taylor as Liberal leader, saying it was a \"change or die\" moment for the party.\n\n\"Angus is the smartest policy brain in the shadow cabinet, a man of courage and values,\" he told reporters on Thursday.\n\nHowever, some episodes of Taylor's career \u2014 from 'Watergate' to the viral \"good job\" faux pas \u2014 continue to haunt him, and are unlikely to remain outside the spotlight as he launches his bid for the Liberals' top job.\n\nWho is Angus Taylor?\n\nThe 59-year-old grew up in southern NSW to a fourth-generation farmer, going on to study law and economics.\n\nLike former Liberal leaders Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, Taylor earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, focusing on economic philosophy.\n\nThe father of four later started up several businesses in irrigation and agriculture alongside his family \u2014 ventures which would later plague him.\n\nTony Abbott (left) and Angus Taylor (right) were both recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\nDuring his time as a consultant for McKinsey & Co, he played a key role as a go-between for New Zealand dairy farmers, leading to the launch of Fonterra, the country's largest dairy exporter.\n\nHis grandfather, William Hudson, is regarded as the father of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme.\n\nWhen he was elected in the NSW seat of Hume in 2013, he was touted as a future prime minister, due to his \"Kennedy-like\" looks, education, business links, as well as agricultural background.\n\nWatergate and 'well done Angus': Life in politics\n\nConsidered a conservative, Taylor became aligned with Tony Abbott and Peter Dutton early in his political career.\n\nHe was appointed to the energy and emission reduction portfolio under Scott Morrison, a move that raised eyebrows given his presence at anti-wind farm rallies.\n\nAs part of Ley's shadow cabinet, he was defence spokesperson, having also served as shadow treasurer under Peter Dutton.\n\nConservative Angus Taylor has spoken at several anti-wind farm rallies. Source: YouTube / Stop These Things / Crispin Trist\n\nTaylor came under criticism in 2019 after revelations that the federal government spent $80 million on water rights in 2017 from Eastern Australia Agriculture, a company where he was previously co-founder and director.\n\nThe Hume MP denied knowing about the sale or that his family benefited from the transaction, but the high price tag came under scrutiny. It was referred to as 'Watergate', with then-Twitter users placing water drops on their profiles.\n\nThat same year, Taylor was embroiled in 'grassgate' after it was found that he had met with officials to discuss illegal land clearing on a property partly owned by his family trust.\n\nTaylor was later accused of using allegedly forged documents to criticise Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore in 2019 over her council's travel costs, later issuing an apology to Moore.\n\nDuring the 2019 election, Taylor \u2014 energy minister at the time \u2014 was caught replying to his own Facebook post, praising himself for a job \"well done\" after announcing an extra 1,000 car spots at a train station in his electorate.\n\nFast forward to 2026, and as Taylor announced his leadership candidacy, Australians were quick to flood his comments section with the viral remark: \"Fantastic. Great move. Well done, Angus.\"\n\nFormerly shadow treasurer under Peter Dutton, Taylor narrowly lost the leadership spill against Ley last May. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\nTaylor's economic credentials were brought into question during the 2025 election campaign when he opposed Labor's income tax cuts, traditionally a Liberal issue.\n\nFollowing the May election defeat, Ley initially beat Taylor in a leadership contest 29 to 25, but three of her supporters have since left the party room.\n\nAs of late afternoon Thursday, nine other Liberal Party members \u2014 including Michaelia Cash and Dan Tehan \u2014 have joined Taylor and tendered their resignations.\n\n\u2014 with additional reporting from Australian Associated Press.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

I'm running to be the leader of the Liberal Party because I believe that Australia is worth fighting for. I believe we need strong and decisive leadership that gives Australians clarity, courage and confidence in providing a vision for the future. We must start by holding this failing Labor government to account for their total mismanagement of our country and advocate for solutions to the problems that Australians are facing.\"\n\nMs Ley posted a photo of herself smiling on social media, with a statement vowing to \"take the pressure off families, fix the budget, and keep Australia safe\".\n\n---\n\nAnthony Albanese says he is \"not contemplating failure\" on Closing the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nSet to give his annual Close the Gap speech today, Mr Albanese will also hand down his annual report card on progress under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap.\n\nThe latest data shows just four out of 19 targets are on track to be met by 2031.\n\nThe Minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, says there is a lot of work to be done.\n\n\"We're certainly determined to Close the Gap. We've got five more years as part of the national agreement that was signed under Ken Wyatt. We know there's incredible challenges, especially in the justice space and also the out of home care with the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, but we are determined to keep working with the states and territories to ensure we do close the gap, but also with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.\"\n\n---\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong has appointed a special envoy over the methanol poisoning of two Australian teenagers in Laos .\n\nA lack of transparency from overseas authorities prompted the appointment of seasoned diplomat Pablo Kang, who has been asked explore all avenues to progress the 2024 case.\n\nThe families of Holly Morton-Bowles and Bianca Jones were outraged this week after revelations that 10 people connected to the poisonings faced court in January and were fined just $185 for destroying evidence.\n\nNo charges were laid.\n\nMs Wong has announced Mr Kang's appointment in a statement, after the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade apologised for not providing more information to the victims' families.\n\n---\n\nThe Triple Zero phone call made by 13-year-old Austin Appelbee to get help for his family who were swept out to sea has been released by Western Australia police.\n\nThe teenager swam four hours to shore last month after he, his mother and two sisters - aged 12 and 8 years old - had drifted out to sea south of Perth on paddleboards and a kayak.\n\nThe family were rescued after an estimated 10 hours at sea, after Austin then ran two kilometres from the shore to find his mother's phone so he could make the emergency call.\n\nIn the now-released audio of the call, he calmly tells an operator that his family likely need a helicopter and says he may need an ambulance for hypothermia.\n\n\"Hello, my name is Austin and I'm outside Quindalup beach. I have two siblings: Beau and Grace. We went out on a kayak trip and we got lost out there. We couldn't get back to shore and Mum told me to go back to get help. I think we need a helicopter to go find them. I'm sitting on the beach right now and I think I need an ambulance because I think I have hypothermia.\"\n\n---\n\nTo sport,\n\nAustralians Scotty James and Valentino Guseli have both secured places in the Men\u2019s Snowboard Halfpipe finals at Milano Cortina Games.\n\nThe top-ranked qualifier for the finals, James scored 94.00 in his opening run in the pipe; delivering a switch backside double cork 1440, which he performed for the first time in a competition Switzerland last month.\n\nFellow Australian, Valentino Guseli has also secured a spot in the finals, delivering two strong and consistent runs to comfortably qualify in sixth place.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nKey points MUSIC: Remarkably, Geese live up to the hype at their Thornbury gig\n\nTHEATRE: Cluedo at the Comedy Theatre is a zany mystery with a dose of nostalgia\n\nMUSIC\n\nGeese \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe Croxton, February 12 An hour and a half before buzzy New York four-piece Geese are due on stage, there\u2019s two lines of people on the footpath outside: one waiting to get in, the other sheepishly holding up signs for tickets: \u201cFriend didn\u2019t show up? I\u2019ll buy your ticket,\u201d reads one. Another: \u201cThis Goose has no tix\u201d. Frontman Cameron Winter performs with Geese at The Croxton on Thursday, February 12. Martin Philbey Gooses they were. Ever since 23-year-old frontman Cameron Winter\u2019s wonky, astonishing solo LP Heavy Metal grew from late-2024 curiosity into revered modern classic, the cult of Cameron has turbocharged Geese\u2019s trajectory. When Winter\u2019s Tuesday night solo piano show at The Forum went on sale in August 2025, it sold out instantly. In September, Geese released their third LP, the knotty Getting Killed, to rapturous reception. It means here now, on their debut Australian tour for Laneway Festival, both Winter and Geese could have played at venues three times the size, many times over. For one night only in High Street in Thornbury, it feels like being at the molten centre of the music universe. Shockingly, Geese live up to the hype. Augmented by keyboard player Sam Revaz, Geese demonstrate they\u2019re far more than their famous frontman\u2019s backing band, with a dissonant clinic of sizzling indie rock, laced with prog, blues, punk, folk and anything else ever made with guitars. Somehow, nothing\u2019s ornamental, no one slacks off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the opening slow burn of Husbands, the rammed crowd yell every word of Winter\u2019s knack for self-flagellation: \u201cI\u2019m falling apart\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve been hit by the bus of life\u201d, \u201cBaby, you can change and still choose me\u201d. They blast through all of Getting Killed and a couple of songs from 3D Country (2023), including an unhinged 2122, inspiring the first circle pit of the night. Geese are the most exciting new band, and a damn marvel to see. Martin Philbey There\u2019s a wild vibrancy to Geese live that just isn\u2019t present on the airtight audio of their records. New chordal passages emerge as guitarist Emily Green and drummer Max Bassin lead odd, telekinetic choices \u2013 where Winter was his own wry agent of chaos at Tuesday\u2019s intimate solo show, tonight he\u2019s the steely, charismatic fulcrum around which Geese expands and contracts. Cobra, Au Pays du Cocaine and Taxes are gorgeous, given a spectral heft in this quasi-religious setting, while 100 Horses and the set-closing barnstormers, Long Island City Here I Come and Trinidad put the crowd on spin cycle. The rumours are true: Geese are the most exciting new band, and a damn marvel to see. You\u2019re a goose if you missed it.\n\nReviewed by Marcus Teague\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHEATRE\n\nCluedo \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nComedy Theatre, until March 15 Every generation from the Boomers down knows Cluedo. Editions of the game have been around since 1949, and kids tend to learn what a murder mystery is by playing it \u2013 well before they\u2019re introduced to Agatha Christie. The usual suspects ham it up in Cluedo. Eddie Jim Childhood nostalgia for the franchise undergirds this commercial comedy. It adapts Jonathan Lynn\u2019s 1985 film Clue (a box office flop that developed a cult following) and a talented cast embraces the zaniness of a show that\u2019s feather-light on suspense and plot but slathered with mildly diverting drollery. Six usual suspects are invited to an English country house under the assumed names of characters from the game \u2013 Professor Plum (David James), Miss Scarlett (Olivia Deeble), Mrs Peacock (Genevieve Lemon), Colonel Mustard (Adam Murphy), Mrs White (Rachael Beck) and Reverend Green (Laurence Boxhall).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019re greeted by the butler Wadsworth (Grant Piro), French maid Yvette (Lib Campbell) and a dour knife-wielding Cook (Octavia Barron-Martin). When their elusive host Mr Boddy (Joshua Monaghan) appears, it\u2019s only for long enough to reveal sinister designs before adding to the body count. What follows is a chaotic hunt for the killer(s) that gets serially interrupted by yet more potential victims, and features a blend of ridiculous sight gags, exaggerated caricature, inane banter and comforting in-jokes, and tightly choreographed physical humour with strong elements of revolving-door farce. Cluedo is cosy, well-turned commercial entertainment. Eddie Jim Each actor confects moments in the spotlight. They all have fun playing with genre stereotype, though it\u2019s Piro\u2019s butler who acts as a kind of MC and gives the most versatile (and ludicrous) performance, with Boxhall\u2019s neurotic, jelly-limbed slapstick not far behind. Production values are high, the set and costume design on par with the style of murder mystery theatre \u2013 think The Mousetrap \u2013 that Cluedo merrily lampoons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Melbourne live reviews Tradition and modernity collide in this story of loneliness I\u2019d like to see a push towards more diverse casting in shows of this ilk. The play\u2019s nominal setting in 1940s England hardly calls for historical accuracy or naturalism when it\u2019s based on a game played by everyone, and the familiarity Cluedo trades on might have even broader appeal if it better reflected contemporary Australian audiences. That said, Cluedo isn\u2019t envelope-pushing stuff. Nor is it \u201ca killer night out\u201d as billboards claim. No, it\u2019s undemanding comedy \u2013 a cosy, well-turned commercial entertainment that doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.

Credit: AP\n\nHe would be permitted to wear the tribute helmet after he finished his runs and when facing the media afterwards and in practice. But the IOC and his sport\u2019s governing body drew a line in the snow on him wearing it in competition.\n\nThe Ukrainian would not bend. In a sport that involves hurtling downhill at 130 km/h head-first, Heraskevych, as per Margaret Thatcher, was not for turning. He would exercise his right to be a one-man memorial.",

    "text": "Qualifying: fire in the belly In Olympic moguls, there is a field of 30 athletes, and two initial stages of qualifying. In the first, the top 10 go through to the finals, held the next day. The rest have to go again, and in that second run, the bottom 10 of the remaining 20 are eliminated. Woods came 15th on his first attempt with a score of 73.67. His family\u2019s reaction was disappointment; not in him, but how the judges assessed his performance, though he later revealed he not only shared their view, but that it motivated him. So the next day, after a check-in with his sports psychiatrist, he came out breathing fire, putting down a vastly-improved 80.46 - the best score by any competitor in the second round of qualifiers, and the second-best from the entire field to that point.\n\n\u201cI was a bit pissed off at the judges from the day before,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI was pretty fired up. I was going out there with vengeance. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m leaving nothing on the table. You guys can\u2019t score me low.\u2019 \u201cI was in the gate with my coach, and there were probably a couple of explicit words just before we dropped in to get [me] really fired up.\u201d Suddenly, confidence was flowing. Final one: pressure makes diamonds But Woods knew he had to up the ante to mix it with the medal contenders.\n\nThere are two jumps in moguls, each positioned between all the bumpy snow; in his qualifiers, he performed a back full and an off-axis 720 grab, but he felt that wasn\u2019t going to be enough for the finals. Not only did he plan to go faster, but he wanted to add an extra degree of difficulty to his top jump. \u201cOriginally heading into the first final, we were going to go back to the qualification two run, because we scored so well. Then we had a couple of opportunities in finals training, and I just wasn\u2019t missing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Let\u2019s go all in. We\u2019re at the Olympics. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat meant adding an extra 360-degree spin to the back full, turning it into what\u2019s called a back double full. In the first final, only eight of the 20 skiers progress for a shot at the podium. From being middle of the road on Wednesday, Woods scored a stunning 83.60 - the best of the round, meaning he would be last to jump in the decisive run. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually realise that I was the top qualifier of that round. It was only until I started putting my skis on that my coach told me,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I kind of freaked out a little bit.\u201d Final two: all on the line\n\nWith his Olympic dreams on the line, Woods was locked in. The plan was simple: rinse and repeat. \u201cI kept reminding myself that it is a pleasure to drop last,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never dropped last in my career, and I was dropping last behind some serious heavy hitters. I just need to relax up there, got a good coach, he kept me dialled in. I was pretty bloody nervous \u2026 [but] I knew what I had to do.\u201d While he was waiting for his turn, for the first time - and only because he was feeling so good about himself - Woods allowed his coach to let him in on what the seven other competitors were doing, and how they were scoring. He even saw some of it for himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a game plan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have so many awesome staff that are videoing and analysing other people \u2026 They were pretty straight up on what I needed to do and I needed to trust them and believe in that. I heard there was another 83 that got scored when I was up top and I was like, \u2018Oh my goodness.\u2019 It\u2019s a big mountain to get a score like that \u2026 the coach that I had up top, he was like, \u2018Stay disciplined. Do the same thing.\u2019 \u201cIt worked out.\u201d The score to beat for gold was 83.71, from Canadian veteran Mikael Kingsbury, widely considered one of the greatest moguls skiers of all time, who went just before him, the seventh of the eight still in contention. This was his final Olympics, and after winning gold in 2018 and silver in 2022 in this event, he was aiming to finish as champion again. And it looked like he might have done enough \u2026 until Woods dropped in.\n\nHe produced the same score, 83.71. In those situations, the tiebreaker is the turns score, or how the panel of judges assesses how they handled skiing on the moguls, and how smoothly and straight they moved. That was the difference. Woods\u2019 turn score was 48.4, while Kingsbury\u2019s was 47.7 \u2013 so he won gold, upsetting one of the sport\u2019s true GOATs in the most high-pressure way imaginable, with the last run of an Olympic final. \u201cHe kind of ticked all the boxes,\u201d said teammate Jackson Harvey. \u201cHe jumped really well, execution on the jumps was close to perfect and his skiing was very composed.\u201d\n\nLoading What got him over the line was his precision and attention to detail. \u201cJust the overall cleanliness of it,\u201d said teammate Matt Graham, who lifted Woods in the air when the final scores were revealed. \u201cHe connected the dots, it was seamless. Landed the top air really well and just skied out, didn\u2019t make a mistake \u2026 whereas Mick made a little mistake in the middle, and then I think they were both pretty similar in time.\u201d The Winter Olympic Games is broadcast on the 9Network, 9Now and Stan Sport.",
