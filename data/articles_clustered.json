    "text": "Exclusive: Only one in three Australian workers know if their employer has an artificial intelligence use policy, let alone what it entails, according to a nine.com.au reader poll.\ufeff\n\nThat could cause major problems, including possible termination, for workers who are found to have used AI in a way that \ufeffbreaches their employer's AI use policy.\n\n\"Consequences will generally follow the same logic as any other workplace policy breach,\" Giuseppe Carabetta, an associate professor of workplace and business law at the University of Technology Sydney, told nine.com.au.\n\nAussie workers could be risking termination by using AI without knowing their employer's policy. (Nine/Getty)\n\n\"The Fair Work tribunal has upheld dismissals where employees breach data handling, privacy, social media, and information security policies.\"\ufeff\n\nOf the poll respondents who are currently employed, close to 20 per cent admitted they use AI at work at least daily.\n\nOf these people, nearly half admitted they rely on it multiple times a day.\n\nA futher 19 per cent said they use AI weekly, while more than 60 per cent said they never use AI on the job.\ufeff\n\nOf those who do use AI at work, the majority said they only use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other \ufeffAI tools for minor tasks like writing emails and checking spelling.\n\nNearly one in three use AI to produce work like reports and presentations.\n\nAbout 10 per cent use it for other tasks like translating, researching, writing feedback, producing artwork and \"finding answers to questions asked by customers\".\n\nA little over 10 per cent admitted their employer is unaware of their AI use at work and 15 per cent are unsure if their boss knows they use AI.\n\nMore concerningly, only 32 per cent of Aussies who use AI at work actually know if their employer has an AI use policy and what it entails\ufeff.\n\n\"Even without a policy, an employer could still discipline an employee if AI use caused a privacy breach, disclosure of confidential information, reputational damage, or unsafe or discriminatory outcome,\" Carabetta said.\n\nIf there's no AI policy, workers \ufeffcan protect themselves in a few ways: never put confidential information into public AI tools; only \ufeffuse employer\u2011approved or 'secure' AI systems; and follow any other existing employer policies.\n\nIf in doubt, workers can also ask \ufeffan authorised manager what AI use is permitted.\n\n\"If the worker knew the rules and ignored them, then even a first offence may justify termination,\" Carabetta said.\n\n\"Especially where confidentiality or client trust is undermined.\"\n\nThe nine.com.au poll, which runs once a fortnight, canvases the views of the Nine audience on 9Nation, which is an online community of our readers and viewers.\n\nHave you got a story?

Heraskevych's helmet\n\nUkranian skeleton athlete Heraskevych wore a helmet depicting athletes killed in the Russia-Ukraine war. (Getty Images: Andrew Milligan/PA Images)\n\nAt the 2022 Games in Beijing, days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych held up a sign that read \"No War in Ukraine\".\n\nFour years later, Heraskevych began his campaign in Italy wearing a helmet depicting some of the Ukrainian athletes killed since then.\n\nReuters reported that some of the athletes included on the helmet were \"weightlifter Alina Perehudova, boxer Pavlo Ishchenko, ice hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, actor and athlete Ivan Kononenko, diving athlete and coach Mykyta Kozubenko, shooter Oleksiy Habarov and dancer Daria Kurdel.\"\n\nHeraskevych told Reuters the Olympic Committee had contacted the Ukrainian team about the helmet, with the Olympic Charter outlawing any \"kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda\".\n\n\"It's still being processed,\" he said to the agency.\n\n2. 'Really special' haka for silver medallist\n\nZoi Sadowski-Synnott's supporters performed a haka for her after her big air silver. (Reuters: Hannah Mckay)\n\nZoi Sadowski-Synnott just missed out on adding gold to her snowboard big air bronze and silvers from 2018 and 2022, settling for another silver behind Japan's Kokomo Murase.\n\nThe Sydney-born New Zealand rider, who won gold in slopestyle in 2022, celebrated her silver medal and received an extra honour from the whole team on the mountain.\n\n\"I didn't know that was happening,\" she said.\n\n\"I just went and saw my family, and then turned around, and the whole team was performing a haka for me, and it was really special. It meant a lot to me.\n\n\"I feel very honoured to have carried the New Zealand flag in the Opening Ceremony and to represent my country, New Zealand, Aotearoa.\n\n\"My whole family's out there. All of my teammates' families are out here. It's really special to have the support from everyone and to share this experience and enjoy the Olympics and the spirit.\"\n\n3. Bradbury's dig at Jake Paul\n\nPaul was overcome with joy as fiancee Leerdam claimed speed skating gold with an Olympic record. (Getty Images)\n\nWith more than 5 million followers on Instagram, Jutta Leerdam is a legitimate speed skating superstar.\n\nAnd she was electric on day three in Italy, claiming gold in the women's 1,000 metres with an Olympic record time of 1:12.31.\n\nBut outside of winter sport circles, she is also renowned as the fiancee of YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, who was in attendance as Leerdam broke new ground in Milan.\n\nAnd Paul was overcome with emotion as Leerdam flew towards glory, cheering and sobbing in a video he posted to Instagram, the caption reading \"MY BABY JUST SET THE OLYMPIC RECORD.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nThe couple is well known for supporting each other's sporting endeavours \u2014 but, on commentary for Channel Nine, Australian Winter Olympic great Steven Bradbury was in no doubt about who was the more talented of the pair.\n\n\"I reckon she's a better skater than he is a boxer,\" Bradbury said.\n\n4. Skeleton power couple go head-to-head\n\nSilveira (left) and Meylemans make up the power couple of world skeleton. (Getty Images: Robert Michael/picture alliance)\n\nRanked first and ninth in the world, Belgium's Kim Meylemans and Brazil's Nicole Silveira are two of the world's finest skeleton athletes.\n\nThey also happen to be married.\n\nOn day three, the couple went head-to-head in the official training for the event, with Meylemans finishing in eighth and claiming spousal bragging rights.\n\nThe pair were already together when they competed at Beijing 2022, but this is their first Games as a married couple, having tied the knot in 2025.\n\nIn an Instagram post celebrating their wedding, Meylemans wrote that competing together in Italy, where same-sex marriage was not allowed, would be a golden opportunity to \"shine a light on marriage equality\".\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n5. Sharing is caring\n\nBefore today, there had been a total of 30 \"shared\" medals in the history of the Winter Olympics.\n\nBy the end of it, that number had risen to 32.\n\nIn the men's team alpine skiing, the Austrian pair of Vincent Kriechmayr and Manuel Feller combined for a time of 2:45:03, exactly the same figure as Swiss duo Marco Odermatt and Lo\u00efc Meillard.\n\nThat meant that, after 170 gates and 4,000 metres, both teams received silver medals, with the bronze not being awarded.\n\nThe second step on the podium got quite crowded. (Getty Images: Image Photo Agency)\n\nAnd only a matter of hours after that, lightning had struck twice, with Japan's Ren Nikaido and Switzerland's Gregor Deschwanden both finishing with 266 points in the men's normal hill ski jumping to share the third step of the podium.\n\nBefore today, the last shared medals came in 2018, with Canada and Germany uniting for two-man bobsleigh gold and Norway's Marit Bj\u00f8rgen and Finland's Krista P\u00e4rm\u00e4koski sharing bronze in the women's cross country skiing.",

(AAP via Photosport: Iain McGregor)\n\nThe river was a controversial choice of venue when it was announced last year, with Premier David Crisafulli declaring Brisbane 2032 would be \"a Queensland Games for all of Queensland\".\n\nHowever, World Rowing and the International Canoe Federation (ICF) are yet to sign off on the venue due to the waterway not meeting the technical specifications for international competition.\n\nAs Queensland Parliament resumes, Mr Mander and member for Rockhampton Donna Kirkland said they would provide an update during sittings on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fitzroy River rowing course has been the subject of independent and international testing. (Supplied: Rockhampton Fitzroy Rowing Club)\n\nMs Kirkland said speculation that Olympic officials were looking to shift rowing and canoeing events away from the city was \"nonsense\".\n\n\"Rockhampton will proudly host Olympic and Paralympic rowing on the Fitzroy River as outlined in the 2032 Delivery Plan,\" Ms Kirkland said.\n\n\" We are getting on with the job of delivering a remarkable event that showcases our region to the world and leaves a lasting legacy for growth. \"\n\nDavid Crisafulli has reassured the public that Rockhampton will host Olympic rowing. (Supplied: Rockhampton Grammar School)\n\nGames for the regions\n\nIn October the Rockhampton venue passed initial testing by the state's Games Independent Infrastructure and Coordination Authority (GICCA).\n\nBut in a signed joint statement supplied to the ABC, World Rowing president Jean-Christophe Rolland and ICF president Thomas Konietzko said the groups were not ready to give the go-ahead for the Fitzroy and were committed to ensuring \"fair and safe competition\".\n\nPremier David Crisafulli has previously said funding would be pumped into regional areas to help support legacy venues for the 2032 Olympics.\n\n\"It had been recommended to move the [rowing] event to Sydney, but I believe there is a legacy play and we must grab that,\" he said.\n\nMembers of Australian men's rowing four team train during a training session at the Tokyo Olympics. (AP: Lee Jin-man)\n\nThe site has been used as a staging camp for major events for the Australian rowing team, including before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIn February, World Rowing and ICF officials toured Rockhampton with members of the 2032 Organising Committee while the river was in flood.\n\nDeputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie said rowing officials walked away impressed with the region's potential.\n\nHe reiterated the state government would not change its position on hosting events in Rockhampton and other regional venues.",

    "text": "Jason McCarthur remembers the first time he received an email with a request to purchase one of his Broken Hill tote bags.\n\nIt was late 2024, and the email seemed odd.\n\nFor one, the sender appeared to be overseas and, secondly, McCarthur received another almost identical email about half an hour later.\n\nHe presumed it was a scam, until more enquiries arrived in his inbox about the tote bags.\n\nSoon, he had sold out of the bags so he ordered 100 more. A day later, those too had all sold out and he had 30 pre-orders for more.\n\nBut it did not stop there.\n\nJason McCarthur sells his artwork on magnets and tote bags. (ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nUnbeknownst to McCarthur, Japanese pop star Fujii Kaze had been spotted in a documentary with one of the Broken Hill artist's designs on a tote bag.\n\nSuddenly thousands of Kaze's fans turned their attention to the outback artist living 7,000 kilometres away.\n\nMcCarthur's brush with fame led to him having an exhibition in Tokyo earlier this year.\n\nIt started with a tote bag\n\nJ-pop singer/songwriter Fujii Kaze had been in McCarthur's home town of Broken Hill filming a music video for his song Hana, which was released in November 2023 and has more than 71 million views on YouTube.\n\nDuring production the multi-award-winning artist's production team ventured into the city to collect supplies and souvenirs, stopping in at McCarthur's shop on Argent Street.\n\n\"They came in and I had a bit of a chat with one of the fellas, but you wouldn't have thought they were any different to anyone else,\" said McCarthur, who sells souvenirs, crystals and artworks.\n\nAmong the team's purchases was a tote bag with one of McCarthur's cityscapes on it.\n\nFujii Kaze's production team purchased a Broken Hill tote from Jason McCarthur. (ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nMonths later Kaze was spotted with the tote bag in a documentary.\n\nThe documentary was only released in Japan so McCarthur was completely unaware of it when he started receiving messages from eager fans wanting the same tote.\n\n\"It was so random, and I thought it was spam \u2026 I thought someone had taken the mickey out of me,\" he said.\n\n\"I said to my wife, 'What do we do?' Like, I didn't know what the hell was going on.\n\n\"We were driving the post ladies batty.\"\n\nMcCarthur believes he has sold more than 15,000 bags since then.\n\nOpportunity comes knocking\n\nThe demand for the totes led McCarthur to make contact with a reseller in Japan, one of the first people who initially reached out to purchase the bag, a woman named Hiroko Yasutomi.\n\nThe pair became fast friends and got talking about future plans.\n\n\"I said to Hiroko that I had always dreamt of having an exhibition overseas, and she said she'd look into it.\"\n\nTo McCarthur's shock, Ms Hiroko delivered on her promise and she found a gallery cafe in Shibuya, central Tokyo, that was interested in showing his work.\n\nJason McCarthur with his family and friends at his exhibition in Tokyo. (Supplied: Jason McCarthur)\n\n\"We had to fund everything ourselves, [but] we took the risk on,\" McCarthur said.\n\n\"Up until this point it was never something on our mind to go to Japan.\"\n\nJason McCarthur was overwhelmed by the hospitality he received in Japan. (Supplied: Jason McCarthur)\n\nIn early January, McCarthur and his wife Amy, along with their two daughters, travelled to Japan to make his dream a reality.\n\n\"I had one lady cry after having a photo with me and she said, 'I'm OK, but I'm overwhelmed from meeting you', and I thought, 'I'm Jason McCarthur from Broken Hill, I'm no celebrity.'\"\n\nThe artist said he was now planning to set up a website for his business where he could sell his art online.\n\nOpen door policy\n\nMcCarthur's souvenir shop on Broken Hill's main drag is more than a store; it's also where he paints.\n\nWith a full-time business and two teenage daughters, it is often the only place he can get his artwork done.\n\n\"It might take a few days [to complete a painting] depending on how busy the shop is,\" he said.\n\nWith a busy home life, Jason McCarthur often paints at work when he has the time. (ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\nMuch of his art is inspired by the outback.\n\n\"I love painting colour and painting stories; if I see something that I like I'll have a go at it. Anything from football to flowers to the landscape, I'll have a go.\"\n\nArt has also provided him with an outlet when times get tough with his mental health.\n\nWellbeing is something McCarthur takes very seriously and it has led to him having an \"open door\" policy for anyone who needs a chat.\n\nJason McCarthur says his door is open for anyone who needs a chat. (ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)\n\n\"[Sometimes] you're smashing your head against a brick wall, every turn seems to be another hurdle to cross and you find that you're not winning, but when you don't have people around you it's harder to see that rainbow at the end of the tunnel,\" he said.\n\n\"I tell people that if this door is open, then I'm happy to talk to them.\"",

So we are working on it.\"\n\nWomen's downhill gold medallist Breezy Johnson was one of the first to unintentionally test the medals to breaking point.\n\nShe was jumping for joy when the medal came detached from the ribbon around her neck.\n\nBreezy Johnson's medal came unstuck from its ribbon during her zealous celebration.

In the men's team combined Alpine skiing event at the 2026 Winter Olympics, the Swiss and Austrian teams tied for silver. So what happens to the bronze medal? And when there was a tie for bronze in the men's ski jumping, was there a spare bronze?\n\n\"It came apart. I'm sure somebody will fix it. It's not crazy broken, but it's a little broken.\"\n\nTV footage broadcast in Germany captured the moment biathlete Justus Strelow realised his mixed relay bronze had fallen off the ribbon around his neck and clattered to the floor as he danced along to a song with teammates.\n\n\"Hey Olympics, what's up with those medals?\" the German biathlon team posted on Instagram.\n\n\"Are they not meant to be celebrated?\"\n\nJustus Strelow's German biathlon teammates laughed as his bronze medal snapped off its ribbon. (Instagram: dsv_biathlon)\n\nHis German teammates cheered and laughed as Strelow tried without success to reattach the medal before realising the smaller piece had broken off and was still on the floor.\n\nUS figure skater Alysa Liu posted a clip on social media of her team event gold medal, detached from its official ribbon.\n\n\"My medal don't need the ribbon,\" Liu wrote.\n\nWomen's 10km + 10km skiathlon silver medallist Ebba Andersson also had the same thing happen as she was running across the snow with teammate and gold medallist Frida Karlsson after their medal ceremony.\n\n\"That did not go completely according to plan. It's in two pieces, with one of our coaches, right now,\" she said.\n\n\"One of the three pieces that made up the medal fell off. After a lot of faffing about, we let that piece be. It was a small pin that secured the medal in its pendant.\n\n\"I don't know if the medal is made to hang around your neck when you're running across half of the home straight, and also doing it at the speed of Frida Karlsson. I was a bit stupid trying to follow her.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the quality of Olympic medals has come under scrutiny.\n\nFollowing the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, some medals had to be replaced after athletes complained they were starting to tarnish or corrode, giving them a mottled look likened to crocodile skin.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

They stuck with the design in 2025 and have again kept the winning design for the 2026 season.\n\nThe McLaren MCL40 will have a similar livery design to the 2024 and 2025 challengers, when McLaren won the F1 constructors' championships.

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nNorris is the first McLaren driver to race with the number one since Jenson Button in 2010, who drove for McLaren after winning the 2009 drivers' championship with Brawn GP.\n\nWith a new season dawning, Norris said he enters the 2026 campaign filled with anticipation and excitement as the reigning champion.\n\n\"To win the Championship with the team I've been with since the beginning was incredible. We're coming into this year as World Champions, and I'm excited to see what we can achieve in this new era of Formula 1,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"I'm ready for this year, and I can't wait to get back on track and keep pushing forward.\"\n\nThe first of two preseason testing sessions will be held in Bahrain from February 11 to 14.\n\nThe F1 season begins with the Australian Grand Prix weekend in Melbourne from March 6 to 8.",

Credit: Justin McManus Roberts comes from the construction industry, where he has worked for over 30 years with construction consulting firm WT Partnership. A club director since 2022, Roberts was involved in Essendon\u2019s VFL program and establishing their AFLW team at the Bombers\u2019 spiritual home at Windy Hill, as well as being across their commercial operations, community programs and football department strategy. Sporting organisations do not usually hire a CEO from their board, though Cricket Australia took this step in 2018 when they appointed then-director Kevin Roberts to replace the long-serving James Sutherland. Essendon said Tim Roberts\u2019 understanding of the club, coupled with his business acumen, led to him being identified as a candidate during the process, and he was encouraged to apply.\n\n\u201cTim has successfully built global businesses across a range of industries, and we are excited he can bring that experience and commercial acumen to his new role as CEO,\u201d president Andrew Welsh said. \u201cTim has been an outstanding contributor to the club since joining in 2022, and his elevation to vice president last year was a reflection of the value he was already adding to the Bombers. \u201cWe have seen Tim\u2019s impact firsthand in his time on the board, and he was clearly the best candidate for what Essendon needs, someone who can strengthen our culture, provide continuity and allow us to execute our club strategy. Roberts, who starts on Monday, is the Bombers\u2019 fourth CEO in three years, following on from Vozzo, Andrew Thorburn and Xavier Campbell. Thorburn resigned after one day in the job.\n\n\u201cThe platform for success has been created by those who have gone before me, and I am proud to take on this challenge and continue Craig Vozzo\u2019s incredible contribution,\u201d Roberts said. Loading \u201cThe Essendon I grew up barracking for were league leaders on and off the field, proud of the red and black and seen as a fierce, courageous, confident and bold club. That\u2019s my vision for this club, and along with Welshy, our board and leadership, we are determined to reclaim that space. \u201cEssendon is a club that should be consistently competing for finals and premierships, be embracing and impactful in our community and commercially sustainable. \u201cDuring my business career I learned that people are the cornerstone of your success, and footy clubs are no different. We have terrific talent across our club through the executive, coaches, staff and playing groups, and our focus is to get the best out of everyone, being galvanised and executing our club strategy.\u201d\n\nViney succumbs to Achilles Michael Gleeson Jack Viney will have surgery on his Achilles injury on Tuesday and is set to miss at least three months, costing him most of the first half of the AFL season if his recovery goes well. The Demons will be without Jack Viney\u2019s ball-winning abilities in round one. Credit: Getty Images As recently as late last week, Melbourne fitness staff were hopeful that Viney would avoid surgery and be available for the early rounds of the season.\n\nThat decision changed on Monday, with the 31-year-old leader booked for surgery.

Melbourne will hope All Australian small forward Kysaiah Pickett can move into the midfield to join Max Gawn Credit: Getty Images When in January the midfielder attempted to lift his training to the next level, his Achilles flared again while his back also caused problems. His lengthy absence means the Demons\u2019 midfield, which was already to be re-cast after the trading out of Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver in the off-season, and the trading in of former Saints captain Jack Steele, will now be almost unrecognisable from the midfield set-up that has carried the club for most of the last decade.\n\nOnly captain Max Gawn will remain of the regular midfield quartet that will take on the Saints at the MCG in round one on March 15. Gawn is playing for Victoria in the State of Origin match against WA on Saturday night. New Melbourne coach Steven King knew he was taking on the job with a different list to manage, but that is even more apparent now, without four players from the top 10 in the club\u2019s best and fairest last year \u2013 Petracca was second, Oliver seventh and Viney 10th. Jake Bowey, who finished fourth, had surgery to repair a lisfranc injury in his foot in December, a procedure that was expected to sideline him for at least six months. The importance of the trading in of Steele from St Kilda has grown in significance to help keep experience around the ball for the Demons. The absences are expected to deliver more opportunities for promising young players Harvey Langford, Caleb Windsor and Xavier Lindsay.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThrough my education and coaching work, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with a really diverse range of people, some who are financially struggling, but many who are already financially comfortable, from doctors and lawyers to senior professionals and business owners. Despite having a good income, many of them carry a nagging feeling of financial uncertainty and stress. They know they \u201cshould\u201d be doing well, but somehow they can\u2019t seem to get ahead. A six-figure salary won\u2019t mean much if your fundamentals are still broken. Simon Letch Contrary to popular opinion, earning a high income won\u2019t create financial success (many high-income earners live pay to pay), unless you know how to convert money into wealth. Today, I\u2019m sharing some of the challenges that hold high-income earners back from creating the level of financial success that their income makes possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inertia that comes with comfort It is not unusual for me to see clients who are financially struggling create bigger and more rapid changes in their financial life than some who are financially comfortable. When I started working in this space, this surprised me. I knew that with a few small changes, people could make a $50,000 and even $100,000 impact to their financial future. It seemed bizarre to me that someone who was in a position to make these changes with ease would be less inclined to do so than those who were struggling to get by. When you arrive at a place where you\u2019re financially comfortable, you unlock the opportunity to grow. But there is an urgency that comes with struggle and pain that is a powerful driver of action. This is a key missing ingredient for so many people who are financially comfortable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey do not have a strong enough drive to take action. They see their finances as just another administrative chore that they keep telling themselves they\u2019ll get around to some time in the future. How do you overcome this inertia? When you no longer have pain and struggle driving your action, you have to switch gears and learn how to be motivated by desire. You have dreams you\u2019ve probably talked yourself out of: Buying a dream home; Quitting your job to go travelling for a year; Retiring early; Sending your kids to private school. What if those dreams weren\u2019t impossible? What if you could get there with a lot less work than you think? When you arrive at a place where you\u2019re financially comfortable, you unlock the opportunity to grow not because you have to, but because you want to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy would you want to keep growing when you don\u2019t have to any more? Because the goal of life isn\u2019t just comfort, it\u2019s aliveness. Comfort is nice. But that feeling of exhilaration you get when you create a version of your life that you barely thought was possible? That\u2019s priceless. Trying to pay away the problem Editor's pick Opinion\n\nActive investing Novice to pro: How to go from $0 to $100K in investments Paridhi Jain Money contributor When you have money, it\u2019s easier to just pay someone to figure it out for you. Dropping a few thousand dollars on a financial planner, buyer\u2019s agent or investment adviser is not a huge deal. But working with financial professionals is not a substitute for developing your own financial capability. Unlike outsourcing other tasks \u2013 housekeeping, lawn-mowing, meal-prepping etc \u2013 there is a lot more on the line when you\u2019re outsourcing your finances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdeally, you should always be in the driver\u2019s seat of your own financial life. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t engage professionals \u2013 it just means their role should be to advise you, not to call the shots for you. The stronger your foundational understanding of your own finances, the more you can actively participate in the decision-making process. This will not only produce better outcomes long-term, but also significantly reduces the risks of engaging financial professionals. This is another way in which I find that people with less disposable income can end up better off long-term. They don\u2019t have the luxury of dropping $5000 to $10,000 to outsource their financial decisions, so they have to find the time to figure things out the hard way: by themselves. In the process they build their financial capability and confidence, which becomes a lifelong asset. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve seen high-income earners sink tens of thousands of dollars bouncing from one financial professional to another, hoping that \u201cthis one will work out\u201d. In short, just because you can afford to outsource your financial decisions doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ready to, or that that\u2019s the optimal place for you to start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt pays (literally) to learn how to do some of the basics yourself first, so you are better equipped to handle a relationship with a professional long-term. It\u2019s not hard, but it does take a bit of time and a bit of work. Earning a high income only gives you the potential for financial success. Whether you can actualise that potential depends on how well you can convert those earnings (money) into assets (wealth) through saving and investing.

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe long-running fight against development at Smiths Beach in Yallingup has been dealt a huge blow after the Environmental Protection Authority recommended the project be approved. The EPA made public its recommendations to Environment Minister Matthew Swinbourne on Tuesday, five years after the Adrian Fini-led developer Smiths 2014 Pty Ltd first lodged the 42-hectare Smiths Beach Project proposal. The latest renders for the Smiths Beach development in WA\u2019s South West. The project, valued at $280 million in 2022, includes a hotel, wellness centre, 61 holiday homes, campground, community hub and surf lifesaving club. The recommendation comes six days after Swinbourne approved Saracen Properties\u2019 121-room five-star Westin resort and residential village in Gnarabup, south of the Smiths Beach site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its press release, the EPA took the step of noting that \u201cseveral members\u201d of the EPA, including chair Darren Walsh declared a conflict of interest regarding the Smiths Beach proposal and were not \u201cinvolved in any related discussions and/or decisions.\u201d Walsh has a lengthy history working in the development sector, including at Satterley Property Group, and at JBS&G, the environmental consultancy that Fini used to prepare its application to the EPA. The EPA said board members Jane Bennett, David Caddy and Hamish Beck also recused themselves from Smiths Beach discussions. Locals have been fighting development at the site for more than two decades under the Save Smiths Beach Action Group banner, citing concerns about the level of clearing, fire risk, sewage impacts and the use of the controversial State Development Assessment Unit to gain planning approval. The proposal has also attracted criticism from the opposition and features in an ongoing opposition-led parliamentary inquiry into Labor Government planning procedures. Save Smiths Beach Action Group convenor David Mitchell said the EPA had ignored its own rulings in a 2009 proposal the suggested the western half of the development site on the headland should not be developed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a very happy group of Western suburbs businessmen today. There\u2019s probably a long lunch being had in Subiaco,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Mornings Program. \u201cThey have basically regurgitated the developer\u2019s own proposal, and the EPA has capitulated. \u201cIt\u2019s universal that all the government agencies are against development on the headland on both visual and environmental grounds.\u201d The EPA made its recommendation subject to conditions around wastewater management, clearing and offsets of fauna habitat. Those offsets, proposed by Fini\u2019s company, included rehabilitation of western ringtail possum and black cockatoo foraging habitat at three sites within the state government\u2019s estate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Property development Perth developer denies trying to \u2018bypass\u2019 planning process in bid to expand prime beach project Other conditions include requiring the developer to manage weeds at the site and 50 metres outside the development envelope, including on Crown land. \u201cMaintaining habitat connectivity between vegetation in the development envelope and the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park is front and centre of the EPA\u2019s conditions,\u201d an EPA spokeswoman said. \u201cOther measures in the proponent\u2019s conservation significant Fauna Management Plan and Offset Strategy address feral animal control, nearby offset areas, and a community-based revegetation program. \u201cAnd conditions relating to secondary foraging and dispersal habitat for the western ringtail possum contain a requirement for a conservation covenant. This includes establishment costs and long-term management and maintenance costs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Smiths Beach Project spokeswoman welcomed the EPA\u2019s decision and said the company would adhere to the conditions. \u201cOur project team of leading Australian landscape designers and architects have designed the coastal village, including its hotel and community facilities, in a way that is sensitive to the site\u2019s environmental and cultural significance,\u201d she said.

Tourism WA \u201cThis brings us closer to realising our project vision of creating a world-class seaside village for the benefit of Western Australia and the South-West - enabling the local community and visitors to this state to share and enjoy the best aspects of our lifestyle and environment.\u201d Fini was behind the Bunker Bay Resort, built south of Smiths Beach in 2004, and has been pursuing a development at the Smiths Beach site after purchasing it alongside several other families in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe previous owner\u2019s proposal attracted the first iteration of the Save Smiths Beach community protest campaign, with locals claiming a win after the developer went on to become embroiled in a Corruption and Crime Commission investigation, along with several local councillors. The structure plan approved under the old owners\u2019 proposal featured up to 500 tourism and residential dwellings, with the western side of the lot to be handed to the state government as a national park. Fini\u2019s new proposal features a broader footprint but less density, which Fini in the past has said improved amenity and greater retention of vegetation. Last year, Fini\u2019s company removed a planned ramp to Smiths Beach over community concerns it would act like a \u201csea wall\u201d. The EPA\u2019s recommendation will be open for a three-week public appeal period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVasse MP Libby Mettam said the EPA\u2019s approval was disappointing, also pointing to the 2009 EPA decision, which recommended the western headland section not be built on.

    "text": "The rise of antibiotic resistance is threatening millions of lives worldwide, but \"unconventional\" Australian research could make obsolete medications effective again.\n\nData released by the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that some of the most common illnesses in the world are becoming more resistant to treatment every year.\n\nDr Maud Eijkenboom says the current approach of developing new antibiotics is losing the battle to ever-evolving viruses and bacteria.\n\nAfter her son struggled with an antibiotic-resistant disease, Eijkenboom set out on her own path to discover a better way to quell the rising wave of lethal pathogens.\n\nLISTEN TO Australian researchers on a mission to save millions of lives from antibiotic resistance SBS News 14:06 English\n\nIn 2021, she founded Lixa, a Perth-based biotech company that has received international support for its \"game-changing\" research.\n\nA decade of debilitation\n\nEijkenboom says her son Jonathan Barker once couldn't lead a normal life.\n\nHe was 12 years old when he started to faint regularly, and would fall asleep without being able to be roused \u2014 often for hours at a time.\n\n\"He virtually was a hundred per cent in bed,\" Eijkenboom tells SBS News.\n\n\"We had to carry him to the bathroom for two years, and then it took a total of six years to come back from it.\"\n\nBarker had multiple infections stemming from Lyme disease, which he developed after being bitten by a tick in Europe. The disease is typically transmitted to humans by ticks carrying a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. Scientists have not found the bacterium in ticks in Australia.\n\n\"It had become chronic, and it was pretty nasty, and it was very difficult to get to the bacteria [for analysis],\" she says.\n\n\"My husband and I are both drug developers, and we looked around in frustration because we couldn't help our son.\"\n\nThat frustration propelled Eijkenboom and her husband to do their own research. They felt the medical world was too focused on developing new drugs and was not asking what could be done about antibiotics that were no longer working.\n\n\"Because we couldn't help Jonathan for a long time, we did a lot of research,\" Eijkenboom says.\n\nAfter studying and working with university researchers, she raised capital and founded Lixa, aiming to find a solution to antibiotic resistance \u2014 for her son and others.\n\n\"You look around, and resistance and chronic conditions are everywhere,\" she says.\n\n\"You see elderly women with urinary tract infections, you see children with glue ear [a build-up of sticky fluid in the middle ear that can cause temporary hearing loss], there must be something in common across all bacteria that we need to be able to get to.\"\n\nRise of antimicrobial resistance\n\nAntimicrobials are drugs such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitics that target and kill germs \u2014 or pathogens. These are microorganisms that cause disease and include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.\n\nThe WHO has found that pathogens are developing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), making them harder to treat and causing patients to suffer through symptoms for longer.\n\nBased on data from the National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey, 50 per cent of Australian hospital patients will receive an antimicrobial, such as broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nThese are used to treat common infections, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea, and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), which causes a range of skin infections as well as serious infections like pneumonia and sepsis.\n\nSource: SBS News\n\nAssociate professor Rietie Venter, the head of microbiology at the University of South Australia, tells SBS News that AMR poses \"significant treatment challenges\".\n\n\"Pathogens can start showing signs of resistance to a new medication very fast, within a few years even,\" Venter says.\n\n\"Lower and middle-income countries often struggle with limited access to newer or last-line antibiotics, exacerbating the impact of resistant infections.\"\n\nVenter explains that AMR is more than just a problem for wound care.\n\n\"The agriculture industry in the US, for instance, has a big problem with resistance, driven by the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production,\" she says.\n\nResistant bacteria can spread from farms into soil and water through animal waste, contaminating the food supply and surrounding environments, she explains.\n\nAMR is even on the rise in households due to cross-contamination via washing machines and kitchen counters, which can harbour detergent-resistant germs.\n\n\"Supporting research and development of new antibiotics or alternative antimicrobial therapies is vital in combating the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance,\" she says.\n\nAn 'unconventional' new approach\n\nEijkenboom says her company's mission is to solve the antimicrobial resistance \"crisis\", not by creating new antibiotics, but by targeting the composition of deadly pathogens.\n\n\"We do that by breaking resistance. And we've got universal resistance breakers that tame bacteria,\" she explains.\n\n\"They go from a resistant state to a sensitive state, and suddenly the oldest antibiotics \u2014 or biocides or surfactants or whatever detergents you want to use \u2014 can work again as they used to.\"\n\nThe innovative approach neutralises pathogens and stops them from developing resistance to treatment. Pathogens typically develop resistance through genetic mutations, which are then passed on via rapid reproduction.\n\nSome antimicrobials directly damage or disrupt the cell membrane, which is basically the bacteria\u2019s skin.\n\nWhen that happens, the cell leaks its contents and dies. But breaking it also triggers its survival instincts, allowing resistance to develop. So Eijkenboom\u2019s approach is to avoid breaking the membrane.\n\n\"If you break the membrane of a bacterium, you create an evolutionary pressure, which will cause more resistance. So by not breaking it, you can bring back antibiotics again.\"\n\nREAD MORE The key to a long life? One factor may matter more than we thought\n\nLixa's technology has completed a phase one clinical trial using a nebuliser (a type of medical inhaler) to test its effectiveness in treating chronic respiratory infections.\n\nShe says it was found to be \"very safe\" for the lungs, one of the body's most sensitive organs.\n\nThe company is now looking to test an oral form, such as a tablet.\n\nLixa announced a partnership with the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership (GARDP) on 2 February to scale the technology to market-readiness.\n\nThe GARDP is a not-for-profit global health organisation based in Switzerland that analysed Lixa's clinical data for 10 months before agreeing to support the company.\n\n\"Lixa's compounds represent an unconventional new approach to AMR treatment and after a review of their preclinical data, our experts thought that it is worth supporting Lixa to generate additional data to pressure-test their approach,\" Fran\u00e7ois Franceschi, an associate director at GARDP, said in a statement.\n\n\"If their technology is found to be safe and effective in clinical trials, this could represent a game-changer in the way we treat drug-resistant bacterial infections.\"\n\nThe innovation gap\n\nJames Graham, the CEO of Recce Pharmaceuticals, says \"next-generation novel approaches are urgently needed to stay ahead of this crisis\".\n\nHe tells SBS News there is an \"innovation gap\" where a lack of funding and resources means new medicines are hard to research and develop.\n\n\"Most antibiotic classes we rely on today were discovered between the 1940s and 1980s, and no new class has been approved in over 40 years,\" he says.\n\nRecce Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company headquartered in Sydney, is developing a new product designed to combat AMR: synthetic anti-infectives.\n\nGraham says that while this kind of innovation is very much needed, the process of researching, trialling and taking a new treatment to market in Australia is long and expensive.\n\n\"We've spent nearly $100 million getting this new class of antibiotics into a late-stage phase three trial,\" he says.\n\n\"And we're not done yet.\"\n\nClinical trials typically consist of three phases, says Graham, covering discovery through to testing in labs and, finally, in people.\n\n\"The final piece of that is at the end of phase three, you obviously then submit for market application, which can take many months to about a year.\"\n\nGraham says more financial investment is needed in companies looking for solutions to AMR, but he believes Australia is \"really well placed\" to support new innovation.\n\nHe describes the federal government's research and development tax incentive scheme as an \"incredibly compelling\" program, which can enable companies to offset R&D expenditure up to $150 million. Those with an annual turnover of less than $20 million can offset costs equal to their corporate tax rate, plus a premium of 18.5 per cent. The premium is lower for companies with higher turnover.\n\n\"That's incredibly unique anywhere in the world. So if you're in the United States, you're lucky to get 2 to 5 per cent [of expenditure offset],\" he says.\n\n'Create a life now'\n\nEijkenboom says her son, who is now 22, can leave the house again.\n\n\"It took 10 years for him to recover; he didn't have any schooling, no high school, because he was asleep,\" she says.\n\n\"When we count the impact of AMR, we count the people who die, but we don't count the people who are debilitated, who can't take part in a normal life.\"\n\nShe says her son is \"much better now\" and found his first job a few months ago.\n\n\"He doesn't want to look back on his illness. And he just wants to go ahead and create his life now.\"\n\nEijkenboom is looking to the future too. She believes Lixa\u2019s work, although in its early stages, could make a unique contribution to the fight against AMR.\n\n\"I think we're onto something and that we're really kicking some big goals, and it's quite interesting to do that from little Perth, whereas the rest of the world is still stuck in developing antibiotics.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Sporting organisations do not usually hire a CEO from their board, though Cricket Australia took this step in 2018 when they appointed then-director Kevin Roberts to replace the long-serving James Sutherland. Essendon said Tim Roberts\u2019 understanding of the club, coupled with his business acumen, led to him being identified as a candidate during the process, and he was encouraged to apply.\n\n\u201cTim has successfully built global businesses across a range of industries, and we are excited he can bring that experience and commercial acumen to his new role as CEO,\u201d president Andrew Welsh said. \u201cTim has been an outstanding contributor to the club since joining in 2022, and his elevation to vice president last year was a reflection of the value he was already adding to the Bombers. \u201cWe have seen Tim\u2019s impact firsthand in his time on the board, and he was clearly the best candidate for what Essendon needs, someone who can strengthen our culture, provide continuity and allow us to execute our club strategy. Roberts, who starts on Monday, is the Bombers\u2019 fourth CEO in three years, following on from Vozzo, Andrew Thorburn and Xavier Campbell. Thorburn resigned after one day in the job.\n\n\u201cThe platform for success has been created by those who have gone before me, and I am proud to take on this challenge and continue Craig Vozzo\u2019s incredible contribution,\u201d Roberts said.

That\u2019s my vision for this club, and along with Welshy, our board and leadership, we are determined to reclaim that space. \u201cEssendon is a club that should be consistently competing for finals and premierships, be embracing and impactful in our community and commercially sustainable. \u201cDuring my business career I learned that people are the cornerstone of your success, and footy clubs are no different.

The Demons will be without Jack Viney\u2019s ball-winning abilities in round one. Credit: Getty Images As recently as late last week, Melbourne fitness staff were hopeful that Viney would avoid surgery and be available for the early rounds of the season.\n\nThat decision changed on Monday, with the 31-year-old leader booked for surgery.

Melbourne will hope All Australian small forward Kysaiah Pickett can move into the midfield to join Max Gawn Credit: Getty Images When in January the midfielder attempted to lift his training to the next level, his Achilles flared again while his back also caused problems. His lengthy absence means the Demons\u2019 midfield, which was already to be re-cast after the trading out of Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver in the off-season, and the trading in of former Saints captain Jack Steele, will now be almost unrecognisable from the midfield set-up that has carried the club for most of the last decade.\n\nOnly captain Max Gawn will remain of the regular midfield quartet that will take on the Saints at the MCG in round one on March 15. Gawn is playing for Victoria in the State of Origin match against WA on Saturday night. New Melbourne coach Steven King knew he was taking on the job with a different list to manage, but that is even more apparent now, without four players from the top 10 in the club\u2019s best and fairest last year \u2013 Petracca was second, Oliver seventh and Viney 10th. Jake Bowey, who finished fourth, had surgery to repair a lisfranc injury in his foot in December, a procedure that was expected to sideline him for at least six months. The importance of the trading in of Steele from St Kilda has grown in significance to help keep experience around the ball for the Demons. The absences are expected to deliver more opportunities for promising young players Harvey Langford, Caleb Windsor and Xavier Lindsay.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThrough my education and coaching work, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with a really diverse range of people, some who are financially struggling, but many who are already financially comfortable, from doctors and lawyers to senior professionals and business owners. Despite having a good income, many of them carry a nagging feeling of financial uncertainty and stress. They know they \u201cshould\u201d be doing well, but somehow they can\u2019t seem to get ahead. A six-figure salary won\u2019t mean much if your fundamentals are still broken. Simon Letch Contrary to popular opinion, earning a high income won\u2019t create financial success (many high-income earners live pay to pay), unless you know how to convert money into wealth. Today, I\u2019m sharing some of the challenges that hold high-income earners back from creating the level of financial success that their income makes possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inertia that comes with comfort It is not unusual for me to see clients who are financially struggling create bigger and more rapid changes in their financial life than some who are financially comfortable. When I started working in this space, this surprised me. I knew that with a few small changes, people could make a $50,000 and even $100,000 impact to their financial future. It seemed bizarre to me that someone who was in a position to make these changes with ease would be less inclined to do so than those who were struggling to get by. When you arrive at a place where you\u2019re financially comfortable, you unlock the opportunity to grow. But there is an urgency that comes with struggle and pain that is a powerful driver of action. This is a key missing ingredient for so many people who are financially comfortable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey do not have a strong enough drive to take action. They see their finances as just another administrative chore that they keep telling themselves they\u2019ll get around to some time in the future. How do you overcome this inertia? When you no longer have pain and struggle driving your action, you have to switch gears and learn how to be motivated by desire. You have dreams you\u2019ve probably talked yourself out of: Buying a dream home; Quitting your job to go travelling for a year; Retiring early; Sending your kids to private school. What if those dreams weren\u2019t impossible? What if you could get there with a lot less work than you think? When you arrive at a place where you\u2019re financially comfortable, you unlock the opportunity to grow not because you have to, but because you want to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy would you want to keep growing when you don\u2019t have to any more? Because the goal of life isn\u2019t just comfort, it\u2019s aliveness. Comfort is nice. But that feeling of exhilaration you get when you create a version of your life that you barely thought was possible? That\u2019s priceless. Trying to pay away the problem Editor's pick Opinion\n\nActive investing Novice to pro: How to go from $0 to $100K in investments Paridhi Jain Money contributor When you have money, it\u2019s easier to just pay someone to figure it out for you. Dropping a few thousand dollars on a financial planner, buyer\u2019s agent or investment adviser is not a huge deal. But working with financial professionals is not a substitute for developing your own financial capability. Unlike outsourcing other tasks \u2013 housekeeping, lawn-mowing, meal-prepping etc \u2013 there is a lot more on the line when you\u2019re outsourcing your finances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdeally, you should always be in the driver\u2019s seat of your own financial life. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t engage professionals \u2013 it just means their role should be to advise you, not to call the shots for you. The stronger your foundational understanding of your own finances, the more you can actively participate in the decision-making process. This will not only produce better outcomes long-term, but also significantly reduces the risks of engaging financial professionals. This is another way in which I find that people with less disposable income can end up better off long-term. They don\u2019t have the luxury of dropping $5000 to $10,000 to outsource their financial decisions, so they have to find the time to figure things out the hard way: by themselves. In the process they build their financial capability and confidence, which becomes a lifelong asset. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve seen high-income earners sink tens of thousands of dollars bouncing from one financial professional to another, hoping that \u201cthis one will work out\u201d. In short, just because you can afford to outsource your financial decisions doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ready to, or that that\u2019s the optimal place for you to start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt pays (literally) to learn how to do some of the basics yourself first, so you are better equipped to handle a relationship with a professional long-term. It\u2019s not hard, but it does take a bit of time and a bit of work. Earning a high income only gives you the potential for financial success. Whether you can actualise that potential depends on how well you can convert those earnings (money) into assets (wealth) through saving and investing.

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe long-running fight against development at Smiths Beach in Yallingup has been dealt a huge blow after the Environmental Protection Authority recommended the project be approved. The EPA made public its recommendations to Environment Minister Matthew Swinbourne on Tuesday, five years after the Adrian Fini-led developer Smiths 2014 Pty Ltd first lodged the 42-hectare Smiths Beach Project proposal. The latest renders for the Smiths Beach development in WA\u2019s South West. The project, valued at $280 million in 2022, includes a hotel, wellness centre, 61 holiday homes, campground, community hub and surf lifesaving club. The recommendation comes six days after Swinbourne approved Saracen Properties\u2019 121-room five-star Westin resort and residential village in Gnarabup, south of the Smiths Beach site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its press release, the EPA took the step of noting that \u201cseveral members\u201d of the EPA, including chair Darren Walsh declared a conflict of interest regarding the Smiths Beach proposal and were not \u201cinvolved in any related discussions and/or decisions.\u201d Walsh has a lengthy history working in the development sector, including at Satterley Property Group, and at JBS&G, the environmental consultancy that Fini used to prepare its application to the EPA. Locals have been fighting development at the site for more than two decades under the Save Smiths Beach Action Group banner, citing concerns about the level of clearing, fire risk, sewage impacts and the use of the controversial State Development Assessment Unit to gain planning approval. The proposal has also attracted criticism from the opposition and features in an ongoing opposition-led parliamentary inquiry into Labor Government planning procedures. Save Smiths Beach Action Group convenor David Mitchell said the EPA had ignored its own rulings in a 2009 proposal the suggested the western half of the development site on the headland should not be developed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Property development Perth developer denies trying to \u2018bypass\u2019 planning process in bid to expand prime beach project \u201cThere\u2019ll be a very happy group of Western suburbs businessmen today. There\u2019s probably a long lunch being had in Subiaco,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Mornings Program. \u201cThey have basically regurgitated the developer\u2019s own proposal, and the EPA has capitulated. \u201cIt\u2019s universal that all the government agencies are against development on the headland on both visual and environmental grounds.\u201d The EPA made its recommendation subject to conditions around wastewater management, clearing and offsets of fauna habitat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose offsets, proposed by Fini\u2019s company, included rehabilitation of western ringtail possum and black cockatoo foraging habitat at three sites within the state government\u2019s estate. Other conditions include requiring the developer to manage weeds at the site and 50 metres outside the development envelope, including on Crown land. \u201cMaintaining habitat connectivity between vegetation in the development envelope and the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park is front and centre of the EPA\u2019s conditions,\u201d an EPA spokeswoman said. \u201cOther measures in the proponent\u2019s conservation significant Fauna Management Plan and Offset Strategy address feral animal control, nearby offset areas, and a community-based revegetation program. \u201cAnd conditions relating to secondary foraging and dispersal habitat for the western ringtail possum contain a requirement for a conservation covenant. This includes establishment costs and long-term management and maintenance costs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Smiths Beach Project spokeswoman welcomed the EPA\u2019s decision and said the company would adhere to the conditions. \u201cOur project team of leading Australian landscape designers and architects have designed the coastal village, including its hotel and community facilities, in a way that is sensitive to the site\u2019s environmental and cultural significance,\u201d she said.

Tourism WA \u201cThis brings us closer to realising our project vision of creating a world-class seaside village for the benefit of Western Australia and the South-West - enabling the local community and visitors to this state to share and enjoy the best aspects of our lifestyle and environment.\u201d Fini was behind the Bunker Bay Resort, built south of Smiths Beach in 2004, and has been pursuing a development at the Smiths Beach site after purchasing it alongside several other families in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe previous owner\u2019s proposal attracted the first iteration of the Save Smiths Beach community protest campaign, with locals claiming a win after the developer went on to become embroiled in a Corruption and Crime Commission investigation, along with several local councillors. The structure plan approved under the old owners\u2019 proposal featured up to 500 tourism and residential dwellings, with the western side of the lot to be handed to the state government as a national park. Fini\u2019s new proposal features a broader footprint but less density, which Fini in the past has said improved amenity and greater retention of vegetation. Last year, Fini\u2019s company removed a planned ramp to Smiths Beach over community concerns it would act like a \u201csea wall\u201d. The EPA\u2019s recommendation will be open for a three-week public appeal period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVasse MP Libby Mettam said the EPA\u2019s approval was disappointing, also pointing to the 2009 EPA decision, which recommended the western headland section not be built on.

(Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nThe government and the media found out about the restrictions around the same time, he said under questioning from Nationals senator Matt Canavan.\n\nAgriculture Minister Julie Collins and Trade Minister Don Farrell have since been in contact with Chinese officials, with the most recent letter sent on Monday.\n\n\"The government has been quite forward-leaning in saying that they're very disappointed with this decision,\" Mr Campbell told the hearing.\n\nThe US remained Australia's biggest market for red meat, with 10 per cent tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump removed in late 2025.\n\nBeef exports to the US were worth $5.2 billion each year and the demand for sheep meat was also strong, exports and veterinary services first assistant secretary Tom Black said.\n\nCattle prices are down after producers in flood and fire-affected regions sold off stock. (Dan Peled/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"Demand into the US market is incredibly high,\" Mr Black said.\n\n\"The US herd is at historical lows and they're seeking to take product from not only Australia, but other markets as well.\"\n\nLocal cattle prices had started to wane as producers in flood and fire-affected regions sold off stock, Bendigo Bank's monthly market update said.\n\nBut beef export volumes reached a record high at 20 per cent above the five-year average for January.\n\n\"While most demand is coming from the US and China, China's new import quota on Australian beef may start to impact this in 2026,\" the update said.",
