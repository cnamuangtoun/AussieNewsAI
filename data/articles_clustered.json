    "text": "Caleb Ewan's retirement from the professional peloton, with immediate effect, has taken the majority of the sport by surprise.\n\nAged just 30, the pocket rocket from Sydney looked to have rediscovered himself at an Ineos Grenadiers team that itself was undergoing something of a metamorphosis in 2025.\n\nTwo bunch sprints. Two wins.\n\nA career reborn?\n\nSadly not, another \"what if\" in a career that has, unfortunately, been dogged by them.\n\nEwan has \u2014 despite managing to resurrect a career that looked to be petering out last season \u2014 stuck with a performers golden rule of leaving them wanting more.\n\nHowever, most importantly, there was a sentence in the midst of his unfailingly honest and open retirement statement that hit home more than any other and shows that if the heart is not in it, there's little point in continuing.\n\n\"What once felt like everything to me no longer does,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The truth is that even when I crossed the line first, that feeling \u2014 the one you chase for years \u2014 faded quicker than it used to.\"\n\nIn the furious and frantic world of high-level sprinting, if the heart is not there, then the immeasurable risks are certainly not worth it.\n\nCaleb Ewan's extraordinary, unique forward sprinting style earned him 65 career victories. (Getty Images: Corbis/Tim De Waele)\n\nThe timing of this announcement will surprise plenty.\n\nEwan has never been one to conform though.\n\nWhen he burst onto the scene as a precocious youngster at the 2015 Herald Sun Tour and the 2016 Tour Down Under, there was nothing orthodox about his sprinting style.\n\nCrouched impossibly low over his handlebars, leaning so far forward it looked almost as if he was dragging his bike along behind him, Ewan seemingly popped his way out of the chaos of the charging peloton like a cork from the champagne that would invariably flow soon after he crossed the line.\n\nHis 65 career victories tell part of his story. The way he won them says the rest.\n\nBouncing behind and through opposition sprint trains, weaving Mark Cavendish-like into minuscule gaps before dropping the power to surge home, Ewan often had to fend for himself, a 165cm will-o'-the-wisp appearing at the front of the pack at the key moment.\n\nEwan used his diminutive size to superb effect, standing as one of the giants of sprinting.\n\nEwan Caleb's (centre) low sprinting style was unique in the professional peloton. (Getty Images: Kei Tsuji)\n\nContemporaries Andr\u00e9 Greipel (183cm), Fabio Jakobsen (181cm), Sam Bennett (178cm), Elia Viviani (177cm), Dylan Groenewegen (177cm) Jasper Phillipsen (176cm) and Mark Cavendish (175cm) all towered over the Sydneysider \u2014 not that it mattered when they were on the steps below him on the podium.\n\n\"For as long as I can remember, my world has revolved around racing,\" Ewan wrote in his retirement statement.\n\n\"The intense routine, the sacrifice, the search for constant improvement, the hunger to win \u2014 it's been my rhythm, my identity.\n\n\"The last few years haven't been easy but in 2025 I found something again \u2014 not just legs, but belief \u2014 thanks to the Ineos Grenadiers. They gave me space, trust, and the environment to rediscover what I am capable of.\n\n\"I won again. I felt like myself again and I felt respected again. For that, I can't thank them enough.\"\n\nCaleb Ewan returned to winning ways in his first race of the year at the 40th Settimana Internazionale Coppi e Bartali. (Getty Images: Dario Belingheri)\n\nWinning as a sprinter is everything.\n\nAnd winning was something Ewan was good at.\n\nHe is, after all, one of just 111 riders in the history of the sport who has claimed victory in each of cycling's three grand tours in the 90 years the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a have all co-existed, with five victories at the Tour de France, five at the Giro and one at the Vuelta.\n\nHe is one of just five, alongside Simon Gerrans, Michael Matthews, Rohan Dennis and, last year, Ben O'Connor, to have done so from Australia.\n\nCaleb Ewan earned his first Tour de France stage win in Toulouse by an inch from Dylan Groenewegen. (Getty Images: Chris Graythen)\n\nAnd yet there have always been disappointments too.\n\nTwice Ewan came agonisingly close to winning the sprinters monument, Milano-Sanremo, finishing behind Jasper Stuyven in 2021 and, in 2018, winning the bunch sprint behind Vincenco Nibali's bold solo win.\n\nEarlier in his career, despite his impressive form in the sprints in minor races, it took a move to Lotto Soudal in 2019 before he was given his first crack at the Tour de France.\n\nHis inclusion was instantly vindicated, winning three stages having also won two at that year's Giro \u2014 the first sign of many \"what ifs\" that may come to define his career.\n\nEwan competed at every Tour between then and 2023, but won his last stage at cycling's most high profile race in 2020. His last grand tour win came the following year at the Giro d'Italia, although he did manage two second place finishes at the Giro and Tour in subsequent seasons.\n\nOne of Ewan's five Tour de France wins came on the historic Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. (Getty Images: Justin Setterfield)\n\nThose diminishing returns led to a total breakdown in trust between himself and the Belgian team, prompting a move back to GreenEdge.\n\nThere, things went from bad to worse.\n\nAt the 2024 Giro, where Ewan finished no higher than sixth in bunch sprints, GreenEdge allowed German rider Max Walscheid \u2014 Ewan's lead-out man following Luka Mezgec's withdrawal \u2014 to sprint against him.\n\nIt was described as \"bonkers\" by Ineos rider Geraint Thomas, as \"a pretty shitty situation\" by Ewan himself.\n\n\"My experiences of the past two seasons, in particular the second half of 2024, has taken a significant toll on my relationship with the sport,\" Ewan said in his statement.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"I'm happy I didn't let that period define the end of my career and I am proud of what I achieved in a short but successful time with the Ineos Grenadiers.\"\n\nWhat he did achieve, those two wins against a questionable standard of opposition at the Itzulia Basque Country and the Settimana Internazionale Coppi e Bartali, offered a glimpse at a revival.\n\nBut, instead, we're left with another what if \u2014 albeit from the entirely understandable position of not wanting to go on if his heart is not in it.\n\nCycling commentator Matthew Keenan told ABC Sport in Adelaide earlier this year that he \"would hate for him [Ewan] to finish his career thinking that he's left anything on the table\".\n\nWhether he did leave any major wins on the table will be one of the great unknowns.\n\nBut given that from his perspective the cupboard was well and truly bare, one cannot fault his choice.",

    "text": "More claims of threats towards opposition players have emerged against Port Adelaide's Willie Rioli, with three different clubs now involved.\n\nThe claims range from threats made on the field to at least one made via a message off the field.\n\nHere's everything you need to know in a quickly unfolding story.\n\nWhat sparked the claims and what did Willie Rioli say?\n\nThe Western Bulldogs claimed Rioli sent a message to one of their players, indirectly threatening violence against Bailey Dale following an altercation on the field on the weekend.\n\nThe claim suggested that Rioli had told Dale's teammate that the defender should be careful during the club's visit to Darwin this weekend to play the Gold Coast Suns \u2014 which was an indirect threat to Dale's safety.\n\nWhile Rioli was fined $1,000 for the on-field physical altercation with Dale, the AFL deemed there was no case to answer for the off-field threat as Rioli had apologised to Dale.\n\n\"The AFL has today spoken to both Port Adelaide and the Western Bulldogs and while confirming it will take no further action to that undertaken by the clubs and players, it has reminded both clubs to ensure any communications remain respectful,\" a statement read.\n\nWhat are the claims that have come out since?\n\nAfter the AFL announced it would not take action against Rioli, two further claims emerged of the forward making \"pretty violent\" threats against players from Geelong and Essendon during the 2024 season.\n\nFootage has emerged of Rioli engaged in an aggressive push and shove with Cats players in their round nine match at Kardinia Park, after Rioli gave away a 100m penalty to Cats defender Zach Guthrie.\n\nRioli is then seen arguing with Zach's brother, Cameron, before a short clip shows him speaking aggressively towards Cats forward Brad Close.\n\nClose is believed to have been the target of what has been described as a \"horrific\" personal threat.\n\nAn angry Jeremy Cameron is then seen confronting Rioli after the alleged comment.\n\nClaims have been made that Laura Kane knew about the Geelong incident, but the AFL has denied it. (Getty Images: AFL Photos/Michael Willson)\n\nAfter the match, Close and his fellow Cats players decided not to officially raise the incident with the AFL, but it was mentioned to Cats football boss Andrew Mackie.\n\nConflicting reports have since emerged about whether Mackie then communicated the incident to the AFL's football boss, Laura Kane, with The Age reporter Caroline Wilson saying that it had been raised \u2014 a claim the AFL dismissed as \"entirely false\" while the Cats said they did not approach the AFL.\n\nAfter the Geelong incident came to light, a further alleged threat towards Essendon player Archie Roberts came to light from a game in early 2024. Both Roberts and the club did not take the matter further.\n\nWhat is the AFL doing about the alleged threats?\n\nThe AFL initially decided to clear Rioli over the message to Dale, despite a flood of outrage from fans who questioned why players were being fined for incidents as small as flipping the bird at the crowd, while the Power star managed to escaped sanction.\n\nHowever, the emergence of further alleged threats has sent the AFL scrambling, with claims it was unaware of the incidents from 2024.\n\nHigh level discussions were underway on Wednesday morning to discuss the issue, with a \"distressed\" Rioli now potentially facing a significant fine or a suspension over the claims.\n\nPort Adelaide are set to face cross-town rivals Adelaide on Saturday night in what is expected to be a heated match.\n\nWhat have key figures said?\n\nPort Adelaide coach Ken Hinkley is set to face his usual press conference on Wednesday afternoon and will be pushed on the matter.\n\nClub chair David Koch said he and the board were \"incredibly angry\" with Rioli.\n\n\"We're incredibly angry about the situation and Willie knows that. And what's said on the field is one thing. What's done off the field \u2014 particularly on social media \u2014 and a private message to another player who he thought would stay private but then was passed on, it gets very complicated,\" Koch said on Adelaide radio.\n\nDavid Koch says the board is angry with Rioli, adding that comments made on the field are less problematic than those made off it. (AAP Image: Julian Smith)\n\n\"We've talked pretty sternly to Willie about it and said it's just not on.\n\n\"On field in the heat of the battle is one thing. Off-field and on social media is totally different. That's why we're really angry with Willie and what he did, and there's absolutely no excusing that, and don't get me wrong on it. But we've got a duty of care to support the players and turn a bit of attention on what society is doing to these players.\"\n\nKoch reiterated that he thought on-field comments were a different situation from off-field.\n\n\"If you're going to start examining every comment, not only against Indigenous players but other players as well, then I'm not sure where that will end up, because it happens constantly,\" he said.\n\n\"You can't just isolate a couple of comments from a particular player. Otherwise you then start to open it up \u2014 or you should start to open it up \u2014 for comments across every player, and it would be never-ending at that stage.\n\n\"You'd either have to crack down on every comment and say, 'OK there's no sledging, there's no sledging getting inside people's heads, there's no sexual references, there's no racial comments,' all that sort of thing and you just ban it altogether.\"\n\nEssendon coach Brad Scott said his club had no issues with Rioli.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"It's not an Essendon issue. Our players have zero concerns,\" Scott said on Wednesday.\n\n\"There are community expectations around player behaviour on and off the field, but within those expectations, I have a pretty firm belief of what happens on the field should stay on the field, provided that it's within general community expectations.\n\n\"Our players feel that whatever was said or done on field against Port Adelaide should stay on the field. We're not interested in engaging further.\"\n\nGeelong said in a statement that the alleged incident at Kardinia Park had be dealt with.\n\n\"In regards to a report on Tuesday night relating to an incident during the Geelong v Port Adelaide game in round nine, 2024, the club can confirm the matter was not raised with the AFL,\" a Cats statement said.\n\n\"The club spoke directly with Port Adelaide after the match and considered the matter dealt with.\"",

(ABC News: Rhiannon Shine)\n\nMurdoch University ecology lecturer Joe Fontaine said there was less broad-scale burning during autumn, which was usually busy.\n\n\"That takes a lot of work, a lot coordination \u2026 because of the hours and staffing required,\" he said.\n\n\"Right now, burning is focusing on high-risk areas closer to where people live.\"\n\nDr Fontaine said the overall fuel load was likely to mount in fire-prone areas ahead of next summer's bushfire season if the burn-off delays increased.\n\nIndustrial action is 'mild'\n\nThe Australian Workers' Union, which represents the firefighters, said the 300 workers had been seeking better conditions and wages for more than two years.\n\nAustralian Worker's Union DBCA delegates met in Bunbury.

    "text": "On election night, as Labor secured a second term, China's foreign ministry released a statement congratulating the Albanese government \u2014 time-stamped just before midnight on a national public holiday.\n\nFor a government that rarely rushes to comment on foreign elections, the timing alone was notable.\n\nThe language was even more revealing.\n\nThe statement referenced the \"important consensus\" reached between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese \u2014 a deliberate nod to personal diplomacy and Beijing's desire to \"continue promoting a more mature, stable and productive China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership\".\n\nIn the careful world of Chinese diplomatic language, it was a clear message: Beijing had been closely watching \u2014 and was keen to rebuild trust with the Australian public.\n\nXi sees Australia as a strategic partner \u2014 a relatively stable player amid the turbulence of Beijing's deteriorating relationship with the United States.\n\nHe sees the re-election of the Albanese government not just as political fact, but as strategic opportunity.\n\nThe next three years will test whether Albanese's measured approach can hold under pressure \u2014 from Beijing, from Washington, and from domestic critics.\n\nBeijing may not want to be the story.

(ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nChina didn't dominate the campaign \u2014 but the story of China lingered just beneath the surface of the debate between Albanese and his rival Peter Dutton.\n\nAnd while China said it didn't want to interfere in Australian elections, the signs of interest were unmistakable.\n\nChina's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, published two opinion pieces during the campaign \u2014 one in the Australian Financial Review, the other in The Australian \u2014 outlining Beijing's vision for the bilateral relationship.\n\nTogether it formed a careful choreography: not overt interference, but strategic visibility.\n\nNow that the election result is settled, deeper challenges will surface.\n\nChief among them is the future of the Darwin Port lease \u2014 a politically charged issue first raised under the Morrison government, and a recurring flashpoint in Australia's China debate.\n\nChinese community urges rethink on Labor, Coalition's Darwin Port plans Photo shows Shuqin Li Darwin's Chinese community is calling for federal Labor and the Coalition to reconsider plans to take back the Darwin Port lease.\n\nIn 2015, Chinese company Landbridge secured a 99-year lease on the port in a $506 million deal.\n\nSince then, it has undergone multiple national security reviews \u2014 all of which have so far upheld the lease.\n\nBut in the final weeks of the campaign, pressure mounted again. Critics argued the lease undermines sovereignty and national security.\n\nLabor, pre-empting attacks, pledged to \"reconsider\" the deal if re-elected.\n\nLandbridge has known ties to China's military through its founder's reported involvement in state-led defence logistics programs.\n\nIt was the Northern Territory's Country Liberal Party government that signed the 99-year lease with Landbridge in 2015 under the Coalition government led by Malcolm Turnbull \u2014 and any move by Labor to overturn it now would face significant legal, diplomatic and commercial hurdles.\n\nFormer Australian ambassador to China Geoff Raby sees it differently.\n\n\"My view is the whole issue is ridiculous,\" said Raby, now the chair and CEO of a Beijing-based business advisory firm.\n\nLabor pledged to \"reconsider\" the Darwin Port deal if re-elected. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\n\"It's been reviewed again and again. The Port of Darwin isn't a national security risk. This is about political opportunism \u2014 and if we keep moving the goalposts, we risk damaging Australia's credibility as an investment destination.\"\n\nRaby also warned of a broader consequence: sovereign risk.\n\nIf foreign investors \u2014 not just in China \u2014 believe that legally binding deals can be overturned for political reasons, Australia's reputation as a reliable destination could suffer.\n\nChina's silent campaign gift\n\nThen there was maritime theatre.\n\nChinese military and research vessels were observed moving along Australia's coastline in March, stirring debate in the media and defence circles.\n\nChinese warships re-enter Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and head closer to Tasmania Photo shows A black and white image of a navy ship. Three Chinese warships that completed live-fire drills in the Tasman Sea re-entered Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and were tracked operating east of Hobart.\n\nThe sighting of these vessels sparked controversy across Australia, reigniting debate over how the nation should respond to a rising China asserting its presence in the region.\n\nThe prime minister and other senior Labor figures responded calmly.\n\nAlbanese said that while he'd \"prefer\" the ship wasn't in Australian waters, he emphasised China hadn't broken international law.\n\n\"That was not just a coincidence,\" said Liu Luxin, a Chinese-Australian political commentator.\n\n\" It actually helped Labor. These moves had a positive effect for the Albanese government. \"\n\nAll seven of the marginal seats with the largest Chinese populations have turned to Labor.\n\nLoading...\n\nOnly Menzies, where Labor candidate Gabriele Ng leads, is still too close to call.\n\nLabor didn't campaign on foreign policy \u2014 but its message of stability, especially on China, with all of the chaos from the US-China trade war, resonated in key multicultural electorates.\n\n\"It reminded people that Labor has kept the relationship with China steady. People didn't want instability \u2014 they wanted continuity,\" Liu said.\n\n\"That presence might have been subtle, but it mattered more than people realised.\"\n\nStill, others argue that the link between the vessels and the election outcome is tenuous.\n\nThe government itself made no public comment connecting the two, and defence analysts stopped short of attributing political intent.\n\nWhat's clear, however, is that China remains a powerful backdrop to how many Australians think about security, stability and leadership.\n\nWhat does China want from another Albanese term?\n\nFor Beijing, a second Albanese term offers opportunity.\n\nAfter inheriting one of the lowest points in the bilateral relationship in 2022, the foreign minister re-established diplomatic contact and softened the tone.\n\nNow, with US-China tensions intensifying \u2014 and Donald Trump's re-election inflaming global uncertainty \u2014 Beijing sees Australia as a stable market and business partner, particularly as it faces steep tariffs in the US.\n\nWith both Canada and Australia returning centre-left governments this year, China may view them as useful interlocutors amid broader global economic and diplomatic fragmentation.\n\nAlbanese's big challenge is straddling the US-China fence Photo shows Donald Trump frowns as he looks off camera while Xi Jinping stands behind him. America has decided to sever its trading relationship with China \u2014 a strategy that ultimately will come at enormous cost. And Australia, more than any other nation, will be caught smack in the middle.\n\nXi also remains interested in joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\n\nBut Taiwan's inclusion in early-stage discussions has aggravated Beijing, which insists the island is a province of China.\n\nHow Albanese and Wong navigate Taiwan's role \u2014 while maintaining support for democratic norms \u2014 will be closely watched by officials in Beijing.\n\nAfter securing Australian journalist Cheng Lei's release in 2023, the Albanese government was praised for its quiet diplomacy.\n\nThe fate of Australian citizen Yang Hengjun presents a far tougher test.\n\nDetained in China since 2019, Yang was sentenced earlier this year to a suspended death penalty \u2014 a ruling that has drawn strong criticism from human rights advocates and the Australian government.\n\n\"The Albanese government raises it at every opportunity,\" said Raby.\n\n\"They are focused, and committed to pursuing it without megaphone diplomacy. And I think they will keep doing that \u2014 carefully and persistently.\"",

    "text": "Under the hum of filtered air and fluorescent light in an air-locked university lab, Jeff Warner lifts an agar plate to eye level, inspecting its potentially deadly contents.\n\nTilting the violet dish in his double-gloved hand, he notes several streaks of pink \u2014 a cross hatching of colonies; tiny microbial clusters teeming with life, invisible to the naked eye.\n\nThe distinct colours and formations are instantly recognisable to him: it's the killer bacterium linked to 30 deaths in a \"mysterious\" and unprecedented outbreak that's devastating Queensland families and putting immense pressure on regional hospitals.\n\n\"This organism has currently killed almost one in five people who have acquired it from the environment, here in Cairns and Townsville,\" Associate Professor Warner told 7.30.\n\nThe veteran microbiologist first came across the disease close to 30 years ago and is now considered a global research leader on the topic, based at James Cook University in the tropical north.\n\n\"You can toy with the words all you want,\" he says.\n\n\" But the cases up here, this wet season, are unprecedented. \"\n\nScientists at James Cook University are studying the bacteria that leads to melioidosis. (ABC News: Brendan Mounter)\n\nThe bacterium on the plate is Burkholderia pseudomallei, classified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a Category B biowarfare agent, for its high fatality rate and its potential to be aerosolised and weaponised.\n\nIn Queensland, however, the threat isn't theoretical or military. It's real and environmental \u2014 lurking in soil and muddy water, stirred up by flooding rains and inhaled, ingested, or entered into the bloodstream through cuts and scratches.\n\nFor the unlucky, it leads to melioidosis \u2014 a virulent disease that enables chronic skin ulcers, sepsis, and serious lung infections like pneumonia. If left untreated, or diagnosed too late, it can be fatal.\n\n\"It replicates [and] produces proteins that are toxins to our body, and that's fundamentally what causes the fatality,\" Professor Warner said.\n\nThe bacterium is typically confined to tropical climates where it thrives in heat and humidity, but scientists and health authorities are increasingly concerned it could be pushed further south as Australia's climate warms and our urban footprint expands.\n\n\"In the end, we don't really know why so many cases have happened,\" he said.\n\nDr Jeff Warner has been studying melioidosis for decades. (ABC News: Tom Hartley)\n\nIn the water and on the move\n\nIn Townsville, a different pattern is emerging. The city has long been considered the unofficial home of melioidosis \u2014 early cases of the disease were once clustered around Castle Hill, the city's granite monolith.\n\nDr Warner says that is no longer the case.\n\nIn recent months, new clusters have surfaced north of the city \u2014 Professor Warner believes they are not random.\n\nThe melioidosis mystery plaguing scientists Photo shows A middle-aged man wearing a grey singlet and beige cap sits in his backyard. Luke Bantoft has survived melioidosis but the experience has left him \"petrified\" of returning to his home where he believes he caught it.\n\nHe suspects the bacterium is moving, and is investigating if it is changing in the same way a flu can, becoming better adapted to the climate, the people who live in the area, or both.\n\n\"We have proven in the past that the organism is available in ground water as it goes through Castle Hill,\" Professor Warner said.\n\n\"That's now changed the actual demographic and the case notifications [have] now quite substantially changed.\n\n\"Why has it changed? Have we got any evidence that it's moving? We don't ... so the missing link in melioidosis research is ... trying to understand the environmental microbiology of the disease.\n\n\"Until we do, we're not going to be able to really develop good quality, targeted [and] informed public health messaging to actually help people understand risk.\"\n\nThe data shows melioidosis is on the move in Townsville. (ABC News: Tom Hartley)\n\nGiven its presence in groundwater, Professor Warner says that may explain how cases have spread.\n\n\"Water seems to be important in the organism's mobility,\" he explained.\n\n\"We all know that when the wet season breaks, you smell the rain.\n\n\" There are hundreds of thousands of bacteria in single water droplets \u2014 that you could potentially inhale. \"\n\nThe working theory is the bacteria is liberated by rising water tables and during extreme rainfall, then able to spread into rivers and creeks, and carried over long distances. Once settled in new terrain, it can survive \u2014 and thrive.\n\nTownsville has seen a surge in melioidosis cases this wet season. (ABC News: Brendan Mounter)\n\nIn Townsville, researchers have already matched strains of the bacterium found in local watercourses to those found in infected patients. But whether that water is the direct source of human infection is still unknown.\n\n\"That's what we are embarking upon, for the first time ever in North Queensland,\" Professor Warner says, out to solve the \"fundamental mystery\" of melioidosis.\n\n\"Where you get it from, what behaviour encourages transmission and does climate and environmental change affect disease patterns?\"\n\nProfessor Warner also believes there's merit in a theory by public health physician Dr Simon Smith, which hypothesises that an upgrade to the Bruce Highway, south of Cairns, has contributed to a sudden increase in melioidosis cases due to it disrupting the soil.\n\n\"You tend not to see this organism in the soil environment where we've got highly fertile soils,\" he said.\n\n\"That's probably because it gets out-competed by other organisms which really enjoy fertility and high nutrition.\n\n\" This organism has got the ability to survive without requiring much nutrition in the environment. \"\n\nDr Jeff Warner is leading a team of researchers to better understand the potentially deadly bacteria. (ABC News: Tom Hartley)\n\nThe public health conundrum\n\nWith a $1.5 million federal grant, Professor Warner is now leading a five-year investigation to trace the organism's movements.\n\nThe project will unite clinicians and scientists from across the north, including Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, and teams in Cairns and Townsville, with assistance from several university and phd students.\n\nThousands of environmental samples will be taken across northern Australia, while genomic and spatial data will help map exactly where the organism persists \u2014 and predict where it might emerge as the climate becomes warmer.\n\n\"There are literally squillions, zillions of microorganisms in that 10 grams of soil, and we've got to try and find the melioidosis in that zoo of bacteria,\" Professor Warner says.\n\nScientists will be extracting bacteria from thousands of soil samples over five years. (ABC News: Tom Hartley)\n\nThe ultimate goal is to move beyond broad warnings and into tailored public health messaging.\n\n\"There is essentially very limited evidence to describe where people get this disease, what behaviour encourages transmission,\" Professor Warner said.\n\nQueensland's Health Minister has been called to deliver funding to help solve the melioidosis mystery. (ABC News: Tom Hartley)\n\nProfessor Warner's optimism belies concerns the state government, and the health minister, headquartered 1,300 kilometres away, are not giving this outbreak the deserved attention, with zero dollars from the coffers on the table.\n\n\"Melioidosis is a disease that describes very well the differences between urban and rural health expectations,\" he said.\n\n\"The disease is very rare in capital city populations, but in regional northern Australia is one of the leading causes of fatal bacterial pneumonia and blood poisoning, that particularly affects the elderly and vulnerable people and their communities.\n\n\"If we're fair dinkum about Australians looking after the underprivileged, there's lots of things we can do better for regional communities, and that includes our leaders investing more.\"\n\nA Queensland Health spokesperson confirmed to 7.30 there was no extra funding in the pipeline for melioidosis research.\n\nThere are concerns more people will die from the disease if research isn't better funded. (ABC News: Tom Hartley)\n\nIn Cairns, infectious diseases expert Dr Simon Smith suggested information-sharing between district health services needs to be urgently improved.\n\n\"I think it's really key that we start working more closely with our colleagues in Townsville and Darwin \u2026 that we join together and pool our resources to try and identify why we're seeing this large increase in northern Queensland,\" Dr Smith said.\n\n\" What the concern is, if the rates stay as high as what they have been this year, or indeed, they increase, then we're just going to see a lot of people with the disease, and even with the best access to care, we still see people dying. \"\n\nWatch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV",

    "text": "With the campaign behind her \u2013 and her party reeling from a crushing national defeat \u2013 Liberal Party candidate for Kooyong Amelia Hamer has taken a swipe at her own side, including the main slogan plastered on her corflutes.\n\nThis is the most candid she\u2019s sounded all campaign \u2013 despite her own political future still hanging in the balance. Speaking with Jacqui Felgate on 3AW Drive, Hamer was asked to reflect on what went wrong for the opposition and said one theme emerged repeatedly: the campaign lacked substance.\n\n\u201cThe one piece of feedback I was hearing consistently throughout the campaign is that people wanted to see more substantial policy from us \u2013 and they wanted to see it earlier,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNot just \u2018hey nuclear\u2019 and a little bit of tax here and there, but substantive taxation reform and a real vision as to what our country should look like, and what it would look like under a Coalition government.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the Coalition\u2019s central slogan \u2013 \u201cGetting Australia Back on Track\u201d \u2013 and questioned its meaning.\n\n\u201cWe talked a lot about getting Australia back on track, but the question is: back on track to what?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t set that. We didn\u2019t make that clear.\u201d\n\n(Side note: I asked Hamer this very question during the campaign \u2014 what does the slogan actually mean? You can watch what she said at the time below.)\n\nHamer said voters, especially in Kooyong, wanted to \u201cbe treated like adults\u201d and engage with real policy.\n\n\u201cThey want to have that adult discussion where we can actually say, \u2018Here\u2019s a policy on income tax indexation\u2019. Yeah, it\u2019s complex to explain to people, but people are willing to take the time to understand that and understand how it\u2019s going to make their lives better.\u201d\n\nAsked if Peter Dutton remained unpopular with women, Hamer sidestepped the gender framing.\n\n\u201cI think it just comes down to what alternative vision we were providing \u2026 how clear was that? In this uncertain global environment, where on the one hand you\u2019ve got Trump running around doing different things, and then an economy which is really going in the wrong direction, and a cost-of-living crisis,\u201d Hamer said.\n\n\u201cWe needed to be able to say to people that we were a safe pair of hands. That they could trust us to run the country in a way that was going to make their lives better, and I don\u2019t think that we did enough to show that we could do that.\u201d\n\nHamer also acknowledged that the Liberals are struggling with younger voters \u2013 a cohort she\u2019s part of at just 31 \u2013 and said the party\u2019s approach to digital campaigning needs serious work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more we can do in the social media and digital marketing space.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of our content on social media is still very much geared towards \u2026 letting people know who the candidate is. So you have a video that says, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Amelia!\u2019 and after a while, people start to go, \u2018Yeah, I know that Amelia Hamer\u2019s my candidate, but tell me something more.\u2019\n\n\u201cTraditionally, you didn\u2019t need to, but today you do need to tell them something more, and you need to tell them something that\u2019s hyper relevant to them.\u201d",

Tatola has gone from caretaker captain to out of the 17 within a week. Bennett, meanwhile, has welcomed back Latrell Mitchell from a one-game suspension and immediately reinstated him at fullback, replacing the dynamic Jye Gray, who drops back to the interchange bench. Halfback Jamie Humphreys has also been recalled after recovering from a hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for the past four games. He will partner Jayden Sullivan in the halves, with Cody Walker and Jack Wighton on the injured list.\n\nIn contrast to Bennett, Brisbane coach Michael Maguire has shown faith in the Broncos, retaining the majority of his squad who were thumped 32-8 by Penrith last week. Their only change is the inclusion of Fletcher Baker on the bench. Maguire resisted the urge to rush back Ezra Mam, who has completed a nine-game suspension for a drug-driving offence. Mam will instead return in the Queensland Cup. In other team news, David Fifita appears set to continue serving his reserve grade penance after being left out for the second consecutive week by Gold Coast coach Des Hasler for their clash with the Knights in Newcastle on Friday.

Cronulla centre interested in joining best of British in Ashes series He\u2019s a proud Cook Islander, but emerging Cronulla centre KL Iro has expressed interest in representing England in the end-of-season Ashes series against the Kangaroos.\n\nIro qualifies for a possible England call-up because he was born in Leeds in 2000 while his father Kevin \u2013 one of the best centres of his era \u2013 was playing for Super League heavyweights St Helens. Emerging Cronulla centre KL Iro was born in England. Credit: Getty Images While KL remains committed to helping the Cook Islands qualify for the 2026 World Cup, he admitted the prospect of playing for England held appeal \u2013 especially given Australia are set to embark on a three-Test tour of the Old Dart for the first time in 22 years. Mal Meninga\u2019s Kangaroos will play Tests at Wembley, Everton and Headingley and, judging by early ticket sales, huge crowds are anticipated for what shapes as a landmark series. Asked if he would be interested in representing the land of his birth, Iro replied: \u201cYeah, for sure. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m eligible. I\u2019m not sure how it works.\n\n\u201cBut, yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say no ... I would never say no to that, bro. I think it\u2019s pretty cool if you could do that.\u201d The 25-year-old has strung together 29 NRL games for the Sharks, scoring 12 tries \u2013 including six in five games this season. Dolphins centre Herbie Farnworth has played six Tests for England and presumably will be one of the first players picked to face the Kangaroos. Farnworth partnered Harry Newman, of Leeds Rhinos, in last year\u2019s home series against Samoa, which the Lions won 2-0. Herbie Farnworth is likely to be the first centre chosen for England in the Test series against Australia. Credit: AP\n\nOther NRL-based players likely to feature for England include Roosters duo Victor Radley and Dominic Young, Canberra forwards Morgan Smithies and Matty Nicholson, Newcastle back-rower Kai Pearce-Paul and North Queensland veteran John Bateman. Roosters half Sam Walker and Canterbury prop Max King are both also eligible because, like Iro, they were born in England while their fathers were playing in the Super League. Loading After his dad retired in 2001, the Iros returned to Rarotonga, where KL spent most of his childhood before eventually moving to Auckland, and then Australia. He has since represented the Cook Islands in eight internationals. \u201cCook Islands is my strong point, and that\u2019s where I grew up, and that\u2019s my culture \u2026 after my career, I probably want to move back there as well,\u201d Iro said.\n\nHe added that his \u201cmain goal\u201d this year was to help the Aitu in their World Cup quest, and hopefully provide young Cook Islanders with inspiration. \u201cWhen I was growing up back there, I always had my dad as a role model to follow, so I hope that I can be, like, a role model for the younger kids that it is possible to get out of the island and achieve good things,\u201d he said. Iro explained his recent decision to change from his Christian name of Kayal to \u201cKL\u201d, saying it was partly because it was often mispronounced, but also a tribute to his father, who was christened Kevin Leslie Iro. \u201cMy dad always wanted that, and I like it that way too, because it\u2019s easier to pronounce,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no confusion around pronunciation and stuff like that as well. \u201cWhen I first moved to Australia, my dad always wanted me to change it. I\u2019m a shy guy, so, like, I\u2019m just too scared to step on anyone\u2019s toes ... but I guess I\u2019ve built a relationship with these fellas now, so I thought I\u2019d just ask a question and they got it done pretty quick.\u201d",

    "text": "Investment bank Macquarie Group was down 0.3 per cent after the markets regulator ASIC called it out over \u201csignificant compliance failures\u201d in its futures dealing business and over-the counter derivatives trade reporting. Loading Continuing their trend from Tuesday, the worst performing sectors were health care and consumer discretionary stocks, down 1.5 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively. Health care\u2019s biggest hits were at imaging software company Pro Medicus (down 2.3 per cent), hearing device maker Cochlear (down 2 per cent) and biotech firm CSL (down 1.7 per cent). In consumer discretionary, JB Hi-Fi was down 5.4 per cent \u2013 making it the worst performing stock of the morning \u2013 after a trading update showed its sales growth slowed in the March quarter. On Wall Street overnight, stocks fell and bonds rose as Trump said he would prescribe tariff levels and concessions for partners looking to avoid higher duties, appearing to move away from the idea that he would engage in back-and-forth negotiations. After almost wiping out losses, the S&P 500 closed with a drop of 0.8 cent. The Dow Jones was down 1 per cent and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9 per cent.\n\nPalantir Technologies was one of the heaviest weights on Wall Street after falling 11.9 per cent. The company, which offers an AI platform for customers, dropped even though it reported a profit for the latest quarter that met analysts\u2019 expectations and raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Loading AI-related companies have been finding it more difficult recently to convince investors to support their stocks after they\u2019ve already shot so high. Palantir\u2019s stock\u2019s price remains near $US110, when it was sitting at only $US20 less than a year ago. The return to earth for AI stocks is happening as Trump\u2019s tariffs change the economic landscape for other companies. Clorox chief executive Linda Rendle said her company detected changes in shopping behaviour during the first three months of the year, for example, that led to lower revenue. The company reported both weaker revenue and profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Clorox expects the slowdowns to continue in the current quarter, and its stock fell 2.4 per cent.\n\nToy maker Mattel, meanwhile, was swinging between losses and gains after it said it was \u201cpausing\u201d its financial forecasts for 2025, in part because the \u201cevolving US tariff landscape\u201d was making it difficult to predict how much US shoppers would spend during the holiday season and the rest of the year. Mattel ended up 2.8 per cent higher, having reported better results for the latest quarter than analysts feared. Mattel, the toy company behind Barbie, is pausing its financial forecasts amid the economic uncertainty. Credit: New York Times The toy maker was one of the latest companies to join a lengthening list that have yanked their forecasts for the year given uncertainty about what Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again rollout of tariffs will do to the economy. The hope is that Trump will relent on some of his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries. Without them, many investors expect the economy to fall into a recession. Regardless, all the will-he-won\u2019t-he uncertainty around tariffs has already made American households more pessimistic about the economy and could affect their long-term plans for purchases. That uncertainty has helped fuel a surge in imports ahead of potentially more severe tariffs ahead.\n\nThe US trade deficit soared to a record $US140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of tariffs that went into effect in April and others that have been postponed until July. That follows another update from last week showing that the US economy shrank at a 0.3 per cent annual pace during the first quarter of the year because of a surge in imports. Loading Some companies say they\u2019re already seeing impacts to their business from the uncertainty created by tariffs. DoorDash fell 7.4 per cent after reporting weaker revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter, though it may have also offered a more encouraging snapshot of how US households are doing. The company said order growth in its US marketplace remained healthy. The US Federal Reserve has begun its two-day meeting, and will announce its next move on interest rates Wednesday (Thursday morning AEST). Virtually no one expects it to do anything to its main rate, even though Trump has been advocating for cuts.",

    "text": "Max Chandler-Mather says he is \"really proud\" of his work in giving renters a voice on the national stage, as he reflected on his \"miserable\" time in parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outgoing Greens housing spokesperson said they operated against \"often very hostile two major parties\" and that he is \"quite happy\" about not spending more time in the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nChandler-Mather spoke to Triple J's Hack program after conceding his Brisbane seat of Griffith to Labor's Renee Coffey in the federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nRedbridge Group director Simon Welsh is predicting the Greens will lose the seat to Labor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I really feel really proud of a lot of the work we have done over the last three years,\" Chandler-Mather said on Tuesday evening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Perhaps what I feel most proud of is giving renters a bit of a voice on the national stage. So often we are ignored and treated like second-class citizens. It felt like at the very least we were able to force that issue onto the national stage.\"\n\n\n\n'I don't regret a thing'\n\nHe said the result \"is always a possibility\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was always going to be a risk, when you're fighting these really big institutions \u2014 the property and banking industry, the major political parties, parts of the media establishment \u2014 and you're going out there saying renters deserve a little bit, and people on low incomes deserve a bit more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was always going to be a risk that you were going to cop a bit of hostility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I take that as a point of pride, but it always comes with risk. I don't regret a thing, really.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he said he feels he has let a lot of people down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We helped build a lot of hope and then we lost in Griffith. Ultimately, I have to take responsibility for that.\"\n\n\n\nA 'bloody awful', 'miserable' workplace\n\nThe election was a night of mixed results for the Greens, with the party losing two of its Brisbane seats.\n\n\n\n\n\nParty leader Adam Bandt's seat of Melbourne remains undecided at time of publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this, Bandt said on Monday that the party has received a record Senate vote this election, and is on track to take 11 upper house seats.\n\n\n\n\n\nChandler-Mather said the Greens were subject to a \"massive collapse in the Liberal vote that transferred to Labor\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were operating against often very hostile two major parties,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'll be honest \u2014 one of the things I'm quite happy about at the moment is I don't have to spend more time in the House of Representatives. Because basically every time I stood up, I got screamed and yelled at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In terms of a workplace, it was bloody awful, and frankly a lot of the time, miserable.\"\n\n\n\nLater responding to a question on criticisms directed towards the Greens, including slowing progress on issues such as housing and undelivered promises like rent freezes, he said: \"Parliament is a sick place, can I just say? Genuinely.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were times when I was sitting in parliament and you'd watch both sides of politics team up to defend the stage three tax cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then we were getting attacked because we said we should spend a bit more on public housing and give something for renters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel proud of that work \u2026 and I think if I had my time again, I would do it all again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Did it have an effect? Maybe that lost us some votes.\"\n\n\n\n'Of course we have fallen short'\n\nChandler-Mather acknowledged the party had fallen short when it came to lower house seats \u2014 which was \"bitterly disappointing\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I think there is a lot of reason for hope,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to work out how to do better.

    "text": "Tens of thousands of influenza cases have already been reported in Australia so far this year , and with flu season around the corner, experts are concerned that many people aren't taking the consequences seriously enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 63,000 flu cases have been reported this year, tracking above the average number of cases for the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of cases seen so far, combined with a persistently low vaccination rate for flu, have set off alarm bells in the medical community.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) called for action after over 48,000 cases were reported in the first quarter of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, there were 30,494 cases, and in 2023, there were 18,582 cases in the same period.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Severe 2025 flu season likely, prompting calls to get vaccinated SBS News 06/01/2025 06:50 Play\n\nRACGP president Dr Michael Wright said vaccination rates for the flu have fallen and brought attention to the most severe consequences of the illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More than 1,000 deaths last year involved the flu, a 67.3 per cent increase on 2023, while more than 4200 people were admitted to hospital,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the number of cases seen in flu seasons is difficult to predict, as Australia moves into the colder months, there will be an exponential increase in the number of cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlu seasons have become harder to predict since the COVID-19 pandemic, so it's currently unclear whether this season will continue on its record trajectory.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, professor Julie Leask from the University of Sydney said the consequences of the flu can be serious, regardless of comparisons to previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't necessarily need to be a record flu season for it to be important,\" she said.\n\n\n\nIn January, 16 Australians died from the flu, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\n\nImpacts of the flu\n\nThe flu is typically caused by influenza A or B, but there are many subtypes and strains of these viruses, and dominant strains tend to change year to year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe illness can cause fever and chills, sneezing, coughing, a sore throat, and gastrointestinal issues in children.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Paul Griffin from the University of Queensland told SBS News that while many people believe that flu is \"just like a cold\", it has huge impacts on the community and can cause severe illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the flu is predominantly a respiratory infection, it can have impacts on \"basically the whole body\", Griffin said.\n\n\n\nSevere bronchitis, inflammation of the brain (known as encephalitis), heart issues like myocarditis and muscle issues such as acute viral myositis can occur in rare cases. The flu is also known to contribute to heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously that's not the most common outcome from the flu, and most people won't require hospitalisation or get all of those things. But the unfortunate reality is enough people do that it's a big problem,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung children, older adults, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised people and smokers are at greater risk of severe illness or complications. But adults who don't belong to these groups can also experience these issues.\n\n\n\nLeask told SBS News the flu has a \"personality problem\" because it can be confused with other less-serious viruses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's estimated that around 3,000 people a year die from flu, whether it's on their death certificate or there's some other death, such as a cardiac death that flu brought on. That's the estimate. So, it's really quite a burdensome disease that's underappreciated,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flu also places a massive weight on the medical system every year, with hundreds of thousands of GP visits and thousands of hospitalisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The flow-on effect of that is that people who need to seek primary care or go to hospital then struggle to get those issues addressed,\" Griffin said\n\n\n\nWhy aren't more Australians getting vaccinated?\n\nVaccination rates for the flu have been trending downwards in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, 13.6 per cent of people aged 15 to 50 had been vaccinated by May, according to the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, 8.2 per cent have been vaccinated so far.\n\n\n\nLeask said Australia's vaccination rates for the flu are consistently \"dire\", and while the majority of Australians complete childhood vaccinations, the uptake of yearly flu vaccinations is more subject to motivation and access.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the flu shot is free for young children, pregnant women, adults aged 65 and older, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people with certain medical conditions under the National Immunisation Program. Most others have to pay out-of-pocket for the flu shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeask said vaccination rates are improved by services that remind Australians they're due for their shots, encourage them to get one and provide services and systems that make it as convenient as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople are also much more likely to receive the flu shot in a year if they have had at least one in the past two years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that flu vaccination is a habit, and once you start that habit, you tend to continue with it,\" Leask said.\n\n\n\nVaccination rates for the flu have been trending downwards in Australia in recent years. Source: Getty / Witthaya Prasongsin\n\nMyths about the flu vaccine\n\nHowever, there are many prevailing myths about the flu vaccination that can also discourage people from getting the shot, Griffin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne issue is that many people believe they will get sick from the flu regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. While the vaccine can't provide total coverage against infection, Griffin said there are still strong benefits to getting the shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Breakthrough infections can happen relatively commonly, so you can be vaccinated and still get the flu,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But what we know is that no matter what happens when you get the flu after you're vaccinated, it's going to help at least a little bit in terms of reducing the severity, perhaps duration, and perhaps the ability to pass it on. There's a whole host of benefits.\"\n\n\n\nLeask also stressed that vaccination is not just about protecting yourself \u2014 it is also about trying to ensure the safety of others in the community who may develop more severe illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to remind people that this is not just about protecting yourself from what could be a rotten couple of weeks laid out, days of work, feeling really crook,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I get a flu vaccine, I'm less likely to get the flu and therefore much less likely to pass it on to my old mother, who I really don't want to make sick from influenza because she could get really sick from it.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Key Points New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has proposed a social media ban for children under-16.\n\nThe proposal is similar to Australia's ban approved by parliament last year.\n\nUnder Luxon's plan social media companies would need to verify users were at least 16 years old or face big fines.\n\nNew Zealand's prime minister has proposed banning children under 16 from social media, stressing the need to shield them from the perils of big tech platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulators the world over are wrestling with how to keep children safe online, as social media is increasingly flooded with violent and disturbing content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon unveiled draft laws on Tuesday that would force social media companies to verify users were at least 16 years old, or face fines of up to NZ$2 million ($1.85 million).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed ban was modelled on strict laws recently passed by Australia , which sits at the forefront of global efforts to regulate social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's time that New Zealand acknowledged that, for all the good things that come from social media, it's not always a safe place for our young people to be,\" Luxon told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's time we put the onus on these platforms to protect vulnerable children from harmful content, cyberbullying, and exploitation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not clear when the legislation would be introduced to parliament, but Luxon said he was hopeful of garnering support across the chamber.\n\n\n\nThe laws were drafted by Luxon's centre-right National Party, the biggest member of New Zealand's three-way governing coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be passed, they would need the support of Luxon's two other coalition partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Parents are constantly telling us that they are really worried about the impact that social media is having on their children,\" Luxon said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And they say they are really struggling to manage access to social media.\"\n\n\n\n'Online exposure'\n\nThe National Party's Catherine Wedd, who drafted the bill, said it would hold social media companies to account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a mother of four children I feel very strongly that families and parents should be better supported when it comes to overseeing their children's online exposure,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed laws do not specify which social media companies would be covered in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, New Zealand banned children from using mobile phones while at school \u2014 a policy designed to turn around the country's plummeting literacy rates.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What to know about Australia's new social media ban\n\nAustralia passed landmark laws in November restricting under-16s from social media \u2014 one of the world's toughest crackdowns on popular sites such as Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut video-sharing website YouTube will likely be exempt from the ban so children can use it for their school work.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials are yet to solve basic questions surrounding the laws, such as how the ban will be policed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move sparked a fierce backlash from big tech companies who variously described the laws as \"rushed\", \"vague\", and \"problematic\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's ban is set to come into effect by December.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "With the campaign behind her \u2013 and her party reeling from a crushing national defeat \u2013 Liberal Party candidate for Kooyong Amelia Hamer has taken a swipe at her own side, including the main slogan plastered on her corflutes.\n\nThis is the most candid she\u2019s sounded all campaign \u2013 despite her own political future still hanging in the balance. Speaking with Jacqui Felgate on 3AW Drive, Hamer was asked to reflect on what went wrong for the opposition and said one theme emerged repeatedly: the campaign lacked substance.\n\n\u201cThe one piece of feedback I was hearing consistently throughout the campaign is that people wanted to see more substantial policy from us \u2013 and they wanted to see it earlier,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNot just \u2018hey nuclear\u2019 and a little bit of tax here and there, but substantive taxation reform and a real vision as to what our country should look like, and what it would look like under a Coalition government.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the Coalition\u2019s central slogan \u2013 \u201cGetting Australia Back on Track\u201d \u2013 and questioned its meaning.\n\n\u201cWe talked a lot about getting Australia back on track, but the question is: back on track to what?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t set that. We didn\u2019t make that clear.\u201d\n\n(Side note: I asked Hamer this very question during the campaign \u2014 what does the slogan actually mean? You can watch what she said at the time below.)\n\nHamer said voters, especially in Kooyong, wanted to \u201cbe treated like adults\u201d and engage with real policy.\n\n\u201cThey want to have that adult discussion where we can actually say, \u2018Here\u2019s a policy on income tax indexation\u2019. Yeah, it\u2019s complex to explain to people, but people are willing to take the time to understand that and understand how it\u2019s going to make their lives better.\u201d\n\nAsked if Peter Dutton remained unpopular with women, Hamer sidestepped the gender framing.\n\n\u201cI think it just comes down to what alternative vision we were providing \u2026 how clear was that? In this uncertain global environment, where on the one hand you\u2019ve got Trump running around doing different things, and then an economy which is really going in the wrong direction, and a cost-of-living crisis,\u201d Hamer said.\n\n\u201cWe needed to be able to say to people that we were a safe pair of hands. That they could trust us to run the country in a way that was going to make their lives better, and I don\u2019t think that we did enough to show that we could do that.\u201d\n\nHamer also acknowledged that the Liberals are struggling with younger voters \u2013 a cohort she\u2019s part of at just 31 \u2013 and said the party\u2019s approach to digital campaigning needs serious work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more we can do in the social media and digital marketing space.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of our content on social media is still very much geared towards \u2026 letting people know who the candidate is. So you have a video that says, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Amelia!\u2019 and after a while, people start to go, \u2018Yeah, I know that Amelia Hamer\u2019s my candidate, but tell me something more.\u2019\n\n\u201cTraditionally, you didn\u2019t need to, but today you do need to tell them something more, and you need to tell them something that\u2019s hyper relevant to them.\u201d",

Credit: Getty Bennett shakes up Bunnies in bid to snap losing streak South Sydney coach Wayne Bennett has replaced his entire front row for Friday\u2019s clash with Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium, as pressure mounts on the Rabbitohs to arrest a four-game losing run.\n\nAfter their 30-4 trouncing by Newcastle last week, Bennett has dropped prop Junior Tatola to 18th man and relegated Davvy Moale to the interchange bench. Hooker Peter Mamouzelos was unavailable because of a dislocated elbow. Wayne Bennett has dropped Junior Tatola to 18th man for the clash against Brisbane. Credit: NRL Photos In their absence, Jai Arrow and Keaon Koloamatangi will be the Rabbitohs\u2019 starting props, while experienced Siliva Havili has been named at hooker. Tatola has gone from caretaker captain to out of the 17 within a week. Bennett, meanwhile, has welcomed back Latrell Mitchell from a one-game suspension and immediately reinstated him at fullback, replacing the dynamic Jye Gray, who drops back to the interchange bench. Halfback Jamie Humphreys has also been recalled after recovering from a hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for the past four games. He will partner Jayden Sullivan in the halves, with Cody Walker and Jack Wighton on the injured list.\n\nIn contrast to Bennett, Brisbane coach Michael Maguire has shown faith in the Broncos, retaining the majority of his squad who were thumped 32-8 by Penrith last week. Their only change is the inclusion of Fletcher Baker on the bench. Maguire resisted the urge to rush back Ezra Mam, who has completed a nine-game suspension for a drug-driving offence. Mam will instead return in the Queensland Cup. In other team news, David Fifita appears set to continue serving his reserve grade penance after being left out for the second consecutive week by Gold Coast coach Des Hasler for their clash with the Knights in Newcastle on Friday. Loading Canterbury have welcomed Matt Burton back from suspension for their blockbuster showdown with the Raiders in Canberra on Saturday.\n\nSt George Illawarra teenager Loko Jnr Pasifiki Tonga will make his top-grade debut against the Warriors at WIN Stadium on Saturday, replacing injured Emre Guler. Experienced winger Dallin Watene-Zalezniak returns for the Warriors.

Cronulla centre interested in joining best of British in Ashes series He\u2019s a proud Cook Islander, but emerging Cronulla centre KL Iro has expressed interest in representing England in the end-of-season Ashes series against the Kangaroos.\n\nIro qualifies for a possible England call-up because he was born in Leeds in 2000 while his father Kevin \u2013 one of the best centres of his era \u2013 was playing for Super League heavyweights St Helens. Emerging Cronulla centre KL Iro was born in England. Credit: Getty Images While KL remains committed to helping the Cook Islands qualify for the 2026 World Cup, he admitted the prospect of playing for England held appeal \u2013 especially given Australia are set to embark on a three-Test tour of the Old Dart for the first time in 22 years. Mal Meninga\u2019s Kangaroos will play Tests at Wembley, Everton and Headingley and, judging by early ticket sales, huge crowds are anticipated for what shapes as a landmark series. Asked if he would be interested in representing the land of his birth, Iro replied: \u201cYeah, for sure. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m eligible. I\u2019m not sure how it works.\n\n\u201cBut, yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say no ... I would never say no to that, bro. I think it\u2019s pretty cool if you could do that.\u201d The 25-year-old has strung together 29 NRL games for the Sharks, scoring 12 tries \u2013 including six in five games this season. Dolphins centre Herbie Farnworth has played six Tests for England and presumably will be one of the first players picked to face the Kangaroos. Farnworth partnered Harry Newman, of Leeds Rhinos, in last year\u2019s home series against Samoa, which the Lions won 2-0. Herbie Farnworth is likely to be the first centre chosen for England in the Test series against Australia. Credit: AP\n\nOther NRL-based players likely to feature for England include Roosters duo Victor Radley and Dominic Young, Canberra forwards Morgan Smithies and Matty Nicholson, Newcastle back-rower Kai Pearce-Paul and North Queensland veteran John Bateman. Roosters half Sam Walker and Canterbury prop Max King are both also eligible because, like Iro, they were born in England while their fathers were playing in the Super League. Loading After his dad retired in 2001, the Iros returned to Rarotonga, where KL spent most of his childhood before eventually moving to Auckland, and then Australia. He has since represented the Cook Islands in eight internationals. \u201cCook Islands is my strong point, and that\u2019s where I grew up, and that\u2019s my culture \u2026 after my career, I probably want to move back there as well,\u201d Iro said.\n\nHe added that his \u201cmain goal\u201d this year was to help the Aitu in their World Cup quest, and hopefully provide young Cook Islanders with inspiration. \u201cWhen I was growing up back there, I always had my dad as a role model to follow, so I hope that I can be, like, a role model for the younger kids that it is possible to get out of the island and achieve good things,\u201d he said. Iro explained his recent decision to change from his Christian name of Kayal to \u201cKL\u201d, saying it was partly because it was often mispronounced, but also a tribute to his father, who was christened Kevin Leslie Iro. \u201cMy dad always wanted that, and I like it that way too, because it\u2019s easier to pronounce,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no confusion around pronunciation and stuff like that as well. \u201cWhen I first moved to Australia, my dad always wanted me to change it. I\u2019m a shy guy, so, like, I\u2019m just too scared to step on anyone\u2019s toes ... but I guess I\u2019ve built a relationship with these fellas now, so I thought I\u2019d just ask a question and they got it done pretty quick.\u201d",

    "text": "Investment bank Macquarie Group was down 0.3 per cent after the markets regulator ASIC called it out over \u201csignificant compliance failures\u201d in its futures dealing business and over-the counter derivatives trade reporting. Loading Continuing their trend from Tuesday, the worst performing sectors were health care and consumer discretionary stocks, down 1.5 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively. Health care\u2019s biggest hits were at imaging software company Pro Medicus (down 2.3 per cent), hearing device maker Cochlear (down 2 per cent) and biotech firm CSL (down 1.7 per cent). In consumer discretionary, JB Hi-Fi was down 5.4 per cent \u2013 making it the worst performing stock of the morning \u2013 after a trading update showed its sales growth slowed in the March quarter. On Wall Street overnight, stocks fell and bonds rose as Trump said he would prescribe tariff levels and concessions for partners looking to avoid higher duties, appearing to move away from the idea that he would engage in back-and-forth negotiations. After almost wiping out losses, the S&P 500 closed with a drop of 0.8 cent. The Dow Jones was down 1 per cent and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9 per cent.\n\nPalantir Technologies was one of the heaviest weights on Wall Street after falling 11.9 per cent. The company, which offers an AI platform for customers, dropped even though it reported a profit for the latest quarter that met analysts\u2019 expectations and raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Loading AI-related companies have been finding it more difficult recently to convince investors to support their stocks after they\u2019ve already shot so high. Palantir\u2019s stock\u2019s price remains near $US110, when it was sitting at only $US20 less than a year ago. The return to earth for AI stocks is happening as Trump\u2019s tariffs change the economic landscape for other companies. Clorox chief executive Linda Rendle said her company detected changes in shopping behaviour during the first three months of the year, for example, that led to lower revenue. The company reported both weaker revenue and profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Clorox expects the slowdowns to continue in the current quarter, and its stock fell 2.4 per cent.\n\nToy maker Mattel, meanwhile, was swinging between losses and gains after it said it was \u201cpausing\u201d its financial forecasts for 2025, in part because the \u201cevolving US tariff landscape\u201d was making it difficult to predict how much US shoppers would spend during the holiday season and the rest of the year. Mattel ended up 2.8 per cent higher, having reported better results for the latest quarter than analysts feared. Mattel, the toy company behind Barbie, is pausing its financial forecasts amid the economic uncertainty. Credit: New York Times The toy maker was one of the latest companies to join a lengthening list that have yanked their forecasts for the year given uncertainty about what Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again rollout of tariffs will do to the economy. The hope is that Trump will relent on some of his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries. Without them, many investors expect the economy to fall into a recession. Regardless, all the will-he-won\u2019t-he uncertainty around tariffs has already made American households more pessimistic about the economy and could affect their long-term plans for purchases. That uncertainty has helped fuel a surge in imports ahead of potentially more severe tariffs ahead.\n\nThe US trade deficit soared to a record $US140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of tariffs that went into effect in April and others that have been postponed until July. That follows another update from last week showing that the US economy shrank at a 0.3 per cent annual pace during the first quarter of the year because of a surge in imports. Loading Some companies say they\u2019re already seeing impacts to their business from the uncertainty created by tariffs. DoorDash fell 7.4 per cent after reporting weaker revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter, though it may have also offered a more encouraging snapshot of how US households are doing. The company said order growth in its US marketplace remained healthy. The US Federal Reserve has begun its two-day meeting, and will announce its next move on interest rates Wednesday (Thursday morning AEST). Virtually no one expects it to do anything to its main rate, even though Trump has been advocating for cuts.",

You have 48 hours to return and properly clean up the mess. If not, we will have no choice but to circulate photos from the footage to identify you. Please do the right thing,\" the sign read.\n\nJust three days later, it appears the driveway dumper struck again, this time at a home in Norwood, only five minutes down the road. Home security footage captured a woman wearing a pink bucket hat, a mask, and \u2014 fittingly \u2014 gloves, slipping behind a fence, crouching down, and appearing to relieve herself during an early morning escapade.\n\nThe local resident was less than impressed, so fought back in a very public way. Source: 7News\n\nAdelaide's inner suburbs targetted by rogue pooper\n\nThe owner of the home told 7News he walked outside to find the unwelcome surprise wrapped in a napkin and was forced to clean up the filth himself. It's understood both recent incidents took place before 7.30am.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne local branded the rogue relief-taker \"a bit sick\". \"I don't know what their problem is,\" she told 7News. Another labelled the act \"pretty disrespectful\" while one local labelled it simply \"gross\".\n\nTwo women have been caught in the act in adjacent suburbs in the space of just days. It currently remains unknown if they are the same person. Source: 7News\n\nIt's not the first time a mystery defecator has caused frustration in suburban streets \u2014 both Sydney and Brisbane have, in recent years, seen strange cases of individuals leaving human waste in public or private areas, often under the cover of darkness.\n\nIn one Sydney incident, a jogger was caught repeatedly relieving themselves outside the same business premises, earning them the nickname \"the poo jogger.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBrisbane residents were similarly disturbed after a string of unexplained driveway incidents that left authorities scratching their heads and locals calling for increased patrols. The mystery man was later identified as a corporate manager, after he was photographed with his pants down on a suburban street.\n\nHe was suspected of having relieved himself more than 30 times outside a city apartment block. The man was later forced to resign from his high-ranking position after pictures of him in the act went viral.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
