(Supplied)\n\nStressed, Rosenthal left work for a regular acupuncture appointment.\n\nIt was during this quiet time that she usually felt her daughter move.\n\nBut not this time.\n\n\"I just thought, 'No, I'm not feeling her',\" Rosenthal said.\n\nNow very concerned, Rosenthal called her husband, who took her to the hospital.\n\n\"I went in and was sat in the waiting room,\" Rosenthal said.\n\n\"It was obviously a very busy shift in the delivery suite.\"\n\nA staff member came out to the waiting room and put a cardiotocography (CTG) monitor on Rosenthal to measure the baby's heart rate.\n\nThe measurements reassured staff, who detected a heartbeat before returning to the ward.\n\nHowever, Nerida wasn't reassured and suspected it was her own heartbeat, elevated by anxiety, that was picked up by mistake.\n\nInstinct told Rosenthal something was very wrong, and she refused to leave the hospital despite being given the all clear.\n\n\"I knew it in my gut and I said, 'I'm not leaving here based on a CTG, I need a scan',\" she said.\n\nRosenthal's obstetrician arrived at the hospital and immediately performed an ultrasound, which confirmed her worst fears.\n\n\"The doctor just turned to me, and he had tears in his eyes. He said, 'You're right. There's no heartbeat',\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff First images of secretive Border Force operation\n\nNerida Rosenthal, pictured with her daughter Mia, who was stillborn. (Supplied)\n\nRosenthal's daughter had suffered an umbilical cord accident.\n\nThe cord was wrapped around her neck twice and kinked, stopping the blood flow.\n\nAround 2380 families are affected by stillbirth every year in Australia.\n\nIt's a rate that has remained largely unchanged over the last two decades.\n\nIn 2022, the rate of stillbirths even increased slightly to 8.0 per 1000 births, up from 7.2 per 1000 births a year earlier, according to the latest available data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.\n\nIn 2018, a Senate inquiry examined the lack of movement on Australia's stillbirth rate.\n\nIn response, the National Stillbirth Action and Implementation Plan was launched in 2020, which included a federal government target to reduce the number of stillbirths by 20 per cent by December 2025.\n\nWhile Rosenthal believes her daughter Mia's death was unpreventable, she, alongside many other bereaved parents, is calling for change around this issue\n\n\"It's just crazy that the stats haven't changed in all of this time,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that some of these stillbirths are preventable. So what can we do to prevent them?\n\n\"You're not going to save everyone, but we still need to raise awareness for the type of early checks that can save someone.\"\n\nIn September, a parliamentary petition collected more than 6000 signatures, calling for a national stillbirth awareness campaign.\n\nThe petition was launched by Tim McCranor, who, along with his wife Michelle, lost their baby daughter Celeste in 2001.\n\nThe couple's advocacy has also included the making of a recently released documentary called Her Name is Celeste .\n\nWhy haven't stillbirth rates improved?\n\nDespite medical advancements in other areas of health, stillbirth rates have stagnated and even showed a slight uptick in 2022, when the highest rate in 20 years was recorded.\n\nIn its analysis, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) said there had been no consistent trend over the past few decades when it came to the number of stillbirths.\n\nHowever, some fluctuations had coincided with key events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2019\u201320 bushfires, and changes in the underlying birth rate, AIHW said.\n\nA graph showing the rates of stillbirth in Australia over the past two decades. (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare)\n\nSome of the increase in 2022 could be attributed to the improved capture and inclusion of cases in some areas, it said.\n\nVicki Flenady is the director of the Stillbirth Centre of Research Excellence (CRE), a peak body leading the effort to prevent stillbirths in later gestation, from 28 weeks onwards.\n\nFlenady said possible factors which may have influenced stillbirth rates included disruptions to maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic and inequity in care.\n\n\"Stillbirth disproportionately affects marginalised groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women from some migrant and refugee backgrounds, women under the age of 20, and women from rural and remote areas,\" Flenady said.\n\n\"These disparities are linked to factors like social disadvantage, intergenerational trauma, and limited access to culturally safe healthcare.\"\n\nIt is estimated that about 20-30 per cent of stillbirth deaths in late gestation are preventable.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Woman charged with murder a month after elderly woman found dead in bed\n\nNerida Rosenthal and other bereaved parents are calling for the federal government to implement a national stillbirth awareness campaign. (Supplied)\n\nWhile the national overall figures for stillbirths measured deaths from 20 weeks onwards, one area which had shown improvement was in later gestation from 28 weeks, Flenady said.\n\n\"In this group, there has been a downward trend,\" Flenady said.\n\n\"The average annual rate reduction reveals a 3.1 per cent decrease in late gestation stillbirth rates in the decade to 2022.\"\n\nA key stillbirth prevention strategy in the National Stillbirth Action and Implementation Plan has been the rollout of a Safer Baby Bundle in higher-risk communities and clinical settings through Stillbirth CRE.\n\nThe bundle helps clinicians identify women at a higher risk for stillbirth and provides strategies for their care.\n\nModelled on the UK's National Health Service's (NHS) Saving Babies' Lives Care, the bundle has shown promising early results, Flenady said.\n\n\"Pre-COVID Victorian data show a 21 per cent reduction in stillbirths occurring at 28 weeks' gestation or more where the Safer Baby Bundle has been embedded.\"\n\nLack of real-time data hinders efforts\n\nOne major factor hampering the efforts to reduce the stillbirth rate is the lack of real-time data, Flenady said.\n\nThere is currently a three-year delay in the release of stillbirth statistics by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.\n\n\"Access to timely, comprehensive data limits the ability to measure, in real time, the impact of prevention initiatives or other factors that influence stillbirth rates,\" Flenady said.\n\n\"In addition, there is a two-year delay between the occurrence of a stillbirth and its inclusion in data sets made available for analysis.\"\n\nThe National Stillbirth Action and Implementation Plan identified the need to improve data collection on stillbirths and committed in the medium term to \"develop and implement a standardised approach to data collection on causes and contributing factors for perinatal deaths, across maternity services linked to perinatal mortality review committees to ensure timely review and reporting of stillbirth deaths\".",

    "text": "Perched on a hill overlooking the railway town of Junee in southern New South Wales, the Monte Cristo Homestead has long claimed to be Australia's most haunted house.\n\nFor the past 63 years, people have travelled from far and wide to visit the 140-year-old Victorian manor, drawn by whispers of ghostly encounters and chilling folklore.\n\nThe house is now on sale after the death of its former owner, with Junee Mayor Bob Callow saying its peculiar history was an attraction.\n\n\"People have said yes, they have experienced things here,\" he said.\n\n\"It has obviously drawn the attention of people with that sort of interest.\"\n\nOne of the bedrooms inside the Monte Cristo mansion in Junee. (ABC Riverina: Jostina Basta)\n\nCr Callow hopes any future buyers of the iconic house will honour its legacy.\n\n\"It would be hard for the town if someone came and just turned it into a house or an Airbnb,\" he said.\n\n\" To have it come back as a tourism venue would be the best outcome. \"\n\nThe Monte Cristo Homestead overlooks the railway town of Junee in southern New South Wales. (Supplied: Ray White Junee)\n\nFrom a slab hut to a mansion\n\nThe property started as a small slab hut, but Christopher Crawley and his wife Elizabeth turned the property into a Victorian-styled manor in 1885, where they raised their seven children.\n\nAt the time, the property was a testament to the couple's growing wealth and success, becoming a status symbol and one of the region's social centres, according to the homestead's official website.\n\nThe Crawleys hosted balls for the town's wealthy and powerful.\n\nBob Callow is hoping the next owners will breathe new life into the famous homestead. (ABC News: Rachel Holdsworth)\n\nCr Callow said the homestead was not the only legacy the Crawleys had left the town.\n\n\"They built the big Junee Hotel, they had a general store next door, and a theatrette,\" he said.\n\n\"They did a lot of things for the town itself.\"\n\nTragedy struck the family after Mr Crawley died of blood poisoning. Other family members also experienced untimely ends within the homestead's walls.\n\nGail Commens is the secretary of Junee's Roundhouse Railway Museum. (ABC News: Jostina Basta)\n\nGail Commens, from the town's Roundhouse Railway Museum, said as a local for more than 70 years, she had heard many different stories from visitors and tourists over the years.\n\n\"People swear and declare that they've seen things, they've heard things, they've felt something on their shoulder, like a hand,\" she said.\n\n\"It's what you believe, I guess.\"\n\nThe Monte Cristo homestead is fitted out with Victorian-era furniture. (Supplied: Ray White Junee)\n\nRestoring an almost-demolished property\n\nBy the time the late Reginald Ryan and his wife Olive purchased the 18-room property, it had been abandoned for more than a decade and on the brink of collapse.\n\nCr Callow said the couple did a lot of work to restore the home to its former glory, adding their own unique touch.\n\nAnd because Mr Ryan was a \"great storyteller\", he turned the property's history into a gripping tale.\n\n\"When they first picked it up, it was an absolute wreck \u2026 Reg rebuilt the place in such a way that it became an iconic part of the town and internationally known,\" Cr Callow said.\n\nDolls are the only current tenants in the homestead. (ABC News: Jostina Basta)\n\nThe couple turned the ramshackle mansion into a monument of the bygone Victorian era it was built in \u2014 both as an attraction and a home alongside their five children.\n\nVisitors could book ghost tours in the homestead, or if they dared, stay overnight to fully immerse themselves in its history.\n\nThe tour organisers claimed multiple ghosts haunted the house, including the ghost of Christopher Crawley.\n\nOne of the bedrooms in the Monte Cristo mansion with portraits on the wall. (ABC Riverina: Jostina Basta)\n\nVisitors have claimed to have had paranormal encounters, including objects moving on their own, figures visiting their bedrooms at night, ghostly apparitions and strange smells.\n\n'A pinnacle listing' with an uncertain future\n\nProperty manager Jason Barrett said it was not just the Monte Cristo's \"haunted\" reputation that was part of the appeal.\n\nAlongside the mannequins and dolls watching over visitors, whoever buys the house for the second time in its 140-year history will inherit its Victorian-styled decorative wallpaper, blood-red drapery curtains, quaint antiques and pink chandeliers.\n\nJason Barrett is a real estate agent at Ray White, Junee. (ABC News: Rachel Holdsworth)\n\nMr Barrett said the \"one of a kind\" listing had garnered lots of attention.\n\n\"I've been blown away by the interest \u2026 there's been enquiries from right across the country,\" he said.\n\nMrs Commens said it would be a \"shame for the whole town\" if the house lost its rich history because many people visited other attractions in Junee during their stay.\n\n\"Film crews came, people came all over the world to see it, and to see us ... you don't get a house like that everywhere,\" she said.",

Here's what we know.\n\nACT Education Minister Yvette Berry spoke to reporters this morning. See how it unfolded live.\n\nMs Berry said Kadink Decorative Sand was used in some Canberra schools for sensory play and arts and craft.\n\n\"WorkSafe ACT have advised the risk of exposure to traces of chrysotile is low, however the safety of students, staff and families is our highest priority,\" Ms Berry said.\n\nThe ACCC issued a recall notice over colourful sand used in children's products. (Supplied: ACCC)\n\nTesting already underway\n\nMs Berry said the decision to shut schools was only made last night after a late meeting with the ACT Work Safety Commissioner and the Education Directorate.\n\n\"This is a low risk and I heard that firsthand from the WorkSafe Commissioner last night,\" she said.\n\n\"However, it is a type of asbestos fibre or dust and so we need to take it seriously and remediate it appropriately.\"\n\nYvette Berry says closing schools was a \"precautionary measure\". (ABC News: Monte Bovill)\n\nShe said testing had already started on the affected sites.\n\n\"So far, the testing is not showing that there are any airborne fibres or any issues like that,\" she said.\n\nWorkSafe notified last week\n\nACT Work Health and Safety Commissioner Jacqueline Agius said WorkSafe ACT had become aware of the potential asbestos risk late last week.\n\n\"That was an unverified test,\" she said.\n\n\"WorkSafe ACT seized some of the product from a premises in the ACT and had our own testing conducted.\n\n\"That testing came back on Wednesday. As soon as we were aware that the test showed a positive for chrysotile asbestos, we provided that information to the community.\"\n\nJacqueline Agius says \"tests are happening all over the country at the moment\". (ABC News: Monte Bovill)\n\nMs Agius said the Education Directorate was \"acting out of an abundance of caution\".\n\n\"Asbestos in sand is a naturally occurring substance because it comes from quartz and it's quite heavy so when asbestos is heavy then it's difficult to breath it in,\" she said.\n\n\" So that's why we say the risk is low. \"\n\nSand used in various settings\n\nEducation Directorate deputy director-general Angela Spence said schools had been using the sand for sensory activities in a variety of settings.\n\n\"It can be used as part of manipulative play materials. It can also be used to provide sensory support for young people as part of their regulation,\" she said.\n\n\"In terms of the location across a school setting, it can be used in trays, out on desks, it can be used in open-plan areas, in outside sensory areas as part of that particular support.\"\n\nAngela Spence says it was a \"significant\" operational effort to suddenly close the schools. (ABC News: Monte Bovill)\n\nMs Spence said the decision to close schools was not taken lightly and required a \"significant\" operational effort.\n\n\"In order to isolate the site and maintain business can often be challenging in a school-based environment,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that this is a disruption to the community and so when we do need to make those decisions, it is based on the information through our risk assessments that inform that.\"\n\nThe closures affect the following schools:\n\nWhole school closures:\n\nBlack Mountain School\n\nCampbell Primary School\n\nCharles Weston School\n\nCharnwood-Dunlop Primary School\n\nEvatt Primary School\n\nFlorey Primary School\n\nLatham Primary School\n\nLyons Early Childhood School\n\nMalkara School\n\nNamadgi School\n\nChapman Primary School\n\nCranleigh School\n\nMiles Franklin Primary School\n\nFraser Primary School\n\nWanniassa Hills Primary School\n\nPartial school closures impacting multiple cohorts:\n\nCharles Conder Primary School \u2014 Preschool and Small Group Program\n\nNorth Ainslie Primary School \u2014 Preschool and Year 1\n\nTorrens Primary School \u2014 Preschool, Kindergarten and Year 1\n\nWanniassa School \u2014 Preschool to Year 6\n\nYarralumla Primary School \u2014 Montessori, Kindergarten, Year 1, Small Group Program\n\nThrosby School \u2013 Kindergarten, Year 1 and Year 2\n\nAmaroo School \u2013 Small Group Program\n\nPreschool closures only:\n\nCurtin Primary School \u2014 Preschool\n\nKingsford Smith School \u2014 Preschool including Koori Preschool\n\nNarrabundah Early Childhood School \u2014 Preschool including Koori Preschool\n\nMount Rogers Preschool\n\nMonash Preschool\n\nDuffy Preschool\n\nTeddybears Childcare Centre\n\nBlack Mountain School is one of the schools closed in Canberra today. (ABC News: Monte Bovill)\n\nMs Berry said parents would be advised of the closures via email and text messages.\n\nShe also pointed parents to the ACT's education website, which is constantly being updated on the issue.\n\nParents of students impacted by the school closures should find out by Sunday afternoon if their school will reopen on Monday.\n\n\"We will be formalising communication through each of our schools of the impacted sites on Sunday afternoon,\" Ms Spence said.\n\n\" Should we be in a position to release information earlier we will do that because we know that the impact on families is pretty significant. \"\n\nWhy has the ACT closed so many schools?\n\nWhen asked why the ACT had closed so many schools compared to other jurisdictions, Ms Berry said it could be because the ACT's regulator was \"on the ball\".\n\nParents at Campbell Primary School were told to keep their children at home today. (ABC News: Monte Bovill)\n\n\"The information on WorkSafe equivalent sites across the country is very similar,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it was just that our WorkSafe Commission took the next step to do their own testing.\n\n\"We surveyed our schools to see how widespread it was and how much the sand was being used across our schools.\"\n\nOne school in Brisbane has been closed today, while a Queensland school has alerted parents of its use of the sand, though it remains open.",

    "text": "Bowlers who take six wickets in an innings would usually class the outing as one of their best.\n\nIn the case of England skipper Ben Stokes, who took 6-52 against the England Lions in a tune-up match on Thursday, the performance is one he is likely to forget.\n\nStokes took the wickets of Tom Haines, Jacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Rehan Ahmed, Will Jacks and Tom Lawes as the Lions amassed 382 off just 79.3 overs.\n\nThe tour match, England's sole outing prior to the first Test in Perth, was not televised, and as such, the truth about Stokes's six-wicket haul only came to light once England Cricket's X account began to release highlights of each wicket.\n\nStokes first removed Haines, the captain of the Lions, with a short delivery as the left-hander miscued a pull shot. The celebration was muted, as you'd expect given this is essentially an intra-squad match.\n\nNext up was Bethell, regarded by many as one of the most promising young batters in England.\n\nStokes came around the wicket and dug another one in short, Bethell pulled it away and like Haines, hit it straight to a fielder. This time, the Stokes reaction was brilliant, as he rested his head on one hand almost in embarrassment.\n\nThe theme continued for Stokes's next wicket as Cox was caught on the boundary pulling another short one from the England captain, before Ahmed fell in virtually identical fashion.\n\nStokes brought up his five-wicket haul with another short one on leg stump as Lawes was caught by Ollie Pope as he attempted to flick the ball away. Stokes again looked towards one of his fielders in sheer embarrassment.\n\nThe best reaction was left until the end as Stokes had Will Jacks caught on the boundary with another short one on the leg side after a well-made 84.\n\nAfter Jofra Archer took the catch, Stokes again sheepishly celebrated and extended his arms out as if to ask himself how he was getting all these wickets.\n\nThe bowling performance from England's vaunted pace attack against a second-string side is not going to inspire much confidence with the first Test just a week away.\n\nAll 10 wickets came via catches, with just two taken by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.\n\nEngland speedster suffers hamstring injury in pre-Ashes tour match One of England's great bowling hopes for the summer cops a blow, as Mark Wood fails to finish the first day of a tour match.\n\nArcher, Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue combined for three wickets despite bowling a combined 41.3 overs and conceded roughly four runs an over on a fairly lifeless Lilac Hill pitch.\n\nIn what is perhaps a nod to next week's playing XI, England played without a frontline spinner, as Joe Root was used as the spin option.\n\nRoot took one wicket, but was hammered at 8.35 runs an over in his 14 overs.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the all-out pace attack's struggles, as well as Mark Wood's hamstring niggle, cause a rethink for England's brains trust.\n\nNevertheless, the half-trackers on leg stump approach is unlikely to have much success for Stokes and his men against Australia, even if the home side's batting line-up appears brittle.",

    "text": "One of Australia's leading concussion researchers has called on the NRL to strengthen its protocols to avoid players being concussed in warm-ups and then playing the match.\n\nEliesa Katoa was hospitalised and underwent brain surgery after suffering multiple blows to the head during Tonga's Pacific Championships match against New Zealand on November 2.\n\nKatoa suffered a brutal head knock in the warm-up but was allowed to play in the match, where he suffered two more head knocks.\n\nLoading...\n\nHe was in clear distress after suffering the third knock and subsequently had a seizure and later surgery for a brain bleed.\n\nHe remains in hospital in Auckland.\n\nThe NRL has reviewed the incident and interviewed relevant officials, but has said it would not release the findings until Katoa is out of hospital and in better health.\n\nNeuroscientist Alan Pearce, a professor at Swinburne University and a member of the Australian Sports Brain Bank team, said Katoa's incident should not have been allowed to happen.\n\nProfessor Pearce is an expert in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain condition that can only be diagnosed after death, and said the initial impact head knock during the warm-up clearly showed he was concussed.\n\n\"He shouldn't have played,\" Professor Pearce said.\n\n\"It was really quite concerning about the intensity of that impact in the warm-up and the fact that he also went down and showed clear signs of concussion, which surprised me that he was then allowed to play.\"\n\nProfessor Pearce cited the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport, which lays out clear rules on what to do with a concussed player.\n\nIn response to Katoa's concerning incident, Professor Pearce said he hoped the NRL would strengthen its concussion protocols.\n\n\"I would like to see stronger protocols around not allowing the player to play the game, even if it's during the warm-up,\" he said.\n\n\"We know that warm-ups and training accidents occur, but we still have to have the same level of rigour that they would have in a game.\n\n\"To let a player continue on and start the game should just not happen.\n\n\"I hope the learning experience for the NRL is to change their policy around that or strengthen it up even more so that any concussion in a warm-up means no play.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nThe NRL has independent doctors monitoring all matches from the league's central bunker to ensure club doctors do not miss potential concussion incidents.\n\nBut those doctors are restricted to only watching the vision that is televised once the game begins.\n\nProfessor Pearce said the doctors should be located at the grounds where the matches are played.\n\n\"I would like to see that independent doctors actually come to the game at the same time so they can be there as part of the warm-up,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sure there have been other incidents in the past, but not as high-profile as this.\n\n\"So, for an extra hour of an independent doctor's time \u2014 they would be renumerated for that time \u2014 so I can't see why it would be an issue that they only have to come on when the game starts.\n\n\"We shouldn't be talking about something like this in 2025, given that sport organisations like the NRL and AFL are putting athlete health front and centre and saying that the health and wellbeing of their players is the greatest priority \u2014 well, show it.\n\n\"This has been a terrible incident, and we don't want another one.\"\n\nThe NRL declined to comment on Professor Pearce's calls for changes before they released the findings of their review into Katoa's injury.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\nProfessor Pearce is also calling on Australia's other major football code, the AFL, to change its in-game concussion protocols to have independent doctors monitoring games from the ground.\n\nThe league employs concussion \"spotters\" in its central AFL Review Centre (ARC) to watch for concussions and alert club doctors.\n\nA spokesman for the AFL told ABC Sport those concussion spotters were independent doctors.\n\nThe spokesman added doctors were better placed to monitor concussions in the ARC because of their access to multiple televisions and camera angles.\n\n\"Their role is to monitor the video, make real-time assessments and communicate directly with club doctors,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"The AFL continues to invest in, and support, research into concussion, that work never ends.\"\n\nThe ABC understands that were an AFL or AFLW player concussed during a warm up, they would be subject to the normal concussion assessment.\n\nProfessor Pearce said all sporting codes had improved their concussion protocols, but added there was still work to do.\n\n\"We have made some real progress in this area, but it means that we still need to be vigilant, and we can't just sort of take things for granted anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"If this is happening at the professional level, what's happening at the community level?\n\n\"The game is played at a you know, much broader in the participation space, so we've got to be able to demonstrate at the elite level what the standard is in order for that community level to appreciate that this is a serious issue.\"",

    "text": "When Edge of Life filmmaker and artist Lynette Wallworth was 11 years old, she had a near-death experience at her grandparents' house when she had a seizure and had to be resuscitated.\n\n\"I have always had an unusual relationship to death, because I technically died,\" Wallworth says, speaking at the Adelaide Film Festival.\n\nWhat: A breathtaking documentary about how ancient knowledge can help ease our way into death Directed by: Lynette Wallworth Starring: Muka Yawanawa, Margaret Ross, Justin Dwyer When: In cinemas November 13 Likely to make you feel: Like asking why so much of Western culture has shunned discussing the biggest deal we'll ever face\n\n\"It was a classic near-death experience. I left my body, saw it below me and travelled. I met relatives I didn't know, had an incredible sensation of the reality of where I was and an overwhelming sensation of compassion.\n\n\"Then I was back in my body.\"\n\nEven though Wallworth was raised Catholic, with its teachings of miracles, mysteries and an afterlife, she found that, not unlike Dorothy returning from Oz, adults dismissed everything she experienced.\n\n\"I tried to tell people, including my family doctor and the people doing brain scans on me, but I realised very quickly that I couldn't talk about these things,\" she says.\n\n\"There's no knowledge.\n\n\" The best way I can describe it is it's like everyone I knew had lived their whole lives on the surface of a lake, and one day I fell in. \"\n\nTrial and answer\n\nWhatever your beliefs (or not) about an afterlife, one thing we can probably all agree on is our desire to have as good a death as possible, one free from pain and fear.\n\nBut as Wallworth says, we have a very \"death-denying\" culture, where we're barely able to talk about the inevitable, let alone how best to manage it.\n\nThat includes a reluctance among medical practitioners, including those working in palliative care.\n\nEdge of Life introduces us to two such doctors who are open to new ways of approaching death: Margaret Ross and Justin Dwyer.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nWallworth read about the pair conducting an Australian-first trial, adopting the drug psilocybin to conduct psychedelic-assisted therapy that would ease the passing of terminally ill patients; an ancient practice revived in modern medicine that they say yields remarkable results.\n\nThe three-year trial, which studied 35 participants, showed rapid and sustained reductions in depression and anxiety, while improving overall quality of life.\n\nResearchers say more work still needs to be done to deliver this type of therapy more broadly.\n\nWallworth felt she had something to offer Ross and Dwyer.\n\nHer eye-opening experience as a young woman led her to walk other pathways, particularly those traced by First Nations cultures.\n\nShe met Yawanaw\u00e1 shaman Tashka, from the State of Acre in the Brazilian Amazon, at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThat led Wallworth to create the Emmy Award-winning virtual reality (VR) film Awavena, centred on the gender-norm smashing journey of Hushahu, the first woman to become a Yawanaw\u00e1 shaman.\n\nLynette Wallworth met with Yawanaw\u00e1 shaman Tashka, who taught her his his culture's approach to death. (Supplied: Kismet)\n\nThe Yawanaw\u00e1 people embrace death as the next step on our journey, using psychoactive drink ayahuasca to help ease the way.\n\n\"I wanted to show, in Edge of Life, that this fear of death is not universal,\" Wallworth says.\n\n\"There are cultural differences.\"\n\nSaying goodbye better\n\nWallworth reached out to Ross and Dwyer just before COVID shook the world, requiring us all to think more keenly about death.\n\n\"I knew every subject was only allowed two experiences of psilocybin, so I thought this VR tool might be helpful for them to extend that,\" Wallworth says.\n\nAs parts of Australia were plunged into rolling lockdowns, the technology came into its own.\n\n\"I was having Zoom calls with Marg and Justin covered in PPE [personal protective equipment], exhausted from being with people who were dying alone because their families were not allowed to visit,\" Wallworth recalls.\n\n\"Nurses were holding up iPads in front of their faces so their families could say goodbye. And I said, 'We can do better than this'.\"\n\nSo, Wallworth sent her VR kit to families who would place the camera where their missing relative would normally sit.\n\n\"Someone would play the piano or read a book, and the dog would be at their feet,\" Wallworth says.\n\n\"We would upload that to the person in the hospital via a headset, so [virtually] they were back where they belonged.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just about mimicking their home.\n\nThe Yawanaw\u00e1 people first agreed to work with Wallsworth on Awavena because the VR technology also aligns with their experience of vision states that help ease the way for dying people.\n\nRos took part in the psilocybin trial in an attempt to deal with anxiety around her cancer diagnosis. (Supplied: Kismet)\n\nThe VR set-up could help the doctors re-create the calming effect of psilocybin stimulation through simulation .\n\nThrough this remarkable partnership, Wallworth, Ross and Dwyer became fast friends.\n\nWhen the pandemic subsided, she convinced them to accompany her to the Amazon, to learn from Edge of Life co-writer Tashka and his fellow shaman, Muka.\n\n\"I didn't understand how they could be using an ancient medicine, even in this synthesised form, and not be speaking to the knowledge holders who have used it for so long,\" Wallworth says.\n\n\"As Marg says in the film, 'I don't have the language for this'.\"\n\nA generous gift\n\nWatching Ross and Dwyer's minds open in Edge of Life is remarkable, as is the peace the treatment brings to many of their patients, who share their stories in the luminous documentary.\n\n\"Justin ends up saying, 'We're like babies',\" Wallworth says.\n\n\"And honestly, I really think we could do with more humility in Western culture. We have lost a lot of capacity and are on a trajectory to move even further away from the contemplative state.\"\n\nMuka speaks beautifully on the subject.\n\n\"There are many different possibilities of us understanding death, between the white man's view and Indigenous peoples,\" he says.\n\n\" Naturally, I don't want to die either. I would like to live forever and have so many stories. But we must understand and accept it. \"\n\nMuka encouraged the doctors to embrace acceptance.\n\n\"For me, this connection was like bringing light into shadow,\" Muka says.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Yawanaw\u00e1 share this wisdom freely, despite the terrible history of colonialism that has ravaged their lands and forcibly obscured their culture.\n\n\"Participating in this film strengthens the work we have done, which is asking that the original people must be respected,\" Muka says.\n\n\"When Lynette opened her heart with Tashka, and when they offered us this opportunity, I told myself, 'I'm going to take my values to the world'.\n\n\"I hope that this film may be like seeds planted in everyone's heart.\"\n\nEdge of Life is in cinemas now.",

    "text": "The BBC has apologised to US President Donald Trump for a Panorama episode that spliced together parts of a speech he gave on January 6, 2021, but rejected his demands for compensation.\n\nThe corporation also said it would not show the programme again.\n\nLawyers for Mr Trump threatened to sue the BBC for $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apologised and compensated him.\n\nThe BBC's legal team has responded to Mr Trump's lawyers and its chair, Samir Shah, has personally written to the US president to apologise.\n\n\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the BBC wrote in a retraction.\n\nDonald Trump's lawyers have threatened to sue the BBC for $US1 billion over the edit of a \"salacious\" documentary. (Reuters: Jonathan Ernst)\n\nThe BBC has reported Mr Shah's letter to the White House made it clear to the US president that \"he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021\".\n\n\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" a BBC spokesperson said to the broadcaster.\n\nThe apology comes after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.\n\nThe fallout from the scandal led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.\n\nThe dispute was started by an edition of the BBC's flagship current affairs series Panorama, titled \"Trump: A Second Chance?\" and broadcast days before the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nThe criticism surrounds the BBC's edit of a speech Donald Trump delivered before protesters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. (Reuters: Leah Millis)\n\nThe third-party production company that made the film joined three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote of Mr Trump urging supporters to march with him to the US Capitol and \"fight like hell\".\n\nAmong the parts cut was a section in which Mr Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nMr Davie and Ms Turness resigned on Sunday, local time, saying the scandal was damaging the BBC.\n\nMr Trump, a frequent critic of media outlets that interrogate his administration and personal affairs, described the BBC as \"a terrible thing for democracy\" and accused it of having \"corrupt journalists\".\n\nThe letter from Mr Trump's lawyer demanded an apology to the president and a \"full and fair\" retraction of the documentary along with other \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements\" about him.\n\nIt also said the US president should be \"appropriately\" compensated for \"overwhelming financial and reputational harm\".\n\nLegal experts have said that Mr Trump would face challenges taking the case to court, but could use the mistake to try leverage a payout.\n\nTim Davie conceded the edit in the Panorama program was \"misleading\". (Reuters: Hannah McKay)\n\nPressure on the broadcaster's top executives has been growing since The Daily Telegraph newspaper in the UK published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines.\n\nAs well as the Trump edit, the dossier criticised the BBC's coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israeli bias in the BBC's Arabic service.\n\nThe BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters \u2014 and criticism from its commercial rivals \u2014 because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual licence fee of $354 paid by all households with a television.\n\nABC/AP",

    "text": "Bottle variation is a reality, but it\u2019s misnamed. Our impression of wine varies according to what else is going on around us.\n\nBottle variation is a reality, but it\u2019s misnamed: it\u2019s actually cork variation since each one is different and, consequently, admits different volumes of air. This, of course, affects the way a wine develops over time. Also important is our own variation. Let\u2019s call it \u201coccasion variation\u201d, an expression I first heard used by Robin Day, the perceptive former chief winemaker at Orlando Wines in the Barossa. What he meant is that our impression of a wine varies according to what else is going on: what we\u2019re eating, the ambience of the space we\u2019re in, the company we\u2019re keeping and many other external influences.\n\nLet\u2019s start with ambience. This includes noise level, the smells emanating from the kitchen, the food on our plates, the scent of the person next to us at the table and whether we\u2019re sitting comfortably. Our palates also vary with our mood and health: whether we\u2019re feeling as fit as a Mallee bull or not quite 100 per cent; whether we\u2019re feeling happy or sad. And our dining companions. Who hasn\u2019t been at a table when somebody with a loud and confident voice raves about a wine and excites the entire group? Or the reverse: someone bad-mouths a wine, which causes everyone else to either dislike it or modify their opinion downwards? This sort of crowd opinion-influencing is very common. Even among professionals, sadly.\n\nIt has to be said, however, that the \u201986 Grange is a very good vintage.\n\nGot a drinks question for Huon Hooke? thefullbottle@goodweekend.com.au",

Amazon lit the fuse, launching its Prime Big Deal Days, and it was quickly followed by leading names like Myer, David Jones and Target - all before mid-October,\u201d said Shippit joint CEO Rob Hango-Zada.\n\nFor the month, luggage brand July\u2019s sales are 220 per cent higher than usual. \u201cWe wanted those cases, obviously, to last through Black Friday and the busy period, and we will be restocking, but not until December,\u201d said Pitman. Meanwhile, customer demands for lower prices, rapid delivery and seamless service are higher than ever, thanks in part to ultra-cheap ecommerce giants Shein and Temu\u2019s low prices and Amazon\u2019s same-day and next-day delivery times. Gen Z, in particular, have grown up with expectations of infinite choice on demand, and those who meet the expectations of this demographic \u2013 which will be the largest retail spenders by 2030 \u2013 will find success, Hango-Zada believes. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned that they can buy a $12 outfit at midnight and have it on their doorstep the next day delivered free of charge. The implication here is that they expect that same level of convenience everywhere else,\u201d said the ecommerce executive. \u201cOften, the difference between the retailers that are bustling and those that are struggling is the extent to which they understand - and meet the needs of - Gen Z shoppers.\u201d\n\nGeo-targeted ads: Promos are getting up close and personal July luggage made a point of sending more personalised, targeted ads to encourage customers to shop in-store instead of online. Why? People interact with the physical product, interact with store staff, encounter other items \u2013 like handbags or accessories \u2013 that they weren\u2019t planning to purchase. July encourages customers to shop in person, where people tend to buy more than they do online. \u201cWhat we see is a real opportunity to upsell customers,\u201d said Pitman.\n\nCustomers tend to spend more when they come into physical stores and can touch and feel the range of products, she confirmed. \u201cIt helps to see it in real life and test out if that bag sits on that suitcase well.\u201d Loading Meanwhile, some businesses have ditched sitewide sales to get customers to shop with them more than once through the sales season. For example, specialty sportswear store Pace Athletic has run daily November deals to keep customers coming back. \u201cMany brands have introduced early targeted offers and have been rotating these to encourage multiple purchase occasions,\u201d said Carla Penn-Kahn, the chief of ecommerce software platform ProfitPeak. \u201cThis is a smart strategy, by driving repeat purchases within a short period, brands can build customer lifetime value more quickly and make their customer acquisition costs more efficient.\u201d\n\nSmall businesses are under pressure \u2013 and opting out Markdowns are great news for consumers \u2013 but more than six in 10 small business owners report feeling pressured by the period of promotions driven predominantly by global and larger retailers. Just 39 per cent of 500 small business owners surveyed by Xero say they plan to hold Black Friday sales this year, down from 50 per cent last year, while 30 per cent say they can\u2019t afford to offer discounts. \u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller business, that discount is directly an impact on your bottom line, and you don\u2019t have the benefit of being a larger business with purchasing power,\u201d said Xero ANZ managing director Angad Soin. \u201cThere\u2019s a day-to-day cash flow reality that large businesses don\u2019t always have to feel, or don\u2019t always feel as acutely as small businesses do.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sitewide sale\u2019, \u2018everything 20% off\u2019: The ACCC is watching Loading Jewellery chain Michael Hill, Webjet, MyHouse, and Hairhouse Online were some of the businesses found afoul of the law in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s Black Friday blitz last year \u2013 and penalised for it. For example, Michael Hill held a \u201c25 per cent sitewide\u201d sale that actually excluded some products, while Webjet\u2019s advertised airfares \u201cfrom $18\u2033 that were actually three times as much by checkout after the addition of compulsory fees that were not disclosed. \u201cWe expect the ACCC to go a step further this year,\u201d said law firm Holding Redlich special counsel Emily Booth.\n\nSweeping \u201csitewide\u201d claims, was/now pricing that lacked genuine previous sale history, and \u201cup to X% per cent off\u201d claims that only apply to a selection of products will be in the ACCC\u2019s sights this year, Booth said. So will bait-and-switch tactics, like advertising pictures of clothing with a certain price tag, but finding that that item is not actually sold for the advertised price. \u201cConsumers prefer to know that everything is 20 per cent off rather than hunt through to find what is 40 per cent off.\u201d Most retailers are now flogging deals well before November 28, earning the shopping phenomenon the nickname \u201cBlack November\u201d. Credit: Simon Schluter If you spot a dodgy deal, the consumer cop on the beat is asking citizens to report them \u2013 and bring receipts. \u201cWe are putting retailers on notice,\u201d said ACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe, who said customers waiting for a Black Friday deal should make a note of prices now so they can check they\u2019re making a legitimate saving.\n\n\u201cConsumers shopping during the Black Friday sales are encouraged to report promotions or ads that raise concerns to the ACCC, including images of the potential misconduct.\u201d Scammers are lurking The shopping frenzy is fertile ground for scammers, who will fabricate fake websites, sponsored social media posts and ads to cloned websites that will collect your payment data. \u201cIn Australia, we\u2019re seeing a rise in scam emails (which began to peak around November 5) and social media ads impersonating major brands and even luxury retailers,\u201d said cybersecurity software Bitdefender security analyst Alina Bizga. Scammers will exploit shoppers\u2019 sense of urgency and trick them into acting quickly without verifying the deal\u2019s legitimacy. \u201cAustralians can also expect a wave of fake delivery notifications and smishing texts as November 28 approaches,\u201d said Bizga.",

    "text": "Loading The final designs, Hendry said, were finessed over a four-month-long exchange with her manufacturers, where they went through 35 \u201citerations and improvements\u201d. But the eleventh doll in JuJu\u2019s full line-up appears identical to what ChatGPT spat out after prompt 37. The plush toys will be sold in blind boxes from $US24 ($36). However, images created by AI are not considered copyrighted, unless the author significantly modifies it. When asked by a follower what significant modifications Hendry had made, she responded: \u201cJuJu is for the people, I reckon.\u201d One fan wrote on Instagram: \u201cYou\u2019re such a great artist. I\u2019m so disappointed to see you\u2019re using AI, the result is a subpar mishmash of things we already have.\u201d\n\nCan works created with AI be regarded as art at all? Sydney-based Australian multidisciplinary artist Timothy Johnston views generative AI as an extension of human expression. \u201cThe number of iterations that [Hendry] would have gone through, and prompts to learn \u2026 she\u2019s such a perfectionist, she\u2019s creating and creating, she\u2019s like a potter with clay, she\u2019s just not doing it by hand,\u201d he says. \u201cYou still have to have the vision and put in the time to master the AI.\u201d As Hendry noted on a video posted to Instagram: \u201cAI is like porn, it does a job, but it does not do the job!\u201d\n\nA representative for Hendry said the artist did not have time for an interview, a statement, or a response to this masthead\u2019s emailed questions. Live illustrator and art teacher Cat Long, who believes art generated wholly by AI \u2013 though she is not suggesting JuJu was \u2013 is, for now at least, very distinguishable from human creation. That\u2019s why she says the two aren\u2019t comparable. \u2018AI is like porn, it does a job, but it does not do the job!\u2019 CJ Hendry \u201cDoes AI take the soul out of art? Does it take the spark and creativity?\u201d Long wonders. \u201cThings created wholly by AI, there\u2019s probably a place for them, absolutely, in the art world \u2026 But I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re competing with art that\u2019s created for the soul.\u201d Not everyone agrees with that view.\n\nWhat it means for the artists if AI is using existing art Some commercial works are being created using already existing art and the artists are not being compensated. \u201cCreative work can now be produced by anyone without requiring the development of skills and expertise, but this is only made possible by existing creative work underpinning the process,\u201d warned federal arts body Creative Australia in a June submission to the Productivity Commission. \u201cThis work is often being used without consent or compensation, with significant potential impact on the financial viability of creative careers.\u201d Aboriginal artist Emma Hollingsworth, who sells art by the name Mulganai, says one of the reasons she wanted to bring her art to the world stage was so she could bring awareness to her people and her culture. Credit: Emma Hollingsworth/Mulganai\n\nIt\u2019s an impact felt keenly by some First Nations creatives artists, who refer to AI models training with and reproducing their art without consent as \u201cdouble colonisation\u201d. Kaanju, Kuku Ya\u2019u and Girramay digital artist Emma Hollingsworth, also known as Mulganai, simply calls it \u201ccreative theft\u201d. Loading \u201cMy art isn\u2019t just a pretty picture, it comes from my identity as an Aboriginal woman,\u201d says Hollingsworth. \u201cIt\u2019s tied to my family, ancestors, Country and stories. AI has none of that: no lived experience, no cultural memory, no spirit or connection to Country. It can imitate styles, but it cannot carry our culture or our history.\u201d In September, Hollingsworth found multiple replicas of her art being sold on Temu for $5 (the listings have since been taken down). Her art is a part of her, Hollingsworth says, but it also \u201ckeeps a roof over my head\u201d.\n\nContemporary artist Blak Douglas has also seen AI-generated images resembling his art floating around, but he\u2019s not concerned. Douglas, like Hendry, is a rebel \u2013 and his pop art-inspired portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens won him the Archibald Prize in 2022. The Dunghutti man calls generative AI the \u201cautotune of visual art\u201d, and sees it as an opportunity \u201cto reach the masses to tell them that Aboriginal art is different, modern, contemporary\u201d. Since he started painting 26 years ago, the Dunghutti man says, First Nations art has been governed by the dot paintings stereotype. \u201cIt\u2019s like this artistic analogy of keeping Aboriginal people within a mission,\u201d says Douglas. \u201cIt would be nice if the layperson Googled Aboriginal art, they might see Blak Douglas.\u201d Archibald Prize-winning modern contemporary artist Blak Douglas sees potential in generative AI to challenge people\u2019s perceptions about what Aboriginal art is. Credit: Louise Kennerley\n\nIs it \u2018autotune of visual art\u2019 or something more sinister? A through-line of Hendry\u2019s body of work is that, like Andy Warhol and Douglas, it disrupts the status quo and challenges what art is. Loading JuJu, Hendry says in an Instagram Story, is a commentary on how \u201cextraordinary and ridiculous\u201d the Labubu craze is. But long-time Hendry fan Ruby PH, a Sydney-based designer who admires Hendry\u2019s commercial success, doesn\u2019t see it. They say while it\u2019s important to engage with AI and not turn away from conversations surrounding it, they were disappointed that Hendry implied other toy makers commonly used generative AI.\n\nPH says, in their experience, people making toys have storytelling backgrounds, and develop 3D animation and illustration skills to bring their characters to life. Labubu, after all, was an original character created by artist Kasing Lung before Pop Mart made it a toy. \u201cIf you were trying to make a statement about hyper-consumerism \u2026 why just do the exact thing that it\u2019s doing? I don\u2019t see the parody in that,\u201d says PH, noting the final exhibit has yet to be unveiled. Where to now? Although Hendry has flirted with copyright infringement (she\u2019s given T-shirts away for free to avoid being sued) since picking up a pencil, there is no suggestion of wrongdoing. Hendry has also been transparent about her use of generative AI, which is one of Creative Australia\u2019s principles. Sydney-based designer Ruby PH says they admire Hendry for her commercial success and talent, but are disappointed with Hendry\u2019s use of generative AI in the initial stages of designing her JuJu exhibit. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nIn October, a proposed amendment to Australian copyright laws, which would have given tech firms carte blanche to train AI models on the work of local creatives, was quashed after a successful campaign fronted by artists including singer-songwriter Jack River (Holly Rankin). Loading This means that AI developers must seek permission before using creative works to train their models. Some visual artists, including Stephen Cornwell, are not taking any chances, using tools such as WebGlaze or Nightshade to protect their works from being scraped. Setting fair industry standards that protect creatives \u2013 such as the tech sector stepping up by remunerating, and seeking consent from, creatives to use their work \u2013 is critical to ensuring a future where both technology and culture can thrive, says Creative Australia\u2019s head of public affairs, Nicola Grayson. \u201cBeing able to use AI in a safe, ethical way is potentially quite exciting,\u201d says Grayson. \u201cIf we can work with the tech industry to really produce some great solutions, then the future will look bright.\u201d",

    "text": "Heading to Europe When preparing for a big trip, however, the rules around light don\u2019t always apply. Travelling somewhere with a time difference of several timezones or more requires a change in our light habits to help us adjust. Loading If you were preparing to travel to Europe, which is behind Australian time, you might start to slow your body clock by using bright light in the evening for about three days before you fly. Any longer is unnecessary, says Cain. \u201cIn this instance, turn the lights on, use your phone on max brightness: All the things you wouldn\u2019t normally do,\u201d says Cain. \u201cIt will gradually push your body with evening light, towards London time.\u201d\n\nThis is because bright light in the morning pushes our body clock forward, while light in the evening pushes it back. Before a recent trip to London, Cain stayed up slightly later each night with bright lights on. Then, on the flight, he used light therapy glasses to keep himself awake until about 5am Australian time. \u201cI was most of the way adjusted by the time I got there,\u201d he says. When to avoid light Returning to Australia from Europe is trickier for our bodies.\n\nThe human clock tends to delay better than it advances, which is why people find it easier to travel west than east. This is compounded by the fact that we also often land in the morning when our bodies still think it is nighttime. Typical online advice is to get lots of bright light in our destination, especially if it\u2019s morning there. Following this advice can make the jet lag worse. \u201cIn the middle of the night, there is a crossover point on the effect of light. You quickly go from maximum delaying effect of light (like a slowing of the clock) to maximum advancing (like a speeding up),\u201d explains Cain. If we are exposed to light during this time, it can slow our clocks even further, or it can send the whole system into a state where it doesn\u2019t know what time it is, says Cain: \u201cWe refer to it as light hitting the singularity.\u201d The crossover point coincides with our core body temperature dropping to its lowest point, about 90 to 180 minutes before we normally wake up. So, for someone who typically rises at 6am, that will be somewhere between 3.30am and 4.30am.\n\nThis is the time when light is least likely to occur. When we\u2019re travelling, it can be a different story. For instance, if someone travels from Paris to Perth and lands at around 10am Perth time, that corresponds to 3am Paris time, when their core body temperature is at its lowest. Loading \u201cIf a blanket recommendation is followed, and you seek sunlight immediately after arrival, this light exposure will push the clock in the wrong direction, causing it to shift later instead of earlier,\u201d says Dr Dean Miller, a sleep and performance scientist at CQ University. \u201cIn effect, you\u2019ve turned a manageable seven-hour advance into a much harder 17-hour delay \u2013 prolonging jet lag and making recovery slower.\u201d The quickest route back to local time, says Miller, would require staying in relative darkness for the first couple of hours after landing until the body is out of the crossover period.\n\nBring on the sleep Like light, depending on how we time it, melatonin can help push our body towards the new time, or away from it, thereby prolonging our jet lag. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially timing information,\u201d says Cain. Specific and flexible timing information is what many apps and people offering advice get wrong, adds Cain. And if we can\u2019t follow that advice perfectly (if we have no control over the light we are exposed to, for instance), then the advice needs to adjust. \u201cThe advice is different depending on where you\u2019re coming from and where you\u2019re going, but even the time of day of your flight,\u201d says Cain. \u201cThere are so many moving parts, and you need to understand the underlying mechanisms to get it right.\u201d\n\nWithout this understanding, \u201cit\u2019s dumb at its core\u201d, says Cain, who is developing a jet lag app, which will use light sensors and adjust its advice based on the individual. With melatonin, taking it during the day when our body isn\u2019t naturally releasing it will shift the timing of our clock, just like light. \u201cIf you\u2019re travelling from west to east across six time zones, taking melatonin in the afternoon (in your body\u2019s time) is good because it\u2019ll advance your clock and that\u2019s what you need,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut if you took it in the late night or early morning, it delays your clock and can worsen jet lag.\u201d Eat your way to a new destination Food and exercise may not shift our central clock, but they also work to 24-hour rhythms and can help align our peripheral clocks, such as in the liver.\n\n\u201cLike light, food acts as a signal to our body to help set our circadian rhythms,\u201d explains Dr Charlotte Gupta, a researcher and chrono-nutritionist at the Appleton Institute. \u201cIf we eat at a time when our body isn\u2019t primed to be digesting food, like at night, this can contribute to misaligning our internal rhythms.\u201d Good jet lag advice considers what time your body thinks it is, as well as what time it is in your destination. Credit: Getty Images And because our body is less able to digest what we eat, if our clocks are in sleep mode, it can make us feel more sluggish and prone to gastric upsets, common symptoms of jet lag. Gupta suggests eating (and exercising) in line with our light timing and sticking to light, unprocessed foods while our system adjusts. \u201cMeal timing on flights is not necessarily designed around the optimal eating timing.\u201d",

More broadly, those kinds of dismissals have contributed to a perception that Root, despite having soared to heights not reached by any other England batsman in history, is not quite a first-rate player in Australia. The empty hundreds column here was famously pointed to by former Australian coach Darren Lehmann last year when he compared Root unfavourably to Steve Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoot laughed off Matthew Hayden\u2019s recent pronouncement he would run nude around the MCG if the former skipper didn\u2019t make a century this series, but he did speak with Lehmann, a sometime mentor, about the comments on ABC Radio. \u201cHe actually did reach out to me after saying that,\u201d Root tells this masthead. \u201cEveryone is entitled to their opinion. Your job as a commentator or a pundit is to give your opinion and if people don\u2019t think I\u2019m the best player in the world, it\u2019s not going to help us win the Ashes by me getting angry about it. England star Joe Root has opened up on the Ashes battle ahead, and why it will be different. Credit: Philip Gostelow \u201cMy job is to score runs, and I\u2019ve tried to make sure that\u2019s always my main focus, and I\u2019ve got five brilliant opportunities to do that in this series.\u201d Root pauses briefly, then rolls through the past three Ashes tours of Australia, in 2013-14, 2017-18 and \u201921-22. \u201c[The] first one was a very difficult one, losing 5-0, and there was a lot of stuff going on there,\u201d Root says. \u201cThe second one was very similar. It was my first tour as captain, there were a few off-the-field things with [Cameron] Bancroft and Jonny [Bairstow] and headbutts and a few beers flying around onto people\u2019s heads and stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd the last one was COVID and, as a team, we\u2019d played 20-odd Test matches in those environments \u2013 everyone was absolutely cooked and it was a very difficult tour for a number of different reasons around that.\u201d Before the interview, I\u2019d been told that Root didn\u2019t wish to spend much time ruminating on the last Ashes tour. But now he is speaking openly about the difficulties. \u201cI remember getting to Sydney and we didn\u2019t have a coaching staff,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had me, Paul Collingwood and Graham Thorpe were the three coaches that were left, everyone else was isolating for two weeks. So there were a number of different things that didn\u2019t help. \u201cThat\u2019s not trying to take anything away from Australia and the fact they were far superior to us and outplayed us convincingly, but the fact is, this time around, I\u2019ve got all that experience to lean on, I\u2019m playing some nice cricket, I\u2019ve not got the responsibility of captaincy and the extra workload that entails, and I\u2019m determined to just enjoy what a brilliant tour it\u2019s going to be.\u201d I ask Root whether he thinks he will be able to walk to the middle with a clearer head this time, as a senior pro in Ben Stokes\u2019 team but not a titled leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, potentially,\u201d he says. \u201cAt least this time in Sydney I won\u2019t be absolutely knackered from throwing balls at the rest of the squad trying to get them ready as well, not the amount I did last time anyway. It\u2019s important to learn from previous experiences and tours, but it\u2019s also important to be where you are right now. \u201cThis series is not about me, it\u2019s about us winning an Ashes. If at any stage it starts to become that in my own mind, then I\u2019m doing a disservice to this team by not being the senior player I need to be within it. The full focus has to be around us winning. If I\u2019m scoring big runs, that\u2019s going to help. \u201cIf we come away from this and I haven\u2019t got a hundred, and we win the series, that would be probably the best achievement of my whole career. That\u2019s where it sits with me.\u201d Root with captain Ben Stokes. Credit: AP That\u2019s a big pronouncement from Root, who has always tended to do his boldest talking with the bat. Since he handed over the captaincy to Stokes in 2022, his talents have been given room to flourish. In 41 Tests over that time, Root has purred to 3654 runs at 58, striking at nearly 67 runs per 100 balls, along with 14 hundreds. He has been the beating heart of the \u201cBazball\u201d batting order, a master craftsman giving stability and security to the likes of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook around him. Partly, this is about what Root feels he owes to Stokes, a loyal deputy who put his body through plenty of pain to keep England\u2019s Test match flag flying during a period when the white-ball teams of Eoin Morgan were the ECB\u2019s priority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe threw everything into helping me out when I was England captain, put his body through a lot, [and was able to] take on the big moments in games, [and] bowl long spells,\u201d Root says of Stokes. \u201cHe would do everything he could to help my England team when I was captain, and it\u2019s now my opportunity and my turn to repay that favour. \u201cAs a senior player, whether that\u2019s in terms of performance on the field \u2013 that\u2019s the most important one \u2013 but also whether it\u2019s messaging [within the team], trying to create something outside of the norm over this period, that\u2019s my role.\u201d Something that was outside the norm for Root, as a Test player at least, was the use of the ramp or scoop shot. Sam Konstas used it to great effect on Boxing Day last year but has since struggled to pick the right moments. Root\u2019s breakdown of the shot provides a window into his batting brain. Root practises a reverse sweep in the nets in Perth. Credit: Getty Images \u201cIf it can create a little bit of chaos and take a bowler off their length, that can not only benefit you, but the guy at the other end,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the next three or four overs it could completely upset the rhythm of the game for the opposition. \u201cYou want to evaluate the risk but also see the upside of it as well. The reason you\u2019re doing it is not for Instagram clicks or a few likes here and there. \u201cOne thing I always take into account is does this situation require it, and sometimes that might be when everything is in your favour, and sometimes it might be the opposite \u2013 when everything is in the bowler\u2019s favour, and you\u2019re trying to wrestle momentum back into your hands. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an exact science to it. Sometimes the best time to do it is as randomly as possible because no one is anticipating it, and it\u2019s hard to anticipate as a bowler. That\u2019s how I try to use it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "The head of Australia\u2019s Climate Change Authority, Matt Kean, has fiercely criticised the Coalition\u2019s decision to dump net zero by 2050, accusing his former party of ignoring science and \"lining up\" with global pariah states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not a policy, it\u2019s just politics,\" Kean, a former Liberal NSW treasurer and environment minister, told SBS from the COP 30 climate summit in Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Politics doesn't change physics, and just because the Coalition is walking away from evidence and science doesn't mean the rest of the world is,\" Kean said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former energy minister said while the global community was \"doubling down\" on efforts to lower emissions, the Coalition was pandering to mining lobbyists.\n\n\n\n\"The only people that will be popping champagne corks after the Coalition's announcement yesterday are the big coal companies who stand to benefit at the cost of Australian consumers,\" Kean said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley announced on Thursday that the Liberal Party would abandon net zero, following in the footsteps of its junior Coalition partner, the Nationals, which made its own announcement earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the two parties would hold talks on Sunday to negotiate a joint climate and energy policy.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coalition meeting looms as Liberal rejects 'Nationals-lite' label after net zero dumped\n\nKean lashed the Coalition\u2019s plan to subsidise the extension of coal-fired power stations \u2014 due to retire at the end of the decade \u2014 as \"hugely expensive\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the Opposition want to underwrite coal, what they're actually underwriting is higher electricity bills for Australian consumers and businesses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cheapest way to deliver new generation capacity into the grid is renewables. That's what the Australian Energy Market operator says. That's what the Australian Energy Market Commission says.\"\n\n\n\n'Gen Z and millennials' top priority, Ley says\n\nAt the heart of Ley\u2019s energy pivot is a pledge that \"energy prices will always be more affordable under us\" \u2014 though she did not nominate an exact dollar amount that bills would drop by, as Labor did before the 2022 election .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal leader believes she can sell a cost-of-living argument to young Australians \u2014 who statistically left her party in droves at the last three elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Young Australians have told me that they care about climate, and I care about climate too,\" Ley said on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"[Dumping net zero] is about the national interest. It\u2019s about the right thing for our country, and most importantly, it\u2019s about what\u2019s right for gen Z and millennials who, right now, can\u2019t afford to buy a home, can\u2019t pay their power bills, and are looking at a government that is set to deliver them a worse standard of living than their parents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKean, a moderate who grew up in the blue-ribbon northern Sydney electorate of Bradfield \u2014 lost by the Liberal Party for the first time in its history to teal independent Nicolette Boele in 2025 \u2014 said the Coalition's energy offering was \"ideology trumping facts\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the Coalition wants to line up with Russia, with Iran and [US President Donald] Trump, and I think that's totally out of step with what the Australian community would expect from their government.\"\n\n\n\n'Modest' underwriting of coal\n\nOpposition energy spokesperson Dan Tehan has repeatedly refused to say whether the Liberals will release modelling to support its climate policy, or how much will be spent to extend the life of existing coal power stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we have said is that we will have a technology-neutral, affordable energy scheme so that there will be existing generations supported with modest and targeted underwriting, like what is occurring but only occurring for wind and solar under the Labor Party,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will release our suite of policies and that will be done with plenty of time for the Australian people to be able to look at [and] address them [before the next election]\u201d.\n\n\n\nFormer Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2014 whose party rolled him over energy policy \u2014 described the decision as \"Groundhog Day\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c[The Liberals] are guaranteeing that they will marginalise their vote. It\u2019s as though they\u2019re worried about competing with [One Nation leader] Pauline Hanson as opposed to holding [Prime Minister] Anthony Albanese to account,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the key conundrums for the Coalition now is how its stated energy objectives will align with Australia\u2019s obligations under the 2015 Paris Agreement, which does not allow for backsliding on climate targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nKean, speaking from COP \u2014 a summit Australia hopes to host alongside Pacific Nations next year \u2014 said he did not \"understand\" how the Coalition could feasibly stay in the Paris Agreement yet abandon net zero by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think they understand how they can stay in Paris and get rid of net zero,\" Kean said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's clear to me is that even though the White House has flown the white flag, the rest of the world certainly hasn't given up.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Schools in Canberra and Brisbane have announced sudden closures over concerns that some children's play sand products may contain traces of asbestos.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) earlier this week issued a recall notice for a number of coloured play sand products. Two types of asbestos \u2014 chrysotile and tremolite \u2014 have been referenced and both are naturally occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sand is used for sensory play, education, and various arts and crafts activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACT announced on Friday that 15 schools and three pre-schools would be closed, while five other schools would be partially closed. Meanwhile, a Brisbane school announced it would also close.\n\n\n\n'Low risk', says ACT education minister\n\nACT Education Minister Yvette Berry said she understood the news might be \"upsetting\" for families, but insisted the issue was \"low risk\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I understand the news will be upsetting for some families, however, WorkSafe have advised the risk of exposure to traces of chrysotile [asbestos] is low,\" Berry told reporters on Friday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, WorkSafe ACT said it had tested Kadink Decorative Sand sold in a six pack of 10 gram tubes and found traces of chrysolite asbestos. The ACCC has also referenced tremolite asbestos in its recall notice for several coloured play sand products. SBS News has contacted the consumer watchdog for clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We made the decision that this was the best action to take as a precautionary measure, noting again that it is a low risk.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Closing schools will allow testing and remediation to occur as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Asbestos likely in one in three homes across Australia SBS Audio 01:12 English\n\nTesting of the sand started yesterday afternoon and will continue, Berry said, but noted that early results had come back negative for airborne asbestos fibres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were eight test results back this morning and all eight test results were negative for airborne fibres,\" ACT Work Health and Safety commissioner Jacqueline Agius said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgius said \"tests are happening all over the country at the moment\", but that WorkSafe ACT was only testing one type of sand in its jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore school closures are possible, with Berry saying it was an \"evolving situation\".\n\n\n\nBrisbane school closes\n\nMancel College, a specialist school for children and young people with language disorders, also announced on Friday that it would close.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement posted on social media, Craig Duncan, head of college at the school in Brisbane's west, shared the ACCC's recall notice and said some of the product had been found in both the junior and senior schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While the advice is low risk and there are only minor traces, we are acting with an abundance of caution,\" Duncan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are therefore advising parents that with immediate effect we are closing the entire college today.\"\n\n\n\nWhat are the sand products that have been recalled?\n\nThe recalled products, sold at retailers including Officeworks, Educating Kids, Modern Teaching Aids, and Zart Art, include:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Kadink Sand (1.3kg)\n\n\n\n- Educational Colours Rainbow Sand (1.3kg)\n\n\n\n- Creatistics Coloured Sand (1kg)\n\n\n\n- Kadink Decorative Sand (10g 6 pack)\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficeworks was a \"major supplier\" for the sand, the ACCC said, with the products sold in Australia between 2020 and 2025.\n\n\n\nAustralia's consumer watchdog recently issues a recall notice for Kadink Sand (1.3kg), Educational Colours \u2014 Rainbow Sand (1.3kg) and Creatistics \u2014 Coloured Sand (1kg). Source: Supplied / ACCC Asbestos, a hazardous material that can cause terminal diseases, has been banned in Australia since 2003 and is not allowed to be imported except in very limited circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nInhalation of asbestos can lead to an increased incidence of some respiratory diseases, including lung cancers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACCC has said the release of respiratory fibres is unlikely to occur in its retailed state, a point echoed by Agius on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Asbestos in sand is a naturally occurring substance because it comes from quartz and it's quite heavy, so when asbestos is heavy then it's difficult to breathe it in,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's why we say the risk is low.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe said Officeworks has removed the products from sale.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said any customers who own the product should stop using it immediately, place it in a heavy-duty plastic bag, and secure it with double tape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When doing so, in an abundance of caution, customers should take precautions such as wearing disposable gloves and a mask,\" Lowe said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsbestos cannot be disposed of in general waste and must be taken to resource management facilities.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "It was meant to make healthy choices simple, but nutrition experts say the Health Star Rating system is falling short.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to its critics, the front-of-pack labelling system for food and drink lacks consistency across products, uses an algorithm that overlooks ultra-processed foods and artificial sweeteners, and \u2014 because displaying a rating is not mandatory \u2014 is more likely to be applied to products that score higher as a promotional tactic.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a five-year process in the wake of a 2019 review, Friday marks the final deadline for food and beverage manufacturers to voluntarily apply the rating to 70 per cent of relevant products.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government vowed to consider mandating the system if the target wasn't met, which appears to be the case.\n\n\n\nResearch by the Sydney-based The George Institute for Global Health found that uptake across the industry in 2025 was just 37 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nUptake has stagnated in recent years. Last November, only 35 per cent of intended products in Australia displayed a star rating, according to government data, up just a fraction from 32 per cent the year before.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandra Jones, head of food governance at The George Institute, said the government targets were \"extremely generous, yet the multibillion-dollar packaged food industry has not even come anywhere close to meeting them\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an abject failure by the industry that suggests a blatant disregard for Australian consumers who buy their products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJulian Rait, vice president of the Australian Medical Association, told SBS News mandating the system is \"the only way to ensure that there will be a benefit to consumers and not just industry from the Health Star Ratings\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seems as though food manufacturers are very selective in what they choose to use the Health Star Ratings on,\" he said. \"They tend to be using them for their healthier products and exploiting the HSR as a marketing tool, and avoiding putting it on unhealthy products.\"\n\n\n\nHow does the Health Star Rating system work?\n\nThe government initiative was introduced in Australia and New Zealand in 2014 in consultation with industry and public health stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt rates the nutritional profile of a packaged food or drink product from 0.5 to 5 stars.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Using an online calculator, manufacturers plug in four key \"negative\" nutrients which lower the score of an item: kilojoules, saturated fat, sugars and sodium.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can then add four \"positive\" inputs that increase the rating. These are:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Fibre\n\n\n\n- Protein\n\n\n\n- Fruit, vegetable, nuts and legume content (FVNL)\n\n\n\n- Concentrated fruit or vegetable ingredients such as tomato paste\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's intended to compare similar products \u2014 so cheese against other cheese products, but not cheese against muesli bars.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dickie, a research fellow in the Department of Nutrition, Dietetics and Food at Monash University, told SBS News that allowing positive components to negate negative ones is not an ideal system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This idea of being able to add enough good ingredients in to balance that out, it doesn't really work. It's still a junk food.\"\n\n\n\nLow-rated products less likely to display a rating\n\nResearch from The George Institute across more than 21,000 products last year found that 61 per cent of five-star items displayed their rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust 16 per cent of products that would receive half a star were labelled, and only 24 per cent of products that scored three stars or lower showed a rating.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Jones, of The George Institute, said in August the lack of consistency makes it difficult for consumers to compare items.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe called for a \"clear and expedient timeline\" to mandate ratings in addition to regular, independent reviews of the algorithm underlying the system.\n\n\n\nProcessing not factored in\n\nUltra-processed foods (UPFs) are made with few whole foods, created using industrial techniques, modified substances and various additives. They include products such as chips, carbonated or artificially-sweetened drinks, lollies, certain cereals and energy bars.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing is not captured by the Health Star Rating algorithm, despite growing evidence linking UPFs to numerous harmful health outcomes including heart disease and diabetes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're getting these ultra-processed foods that can go through the algorithm and say they're really healthy,\" said Dickie, whose research has looked specifically at the Health Star Rating system.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Artificial sweeteners are also not accounted for by the system, meaning zero-sugar soft drinks and cordials can rate up to 3.5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some positive adjustments were made to the rating system after a previous review, Dickie said there are still some \"fundamental flaws\" in the algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can go around the supermarket and find things that are heavily processed, you know, like Up & Go, or even artificially-sweetened soft drink \u2014 3.5,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That does not make any sense, right?\" she added. \"There's no nutritional value [in artificially-sweetened soft drink].\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial sweeteners have been linked to gut issues, she said, and can promote taste preferences for sweetened food and drinks.\n\n\n\n\"If you're having those from a young age, you're developing a taste for sweetness, which is not good for your dietary habits.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUp & Go liquid breakfast products, which contain fibre and protein, rate between 4.5 to 5 stars. Various brands of packaged chips have ratings of up to 3.5 stars. Milo snack bars have ratings of 4 stars while other snack products like LCMs choc-chip display a 1-star label.\n\n\n\nConsumers want more transparency, surveys suggest\n\nA 2024 VicHealth survey of 1,100 Australians found that nutrition information was the second most important factor influencing food purchases after price, yet many respondents said they didn\u2019t trust food labels to be transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a 2023 Cancer Council survey found 82 per cent of Australian adults believe Health Star Ratings should be included on all packaged foods.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout two-thirds said making the system mandatory would make it more useful, and 65 per cent said it would help simplify their purchasing decisions.\n\n\n\nShould a flawed system be mandated?\n\nExperts agree that a compulsory system is crucial, but differ on where to go from here.\n\n\n\n\n\nMagriet Raxworthy, CEO of Dieticians Australia, said the peak body supports making the current system mandatory, but said \"there's still opportunity for improvements\" in future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do believe it is going to set us on a motion in the right direction, and certainly enabling the Australian public to make more informed choices,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe suggested that outlier products with inaccurate ratings make up only a small fraction of the picture, but said the large majority \"do provide the right information\". She called, however, for better messaging to the public on how to appropriately read the ratings.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Sugar alternatives are on the rise. They might not be so sweet for the environment\n\n\"We know that people are comparing Health Star Ratings of products outside of groupings, and that means you're also not utilising the system correctly,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDickie, who is also an executive member of the advocacy group Healthy Food Systems Australia, said she doesn't believe the current model is fit for purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat group would not want the system mandated in its current form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our preference would be to change it to a warning-based system,\" she said.\n\n\n\nFood ministers meeting early next year\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson told SBS News that food ministers will meet early next year to review reporting on uptake and receive updates from Food Standards Australia New Zealand \u2014 the agency that develops food standards and policies for both countries \u2014 on preparatory work it has undertaken on potentially mandating the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Based on this update, food ministers will further consider whether to mandate the HSR system,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf ministers decide to mandate the system, it could still take several years before consumers see the effects on the shelves.\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson noted the existing system was designed to align with the Australian Dietary Guidelines, which don't reference processing level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose guidelines are under review, and once an updated version is released, \"consideration will be given to whether the HSR system remains aligned\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The HSR does not replace nutrition know-how. Unlike dietary guidelines, it doesn\u2019t tell you what types of food to eat or in what quantities. Just because a product has a 5 star rating does not mean you should eat it every day or in large amounts,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Health Stars help consumers to quickly and easily compare similar products. It won\u2019t help you to choose between bacon and breakfast cereal. But if you\u2019ve decided to buy breakfast cereal then it will help you to choose a healthier option.\"\n\n\n\nThe Australian Food and Grocery Council, the peak industry association for the food, beverage and grocery supply industry, told SBS News it \"supports the Health Star Rating system as a tool to help Australians make informed food choices\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For many companies, particularly small manufacturers, introducing or revising packaging involves considerable time, cost and logistical complexity,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any shift of the HSR to a mandatory measure would require adequate timeframes and support to ensure long-term planning and avoid unnecessary waste or disruption to production.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat could a different approach look like?\n\nDickie pointed out that the existing system is positively skewed \u2014 by design, every product technically has a positive star rating above 0.5, even those that rank most poorly.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch on front-of-pack labelling suggests that a warning system or negatively-skewed system is more effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Something that actually puts a warning label on junk foods and points out the products that we shouldn't be eating is going to be more effective than this kind of ranking-based system that is positive,\" she said.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The FIFA World Cup qualifiers are entering a crucial stage, with some major teams battling to secure their tickets to the 2026 men's tournament in Canada, Mexico, and the US, while others are celebrating historic first-time qualifications.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 28 teams already confirmed for the 2026 men's World Cup, 20 spots remain.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting 14 November, a slew of qualifying games will be played, and 14 more spots will be locked in by the 19 November.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first time the World Cup will feature 48 teams, following the tournament's expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome smaller teams have already secured qualification, but several high-ranked footballing nations are yet to secure their berth, and past World Cup champions are currently facing an uphill battle.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How to watch the FIFA World Cup 26\u2122 Final Draw LIVE on SBS\n\nOn 6 December, Australia and 41 other nations will learn their group-stage fate at the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw in Washington DC, and you can watch it all live on SBS and SBS On Demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March, four other European teams will qualify, while six more teams will compete at the inter-confederation play-offs for the final two spots.\n\n\n\nWhich teams have already qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup?\n\nGood news, Australia has already qualified.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter beating Japan for the first time in 16 years and winning against Saudi Arabia in June, the Socceroos secured their World Cup place .\n\n\n\n\n\nAll nine teams from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) heading to the World Cup are already known.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran, Japan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Qatar, and Uzbekistan are the other teams that have qualified from the AFC. This is the first time Uzbekistan and Jordan have qualified for the world's biggest football tournament.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Canada, Mexico, and the US automatically made the tournament as hosts and skipped the qualification stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn South America, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay have qualified, and New Zealand will return to the World Cup following their last appearance in 2010 through Oceania.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Africa, nine teams have already qualified, with a special team making history.\n\n\n\n\n\nCape Verde, an island country in West Africa with a population of nearly 600,000, secured its spot in the World Cup last month. After Iceland, Cape Verde is the second smallest country by population to qualify for the tournament.\n\n\n\nEngland is so far the only European national team that has guaranteed a spot.\n\n\n\nWhich qualifying matches will be closely watched?\n\nWith teams playing 48 qualifying matches from 14 to 19 November, 14 more teams will qualify for the World Cup directly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the European qualification system, nations are split into six groups of four teams and six groups of five teams, with the winners of each group qualifying automatically for the final tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means some of the teams at the top of their group, such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, can possibly secure World Cup qualification in the coming days.\n\n\n\nOne of the matches worth keeping an eye on is the Germany and Slovakia fixture in Group A. Both teams are deadlocked at the top of the standings with nine points, and next week's match will determine who qualifies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the biggest one to watch will be the Group I clash between Italy and Norway. Norway is currently leading the table with 3 points more than Italy. If they beat Estonia and Italy fails to defeat Moldova, they will return to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if Italy beats its rival, the group will be decided in the final round of fixtures, when the two teams will play against each other on 17 November.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Austria will also qualify for their first World Cup since France 1998 if they beat Cyprus and Bosnia and Herzegovina fail to defeat Romania on 15 November.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso in November, the final round of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football will be played, and the three group winners will qualify directly to the World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuriname, Jamaica and Honduras are currently at the top of their groups, but standings could change quickly.\n\n\n\nNot entirely over for other teams\n\nThis won't be the end of the World Cup qualifiers excitement, as the fate of six more teams will be decided in March.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring that period, all 12 group runners-up in Europe will compete in the second round of qualifying. The four best winners from these matches will move forward to the World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nSix other non-European teams will also contest in March\u2019s inter-confederation play-offs, seeking their last chance to secure a spot in the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Liberal Party will remove a net zero target from our policy, and if elected, we will remove the 2030 target and its net zero by 2050 target from the Climate Change Act.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Opposition Leader Sussan Ley, announcing the Liberal Party's long-awaited position after a party room meeting in Canberra - and weeks of discussion over the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the vote wasn't a clean sweep.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the party room, 28 people came out swinging against the net zero target, including some senior members within opposition leader Sussan Ley's shadow cabinet like Michaelia Cash, James Patterson, Melissa McIntosh, Ted O'Brien and even Ms Ley's leadership rivals Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator McIntosh says dropping the target is the right thing for her constituents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This morning I went into the party room yesterday really strong in my conviction on behalf of my community when it comes to dropping net zero and it was never about anti climate or anti environment ..it was pro reality... and people in the suburbs... it's literally survival in the suburbs, they are dying under the Albanese government's mistargets when it comes to emission reduction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, senior moderates such as Andrew Bragg, Maria Kovacic, Angie Bell and Paul Scar were in favour of net zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Andrew Bragg told ABC's David Speers he'd leave the shadow cabinet if the commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 was ditched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, sure, but I don't imagine that we would ever leave Paris. I mean, we're a party of government, right? We're not a fringe party. We're not fringe dwellers. Most Australians want us to play our fair role in terms of emissions reduction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Wilson has also been vocal about his support for the 2050 target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We just end up being the national party lite, or we can define the future of the country. We can fight for hope and opportunity and building out and re-industrialising our country with the energy sources that we need. Setting a sovereign target for our emissoins and of course building out our clean industrial future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Australian senator Andrew McLachlan\n\n\n\nhas been asked what he would say to his colleagues who felt that dropping Net Zero was electorally advantageous.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr McLachlan, known as a vocal advocate for climate action, gave this response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're wrong. What more can I say? I try to argue the case. I don't think I'm alone in in the community, not only from a grassroots level, but also, for example, the National Farmers Federation, certain business councils. I mean, if you're going to argue that we're going to abandon Net Zero, you're going to be very alone in the community, and also the business community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo will Liberal frontbenchers like Andrew Bragg quit?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what does it mean for the party?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shadow ministry is maintaining its support for staying in the Paris Agreement, and wants to set Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are five-year targets that are not legally binding under the internationally enforceable commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition leader has also tasked energy spokesman Dan Tehan, moderate Anne Ruston and conservative Jonno Duniam to negotiate with the Nationals on a joint coalition position on net zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will enter discussions with Nationals senators Matt Canavan, Ross Cadell and Susan McDonald over coming days before a joint partyroom meeting on Sunday to rubber-stamp a policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal moderates have argued their chances of winning back vital inner-city electorates will be diminished as a result of scrapping their net zero commitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut frontbencher Alex Hawke disagrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've got no doubt a lot of people in the left, led by Labor and others, will make political claims about those sorts of things. The reality of net zero is the government has failed to put forward policies that will even achieve its own objectives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, teal independent MP Sophie Scamps has told Channel Nine's Today Show that the net zero debate shows the party has been influenced by Barnaby Joyce and Gina Rinehart for way too long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So they've been led around by the nose by the Nationals for way too long. And I think what we see now, if the Liberals really wanted, did want to have their own policies, then they should have stayed separate from the Nationals, but they didn't. They knew they've joined them. They're joining their policies, and they don't have their own, and they've showed, I think, a real lack of leadership on the biggest issue of our era, and have done so for decades now, and that's why we are seeing the demise of the Liberal party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOther independent MPs like Allegra Spender say the Liberals aren't just abandoning net zero but evidence-based policy thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie says the Liberal party's decision will \"let climate change rip.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says the Liberals' internal divisions are leaving Australians worse off.\n\n\n\n",

Our impression of wine varies according to what else is going on around us.\n\nBottle variation is a reality, but it\u2019s misnamed: it\u2019s actually cork variation since each one is different and, consequently, admits different volumes of air. This, of course, affects the way a wine develops over time. Also important is our own variation. Let\u2019s call it \u201coccasion variation\u201d, an expression I first heard used by Robin Day, the perceptive former chief winemaker at Orlando Wines in the Barossa. What he meant is that our impression of a wine varies according to what else is going on: what we\u2019re eating, the ambience of the space we\u2019re in, the company we\u2019re keeping and many other external influences.\n\nLet\u2019s start with ambience. This includes noise level, the smells emanating from the kitchen, the food on our plates, the scent of the person next to us at the table and whether we\u2019re sitting comfortably. Our palates also vary with our mood and health: whether we\u2019re feeling as fit as a Mallee bull or not quite 100 per cent; whether we\u2019re feeling happy or sad. And our dining companions. Who hasn\u2019t been at a table when somebody with a loud and confident voice raves about a wine and excites the entire group? Or the reverse: someone bad-mouths a wine, which causes everyone else to either dislike it or modify their opinion downwards? This sort of crowd opinion-influencing is very common. Even among professionals, sadly.\n\nIt has to be said, however, that the \u201986 Grange is a very good vintage.\n\nGot a drinks question for Huon Hooke? thefullbottle@goodweekend.com.au",

    "text": "But as shoppers hunt for bargains, the consumer watchdog is hunting for deceptive advertising \u2013 and scammers are hoping to exploit click-happy customers. Here\u2019s what you should know about Black Friday this year, and what to watch out for. Black Friday FOMO is real: Moving earlier can pay off Most retailers are now flogging deals well before November 28, earning the shopping phenomenon the nickname \u201cBlack November\u201d. \u201cThis year, the party has started even sooner. Amazon lit the fuse, launching its Prime Big Deal Days, and it was quickly followed by leading names like Myer, David Jones and Target - all before mid-October,\u201d said Shippit joint CEO Rob Hango-Zada.\n\nFor the month, luggage brand July\u2019s sales are 220 per cent higher than usual. \u201cWe wanted those cases, obviously, to last through Black Friday and the busy period, and we will be restocking, but not until December,\u201d said Pitman. Meanwhile, customer demands for lower prices, rapid delivery and seamless service are higher than ever, thanks in part to ultra-cheap ecommerce giants Shein and Temu\u2019s low prices and Amazon\u2019s same-day and next-day delivery times. Gen Z, in particular, have grown up with expectations of infinite choice on demand, and those who meet the expectations of this demographic \u2013 which will be the largest retail spenders by 2030 \u2013 will find success, Hango-Zada believes. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned that they can buy a $12 outfit at midnight and have it on their doorstep the next day delivered free of charge. The implication here is that they expect that same level of convenience everywhere else,\u201d said the ecommerce executive. \u201cOften, the difference between the retailers that are bustling and those that are struggling is the extent to which they understand - and meet the needs of - Gen Z shoppers.\u201d\n\nGeo-targeted ads: Promos are getting up close and personal July luggage made a point of sending more personalised, targeted ads to encourage customers to shop in-store instead of online. Why? People interact with the physical product, interact with store staff, encounter other items \u2013 like handbags or accessories \u2013 that they weren\u2019t planning to purchase. July encourages customers to shop in person, where people tend to buy more than they do online. \u201cWhat we see is a real opportunity to upsell customers,\u201d said Pitman.\n\nCustomers tend to spend more when they come into physical stores and can touch and feel the range of products, she confirmed. \u201cIt helps to see it in real life and test out if that bag sits on that suitcase well.\u201d Loading Meanwhile, some businesses have ditched sitewide sales to get customers to shop with them more than once through the sales season. For example, specialty sportswear store Pace Athletic has run daily November deals to keep customers coming back. \u201cMany brands have introduced early targeted offers and have been rotating these to encourage multiple purchase occasions,\u201d said Carla Penn-Kahn, the chief of ecommerce software platform ProfitPeak. \u201cThis is a smart strategy, by driving repeat purchases within a short period, brands can build customer lifetime value more quickly and make their customer acquisition costs more efficient.\u201d\n\nSmall businesses are under pressure \u2013 and opting out Markdowns are great news for consumers \u2013 but more than six in 10 small business owners report feeling pressured by the period of promotions driven predominantly by global and larger retailers. Just 39 per cent of 500 small business owners surveyed by Xero say they plan to hold Black Friday sales this year, down from 50 per cent last year, while 30 per cent say they can\u2019t afford to offer discounts. \u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller business, that discount is directly an impact on your bottom line, and you don\u2019t have the benefit of being a larger business with purchasing power,\u201d said Xero ANZ managing director Angad Soin. \u201cThere\u2019s a day-to-day cash flow reality that large businesses don\u2019t always have to feel, or don\u2019t always feel as acutely as small businesses do.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sitewide sale\u2019, \u2018everything 20% off\u2019: The ACCC is watching Loading Jewellery chain Michael Hill, Webjet, MyHouse, and Hairhouse Online were some of the businesses found afoul of the law in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s Black Friday blitz last year \u2013 and penalised for it. For example, Michael Hill held a \u201c25 per cent sitewide\u201d sale that actually excluded some products, while Webjet\u2019s advertised airfares \u201cfrom $18\u2033 that were actually three times as much by checkout after the addition of compulsory fees that were not disclosed. \u201cWe expect the ACCC to go a step further this year,\u201d said law firm Holding Redlich special counsel Emily Booth.\n\nSweeping \u201csitewide\u201d claims, was/now pricing that lacked genuine previous sale history, and \u201cup to X% per cent off\u201d claims that only apply to a selection of products will be in the ACCC\u2019s sights this year, Booth said. So will bait-and-switch tactics, like advertising pictures of clothing with a certain price tag, but finding that that item is not actually sold for the advertised price. \u201cConsumers prefer to know that everything is 20 per cent off rather than hunt through to find what is 40 per cent off.\u201d Most retailers are now flogging deals well before November 28, earning the shopping phenomenon the nickname \u201cBlack November\u201d. Credit: Simon Schluter If you spot a dodgy deal, the consumer cop on the beat is asking citizens to report them \u2013 and bring receipts. \u201cWe are putting retailers on notice,\u201d said ACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe, who said customers waiting for a Black Friday deal should make a note of prices now so they can check they\u2019re making a legitimate saving.\n\n\u201cConsumers shopping during the Black Friday sales are encouraged to report promotions or ads that raise concerns to the ACCC, including images of the potential misconduct.\u201d Scammers are lurking The shopping frenzy is fertile ground for scammers, who will fabricate fake websites, sponsored social media posts and ads to cloned websites that will collect your payment data. \u201cIn Australia, we\u2019re seeing a rise in scam emails (which began to peak around November 5) and social media ads impersonating major brands and even luxury retailers,\u201d said cybersecurity software Bitdefender security analyst Alina Bizga. Scammers will exploit shoppers\u2019 sense of urgency and trick them into acting quickly without verifying the deal\u2019s legitimacy. \u201cAustralians can also expect a wave of fake delivery notifications and smishing texts as November 28 approaches,\u201d said Bizga.",

    "text": "Loading The final designs, Hendry said, were finessed over a four-month-long exchange with her manufacturers, where they went through 35 \u201citerations and improvements\u201d. But the eleventh doll in JuJu\u2019s full line-up appears identical to what ChatGPT spat out after prompt 37. The plush toys will be sold in blind boxes from $US24 ($36). However, images created by AI are not considered copyrighted, unless the author significantly modifies it. When asked by a follower what significant modifications Hendry had made, she responded: \u201cJuJu is for the people, I reckon.\u201d One fan wrote on Instagram: \u201cYou\u2019re such a great artist. I\u2019m so disappointed to see you\u2019re using AI, the result is a subpar mishmash of things we already have.\u201d\n\nCan works created with AI be regarded as art at all? Sydney-based Australian multidisciplinary artist Timothy Johnston views generative AI as an extension of human expression. \u201cThe number of iterations that [Hendry] would have gone through, and prompts to learn \u2026 she\u2019s such a perfectionist, she\u2019s creating and creating, she\u2019s like a potter with clay, she\u2019s just not doing it by hand,\u201d he says. \u201cYou still have to have the vision and put in the time to master the AI.\u201d As Hendry noted on a video posted to Instagram: \u201cAI is like porn, it does a job, but it does not do the job!\u201d\n\nA representative for Hendry said the artist did not have time for an interview, a statement, or a response to this masthead\u2019s emailed questions. Live illustrator and art teacher Cat Long, who believes art generated wholly by AI \u2013 though she is not suggesting JuJu was \u2013 is, for now at least, very distinguishable from human creation. That\u2019s why she says the two aren\u2019t comparable. \u2018AI is like porn, it does a job, but it does not do the job!\u2019 CJ Hendry \u201cDoes AI take the soul out of art? Does it take the spark and creativity?\u201d Long wonders. \u201cThings created wholly by AI, there\u2019s probably a place for them, absolutely, in the art world \u2026 But I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re competing with art that\u2019s created for the soul.\u201d Not everyone agrees with that view.\n\nWhat it means for the artists if AI is using existing art Some commercial works are being created using already existing art and the artists are not being compensated. \u201cCreative work can now be produced by anyone without requiring the development of skills and expertise, but this is only made possible by existing creative work underpinning the process,\u201d warned federal arts body Creative Australia in a June submission to the Productivity Commission. \u201cThis work is often being used without consent or compensation, with significant potential impact on the financial viability of creative careers.\u201d Aboriginal artist Emma Hollingsworth, who sells art by the name Mulganai, says one of the reasons she wanted to bring her art to the world stage was so she could bring awareness to her people and her culture. Credit: Emma Hollingsworth/Mulganai\n\nIt\u2019s an impact felt keenly by some First Nations creatives artists, who refer to AI models training with and reproducing their art without consent as \u201cdouble colonisation\u201d. Kaanju, Kuku Ya\u2019u and Girramay digital artist Emma Hollingsworth, also known as Mulganai, simply calls it \u201ccreative theft\u201d. Loading \u201cMy art isn\u2019t just a pretty picture, it comes from my identity as an Aboriginal woman,\u201d says Hollingsworth. \u201cIt\u2019s tied to my family, ancestors, Country and stories. AI has none of that: no lived experience, no cultural memory, no spirit or connection to Country. It can imitate styles, but it cannot carry our culture or our history.\u201d In September, Hollingsworth found multiple replicas of her art being sold on Temu for $5 (the listings have since been taken down). Her art is a part of her, Hollingsworth says, but it also \u201ckeeps a roof over my head\u201d.\n\nContemporary artist Blak Douglas has also seen AI-generated images resembling his art floating around, but he\u2019s not concerned. Douglas, like Hendry, is a rebel \u2013 and his pop art-inspired portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens won him the Archibald Prize in 2022. The Dunghutti man calls generative AI the \u201cautotune of visual art\u201d, and sees it as an opportunity \u201cto reach the masses to tell them that Aboriginal art is different, modern, contemporary\u201d. Since he started painting 26 years ago, the Dunghutti man says, First Nations art has been governed by the dot paintings stereotype. \u201cIt\u2019s like this artistic analogy of keeping Aboriginal people within a mission,\u201d says Douglas. \u201cIt would be nice if the layperson Googled Aboriginal art, they might see Blak Douglas.\u201d Archibald Prize-winning modern contemporary artist Blak Douglas sees potential in generative AI to challenge people\u2019s perceptions about what Aboriginal art is. Credit: Louise Kennerley\n\nIs it \u2018autotune of visual art\u2019 or something more sinister? A through-line of Hendry\u2019s body of work is that, like Andy Warhol and Douglas, it disrupts the status quo and challenges what art is. Loading JuJu, Hendry says in an Instagram Story, is a commentary on how \u201cextraordinary and ridiculous\u201d the Labubu craze is. But long-time Hendry fan Ruby PH, a Sydney-based designer who admires Hendry\u2019s commercial success, doesn\u2019t see it. They say while it\u2019s important to engage with AI and not turn away from conversations surrounding it, they were disappointed that Hendry implied other toy makers commonly used generative AI.\n\nPH says, in their experience, people making toys have storytelling backgrounds, and develop 3D animation and illustration skills to bring their characters to life. Labubu, after all, was an original character created by artist Kasing Lung before Pop Mart made it a toy. \u201cIf you were trying to make a statement about hyper-consumerism \u2026 why just do the exact thing that it\u2019s doing? I don\u2019t see the parody in that,\u201d says PH, noting the final exhibit has yet to be unveiled. Where to now? Although Hendry has flirted with copyright infringement (she\u2019s given T-shirts away for free to avoid being sued) since picking up a pencil, there is no suggestion of wrongdoing. Hendry has also been transparent about her use of generative AI, which is one of Creative Australia\u2019s principles. Sydney-based designer Ruby PH says they admire Hendry for her commercial success and talent, but are disappointed with Hendry\u2019s use of generative AI in the initial stages of designing her JuJu exhibit. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nIn October, a proposed amendment to Australian copyright laws, which would have given tech firms carte blanche to train AI models on the work of local creatives, was quashed after a successful campaign fronted by artists including singer-songwriter Jack River (Holly Rankin). Loading This means that AI developers must seek permission before using creative works to train their models. Some visual artists, including Stephen Cornwell, are not taking any chances, using tools such as WebGlaze or Nightshade to protect their works from being scraped. Setting fair industry standards that protect creatives \u2013 such as the tech sector stepping up by remunerating, and seeking consent from, creatives to use their work \u2013 is critical to ensuring a future where both technology and culture can thrive, says Creative Australia\u2019s head of public affairs, Nicola Grayson. \u201cBeing able to use AI in a safe, ethical way is potentially quite exciting,\u201d says Grayson. \u201cIf we can work with the tech industry to really produce some great solutions, then the future will look bright.\u201d",

Any longer is unnecessary, says Cain. \u201cIn this instance, turn the lights on, use your phone on max brightness: All the things you wouldn\u2019t normally do,\u201d says Cain. \u201cIt will gradually push your body with evening light, towards London time.\u201d\n\nThis is because bright light in the morning pushes our body clock forward, while light in the evening pushes it back. Before a recent trip to London, Cain stayed up slightly later each night with bright lights on. Then, on the flight, he used light therapy glasses to keep himself awake until about 5am Australian time. \u201cI was most of the way adjusted by the time I got there,\u201d he says. When to avoid light Returning to Australia from Europe is trickier for our bodies.\n\nThe human clock tends to delay better than it advances, which is why people find it easier to travel west than east. This is compounded by the fact that we also often land in the morning when our bodies still think it is nighttime. Typical online advice is to get lots of bright light in our destination, especially if it\u2019s morning there. Following this advice can make the jet lag worse. \u201cIn the middle of the night, there is a crossover point on the effect of light. You quickly go from maximum delaying effect of light (like a slowing of the clock) to maximum advancing (like a speeding up),\u201d explains Cain. If we are exposed to light during this time, it can slow our clocks even further, or it can send the whole system into a state where it doesn\u2019t know what time it is, says Cain: \u201cWe refer to it as light hitting the singularity.\u201d The crossover point coincides with our core body temperature dropping to its lowest point, about 90 to 180 minutes before we normally wake up. So, for someone who typically rises at 6am, that will be somewhere between 3.30am and 4.30am.\n\nThis is the time when light is least likely to occur. When we\u2019re travelling, it can be a different story. For instance, if someone travels from Paris to Perth and lands at around 10am Perth time, that corresponds to 3am Paris time, when their core body temperature is at its lowest. Loading \u201cIf a blanket recommendation is followed, and you seek sunlight immediately after arrival, this light exposure will push the clock in the wrong direction, causing it to shift later instead of earlier,\u201d says Dr Dean Miller, a sleep and performance scientist at CQ University. \u201cIn effect, you\u2019ve turned a manageable seven-hour advance into a much harder 17-hour delay \u2013 prolonging jet lag and making recovery slower.\u201d The quickest route back to local time, says Miller, would require staying in relative darkness for the first couple of hours after landing until the body is out of the crossover period.\n\nBring on the sleep Like light, depending on how we time it, melatonin can help push our body towards the new time, or away from it, thereby prolonging our jet lag. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially timing information,\u201d says Cain. Specific and flexible timing information is what many apps and people offering advice get wrong, adds Cain. And if we can\u2019t follow that advice perfectly (if we have no control over the light we are exposed to, for instance), then the advice needs to adjust. \u201cThe advice is different depending on where you\u2019re coming from and where you\u2019re going, but even the time of day of your flight,\u201d says Cain. \u201cThere are so many moving parts, and you need to understand the underlying mechanisms to get it right.\u201d\n\nWithout this understanding, \u201cit\u2019s dumb at its core\u201d, says Cain, who is developing a jet lag app, which will use light sensors and adjust its advice based on the individual. With melatonin, taking it during the day when our body isn\u2019t naturally releasing it will shift the timing of our clock, just like light. \u201cIf you\u2019re travelling from west to east across six time zones, taking melatonin in the afternoon (in your body\u2019s time) is good because it\u2019ll advance your clock and that\u2019s what you need,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut if you took it in the late night or early morning, it delays your clock and can worsen jet lag.\u201d Eat your way to a new destination Food and exercise may not shift our central clock, but they also work to 24-hour rhythms and can help align our peripheral clocks, such as in the liver.\n\n\u201cLike light, food acts as a signal to our body to help set our circadian rhythms,\u201d explains Dr Charlotte Gupta, a researcher and chrono-nutritionist at the Appleton Institute. \u201cIf we eat at a time when our body isn\u2019t primed to be digesting food, like at night, this can contribute to misaligning our internal rhythms.\u201d Good jet lag advice considers what time your body thinks it is, as well as what time it is in your destination.

Gupta suggests eating (and exercising) in line with our light timing and sticking to light, unprocessed foods while our system adjusts. \u201cMeal timing on flights is not necessarily designed around the optimal eating timing.\u201d",

That's why our policy is about reducing emissions year on year on average,\" she told reporters in Sydney on Friday.\n\n\"(Emission targets are) not just a set and forget, because we should, in the interest of Australian families and communities, look at what the reality is on the ground and how much of that reality is changing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Liberals are still committed to the Paris climate agreement, a 2015 pact which requires countries to increase their action on emission reduction every five years.\n\nMs Ley said a different approach was needed with countries revising down their targets.\n\nThe opposition leader said the policy would focus on reducing energy bills for households and have a range of energy forms in the mix.\n\nMore gas is needed to supply Australia's energy grid, the coalition says. (Marion Rae/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nWhile she indicated more gas was needed for supply to the grid, she did not say how that would be achieved.\n\n\"Our energy mix, more broadly, is technology agnostic, so we want to use every opportunity that can be brought to bear to bring prices down to deliver a stable, reliable grid,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"There are ways of injecting more gas into the system, and that supply is critical.\"\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen says the coalition is avoiding action on climate. (Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen said climate deniers had won the battle over policy within the coalition.\n\n\"What we saw yesterday was a blaming of contradictory, internally inconsistent statements and claims, all an alibi to avoid action on the greatest environmental challenge and economic opportunity of our time,\" he told ABC Radio.\n\nOpposition energy spokesman Dan Tehan, who will be among the negotiators with the Nationals, said cheaper power bills was the priority of the policy.\n\n\"We are very, very confident that by bringing all of Australia's natural resources to this equation, that we will be able to put downward pressure on energy,\" he told ABC Radio.\n\nEnergy spokesman Dan Tehan says the Liberals' plan will be guided by a market-based approach. (Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"We're going back to an approach where the market will determine the types of technologies and the pathways, and that is the traditional liberal approach to addressing these types of issues.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Liberal policy also reiterates support for removing a moratorium on nuclear energy in Australia.\n\nThe coalition took a proposal to May's federal election of building multiple nuclear power plants to expand the mix of the energy grid.\n\n\"Nuclear does make sense, by the way. We're going to have nuclear-powered submarines in this country,\" Ms Ley told Nine's Today program.",
