    "text": "Less than a year into her reign, the federal Liberal Party's first-ever female leader is sitting on death row.\n\nFor the second time in mere months, Opposition Leader Sussan Ley is commanding only a tattered, single-party Coalition.\n\nSussan Ley is once again under enormous pressure as Liberal leader. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\n\"She was aware of the consequences if she (accepted the resignations of three senators), that the National Party were being forced into an untenable position,\" he said.\n\n\"She still made that decision.\"\n\nLittleproud and his senators who voted against the government's hate speech legislation also knew the consequences \u2013 cabinet solidarity is a fundamental principle within the Coalition agreement.\n\nMake 9News your preferred source of breaking news and exclusives on Google by clicking the image above. (Nine)\n\nBut you won't hear that retort coming from Ley anytime soon, as the opposition leader opts to avoid speaking on the national day of mourning for the Bondi terror attack .\n\n\"That is honourable and noble and in the right spirit of a day of mourning,\" 9News political editor Charles Croucher said.\n\n\"But it's also leaving a lot of airtime to be filled by others, and they will be those who are against her.\n\n\"That could be the final death knell for her in that leadership position.\"\n\nLey's stint as Liberal leader began with a similar schism, but that was repaired in relatively quick time .\n\nThis one appears far less salvageable \u2013 the only cure that could bring the two parties back together is Ley's removal.\n\nDavid Littleproud has walked the Nationals away from the Coalition - again. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\n\"We cannot be part of a shadow ministry under Sussan Ley,\" Littleproud said.\n\nIt leaves the Liberal Party with two options: find a new leader, or continue as the opposition on its own, with fewer than 40 lower house MPs to counter the government's 94.\n\n\"It is a mess. That is the only word for it,\" Croucher said.\n\n\"It's a mess that's going claim at least one scalp at some point in the coming weeks, because clearly David Littleproud and Sussan Ley can't work together.\"\n\nIt's those numbers in parliament that made Ley's decision to accept the resignations of the three Nationals senators who broke shadow cabinet solidarity so risky.\n\n\"You're flexing muscles you don't have,\" Croucher said.\n\n\"There is no room to be this boisterous and stand up to the Nationals, because this is the consequence: the Coalition is split, the opposition looks feeble, and the government's getting a free ride to start 2026.\"\n\nLey won't hold a press conference today due to the national day of mourning for the Bondi terror attack victims. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nMaking matters worse for the now-extinct Coalition is the fact this asteroid was entirely self-inflicted.\n\nThe opposition insisted parliament be urgently recalled to pass legislation following the Bondi shooting, only to rupture over the lack of time they had to examine those laws.\n\n\"The Coalition demanded parliament comes back \u2013 parliament comes back,\" Croucher said\n\n\"The Coalition demands that parliament splits the bill \u2013 the government splits the bill.\n\n\"And still, they've split Coalition on this\u2026",

    "text": "The mother of a backpacker found dead and mauled by dingoes on the Queensland island of K'gari wants her daughter to be remembered as a free-spirited girl who spent two summers fighting bushfires in her native Canada.\n\nPiper James, 19, had gone for an early-morning swim before her body was found surrounded by a pack of about 10 dingoes on a beach on the tourist island on Monday. \ufeff\n\nSpeaking to 9News from their family home on Vancouver Island, Piper's mum Angela James said her daughter was \"having the time of her life\" in Australia.\n\nPiper spent two summers fighting bushfires in British Columbia before travelling to Australia. (Nine)\n\n\"She loved it there. She just loved it. She thought it was beautiful,\" Angela said.\n\nPiper would often phone her parents early in the morning from the beach on K'gari.\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\"She quite often would set her alarm to get up, catch the sunrise, which is what she did that day,\" Angela said.\n\n\"I think that's what she probably got up to do. But she never got the opportunity to.\"\n\nPiper James' parents have paid tribute to their teenage daughter after her shock death. (Nine)\n\nAngela wants her daughter to be remembered as the girl who rode dirt bikes and spent two summers fighting wildfires in British Columbia to save money to see the world.\n\n\"They had done an adventure tour in K'gari and just thought it was just amazing, and fell in love with the people there that worked there, and they just clicked. And they offered the girls a job,\" Angela said.\n\nPiper had spent the last six weeks working as a housekeeper at a backpacker campsite with her hometown friend Taylor Stricker.\ufeff\n\nThe campsite was merely a few hundred metres from the beach where her body was found.\ufeff\n\n\"It's just a tragic accident, it's tragic. I don't know, maybe something needs to be done to keep people a little safer, that's all,\" Angela said.\n\nPiper's body was found surrounded by dingoes on a K'gari beach. (Nine)\n\nPiper travelled to K'gari with her best friend Taylor Stricker. (Nine)\n\n\ufeffPiper's father, Todd James, said the family was shattered and in pain over her death.\n\n\"We will always remember her infectious laugh and her kind spirit,\" he wrote in a post on social media this morning.\n\n\"So many are going to miss you, my precious little baby girl.\n\n\"May be gone, but how can we ever forget you?\"\ufeff\n\nJames added that he had supported her to travel to Australia and loved hearing about the bonds and friendships she was developing.\n\n\"I admired her strength and determination to go after her dreams,\" he said.\n\n\"She was glad I was on board for her trip to Australia. Lol, she said, 'Because I'm 18, and you can't stop me!'\ufeff\n\n\"Piper would work hard so she could play hard.\"\ufeff\ufeff\n\nPiper James and her dad Todd James. (Facebook)\n\nPiper James had been working on K'gari for the past six weeks. (Facebook)\n\nHer body, found covered in bites and scratches, was due to undergo an autopsy on mainland Queensland today.\n\n\"There's going to be an autopsy, and it's important that that be made public, and there's a considered response to that,\" Premier David Crisafulli said.\n\nThe examination is hoped to provide answers as to whether she died from drowning or being mauled by dingoes.\n\nThe potential that dingoes could be responsible has stunned locals and tourists alike.\n\nThe last fatal dingo attack on K'gari was \ufeff25 years ago, when a nine-year-old boy was killed in 2001.\n\nSince then, Indigenous elders claim they've repeatedly warned the state government that dingoes, known as \"wongaris\" to the Aboriginal community, are growing more dangerous as tourism takes over.\n\n\"We asked them to close camping grounds down, they don't do anything. So yes I do believe we could've made a difference,\" Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation's Christine Royan said.\n\nK'gari has a permanent population of about 150 people, and about 400,000 tourists visit every year.\n\nButchulla Aboriginal Corporation's Christine Royan said more could have been done to prevent the tragedy. (Nine)\n\nEach car needs a paid permit and there is limited accommodation in towns and camping zones, but there is no official cap on visitor numbers.\n\n\"We're going to fight anybody that wants to actually remove the wongaris from K'gari. What we need to do is look at better management of K'gari,\" Royan said.\n\n\"The premier, I don't even think you've had a visit on K'gari. About time you come over and listen to the real issues.\"\n\nCrisafulli said he had been to K'gari \"many times\", but has not visited since he became premier.\ufeff\n\nPolice said the incident has been traumatising to Piper's friend, the two men who found her, officers and the wider community.\n\nPeople have been warned to stay away from dingoes.\n\n\"Dingoes are wild animals, and whilst they are very culturally, and significant to the local First Nations people and to the people that live on the island, they are still wild animals and need to be treated as such,\" Wide Bay District Inspector Paul Algie said on Monday. \ufeff",

So their attendance at past and future March for Australia rallies would be one of those,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sure at some point in the future they will launch a new organisation, and they'll tone down the national socialism of it and focus on something that is perhaps more palatable or certainly less likely to fall foul of various hate legislation.\"",

    "text": "Australia's unemployment rate fell from 4.3 to 4.1 per cent in December, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\nThe figure comes less than two weeks before the Reserve Bank of Australia's next interest rates meeting, where the board will factor in economic indicators, including the jobs market.\n\nMost economists have been predicting no increase to interest rates, but some inflation hawks say the bank should jack up rates because the economy is running at or near its capacity \u2014 an argument bolstered by the stronger-than-expected jobs data.\n\nThe chief economist at KPMG, Brendan Rynne, said the figures were \"quite significantly stronger\" than expected.\n\n\"[This latest jobs data] does show a much stronger labour market than any of us had anticipated,\" Dr Rynne said.\n\nEmployed people were up 65,000 in December, with both full-time (55,000 people) and part-time (10,000 people) employment contributing to this rise.\n\nThe participation rate, which measures the share of people either working or actively looking for work, rose to 66.7 per cent.\n\nYounger workers moving into the workforce helped push down Australia's unemployment rate to 4.1 per cent annually in December. (AAP: Bianca De Marchi)\n\nThe ABS's head of labour statistics, Sean Crick, said the unemployment rate was pushed down in part by a rise in younger people entering the workforce.\n\n\"This month we saw more 15 to 24-year-olds moving into employment, contributing to the rise in overall employment and the fall in the unemployment rate,\" he said.\n\nThe growth in employment was driven by male employment, which rose by 49,000 people, while female employment recorded a smaller increase of 17,000 people, he added.\n\n'Jobs market digging in its heels'\n\nOxford Economics Australia's head of economic research, Harry Murphy Cruise, said he had expected unemployment to rise, but \"the jobs market is digging in its heels\".\n\n\"Absent our forecast rise in unemployment, an interest rate hike may be needed to tame the resurgence of inflation,\" he said.\n\n\" We won't jump on one data point, but the odds of a rate hike are rising. Next week's inflation data will be the deciding factor. \"\n\nBloomberg data shows that before the jobs data was released, most economists forecast no change to interest rates when the Reserve Bank monetary policy board meets on February 3, with futures markets putting the chance of a hike to 3.85 per cent at just a 25 per cent chance.\n\nHowever, some economists \u2014 and the market \u2014 expect rates to rise later in the year, with the futures market pricing in an increase to 4 per cent by November.\n\nThe chance of a hike at the next meeting jumped to 53.8 per cent after the jobs figures were released, Reuters data shows.\n\nThe RBA's next rates call is on February 3. (AAP: James Ross and Joel Carrett)\n\nOnly a handful of economists expect rates to be cut.\n\nIn a report released on Thursday morning before the jobs result, Deloitte Access Economics partner Stephen Smith said the economy was too weak to handle a rate increase and predicted the next move in rates would be downward.\n\nHowever, he said it would be a \"line ball\" decision for the RBA in February, with the monetary policy board on high alert after declines in inflation reversed in figures released in September and October.\n\n\"In Deloitte Access Economics' view, an increase in the cash rate in February would be premature for several reasons,\" he said.\n\nHe said it was not possible to be confident that the Australian economy was growing as fast as it could, which was \"the current fashion among some forecasters to justify a rate hike\".\n\n\"Add in recent changes to the way trimmed mean inflation is calculated, the complex effect of electricity rebates, and the messiness of the post-pandemic economic recovery, and the causes of the recent lift in inflation become even less clear,\" he said.\n\n\"Deloitte Access Economics remains of the view that a dispassionate and considered RBA will stay on hold in February, though the December inflation data \u2014 which will be released after this document goes to press \u2014 will be an important piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nJob ads down\n\nJob ad data released by Seek also pointed towards economic weakness, with positions on offer falling 3.5 per cent over 2025.\n\nNational job ads fell 1.2 per cent in December, which Seek's senior economist, Blair Chapman, said was slightly steeper than the usual seasonal drop before the Christmas and New Year break.\n\n\"January traditionally brings renewed momentum into the employment market, as businesses re-emerge from holiday mode,\" Dr Chapman said.\n\n\"Whether the rebound in January is enough to see job ads trending up again will soon be seen.\"",

    "text": "It says a lot about the presence of youth in professional tennis that two players in their mid to late-20s can already be considered veterans on the tour.\n\nBut that is how Alex de Minaur and Frances Tiafoe described each other ahead of Friday's enticing third-round clash at the Australian Open.\n\nAustralian Open: day five blog The second round of the Australian Open singles continues with Novak Djokovic hunting his 101st win at Melbourne Park.\n\nDe Minaur, the world number six, overcame a shaky start and rain delay on Rod Laver Arena to defeat Serbian Hamad Medjedovic 6-7, (5-7), 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 on Wednesday evening.\n\nWhile de Minaur was wrapping up victory, 29th seed Tiafoe was putting the finishing touches to his 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 defeat of Argentina's Francisco Comesa\u00f1a on Margaret Court Arena.\n\nDe Minaur, who at 26 is one year younger than Tiafoe, holds a 3-1 advantage over the American in their career head-to-head meetings.\n\nThe last time they faced each other, the Australian enjoyed a three-set victory in a round-of-16 match at the Toronto Masters 1000 event in August.\n\nFrances Tiafoe (left) lost to Alex de Minaur in Toronto last year. (Getty Images: Matthew Stockman)\n\nTiafoe, who reached a career-high ranking of 10 in 2023, has enormous respect for de Minaur, noting they are both among the most experienced players in the men's draw at Melbourne Park.\n\n\"I've known him [de Minaur] for a while, known him for a long time,\" Tiafoe told reporters.\n\n\"Him and me, we've played since we came on the scene. Got in the top 100, kind of around the same time.\n\n\"I've seen him around for years, and now we're the older guys on the tour, and now we're playing big matches against each other.\"\n\nAlex de Minaur needed four sets to get past Hamad Medjedovic. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\nSpeaking just prior to Tiafoe clinching his win over Comesa\u00f1a, de Minaur was full of praise for the world number 34.\n\n\"Frances, he's super dangerous. He's playing well, got a lot of firepower,\" de Minaur said.\n\n\"He's a veteran. We've had some battles in the past. I wouldn't expect anything other than an absolute battle against him.\n\n\"He seems to be locked in.\"\n\n'I'm going to come for him'\n\nTiafoe will be a tricky opponent for de Minaur, who made the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park last year.\n\nNicknamed \"Big Foe\", the US Davis Cup player has appeared in the second week of a major on several occasions, so he is accustomed to playing on the big stage.\n\nFrances Tiafoe has previously reached the quarterfinals in Melbourne. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\nTiafoe reached the quarterfinals at the Australian and French Opens \u2014 in 2019 and 2025 respectively \u2014 while he has twice got as far as the semis (2022 and 2024) at his home major.\n\n\"It's earlier for both of us than we would like, but I'm happy to play against him,\" Tiafoe said.\n\n\"It's going to be fun, against all these fans. I love playing on the big courts, and now is where the event really gets going.\"\n\nTiafoe appears quietly confident of his chances on Friday, with the match expected to be scheduled for the blockbuster evening session on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nAnd while Tiafoe stopped short of making a prediction about the result, he was sure it would be a must-watch encounter.\n\n\"He's going to come for me, I'm going to come for him,\" Tiafoe said.\n\n\"Tennis fans are going to get their money's worth.\"",

It was more that it was going to be a sad, lonely life.\n\n\"That definitely weighed on me pretty heavily.\"\n\nHumphries, who plays for the Adelaide 36ers and came out in 2022, said Ogilvy's decision was another big step forward for the LGBTQA+ community in Australian sport.\n\nIsaac Humphries of the Adelaide 36ers came out in 2022.

By November, roughly half were informed they would no longer receive wages.\n\nIts holding company, Liberty Primary Metals Australia (LPMA), was placed in administration in November.\n\nThe administrator says selling Tahmoor is central to unlocking value for creditors.\n\n\"Now the DOCA [Deed of Company Agreement] has been approved, one of the main questions we have at the moment is realising assets within the group,\" joint administrator Michael Brereton of William Buck said.\n\n\"One of those is the holding company that owns 100 per cent of the shares in Tahmoor Coal.\"\n\nExpressions of interest are open as administrators seek a path to restart the Tahmoor Colliery. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez)\n\nMr Brereton said administrators had seen strong and sustained interest in the mine, even before the formal process began.\n\n\"Even at the point we were initially appointed, we were getting significant interest from parties in Tahmoor Coal itself,\" he said.\n\n\"We previously disclosed we received six expressions of interest before Christmas, and since then we've been approached by additional parties.\"\n\nThree-week process\n\nThe process for expressions of interest opened this week and runs until 11 February.\n\nMr Brereton said the aim was both to maximise value and to restart the mine as quickly as possible.\n\n\"The purpose of the expressions-of-interest process is to maximise value,\" he said.\n\n\"In addition to that, we are hopeful of seeing the mine restarted \u2014 that is in the interests of all parties.\"\n\nThe mine is understood to be valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe process to attract investors for Tahmoor Coal is now officially underway.

(Facebook: Weldborough Hotel)\n\nAnd with the webpage lacking directions, excited travellers have descended on the area's other famous landmark \u2014 the Weldborough Hotel, about two hours' drive north-east of Launceston \u2014 to ask how they can find the idyllic pools.\n\nThe problem is, the hot springs, as depicted in the imagery, do not exist.\n\nA confused publican and confused guests\n\nIt is a problem that publican Kristy Probert encountered regularly.\n\n\"The Weld River, which runs through Weldborough, is freezing cold, it's definitely, definitely not a hot spring,\" she said.\n\n\" They're more likely to find a sapphire than \u2026 to find a hot spring, to be honest. \"\n\nMs Probert said she was getting daily phone calls and in-person visitors asking about the hot springs, some even wanting to book accommodation.\n\n\"I actually had a group of 24 drivers turn up there two days ago that were on a trip from the mainland, and they'd actually taken a detour to come to the hot springs,\" Ms Probert said.\n\n\" I said, 'If you find the hot springs, come back and let me know and I'll shout you beers all night' \u2014 they didn't come back. \"\n\nThe location is listed on the website alongside the very real Hastings Caves and Thermal Springs in southern Tasmania, along with some more questionable inclusions, such as freezing Liaweenee and remote Savage River.\n\nVisitors will not find a scene like this at Savage River.

(Tasmania Tours)\n\nHe said the company had outsourced marketing material to a third party, which used AI to create some of its content.\n\nMr Hennessy said that while all posts were normally reviewed before being posted, some had been made public by mistake while he was out of the country.\n\nThe hot springs article was posted in July 2025.\n\n\"We're trying to compete with the big boys, and part of that is you've got to keep your content refreshed and new all of the time,\" Mr Hennessy said.\n\nThe Museum of Old and New Art, also known as MONA, features a range of rock faces, but none like this. (Tasmania Tours)\n\n'Three-legged wombat, crocodile-looking things'\n\nMr Hennessy said the use of AI content was necessary in order to compete for prominence in online searches and win over customers.\n\n\"We don't have enough horsepower to write enough content on our own, and that's why we outsource part of this function,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes it's perfect and really good and does what you hope it would do, and sometimes it gets it completely wrong.\n\n\"I've seen it create animals I've never seen before \u2014 three-legged wombat, crocodile-looking things.\"\n\nThis image is clearly not Launceston, despite the city having multiple bridge crossings of the Tamar River. (Tasmania Tours)\n\nMr Hennessy said all the AI-generated blog posts had been taken down and were being checked thoroughly.\n\nHe assured anyone looking to book through Tasmania Tours that it was, in fact, a real website, selling real tours.\n\n\"We're not a scam, we're a married couple trying to do the right thing by people \u2026 we are legit, we are real people, we employ sales staff,\" Mr Hennessy said.\n\nAI resulting in traveller mistakes\n\nDestination Southern Tasmania's Anne Hardy said serious attention needed to be paid to \"AI hallucinations\", with use of the technology becoming more prevalent.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"What we know is that now about 90 per cent of itineraries that are generated by ChatGPT actually have at least one error in them, and we also know that 37 per cent of people rely on AI to generate their itineraries,\" Professor Hardy said.\n\nCommon mistakes can include opening times, inaccurate descriptions of what is offered at a location, how long a walk may be, or what equipment is needed.\n\nShe said the phony hot springs website was a \"very good lesson in terms of quality control\".\n\n\"That's the problem with the internet and selling online \u2026 now businesses need to always keep ahead of the curve and they need to be easily found when people put in searches and that type of thing,\" Professor Hardy said.",

(Supplied: The Port of Townsville)\n\n\"We are already the fastest-growing cruise market in the country, and the Great Barrier Reef Aquarium is the major drawcard long term for those cruise ships to come here,\" TEL chief executive Claudia Brumme said.\n\n\"It will mean we are going from 22 ships a year to 30 to 40 ships a year.\n\n\"It will be the world's largest living coral reef aquarium, and it gives us a competitive edge.\"",

(ABC TV)\n\nThe deal comes after EnergyAustralia announced its proposal in November to convert the Yallourn coal power site into a $5 billion low-carbon emissions hub to support similar data centres.\n\nA booming industry\n\nData centre demand is booming.\n\nAn estimated 4,000 data centres are currently in operation around the globe, with Australia ranking in the top-five locations.\n\nSimon Wilson says the the race is on to get data centres built.

Got it Share A A A\n\nA quick-thinking pilot instructor\u2019s decision to use a golf course as an emergency runway after a light plane\u2019s engine failed about 1600 feet above Sydney\u2019s northern beaches helped avoid a worse crash, an investigation has found. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau\u2019s (ATSB) probe of the light plane crash on a Mona Vale golf club fairway on August 17, 2025, when a student pilot sustained minor injuries, found that an exhaust valve caused an engine failure. Loading The valve broke away from its stem in the third cylinder of the 1967 Piper Cherokee\u2019s engine, causing extensive damage, the investigation concluded. The cause of the exhaust valve failure could not be determined, but the engine\u2019s manufacturer had previously provided advice about the risks of engine oil contamination causing valves to stick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plane took off for a navigation training flight from Wollongong with the student pilot and instructor on board. But during the flight, the engine\u2019s RPM began to drop rapidly as unusual noises began to be heard. A plane made an emergency landing on Mona Vale Golf Course in August. Nine News About six minutes later, while trying to reach Long Reef golf course and with the engine progressively decreasing in power, the instructor decided to land at Mona Vale golf course instead. Long Reef had fewer trees, but Mona Vale was closer, and the engine RPM was progressively decreasing, according to the ATSB report. \u201cThis investigation highlights the importance of effective decision-making skills in emergency situations,\u201d ATSB chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious ATSB investigations had highlighted how delaying a decision to land after an engine malfunction can lead to more challenging landings. The bureau said the instructor\u2019s timely decision to land sooner probably minimised the adverse consequences of the forced landing. The aircraft was substantially damaged while those on board sustained minor injuries. Nine News But during the final stages of the approach, the pilot realised the plane would not be able to safely land straight ahead and made a right turn to avoid facilities, dropping the right wing and causing the plane to land heavily. It came to a stop before the clubhouse on the 15th hole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe landing caused substantial damage to the plane, while the student pilot sustained minor injuries. The leased plane\u2019s operator, Airspeed Aviation, has reviewed its processes and is consulting with other industry participants to create guidance on using aircraft with older engines in response to the crash, the ATSB reported.

Byrne clearly tried to process some of those feelings on last year\u2019s Who Is the Sky? album, so here he continues the exercise, with some of those songs joining the tried-and-true favourites from his brilliant career.\n\nLoveliness abounds at a David Byrne show. We know this from our extraordinary shared experience in this same room in 2018 but, you know, some stuff has happened since then.\n\nThanks to his exquisite use of screens and lights, we spend time on the moon, looking down at Earth (for the maudlin but warm Heaven); in neon-hued streets to a seamy funk soundtrack of Houses in Motion; at the (hardly hellish, unsurprisingly stylish) abode where Byrne was stuck during lockdown (the jaunty folly of My Apartment Is My Friend); and more cleverly realised locales.\n\nDavid Byrne with a few members of the 12-strong band. Pete Dovgan\n\nThere\u2019s other visual trickery, and sometimes the gimmicks supersede the songs (and distract you from the lesser ones; hello, Independence Day) \u2013 but more often than not the aesthetics emphatically enhance them.\n\nThis includes the band, a riveting, dozen-strong collective roaming the stage along with Byrne in perfectly choreographed harmony, variously playing their assigned instruments and/or dancing with infectious joy. We join them on our feet, of course, especially for the Talking Heads classics: the meticulously, blissfully building This Must Be the Place; the ever-dizzying perfection of Once in a Lifetime; the cathartic euphoria of Burning Down the House.\n\nAt the risk of being That Guy, this tour is not quite as spectacular as the flawless 2018 show \u2013 a version of which you can see in Spike Lee\u2019s 2020 concert film American Utopia \u2013 though that\u2019s an opinion largely based on my feelings on the likeable but merely fine songs of Who Is the Sky? ousting others I\u2019d rather see and hear. But a David Byrne performance is still quite like nothing else out there, in most of the very best ways.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe owners of the Queen Victoria Building have scrapped a controversial plan to replace the building\u2019s multicoloured glass windows with clear panes after a public backlash. In December, Vicinity Centres \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest retail landlord and co-owner of the QVB \u2013 lodged a development application with the City of Sydney seeking to replace the multicoloured glass on the Market Street ground-floor shopfronts with clear glass. The application to replace these stained-glass windows outside Market Street with clear glass has been abandoned. Louie Douvis The move sparked anger in the community over concerns it would damage the heritage character of the iconic building if the application was approved by the council\u2019s planning panel. However, on Wednesday night, the retail giant quietly withdrew its development application before the exhibition period, accepting public submissions were slated to end on February 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have listened carefully to community sentiment and recognise the strong connection many people have to this treasured icon and the importance placed on its historic character,\u201d a Vicinity spokesperson told the Herald. \u201cAs responsible custodians, we take that feedback seriously and remain committed to preserving the QVB\u2019s heritage. This decision reflects Vicinity\u2019s commitment to act proactively, decisively, and respectfully in the best interests of the QVB and the broader community. \u201cWe have withdrawn the application to ensure the QVB continues to be celebrated, protected and enjoyed for generations to come.\u201d The stained-glass windows Vicinity sought to replace in its application were refurbished in the 1980s, a reconstruction of the original neo-romanesque sandstone building that was erected in 1898.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtists who, decades ago, cut by hand thousands of pieces of glass for the refurbishment said the push to alter the building greatly saddened them. Related Article Exclusive\n\nCity life Rozlyn hand-cut 73,000 pieces of glass for the QVB. Now the landlord wants some removed Before backflipping, Vicinity Centres said in its proposal that the coloured glass created a \u201csignificant economic burden\u201d to landlords and reduced the attractiveness and value of the space to prospective retailers, pointing to millions of dollars in lost revenue. It also argued that the coloured glass obscured views from the street, and that installing clear glass would provide clearer views into shops and highlight their double-height spaces. The City of Sydney\u2019s planning portal has since been updated, and progress timelines on their website show the development application has been withdrawn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLord Mayor Clover Moore welcomed the reversal, and said she was glad the owners had listened: \u201cThis is one of our most important, treasured heritage buildings. As the city around it changes, it remains as a bold and significant piece of public infrastructure and an important layer of both our architectural history and cultural fabric.\u201d Deputy Lord Mayor Jess Miller said it was a \u201creal win for the planning process\u201d and for the community. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we take good care of these gorgeous heritage buildings, and this is a really exciting outcome,\u201d Miller said. Vicinity Centres acquired the QVB in 2018 and co-owns the building with Link REIT. They also own a raft of other shopping centres across the country, from Chatswood Chase and The Strand Arcade in Sydney, to Chadstone and the Emporium in Melbourne.

Got it Share A A A\n\nPop juggernaut Taylor Swift has once again been pulled into the legal battle between It Ends With Us co-stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. Text messages between long-time friends Swift and Lively were unsealed on Tuesday (US time) amid the ongoing legal drama, which began in December 2024 when Lively filed a complaint against her co-star and director, accusing him of sexual harassment and running a smear campaign against her. Baldoni categorically denied all accusations against him. The trial is set for May. Private text messages between friends Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have been revealed amid Lively\u2019s legal battle with Justin Baldoni. PA Wire/Getty In May 2025, Swift was subpoenaed as a witness in Baldoni\u2019s $US400 million defamation countersuit \u2013 which has since been dropped \u2013 against Lively. A spokesperson for Swift said at the time this was designed to generate public interest by \u201ccreating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case\u201d. Though the subpoena was dropped later that month, Swift\u2019s name has emerged again amid the legal mayhem. According to the unsealed messages, seen by this masthead, Lively spoke openly about the concerns she had while on set for the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s It Ends With Us. At one point, the actress referred to Baldoni as her \u201cdoofus director\u201d. In December 2024, the close friends texted again shortly before the publication of a New York Times expose regarding Lively\u2019s accusations against Baldoni and the film\u2019s production company Wayfarer Studios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Taylor Swift Why is Taylor Swift caught up in the Baldoni-Lively legal battle? \u201cI think this bitch knows something is coming because he\u2019s gotten out his tiny violin,\u201d Swift texted Lively alongside a screenshot of a People article about Baldoni saying he\u2019d been \u201csexually traumatised\u201d. Swift later described the situation as \u201ca horror film no one knows is taking place\u201d and said Baldoni \u201cneeds to be beaten by his OWN words\u201d. In the same conversation, Lively wrote to Swift: \u201cCan you imagine feeling as confident as these predators that you\u2019re going to always get away with it. Him accepting an award as an ally for women ... And Scooter going about [the] world with his head held high as he co-owns and funds a crisis PR company that silences women.\u201d Scooter Braun, who was subpoenaed by Lively, was in a long-running feud with Swift over the ownership of her music. An earlier exchange in April 2023 appeared to show Lively asking Swift to praise Lively\u2019s revised version of the script for It Ends With Us in front of Baldoni. Swift was allegedly on her way to meet the director at Lively\u2019s New York apartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a clown and thinks he\u2019s a writer now,\u201d Lively wrote. \u201cSo having the greatest living storyteller unknowingly echo to him how much you love what we\u2019re doing (giving him credit as if he wrote them with me) will go such a long way.\u201d According to the filing, Swift responded, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything for you!!\u201d Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have been close friends since 2015.

The S&P/ASX 200 was 65 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher to 8847.9, with nine of 11 industry sectors in positive territory. The increase followed a rally on Wall Street overnight, after Trump dumped his threat to impose tariffs on several European countries because of their opposition to the US taking control of Greenland, saying he had a \u201cframework for a future deal\u201d on arctic security. Wall Street rallied on the latest developments in the stoush over Greenland. Bloomberg Labour force figures were released at 11.30am AEDT, showing that the economy added 65,200 jobs in December, pushing the jobless rate to 4.1 per cent, down from 4.3 per cent in November. AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina said the implied odds of a rise in official interest rates in February had lifted from 26 per cent to 56 per cent after the figures were published.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial stocks rose at the open then received a further boost from the jobs figures, with Commonwealth Bank (up 1.6 per cent), Westpac (up 1.1 per cent), National Australia Bank (up 2.6 per cent) and ANZ Bank (up 0.6 per cent) sharply higher in early afternoon trade. Among the miners, Rio Tinto added 1.1 per cent and BHP shed 0.5 per cent. Fortescue fell 4.4 per cent after it announced it shipped a record volume of iron ore in the six months to December 31. Gold miners retreated, with Northern Star falling 2.1 per cent and Evolution Mining 0.8 per cent lower. Energy stocks are higher as oil prices strengthened as traders assessed US President Donald Trump\u2019s statement that the US had reached a \u201cframework\u201d for a deal on Greenland. Woodside Energy rose 2.7 per cent, while Santos added 4.1 per cent as it lifted fourth-quarter production by 5 per cent. Related Article Opinion\n\nWorld markets Melting down: Trump sent a warning by markets Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rallied 1.2 per cent after Trump said the deal, \u201cif consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America\u201d and its allies in the North Atlantic region. The announcement triggered an immediate move higher in the stock market, which found solace earlier in the day after Trump ratcheted down his rhetoric and told business and government leaders in Europe that he would not use force to take \u201cthe piece of ice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe de-escalation in tensions helped the S&P 500 recover just over half of its 2.1 per cent drop from the day before and pull closer to its all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 588 points, or 1.2 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2 per cent. The Australian sharemarket is set to advance, with futures pointing to a gain of 47 points, or 0.5 per cent, at the open. The ASX shed 0.4 per cent on Wednesday. The Australian dollar is trading at US67.64\u00a2 at 8.45am AEDT. Treasury yields also eased in the bond market in another signal of reduced worries among investors. Besides the progress on Greenland, they also got help from a calming of yields in Japan\u2019s jumpy bond market. The value of the US dollar, meanwhile, clawed back some of its declines against other currencies after sliding the day before. Trump himself acknowledged how the US stock market sold off on Tuesday because of his desire for Greenland, but he called it \u201cpeanuts compared to what it\u2019s gone up\u201d in the first year of his second term and said it would go up further in the future. Trump has a history of making big threats that send financial markets sliding, only to pull back later and reach deals that are seen as less bad for the economy or for inflation than his initial suggestion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn one hand, the pattern has given rise to the \u201cTACO\u201d acronym suggesting \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d if financial markets react strongly enough. On the other, Trump has ultimately struck deals that outsiders may have earlier considered unlikely, ones that he\u2019s crowed about later. The most obvious example is Trump\u2019s announcement of high tariffs on \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d which eventually led to trade deals with many of the world\u2019s major economies. Helping to lead the US stock market Wednesday was Halliburton. The oil field services company rose 4.1 per cent after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. United Airlines climbed 2.2 per cent after likewise reporting a better profit for the final three months of 2025 than analysts expected. CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline\u2019s strong momentum in revenue is continuing into 2026. They helped offset a 2.2 per cent drop for Netflix. The streamer sank even though it reported a stronger profit than expected. Investors focused instead on its slowing subscriber growth and its lower-than-expected forecast for profit in the current quarter. Kraft Heinz sank 5.7 per cent after Berkshire Hathaway warned investors that it may be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the food giant that former CEO Warren Buffett helped create in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerkshire took a $US3.76 billion ($5.6 billion) write-down on its Kraft-Heinz stake last summer. Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz\u2019 plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire\u2019s two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring. All told, the S&P 500 rose 78.76 points to 6,875.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 588.64 to 49,077.23, and the Nasdaq composite gained 270.50 to 23,224.82. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.25 per cent from 4.30 per cent late Tuesday. That\u2019s almost all the way back to the 4.24 per cent level where it was at on Friday. Related Article Updated\n\nTrump diplomacy Trump retreats on Greenland threats, dropping tariffs and ruling out force as future deal agreed That was before Trump threatened to impose 10 per cent tariffs on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland for opposing US control of Greenland. That would have been on top of a 15 per cent tariff specified by a trade agreement with the European Union that has yet to be ratified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in mostly modest movements across Europe and Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 per cent. The country\u2019s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, has called a snap election for Feb. 8, which had sent yields of long-term government bonds to record levels and raised worries across global financial markets. The expectation is that Takaichi, who is capitalizing on strong public support ratings, will cut taxes and boost spending and increase the government\u2019s already heavy load of debt. After surging as high as 4.22 per cent on Tuesday, the yield on the 40-year Japanese government bond pulled back to 4.05 per cent Wednesday.

Develop it and improve it and make it so that it's good for Europe and safe for Europe and good for us. And that's the reason I'm seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States.\"\n\nThe President has long said the US will get control of Greenland, no matter what it takes.\n\nAt Davos, Mr Trump has taken the same tone.\n\n\"They have a choice. You can say yes. And we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no. And we will remember.\"\n\nBut the President says he has ruled out the use of force in order to get his way.\n\n\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won't do that. Okay? Now everyone's saying, oh, good. That's probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. But I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force.\"\n\nMr Trump also took a wider hectoring tone in his remarks.\n\nHe's chastised the US' European allies for what he has called their insolence, disloyalty and policy missteps in areas ranging from immigration and geopolitics, to the environment and wind power.\n\n\"There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I've noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing.\u201d\n\nOn several occasions during his speech, President Trump also mistakenly referred to Greenland as Iceland.\n\n\"I don't know that they'd NATO be there for us. They're not there for us on Iceland. That I can tell you. The stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland's already cost us a lot of money.\"\n\nReactions to Trump's complaints about Greenland - and the wider European continent - have been swift.\n\nCroatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 says he's relieved military action appears to have been ruled out.\n\n\"What was clear, that if the offer is not accepted, he will not be happy, but he will not use force. So, in a way, this calms down the whole tension that was a little bit visible over the past few days.\"\n\nBut Donald Trump's increasing bluster towards Europe over Greenland has continued to fray transatlantic ties and worry Europeans.\n\nDonald Trump had earlier threatened tariffs on Denmark and any other close European allies that sent troops to Greenland in solidarity, including Britain, France and Germany.\n\nThe European Parliament Chair of the International Trade Committee, Bernd Lange says this would have been a breach of a crucial trade deal.\n\n\"It's totally clear that there was a breaking of the Scotland deal by President Trump, announcing 10 per cent tariff for European goods starting at the 1st of February and 25 per cent if Greenland is not going to the United States in June.\"\n\nSome European allies, like Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch, believe Mr Trump has been trying to bully them into doing what the U-S wanted.\n\n\"Let's just say in many ways I'm not surprised at all. This follows the line of both a mix of irrational and rational arguments at the same time.\"\n\nDonald Trump's threats at Davos have even appeared on the verge of rupturing NATO, which was founded by leading European nations, the US and Canada in the aftermath of World War Two.\n\nAmid these concerns, British Defence Secretary John Healey has said Europe must play a key role going forward.\n\n\"Recognising the growing threats from Russia, recognising the growing interest from China, and recognising the way that the High North will open up increasingly with climate change and increasingly become an area of competition in which we, through NATO, with the U.S. playing a part, will reinforce the security and the deterrents for the future.\"\n\nUltimately, President Trump cancelled the planned Greenland-related tariff.\n\nHe says this is because an agreement has been reached with NATO on a framework for a future Arctic deal, though what that looks like remains to be seen.\n\n\"The deal is going to be put out pretty soon. We'll see. It's right now a little bit in practice, but pretty far along. It gets us everything we needed to get.\"\n\nEven so, the concern amongst some European allies isn't going away.\n\nBernd Lange says Trump's speech made it clear his Greenland ambitions remained unchanged.\n\n\"Some of you listened also to the speech of President Trump in Davos, and I guess he didn't revise his position. No, he wants to have Greenland as part of the United States as quick as possible, and he wants to have a table where we could discuss about the price.\"\n\nSerbian President, Aleksandar Vucic, is among those who suggest more conflict is ahead, no matter what happens with Greenland.\n\n\"I am not as smart as all the other politicians in the world to assess it immediately after he delivered his speech, but obviously, we'll be facing bigger tensions between Europe and United States in the time to come, and we'll have to get ready for that.\"",

    "text": "Gen X households hold more wealth in property and shares than other generations, but baby boomers still have the highest net worth overall, according to a new analysis.\n\nBaby boomers (born 1946-1964) had the highest average net worth at $2.375 million, with gen X (born 1965-1980) close behind at nearly $2.2 million, according to the report by consultancy firm KPMG, which analysed Australian Bureau of Statistics income and wealth data.\n\nThe net worth gap between these generations has kept narrowing, according to KPMG, which a year ago said gen X had overtaken boomers for the first time on property wealth and shares.\n\nBoth cohorts were significantly wealthier than millennials (born 1981 to 1996), whose average net worth was $905,000, according to the latest analysis.\n\nYoung homeowners who could get a foothold during the years of ultra-low interest rates have seen their wealth surge, while those who couldn't are at risk of being permanently priced out of the market.\n\nThe average household wealth for Australians aged 25 to 34 rose from $340,000 in 2019\u201320 to $550,000 in 2024\u201325 \u2014 an increase of 63 per cent.\n\nKPMG urban economist Terry Rawnsley said the increased wealth of younger Australians was largely driven by those who purchased property when interest rates were \"ultra-low\" in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\"For young Australians able to get into the market they are starting to see strong growth, but for those aged under 30, many of whom have been locked out of housing, wealth accumulation will be a much tougher task,\" Rawnsley said.\n\n\"With interest rates now at much higher levels, that home ownership window is now firmly closed.\"\n\nSource: SBS News / KPMG\n\nHowever, younger Australians will likely retire with far more superannuation than those exiting the workforce today, according to the analysis.\n\nThe 55 to 64 age group had super balances averaging $756,000, compared to $151,000 for 25 to 34-year-olds and $289,000 for 35 to 44-year-olds.\n\nWith decades left of their working lives, younger generations will benefit from higher mandatory employer contributions, which will be invested for longer.\n\n\"Their superannuation will be coming off a far higher base than their parents. This means the wealth they will eventually accumulate from super will be far higher than today\u2019s retirees,\" Rawnsley said.\n\nThe amount you need for a comfortable retirement can vary widely, however, depending on whether you own your home, according to some models.\n\n'The great wealth transfer is in full swing'\n\nThe report \u2014 which also analysed household wealth by generation \u2014 found baby boomers had the highest net worth overall, while gen X had the most property wealth.\n\nGen X households had an average property wealth of $1.445 million, compared to $1.360 million for baby boomers.\n\nSource: SBS News / KPMG\n\nRawnsley attributed the shift to an inter-generational wealth transfer.\n\nIn 2024, analysts estimated Australia's over-60s are expected to transfer $3.5 trillion to younger generations in the next 20 years, dubbing this the 'great wealth transfer'.\n\n\"The great wealth transfer is in full swing, as baby boomers start downsizing properties and moving that wealth into cash. They are also beefing up their super accounts as they begin to spend in retirement or hand down wealth to their children,\" he said.\n\n\"This has meant gen X is atop the mantel as the wealthiest property owners.\"\n\nMillenials had larger debts than other generations, likely owing to property loans.\n\n\"For the average millennial household, the property they own is still largely a liability, which explains why their net worth is less than the average value of their property,\" Rawnsley said.\n\nLucas Walsh, professor of youth studies at Monash University, told SBS News the wealth transfer came at the expense of Australians who did not expect an inheritance.\n\n\"More goes to wealthier families and less goes to others,\" he said.\n\n\"This divide is striking ... and I think will present problems to social cohesion, as people become less happy with their lives under these conditions.\"\n\nWalsh said the wealth transfer would continue, but he expected it to narrow.\n\n\"We can expect the wealth accumulated by previous generations to have less and less relative value if property prices keep going up and the cost of living keeps increasing,\" he said.\n\nProperty remains primary driver of wealth\n\nThe report shows home ownership remains the cornerstone of wealth accumulation, which includes property, superannuation, shares and other assets minus debts.\n\nHouseholds aged 55 to 64 had the highest average property wealth at $1.529 million, while those aged 25 to 34 averaged $575,000.\n\n\"This wealth profile is reflecting a lifetime of super contributions and exposure to the share market and purchasing homes when they were more affordable,\" the report states.\n\nSource: SBS News / KPMG\n\n\"Many young people in this group are just entering the housing market, which leaves them with large mortgages,\" Rawnsley said.\n\n\"Combined with HECS debts, this makes them the most leveraged generation with an average loan size of $346,000, offsetting total assets of $899,000.\"\n\nWith many young people priced out of the housing market, Rawnsley said he expected many would focus on building their share portfolios as a way of accumulating wealth.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\u201cWell, Marie Bashir was just a unique human being incredibly compassionate. She was able to project her warmth and compassion and wisdom out into the world. She certainly was able to focus it on people that she was with, but she was able to project it out into into the wider world and that was a gift and she was a tremendous role model.\u201d\n\nThis is professor Patrick McGorry, former Australian of the year, and CEO of Orygen Youth Mental Health, speaking about New South Wales' first female governor Dame Marie ((mah-ree)) Bashir, who has died aged 95.\n\nNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns announced Dame Marie's passing in a statement over night, which in part reads:\n\n\u201cDame Marie was an extraordinary Australian and one of New South Wales\u2019 most respected public servants. On behalf of the people of New South Wales, I extend my deepest condolences to Dame Marie\u2019s family, friends and all those who were inspired by her remarkable life. Dame Marie Bashir served our state with distinction as the first female Governor of NSW from 2001 to 2014, bringing to the role immense dignity and compassion.\u201d\n\nDame Marie was married to former lord mayor of Sydney, Sir Nicholas Shehadie for 61 years, and had three children and six grandchildren.\n\nPrior to her appointment as governor in 2001, she had became known for her pioneering work and passionate advocacy across areas such as suicide prevention, youth mental health and Indigenous health.\n\nShe was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia in 1988 for her services to child and adolescent health.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has joined others in paying tribute to her life and legacy, writing on social media:\n\n\u201cHer lifetime of service to the medical profession, her community and her fellow Australians was defined by her powerful sense of duty and her abiding passion for helping others. As the first woman to serve as Governor of New South Wales she was both a pioneer and an inspiration. In all she did, Dame Marie blended dignity with warmth and intellect with empathy. \u201c\n\nDame Marie was born in the Riverina town of Narrandera to a Lebanese father and a mother of Lebanese descent.\n\nShe graduated from the University of Sydney in 1956 with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery, and worked in hospitals and as a general practitioner, before completing post-graduate studies in Psychiatry.\n\nIn 2010 in an interview for NITV's Living Black program, she reflected on her time working as nurses aide during the holidays at Prince Alfred Hospital.\n\n\u201cSo I got the feel of patients in bed, very ill. My job was to clean pans and to feed those who'd had strokes and nothing to do with being a medical student or a future doctor. It was a wonderful experience because close up I was able to see suffering when people were alone.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGorry, who later knew Dame Marie personally as a fellow psychiatrist, says a commitment to equality was an undercurrent through all her work.\n\n\u201cShe was someone who just treated every human being and so every human being is as equal and a vehicle value and obviously she worked with multicultural youth. She worked with indigenous use marginalise use and she was an incredibly inclusive. You know almost like a spiritual person I would say.\u201d\n\nAmong other roles, Dame Marie worked as a senior consultant at the Aboriginal Medical Service in both Redfern and Kempsey.\n\nIn a partnership with the Redfern Aboriginal Medical Service, she established the Aboriginal Mental Health Unit, which provides regular clinics and counselling at both the Aboriginal Medical Service in Sydney and mainstream centres.\n\nShe was a vocal advocate for Indigenous rights more broadly, too.\n\nHere's Dame Marie speaking to NITV in 2013 about the significance of the National Apology to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\n\u201cAs on that wonderful day when the prime minister annunciated those unforgettable words on behalf of the nation of sorry, the whole nation rose, I believe, in stature. And I think when Aboriginal people are formerly recognized in the Constitution, that will be another landmark occasion.\u201d\n\nDame Marie is also being honoured today for her support for the LGBTQI+ community, which included her and her husband being named chiefs at the 2015 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras for their work to combat homophobia.\n\nShe retired as Governor in 2014, after holding the office for over 13 years, making her the second-longest serving Governor of New South Wales\n\nProfessor McGorry says she leaves behind a powerful legacy built on unity and compassion.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we're getting with seeing more more division along these sorts of fault lines in our society emerging right now and so someone like Marie was the antidote. She was the absolute opposite of what we're seeing at the moment with within society, trends that are emerging so she was a unifier, she was an integrator and she was a spiritual leader really.\u201d\n\nA state funeral will be held for Dame Marie at a later date.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nA quick-thinking pilot instructor\u2019s decision to use a golf course as an emergency runway after a light plane\u2019s engine failed about 1600 feet above Sydney\u2019s northern beaches helped avoid a worse crash, an investigation has found. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau\u2019s (ATSB) probe of the light plane crash on a Mona Vale golf club fairway on August 17, 2025, when a student pilot sustained minor injuries, found that an exhaust valve caused an engine failure. Loading The valve broke away from its stem in the third cylinder of the 1967 Piper Cherokee\u2019s engine, causing extensive damage, the investigation concluded. The cause of the exhaust valve failure could not be determined, but the engine\u2019s manufacturer had previously provided advice about the risks of engine oil contamination causing valves to stick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plane took off for a navigation training flight from Wollongong with the student pilot and instructor on board. But during the flight, the engine\u2019s RPM began to drop rapidly as unusual noises began to be heard. A plane made an emergency landing on Mona Vale Golf Course in August. Nine News About six minutes later, while trying to reach Long Reef golf course and with the engine progressively decreasing in power, the instructor decided to land at Mona Vale golf course instead. Long Reef had fewer trees, but Mona Vale was closer, and the engine RPM was progressively decreasing, according to the ATSB report. \u201cThis investigation highlights the importance of effective decision-making skills in emergency situations,\u201d ATSB chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious ATSB investigations had highlighted how delaying a decision to land after an engine malfunction can lead to more challenging landings. The bureau said the instructor\u2019s timely decision to land sooner probably minimised the adverse consequences of the forced landing. The aircraft was substantially damaged while those on board sustained minor injuries. Nine News But during the final stages of the approach, the pilot realised the plane would not be able to safely land straight ahead and made a right turn to avoid facilities, dropping the right wing and causing the plane to land heavily. It came to a stop before the clubhouse on the 15th hole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe landing caused substantial damage to the plane, while the student pilot sustained minor injuries. The leased plane\u2019s operator, Airspeed Aviation, has reviewed its processes and is consulting with other industry participants to create guidance on using aircraft with older engines in response to the crash, the ATSB reported.

Byrne clearly tried to process some of those feelings on last year\u2019s Who Is the Sky? album, so here he continues the exercise, with some of those songs joining the tried-and-true favourites from his brilliant career.\n\nLoveliness abounds at a David Byrne show. We know this from our extraordinary shared experience in this same room in 2018 but, you know, some stuff has happened since then.\n\nThanks to his exquisite use of screens and lights, we spend time on the moon, looking down at Earth (for the maudlin but warm Heaven); in neon-hued streets to a seamy funk soundtrack of Houses in Motion; at the (hardly hellish, unsurprisingly stylish) abode where Byrne was stuck during lockdown (the jaunty folly of My Apartment Is My Friend); and more cleverly realised locales.\n\nDavid Byrne with a few members of the 12-strong band. Pete Dovgan\n\nThere\u2019s other visual trickery, and sometimes the gimmicks supersede the songs (and distract you from the lesser ones; hello, Independence Day) \u2013 but more often than not the aesthetics emphatically enhance them.\n\nThis includes the band, a riveting, dozen-strong collective roaming the stage along with Byrne in perfectly choreographed harmony, variously playing their assigned instruments and/or dancing with infectious joy. We join them on our feet, of course, especially for the Talking Heads classics: the meticulously, blissfully building This Must Be the Place; the ever-dizzying perfection of Once in a Lifetime; the cathartic euphoria of Burning Down the House.\n\nAt the risk of being That Guy, this tour is not quite as spectacular as the flawless 2018 show \u2013 a version of which you can see in Spike Lee\u2019s 2020 concert film American Utopia \u2013 though that\u2019s an opinion largely based on my feelings on the likeable but merely fine songs of Who Is the Sky? ousting others I\u2019d rather see and hear. But a David Byrne performance is still quite like nothing else out there, in most of the very best ways.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe owners of the Queen Victoria Building have scrapped a controversial plan to replace the building\u2019s multicoloured glass windows with clear panes after a public backlash. In December, Vicinity Centres \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest retail landlord and co-owner of the QVB \u2013 lodged a development application with the City of Sydney seeking to replace the multicoloured glass on the Market Street ground-floor shopfronts with clear glass. The application to replace these stained-glass windows outside Market Street with clear glass has been abandoned. Louie Douvis The move sparked anger in the community over concerns it would damage the heritage character of the iconic building if the application was approved by the council\u2019s planning panel. However, on Wednesday night, the retail giant quietly withdrew its development application before the exhibition period, accepting public submissions were slated to end on February 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have listened carefully to community sentiment and recognise the strong connection many people have to this treasured icon and the importance placed on its historic character,\u201d a Vicinity spokesperson told the Herald. \u201cAs responsible custodians, we take that feedback seriously and remain committed to preserving the QVB\u2019s heritage. This decision reflects Vicinity\u2019s commitment to act proactively, decisively, and respectfully in the best interests of the QVB and the broader community. \u201cWe have withdrawn the application to ensure the QVB continues to be celebrated, protected and enjoyed for generations to come.\u201d The stained-glass windows Vicinity sought to replace in its application were refurbished in the 1980s, a reconstruction of the original neo-romanesque sandstone building that was erected in 1898.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtists who, decades ago, cut by hand thousands of pieces of glass for the refurbishment said the push to alter the building greatly saddened them. Related Article Exclusive\n\nCity life Rozlyn hand-cut 73,000 pieces of glass for the QVB. Now the landlord wants some removed Before backflipping, Vicinity Centres said in its proposal that the coloured glass created a \u201csignificant economic burden\u201d to landlords and reduced the attractiveness and value of the space to prospective retailers, pointing to millions of dollars in lost revenue. It also argued that the coloured glass obscured views from the street, and that installing clear glass would provide clearer views into shops and highlight their double-height spaces. The City of Sydney\u2019s planning portal has since been updated, and progress timelines on their website show the development application has been withdrawn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLord Mayor Clover Moore welcomed the reversal, and said she was glad the owners had listened: \u201cThis is one of our most important, treasured heritage buildings. As the city around it changes, it remains as a bold and significant piece of public infrastructure and an important layer of both our architectural history and cultural fabric.\u201d Deputy Lord Mayor Jess Miller said it was a \u201creal win for the planning process\u201d and for the community. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we take good care of these gorgeous heritage buildings, and this is a really exciting outcome,\u201d Miller said. Vicinity Centres acquired the QVB in 2018 and co-owns the building with Link REIT. They also own a raft of other shopping centres across the country, from Chatswood Chase and The Strand Arcade in Sydney, to Chadstone and the Emporium in Melbourne.

Text messages between long-time friends Swift and Lively were unsealed on Tuesday (US time) amid the ongoing legal drama, which began in December 2024 when Lively filed a complaint against her co-star and director, accusing him of sexual harassment and running a smear campaign against her. Baldoni categorically denied all accusations against him. The trial is set for May. Private text messages between friends Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have been revealed amid Lively\u2019s legal battle with Justin Baldoni. PA Wire/Getty In May 2025, Swift was subpoenaed as a witness in Baldoni\u2019s $US400 million defamation countersuit \u2013 which has since been dropped \u2013 against Lively. A spokesperson for Swift said at the time this was designed to generate public interest by \u201ccreating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case\u201d. Though the subpoena was dropped later that month, Swift\u2019s name has emerged again amid the legal mayhem. According to the unsealed messages, seen by this masthead, Lively spoke openly about the concerns she had while on set for the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s It Ends With Us. At one point, the actress referred to Baldoni as her \u201cdoofus director\u201d. In December 2024, the close friends texted again shortly before the publication of a New York Times expose regarding Lively\u2019s accusations against Baldoni and the film\u2019s production company Wayfarer Studios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Taylor Swift Why is Taylor Swift caught up in the Baldoni-Lively legal battle? \u201cI think this bitch knows something is coming because he\u2019s gotten out his tiny violin,\u201d Swift texted Lively alongside a screenshot of a People article about Baldoni saying he\u2019d been \u201csexually traumatised\u201d. Swift later described the situation as \u201ca horror film no one knows is taking place\u201d and said Baldoni \u201cneeds to be beaten by his OWN words\u201d. In the same conversation, Lively wrote to Swift: \u201cCan you imagine feeling as confident as these predators that you\u2019re going to always get away with it. Him accepting an award as an ally for women ... And Scooter going about [the] world with his head held high as he co-owns and funds a crisis PR company that silences women.\u201d Scooter Braun, who was subpoenaed by Lively, was in a long-running feud with Swift over the ownership of her music. An earlier exchange in April 2023 appeared to show Lively asking Swift to praise Lively\u2019s revised version of the script for It Ends With Us in front of Baldoni.

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe Australian sharemarket has shed some of its early gains after unexpectedly strong jobs figures increased the chances of an interest rate hike next month, while investors responded favourably to an easing in tensions over President Donald Trump\u2019s push to take control of Greenland. The S&P/ASX 200 was 65 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher to 8847.9, with nine of 11 industry sectors in positive territory. The increase followed a rally on Wall Street overnight, after Trump dumped his threat to impose tariffs on several European countries because of their opposition to the US taking control of Greenland, saying he had a \u201cframework for a future deal\u201d on arctic security. Wall Street rallied on the latest developments in the stoush over Greenland. Bloomberg Labour force figures were released at 11.30am AEDT, showing that the economy added 65,200 jobs in December, pushing the jobless rate to 4.1 per cent, down from 4.3 per cent in November. AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina said the implied odds of a rise in official interest rates in February had lifted from 26 per cent to 56 per cent after the figures were published.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial stocks rose at the open then received a further boost from the jobs figures, with Commonwealth Bank (up 1.6 per cent), Westpac (up 1.1 per cent), National Australia Bank (up 2.6 per cent) and ANZ Bank (up 0.6 per cent) sharply higher in early afternoon trade. Among the miners, Rio Tinto added 1.1 per cent and BHP shed 0.5 per cent. Fortescue fell 4.4 per cent after it announced it shipped a record volume of iron ore in the six months to December 31. Gold miners retreated, with Northern Star falling 2.1 per cent and Evolution Mining 0.8 per cent lower. Energy stocks are higher as oil prices strengthened as traders assessed US President Donald Trump\u2019s statement that the US had reached a \u201cframework\u201d for a deal on Greenland. Woodside Energy rose 2.7 per cent, while Santos added 4.1 per cent as it lifted fourth-quarter production by 5 per cent. Related Article Opinion\n\nWorld markets Melting down: Trump sent a warning by markets Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rallied 1.2 per cent after Trump said the deal, \u201cif consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America\u201d and its allies in the North Atlantic region. The announcement triggered an immediate move higher in the stock market, which found solace earlier in the day after Trump ratcheted down his rhetoric and told business and government leaders in Europe that he would not use force to take \u201cthe piece of ice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe de-escalation in tensions helped the S&P 500 recover just over half of its 2.1 per cent drop from the day before and pull closer to its all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 588 points, or 1.2 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2 per cent. The Australian sharemarket is set to advance, with futures pointing to a gain of 47 points, or 0.5 per cent, at the open. The ASX shed 0.4 per cent on Wednesday. The Australian dollar is trading at US67.64\u00a2 at 8.45am AEDT. Treasury yields also eased in the bond market in another signal of reduced worries among investors. Besides the progress on Greenland, they also got help from a calming of yields in Japan\u2019s jumpy bond market. The value of the US dollar, meanwhile, clawed back some of its declines against other currencies after sliding the day before. Trump himself acknowledged how the US stock market sold off on Tuesday because of his desire for Greenland, but he called it \u201cpeanuts compared to what it\u2019s gone up\u201d in the first year of his second term and said it would go up further in the future. Trump has a history of making big threats that send financial markets sliding, only to pull back later and reach deals that are seen as less bad for the economy or for inflation than his initial suggestion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn one hand, the pattern has given rise to the \u201cTACO\u201d acronym suggesting \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d if financial markets react strongly enough. On the other, Trump has ultimately struck deals that outsiders may have earlier considered unlikely, ones that he\u2019s crowed about later. The most obvious example is Trump\u2019s announcement of high tariffs on \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d which eventually led to trade deals with many of the world\u2019s major economies. Helping to lead the US stock market Wednesday was Halliburton. The oil field services company rose 4.1 per cent after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. United Airlines climbed 2.2 per cent after likewise reporting a better profit for the final three months of 2025 than analysts expected. CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline\u2019s strong momentum in revenue is continuing into 2026. They helped offset a 2.2 per cent drop for Netflix. The streamer sank even though it reported a stronger profit than expected. Investors focused instead on its slowing subscriber growth and its lower-than-expected forecast for profit in the current quarter. Kraft Heinz sank 5.7 per cent after Berkshire Hathaway warned investors that it may be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the food giant that former CEO Warren Buffett helped create in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerkshire took a $US3.76 billion ($5.6 billion) write-down on its Kraft-Heinz stake last summer. Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz\u2019 plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire\u2019s two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring. All told, the S&P 500 rose 78.76 points to 6,875.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 588.64 to 49,077.23, and the Nasdaq composite gained 270.50 to 23,224.82. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.25 per cent from 4.30 per cent late Tuesday. That\u2019s almost all the way back to the 4.24 per cent level where it was at on Friday. Related Article Updated\n\nTrump diplomacy Trump retreats on Greenland threats, dropping tariffs and ruling out force as future deal agreed That was before Trump threatened to impose 10 per cent tariffs on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland for opposing US control of Greenland. That would have been on top of a 15 per cent tariff specified by a trade agreement with the European Union that has yet to be ratified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in mostly modest movements across Europe and Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 per cent. The country\u2019s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, has called a snap election for Feb. 8, which had sent yields of long-term government bonds to record levels and raised worries across global financial markets. The expectation is that Takaichi, who is capitalizing on strong public support ratings, will cut taxes and boost spending and increase the government\u2019s already heavy load of debt. After surging as high as 4.22 per cent on Tuesday, the yield on the 40-year Japanese government bond pulled back to 4.05 per cent Wednesday.
