    "text": "A Melbourne mother-of-two says her six-month-old daughter is suffering from cracked, crusting and bleeding skin due to withdrawal from topical steroids prescribed to treat eczema.\ufeff\n\nNikki Estrada took her baby daughter, Xenrea, then four months old, to hospital after she became dehydrated due to low milk supply.\ufeff\n\nWhile they were there, \ufeffdoctors noticed a red patch on Xenrea's cheek and prescribed five days of antibiotics and 14 days of topical steroid cream as well as bleach baths as a \"precaution\" in case the skin had become infected.\n\nBaby Xenrea pictured when doctors first diagnosed her eczema (left) and after ceasing topical steroid treatment after 14 days (right). (Supplied)\n\n\"\ufeffI thought it was a normal baby skin rash, I didn't suspect it was eczema,\" Estrada said. \ufeff\n\n\"My gut instinct was like, this is wrong, she doesn't need it... but you just think, I'm gonna listen to the doctors.\n\n\"And it worked, the little patch on her cheek, it was gone.\"\n\nBut two days after finishing the prescribed topical steroid cream treatment, she said \ufeffher daughter's symptoms worsened.\n\n\"As soon as I stopped, it just came back with a vengeance,\" Estrada said.\n\n\"It's broken, it's open, it's weeping, she doesn't sleep.\n\n\"I can't sleep because I need to hold her so she doesn't scratch.\n\n\"Her mouth cracks and bleeds from trying to eat.\"\n\nDesperate and distressed, Estrada took Xenrea to the GP and a paediatrician, who both recommended she resume the topical steroids until the symptoms cleared.\n\nBy that time, she had begun researching topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) online and had found similar cases in online support groups.\n\nXenrea's symptoms dramatically worsened after completing the prescribed 14 days of topical steroid creams. (Supplied)\n\nTSW is characterised by red, burning and itchy skin\ufeff, that sometimes presents after ceasing prolonged or high-potency steroid treatment.\n\n\"Speaking to other mothers, it sounded like she was going through a withdrawal, because, you know, I only applied (steroid cream) to her face, but it was everywhere on her body, which was identical to other parents and their kids,\" she said.\n\n\"First, it becomes really, really red and hot and burning, and then the body will ooze, the skin barrier breaks, and then it scabs, and because it's so dry it bleeds and it's prone to infection, and it's just a cycle until the new skin comes back up.\"\n\nEstrada is now seeing a naturopath and says her daughter's skin is slowly improving with the use of natural creams\ufeff, and prebiotic and probiotics for her gut health.\ufeff\n\n\"It's just been so heartbreaking seeing my daughter in so much pain and she's only six months old,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel like I've still got months until her skin's gonna go back to how it was.\"\n\nAccording to Professor Deshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist at The Skin Hospital in Sydney\ufeff, side effects from the use of steroid creams are rare.\n\n\"When used for skin conditions which come and go like eczema, where you are only applying them for a few days then taking a break, side effects are vanishingly rare,\" Sebaratnam said.\n\n\"When patients stop using their steroids, their underlying skin disease can flare back up, and sometimes this can be confused by people as dependency or addiction \u2013 which it isn't.\n\n\"Patients need to also consider the effects of not controlling their eczema \u2013 itch, pain, increased risk of infection, sleep disturbance, cost, the impact on the whole family et cetera.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Backpacker killer Bradley John Murdoch takes deadly secret to his grave\n\nProfessor Deshan Sebaratnam said topical steroid creams are safe when used under the direction of a doctor, and side effects are rare. (Supplied)\n\nEczema is often worse in winter, due to low humidity, long hot showers, and irritation caused by people wearing extra layers, heating and electric blankets.\n\nMelody Livingstone, CEO of Australian skincare company MooGoo, said sales of \ufefftheir eczema and psoriasis creams had doubled this winter, compared to last year.\n\n\"Australia has one of the highest incidences of eczema in the world, and it is only getting worse \u2013 50 years ago, only one in 10 Australian children suffered from it,\" she said.\n\nEczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic, debilitating disease that affects 2.8 million Australians, including one in three Aussie kids under the age of six.\n\nManagement includes\ufeff keeping the skin moisturised and avoiding triggers such as soap, fragranced washing detergents, prickly fabrics, and heat.\n\nTopical steroid creams, when used under the supervision of a doctor, are widely considered by doctors and specialists to be a safe treatment for flare-ups.\n\nPlease note the information in this story is general in nature.

(Getty)\n\n\"You can see a pathway to building your wealth in a more incremental way rather than having to stump up with a very sizable deposit.\"\n\nThis month marks 30 years since Commonwealth Bank's \ufeffonline share trading platform CommSec launched in Australia and the economic landscape \ufeffhas undoubtedly changed enormously since 1995.\n\nIn the mid-'90s, \ufeffCommSec trades were done slowly by telephone and fax for $75 each and most investors were older, wealthier Australians.\n\nNow, \ufeffPiotrowski said, young people with various incomes are now using their smartphones to trade shares at lunch time hoping to build their \"nest egg\".\ufeff\n\nCommSec data released last year found 2.9 million investors under the age of 40 made up nearly half of the investors on the platform.\n\nAnd according to figures from Finder, Australians have an average of $24,020 \ufeffinvested in shares.\n\nThis casual investing may be funded by inheritance or a small amount of disposable income, Piotrowski said.\n\n\"We're in the midst of one of the largest transitions of wealth from the baby boomer generation to a younger generation,\" Piotrowski said.\n\nREAD MORE: Two teenagers charged with murder over deadly stabbing\n\nAccording to Finder, Australians have an average of $24,020 \ufeffinvested in shares.

    "text": "The first rendition of the Lions' simplistic, eponymous yet rousing chant had barely faded away at a packed Lang Park on Saturday night when Tom Curry nailed James Slipper with a massive shot in midfield.\n\nThe Englishman, just 12 seconds into the contest, was setting out his stall early.\n\nTadhg Beirne, his back-row partner, was over the ball in an instant and, just 20 seconds into the game, Ben O'Keeffe was blowing his whistle and pointing to the sky, a penalty to the Lions.\n\nThe British and Irish Lions walloped the Wallabies in the first half of the opening Test of the series, racing to a 24-5 lead off the back of that brutal intensity out of the gate.\n\nCurry, whose selection had been criticised heading into the Test, was one of those players who grabbed his opportunity and ran with it.\n\nTom Curry kept Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii quiet with some stifling defence. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\nHe helped keep the dangerous Wallabies centre partnership of Len Ikitau and Joseph Aukuso-Suaalii quiet with some monstrous defensive pressure.\n\nBeirne too, another member of that hotly contested back row that was given the nod for this first Test, was on the way to vindicating his selection with a player of the match performance.\n\nFarrell was not surprised though.\n\nDespite the commentary over their selection, the Ireland coach was unequivocal in how he felt Curry responded to his critics.\n\n\"Immense,\" he said of the English flanker.\n\n\"Absolutely immense.\"\n\nTom Curry scored a try for the Lions on top of an impressive defensive display. (AP Photo: Pat Hoelscher)\n\nThe 27-year-old had not been in great form on tour but, selected on account of his experience and temperament, repaid the faith Farrell showed in him with a stunning performance.\n\n\"I read all that,\" Farrell said, when asked whether they had vindicated his call.\n\n\"Yeah, it was interesting, wasn't it?\n\n\"Big game players, who were probably challenged by a good few and I think he told the story.\n\n\"I think Tom Curry put in a really nice shot defensively and Taidhg Beirne got the turnover very early doors, set the tone really and I don't think it stopped there.\n\n\"He carried on for the rest of the game, Jack Conan's carrying was very much on the front foot.\n\n\"So there was three guys, I'm sure they'd be delighted with how they responded to selection.\"\n\nAndy Farrell was impressed with Tom Curry. (Getty Images: David Rogers)\n\nBig game players on the biggest of stages.\n\nThe build-up to the first Test in Brisbane had been electric as the wave of Lions fans broke over south-east Queensland, the sea of red as evident in the pubs and clubs of Paddington as it was in the stands of a raucous crowd of 52,229 at Lang Park.\n\nAnd the Lions fans had plenty to roar about early, as the tourists took the game by the scruff of the neck held a 24-5 lead just after half time.\n\n\"Absolutely delighted,\" Farrell said of the performance.\n\n\"Big occasion, big game.\n\n\"We know what coming to Suncorp means to Australia, so they would have been targeting this, so delighted to come away with the victory.\"\n\nWallabies fall to defeat in opening Test as Lions power to victory Photo shows Sione Tuipulotu celebrates The British and Irish Lions have flexed their considerable muscles to beat the Wallabies 27-19 and take a 1-0 series lead at Brisbane's Lang Park on Saturday night.\n\nAnother of the Lions' \"big game\" players, Finn Russell, was orchestrating the back line with all the guile and skill of a virtuoso conductor, all quick hands and lightning thought.\n\nIt was five minutes in when Russell kicked a 50-22.\n\nSeven minutes in when he reached around Nick Champion de Crespigny to release Dan Sheehan.\n\nEight minutes in when he lofted a peach of a pass over three stricken Wallabies defenders onto the chest of Sione Tuipulotu to give the Lions a 10-0 lead inside the opening 10 minutes.\n\n\"I can't take any credit for that,\" Tuipulotu told media after the match.\n\n\"That's him finding me.\n\n\"It was kind of weird when he was throwing it, I felt like he was gonna throw it to that space and more I didn't have to do much, I just have to accelerate and catch the ball.\n\n\"That's what playing with special players is. It's pretty cool.\"\n\nSione Tuipulotu was thrilled to play alongside Finn Russell. (Getty Images: David Rogers)\n\nSpecial players.\n\nRussell left the field in the second half. Just cramp, according to Farrell, who said the Scotland 10 \"controlled\" the game perfectly with Jamison Gibson-Park.\n\n\"When they were able to show the best of themselves, we know what they've got in the locker as far as the point of difference is concerned. It came out every now and again and and that's the brilliance of the two,\" Farrell said.\n\nThe Lions coach is no doubt hopeful Russell will be OK to play at the MCG next week, the very biggest of stages that the Lions will have ever played on.\n\nSo will his Scotland teammate Tuipulotu.\n\n\"It felt like we were playing a Scotland game together, you know?\" said Tuipulotu, part of the first 10-12-13 axis from the same country to play in a Lions team since 1993.\n\n\"I think his nature helps everyone, calms everyone.\n\n\"And then added to the fact he's got probably the best skills out of any 10 in the world.\"\n\nWallabies number 10 Tom Lynagh said it was \"an incredible experience\" to play against Russell.\n\n\"It's a joy to play with, isn't it?\" he said, \"still shaking with adrenaline\" an hour after the full time siren.\n\nTom Lynagh said it was amazing to play opposite Finn Russell. (Getty Images: Sportsfile/Brendan Moran)\n\n\"You can't get starstruck about who you're playing against,\" he said, as if reminding himself.\n\n\"You've just got to play your game.\"\n\nLynagh in particular was far from starstruck, although the team as a whole was perhaps a little tentative, a young team against a squad of hardened veterans.\n\nThat being said, the Wallabies recovered from 24-5 down to fall just eight points short at the final.\n\n\"I thought we let them back into the game, \" Farrell said.\n\n\"It doesn't really matter whether you think the game was won or lost.\n\n\"I thought we let them back into the game in regards to a lack of discipline in the second half.\n\n\"I actually believe that's a fantastic place for us to be because there's so much more in us.\"\n\nMaro Itoje said the Lions \"weren't accurate with our decision making\".\n\n\"When you're not accurate with your decision making against a good team, you tend to put yourself under pressure.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nBut as much as Farrell said the Lions would take a lot from the victory, he said, \"We know what's coming\".\n\n\"We know what happened in the second half \u2026 We roll on to the second game knowing full well what happened in 2013.\n\n\"When an Australian team becomes desperate, it's difficult to handle.\n\n\"We expect a different game next week. But having said that, we expect more of ourselves as well.\n\n\"Not only is that Australia's second game and they'll play much better because of that, but because of what it means to them and how proud they are.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we're ready for them being 100 per cent at their best.\"",

(ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nIt's worrying experts, including the Australian Medical Association, whose president said West Australians should buckle up for a \"difficult couple of weeks ahead\".\n\n'More pathogenic'\n\nYuben Moodley is a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Western Australia, and said he expected this year to be the second-worst flu season in the last decade.\n\n\"The virus evolves and mutates every flu season and the aim of the virus is to avoid our immune response and to then infect cells more efficiently,\" Professor Moodley said.\n\n\"There's certain times and certain flu strains which are more effective in doing that than others.\n\n\" I think unfortunately we are in a situation where that virus mutation and the more pathogenic strain is what we have at the moment. \"\n\nAgeing population fears\n\nThat does not necessarily mean the flu is getting more severe, however.\n\n'Disaster waiting to happen': AMA sounds alarm on 'horror' WA flu season Photo shows Man holds a tissue to his face to blow his nose. The Australian Medical Association fears WA is in the midst of one of the state's worst flu seasons as cases soar and vaccination rates dwindle.\n\n\"What happens though is that we have an increasing ageing population who are becoming more susceptible to the flu,\" Professor Moodley said.\n\n\"The flu in a young, healthy person is not going to have major consequences, but if you have much more aged people, it certainly will result in more hospitalisations than previously.\n\n\"So an increase in the ageing population will result in increased presentations to the doctor or to hospital.\"\n\nIt comes as national data showed a 50 per cent increase in hospital admissions over a fortnightly period due to the winter surge.\n\nInfections ramping up\n\nThose increased presentations have been blamed for increased pressure on hospitals, as shown by ambulance ramping figures.\n\nAmbulances are considered \"ramped\" when they spend more than half-an-hour waiting outside a hospital to hand over a patient.\n\nThe average hours paramedics have spent ramped each day has been increasing significantly in WA since May, and is currently sitting just shy of records set at the peak of the pandemic.\n\nSystem 'performing well'\n\nPremier Roger Cook said it was not surprising the system would be under pressure at this time of year.\n\nHe also denied St John Ambulance struggling to meet its response time targets showed there needed to be extra capacity in the health system.\n\nWA has endured what the AMA described as a \"horror flu season\". (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"We need to make sure that we deploy taxpayers' funds in an efficient manner, so you don't want to have too much extra capacity, you don't want to have too little extra capacity,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a matter of balance.\n\n\"But [the system's] performing well \u2026 and we'll continue to look at how we can improve hospital services.\"\n\nRoger Cook insists the system is performing well despite the surge in flu cases. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nCook's view is in stark contrast to medical groups, including the Australian Medical Association, who suggest the state is at least 1,000 hospital beds short of being able to meet demand.\n\n\"While demand on our hospitals is high, it is being managed and pausing elective surgeries is not something that is being considered,\" Health Minister Meredith Hammat said during the week.\n\nEarly start to season\n\nCompounding issues is that WA's flu season started earlier than usual.\n\n\"This year in particularly, possibly because of increased travel over the last six months, we have seen a worse flu season earlier than we expected,\" WA Health Director General Shirley Bowen told budget estimates earlier in July.\n\n\"Normally in Western Australia we might see a flu peak in July, August or September, often more in the August period.\n\n\"This year we saw new cases in January. That is sort of an overflow from the situation in the UK and Europe.\"\n\nThe solutions, of course, seem simple: vaccination and staying home when sick.\n\nActually getting people to do either of those things is much more difficult.\n\nWestern Australia's flu vaccine coverage was 25.4 per cent at the end of June \u2014 one per cent behind the national average and tied for second-last with Queensland.\n\nVaccination push\n\nAsked on Friday if she was happy with the uptake of the vaccine, Seniors Minister Simone McGurk would only the say the government was \"sending a very, very strong message that we want people to be vaccinated\" by making it free.\n\nProfessor Moodley thinks more needs to be done.\n\n\"I think it is important to address vaccine scepticism a little more strongly,\"he said.\n\nYuben Moodley is a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Western Australia. (Supplied)\n\n\"Perhaps we can actually improve our outreach to people and to educate people better.\n\n\" I think governments are faced with a lot of vaccine scepticism due to social media and other issues. \"\n\nPreventative Health Minister Sabine Winton said earlier this month apathy was an issue.\n\n\"I am told the rate is about two per cent better than the case last year,\" she said.\n\nSabine Winton is urging people to make sure they are vaccinated. (ABC News: James Carmody)\n\n\"I do not want anyone to be complacent. We need to be doing much better than that to really have an even better impact on keeping people healthy and out of hospitals.\"\n\nLike anything in health, that's likely to be expensive and take a long time.\n\nIt means at this stage, as cases continue to grow, there's little to do but stick to the basics and manage the pressures that result.\n\nLoading...",

    "text": "Today it's the best-selling piano and solo jazz album of all time. But 50 years ago, Keith Jarrett's The K\u00f6ln Concert nearly didn't happen.\n\nBetween the substandard piano, an exhausting car journey, missing meals, and chronic back pain, Jarrett's iconic performance in the Cologne Opera House had the makings of a disaster.\n\nInstead, Jarrett turned it into something that has captured audiences for half a century.\n\nAs the K\u00f6ln Concert turns 50, the jazz world explores Jarrett's remarkable legacy and pays homage to an album that has inspired countless pianists.\n\nA child prodigy with a grounding in classical music\n\nJarrett was born in 1945 in Pennsylvania, USA. His parents fostered his early musical abilities, with the young Jarrett having perfect pitch and a knack for improvising at the piano.\n\nJarrett started lessons at age three and gave his first recital when he was just seven.\n\nJazz Legends: Keith Jarrett Photo shows Pianist Keith Jarrett looking at the camera Eric Ajaye explores the life and career of Keith Jarrett, from coming through the scene as a Jazz Messenger with Art Blakey to playing with Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis and then going on to break through as a solo artist.\n\nThe young artist was a fan of classical music. Throughout his career Jarrett has noted the influence of classical composers like J.S. Bach.\n\nJazz became a part of Jarrett's musical world when he was in high school, starting with artists like Dave Brubeck.\n\n\"Brubeck taught Jarrett about form and structure in jazz, and he could see how it behaved in a similar manner to the classical styles he'd already been mastering,\" shares Jazz Legends presenter, Eric Ajaye.\n\nKeith also became a fan of jazz artists pushing the boundaries, like pianist Paul Bley.\n\nA turned down opportunity opens a new world of music\n\nWhen he was 16, Jarrett had the chance to further his classical music studies in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, who taught some of the most famous musicians of the 20th century, from Daniel Barenboim to Quincy Jones.\n\nThe young pianist pulled out at the last minute and took a different direction.\n\nJarrett \"knew that if he really wanted to have an impact as an artist, he'd have to make his own discoveries and forge his own path,\" says Ajaye.\n\nInstead, Jarrett went to New York in 1964 and got his first big break playing Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers.\n\n\"Blakey wasn't Boulanger. Instead of teaching harmony and form he simply built bands around the energy of his youthful musicians,\" Ajaye says.\n\nFrom there, Jarrett's work spans the who's who of jazz. He worked with musicians at the top of their game like Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis, as well as producers including George Avakian who worked with artists from Louis Armstrong to Edith Piaf, and Manfred Eicher, founder of the renowned ECM record label.\n\nAjaye credits Davis as the first person to encourage Jarrett to perform solo. Davis's trumpet improvisations would also have a significant on Jarrett's future solo style.\n\n\"Both rely on extreme discipline and command of instruments and audiences, but both also required the daring to know when to abandon technique and simply play on impulse,\" Ajaye says.\n\nThat daring would go on to help create the biggest-selling solo jazz album of all time.\n\nThe series of mishaps that made a masterpiece\n\nThe events that lead up to the K\u00f6ln Concert hardly seem the right mix to create a record that would go on to sell over 4 million copies. But somehow it became a career-defining performance.\n\n\"This is a gig where everything went wrong, but the music still carried the day,\" says Ajaye.\n\n18-year-old concert promoter Vera Brandes invited Jarrett to perform the first-ever jazz concert in the Cologne Opera House.\n\nFrom broken piano to bestseller, Keith Jarrett's The K\u00f6ln Concert Photo shows Black and white picture of Keith performing at a piano. Jazz pianist and composer Matt McMahon joins Andrew Ford to talk us through the night of Keith Jarrett's K\u00f6ln Concert and its resultant music.\n\nThe pianist arrived in the city in the late afternoon after an arduous car trip from Zurich. Jarrett had been suffering from chronic back pain and turned up at the venue in a back brace to help him manage it.\n\nInstead of the full-size concert grand piano Jarrett had requested, the venue provided a baby grand from a rehearsal room that was in poor shape. It was out of tune, the sound quality wasn't great, and the pedals weren't working.\n\nJarrett already had a reputation for being demanding, but somehow Brandes and Eicher convinced him to go ahead with the sold-out concert, and to keep the recording engineers around to document the performance.\n\nJarrett and Eicher left for dinner while the piano technicians to tried to make the instrument playable.\n\nAfter a missed meal thanks to a restaurant error, at the very late starting time of 11:30pm, Jarrett started the performance that would go on to make history.\n\nTurning a 'shoddy' instrument to his advantage\n\nIn the K\u00f6ln concert, \"Jarrett produced one of the most profound improvised concerts of his career,\" says Ajaye.\n\nThe pianist took the confines of the \"shoddy\" instrument and worked around them or even using them to his advantage, \"drumming up improvised rhythms on the noisy pedals and using the tinny upper registers to create new texture.\"\n\n\"Jarrett was able to find some sort of magic within the confines of that old piano producing a brilliant performance full of lyrical melodic moments all on the fly,\" Ajaye says.\n\nAustralian jazz pianist Matt McMahon agrees. \"I think in a strange way, what happened with the K\u00f6ln concert, and this piano that was subpar, is it really clarified his playing,\" he shares with The Music Show's Andrew Ford.\n\nLike much of Jarrett's work, The K\u00f6ln Concert encompasses sounds that echoed then-familiar American musical traditions, like blues and gospel.\n\nMcMahon believes this might be a part of the album's success.\n\nHe suggests that \"even though from second to second, no one knows exactly where this is going next,\" the sounds of familiar genres help the audience feel more comfortable with the uncertainty.\n\nLeaving an enduring influence on the world of jazz\n\nJarrett was already popular by the time of the K\u00f6ln concert, but the success of the recording really put him on the map.\n\nMemories of Tomorrow: The New K\u00f6ln Concert Photo shows Keith Jarrett Hear a unique take on Keith Jarrett\u2019s famous 1975 K\u00f6ln Concert recording, in this performance by the German WDR Radio Orchestra as a suite for solo piano, jazz quartet, and orchestra.\n\nHis career continued to grow with solo and group performances and an enduring, fruitful relationship with ECM. His output spanned classical composers like Bach and Shostakovich, as well as his original work.\n\nFollowing disruptions to his career from back pain and chronic fatigue, in 2018 Jarrett had a series of strokes that caused some paralysis.\n\nAfter rehabilitation, Jarrett regained enough mobility to play piano with his right hand, but \"we may never see the master perform a live concert again,\" says Ajaye.\n\nHowever, Jarrett's incredible influence on jazz is still being felt today.\n\n\"Keith Jarrett will forever be remembered for the way he elevated not just the piano but also jazz as a whole, taking the art of improvisation to places where it hadn't gone before,\" says Ajaye.\n\nUpdates from ABC Jazz direct to your inbox in the ABC Classic newsletter",

(ABC News: Claire Moodie)\n\n\"The original intent of the electric highways was really to open Western Australia up and enable people from Perth to travel through the south-west and allow our regional members with electric vehicles to travel to Perth,\" Mr Golsby told Gary Adshead on ABC Radio Perth.\n\nLong queues and broken chargers leave EV drivers anxious Photo shows An electric car drives through green countryside. Charger anxiety replaces range anxiety for the growing number of electric vehicle users relying on slow infrastructure.\n\n\" We saw this as a demonstration project to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. \"\n\nIn 10 years, the number of fully electric vehicles in WA has grown to about 27,000, and there are about 150 charging stations across the state.\n\nThe state government has spent more than $43 million on subsidies to help people buy electric vehicles and committed $21 million to extending the charging network.\n\nThe moment EVs became 'unstoppable'\n\nMr Golsby said that, having demonstrated that owning an electric vehicle was a viable option in WA, the RAC had decided to move on, withdrawing from its involvement in the electric highway.\n\n\"We wanted to open up the state to EVs,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe there's been significant growth. We hope there will be more growth in electric vehicles.\"\n\nFor Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA) president Chris Jones, it is the end of an era in the evolution of electric transport in WA.\n\nChris Jones says the electric highway was a turning point for EV uptake in WA. (ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne)\n\nIt was Dr Jones, along with two others, who first pitched the idea of building the charging network to the RAC 10 years ago.\n\n\"It started because I was unemployed and looking for something to do. I wrote a 10-page document on how you would build charging in the south-west,\" Dr Jones said.\n\n\"We found the ideal spots and what the layout would look like, and we pitched it to anyone that would listen.\"\n\nMany potential funders and government agencies said no, but the RAC took the idea seriously.\n\n\"They came back and said: 'You know what, this is absolutely something we should be supporting', and they did,\" Dr Jones said.\n\n\" For me, it was the moment I knew EVs were unstoppable, when an organisation like the RAC was prepared to tip $1 million into it, even though there were only around 80 EVs on the road at the time. \"\n\nDr Jones said he was not surprised the highway project had now come to an end.\n\nCouncils bow out\n\nThe RAC purchased and installed electric-highway charging stations, but they were then owned and managed by local governments.\n\n\"Councils weren't prepared for what it took to look after this sort of equipment,\" Dr Jones said.\n\n\"You have to learn new skills, get familiar with new technology. You don't make much money from it.\"\n\nChinese EV newcomer Xiaomi's bumper sales Photo shows A man standing on stage presenting an electriv SUV to an audience.

(ABC News: Bill Lawrie)\n\n\"It's just not something we feel that we should be taking on,\" he said, adding that a local shopping centre in Dunsborough had installed four fast charging stations in its car park, providing drivers with other options.\n\nIn the case of the Busselton charging station, the council is inviting expressions of interest from businesses who would like to take over the charger.\n\nWorkplace charging new frontier\n\nWhile it is the end of an era for electric driving in WA, the RAC said it had achieved what it set out to do.\n\n\"It was Australia's first. Other states now claim to have the bigger, larger, longer, wider highways, but certainly this was Australia's first,\" Mr Golsby said.\n\n\" It's something that we're very proud of. \"\n\nFor AEVA, it was a major boost to its lobbying efforts in WA.\n\n\"Buoyed by [the electric highway], we put the effort into lobbying the WA government into building a decent charging network around the state,\" Dr Jones said.\n\n\"I think the next effort we will need to see in public charging will be workplace charging.\"",

The Wallabies came up short in the first Test against the Lions in Brisbane, giving coach Joe Schmidt questions he needs to answer before the series moves to Melbourne.\n\nWith the match only 20 seconds old, the Wallabies conceded a penalty to allow Finn Russell to give the Lions a 3-0 lead, which they built upon only minutes later when Sione Tuipulotu scored a converted try.\n\nEarly in the second half, the Lions led 24-5, but the Wallabies showed spirit to score two tries inside the final 13 minutes of the match to cut the final margin to eight points.\n\nThey perhaps could have put the Lions under pressure midway through the second half, had a Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii try not been disallowed.\n\n\"I felt we fought our way back into the game,\" Schmidt said at the post-match media conference.\n\n\"I felt if we could get within one score, you never know what could happen.\n\n\"I'm not saying the Lions didn't deserve to win it, because I feel that they did on the balance of what they did in that first quarter and first half.\n\n\"Immediately after half-time it was a bridge that was a long way away to try to get from five [points] to 24.\n\n\"So we'll have a look in the cold light of day and be a bit more analytical \u2026 but [I'm] very proud of the way the players fought their way back.\"\n\nLions fly-half Finn Russell helped direct his side's attack. (Getty Images: Albert Perez)\n\nSchmidt said the Lions' halves pairing of Russell and Jamison Gibson-Park was pivotal in the tourists' win.\n\n\"I thought Jamison Gibson-Park and Finn Russell controlled the game incredibly well for the Lions,\" he said.\n\n\"They didn't give a lot of breathing space and that made it tough for us to find access points into the game. They got a lot of pressure around the collision area.\n\n\"So there are things obviously we are going to look at and address the balance. I think there are some positives for us to take away.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the predictions were before the game but to have a margin of eight points I think is testament to the character of the players and the way they fought back.\"\n\nSchmidt said Rob Valetini and lock Will Skelton would be available for next Saturday night's second Test at the MCG.\n\nBoth were ruled out of the first Test with calf injuries but trained on Saturday morning.\n\nLynagh solid in starting debut\n\nSchmidt praised Tom Lynagh's performance as Wallabies fly-half in what was his first start at Test level.\n\nLynagh \u2014 whose father Michael played for the Wallabies in the same position against the Lions 36 years ago \u2014 showed no signs of being intimidated in just his fourth Test.\n\nHe survived being tackled in the air by Tom Curry on the stroke of half-time, an incident that could have earned the Lions back-rower a yellow card.\n\n\"Not a lot of front-foot opportunity for him [Lynagh] but there's no way he lacks for courage,\" Schmidt said.\n\n\"He made some really good tackles out there, carried the ball when he needed to, slipped through and got a nice offload away at one stage.\n\n\"I thought he kicked pretty well, as well.\"\n\nTom Lynagh attracted praise for his performance against the Lions. (AAP: Dave Hunt)\n\nLynagh said he was not overwhelmed by the occasion, with a crowd of 52,229 in attendance at Lang Park.\n\n\"No nerves going into the game, no point to prove,\" he said.\n\n\"Just [went] out there and [played] my game.\"\n\nWallabies winger Max Jorgensen \u2014 who scored a spectacular try in the first half \u2014 admired Lynagh's resolve under the defensive pressure exerted by the Lions.\n\n\"He's a bloody tough kid. He takes some shots but gets up straight away,\" Jorgensen said.\n\n\"For him to make his starting debut, I'm stoked for him. He's a bloody good player.\"",

An unusual outbreak of monkeypox has now spread to at least 15 countries. Here's what we know about the disease, which is rarely seen outside of Africa.\n\nMpox is a viral infection with typically mild symptoms, including fever, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a rash or lesions.\n\nIn a statement, the department said there was a low danger of the virus spreading.\n\n\"The community can be assured that exposure to members of the community has been very limited and the public should not be concerned,\" it said.\n\n\"Mpox does not spread easily between people and is mainly spread through very close or intimate contact with someone infected.\"\n\nContact tracing underway\n\nHealth Minister Tim Nicholls said the infection was acquired in central Africa and contact tracing was underway.\n\n\"He was not contagious on the return journey to Australia from Africa and those close contacts that he has been in contact with, including at the emergency ward and in other locations, are being contact traced right now and identified,\" Mr Nicholls said.\n\nHe said the department had identified 19 community contacts, including members of the man's family, and 40 hospital staff contacts.\n\nHead of infectious diseases at the Princess Alexandra Hospital Doctor Geoffrey Playford said he did not expect the number of community cases to increase.\n\nDr Geoffrey Playford says the number of infected people is unlikely to increase.

    "text": "It was typical of Barrie Robran that when he was asked to reflect on what he described as his \"claim to fame\" on the sporting field, he chose to dwell on the abilities of someone other than himself.\n\nWhat made his answer surprising was not so much its humility as the fact that it did not involve the sport with which Robran's name will be forever associated.\n\nSince his death last week at the age of 77, Robran has been widely remembered as the greatest Australian rules footballer South Australia has produced.\n\nSouth Australia's greatest player, who never came to the VFL Photo shows A South Australian Australian rules player smiles, surrounded by streamers and fans as he rides in a car in a parade. From Barrie Robran to John Halbert, South Australia is a hotbed of footy talent that went largely unnoticed in the east. As the AFL heads to Adelaide for Gather Round, we look back at the best of the bunch.\n\nBut in an interview with the ABC a quarter of a century ago, Robran highlighted the time that he and Barry Richards \u2014 the swashbuckling South African who helped South Australia secure the 1970/71 Sheffield Shield \u2014 played cricket together for Adelaide side Prospect.\n\n\"I say my claim to fame is that I opened the batting one year with Barry Richards, and he's the best cricketer or the best batsman that I've ever seen,\" Robran said.\n\n\"I wasn't fortunate enough to ever have seen Don Bradman play but I wished in some way that I could because if Sir Donald was a better batsman than Barry Richards, I think my sporting life's the poorer for not having seen Sir Donald bat.\"\n\nThe reflection was tender and poignant, and was uttered with the soft-spoken sincerity for which Robran was renowned.\n\nBut in the eyes of at least one observer, there was perhaps no need for Robran to have felt the twinge of regret.\n\nWhile Robran may not have seen Bradman at the crease, commentator Bruce McAvaney is very much of the view that the former was, in some sense, an heir to the latter, and that their names will always belong in the same breath.\n\n\"We're talking of the Bradman of footy,\" McAvaney said of Robran on Wednesday.\n\nBarrie Robran, pictured at the North Adelaide Football Club's 2024 club champion award night, died last week at the age of 77. (Facebook: North Adelaide Football Club)\n\nRobran would naturally have rejected the comparison, but McAvaney was adamant.\n\n\"Barrie's a genius, and I say that with absolute conviction. He was a genius on the football field,\" McAvaney said.\n\nThat genius will today be commemorated when Robran's North Adelaide takes on Port Adelaide in the SANFL at Prospect Oval.\n\nA minute's silence has been held before the bounce of every SANFL competition match this weekend, and players and umpires will again wear black armbands when the Roosters \u2014 for whom Robran played 201 matches \u2014 and Port Adelaide take to the field this afternoon.\n\n\"He'd come to every game and sit on the eastern side with his deck chair and his two mates,\" Roosters CEO Craig Burton said.\n\n\"The words 'good bloke' get thrown around a lot but he's right at the top of the list.\"\n\n'We will miss him dearly'\n\nIn a statement released late on Friday, members of Robran's family said they had been \"overwhelmed\" by the \"many kind and thoughtful words and memories\" that had been shared about their \"loving and caring husband, father, grandfather, and uncle\".\n\nThe Barrie Robran statue at Adelaide Oval was decorated with a North Adelaide Football Club scarf following news of the champion's death. (ABC News: Ashlin Blieschke)\n\nWhile they \"respectfully declined\" a government offer of a state service, they said they had taken \"solace in the knowledge that Barrie's impact and influence on so many was so great, in such a positive way\".\n\n\"His loss will have a profound impact on us all and we will miss him dearly,\" the family said.\n\n\"Those who knew him appreciated his humility, reflected in a preference to let his achievements speak for themselves.\n\n\"We will be following Barrie's wishes for a small private family funeral.\"\n\nFor some, Robran's death has been a moment to reflect on the passing not just of a great of the game, but of a golden age.\n\nWhy SA football legend Barrie Robran was one of the greats Photo shows A veteran SANFL footballer runs out on an oval with a football under his arm, as fans cheer and hold red and white balloons. Silky skills, versatility and an ability to make other players \"look foolish without even looking\" \u2014 Barrie Robran had it all, according to those who played football with him.\n\nRobran's biographer Bruce Pointon said those who had grown up watching South Australian football in the 1970s had been privileged to see some of the state's best-ever players, including Robran and Russell Ebert.\n\n\"They were really stars and made the game quite attractive,\" he said.\n\nPart of the attraction, Pointon explained, was the fact that Australian rules was then a more open game.\n\nWhile Pointon said football had become faster and more intense, the way it was played in the 1970s showcased the game's basic skills.\n\n\"I think a lot of the time the skills were more cleanly performed and more appreciated by the crowd because there was such an openness,\" he said.\n\n\"In those days you had a position to play and the zone of your involvement in the game was fairly strongly insisted upon, 'You're a half-forward flanker, you're a back pocket, so what are you doing down at centre wing?'\n\n\"There was a much bigger emphasis on the position that the person played and therefore the role that that implied.\"\n\nRobran (left) with fellow great Russell Ebert and eminent commentator Bruce McAvaney. (Supplied: Jordan Bianchini PAFC )\n\nAnother major difference between football then and now is the remuneration to which players are entitled \u2014 a point made by Robran himself in his interview with ABC Radio in 2000.\n\n\"The first year I played football in Adelaide for North Adelaide, I played 19 matches and I received $5 a game, which was a total of $95,\" Robran said of the year he debuted, in 1967.\n\n\"Now some of them are getting \u2014 I dread to think what some of them are getting, but in the tens of thousands of dollars a game. I guess it's all relative but it certainly didn't detract from my enjoyment.\"\n\nDespite football's evolution, both Bruces \u2014 Pointon and McAvaney \u2014 remain certain of one thing: Robran would have excelled regardless of the age in which he played.\n\n\"His skills of manoeuvring and dodging and weaving ... made him a very, very difficult person to tackle,\" Pointon said.\n\n\"I don't think anyone read the game any better than Barrie. He could get to the contest as well as anybody,\" McAvaney added.",

    "text": "Jess Hull has gone record hunting again, smashing her own Australian and Oceanian mile marks but still having to settle for second best at a star-studded Diamond League meeting in London.\n\nWhile Hull and high jumper Eleanor Patterson grabbed runners-up spots at the London Stadium to lead the Australian challenge in front of a 60,000 full house on Saturday, it also proved a landmark day for Newcastle's Rose Davies, who obliterated her own national and Oceanian 5,000m marks while finishing third.\n\nBut on another promising afternoon for Australia's athletes, as they started building their preparations for the Tokyo World Championships, there was a setback for young miling sensation Cam Myers, whose promising bid in the meeting-concluding 1,500m ended with an on-track bump.\n\nOlympic metric mile silver medallist Hull's eyes must have lit up when Gudaf Tsegay seemed to be setting a suicidal pace in the mile, but as the Wollongong ace moved up to her shoulder, Ethiopia's former double world champ found an extra gear to win comfortably in a new national record 4 minutes and 11.88 seconds.\n\nHull's substantial consolation was to lower her own Oceanian mark to 4:13.68.\n\n\"I had a lot of distractions, but was just trying to zone into the leader in the second half, but it was a solid run,\" Hull said.\n\n\"Coming in, we were thinking I could run a national record, and I did. I would have liked to have been a little closer to 4:10, but I felt very strong for 4:13.\n\n\"A lot of records fell today, so it was a pretty special to be a part of that race.\"\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Davies clocked 14:31.45 for third behind the Ethiopian duo of Medina Eisa (14:30.57) and Fantaye Belayneh (14:30.90), her run eclipsing her previous national mark of 14:40.83, set in China in April, by more than nine seconds.\n\nGeorgia Griffith finished fifth in a huge new personal best 14:32.82 to also smash the former record.\n\n\"I was ready for a big race and felt like I responded to the challenge today,\" Davies said.\n\n\"My expectations were a PB [personal best] and I have achieved that so I am really pleased.\"\n\nFormer high jump world champ Patterson was surprised her 1.93 metre clearance was enough to earn her the silver as even Olympic champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh had an off-day, allowing British home hope Morgan Lake to win with a 1.96m leap.\n\n\"I am very honoured to be known as 'Miss Consistent' as it reflects my aim to be consistently jumping well,\" Patterson said.\n\n\"Today doesn't quite match up to it \u2014 but if 1.93 is a bad day, and second, I can't be too mad about it.\"\n\nMyers, the 19-year-old Canberran phenomenon who has had a stunning year in the senior ranks already while finishing runner-up in Oslo's Dream Mile, looked ready for the next step as he moved sweetly into contention on the final lap of the metric mile.\n\nBut about to make his move in fourth, he and Briton George Mills clipped heels, taking each other out of contention, and Myers ended up limping home way down in 13th place in 4:24.03, wondering what might have been as another teenage superstar, Kenya's Phanuel Koech, won in the fastest time ever seen in the UK, 3:28.82.\n\nInternational highlight of the day may have been Olympic 100m champion Julien Alfred smashing her own national St Lucian record while running the fastest 200m in the world this year (21.71 seconds).\n\nAustralian hope Torrie Lewis finished last in 23.05.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "Most people's smartphones and social media accounts are filled with happy snaps of birthdays, weddings, family gatherings and holidays.\n\nBut it's much less common for someone to pull out their phone or hire a professional to take photos at a funeral.\n\nThis story contains an image of a deceased child in a casket from 1935.\n\nWarrnambool-based photographer Eddie Guerrero decided to expand his business into the area of funeral photography after receiving requests for casket photos.\n\nHe is now a member of the small funeral photography industry, but says it's not a service for everyone.\n\n\"Usually when you are doing photos, you are doing photos of happy events like the first day of school, graduation \u2026 sports events, but the funerals are pure emotions,\" he said.\n\nEddie Guerrero wanted to document funerals as celebrations of a person's life. (Supplied: Eddie Guerrero)\n\n\"It's a difficult market \u2026 because for some people it's like you are doing a job as a paparazzi,\" he said.\n\n\"My intention is to do photos in a respectful way.\n\n\"That's my job \u2014 tell that story, share with the family, and then when they are ready, they can look back on that day.\"\n\nFunerals also provide a rare opportunity for family portraits. (Supplied: Eddie Guerrero)\n\nGrief is a tribute\n\nJohn Leha lost his mother in March, on his 40th birthday.\n\nThe Birri Gubba, Wakka Wakka and Tongan man had never heard of funeral photography until he saw an example book advertised by a funeral parlour.\n\nJohn Leha says being vulnerable is an important part of healing. (Supplied: John Leha)\n\n\"I just thought it was so beautiful and so moving,\" he said.\n\n\"I wanted to be able to capture the emotions and the feelings, and for it to really honour \u2026 the memory of my mother in the emotions that were expressed by the mourners.\"\n\nHe said the resulting book helped to start conversations about his mother and provided a record of family ties as a reference for future generations.\n\nJohn Leha says funerals are an opportunity for younger family members to see their elders being vulnerable. (Supplied: John Slaytor)\n\n\"[It's] much like a tombstone in that you have the person's name, their children, and you try to capture the relationship they've had,\" he said.\n\n\" But a headstone is just a headstone, it doesn't really pay homage to the full kinship, and some of those photos capture that. \"\n\nSydney-based photographer John Slaytor says certain cultures are more open to funeral photography and acknowledge that grief is an ongoing process.\n\nJohn Slaytor says that, in contrast to adults, children act as \"emotional mirrors\" at funerals. (Supplied: John Slaytor)\n\n\"I think Anglo-Saxons are the worst [at processing grief]. I mean, they have the funeral and that's it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's no opportunity to sort of go back and deal with the grief afterwards, and I think \u2026 we need to think a lot harder about that.\"\n\nJohn Slaytor says his service is particularly popular with Aboriginal and Croatian families. (Supplied: John Slaytor)\n\nMr Slaytor has been focused on funeral photography and portraiture since 2009, and hopes his work gives an opportunity to \"allow the grief to surface\".\n\n\"I just like humans being gentle with each other, and that's in abundance at funerals,\" he said.\n\n\"Weddings in my experience are about consumption, and so I find that offensive.\n\n\" I don't find anything offensive about funerals. \"\n\nJohn Slaytor no longer works at weddings. (Supplied: John Slaytor)\n\nHuman connection\n\nMr Slaytor photographed Mr Leha's mother's funeral, and some of his work is in a collection at the State Library of New South Wales.\n\nThe collection also includes photographs from public funerals of celebrities and politicians.\n\nBut of the 2 million photographs in the collection, only a tiny fraction feature private funerals.\n\nA naval funeral last month in Sydney. (Supplied: John Slaytor)\n\n\"Funeral photography's been around since the inception of photography,\" senior curator Geoff Barker said.\n\nIn Victorian times, Mr Barker says the focus was on open caskets and still photographs indoors, due to the cumbersome nature of the equipment.\n\nThis child was photographed in a casket at a Sydney funeral home by Sam Hood in 1935. (Supplied: State Library of NSW)\n\n\"Because John Slaytor has that intimate relationship with the families \u2026 you kind of get a feeling of the emotions and what's going on in the funeral, as opposed to the early [historical] photos which often feel a bit distant,\" Mr Barker said.\n\nGeoff Barker says there are many funeral photos on phones and hard drives, but few in cultural collections. (Supplied: State Library of NSW)\n\nPreserving memories\n\nMichelle Bova has been in the funeral photography industry for 15 years, and has grown her business from a solo enterprise to more than a dozen staff.\n\nShe says funeral photography remains a small part of the business, even after the COVID-19 pandemic normalised live-streaming and videography.\n\nMichelle Bova says it's difficult to make a living from funeral photography alone. (Supplied: Michelle Bova)\n\n\"It's a smaller field, though it's always been there,\" she said.\n\nShe sees people turning to funeral photography as a way to preserve memories for younger generations.\n\n\"Families are so stressed leading up to the day, there's a lot they don't remember,\" she said.",

(ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nForeign fishers illegally entering northern Australian waters have been caught in their dozens in the remote Top End in the past 12 months, marking a concerning spike in cases.\n\nThe Australian Fisheries Management Authority said 237 foreign fishers had been prosecuted in the Darwin Local Court since July 2024, up from 75 fishers the 12 months prior, and from just 36 cases in 2022-23.\n\nSome fishers attempt to disguise their boats. (Supplied: Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation)\n\nThe fishers have been entering Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) trying to take a haul of the north's lucrative marine life, such as trepang (sea cucumber) and shark fin, both considered delicacies in China.\n\nMany of them hail from poverty-stricken villages in Indonesia.\n\nMore than 200 foreign fishers have been prosecuted in the Darwin Local Court since July 2024.

(ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nRangers face uphill challenges, safety risks\n\nOn the frontline of trying to spot these fishers are Aboriginal ranger groups across the remote Top End.\n\nAs well as illegal fishers, during the past year rangers have also reported instances of people smuggling, including a case where a group of suspected Chinese nationals were left stranded in remote bushland.\n\nDhimurru Aboriginal Corporation's executive officer, Stephina Salee, said her ranger group managed an area of land and sea country larger than 550,000 hectares \u2014 roughly 42,000 hectares per ranger.\n\nDhimurru rangers have to patrol a large area of land. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\n\"That's equivalent to the size of the urban setting of Singapore,\" she said.\n\n\"Rangers are there to manage land and sea \u2026 for their people, and that in itself is a massive role.\n\n\"And on top of it, now we're having to do border security, which is very difficult.\n\n\" It's a massive problem. \"\n\nStephina Salee says rangers are splitting their time between land and sea management, and border patrol. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nMs Salee said the intrusion of foreign fishers into Arnhem Land waters also brought with it elements of danger.\n\nShe said that earlier this year, illegal fishers were discovered by traditional owners near the remote Wessel Islands, just outside of the Dhimurru IPA, with one of the fishers reportedly holding a firearm.\n\nAustralian Border Force (ABF) said in a statement it had found no cases of illegal foreign fishers carrying firearms on vessels in Northern Territory waters in 2025.\n\n\"The ABF strongly encourages community members to report any such incidents to the Northern Territory Police immediately,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nOne illegal fisher found by rangers was reportedly carrying a firearm. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nCalls for rangers to have more powers\n\nDhimurru leaders said rangers had been left under-resourced and legally powerless to properly enforce the growing issue.\n\nCurrently, the ABF is the main authority for border protection in the north, and has launched Operation Lunar to target illegal foreign fishing in the NT following the recent uptick.\n\nThe ABF has previously been criticised for its slow response to the influx.\n\nGrace Wunungmurra says the foreign fishing vessels are hard to spot, and she wants rangers to be granted more powers to stamp out the illegal activity. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nMs Salee said rangers should be given additional powers to be able to deal with the fishers or smugglers at the point of contact, rather than simply reporting it, and having to wait for ABF officers or other authorities to attend.\n\n\"A bit of power to actually enact and re-enforce some of the laws here, within these waters,\" she said.\n\nStephina Salee says rangers are under-resourced to deal with illegal foreign fishers. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nOut on the water, Ms Wunungmurra said having extra enforcement powers would help to police the problem.\n\n\"It'd be awesome to have rangers \u2026 have the power to go out and fine someone for doing the wrong thing out on country,\" she said.\n\nGrace Wunungmurra and Paul Augustin are part of the team searching NT waters. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nNorthern Land Council chair Matt Ryan agreed, calling it \"a matter of national security and biosecurity\".\n\n\"Traditional owners are sick and tired of their hard-fought sea rights being disrespected,\" he said.\n\n\"Aboriginal ranger groups must be better equipped with compliance powers, appropriate training and proper resources in order to continue protecting the northern Australian coastline.\n\n\"Authorities and agencies must work closely with Aboriginal ranger groups and land councils to determine what powers would be most appropriate and effective in dealing with these matters.\"\n\nThe ranger team are guided by onboard navigation systems. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nHome Affairs Minister Tony Burke did not directly answer questions about whether additional powers for rangers would be considered by the federal government.\n\n\"The relationship with Indigenous rangers was unfortunately allowed to collapse over the last decade,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"I am always looking for opportunities to strengthen that vital relationship.\"\n\nAn ABF spokesperson said the organisation was \"collaborating\" with rangers to co-design an Indigenous-led partnership which would \"collectively address shared border protection challenges\".\n\nRangers question future of asylum seekers found in remote NT Photo shows two chinese men standing next to each other with their faces blurred An Indigenous ranger group that rescued four asylum seekers on a remote island off the Northern Territory coast last week is calling for the federal government to guarantee their safety.\n\n\"Specifically, the partnership will lead to more effective operational cooperation through coordinated coastal patrols and intelligence sharing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Ranger groups involved in operations will focus on information gathering and surveillance, not apprehensions or arrests.\"\n\nThe ABF also said it was holding training programs over the next few months to \"immediately upskill ranger groups\", including in \"intelligence collection, personal safety and operational planning\".\n\n\"These programs are only just the beginning,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMs Salee said it was now incumbent on government agencies to prove they were listening to ranger groups as they dealt with the influx.\n\n\"Come and have a seat at our table, let us take you out [on the water],\" she said.\n\n\"Let us show you the problem, because we also have the solution.\"",

(Supplied: Ginger Sport)\n\nThat is what his friends, who became family, wanted to remember on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThey gathered at Albert Park in Melbourne underneath a stunning blue sky.\n\nMany were still in disbelief that a beloved member of the Albert Park Allstars, perhaps the brightest star of them all, had been taken in such horrific circumstances.\n\nMembers of the team listen as a letter from Zdravko Bilic's wife is read to the group. (ABC Melbourne: Simon Tucci)\n\n\"We all need to be here to grieve together,\" friend John Christodulakis said.\n\n\"We've [Allstars] been going for 30 years and he was a part of this for around 25 years.\n\n\" So this is part of his family and has been a big part of his world as much as he's been a big part of our world. \"\n\nJohn Christodulakis and George Josevski with Zdravko Bilic's team shirt. (ABC Melbourne: Rachel Clayton)\n\nZed there 'in spirit'\n\nMr Bilic died at his Sunshine Coast home last Sunday night.\n\nPolice have alleged two teenage boys, aged 15 and 17, broke into the Warana home Mr Bilic shared with his wife of nearly 20 years, Gry T\u00f8mte.\n\nShe was interstate at the time of the incident but has since returned to their home.\n\nBefore the match was played on Saturday, friend George Josevski read out a letter from Ms T\u00f8mte, who also sent down her late husband's jersey so he could be there \"in spirit\".\n\nGeorge Josevski reads the group a letter from Zdravko Bilic's wife Gry T\u00f8mte. (ABC Melbourne: Simon Tucci)\n\n\"I'm pretty confident when I say that Zed loved his Albert Park Allstars almost as much as he loved our pups and I,\" she wrote.\n\n\"In fact when I told Zed I wanted to move up north, his response was, 'No way, I've got Saturday soccer.'\n\n\"It was a point of contention for more than a year, with me telling him he could fly down every weekend and besides, 'You'll find a team up there'.\n\n\"To which he replied, 'But never one like this, we're family.'\"\n\nThe couple eventually moved to the Sunshine Coast three years ago, but remained in regular contact with their Melbourne friends.\n\nZdravko Bilic and his wife Gry T\u00f8mte. (Facebook)\n\nMr Bilic did indeed find a new team, and new friends are now also mourning his loss.\n\nBut every Saturday, he would send a message to the Allstars Snapchat group and last Saturday was no different, as he jokingly bragged about having to endure another picture-perfect day by the beach.\n\n\"He made you the centre of the universe, and you knew you were important in his life,\" Mr Christodulakis said.\n\n\"He didn't have a bad bone in his body, he was just a beautiful, happy person.\"\n\nThe Allstars team in action on Saturday afternoon. (ABC Melbourne: Simon Tucci)\n\nMr Josevski said Mr Bilic had always been welcoming of new players.\n\n\"He just took everyone under his wing, the energy, the positivity and just the love. That's all he gave, love and care,\" Mr Josevski said.\n\n\"And to be taken away tragically, unnecessarily, it's just hard to take.\"\n\nHe said family and friends had been buoyed by the messages of support they had received from around the country and the world.",

Steven Woodburn Previous Slide Next Slide Loulou Martin Place might have just missed last week\u2019s Bastille Day celebrations, but its launch on Tuesday, July 22 is the latest instalment in a resurgence of French restaurants in the Sydney CBD. The reflective silver ceiling sparkles at the 150-seat new bistro, which sits at one of the entrances to Sydney\u2019s shiny new Metro. There are plenty of the design accoutrements you might find in a Paris bistro, including a large marble bar and patterned flooring. The new Loulou even has its own oyster and wine counter. The Martin Place restaurant is an offshoot of the northside Loulou original which opened in Milsons Point in 2021. The blue design hues of its older sister have been transplanted across the bridge, as have signature dishes such as John Dory with a champagne sauce. Loulou\u2019s lunch-special steak frites encased in a baguette. Steven Woodburn\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt joins a wave of CBD French arrivals over the past few years, including the rebooted Monopole and Manon Brasserie, and others that married French with other influences \u2013 Bistro Nido and The Charles among them. Loulou head chef Ned Parker says French food has a resonance with Sydneysiders, \u201cIt\u2019s comfort food to people, even that potato bake [everyone cooks at home] comes back to French.\u201d Parker worked in restaurants in Europe, including London\u2019s three-Michelin-starred Ledbury, before joining Loulou at Milsons Point. While Loulou aims to be an approachable bistro, the chef doesn\u2019t cut corners. The pepper sauce, for example, requires a two-day process to make the base stock. Sourdough crumpet with avocado and optional caviar. Steven Woodburn Petit Loulou, which opened downstairs in February, will supply baked goods to the new bistro for its breakfast menu. Parker says commuters will be able to start the day with a caramelised brioche, sourdough crumpet with avocado (caviar is an optional extra) or a classic omelette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring weekday happy hour (4-7pm) there will be $2 escargots and oysters, while the lunch and dinner carte lists Toulouse sausage with pomme puree, a mushroom and truffle vol-au-vent, seafood platters and French onion soup. Steak frites are having a bigger moment than usual in the CBD, with 24 York opening on July 23 and taking inspiration from Le Relais de l\u2019Entrecote in France, which has successfully leant on the dish for more than half a century. Bouillon l\u2019Entrecote at Circular Quay is another go-to venue for French-style steak and chips. Steak and many frites. Steven Woodburn \u201cOur focus won\u2019t be on steak,\u201d says Parker of the opening menu at Loulou Martin Place. However, with steak frites one of the best sellers at the Milsons Point restaurant, it still features on the menu, along with a version encased in a baguette. \u201cWe want to bring that feeling of a neighbourhood restaurant across to the city,\u201d says Parker said. Plans are underway for the brand\u2019s further expansion, too. Later this year, a fast version of Loulou Bistro will open at the Qantas Domestic Terminal at Sydney Airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreakfast and lunch Monday-Friday; dinner Monday-Saturday 1 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, loulou.sydney\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

    "text": "The sound in Brisbane was not of rage or rancour, merely one of bleak, sullen resignation. On a galling evening for the Wallabies, this stadium, traditionally such a cauldron for the hosts, felt more like a mausoleum, with home fans\u2019 despair at their team\u2019s inadequacies so all-engulfing that the hype man had to plead with them to \u201cmake some noise\u201d.\n\nAfter a 12-year wait for their players to collide with the British and Irish Lions once more, they had dared to expect some snarl and defiance befitting the occasion. But instead they witnessed a glaring mismatch, with the lack of cohesion on the pitch so painful that rare incursions into the tourists\u2019 22 were greeted with bitterly ironic cheers.\n\nAll told, the shift in atmosphere had taken just 42 minutes, with Dan Sheehan punishing an errant Australian line-out to put the Lions out of sight. At kick-off the scene on Caxton Street, on the approach to Suncorp Stadium, had been magnificent, with the seething convergence of red shirts an encapsulation of everything a Lions Test should be.\n\nThe series opener would soon curdle, though, into a grisly reckoning for Australia, whose status as the sixth-best team in the world looked flattering in the face of the Lions\u2019 bombardment and eventual 27-19 win. While their deficiencies had been well-documented, surely they would channel some snarl, some quintessential Queensland defiance, in a city that demanded it?",

    "text": "Pressed on specifics, Driussi was diplomatically vague: \u201cWe\u2019re exploring multiple AI applications, but competitive advantage comes from execution, not just ideas. The technology helps us analyse information and identify patterns that might otherwise be missed.\u201d What makes the Bulldogs\u2019 AI adoption particularly intriguing is Driussi\u2019s other role as CEO of Quantium, an Australian artificial intelligence and advanced analytics company. The firm works with major Australian companies, such as Woolworths, Commonwealth Bank, Telstra and Qantas. Bulldogs players are already benefiting from AI. Credit: Getty Images The connection provides the Bulldogs access to world-class AI expertise that would typically cost NRL clubs millions of dollars to develop themselves. While Driussi is careful not to discuss any formal arrangements, the potential for knowledge transfer is obvious. The \u201cFamily Club\u201d previously revealed it used AI to identify Jacob Preston during his recruitment from the Roosters\u2019 pathways system, suggesting the technology has been instrumental in some of their personnel decisions.\n\nAI\u2019s influence on sport was one of the topics discussed at the NRL\u2019s Business of Sport Conference in Las Vegas at the University of Nevada, just before this year\u2019s season-opening matches at Allegiant Stadium. The headline speakers were Driussi and Paul Devlin, the latter the global strategy leader for betting, gaming and sports technology at Amazon Web Services. Devlin, who has held high-performance roles at the Brisbane Broncos, South Sydney, Parramatta and Melbourne Storm, said AI would transform the sporting landscape. AI is being used extensively in the NFL. Credit: AP \u201cWe see AI as absolutely revolutionary, and we think it will impact every area of business in the future,\u201d Devlin says. \u201cSo everybody should be experimenting with it right now, so that was kind of the key message that came out of that NRL event ... AI is going to improve every area of business, but it is really clear on the insight generation from the data side of it in a sport like rugby league on talent identification, load monitoring, safety of the games through simulations, as well as the fan side of sport as well.\u201d\n\nSeveral NRL clubs are already dabbling with AI. One leading head coach, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect the club\u2019s intellectual property, said that AI had the potential to help analysts wade through reams of data to come up with a couple of key takeaways when preparing for an opponent. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see the next step in world sport, how AI can save you time in identifying those trends so you\u2019re not wasting time doing it yourself,\u201d the coach says. \u201cThe advantage you get is saving man-hours, so you actually spend less time on computers and more with the players. \u201cYou can see the information that\u2019s relevant; missed tackles is the most outdated stat because there\u2019s no context to it. And completion rates; seven of the top-10 completing teams didn\u2019t make the finals last year.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a practical example of how AI is being used. One club found the best way to beat the Storm is to limit their time in possession. If you can restrict them to less than 23 minutes and 25 seconds with the football \u2013 they average 26 minutes and 36 seconds \u2013 you have an almost 100 per cent chance of winning. Not easy to do in reality, but it\u2019s useful information. While most NRL teams focus heavily on pre-contact metres \u2013 the distance gained before first defensive contact \u2013 to build momentum, a different focus is required to beat Canberra. AI found the Raiders were uniquely driven by post-contact metres, those tough yards gained after contact. Limit those metres, and you can stop the Green Machine. AI has already identified at least one way to try to stop the Melbourne Storm. Credit: Getty Images Canterbury\u2019s embracing of AI reflects a broader transformation sweeping through professional sport worldwide. American sports leagues are leading the charge, with the NFL processing more than 500 million data points per season through its Digital Athlete system, reducing player injuries by 700 missed games since 2023. Major League Baseball has implemented AI for pitching analysis and injury prevention, while the NBA uses machine learning for player load management and game strategy optimisation. English Premier League clubs are using AI for recruitment: Brighton\u2019s system identified Moises Caicedo before his eventual \u00a3115 million ($240 million) transfer from them to Chelsea, while Liverpool\u2019s partnership with Google DeepMind has produced tactical analysis tools that club experts prefer over traditional methods 90 per cent of the time.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Canterbury\u2019s AI implementation is understandable given the competitive implications; NRL clubs are notoriously protective of innovations that might provide advantages. The technological investment aligns with the Bulldogs\u2019 recent restructure. The blue and whites are constructing a $50 million centre of excellence at Belmore and have significantly expanded their pathways programs, including taking over the Fiji Silktails program. Major League Baseball has implemented AI for pitching analysis. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWe\u2019re building for long-term success,\u201d Driussi says. \u201cThat means investing in the best people, the best facilities and the best technology available to us.\u201d Bulldogs chief executive Aaron Warburton confirmed the club\u2019s commitment to innovation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking at ways to improve our operations and give our players and staff the best possible tools to succeed,\u201d Warburton says. \u201cTechnology is certainly part of that equation.\u201d Loading The club\u2019s return to finals football last year, after missing the post-season for eight seasons, has been attributed to improved recruitment, player development and coaching. However, the role of AI in this transformation remains largely hidden. Given the global AI sports market is tipped to grow from $1.2 billion to nearly $30 billion by 2032, getting in early could be the key to success. Already, rivals are playing catch-up to Canterbury. For a club that has endured wooden spoons and years of mediocrity, the Bulldogs are marrying old-school values with cutting-edge technology. Whether that translates to premiership glory remains to be seen, but the Bulldogs are betting heavily that the future of rugby league will be shaped by artificial intelligence.",

Usually, we see problems of mould in warehouses and in other collections. But due to global warming, it is expected that more and more insect infestations will appear.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drugstore beetle, also known as the bread beetle, is often found among foodstuffs like grains, flour, spices, and other dried products.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut they are also attracted to the gelatine and starch-based adhesives found in old books.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Hajdu believes the effects of climate change have played a role in spurring the beetle infestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Higher temperatures are favourable for the life of insects. They are quite inactive below 20 degrees Celsius. Below that, their activity slows down; above that, they\u2019re more active. The persistently greater heat leads to more life cycles per year than in cooler periods. In warmer conditions, the reproduction cycle of the drugstore beetle can be up to four per year compared to only two in cooler weather.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beetle invasion was first detected during a routine cleaning of the library, when employees noticed unusual layers of dust on the shelves and then saw that holes had been burrowed into some of the book spines.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon opening the volumes, burrow holes could be seen in the paper where the beetles had chewed through.\n\n\n\n\n\nIlona \u00c1sv\u00e1nyi says everyone is heartbroken at the prospect of losing books because of the infestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I see a book chewed up by a beetle or infested in any other way, I feel that no matter how many copies are published and how replaceable the book is, a piece of culture has been lost.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Abbey's restoration workers are trying hard to avoid that possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're removing roughly 100,000 hand-bound books from the shelves and carefully placing them in crates.\n\n\n\n\n\nZs\u00f3fia Hajdu says so many books are being taken down because the infestation has been detected in several parts of the library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an advanced insect infestation which has been detected in several parts of the library, so the entire collection is classified as infected and must be treated all at the same time. We have to remove all the books from the shelves, put them into boxes, then into hermetically sealed plastic sacks. Inside them, an anoxic disinfection process takes place. Basically, we create an oxygen-free environment in which insects perish.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce that process is done - and before being reshelved - each book will be individually inspected and vacuumed, and any book damaged by the pests will be set aside for later restoration work.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Dutch rider Thymen Arensman won the Tour de France's toughest stage after a long solo effort over mammoth climbs but Tadej Pogacar increased his overall lead on Sunday AEST.\n\n\n\n\n\nArensman, who rides for Ineos-Grenadiers, posted the biggest victory of his career. After crossing the finish line in the deep fog enveloping the ski resort of Superbagneres, Arensman lay exhausted on the road with his head in his hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe went solo with 37km left from a breakaway, and quickly opened a comfortable lead. He started the final ascent to Superbagneres, which is more than 12km long, on his own and resisted the return of the main contenders.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was Arensman's second Grand Tour stage win, having previously won a stage at the 2022 Spanish Vuelta.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Arensman posed no threat to the overall standings, Pogacar and his teammates controlled the race from the back. The yellow jersey holder and his main challenger, Jonas Vingegaard, trailed by around three minutes with 8km remaining.\n\n\n\nVingegaard tried a move with 4km left but Pogacar responded with ease. The two rivals then watched each other closely and Arensman crossed first at the summit, more than one minute ahead of the duo.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving won the previous two stages in the Pyrenees, Pogacar settled for second place. He accelerated in the final section to gain more time on Vingegaard, who completed the podium.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Pogacar increased his lead over Vingegaard to 4 minutes, 13 seconds, with Florian Lipowitz in third place, 7:53 off the pace after Remco Evenepoel abandoned his race.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvenepoel, who was third overall, struggled early on as the peloton faced another day of suffering on climbs that are part of the Tour's lore such as the Col du Tourmalet, the Col d'Aspin, Col de Peyresourde and Superbagneres.\n\n\n\nThe Olympic champion was dropped on the ascent of the Tourmalet. Evenepoel won the stage five time trial but suffered in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter struggling during Friday's uphill race against the clock to Peyragudes, he managed to keep his third place in the general classification.\n\n\n\n\n\nBen O'Connor was the highest finishing Australian rider, in 16th place, with Callum Scotson 19th. O'Connor is in 12th position overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a spectator was hit by a car from the Ineos-Grenadiers team on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTV footage showed the team car knocking down the fan, who was holding what looked liked a mobile phone, close to the top of the Col de Peyresourde.\n\n\n\nThe vehicle was following riders on the steep ascent and driving at moderate speed. There was no immediate information available on the spectator's condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race jury later said Ineos-Grenadiers sports director Oliver Cookson was fined the equivalent of just under A$10,000 for \"improper behaviour endangering spectators\" and handed a yellow card. Accumulating yellow cards over a defined period of time results in a suspension.\n\n\n\n\n\nIneos-Grenadiers apologised \"to the fan who was accidentally and regretfully struck by one of our race cars while supporting the riders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like all teams we take great care to maintain a safe race environment for everyone, including the passionate fans who make our sport so special.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRiders will leave the high mountains on Sunday's stage during a 169km ride from Muret to the medieval city of Carcassonne.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race finishes next weekend in Paris.\n\n\n\n",

So I thought it was incredible that there was a trade before colonisation and you can actually record it. So why not try and recreate it?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Malgana Traditional Owner Michael Wear.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe heads an Indigenous-owned business which is reviving the ancient industry. Tidal Moon draws on traditional knowledge to harvest sea cucumbers sustainably.\n\n\n\nHand-picked, one by one, the marine animal will soon be dried and processed at a brand-new export facility in the West Australian town of Denham. And then they're sent to a Singaporean partner for export across South East Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTidal Moon also has its sights set on Western markets, with emerging research highlighting the potential health benefits of the marine animals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hope is that as the business scales up, so too will employment opportunities in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The lack of indigenous people in the commercial fishing industry is so, so unfortunate. If you can create a business that's sustainable, that's culturally directed, you can create jobs and a middle class within small coastal towns.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2017, the company has trained around a dozen Indigenous divers, including 28 year old Malgana and Amangu man Alex Dodd - the company's lead diver\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tidal Moon, what it's actually doing is making that middle class ground so people can move back home and have jobs and then buy a house, settle down with their family and kids up here and move back home. A lot of the time you get young fellas that grow up here and then they're moving away going to the mines or going to Perth or something like that because it's not sustainable for them to work here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nConservation is also at the heart of the business\n\n\n\nGathaagudu is home to the planet's largest reserve of seagrass both a food source for marine life and a carbon storage powerhouse\n\n\n\nBut more than a quarter was razed in a marine heatwave in 2011, and it's still recovering while also grappling with a new heatwave. In February, the waters were four degrees warmer than usual.\n\n\n\nTidal Moon is leading one of the world's largest seagrass restoration projects. While scouring the seafloor for sea cucumbers, the divers also replant seagrass reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the key things that we're trying to do is keep the carbon captured in the sea floor. So without seagrass restoration, you have these carbon bombs that go off and there's about 40 million tons of CO2 that are at risk in Shark Bay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team have also catalogued over 4000 hours of footage \u2013 a 'living library' of marine observations noticing a symbiotic relationship between the seagrass and sea cucumbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Verduin, a marine scientist at Perth\u2019s Murdoch University, agrees that the relationship might be \u201cmutually beneficial,\u201d saying sea cucumbers are 'the worms of the ocean.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The function of sea cucumbers overturning the soil and redistributing nutrients. It's very good to get those nutrients in within the sediment. So it's good for the seagrasses and they grow better. But seagrasses, in turn, also then protect the sea cucumbers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says Tidal Moon\u2019s divers, have a \u201ccareful\u201d and \u201ccircular\u201d way of approaching marine conservation.\n\n",

Source: SBS News But wage growth over a similar period has not kept pace, which has put extra strain on families. Wages in NSW grew by 131.1 per cent between September 1997 and March 2025.\n\n\n\nWages growth in Australia has failed to keep pace with the increased cost of housing. Source: SBS News\n\nWomen are more likely to work now\n\nSocial researcher Mark McCrindle points out that women in their early 30s \u2014 an age when many would be having children \u2014 are now twice as likely to be working compared to their own mothers at the same age.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explains: \"77 per cent of women in their early 30s are in the labour force \u2014 it was less than a third a generation ago.\"\n\n\n\nEmployment for women aged in their 30s once dropped sharply but now it barely dips. Source: SBS News Based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Time Use Survey, conducted between November 2020 and July 2021, McCrindle notes that a third of Australians also report feeling rushed or pressed for time often or always.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 38 per cent of women reported this, and 32 per cent of men.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen aged 35 to 44 years were the group most likely to report feeling rushed for time (55 per cent).\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Cheryll tried to get pregnant for years. One thing sealed her decision to stop\n\nMcCrindle says working from home is seen as a way of reducing that stress or time pressure, as workplaces are traditionally located in CBDs well away from where people live, and where schools, childcare, shopping and other family and social connections are located.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rising cost of housing has pushed people even further away from workplaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only way to really make all of that work is to have less time conducting that commute, and that's where I think work from home achieves that,\" McCrindle says.\n\n\n\nWork from home has become a lifeline for parents\n\nYusuf, whose daughter is now seven years old, has been promoted to the senior leadership team at her work, and says her experiences motivated her to support flexibility for employees returning from maternity leave, so they can return to work in a way that makes them comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[There's] no clock watching, so you're not making sure people arrive at a certain time or leave at a certain time,\" she says.\n\n\n\nI've heard of businesses saying you need to prove that you've got child care \u2014 somebody in the house helping you with the child \u2014 in order to be paid for this day of work.\n\n\"We don't do anything like that because we just know that our people will make it work.,\" Yusuf says.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hopes flexible work arrangements will ultimately enable women to take on leadership roles while still allowing them to be the parents they aspire to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know a lot of women in senior roles who have the house husband or the au pair, but I don't want to miss out on that time with my child,\" she says.\n\n\n\nEb Yusuf is ambitious about her career but doesn't want to miss out on spending time with her daughter. Source: Supplied Yusuf's heard messages directed towards women that if they want to be a boss or CEO, they need to be in the office.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she points out she has a vested interest in the business performing well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've worked in this business for nearly five years.

This is horrible'.\n\nCullimore, who found a part-time role closer to home in the finance department of a media company, says being allowed to work remotely meant her family could make a life-changing move from Sydney to Port Stephens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can take my dog for a walk in the morning, the kids get on the bus [just outside my house], I'm here in the afternoon when the kids get home [and] I can make dinner,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can jump on and off online depending on my work schedule, and I just love my life so much more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe arrangement is also beneficial for her employers as she logs in every day, even though she has a part-time role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I had to go into the office, I would definitely go in for the three days only,\" she says.\n\n\n\nKerrie Cullimore loves her life after working from home enabled her family to move to Port Stephens.

It enables older workers to help out with grandkids and those who are neurodivergent to participate in the workplace more fully.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may also help parents who don't want to put their children in childcare to manage care with help from grandparents or extended family while continuing to work. Mothers may also be able to breastfeed for a longer period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The bigger picture has to be beyond purely GDP [gross domestic product] measures to the other social measures of wellbeing, social fabric, engaged family, and investment in the next generation,\" McCrindle says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any flexible practices that can help accommodate that, I think, is an investment in the future.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "When Zac Altman returned to Australia, he didn't expect that a frustrating journey trying to get rediagnosed with ADHD would propel him to start a business seeking to address the flaws of the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nAltman is the founder of Kantoko, a telehealth platform that offers ADHD assessment and care under a subscription model. After being diagnosed with ADHD while living in the United States, he returned home \u2014 and found he needed to start his diagnosis journey from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was already diagnosed, already on the medication, had the documentation. I thought it was going to be pretty straightforward. And for me, it was a challenge,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think I ever would've made it through the process if I were starting in Australia from the get-go because of the massive hurdles and burdens required with getting through the process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAltman's struggles reflect a broader issue when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in Australia: despite rising awareness and demand, the system is still playing catch-up \u2014 and some states are lagging behind.\n\n\n\nZac Altman says he would never have founded his ADHD telehealth business if he hadn't struggled with the diagnosis process himself. Source: Supplied\n\nA postcode lottery\n\nAll states and territories have different laws governing how stimulant medications \u2014 commonly prescribed to treat ADHD \u2014 can be prescribed and dispensed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some places, the process is more streamlined. In others, patients face stricter regulatory barriers \u2014 often accompanied by longer wait times and higher costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Roger Paterson, a psychiatrist based in Western Australia, said there was \"always a postcode privilege for all levels of healthcare\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ADHD treatment is no different,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said ADHD diagnosis and treatment rates have surged in Australia \u2014 but not uniformly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're still below the prevalence rates \u2026 but some states and territories have caught up quicker than others.\" Paterson told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatterson said South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and the Northern Territory remain the slowest to catch up, while Western Australia \u2014 which once lagged behind \u2014 has now reached similar levels to Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No-one really knows why [some states lag], beyond the NT not having many specialists \u2014 paediatricians or psychiatrists. But they are all gradually catching up to the ADHD prevalence rates.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevalence refers to the proportion of a population that is affected by ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are no Australian adult prevalence studies of ADHD using the current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, some studies have indicated the prevalence of ADHD in Australia is likely to be similar to that found internationally \u2014 between 2 and 6 per cent of the population, according to the Australasian ADHD Professionals Association.\n\n\n\nRates of prescribing vary across states and territories, reflecting the different jurisdictional laws about stimulant prescribing. Source: SBS News Additionally, the federal government's Drug Utilisation Sub Committee September 2023 report found differences in the rates of prescribing across states and territories, which the report says reflects different laws across jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdult rates of prescribing were significantly higher in Western Australia and the ACT compared to the other states and the Northern Territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal Senate inquiry into ADHD, handed down in November 2023, examined the barriers to consistent, timely and best-practice assessment of ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt heard those living in regional and rural areas were subject to even more barriers to care, with reduced access to specialists, longer wait times and higher costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAltman said the differences were most pronounced in Kantoko clients moving interstate who had to navigate different jurisdictional regulations, sometimes requiring them to find an entirely new specialist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seems somewhat unreasonable to expect every psychiatrist to know every quirk across the country ... which is why I would argue we should have some sort of national standard around this stuff,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA patchwork system with no national rules\n\nAltman said going through the assessment process in Australia can feel like \"a roll of the dice\" due to a lack of national rules.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he paid about $1,500 out of pocket to be rediagnosed in his first year back in Australia \u2014 including an upfront $1,000 fee to secure a psychiatrist appointment in NSW. He said he was fortunate to have leftover medication from the US to tide him over in the months he waited, but he knows others aren't so lucky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the luck of the draw,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry heard that of those who did have positive experiences of ADHD assessment and diagnosis, \"many attributed their experience to luck\" or to doctors and psychiatrists who helped them access services.\n\n\n\nThere is no national framework for ADHD, despite it being a key recommendation in the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry heard wait times were found to be \"significant\", typically between six and 18 months for an initial appointment, while the Australian Association of Psychologists Inc said the number of mental health professionals has not kept up with the demand for services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe public system rarely treats the condition except in children, pushing adults seeking a diagnosis to the private sector. As specialists set their own fees with no cap, people can be subject to high fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ADHD Foundation said it had observed some professionals charge up to $5,000 for assessments.\n\n\n\n'Kantoko wouldn't exist if Australia nailed it'\n\nIn response, ADHD telehealth services like Kantoko have cropped up. Operating completely online, these clinics promise shorter wait times \u2014 but sometimes at a greater cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nKantoko operates under a subscription model. Medicare does not cover any fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn exchange, patients are promised an ADHD assessment by a qualified psychiatrist, follow-up appointments with mental health doctors and prescription renewals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kantoko wouldn't exist if Australia had nailed it,\" Altman said. \"I wouldn't have gotten so frustrated that I started this business and embarked on this journey if it were easy-to-access and affordable.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Autism and ADHD frequently overlap. People living with both can feel misunderstood\n\nBut the Senate inquiry heard concerns about the growing telehealth service model, saying that while it was helpful for those in regional areas, it has also driven up risks associated with \"inadequate assessment and misdiagnosis\", according to the Australian College of Mental Health Nurses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Canberra and Queanbeyan ADHD Support Group, a volunteer-run local group, said the clinics offered \"exceedingly high fees delivering a quick turnaround\" with concerns of \"price gouging\".\n\n\n\nThe GP debate: solving shortages or lowering the bar?\n\nAs the system plays catch-up, a key recommendation from the inquiry was the development of uniform and nationally consistent ADHD prescribing rules \u2014 the only recommendation of the 15 that the government accepted in full.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the government said the establishment of prescribing arrangements, including increased GP involvement, was a matter for state and territory governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSW, ACT, SA and WA have committed to reforms that will allow specially trained GPs to prescribe ADHD medication independently from 2025 and 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey'll join jurisdictions like Queensland, where GPs have been able to prescribe certain ADHD medications for children without prior approval since 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some say it could ease bottlenecks and encourage holistic care, others warn it risks lowering the standards of care.\n\n\n\nPaterson said the current model is for specialists to handle diagnosis and stabilisation, before shifting to a shared care arrangement with GPs \u2014 known as co-prescribing. He's sceptical of political moves to shift ADHD treatment onto GPs in an effort to play catch-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some GPs have pushed for taking on initial, independent assessment and prescribing, and politicians push this along as a popular way of reducing waiting lists,\" Paterson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This creates a tension between reducing waitlists with more GP involvement on the one hand, but on the other hand, accepting that GP ADHD management may not have the nuance of specialist management.\"\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that relaxing GP restrictions could open the door to so-called 'dexy clinics' \u2014 where stimulant medications such as dexamphetamines might be handed out too freely, similar to concerns seen with medicinal cannabis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There would be less concern about lower GP numbers who are highly trained, and more concern about higher GP numbers who are less trained,\" Paterson said. \"The worst case scenario is that stimulant medication becomes as accessible as cannabis from the medicinal cannabis clinics.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Alison Poulton, a senior lecturer in paediatrics at The University of Sydney and member of ADHD Australia's advisory board, pushed back against 'dexy clinic' fears, saying that ongoing relationships between GPs and patients would reduce risk and encourage more holistic care.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe criticised current restrictions requiring specialist endorsement and fixed dosage limits, arguing they undermine both patient autonomy and the ability of GPs to tailor care.\n\n\n\n\"It makes complete nonsense of patient autonomy,\" she said. \"Decisions should be made between the GP and patient, not based on a letter written five years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPoulton emphasised that GPs, who often have a long-term understanding of their patients, are well placed to make prescribing decisions that reflect changing needs, leading to better functional outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the GPs are going to do a much better job if they know it's up to them to make these prescribing decisions rather than to have to consult the specialist.\"\n\n\n\n",

I know Tasmanians did not want an election - but Dean Winter caused this election with his desperation and his immaturity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday's poll was the second in 16 months for the state, and the fourth in seven years, called after the minority Liberal Premier Jeremy Rockliff lost a parliamentary no-confidence motion in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps keen to get it out of the way, more than 100,000 people voted early - about a quarter of Tasmania's 412,000 enrolled voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor leader Dean Winter though has maintained the Premier brought the election on himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The person who drove to Government House to call an election was Jeremy Rockliff. The person who caused this election was Jeremy Rockliff. He stubbornly refused to resign when the parliament didn't have confidence in him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential AFL stadium appears to have loomed large as an issue with voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal for the $945 million waterfront venue in Hobart has been opposed by parts of the community, the Greens, several crossbenchers - and Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I love AFL, Tasmania loves AFL, but it shouldn't come at the cost of future generations of Tasmanians. So there needs to be a pathway through that doesn't mean Macquarie Point stadium.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, both major parties have supported the idea, and some Tasmanians have also been keen.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAN: \"Very important. No, it'll be great for everything, the economy, the kids, the footy. Yeah, it'll be good.\"\n\n\n\nWOMAN: \"It will completely help Tasmania. We need it, our economy needs it, and it's great for the kids.\"\n\n\n\nWOMAN: \"Because we need one in Tassie.\"\n\n\n\nMAN: \"And the economic benefits.\"\n\n\n\nDISTANT VOICE: \"We need jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been other concerns too, besides the budget and cost of living pressures - from multicultural communities like the Nepalese diaspora worried about a spate of harassment and vandalism incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Santosh Adhikari is the Regional (North) Lead for the Children\u2019s University Tasmania, and the founding president of the Nepali Society of Northern Tasmania (NSNT).\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has told SBS Nepali many have wondered about the response of authorities to these incidents in such a volatile political climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's definitely been affecting the community to grow in any place, like when the government is not stable. For example, it takes a long time to make relationships with the politicians and the policymakers. So if the government changes so frequently it is hard to build a relationship and advocate on behalf of the community to the politicians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appetite for political calm though is unlikely to be satisfied after this election.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll opinion polls before the polls opened pointed to neither the Liberals nor Labor boosting their support enough to reach the 18-seat mark required for majority government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberals held 14 seats, Labor 10, while the Greens held five and the remaining six were either independents or other parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far the Liberals have defied expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, that means the government is on track to keep all of their existing seats and perhaps pick up more while Labor could struggle to retain all of theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Labor leader has suggested they would try to govern in minority even if they finish with fewer seats than the Liberals.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those Liberal seats has been claimed by former Coalition MP Bridget Archer, who lost her federal electorate seat in the last federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Canberra, Ms Archer garnered attention for crossing the floor to vote against her own party several times - something she has already flagged she was keen on continuing in state politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to be anybody's stooge or anybody's puppet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Rockliff has also drawn a line in the sand.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has indicated he will not do any deals with the Greens to govern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We cannot risk going back to the dark old days of a Labor Green government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn official result may be weeks away because of postal votes still to arrive, but counting suggests the incumbent government's vote has risen and Labor's has collapsed.\n\n\n\n",

It's a good place to retire and what you heard from my husband, it's stress free, no time for anything, very relaxed lifestyle over there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLaleiga's husband Tupa shares the same dream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The plan was to come and work, when the kids grow up, we'd retire in Tuvalu. But yeah, hopefully it's still there when we retire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe family is concerned about the future prospect of returning to Tuvalu because the tiny Pacific nation is being swallowed by rising oceans due to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Australia and Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union - a landmark climate and security pact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a groundbreaking agreement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's opened a visa pathway to Australia for people like Laliega's family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am very excited.

I'm trying got get all of them over, I just feel I would love to have a sibling, a sister, closer with me here, next to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n280 Tuvalu citizens will be granted permanent residency each year as part of the landmark pact.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust over 5,100 [[5,157]] applications have now been made - more than half of the nation's estimated population - with the lottery having closed on the 18th of July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's half of Tuvalu's population.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome have speculated the entire population of the Pacific Island of Tuvalu could live in Australia within forty years if demand for a new visa lottery holds - but Pacific Minister Pat Conroy says unlike a lot of permanent resident visas, Tuvalans have a lot of freedom of movement back to Tuvalu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a world's first approach to a relationship between two countries. We're responding to a request from the Tuvaluan goverment for migration with dignity. And so we do envision that a fair number of Tuvalans will come to Australia out of a population of around 11,000.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTuvalu says it's keen for its citizens to have a home to come back to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Labor approved a 50 year extension of the North West Shelf gas project which will emit 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Tuvalu's Climate Minister Maina Vakafua Talia has been among those asking the federal government to do more to curb emissions .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Opening and subsidising and exporting fossil fuels is immoral and unacceptable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Conroy says Australia remains a conscientious neighbour, mindful of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says there are also other considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\nSara: \"How do you explain that to Pacific leaders?\"\n\n\n\nConroy: \"Well I think that instance is an example of how we do diplomacy. We seek to partner not gag, which is not a claim every other country can make.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a not so subtle reference to China, which also offers aid, infrastructure and security partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration pathways are seen as one area where Beijing can't compete - as Ryan Edwards from the ANU Development Policy Centre says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia is just a remarkably more attractive place to live. We already do have the historical ties, we've got a vibrant diaspora, a small one - but we do have that community here. It's just very different. And so it makes a lot of sense for them to use that as the avenue for strengthening realtionships and engagement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater labour mobility is something Pacific leaders have long called for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has responded with a Pacific Engagement Visa, which also offers permanent residency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm really focused on making sure those first three thousand settle visa grantees have the best possible experience of coming to Australia, and then we'll just see where the numbers go but at the moment our policy is 3,000 places a year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the transition can be difficult - as Laleiga well knows.\n\n\n\n",

That will be an interesting experience!!!\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit comes as Trump faces increased scrutiny about his relationship with Epstein , the disgraced financier and sex offender who died in a New York jail cell in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York City's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein had taken his own life, but this conclusion has been disputed, with many believing he was murdered.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Epstein case has generated conspiracy theories that became popular among Trump's base of supporters who believed the government was covering up Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful.\n\n\n\nSome of Trump's most loyal followers became furious after his administration reversed course on its promise to release files related to the Epstein investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Justice Department memo released on 7 July concluded that Epstein killed himself and said there was \"no incriminating client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent people.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Pam Bondi had pledged months earlier to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including \"a lot of names\" and \"a lot of flight logs\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWith pressure to release the Epstein files building, Trump on Thursday said he directed Bondi to ask a court to release grand jury testimony about Epstein.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US government on Friday filed a motion in Manhattan federal court to unseal those grand jury transcripts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice said the criminal cases against Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell are a matter of public interest, justifying the release of associated grand jury transcripts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Journal said the letter bearing Trump's name was part of a leather-bound birthday book for Epstein that included messages from other high-profile people.\n\n\n\nThe newspaper said the letter contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newspaper said the letter concludes \"Happy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret,\" and featured the signature \"Donald.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegations that Epstein had been sexually abusing girls became public in 2006 \u2014 after the birthday book was produced \u2014 and he was arrested that year before accepting a plea deal.\n\n\n\nEpstein died in 2019 in jail after he was arrested for a second time and charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, who was photographed with Epstein multiple times in social situations in the 1990s and early 2000s, told reporters in 2019 that he ended his relationship with Epstein long before his legal troubles became apparent.\n\n\n\n",

I was planning to go all in from start to finish and that's what I did,\" Poga\u010dar said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar won the Tour de France in 2020, 2021 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar had a sticker of the Hulk comic book superhero on his bike but said after the stage his hero was Spider-Man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hulk though, he's the one you don't want to make angry,\" said Poga\u010dar.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time he finished stage 13 at the Peyragudes Altiport where the opening scene of the James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies was shot, Poga\u010dar was 36 seconds faster than Vingegaard, while Primoz Roglic was third at 1min 20sec.\n\n\n\nDanish rider Jonas Vingegaard cycles during the 13th stage of the 112th edition of the Tour de France cycling race. Source: AFP / Anne-Christine Poujoulat Evenepoel was overtaken close to the line by Vingegaard, but said he was too tired to care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was drained,\" he said, slumped in a chair. \"I didn't give a damn when Jonas went past.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just wanted to finish. To be honest I'm relieved it's over,\" said the double Olympic champion.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost riders warmed up for the time trial wearing ice jackets to combat the sizzling 30C temperature at the foot of the climb.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian champion Luke Plapp set the early pace and sat in the hot seat all day before suddenly packing his case and vacating it on seeing Vingegaard storm up the mountain.\n\n\n\nPoga\u010dar was even faster.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1580m altitude the ride remained beneath the clouds and below the treeline, but even atop the hill it was punishingly hot.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Quinn Simmons gave hundreds of high-fives on the home straight as one of the rare riders appearing to enjoy the climb.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday's stage 14 is another punishing affair with around 50km of climbing but it will likely be raced in rain.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt starts with the famous Col de Tourmalet and ends at the Luchon-Superbagneres ski resort.\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 15 is a hilly run to the walled city of Carcassonne but for Poga\u010dar there remains the spectre of three more massive mountain stages in the final week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also the prospect of potential chaos in Paris with three ascents of Montmartre's old cobbled lanes on the final day.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it's memories of singing or playing the recorder, learning music can begin at an early age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, it depends who you ask but there is a famous quote by a Hungarian ethnomusicologist, composer and educator (Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly) who said 9 months before the birth of the mother (is the age to begin music learning). So I think that sums it up quite nicely. It is never too young. But of course it needs to be age and developmentally appropriate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Dr Jason Goopy, a researcher and a music educator who has spent 15 years teaching in Australian primary and secondary schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has been trying to connect the dots - and figure out the role that music learning can play in supporting the wellbeing of young people.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the ages of five to 25 - what impact does engagement with music have when it comes to aspects of wellbeing, including emotional regulation, building relationships and promoting positive mental health?\n\n\n\n\n\nSifting through the research, he helped to identify 423 sources which were then whittled down even further - to keep the research goal in focus.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia and the UK emerged as the key countries where the most work has been done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well what is really interesting is that this is an emerging field. And we did actually do an international scoping review of all the literature globally, but predominantly research is currently situated in Australia and the UK. And that is obviously something that as a global community and a scholarly community - it needs addressing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there were clear trends that emerged from his review, published in the peer-reviewed journal Research Studies in Music Education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The motivation behind this study wasn't necessarily to look at how to create professional musicians. It was how can we be our best selves through learning music. And so the benefits that we're seeing relate to social confidence. Relate to healthy relationships, relate to social cohesion, emotional regulation, identity development. There are also educational benefits, in terms of accomplishment and achievement. And these kind of benefits that are experienced through music we found are directly transferable to other aspects of life. And to those who are most vulnerable in the community, we found that they benefit the most. Achievement in music can translate to achievement in other areas of life very easily.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review also pointed to the factors that make a music learning program effective for the wellbeing outcomes of young people - across different settings, whether in a school or as a community initiative.\n\n\n\n\n\nTailored and bespoke programs were particularly effective at targeting certain population groups like Indigenous youths, those with a disability; or others from a refugee or migrant background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is quite a mix within this scoping review - and they include people who are disengaged in schools, to those who are struggling to connect with the current schooling system. There are also those who are experiencing mental health challenges. There is also included in the study - also music in prisons for young people who are incarcerated and in contact with the criminal justice system. So the whole range of contexts that we have engaged within this particular study, which is why we wanted to go beyond school. Because music is having a powerful influence even beyond school, in the community. But yes, we're finding yes, it's characteristics and properties of music that is making a difference - but also the social aspects of doing music. Music is fundamentally a social practice - and coming together to make music, even beyond listening to music we're finding is having substantial benefits to individuals and their communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of music to help support young people to thrive is something that Dom Brook is deeply acquainted with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you get it into shaping your story and having a voice especially for a young person or adolescent who haven't find their purpose or voice, music or lyric writing helps you with your emotions. It helps you have a voice a suppose. Find your sense of purpose and move through some of those maybe troubling emotions - and make sense of them. Music is the counsellor for that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the age of 17, a second-hand guitar played an important role in helping him to get through some tough times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had an upbringing that was all over the place and no father figure. Quite poor. It was the next door neighbour that believed in me. He was throwing out a guitar and wanted to give it to someone who would use it. And it was at that point that I was just getting into finding my voice through music very late in the picture. Never did music in school. So I was about 16, 17. And I paid for a songwriting camp for me to go to. And this camp was one of those lifechanging moments that I came back from this camp knowing that I wanted the voice that I had found, the purpose that I found through music. Something was just sparked inside of me to help others - and change lives through music.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 20 years ago, he decided to do that with a youth mentoring program, Musicians Making a Difference - also known by its acronym MMAD.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe in-person outreach is in New South Wales and Queensland, with online programs extending access nationally.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the mission is to help at-risk youth find their future direction - whether that be in music or in fields like journalism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Young people out of juvenile justice refuges, kids that are homeless. Kids even from pretty good families, but they're sorting out stuff. But I would say the majority are at-risk young people. We create this special environment where at MMAD it's family. And where there is freedom from judgement. There is no judgement. It is a place they can be themselves. It is a place where they can find their childlike self again. And find confidence in that and then go onto make their lives remarkable. The funny thing about MMAD is our vision is to see have every young person have someone who believes in them. And we use music because it is such a powerful tool to be able to breakdown those barriers and find what is special about young people - and their journey.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe work has been transformative for graduates like Daniel Harvey, these days known by the stage name D Minor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe musical artist found a knack for writing rap lyrics - a skill that was honed when he joined the program at the age of 14.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time he was referred by a youth counsellor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had been through so much at that stage. Foster care, refuge system, being a state ward. And not having a sense of belonging or feeling accepted anywhere. And then meeting MMAD just feeling like I belong someone, feeling that there was a bigger, purpose for me. Just having someone who believes in you - and being able to share my music. Having someone to encourage me through that process. And kind of use that music as a tool and outlet to overcome some hurt and pain, yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat included communicating his experience of being homeless at the age of 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it took him on stage to audition for Australia's Got Talent in 2019, with an original song entitled 'Concrete Pillow'.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat took him in the direction of continuing to cultivate his skills in storytelling.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the impact it has had on him is almost beyond words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If someone can listen to my music and they can feel like okay, they can overcome something. I should be able to share that (my story). And that for me is incredible. And especially, when there is a message behind it to raise awareness of the situation. It is quite big - and not something that I ever imagined. But the journey has been incredible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Jason Goopy, the early experiences people have with music are incredibly powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the potential in supporting people to thrive has yet to be fully realised.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a cosy apartment in Sydney\u2019s west, Vibha Gulati is looking at photos of her late mother, Bhusan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was an amazing person. She was very compassionate, very loving, very hospitable to people who came to the house.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA migrant from India, Bhusan Gulati was 87 when she was diagnosed with a life-limiting illness.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a terrible shock for Vibha who had lived with her mother for 35 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The doctors said she had ovarian cancer and that she had less about six months to live. It was shocking. It was really shocking. I was losing my best friend. We loved each other very much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the diagnosis, Bhusan Gulati refused medical treatment and chose voluntary assisted dying at home in the care of her daughters, Prabha and Vibha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was important for her. She advocated for voluntary assisted dying. She wanted control over her death and the whole process of her illness. She did not want any chemo or radiation. Surgery was posed as an option, but that was also refused. She could manage herself quite well. She was just ill during the last week, she was going out to cafes restaurants till the week she passed away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVibha Gulati says a mix of Buddhist, Hindu and spiritual beliefs helped to farewell her mother in December last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had chanting here while she was passing away. So we had Indian chants, which are Indian mantras infused with spiritual energy. It creates a very calming effect on the mind and on the emotions as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile faith has supported Vibha Gulati through her loss, the grief remains raw and is, at times, hard to bear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My spiritual belief gives me strength, trust that I will meet her again and that she has not gone forever. I can feel her presence around me sometimes. So it's really, really lovely. But that loss is still there and I think it takes a lot of time to get used to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one reason she turned to an online support platform called the Violet Initiative, a national not-for-profit organisation that helps people navigate the last chapters of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I found out about Violet after she passed away and I had some counselling sessions online. The loss was great. It comes in waves so often that you think you're all right and then suddenly you'll be crying. I felt really understood by them. I felt they held the space very well to what I was going through. They didn't negate any feeling that I had.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVibha Gulati is not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years more than 30,000 people have accessed the service.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt offers guides and digital support, as CEO Melissa Reader explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are really trying to help families and communities be more prepared around the last stages of a person's life. People come to us saying, \u2018I just don\u2019t know where to start. My mum is in her late eighties, dad might've died a couple of years ago. I'm usually the eldest daughter stepping into that caregiving role. I'm managing my own family, work, life, career and I'm completely overwhelmed\u2019.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Australia\u2019s population ages services like Violet become more crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaring for dying people in hospital already costs around $4 billion annually, according to Violet research.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Ms Reader says that figure will rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have about 12,000 people turning 85 each year today. In five years there'll be a fivefold increase that'll be 60,000 people reaching that age each year. And our health and age care systems are at capacity today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 180,000 people die in Australia each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet Ms Reader says few have prepared a will or left clear instructions about their end-of-life choices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Up to 90 per cent of us want to be cared for at home for as long as possible with our family and our friends and everything that's familiar to us and the right services and supports. But that is not what's playing out today. So, we see people having at least four hospital admissions through the last 12 months, about 33 or 34 days, and we see one in two Australians dying in hospital. That is our least preferred place to die.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Reader knows first-hand about facing the loss of a loved one.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has raised three children since her husband died of cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was just 39 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hopes that Violet can provide the practical and personal guidance that she badly needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were completely unprepared for Mauro's death. He died in intensive care. We were totally unprepared for it and it was a very clinical and impersonal experience and quite frightening for all of us, including him. This is not an easy stage of life. It's very complex, it's very emotional and there's a lot of uncertainty.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Gibson is among Violet\u2019s 50 volunteer guides and as someone who has lived through grief and loss, she is proud to provide personal care and support for those struggling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was trying to run my own small business, a yoga studio, and then all of a sudden when my dad had just been diagnosed with dementia my life partner, Mark was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. And to say that my world flipped upside down is an understatement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was 11 years ago and the eventual death of her partner led to a life-changing decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was only 56 years old. And I decided I wanted to work as a grief and bereavement counsellor and care for people who were carers because I'd had lived experience. It was ideal. These are the conversations I want to be having. This is the help I want to be offering. I didn't ask for this to happen to me, but it did. And so I am now in that world as someone who has cared, so why not use that to help someone?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Violet platform also has an AI-enabled digital companion which offers personalised support in multiple languages.\n\n\n\n\n\nViolet\u2019s Chief Product and Technology Officer Yaniv Bernstein explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we have is a really clever, voice-based artificial intelligence agent that talks to people in the manner of a normal conversation. And this is based on thousands of hours of data that we have of experience that we have through our guided support program. People can have this conversation at any time. And what they then get is a real assessment of where they're at, what stage they're in, what their needs are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd those needs are growing.\n\n\n\n\n\nViolet Chair Kate Carnell says action is urgently needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are sleepwalking into the century's biggest economic and social crisis right at the moment. What I think we need to focus on is ensuring that people in the final stage of life get the care and attention and the dignity that they want.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs life expectancy continues to rise and the population ages, Ms Carnell says Initiatives like Violet are crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Digital technology is fundamental to having an actual solution to this problem. One-on-one approaches are important, there's no doubt and Violet provides those, but giving people access to information and feedback 24-7 by trusted sources using digital technology and AI will allow all Australians affordable access to the information that they need. And that's what Violet's focusing on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVibha Gulati and her mother Bhusan are among the few to plan their final farewell.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaring for her mother at home fulfilled her dying wish, she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was very pleased with things, and gave her a sense of peace through the whole process. And also it gave her a sense of control of her own life, which is what she advocated for her whole life and it's how she lived and that's how she passed away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Vibha Gulati has this advice for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Do what you think is best for you and your loved one and listen to your inner self and you'll know what's the best thing to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport is available through LifeLine on 13 11 14 or Griefline which provides confidential support on 1300 845 745 and via griefline.org.au\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Steven Woodburn Previous Slide Next Slide Loulou Martin Place might have just missed last week\u2019s Bastille Day celebrations, but its launch on Tuesday, July 22 is the latest instalment in a resurgence of French restaurants in the Sydney CBD. The reflective silver ceiling sparkles at the 150-seat new bistro, which sits at one of the entrances to Sydney\u2019s shiny new Metro. There are plenty of the design accoutrements you might find in a Paris bistro, including a large marble bar and patterned flooring. The new Loulou even has its own oyster and wine counter. The Martin Place restaurant is an offshoot of the northside Loulou original which opened in Milsons Point in 2021. The blue design hues of its older sister have been transplanted across the bridge, as have signature dishes such as John Dory with a champagne sauce. Loulou\u2019s lunch-special steak frites encased in a baguette. Steven Woodburn\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt joins a wave of CBD French arrivals over the past few years, including the rebooted Monopole and Manon Brasserie, and others that married French with other influences \u2013 Bistro Nido and The Charles among them. Loulou head chef Ned Parker says French food has a resonance with Sydneysiders, \u201cIt\u2019s comfort food to people, even that potato bake [everyone cooks at home] comes back to French.\u201d Parker worked in restaurants in Europe, including London\u2019s three-Michelin-starred Ledbury, before joining Loulou at Milsons Point. While Loulou aims to be an approachable bistro, the chef doesn\u2019t cut corners. The pepper sauce, for example, requires a two-day process to make the base stock. Sourdough crumpet with avocado and optional caviar. Steven Woodburn Petit Loulou, which opened downstairs in February, will supply baked goods to the new bistro for its breakfast menu. Parker says commuters will be able to start the day with a caramelised brioche, sourdough crumpet with avocado (caviar is an optional extra) or a classic omelette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring weekday happy hour (4-7pm) there will be $2 escargots and oysters, while the lunch and dinner carte lists Toulouse sausage with pomme puree, a mushroom and truffle vol-au-vent, seafood platters and French onion soup. Steak frites are having a bigger moment than usual in the CBD, with 24 York opening on July 23 and taking inspiration from Le Relais de l\u2019Entrecote in France, which has successfully leant on the dish for more than half a century. Bouillon l\u2019Entrecote at Circular Quay is another go-to venue for French-style steak and chips. Steak and many frites. Steven Woodburn \u201cOur focus won\u2019t be on steak,\u201d says Parker of the opening menu at Loulou Martin Place. However, with steak frites one of the best sellers at the Milsons Point restaurant, it still features on the menu, along with a version encased in a baguette. \u201cWe want to bring that feeling of a neighbourhood restaurant across to the city,\u201d says Parker said. Plans are underway for the brand\u2019s further expansion, too. Later this year, a fast version of Loulou Bistro will open at the Qantas Domestic Terminal at Sydney Airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreakfast and lunch Monday-Friday; dinner Monday-Saturday 1 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, loulou.sydney\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

    "text": "The sound in Brisbane was not of rage or rancour, merely one of bleak, sullen resignation. On a galling evening for the Wallabies, this stadium, traditionally such a cauldron for the hosts, felt more like a mausoleum, with home fans\u2019 despair at their team\u2019s inadequacies so all-engulfing that the hype man had to plead with them to \u201cmake some noise\u201d.\n\nAfter a 12-year wait for their players to collide with the British and Irish Lions once more, they had dared to expect some snarl and defiance befitting the occasion. But instead they witnessed a glaring mismatch, with the lack of cohesion on the pitch so painful that rare incursions into the tourists\u2019 22 were greeted with bitterly ironic cheers.\n\nAll told, the shift in atmosphere had taken just 42 minutes, with Dan Sheehan punishing an errant Australian line-out to put the Lions out of sight. At kick-off the scene on Caxton Street, on the approach to Suncorp Stadium, had been magnificent, with the seething convergence of red shirts an encapsulation of everything a Lions Test should be.\n\nThe series opener would soon curdle, though, into a grisly reckoning for Australia, whose status as the sixth-best team in the world looked flattering in the face of the Lions\u2019 bombardment and eventual 27-19 win. While their deficiencies had been well-documented, surely they would channel some snarl, some quintessential Queensland defiance, in a city that demanded it?",

    "text": "Pressed on specifics, Driussi was diplomatically vague: \u201cWe\u2019re exploring multiple AI applications, but competitive advantage comes from execution, not just ideas. The technology helps us analyse information and identify patterns that might otherwise be missed.\u201d What makes the Bulldogs\u2019 AI adoption particularly intriguing is Driussi\u2019s other role as CEO of Quantium, an Australian artificial intelligence and advanced analytics company. The firm works with major Australian companies, such as Woolworths, Commonwealth Bank, Telstra and Qantas. Bulldogs players are already benefiting from AI. Credit: Getty Images The connection provides the Bulldogs access to world-class AI expertise that would typically cost NRL clubs millions of dollars to develop themselves. While Driussi is careful not to discuss any formal arrangements, the potential for knowledge transfer is obvious. The \u201cFamily Club\u201d previously revealed it used AI to identify Jacob Preston during his recruitment from the Roosters\u2019 pathways system, suggesting the technology has been instrumental in some of their personnel decisions.\n\nAI\u2019s influence on sport was one of the topics discussed at the NRL\u2019s Business of Sport Conference in Las Vegas at the University of Nevada, just before this year\u2019s season-opening matches at Allegiant Stadium. The headline speakers were Driussi and Paul Devlin, the latter the global strategy leader for betting, gaming and sports technology at Amazon Web Services. Devlin, who has held high-performance roles at the Brisbane Broncos, South Sydney, Parramatta and Melbourne Storm, said AI would transform the sporting landscape. AI is being used extensively in the NFL. Credit: AP \u201cWe see AI as absolutely revolutionary, and we think it will impact every area of business in the future,\u201d Devlin says. \u201cSo everybody should be experimenting with it right now, so that was kind of the key message that came out of that NRL event ... AI is going to improve every area of business, but it is really clear on the insight generation from the data side of it in a sport like rugby league on talent identification, load monitoring, safety of the games through simulations, as well as the fan side of sport as well.\u201d\n\nSeveral NRL clubs are already dabbling with AI. One leading head coach, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect the club\u2019s intellectual property, said that AI had the potential to help analysts wade through reams of data to come up with a couple of key takeaways when preparing for an opponent. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see the next step in world sport, how AI can save you time in identifying those trends so you\u2019re not wasting time doing it yourself,\u201d the coach says. \u201cThe advantage you get is saving man-hours, so you actually spend less time on computers and more with the players. \u201cYou can see the information that\u2019s relevant; missed tackles is the most outdated stat because there\u2019s no context to it. And completion rates; seven of the top-10 completing teams didn\u2019t make the finals last year.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a practical example of how AI is being used. One club found the best way to beat the Storm is to limit their time in possession. If you can restrict them to less than 23 minutes and 25 seconds with the football \u2013 they average 26 minutes and 36 seconds \u2013 you have an almost 100 per cent chance of winning. Not easy to do in reality, but it\u2019s useful information. While most NRL teams focus heavily on pre-contact metres \u2013 the distance gained before first defensive contact \u2013 to build momentum, a different focus is required to beat Canberra. AI found the Raiders were uniquely driven by post-contact metres, those tough yards gained after contact. Limit those metres, and you can stop the Green Machine. AI has already identified at least one way to try to stop the Melbourne Storm. Credit: Getty Images Canterbury\u2019s embracing of AI reflects a broader transformation sweeping through professional sport worldwide. American sports leagues are leading the charge, with the NFL processing more than 500 million data points per season through its Digital Athlete system, reducing player injuries by 700 missed games since 2023. Major League Baseball has implemented AI for pitching analysis and injury prevention, while the NBA uses machine learning for player load management and game strategy optimisation. English Premier League clubs are using AI for recruitment: Brighton\u2019s system identified Moises Caicedo before his eventual \u00a3115 million ($240 million) transfer from them to Chelsea, while Liverpool\u2019s partnership with Google DeepMind has produced tactical analysis tools that club experts prefer over traditional methods 90 per cent of the time.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Canterbury\u2019s AI implementation is understandable given the competitive implications; NRL clubs are notoriously protective of innovations that might provide advantages. The technological investment aligns with the Bulldogs\u2019 recent restructure. The blue and whites are constructing a $50 million centre of excellence at Belmore and have significantly expanded their pathways programs, including taking over the Fiji Silktails program. Major League Baseball has implemented AI for pitching analysis. Credit: Getty Images \u201cWe\u2019re building for long-term success,\u201d Driussi says. \u201cThat means investing in the best people, the best facilities and the best technology available to us.\u201d Bulldogs chief executive Aaron Warburton confirmed the club\u2019s commitment to innovation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking at ways to improve our operations and give our players and staff the best possible tools to succeed,\u201d Warburton says. \u201cTechnology is certainly part of that equation.\u201d Loading The club\u2019s return to finals football last year, after missing the post-season for eight seasons, has been attributed to improved recruitment, player development and coaching. However, the role of AI in this transformation remains largely hidden. Given the global AI sports market is tipped to grow from $1.2 billion to nearly $30 billion by 2032, getting in early could be the key to success. Already, rivals are playing catch-up to Canterbury. For a club that has endured wooden spoons and years of mediocrity, the Bulldogs are marrying old-school values with cutting-edge technology. Whether that translates to premiership glory remains to be seen, but the Bulldogs are betting heavily that the future of rugby league will be shaped by artificial intelligence.",

    "text": "The popularity of caravanning and camping continues to climb, with Aussies embarking on 15.2 million trips last year.\n\nTravelling from Melbourne to Cairns, Melissa Perry's favourite places are the Victorian High Country, Mt Kosciusko, K'gari and the Whitsundays. Source: TikTok/@tr4velwithmel\n\nWhether it's international travellers or young Aussie families, more and more people are hitting the road for camping and caravan trips around the country. With the rising cost of living, it seems many Australians are opting for the more affordable domestic option of holidaying in campgrounds and national parks.\n\nOf course it's long been the remit of international backpackers to find a van and \"do a lap\" of the continent, and in the age of social media both young travellers and parents are sharing their hidden gems and tips on how best to see Australia's backyard on a budget.\n\nBritish backpacker Melissa Perry has been travelling up the east coast of Australia for the past three months, driving a van from Melbourne to Cairns.\n\n\"There are some great travel Apps out there such as WikiCamps and CamperMate that show areas you can free camp in. However, I will say that some are not always the best or cleanest campsites, which is why I like to share on my social media the best free ones that can be found,\" she told Yahoo News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHer favourite places so far are the Victorian High Country, Mt Kosciusko, K'gari (formerly Fraser Island) and the Whitsundays.\n\nIn 2024, Australians took 15.2 million caravan and camping trips, according to Tourism Research Australia. But the surge in popularity has coincided with increased reports of problems such as illegal dumping from caravan travellers and increased attention on the issue of ghost camping.\n\n\"Free camps can often require you to book a space online especially in Victoria and NSW. A few free camps I\u2019ve booked online I have noticed it says fully booked online, but when arriving there\u2019s been barely anyone there,\" Melissa said.\n\n\"It's frustrating to know that people are booking out 'free camps' and never turning up, stopping others from being able to book a slot.\"\n\nThe popularity of caravanning and camping in Australia continues to climb. Source: Getty\n\nWhile Victoria and NSW have both tried to tackle ghost camping, Melissa told Yahoo she's also experienced the opposite problem. \"I\u2019ve also booked a space, turned up and someone has already been in the space,\" she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVictoria recently ended a statewide free camping initiative, citing ghost camping as a reason not to continue the program.\n\nMeanwhile, in NSW, the national parks authority is currently in the process of overhauling camping fees, in part to address the issue of ghost camping. Public submissions on that process closed in May, but when asked by Yahoo on Friday, the National Parks and Wildlife Service would not say when it will publish a summary of that feedback or when the expected average increase to fees will likely begin.\n\nLife on the road more 'hectic' than people realise\n\nData from the Caravan Industry Association of Australia\u2019s 2025 Consumer Sentiment survey released this year found that Aussies are embracing the value of caravan and camping holidays, with 77 per cent saying they offer better value than other types of holidays.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore than three quarters (76 per cent) saw the option as great value for money, while exactly half of respondents believed domestic travel offered better value than heading overseas.\n\nFor Melissa, having a van is the ultimate freedom and actually the best way to see all the sights.\n\n\"You see so many people traveling who hit all the tourist spots, but the real good bits are in between towns in smaller or remote areas,\" she said.\n\nHowever, it's more work than most people realise, she warned, describing the day-to-day lifestyle as \"hectic\".\n\n\"I think people presume it\u2019s a really relaxed and chilled way of life, but in reality it\u2019s super busy all the time. Whether it be driving to the next location, planning a route, filling up fuel, doing a food shop, or even just finding somewhere to shower, the days just fly by.\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?
