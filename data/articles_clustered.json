(Getty: Kelly Defina/AFL Photos)\n\nLast year, Sydney and Collingwood kicked off the season at North Sydney Oval, rewarding the Swans for having the highest average attendances the following year at home games.\n\nMcCarthy said she would also like to see people encourage the AFL to consider a larger and more easily accessible venue for fans, such as Docklands.\n\nPrinces Park has a capacity of about 12,500. Last year's grand final there sold out within hours for the second year in a row.\n\nIn 2022 Essendon and Hawthorn's inaugural clash was moved to Docklands from North Port Oval after a strong public push. Tickets for the original venue sold out within 24 hours, in what the AFL called \"unprecedented ticketing demands\" in the women's game, following a campaign by Hawks then-coach Bec Goddard and CEO Justin Reeves.\n\nEssendon and Hawthorn's inaugural AFLW clash was moved to Docklands after public demand. (Getty: Michael Willson/AFL Photos)\n\nMcCarthy said she would like to see a similar push for the opener.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"It would be great if the entire AFLW community made a strong statement and got behind making this season opener one of the biggest ever to force the hand of the AFL to potentially move this to a larger stadium,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"I encourage fans that as soon as tickets go on sale, we purchase them, sell the venue out and see what people power can achieve. This would show truly how far the AFLW has come in 10 years.\"\n\nWhile the remainder of the fixture is yet to be released, the league has confirmed there will be no condensed fixture, after significant negative feedback last season when a majority of teams played four games within a 16-day window.\n\nThe season will expand to 12 games as part of an agreement struck in last year's collective bargaining agreement causing the opener to be pushed ahead of the AFL men's pre-finals bye weekend.",

(Supplied: US Critical Minerals)\n\nUS on fast track\n\nIn response, US President Donald Trump has issued a raft of executive orders to cut red tape, speed up mining approvals, and wants to fund projects by creating a new sovereign wealth fund.\n\nUS Critical Minerals is one of those companies listed for fast-tracking, according to Mr Kaye.\n\n\"We have ability through small mining exemptions, categoric exemptions, and the Defence Production Act to fast-track something that would have taken a few years [to get approval] down to 12-14 months,\" Mr Kaye said.\n\nHe thinks US government money could flow into processing projects in Australia.\n\n\"We're in direct conversation as we speak with the [Export-Import] bank \u2026 to encourage trade both ways,\" he said.\n\n\" We have identified Australia as our prime candidate to foster business relationships with. \"\n\nGlencore's Murrin Murrin mine in WA accounts for about 5 per cent of global cobalt production. (Supplied: Glencore)\n\nAustralian miners vulnerable\n\nMining generates more than $450 billion in export revenue for Australia, with most of that from iron ore and coal, according to the Minerals Council of Australia.\n\nCritical mineral exports are estimated to be worth just $7.6 billion this financial year according to the March Resources and Energy Quarterly Report from the Department of Industry Science and Resources but that could still increase significantly according to Professor Vlado Vivoda, the director of the Strategic Minerals Advisory and Research consultancy and a professor at the University of Queensland.\n\n\"Our reserves of lithium, nickel, cobalt are number two in the world, the same for copper, we're fourth for rare earths,\" he said.\n\nVlado Vivoda thinks Australia can ramp up production of critical minerals and rare earths. (Supplied: University of Queensland)\n\nAustralia is also the number one processor of lithium globally, although the price has fallen to its lowest level in four years.\n\nProfessor Vivoda said China has used its market dominance as a processor of critical minerals and rare earths to kill off competition from other countries, which is exactly what it did recently to Australia's nickel and lithium industries.\n\n\"They flooded the market with cheap Indonesian nickel, that's produced under not best practice \u2026 and a lot of our producers in Western Australia had to put mines into care and maintenance,\" he said.\n\nHe said the sector needs protection.\n\n\"This is not a free market globally so there is some necessity for strategic intervention to safeguard some of these mines that are deemed strategic or critical,\" Professor Vivoda said.\n\nAustralia has some of the richest critical mineral deposits in the world. (Supplied: Geoscience Australia)\n\nHe said the relationship with China has a chequered past.\n\n\"China has been the backbone of the Australian economy for a lot of lot of years, but \u2026 there have been certain frictions in that relationship,\" he said.\n\nChina banned key Australian commodities during the previous Liberal government including coal, barley, seafood, wine and beef.\n\nAll of those bans have since been lifted with China recently granting 10 new red meat companies access to the Chinese market and approving new protocols to allow Australian apples to go to China in increasing volumes.\n\nGovernment policies\n\nCritical minerals are a priority for the re-elected Labor party, which has provided tax breaks for miners and promised to set up a federal reserve of critical minerals.\n\nWhat purpose do critical minerals serve? Photo shows A person holds a handfull of ground nickel Australia is joining the European Union and the United States in establishing strategic reserves of critical minerals, but what do they actually do, and why are they so important?\n\nIt would offer voluntary agreements to miners to buy some of their output, and create a national stockpile of the minerals, effectively underwriting mines by guaranteeing some demand.\n\nProfessor Vivoda thinks that's a good idea.\n\n\"That would be a way to protect our producers,\" he said.\n\nThe Minerals Council of Australia is less sure.\n\nThe council's northern Australia executive director Cathryn Tilmouth said the policy could impact the commercial viability of Australian operations.\n\nShe said miners would need support to deliver those minerals to a reserve.\n\n\"To ensure they were able to afford energy, that they had appropriate IR (industrial relations), legislation, that they were able to get through the approvals processes, that they weren't facing the removal of fuel tax credits,\" she said.\n\nLynas Corporation runs the Mt Weld mine near Laverton in WA. (Supplied: Lynas Corporation)\n\nWalking the tightrope\n\nRST Solutions is one of those Australian companies walking the tightrope between China and the US.\n\nThey are working on mining projects all over the world, including China, and are expanding into the US through a partnership there.\n\nThey have provided environmental services to the big Stargate nickel processing plant set up by the Chinese in Indonesia to produce ferronickel and new energy nickel battery materials.\n\nOperations manager David Handel said they were helping to clean up the mine site.\n\n\"Sediment is getting washed off the mines into the waterways, so we're trying to stop it at the source,\" he said.\n\nRST Solutions is working with Chinese and Indonesian companies on environmental management at the Stargate Nickel mine in Indonesia. (Supplied: RST Solutions)\n\nHe said Australian companies have a lot to offer in terms of expertise in mining sustainably, but he doesn't think it will be easy for other countries to combat China's dominance of the sector.\n\n\"You'll never get the economic advantage that everyone's had out of China for years and years,\" Mr Handel said.\n\nAnd he's not concerned about the trade war and US tariffs because the Australian dollar is low, making his company's products and services relatively cheap in that country.\n\n\"Our Aussie dollar is so low, we're so attractive still, so these guys aren't even blinking when we're talking tariffs, it's not even coming up in conversation,\" Mr Handel said.",

    "text": "Millions of cars are bought and sold in Australia each year. At the moment, most of them are second-hand, petrol-fuelled vehicles.\n\nBut that pattern is changing. Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid cars are growing in popularity, driven in part by government and organisation pledges to electrify their fleets.\n\nVehicle efficiency standards, which are set to come into effect in July, should also see more EVs on the roads.\n\nSo as EVs start to filter through to the used-car market in greater numbers, what should prospective buyers consider before they make a purchase?\n\nBattery quality important, but usually underestimated\n\nGail Broadbent, an electric vehicle researcher at the University of New South Wales, says battery quality is the biggest concern used-EV buyers have.\n\nBut she also says used EVs typically have much better battery capacity than consumers expect.\n\n\"There's a big discrepancy with what people think and what the actuality is,\" Dr Broadbent says.\n\nManufacturing warranties typically guarantee that an EV battery will retain at least 70 per cent of its original charge over eight to 10 years.\n\nMost cars outperform this warranty.\n\nThis is partially due to the way that battery performance is tested. Lab-based tests completely discharge and recharge batteries on a frequent cycle to see how they retain their charge.\n\n\"Whereas in real life ... car manufacturers recommend that people keep the battery somewhere between 20 per cent and 80 per cent,\" Dr Broadbent says. This keeps the battery in much better shape.\n\nA new charging technology could help EV-owners save on power bills in 2025 \u2014 but there's a catch Photo shows A close-up of an orange electricity cable plugged into a car. Vehicle-to-grid charging promises to save households money and get more value out of EV batteries. Here's how to take advantage of \"V2G\".\n\nOther aspects of real-world use, such as the tiny charges collected from regenerative braking, also appear to extend EV battery lifetime.\n\nGiven enough time, batteries will inevitably degrade.\n\nThis doesn't happen uniformly \u2014 battery performance can often drop quickly in a new car.\n\nThis sometimes gives new owners the impression their battery will lose capacity much faster, but the batteries tend to stabilise after a few years and lose capacity at a slower rate.\n\nNew batteries and fast chargers, such as BYD's five-minute charger, should also see a wider variety of EV technology in Australia. (Unsplash: Michael Marais)\n\nKai Li Lim, an EV researcher at the University of Queensland, says a range of factors can accelerate battery degradation, leading to some older EVs with notably reduced ranges.\n\nAnything that heats the battery can wear them down faster, including warmer climates, excessive fast charging, and frequently powering the battery up to full.\n\n\"But the reality about battery degradation is that with the average age of EVs in the market, it's not really something that we can clearly observe,\" Dr Lim says.\n\nMore years of EV use \u2014 and more research \u2014 will generate clearer answers.\n\nChecking an EV battery\n\nIf you're considering buying a used EV, Dr Broadbent says it's still important to check the battery health, because \"not everybody is kind to their car\".\n\nElectric vehicles usually show estimates for the distance you can expect from a full battery charge.\n\nBut this readout isn't necessarily accurate. Like manufacturers' warranties, it often underestimates and sometimes overestimates the battery capacity.\n\n\"That range that's written on the car is an average of the last five trips, and if [the driver] used the air conditioner or the heater, it's going to reduce the range,\" Dr Broadbent points out.\n\nBYD takes on Tesla with ultra-fast EV chargers Photo shows People stand around a car with all its doors open with a sign in beg letters on the wall behind reading BYD. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has unveiled its ultra-fast charger that promises to take just five minutes to fully power EVs \u2014 putting heat on rival Tesla in the process.\n\nInstead, she says more accurate readouts of battery health can be obtained from an onboard diagnostics scanner.\n\nAt the moment, there is no standardised way to check EV battery health in Australia. Businesses such as insurers and used car dealers offer checks to people planning to buy or sell used EVs. The cost of these checks can vary widely.\n\nThe European Union introduced legislation last year that included an effort to standardise EV battery checks.\n\nRusty Langdon, a sustainability researcher at University of Technology Sydney (UTS), would like to see similar legislation in Australia.\n\n\"We're sort of at the whim of the market without Australian regulation that echoes that,\" they say.\n\nScott Dwyer, also a sustainability researcher at UTS, adds that there needs to be a suitable workforce to accommodate this.\n\n\"Training to traditional vehicle mechanics and funding for those small businesses to help them invest in their special diagnostic tools.\"\n\nBroadening used-EV uptake\n\nWhile standardisation could help with sales and consumer confidence, other policies will be needed to improve the supply of EVs in Australia.\n\nDr Dwyer says electrifying commercial fleets is a crucial way to increase EV uptake.\n\n\"About half of new car sales in Australia are sold into fleets,\" he says, adding that roughly a fifth of those sales are currently EVs.\n\n\" They are an important source of well-maintained and affordable EVs. \"\n\nDr Dwyer's research has also found people are more comfortable with the idea of buying or owning a personal EV after using one for work.\n\nAt the moment, the largest proportion of EV buyers are people living in outer suburbs of large cities. These people typically drive a lot and have easy access to cheap home charging, making EVs a sensible cost saver. Uptake is also high in inner metro areas.\n\nDr Lim wants to see more incentives for fleet EVs to increase uptake to other parts of Australia.\n\n\"You need a nice and robust second-hand car market of used EVs in order to make EVs more accessible to the general population,\" he says.\n\n\"The best way to make them cheaper is to put them through the second-hand car market, and the best way to put them through the second-hand car market is to have fleet uptakes.\"\n\nHe also wants to see better standards for checking battery quality for use after they're no longer suitable for an EV.\n\nLithium-ion waste soaring Photo shows A pile of burnt blue batteries on asphalt Australia's annual lithium-ion battery waste is tipped to hit 137,000 tonnes by 2035 amid urgent calls for dedicated recycling facilities.\n\nEV batteries can be used for other purposes, such as home batteries, when they're no longer powerful enough to take cars long distances.\n\n\"In due time, especially when lithium-ion batteries start to deplete, there will be a demand for this [EV battery repurposing],\" Dr Lim says.\n\nMx Langdon agrees.\n\n\"We don't have a really good understanding of battery lifetimes at the moment,\" they say.\n\n\"It would be good to have a better understanding of typical lifetime so that we can understand what the pathways are for second-hand vehicles and what consumers can expect.\"",

    "text": "Pat Cummins has delivered one of the finest bowling displays of this season's Indian Premier League (IPL) for Sunrisers Hyderabad, before watching rain end his team's campaign just as their survival hopes began to flicker.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad needed a thumping win over Delhi Capitals to keep alive their slim chance of making the play-offs, with captain Cummins doing his part to help the cause.\n\nHe took 3-19 off four overs in Hyderabad, ripping out Delhi Capitals' top order in a devastating opening spell, which helped restricted the visitors to 7-133 from their 20 overs.\n\nBut it was all in vain as the Sunrisers never took strike.\n\nVaibhav Suryavanshi age controversy explained Photo shows Vaibhav Suryavanshi wears a helmet on his head Vaibhav Suryavanshi announces himself as a global megastar with an astounding century in the IPL at just 14. Here is why his astonishing achievement has been met with raised eyebrows by some.\n\nSpectators and viewers were robbed of the chance to see Travis Head taking on Mitch Starc. It means the Sunrisers \u2014 last year's IPL finalists \u2014 are now mathematically out of the competition with three matches still to play.\n\nThe Capitals, having escaped with an unlikely point, are still in the mix but need to reverse their stuttering form with two wins from their last seven matches.\n\nHaving won the toss and chosen to bowl, Cummins took a wicket off the opening ball of each of his first three overs, all caught by wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan.\n\nHe dismissed Karun Nair, who feathered the first ball of the innings. In his second over, Nair's fellow opener Faf du Plessis was snared for 3, swinging and edging.\n\nIn Cummins' third over, Abishek Porel went for 8, athletically caught by Kishan running to backward square leg as the batter looped up a legside shot.\n\nThat left the Capitals 3-15 but Cummins was not finished, running back at mid-off to superbly catch opposition captain Axar Patel (6) off Harshal Patel.\n\nWhen KL Rahul (10) also departed cheaply, the Capitals were 5-29, but Tristan Stubbs (41 no off 36) and Ashutosh Sharma (41 off 26) guided them to a modest but at least respectable total.\n\nThe Sunrisers will have fancied their chances of knocking off the chase in good time to improve their net-run-rate, but rain in Hyderabad meant they never had the chance.\n\nAAP",

    "text": "There\u2019s also, of course, the 145 per cent tariff on imports from China. Even if the US and China do talk and agree a deal, the levies on China are likely to be multiples of what they were before \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d Loading Those \u201cother\u201d tariffs will, even without the reciprocals, feed into higher US prices and inflation and cause severe disruption to US supply chains, leading to shortages of stock and further shocks for businesses and consumers. The US economy contracted in the March quarter, although that was largely the result of consumers and companies rushing to make purchases before the tariffs hit. The likelihood, with corporate and consumer confidence battered by the tariffs, is that it will remain weak through the rest of the year, with a Trump-induced recession a definite possibility. That would normally cause the Fed to act by cutting rates decisively.\n\nThe tariffs (once the Trump administration decides their final form) ought to produce a one-time inflationary shock that the Fed could look through if the underlying economy were slowing significantly. However, having been bitten once, badly, by the massive and enduring spike in inflation that was caused by the supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, the Fed won\u2019t be quick to dismiss this new disruption to supply chains as \u201ctransitory.\u201d Instead, it will be patient and wait for the actual effects of the tariffs on the inflation rate to show up before it moves. [Fed chair Jerome Powell doesn\u2019t want to cut rates] \u2018because he\u2019s not a fan of mine. You know he just doesn\u2019t like me because I think he\u2019s a total stiff.\u2019 Donald Trump Powell has hinted that, if the central bank has to choose between containing inflation or protecting employment, the Fed will prioritise the inflation rate. The tariffs have created the prospect of stagflation, or an outcome where US inflation remains high even as the economic growth rate falls. While Trump will, as he did again last week and at the weekend, call for immediate rate cuts and lambast Powell for not delivering them, he\u2019s backed away from the threat he made last month to \u201cterminate\u201d Powell after a massive backlash in US markets.\n\n\u201cWhy would I do that? I get to replace the person (Powell) in another short period of time,\u201d he said in a television interview that aired on Sunday. Powell\u2019s term as chairman, but not as a Fed governor, ends in May next year. He said Powell doesn\u2019t want to cut rates \u201cbecause he\u2019s not a fan of mine. You know he just doesn\u2019t like me because I think he\u2019s a total stiff.\u201d Whether or not Powell dislikes Trump (he\u2019s got reason to, given the continual threats and abuse he\u2019s been subjected to), has no influence over the Fed\u2019s decision-making. With the US inflation rate still above the Fed\u2019s target and the jobs market still quite strong, there\u2019s no credible argument for cutting rates at this moment, and there\u2019s plenty of arguments for the Fed to be patient and wait for the tariff and budget-related events to unfold.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Fed that\u2019s uncertain about what the outlook for the economy might be. US companies are just as uncertain, with many suspending their profit forecasts, or offering materially different earnings scenarios that are dependent on the severity of the tariffs\u2019 impact on their businesses. Those effects will be largely negative, potentially materially so. Car giant Ford said on Monday that, even with some exemptions for auto companies, the tariffs would cost it $US1.5 billion this year. GM said last week they could carve up to $US5 billion from its earnings. The uncertainty is unlikely to be lifted soon, even if \u2013 as Trump and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have indicated \u2013 the administration announces the first of its trade deals this week. India, Japan and South Korea are reportedly the first cabs off the rank in agreeing to deals rather than face the punitive reciprocal tariffs. Loading Trade deals are complex, with the detail usually painstakingly negotiated over years, not weeks, so it is likely that, if deals are announced, they will be more headlines than fully-fledged agreements.\n\nStill, they would enable Trump to declare some victories, even if it takes years for the actual impact of the deals and the compliance of those signing them to become apparent. (China signed a deal in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first trade war, promising to massively boost purchases of US products but, with the pandemic intervening, bought less from America than it had before the deal). While the US sharemarket responded positively to the pause in the reciprocals and indications from China that it is willing to talk about a deal with the US (although that\u2019s been China\u2019s stance ever since Trump slapped his latest tariff on China\u2019s exports), the bottom line is that trade between the US and the rest of the world may never again be what it was. The universal tariffs and others remain in place, and the \u201cdeals\u201d Trump\u2019s team are negotiating will alter trade flows between the US and its trade partners. There might be some re-shoring of activity to America, although Trump seems overly optimistic on that front, but costs of living in the US will rise and corporate profits will fall because of the trade war. For the Fed, trying to weigh up the net outcomes on inflation, growth and employment at this point would be impossible, even if Trump weren\u2019t constantly changing, and complicating further, the dense web of tariffs he\u2019s created.",

    "text": "Markula says it\u2019s important to know that not all lenders rely on the insight provided by credit reporting bodies. \u201cLenders may have their own assessment tools and internal scores, which could combine the information they get from a credit report, along with other information.\u201d Loading She adds that a lender won\u2019t automatically provide you credit just because a credit reporting body provides an excellent credit score. \u201cSame goes if you have a poor credit score; this does not certainly mean you won\u2019t be able to get credit. However, in general, the higher the credit score, the better,\u201d she says. How are credit scores calculated? Credit scores are calculated by the credit reporting bodies themselves or the credit provider (e.g. a bank) you have applied to. This is done using a formula that evaluates a range of factors, including how well you pay your bills, how much debt you carry and how that stacks up against other borrowers.\n\nNot paying bills on time \u2013 or at all \u2013 is most likely to impact your credit score; for example, if you default on your account or if you skip monthly account payments. When it comes to making credit enquiries, there are a few misconceptions. \u201cIt\u2019s often thought that an enquiry will drop your score. That\u2019s not right. The impact of an enquiry can depend on a whole range of factors; it could increase or decrease your score. Or have very little effect at all,\u201d Markula says. Requesting financial assistance is viewed more favourably by lenders than missing payments. \u201cBut it is fair to say that many enquiries in a short period of time may drop the score.\u201d This could include applying for multiple credit cards in a few months. Having several unsecured short-term loans and buy-now-pay-later services may also have a poor impact.\n\nCredit reports also list your employment and residential history. Changing jobs or homes frequently could negatively impact your credit score, as these things might indicate financial stress. \u201cIt may be that having a poor credit score affects your ability to access credit. However, it is important to remember the score impact may depend on information available to a lender,\u201d she says. \u201cYou may have a poor Equifax score, but apply for credit with a lender that you already have a relationship with, and they will likely use the information they already have about you, to score you differently.\u201d How can you improve your credit score? Markula says ARCA tries to remind people to focus on the things they can change and control, as that\u2019s the information that goes into your credit report, rather than focusing on the actual score. The magic ingredient to a good credit score? Consistency. Making regular, on-time payments on credit and loan accounts is one of the most impactful factors. Getting on it is important, as improving credit scores can take time.\n\nLoading \u201cThe sooner you establish a reliable repayment history, the better. So, if you plan to apply for a mortgage in the next few years or take out a major loan, you should manage your credit health now by ensuring there is no negative information, such as a default listed against you for not making your debt obligations and by ensuring that you pay your bills on time.\u201d From natural disasters to job loss, there are a number of reasons someone might have trouble paying bills. In these cases, Markula says it\u2019s important to reach out to lenders early. Requesting financial assistance is viewed more favourably by lenders than missing payments. It does appear on your credit report but is deleted after 12 months. It does not impact your credit rating or score. How can people get their own credit score and report? One-third of Australians have never checked their credit report, according to YouGov research commissioned by ARCA in 2024.\n\nYou can check your credit score online and for free by heading to Equifax, Experian or Illion. You\u2019ll need to set up an account, provide identification and fill out an application. Most credit reports are delivered within 10 days. If you do order a credit report, it\u2019s best to read it through and ensure everything is correct. There might be inaccurate information that potentially impacts your credit score; if that\u2019s the case, you should approach the credit reporting body to rectify. You can get a free credit report every three months. It\u2019s good financial hygiene to order a credit report annually. One more tip to finish: if you have been rejected for a loan or credit, it\u2019s worth asking the lender why, to further educate yourself and help safeguard your credit rating in future. Advice given in this article is general in nature and not intended to influence readers\u2019 decisions about investing or financial products.

On a plaque near the entrance, he and his wife, dermatologist Orli Wargon, are listed among many others as founding donors of the ground-level Indigenous Yiribana Gallery. The Lowy Gonski Gallery sits in the original Walter Liberty Vernon-designed building. When the ribbon was finally cut on his beloved Sydney Modern, Gonski was in house quarantine with COVID. \u201cI still remember when I left Mike Baird\u2019s office, absolutely, going down in the lift and walking out, and realising how much had to be privately raised to build the new gallery,\u201d Gonski says. \u201cAnd here we are, in this beautiful building, delivered on time and on budget.\u201d David Gonski served as president of the AGNSW Trust for 19 years across two terms.

Archibald Prize season is under way, but he will sit on the sidelines. Gonski\u2019s successor, Michael Rose, now has the job of tallying the votes of gallery trustees on Friday and announcing the winning portraitist.\n\nGonski enjoyed the circus but understood its limitations: \u201cOne minute you\u2019re important, the next minute, having announced the winner, no one\u2019s interested in you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took me at least three Archibalds to realise that\u2019s what it was. No one even asked my opinion afterwards. They were gone.\u201d As chair for two separate terms, totalling 19 years, Gonski co-captained the prestigious institution under the directorship of the irrepressible Edmund Capon and, from 2014, the scholarly Michael Brand. Edmund Capon in front of Cy Twombly\u2019s Three Studies from the Temeraire. Credit: Jon Reid He was particularly taken by Capon\u2019s audacity and cheek. He remembers Capon rolling out the red carpet for the late comedian Barry Humphries one day, and having to field a call from an eagle eye in the premier\u2019s office who observed Capon had raised flags that by government decree should have been flying at half-mast. Gonski feigned ignorance. In 2004, Capon convinced Gonski and the gallery\u2019s trustees to spend about $4.5 million to acquire a triptych by American artist Cy Twombly that Gonski did not personally admire, and which had invited comparisons with the National Gallery of Australia\u2019s purchase of Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue poles.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Gonski asked Capon. He was persuaded and now loves the painting. \u201cI am not sure whether that is because I associate it so closely with Edmund or whether it is just so compelling.\u201d While the old Renaissance painters had their aristocratic patrons, Gonski is the modern face of arts boards governance, a model of consensus building, family legacy and investment that has come under sustained pressure as the geopolitical shockwaves from the war in Gaza have ricocheted across the world.

The aftershocks have yet to subside.\n\nMany of Sydney\u2019s biggest arts benefactors are Jewish, like Gonski, and some have exited the arts world amid claims of antisemitism and counter claims from pro-Palestinian voices of censorship. It\u2019s prompted profound reflection on the influence of philanthropy versus artistic expression. Gonski\u2019s advice to his fellow philanthropists has been to \u201cstay on the field while the ball is in play\u201d.

Gonski remains engaged with public life and has been appointed co-patron alongside Rhoda Roberts of the NAISDA Dance College, Australia\u2019s leading First Nation\u2019s arts training organisation. His name has been raised as a future chair of Opera Australia.\n\nThe much troubled national opera performing arts company is now without a chief executive or artistic director.

Paul Keating tapped him for his board \u201capprenticeship\u201d at Bundanon, chairing the trust overseeing the south coast property that Arthur and Yvonne Boyd gave the nation. It\u2019s Arthur Boyd that Gonski credits for expanding his way of seeing. Boyd would stand at his easel and challenge Gonski to see beyond the first blush of colour in the bushland. Where Gonski could pick up six types of greens, Boyd could see 10. They once inspected a venue at Callan Park as a possible art gallery dedicated to the work of Boyd, only for the project to fall over when the artist objected to the space\u2019s disrupted view of an old chimney. Gonski shrugs. Where business can be a shrewd numbers game, art turns on the tiniest slash of colour. It\u2019s an intellectual puzzle that fascinates but is not without sentiment.\n\nThe Gonskis have been art collectors for 35 to 40 years. \u201cPeople ask, \u2018do you change them?\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019 Each have special value, a 30th wedding anniversary and obviously anything by Arthur Boyd is very special.\u201d Loading Gonski was seven when his family moved to Sydney from Cape Town in 1961, in the aftermath of the Sharpeville massacre, in which 250 people were killed or injured in violent anti-apartheid demonstrations. His father, Alexander, was a neurosurgeon, a scholarship boy who relied on benefactors to send him to university to study science then medicine. \u201cMy life was a lot easier than it might have been otherwise, if it hadn\u2019t been for his hard work and the philanthropy of others,\u201d he notes. \u201cPhilanthropy often can improve the lives of a number of generations.\u201d From his mother, Helene, came his love for the arts. She would entice the young Gonski to visit the AGNSW with offers of ice-cream, the same trick he uses on his four grandchildren. \u201cArt has always lifted me.\u201d",

We've been able to pick up patients in the waiting room who are deteriorating, who we may have missed previously. Patient care is being decided a lot quicker than it used to be. So there are a lot of benefits for patient care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Dinh leads a team at the hospital seeking to improve emergency care through innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's currently exploring how A-I can help interpret brain scans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a CAT scan of a patient's brain...you can very quickly, based on the AI tool, spot the abnormality. It's an algorithm, it runs in the background and based off you know, million of other CT scans where these abnormalities present, it's a process of pattern recognition, it will pick out the abnormality for you almost instantaneously. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology is still a few years off, he says. and it's not designed to replace radiologists, but rather assist in emergencies when quick decisions must be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we need to have an interpretation of a CAT scan, for instance, within seconds of a patient coming in, that's where I see AI coming into play in the future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Farah Magrabi is a Professor of Biomedical and Health Informatics at the Australian Institute of Health Innovation at Macquarie University.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's currently engaged in research that seeks to investigate the clinical safety and effectiveness of AI technologies in the Australian healthcare setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AI is being increasingly developed and adopted across the healthcare system in Australia. There's lots of possibilities in terms of finding better ways to improve patient care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been significant advancements in A-I in recent years from interpreting x-rays and brain scans to disease detection.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK is set to trial a blood test that uses artificial intelligence to identify signs of a dozen cancers long before symptoms develop.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Professor Magrabi says for now, it's note-taking software that's seen the most rapid uptake in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These tools are specifically designed to sit in the background. They listen into a consultation and then they can prepare a summary of the consultation for the health professional to review and then accept into their notes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nScribes is software that uses a microphone - with patient consent - to capture speech during a consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assist doctors with clinical notes, treatment summaries and referrals - paperwork that can take hours each day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Productivity Commission estimates around 30 per cent of Australia's healthcare tasks could be automated saving around five billion dollars a year ... easing both time and cost pressures on the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the technology is not perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, a doctor mentions an issue with the patient's hand, feet, and mouth and the scribe summarise that it's hand, foot and mouth disease. We've heard of another example where a doctor mentioned scheduling a prostate examination and the scribe summarises that the examination has already been performed. So it's widely important that health, the professionals check the output of the AI for each summary note or each specialist letter that they use the scribe for . The system so to speak, is very aware of what is happening and they're rapidly putting in measures to ensure that AI is used safely and effectively.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslation programs are also touted as a way to bridge linguistic barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Lisa Woodland, the Director of New South Wales Multicultural Health says there is a lot of nuance when it comes communicating health information in an accurate and culturally sensitive way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For some language groups, for example the European languages, the level of accuracy is much higher but for many of the new and emerging and refugee languages, the accuracy is actually quite poor. When we used human translators that are based in Australia that understand the cultural nuances of the language and the communities that we translate for, we get a much better product.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "There\u2019s also, of course, the 145 per cent tariff on imports from China. Even if the US and China do talk and agree a deal, the levies on China are likely to be multiples of what they were before \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d Loading Those \u201cother\u201d tariffs will, even without the reciprocals, feed into higher US prices and inflation and cause severe disruption to US supply chains, leading to shortages of stock and further shocks for businesses and consumers. The US economy contracted in the March quarter, although that was largely the result of consumers and companies rushing to make purchases before the tariffs hit. The likelihood, with corporate and consumer confidence battered by the tariffs, is that it will remain weak through the rest of the year, with a Trump-induced recession a definite possibility. That would normally cause the Fed to act by cutting rates decisively.\n\nThe tariffs (once the Trump administration decides their final form) ought to produce a one-time inflationary shock that the Fed could look through if the underlying economy were slowing significantly. However, having been bitten once, badly, by the massive and enduring spike in inflation that was caused by the supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, the Fed won\u2019t be quick to dismiss this new disruption to supply chains as \u201ctransitory.\u201d Instead, it will be patient and wait for the actual effects of the tariffs on the inflation rate to show up before it moves. [Fed chair Jerome Powell doesn\u2019t want to cut rates] \u2018because he\u2019s not a fan of mine. You know he just doesn\u2019t like me because I think he\u2019s a total stiff.\u2019 Donald Trump Powell has hinted that, if the central bank has to choose between containing inflation or protecting employment, the Fed will prioritise the inflation rate. The tariffs have created the prospect of stagflation, or an outcome where US inflation remains high even as the economic growth rate falls. While Trump will, as he did again last week and at the weekend, call for immediate rate cuts and lambast Powell for not delivering them, he\u2019s backed away from the threat he made last month to \u201cterminate\u201d Powell after a massive backlash in US markets.\n\n\u201cWhy would I do that? I get to replace the person (Powell) in another short period of time,\u201d he said in a television interview that aired on Sunday. Powell\u2019s term as chairman, but not as a Fed governor, ends in May next year. He said Powell doesn\u2019t want to cut rates \u201cbecause he\u2019s not a fan of mine. You know he just doesn\u2019t like me because I think he\u2019s a total stiff.\u201d Whether or not Powell dislikes Trump (he\u2019s got reason to, given the continual threats and abuse he\u2019s been subjected to), has no influence over the Fed\u2019s decision-making. With the US inflation rate still above the Fed\u2019s target and the jobs market still quite strong, there\u2019s no credible argument for cutting rates at this moment, and there\u2019s plenty of arguments for the Fed to be patient and wait for the tariff and budget-related events to unfold.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Fed that\u2019s uncertain about what the outlook for the economy might be. US companies are just as uncertain, with many suspending their profit forecasts, or offering materially different earnings scenarios that are dependent on the severity of the tariffs\u2019 impact on their businesses. Those effects will be largely negative, potentially materially so. Car giant Ford said on Monday that, even with some exemptions for auto companies, the tariffs would cost it $US1.5 billion this year. GM said last week they could carve up to $US5 billion from its earnings. The uncertainty is unlikely to be lifted soon, even if \u2013 as Trump and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have indicated \u2013 the administration announces the first of its trade deals this week. India, Japan and South Korea are reportedly the first cabs off the rank in agreeing to deals rather than face the punitive reciprocal tariffs. Loading Trade deals are complex, with the detail usually painstakingly negotiated over years, not weeks, so it is likely that, if deals are announced, they will be more headlines than fully-fledged agreements.\n\nStill, they would enable Trump to declare some victories, even if it takes years for the actual impact of the deals and the compliance of those signing them to become apparent. (China signed a deal in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first trade war, promising to massively boost purchases of US products but, with the pandemic intervening, bought less from America than it had before the deal). While the US sharemarket responded positively to the pause in the reciprocals and indications from China that it is willing to talk about a deal with the US (although that\u2019s been China\u2019s stance ever since Trump slapped his latest tariff on China\u2019s exports), the bottom line is that trade between the US and the rest of the world may never again be what it was. The universal tariffs and others remain in place, and the \u201cdeals\u201d Trump\u2019s team are negotiating will alter trade flows between the US and its trade partners. There might be some re-shoring of activity to America, although Trump seems overly optimistic on that front, but costs of living in the US will rise and corporate profits will fall because of the trade war. For the Fed, trying to weigh up the net outcomes on inflation, growth and employment at this point would be impossible, even if Trump weren\u2019t constantly changing, and complicating further, the dense web of tariffs he\u2019s created.",

    "text": "Markula says it\u2019s important to know that not all lenders rely on the insight provided by credit reporting bodies. \u201cLenders may have their own assessment tools and internal scores, which could combine the information they get from a credit report, along with other information.\u201d Loading She adds that a lender won\u2019t automatically provide you credit just because a credit reporting body provides an excellent credit score. \u201cSame goes if you have a poor credit score; this does not certainly mean you won\u2019t be able to get credit. However, in general, the higher the credit score, the better,\u201d she says. How are credit scores calculated? Credit scores are calculated by the credit reporting bodies themselves or the credit provider (e.g. a bank) you have applied to. This is done using a formula that evaluates a range of factors, including how well you pay your bills, how much debt you carry and how that stacks up against other borrowers.\n\nNot paying bills on time \u2013 or at all \u2013 is most likely to impact your credit score; for example, if you default on your account or if you skip monthly account payments. When it comes to making credit enquiries, there are a few misconceptions. \u201cIt\u2019s often thought that an enquiry will drop your score. That\u2019s not right. The impact of an enquiry can depend on a whole range of factors; it could increase or decrease your score. Or have very little effect at all,\u201d Markula says. Requesting financial assistance is viewed more favourably by lenders than missing payments. \u201cBut it is fair to say that many enquiries in a short period of time may drop the score.\u201d This could include applying for multiple credit cards in a few months. Having several unsecured short-term loans and buy-now-pay-later services may also have a poor impact.\n\nCredit reports also list your employment and residential history. Changing jobs or homes frequently could negatively impact your credit score, as these things might indicate financial stress. \u201cIt may be that having a poor credit score affects your ability to access credit. However, it is important to remember the score impact may depend on information available to a lender,\u201d she says. \u201cYou may have a poor Equifax score, but apply for credit with a lender that you already have a relationship with, and they will likely use the information they already have about you, to score you differently.\u201d How can you improve your credit score? Markula says ARCA tries to remind people to focus on the things they can change and control, as that\u2019s the information that goes into your credit report, rather than focusing on the actual score. The magic ingredient to a good credit score? Consistency. Making regular, on-time payments on credit and loan accounts is one of the most impactful factors. Getting on it is important, as improving credit scores can take time.\n\nLoading \u201cThe sooner you establish a reliable repayment history, the better. So, if you plan to apply for a mortgage in the next few years or take out a major loan, you should manage your credit health now by ensuring there is no negative information, such as a default listed against you for not making your debt obligations and by ensuring that you pay your bills on time.\u201d From natural disasters to job loss, there are a number of reasons someone might have trouble paying bills. In these cases, Markula says it\u2019s important to reach out to lenders early. Requesting financial assistance is viewed more favourably by lenders than missing payments. It does appear on your credit report but is deleted after 12 months. It does not impact your credit rating or score. How can people get their own credit score and report? One-third of Australians have never checked their credit report, according to YouGov research commissioned by ARCA in 2024.\n\nYou can check your credit score online and for free by heading to Equifax, Experian or Illion. You\u2019ll need to set up an account, provide identification and fill out an application. Most credit reports are delivered within 10 days. If you do order a credit report, it\u2019s best to read it through and ensure everything is correct. There might be inaccurate information that potentially impacts your credit score; if that\u2019s the case, you should approach the credit reporting body to rectify. You can get a free credit report every three months. It\u2019s good financial hygiene to order a credit report annually. One more tip to finish: if you have been rejected for a loan or credit, it\u2019s worth asking the lender why, to further educate yourself and help safeguard your credit rating in future. Advice given in this article is general in nature and not intended to influence readers\u2019 decisions about investing or financial products.

    "text": "And, yet, his name is not emblazoned on the walls of the building. It bears an Indigenous name \u2013 Naala Badu \u2013 and no gallery is named for him. On a plaque near the entrance, he and his wife, dermatologist Orli Wargon, are listed among many others as founding donors of the ground-level Indigenous Yiribana Gallery. The Lowy Gonski Gallery sits in the original Walter Liberty Vernon-designed building. When the ribbon was finally cut on his beloved Sydney Modern, Gonski was in house quarantine with COVID. \u201cI still remember when I left Mike Baird\u2019s office, absolutely, going down in the lift and walking out, and realising how much had to be privately raised to build the new gallery,\u201d Gonski says. \u201cAnd here we are, in this beautiful building, delivered on time and on budget.\u201d David Gonski served as president of the AGNSW Trust for 19 years across two terms. Credit: Steven Siewert Gonski\u2019s second term as president of the Art Gallery of NSW board of trustees came to an end in December. The board is responsible for the gallery\u2019s strategic direction as well as overseeing the management of its collection and the foundation responsible for fundraising and investments. Archibald Prize season is under way, but he will sit on the sidelines. Gonski\u2019s successor, Michael Rose, now has the job of tallying the votes of gallery trustees on Friday and announcing the winning portraitist.\n\nGonski enjoyed the circus but understood its limitations: \u201cOne minute you\u2019re important, the next minute, having announced the winner, no one\u2019s interested in you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took me at least three Archibalds to realise that\u2019s what it was. No one even asked my opinion afterwards. They were gone.\u201d As chair for two separate terms, totalling 19 years, Gonski co-captained the prestigious institution under the directorship of the irrepressible Edmund Capon and, from 2014, the scholarly Michael Brand. Edmund Capon in front of Cy Twombly\u2019s Three Studies from the Temeraire. Credit: Jon Reid He was particularly taken by Capon\u2019s audacity and cheek. He remembers Capon rolling out the red carpet for the late comedian Barry Humphries one day, and having to field a call from an eagle eye in the premier\u2019s office who observed Capon had raised flags that by government decree should have been flying at half-mast. Gonski feigned ignorance. In 2004, Capon convinced Gonski and the gallery\u2019s trustees to spend about $4.5 million to acquire a triptych by American artist Cy Twombly that Gonski did not personally admire, and which had invited comparisons with the National Gallery of Australia\u2019s purchase of Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue poles.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Gonski asked Capon. He was persuaded and now loves the painting. \u201cI am not sure whether that is because I associate it so closely with Edmund or whether it is just so compelling.\u201d While the old Renaissance painters had their aristocratic patrons, Gonski is the modern face of arts boards governance, a model of consensus building, family legacy and investment that has come under sustained pressure as the geopolitical shockwaves from the war in Gaza have ricocheted across the world. Dumplings at MOD. Dining.

Six days later, Creative Australia\u2019s invitation is withdrawn, prompting protests, resignations and petitions. The aftershocks have yet to subside.\n\nMany of Sydney\u2019s biggest arts benefactors are Jewish, like Gonski, and some have exited the arts world amid claims of antisemitism and counter claims from pro-Palestinian voices of censorship. It\u2019s prompted profound reflection on the influence of philanthropy versus artistic expression. Gonski\u2019s advice to his fellow philanthropists has been to \u201cstay on the field while the ball is in play\u201d. It\u2019s his view that withdrawing from the field means those with \u201cantagonising views\u201d have won. MOD. Dining\u2019s crispy eggplant. Credit: Steven Siewert While philanthropists prioritise the nurturing of artistic talent, Gonski believes boards of publicly funded institutions have a wider obligation to serve the public interest. The institution is responsible for what is shown and must accept that responsibility. That\u2019s not censorship, he insists, but care, risk management and due diligence. Gonski remains engaged with public life and has been appointed co-patron alongside Rhoda Roberts of the NAISDA Dance College, Australia\u2019s leading First Nation\u2019s arts training organisation. His name has been raised as a future chair of Opera Australia.\n\nThe much troubled national opera performing arts company is now without a chief executive or artistic director. It\u2019s had two chairs in three years, and discontent is brewing around Rod Sims, its current chair. \u201cI love the concept of giving back, I genuinely do,\u201d Gonski says. \u201cI often suspect that I get more out of the giving than what I have given.\u201d Satay skewers at MOD. Dining. Credit: Steven Siewert Gonski keeps to sparkling mineral water, he has afternoon meetings to keep. Asked for lunch recommendations, Gonski is unfamiliar with the Asian fusion menu of MOD. chef Sushil Aryal, though he has dined here several times. \u201cI was here usually to duchess somebody who hopefully would give us some money.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI wasn\u2019t concentrating on what I was eating. I was looking to the results.\u201d\n\nGonski\u2019s bowl of chicken and chives dumplings, dressed in chilli oil and black vinegar, arrives first. Then a small plate of three chicken satay sticks. My batons of crispy eggplant come with a delicious chilli caramel. But, as in previous outings at MOD., eating is not the main game. No one can read the room like Gonski can, a friend of his later assures me. \u201cPoliticians are motivated by venal desires; he is not beholden by anything to anyone. Whatever he leads, he works in their best interests. He\u2019s like a great rabbi, he takes a sniff of the wind and works out what is going on.\u201d Lunch at MOD. Dining Crispy eggplant $26 Jasmine rice $6 Satay chicken skewers $24 Chicken dumpling $22 Total: $78 In the weeks since we sat down for lunch, the gallery\u2019s director is named as Maud Page, the institution\u2019s first female director. I subsequently ask Gonski what he thinks of the appointment. He is delighted. \u201cIt is the right choice at the right time. Maud will be very successful taking the gallery to new heights.\u201d Brand was \u201ca joy to work with, and he led us as a group with enormous focus, intelligence and decency\u201d.\n\nA former corporate lawyer and merchant banker, now company director, Gonski has sat on some 40 boards of business and not-for-profits, including Sydney Theatre Company, chair to theatre\u2019s dream team of Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton, and the National Institute of Dramatic Art. Paul Keating tapped him for his board \u201capprenticeship\u201d at Bundanon, chairing the trust overseeing the south coast property that Arthur and Yvonne Boyd gave the nation. It\u2019s Arthur Boyd that Gonski credits for expanding his way of seeing. Boyd would stand at his easel and challenge Gonski to see beyond the first blush of colour in the bushland. Where Gonski could pick up six types of greens, Boyd could see 10. They once inspected a venue at Callan Park as a possible art gallery dedicated to the work of Boyd, only for the project to fall over when the artist objected to the space\u2019s disrupted view of an old chimney. Gonski shrugs. Where business can be a shrewd numbers game, art turns on the tiniest slash of colour. It\u2019s an intellectual puzzle that fascinates but is not without sentiment.\n\nThe Gonskis have been art collectors for 35 to 40 years. \u201cPeople ask, \u2018do you change them?\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019 Each have special value, a 30th wedding anniversary and obviously anything by Arthur Boyd is very special.\u201d Loading Gonski was seven when his family moved to Sydney from Cape Town in 1961, in the aftermath of the Sharpeville massacre, in which 250 people were killed or injured in violent anti-apartheid demonstrations. His father, Alexander, was a neurosurgeon, a scholarship boy who relied on benefactors to send him to university to study science then medicine. \u201cMy life was a lot easier than it might have been otherwise, if it hadn\u2019t been for his hard work and the philanthropy of others,\u201d he notes. \u201cPhilanthropy often can improve the lives of a number of generations.\u201d From his mother, Helene, came his love for the arts. She would entice the young Gonski to visit the AGNSW with offers of ice-cream, the same trick he uses on his four grandchildren. \u201cArt has always lifted me.\u201d",

Source: Supplied\n\nAhead of this week\u2019s enticing $30 million Powerball jackpot draw, lottery officials have revealed to Yahoo News the biggest mistake winners are likely to make after instantly becoming a multi-millionaire.\n\nWith prizes so huge, Powerball winners understandably can\u2019t wait to start spending their money. But the Lott, which runs the life-changing game, has a provision in place forcing winners to stop and think about how they are going to spend their newfound fortune.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake a winner could make is rushing into their decisions,\u201d the Lott\u2019s Anna Hobdell said in an interview with Yahoo News.\n\nAnna makes the calls to the winners of massive prizes in Powerball, Lotto and Oz Lotto. After convincing them the call is not a hoax, she then explains they cannot spend their prize money straight away.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWith our Lotto prizes, thankfully you do have to wait two weeks until you receive the funds, so we do encourage our players to have a think over the next two weeks about what they want to do with their winnings, and to perhaps get some financial advice.\u201d\n\nWinners who purchase a ticket in-store have to either visit the Lott\u2019s head office or mail in the ticket to claim their prize. Online players get the funds automatically deposited into their account after a fortnight.\n\nWhat do big lotto winners spend their prize money on?\n\nThe Lott Winners Report for 2024 revealed what the 500 winners of division one prizes across all lottery games in 2023 did with their prize money.\n\nInvesting for the future (53 per cent) was the most popular explanation for how the money was spent, followed by helping family and friends (40 per cent). Just over a quarter of winners (27 per cent) paid off their mortgages, in part or in full, while 26 per cent bought a new house and over a third of lottery winners bought a new car.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHolidaying with family was a popular treat with winners including one who booked a cruise for 38 people, while 13 per cent of winners donated some of their prize money to charity.\n\nThe largest Australian lottery win was a year ago when an Adelaide man won the $150m Powerball jackpot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never screamed so loud or jumped so high,\u201d the winner told officials from the Lott.\n\nThis week\u2019s $30 million Powerball jackpot will be drawn on Thursday with tickets on sale until 7.30pm (AEST) on the night.\n\nIf gambling is a problem for you go to Gambling Help Online or call 1800 858 858.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
