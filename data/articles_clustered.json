    "text": "The Trump administration is bailing out Argentina in a move critics are saying has more to do with politics than economics or American interests.\n\nThat means $20 billion (AU$30.5 billion) US taxpayer dollars will be used to bail out a country led by a close ally of President Donald Trump: chainsaw-wielding, libertarian Javier Milei.\n\n\"Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote on X on Thursday. \"The US Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with Argentine President Javier Milei during the United Nations General Assembly. (AP)\n\nMeanwhile, the US federal government is nearing two weeks of being shut down and US businesses and industries continue to reel from Trump's ongoing trade war.\n\nHere are some key details about the administration's extraordinary financial rescue of Argentina.\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\nArgentina is at risk of a financial collapse.\n\nThe country's currency fell sharply after President Milei's party suffered a significant defeat in elections last month. The losses shook investors' confidence in Milei's ability to see through his economic reforms.\n\nMilei has slashed government spending, cut regulations and fired tens of thousands of public-sector workers since taking office in 2023. His administration has seen some success; inflation in Argentina eased this year to the slowest monthly pace in more than four years.\n\nREAD MORE: Israeli hostages on cusp of freedom as Trump heads to Middle East\n\nJavier Milei's government is struggling. (Tomas Cuesta/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that Argentina's financial strife could spill over into other economies if it isn't contained swiftly.\n\nAdministration officials say they also see a risk of Argentina, a major economy in South America, strengthening its ties with China.\n\nThe next legislative elections in Argentina take place on October 26.\n\nWhat is the US doing?\n\nOn Thursday, Bessent confirmed on social media that Argentina's bailout is moving forward in two keys ways.\n\nBessent said the administration has finalised a $20 billion currency swap agreement with Argentina's central bank, allowing it to exchange its local currency for the US dollar.\n\nIt's essentially a $20 billion loan, experts say.\n\nTrump's top economic official also said the administration \"directly\" purchased an undisclosed amount of Argentine pesos. It's only the fourth time since 1996 that the United States has bought another country's currency, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThese measures are aimed at stabilising Argentina's financial markets.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Qantas to face scrutiny after data leak exposes millions\n\nA customer pays for food with Argentine peso banknotes in the financial district of Buenos Aires, Argentina, on September 8. (Tomas Cuesta/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\n\nWhy is it controversial?\n\nThe United States has provided foreign countries with financial lifelines before, usually when the stability of the global economy is at risk or when a close geopolitical ally, such as Mexico, finds itself underwater and could damage to US creditors and investors.\n\nBut this bailout isn't urgent, it's happening at an awkward time, and critics are accusing Trump of using billions of American dollars just to prop up one of his own personal allies.\n\n\"The Treasury's decision to offer a 'swap' in Argentina is really a signal that Washington is willing to wield its financial tools for political purposes in ways that depart from past norms,\" wrote Heidi Crebo-Rediker, a former chief economist at the State Department, and Douglas Rediker, a former US representative on the International Monetary Fund's executive board, in a Financial Times column published on October 2.\n\nThis is all while the US government is shut down, which has resulted in more than a million federal workers being furloughed or working without pay.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent appears in the in the Oval Office of the White House on September 25, in Washington, DC. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images via CNN Newsource)\n\n\"It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own,\" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the result has been a one-two punch against American farmers from Trump's own policies. American farmers are having a tough year, in no small part because of Trump's bid to reshape global trade. And Argentina's bailout inadvertently worsened their plight.\n\nChina, a major buyer of US soybeans, halted purchases of the commodity in May in response to Trump's trade war. Then, after Argentina temporarily scrapped export taxes on grains, China swooped in and bought tens of thousands of pounds of Argentine soybeans instead.\n\n\"Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers' biggest market??? We shld use leverage at every turn to help hurting farm economy Family farmers shld be top of mind in negotiations by representatives of USA,\" Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa wrote on X on September 25.\n\nWho benefits?\n\nBeyond Millei, China, and the Argentine treasury, critics say the bailout also stands to greatly benefit wealthy fund managers who are major holders of Argentine debts and assets.\n\nThe bailout would deliver a major windfall to Rob Citrone, a billionaire hedge fund manager with significant investments in Argentina. \"Bessent's personal and professional relationship with Citrone has spanned decades,\" according to independent journalist Judd Legum.\n\nArgentina's President Javier Milei (R) speaks next to legislative candidate Manuel Adorni (C) and Argentina's Secretary General of the Presidency Karina Milei during an open-air political rally at Parque Sarmiento in Cordoba, Argentina on September 19. (Diego Lima/AFP/Getty Images via CNN Newsource)\n\n\"Trump promised 'America First,' but he's putting himself and his billionaire buddies first and sticking Americans with the bill,\" Warren said in a statement on Thursday. Eight Democrats, including Warren, have introduced a bill in Congress to prevent Argentina's bailout.\n\nBut Bessent told CNBC recently that \"this trope that we're helping out wealthy Americans with interest down there couldn't be more false.\"\n\n\"What we're doing is maintaining a US strategic interest in the Western Hemisphere,\" he added.",

    "text": "Steve Hui is known as the \"Points Whisperer\", one of the Australia's foremost authorities on maximising return from frequent flyer points, and he has a warning for Aussies.\n\nThere's a huge change coming \ufefffor the rewards landscape, and it's not looking good.\n\nHui predicts that \ufeffthe Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) proposed reforms banning surcharges on eftpos, Mastercard and Visa cards could slash the number of points everyday Aussies earn with each purchase.\n\nSteve Hui warned Aussies there are big changes coming to the way we earn frequent flyer points. (Instagram/@iflyflat)\n\nSo if you're a Qantas Frequent Flyer, Virgin Velocity Frequent Flyer, or other points collector who earns through card purchases, you might soon be a lot worse off.\n\n\"Your ability to earn points will drop in a number of areas,\" Hui, founder of points travel advisory iFLYflat, told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"A lot of credit cards will have to change their reward system because the revenue won't be there to pay for these rewards at the current level.\"\n\nFor example, credit cards that currently offer one frequent flyer point \ufeffper dollar spent may drop to one point per $2 spent, or more.\n\nIn short, \ufeffearning frequent flyer points will get more expensive.\n\nHui said the RBA's proposed \ufeffsurcharge and interchange reforms will significantly impact how Aussies earn points and how many they can earn in a single transaction.\n\n\"I believe it will change the whole rewards landscape in Australia, and probably be the biggest change in 15 years,\" he said.\n\n\"What we don't know is when the changes are going to be implemented.\"\n\nBut as it becomes harder to earn points and the number of points required to access rewards\ufeff keeps going up, is it even worth it for everyday Aussies to be part of frequent flyer loyalty programs anymore?\n\nA growing number of consumers don't seem to think so.\ufeff\n\nNew research from Finder revealed 57 per cent of Aussies \u2013 equivalent to more than 12 million people \u2013 no longer see the value in Qantas or Virgin's programs.\n\nOnly one in three think Qantas Frequent Flyer points are worth the chase, and just one in four believe Virgin Velocity points are worth it.\n\nThese attitudes should come as no surprise, given that Velocity recently slashed the number of points non-Velocity credit card holders earned per dollar while Qantas\ufeff hiked up the points needed to redeem fares.\n\nHui understands why some Aussies have been turned off frequent flyer programs but said they still have plenty of value for those who play it smart.\n\n\ufeff\"It really all comes down to people working out what's the cost versus benefit of the points,\" he said.\n\n\"If benefit exceeds cost, then it's always worthwhile.\"\ufeff\n\nThe cost is the fee paid to collect the points, like annual credit card fees or surcharges, while benefit can be rewards like flights and seat upgrades.\n\nREAD MORE: Paedophile allowed to have photo of his victims at his bedside as he died\n\n\"If benefit exceeds cost, then it's always worthwhile.\"\ufeff (Getty)\n\nBut making the most of your points isn't as simple as accruing a bunch and spending them on anything.\n\nThe biggest mistake Aussies make with frequent flyer programs is not knowing how many points they actually need to get the rewards they want.\n\n\ufeffHui said the best tactic is to decide where you want to go and what class of fare you want, find out how many points it costs, and work backwards.\n\nWork out which retailers offer the points you're collecting and prioritise them whenever you can, from the supermarket (Qantas Points with Everyday Rewards at Woolworths) to the petrol station (Velocity Points at 7-Eleven stores.\n\nHui also encourages everyday consumers to pick one program and stick with it to hit their points goals and earn rewards faster.\n\nSpreading points around usually only works for business travellers who fly constantly, who can learn how to optimise their points with a membership program Hui is set to launch next week.\n\nREAD MORE: Man arrested over fire that destroyed 6000 LA homes\n\nHui is the founder and chief executive of iFLYflat, which claims to be Australia's top points travel experts. (Instagram/@iflyflat)\n\nIf you're tossing up \ufeffwhich frequent flyer program to focus on, Hui's favourites in 2025 have been Virgin, Qatar and Cathay Pacific.\n\nQantas didn't make the cut, but don't jump ship if you're already collecting Qantas points.\n\nInstead, Hui said to focus on accruing as many points as possible in the program you're already with before the RBA's proposed surcharge reforms kick in and potentially slash your earning power.\n\n\"Make hay when the sun shines because the system's always changing and if you wait, then you may miss out.\"",

(Supplied: Queensland University of Technology)\n\n\"I still have questions about how much any minister of the day can change what is or isn't excluded from those central definitions,\" Dr Keogh said.\n\n\"I think there's concern in the video game industry about just how reliable or permanent that exclusion of [online] games is.\"\n\nBanning games 'whack-a-mole'\n\nLast month, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant confirmed she had written to online game platforms, including Roblox and Lego Play, advising the ban could apply to their services.\n\nAccording to Marcus Carter, professor in human computer interaction at the University of Sydney, Roblox is \"rightfully critiqued\" for a lack of effective moderation of \"fringe, far-right material\" uploaded by users.\n\nMarcus Carter says Roblox attracts 360 million players per month, who can upload content to the platform. (Supplied: Roblox Corporation)\n\nHe said although this was a risk factor for young people, any ban would simply push them on to other games.\n\n\"When I ran studies in 2021, everybody was playing Fortnite. Now, the kids are all playing Roblox and in three years, they'll be playing a different game,\" he said.\n\n\"Is the commissioner going to play whack-a-mole with every game that children start playing? Once children are banned from creating an account on one game, they're just going to move to another game.\"\n\nIncluding games in ban an 'overreaction'\n\nProfessor Carter said the risk factors did not justify the social media ban being expanded to include online video games.\n\n\"The risks are overwhelmingly outweighed by the positive social, creative and intellectual benefits of playing games for young people,\" he said.\n\n\"Parents should engage with their children and the [video] games they play, but banning children from those spaces would be a ridiculous overreaction.\"\n\nMarcus Carter says play, digital or otherwise, is a human right for all children. (Supplied: University of Sydney)\n\nAccording to a statement released by the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, video games are regulated by the National Classification Scheme, which provides clear guidelines on age-appropriateness and content.\n\nDevelopers building safer games\n\nAshley Ringrose, founder of Australian video game developer SMG Studios, said he was not worried about losing business over the ban.\n\n\"Only about 2 per cent of our market is in Australia, so even if we lose 50 per cent of our [Australian] users, it's 1 per cent of our market,\" he said.\n\nMr Ringrose, a father of two, said SMG Studios' games, some of which allowed young people to interact online, were designed with safety in mind.\n\nAshley Ringrose says SMG Studios restricted online players to 13 years plus when developing Risk: Global Domination. (Supplied: SMG Studios)\n\n\"Children could describe something innocuous, like where they live, their school or their favourite restaurants, that identifies them. We try to restrict that,\" he said.\n\n\" We purposely don't have live [text or voice] chat in our games because of the potential for exploitation of people giving basic personal information. \"\n\nMr Ringrose said SMG Studios had also used \"canned chat\", where players send pre-defined messages and restricted online play to players' digital friends or teenaged players only.\n\n'Not the right way to go'\n\nProfessor Carter would like to see more safeguards in online video games, but he said a ban was not the answer.\n\n\"A ban is going to eradicate the opportunity to create 'safety by design' features that make children's online play worlds better,\" he said.\n\n\"That's not the right way to go about building a safer children's internet.\"",

    "text": "The government has bowed to pressure on its superannuation tax policy, one of the few revenue-raising measures it had promised, two years on from when it was first announced.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers confirmed he had worked with the prime minister to overhaul the proposal to increase taxes on the largest superannuation balances, which was signed off by cabinet this morning.\n\nThe government has made two key concessions that were criticisms of the bill: first, the threshold at which higher tax rates will kick in will now be indexed to inflation, and the proposal will no longer apply to unrealised capital gains.\n\nAlongside the $3-million threshold at which the tax rate on earnings had been doubled, a new threshold of $10m will also be created at which a 40 per cent tax rate will be applied.\n\nBut those thresholds will now be indexed, meaning it will no longer capture more people over time due to bracket creep.\n\nThe government expects the $3m threshold to apply to roughly 90,000 balances and the $10m threshold to apply to about 8,000 balances.\n\nThe treasurer said the government was prepared to rework the bill to see it through parliament.\n\n\"We have always had in our back pocket indexation, or an indexation like this, in order to get it through parliament,\" Mr Chalmers said.\n\nA tax offset for low-income earners would also be increased from $310 to $810, and would be offered to workers earning up to $45,000, which Mr Chalmers said would give those people about an extra $15,000 at retirement on average.\n\nMr Chalmers said the new plan would raise slightly less than the government's original proposal in the short-term.\n\nBut now that the tax increases will be indexed significantly less is expected to be raised in the longer-term.\n\nThe government has always argued that those thresholds could have been adjusted over time to account for inflation.\n\nGreens leader briefed\n\nThe treasurer confirmed he also met with Greens leader Larissa Waters shortly after the rework was agreed to by cabinet, with the minor party shaping as the most likely option for the bill to be passed.\n\nThe proposed tax increase on some of the nation's wealthiest income earners was announced more than two years ago, and was meant to be in effect from July.\n\nBut it was met with criticism, including from within Labor, and the bill was never introduced to parliament.\n\nLate last week it emerged that the prime minister's office, alongside the treasurer's, had sought advice from the Treasury Department on how to address some of the \"concerns\" with the bill.\n\nThe treasurer played down questions about the government's appetite for reform, given the difficulty it has had with one of the few revenue-raising measures committed to by the government.\n\n\"This is difficult tax reform \u2026 I don't accept the characterisation this is simple, or easy or uncontested,\" Mr Chalmers said.\n\n\"This is a difficult change which will mean we raise billions of dollars.\"\n\nIt will begin from July next year.",

(Supplied: Christopher Lund)\n\nRed beams of light represent bloodroot\n\nKola said the inspiration for his first Australian display was equal parts culture and location.\n\n\"The idea of the project started actually from the Menang people and the Menang plant \u2026 the bloodroot,\" he said.\n\nTasting the plant inspired the installation.\n\n\"It was incredibly spicy, a powerful medicinal herb with a flavour that left a lasting impression,\" he said.\n\n\"Taste became the beginning of the story.\n\n\" The red beams of light will represent the roots, connecting the land to the cosmos. \"\n\nKari Kola has illuminated famous sites including Stonehenge and the Eiffel Tower. (Supplied: Christopher Lund)\n\nThe 47-year-old's passion for creating massive lightscapes was born in 2006, after an accident in which he broke his back while working as a lighting tech in a concert hall.\n\nHe was paralysed from the waist down, but as he learnt to walk again, Kola said he was gifted a new perspective on life.\n\n\"I remember those slow walks and the light and how it touched things \u2026 it changed my perspective,\" he said.\n\nKola said the accident was the best thing that could have happened to him.\n\n\"I want to be uncomfortable so that I can push myself to learn more \u2026 to achieve an installation of this immense scale, you have to have cooperation, teamwork and be open to knowledge,\" he said.\n\nDisplay to illuminate culture\n\nThe display was developed in consultation with the Albany community and local elders to make it more than a light show.\n\n\"This red light has a significance \u2014 it's related to a special plant that used to, and still does, grow here,\" said Menang elder Lester Coyne.\n\nLester Coyne hopes people gain a new appreciation for the local culture. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Collins)\n\n\" It was used as a food source for our people and to have it featured in that way is quite spectacular. \"\n\nMr Coyne said he hoped people would gain a new appreciation for local culture through the display.\n\n\"I'd like to think this isn't just about looking at coloured lights \u2014 it's about remembering why they're there, what they represent and the story behind them.\n\n\" It reminds people that we shared this country and some paid a very heavy price for that. \"\n\nKing George Sound will be illuminated with 750 LED lights and a dozen red pencil beams. (Supplied: Christopher Lund)\n\nMore than 750 high-powered LED floodlights and a dozen red lasers, dotted along the sound, will project a special hue designed to have a minimal impact on the environment.\n\nWhile the artwork is temporary, Kola said he hoped its fleeting nature would live on in people's memories.\n\n\"I hope that the project will leave residents and visitors to Albany with a positive and permanent memory that will be forever etched in their mind, without leaving anything visible behind,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope that 50 years after the project, there will still be people talking about 'something special that happened' in Albany.\"",

    "text": "Judy Dent remembers the day her terminally ill husband Bob told her he had enough.\n\nBob Dent had been suffering from incurable prostate cancer for nearly five years, and by that stage Judy said Bob was only half living.\n\n\"It got to the stage where managing the pain meant that he couldn't see, he couldn't hear, he couldn't do anything,\" she said.\n\nJudy Dent's husband was the first person to die from a legal, voluntary lethal injection, and she has remained a VAD advocate since his death. (ABC News: Peter Garnish)\n\nIn September 1996, Bob Dent became the first person in the world to die through legally accessible voluntary assisted dying (VAD).\n\nHe was able to access the health service after the Northern Territory \u2014 under then-chief minister Marshall Perron \u2014 passed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act in 1995.\n\nIn 1995, then-chief minister Marshall Perron's successful private members bill made the Northern Territory the first jurisdiction in the world to allow access to voluntary assisted dying.\n\nIt was a piece of legislation that made the territory the first place in the world to allow terminally ill patients to have control over when and how they died.\n\nSo, after a Sunday lunch with doctor Philip Nitschke, in a bed set up on the verandah of Bob and Judy's Darwin home, Dr Nitschke asked Bob a series of three questions.\n\n\"Bob said 'yes \u2026 yes \u2026 yes' and then the fluid started going into his arm,\" Judy said.\n\n\"Almost instantly the pain signs disappeared from his face and he just looked peaceful.\"\n\nJudy held Bob's hand all the while.\n\nJudy Dent believes there is community support for the introduction of VAD in the NT. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nA year after Bob died, the federal government intervened and overturned the Perron government's law, stripping the Northern Territory of its power to allow voluntary assisted dying.\n\nThat remained the case for 25 years, until the federal government repealed the ban in 2022, giving the NT and ACT the ability to pass VAD legislation.\n\nWith all other Australian states and territories having now legalised VAD, the NT remains the only jurisdiction in the country that has not.\n\nIn May, the NT government tasked a parliamentary committee with consulting communities across the territory on the issue and, if recommended, providing drafting instructions for a new law.\n\nThe committee has now tabled its report, recommending \"VAD legislation be adopted in the NT\".\n\nThe drafting instructions, aimed at shaping an NT-specific framework, included not requiring there to be a timeframe on a person's prognosis \u2014 or no fixed \"months to live\" requirement.\n\nThe NT has the nation's highest proportion of Indigenous Australians, and many people live in remote areas.\n\nThe committee's view was VAD should be provided across the territory with a decentralised \u2014 or community-based \u2014 delivery model.\n\nIt recommended potential NT VAD legislation expand the parameters of institutional conscientious objection \u2014 the ability to refuse to provide an aspect of VAD due to moral or ethical conflicts \u2014 to promote cultural safety.\n\nA report tabled to the NT government recommended adopting voluntary assisted dying laws. (Supplied: Unsplash/Manny Becerra)\n\nThe committee also recommended the government develop a territory-wide palliative care strategy, after hearing evidence and testimonies during the VAD consultation process.\n\nJudy said she welcomed the prospect of VAD becoming once again accessible in the NT.\n\n\"We have been waiting for this a long time,\" she said.\n\nCultural and religious concerns remain\n\nDespite the parliamentary report and community support, there is still some opposition.\n\nLoading...\n\nAlice Springs-based Pentecostal Christian pastor Sherry Lowah, an Arrernte, Luritja, Pitjantjatjara and Torres Strait Islander woman, said VAD legislation was a community decision, not just an individual's decision.\n\n\"Indigenous people see life as sacred. We have to fight to the end and you don't give up on people,\" Pastor Lowah said.\n\nKenneth Devereux, a retired minister for the Uniting Church of Australia in Alice Springs, weighs the issue differently.\n\n\"I'm aware of orthodox tradition that says life is sacred, but I also see the Christian tradition of offering compassion for people who are suffering as being an equally important part of respecting the sanctity of life,\" he said.\n\nThe Catholic Church has long been against VAD in all its forms, but Father Prakash Menezes, the parish priest of Santa Teresa, believes the argument is not \"just a religious thing\".\n\n\"It is a natural law to protect life. The debate has changed from where it once was,\" he said.\n\nFather Menezes said he was concerned VAD laws would gradually expand beyond the proposed legislation.\n\nHe believes that instead of VAD, Australia should improve its palliative care.\n\n\"Australia has got the means to do this\", he said.\n\nPhilip Nitschke wants the Northern Territory to pass laws allowing voluntary assisted dying. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\nNearly 30 years since Dr Nitschke treated Bob Dent on that Darwin verandah, he maintains his view that VAD is a human right.\n\n\"It is not for us to decide if people want to die, that is their choice,\" he said.\n\nAfter years of campaigning for VAD to be legalised, Judy said it was anybody's guess when the NT government would act on the parliamentary report's recommendations.\n\nShe believes there is wide support for VAD legislation in the territory.\n\n\"I don't think we should be deprived of the legislation because one or two members of parliament don't think it's a good idea,\" she said.\n\n\"Have they had a mass destruction of population in every state? No, they have not.\"",

We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nBut with Thitikul prevailing, the world number four will almost certainly need to win for a second time, adding to her Women's PGA Championship triumph in June, to crown her stellar season with the player-of-the-year award.\n\n\"I feel like I did a lot of things well these past four days, despite being really over heated every single day,\" Lee said.\n\n\"I would like to get my driving a little bit cleaner for the next few weeks, but I've been striking it pretty well with my irons and doing pretty well with the putter as well.\n\n\"So going into next week and and CME [the Tour Championship], I think I could bring everything together and hopefully contend in all these weeks as well.\"\n\nAAP",

    "text": "The WA government is facing fresh questions over its plans to boost Perth's tree cover, with experts saying current funding will not come close to delivering on Labor\u2019s election promises.\n\nPrior to the state election, WA Labor promised to almost double Perth's tree canopy from 16 to 30 per cent by 2040.\n\nA pre-election Facebook post from Roger Cook, spruiking a commitment to plant a million trees. (Facebook: Roger Cook)\n\nBut in May it adopted a new approach to calculating canopy which now includes some rural areas, and this saw Perth's canopy figure jump to 22 per cent \u2013 meaning the new goal is an 8 per cent increase, rather than a 14 per cent jump.\n\nThe Western Australian Local Government Association (WALGA) was surprised by the sharp rise in urban canopy, given the city has lost nearly 5,000 trees to the polyphagous shot-hole borer in recent years.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what figure we announce or come up with, we are living in a city that's urban canopy is a disgrace,\" WALGA president Karen Chappel said.\n\nWALGA state president Karen Chappel. (ABC News: Rhiannon Shine)\n\nSarah Allchurch, co-founder of the Western Australian Tree Canopy Advocates (WATCA), was even more scathing.\n\n\"When you start counting paddocks as urban canopy, you're not measuring progress you're actually hiding the problem,\" she said.\n\nMaps showing Perth's urban tree canopy area in 2020 and 2024.

    "text": "Advocacy group Climate Integrity has accused the gas industry of using \"distorted research\", produced by the accounting firm EY, to influence the Australian government's Future Gas Strategy.\n\nFederal government releases its Future Gas Strategy Resources Minister Madeleine King has released the federal government's Future Gas Strategy, saying more natural gas is needed for Australia's energy transition.\n\nIt has asked the competition regulator to investigate whether the Australian Energy Producers (AEP), and by extension EY, made misleading or deceptive claims in its 2023 submission to the government's Future Gas Strategy and in related promotional material.\n\nThe AEP is the peak lobby group for gas and oil producers in Australia.\n\nThe Albanese government's Future Gas Strategy was released in May 2024. It supported a gas expansion in Australia and continued use of gas well beyond 2050.\n\nClimate Integrity says AEP used EY's alleged \"flawed modelling\" in its submission to claim that \"independent analysis confirms new gas supply is needed in all net zero pathways.\"\n\nIt says the AEP's claim contradicts the views of authoritative scientific bodies, internationally and in Australia, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and CSIRO.\n\nIt says AEP has also used that EY modelling to push for new gas fields, pipelines and long-term LNG export contracts.\n\n\"AEP, with the support of EY, produced sophisticated disinformation that misled policymakers and influenced the national climate strategy to expand gas production, and delay the energy transition under the guise of credible analysis,\" said Claire Synder, the director of Climate Integrity.\n\n\"This kind of disinformation is called data washing, and is particularly harmful because it's so hard to spot.\n\n\"It positions itself as an independent technical assessment and uses the language of expertise and the aesthetics of research to embed fossil fuel-friendly narratives deep within the policy making process.\n\n\"The so-called 'independent research' gives vested interests a veil of credibility, which they exploit to lobby parliamentarians and the broader public, distorting the framing of policy debates,\" she said.\n\nAn EY spokesperson told the ABC:\n\n\"Scenario modelling is an assessment of potential future pathways, not a prediction. It incorporates assumptions and judgements that are transparently disclosed for the purposes of debate and discussion. \"EY's modelling in the report referenced clearly discloses our assumptions, scenarios and parameters underpinning the modelling.\"\n\nThe AEP was contacted for comment.\n\nEDO's letter to the regulator\n\nWhen the Albanese government released its Future Gas Strategy in May 2024, some Labor backbenchers said they were \"blindsided\" by the policy's promotion of the gas industry.\n\nLabor backbench 'blindsided' by Albanese gas strategy Labor backbenchers say they were caught off guard by the government's new gas policy, which the resources minister says will keep the fossil fuel in Australia's energy mix until 2050 \"and beyond\".\n\nClimate Integrity says since the Future Gas Strategy was released, the Albanese government has approved 12 major coal and gas projects, and issued nine offshore exploration permits for gas supply, with project lifetime emissions reaching billions of tonnes of C02 equivalent.\n\nIt says that gas expansion directly contradicts the International Energy Agency's Net Zero by 2050 pathway.\n\nClimate Integrity is a not-for-profit advocacy group. It was founded in 2024 to \"increase the ambition, integrity and accountability of the climate commitments of Australian companies.\"\n\nIts team is made up of analysts and climate advocates, supported by a network of experts comprising academics, researchers, lawyers, and civil society leaders.\n\nLast month, the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO), acting on behalf of Climate Integrity, formally asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate some of the claims made by AEP in its submission to the government's Future Gas Strategy, and associated promotional material referencing EY's modelling.\n\nIn its letter to the regulator, the EDO said:\n\nOur client requests that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) investigate whether certain representations made by Australian Energy Producers (AEP) in relation to future East Coast gas demand and the deployment, cost and scalability of Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and its capacity to reduce emissions are misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). In the event that the ACCC finds that AEP contravened s18, our client further requests that the ACCC investigate whether Ernst & Young (EY) was an accessory to AEP's contravention. We note that the ACCC's compliance and enforcement priorities for 2025-2026 includes \"Consumer, fair trading and competition concerns in relation to environmental claims and sustainability with a focus on greenwashing\" and misleading claims in relation to energy.\n\nFuture gas policy must ensure domestic supply In unveiling its Future Gas Strategy, the federal government delivered a political sideshow away from the real conflict that has plagued Australia's economy for years: can we keep enough of the natural gas we already produce on home soil?\n\nThe EY modelling, which is the subject of Climate Integrity's concerns, can be found in the EY report: The future role of natural gas in Australia and the region (November 2023).\n\nThe AEP commissioned EY to produce the report to support the AEP's submission to the government's Future Gas Strategy.\n\nClimate Integrity commissioned the Institute for Sustainable Futures at UTS Sydney to analyse EY's modelling. It also conducted its own analysis of EY's modelling.\n\nThe Environmental Defenders Office, in its letter to the competition regulator, explains Climate Integrity's concerns with EY's modelling.\n\nQuestions about EY's modelling\n\nThe EDO says the AEP also used EY's modelling to make the claim, in a press release in November 2023, that: \"New gas supply needed in all net zero pathways: EY report.\"\n\nThe EDO told the ACCC that was not what the EY modelling said:\n\nEY's report does not conclude that \"new gas supply is needed\" in all net zero pathways. On the contrary, many of the net zero scenarios referenced by EY, including the IEA's Net Zero by 2050 scenario and IPCC Category C1 pathways, project steep declines in gas demand and explicitly state that no new gas fields are required beyond those already approved. Our client is concerned that AEP's statement creates the impression that continued gas expansion is both inevitable and required to meet net zero targets, in circumstances where this is inconsistent with authoritative international modelling. This may mislead policymakers, investors and the public, which may, in turn, undermine the integrity of Australia's public debate on energy and climate policy.\n\nThe EDO told the ACCC that Climate Integrity thinks AEP may be the \"primary contravener\" of Section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law, and EY may be an accessory.\n\nIn relation to the relevant representations being made \"in trade or commerce\", we note that the EY Gas Report was published with the intention of protecting the commercial interests of the natural gas industry. In that regard AEP's media campaign in relation to the Future Gas Strategy promotes that Australia will require substantial gas production to ensure reliable and affordable energy as part of the net zero transition.\n\nClimate Integrity says in EY's modelling, scenarios promoting a significant role for gas through to 2050 are not consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nIt says in 1.5C-aligned models, gas production and use decline substantially, requiring either a complete phase-out or reliance on unproven levels of carbon capture and storage.\n\nAustralia's oil and gas lobby\n\nAEP is the peak body for oil and gas producers in Australia.\n\nOn its website, it says it has about 60 full members who account for 95 per cent of national petroleum production.\n\nGas lobby 'playbook' Analysis by international think tank InfluenceMap has looked at how the gas industry has pushed back against efforts in Victoria to transition away from gas as part of a global campaign to keep households hooked on the fuel.\n\nIt says it also represents about 140 associate members that provide \"a wide range of goods and services to the upstream oil and gas industry\" \u2014 including major consultancies EY, PwC, and KPMG.\n\nClimate Integrity has raised concerns about that relationship between EY with the AEP, wondering about the suitability of EY, as an associate member of the AEP, producing modelling and research for the AEP, on commission, to be used to promote the AEP's interests.\n\nClimate Integrity says it has been talking to EY's leadership about its concerns since June, and it has requested that EY publicly acknowledge the inaccuracies in its modelling.\n\nIt has also asked EY to commit to no longer providing advisory services that support the expansion of fossil fuels, and to drop its AEP membership.\n\nIt says EY has acknowledged Climate Integrity's concerns but has not taken any action.",

    "text": "Pamela Rabe is accustomed to being cast as a \"tight, repressive woman with secrets\".\n\nThe statuesque, Canadian-born actor has carved an impressive place for herself in the Australian theatre and television industries, playing everything from one of the \"great theatre monsters\" to Joan \"The Freak\" Ferguson in Wentworth.\n\n\"I think that other people see that in me because of the way I look, the way I sound,\" Rabe says.\n\n\"And I've kind of resisted that for a time. But later in life, as some of these roles started coming at me in more rapid succession, there's a point where I go, 'oh, f*** it, I'm not going to turn that one down'. They're too much fun.\"\n\nHer latest role, in Melbourne Theatre Company's production of Rebecca, is as the haunting, black-clad housekeeper Mrs Danvers. The character is the source of many of the psychological thrills in the novel written by Daphne du Maurier in 1938, adapted by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940.\n\nPamela Rabe plays three roles in Rebecca \u2014 Danvers, Mrs Van Hopper and Beatrice: \"There was some magic to be had in having a very limited number of bodies in the space who were bringing the past to life.\" (Supplied: Photo by Charlie Kinross)\n\nThe film won the Oscar for Best Picture that year, and Judith Anderson was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her eerie depiction of Mrs Danvers.\n\nRabe has long been fascinated with making Gothic theatre, and had been talking for years with director Anne-Louise Sarks about adapting one of du Maurier's books (the Cornwall author also penned The Birds, adapted by Hitchcock in 1963).\n\nSo Rebecca and the formidable Mrs Danvers were things Rabe relished diving into.\n\n\"There is a kind of iconic nature to the character: she's very still and apparently quite contained and enigmatic,\" she says.\n\n\"They're all characters with secrets. And those are always great things to play.\"\n\nWhat is Rebecca about?\n\nThe titular Rebecca looms large in this story, but the audience never meets her.\n\nShe instead exists as the spectral presence of the former mistress of Manderley estate, after dying in a boating accident the year before.\n\nNow her husband, Maxim de Winter, has brought a new bride back to his grand home. As the unnamed, naive young woman tries to create her place at Manderley, she reckons with the ringing presence of her predecessor.\n\nThis is relentlessly amplified by a cast of characters who all have their own ideas about who Rebecca was \u2014 particularly Mrs Danvers, who used to dote on the former Mrs de Winter.\n\nJudith Anderson's portrayal of Mrs Danvers was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\n\"We all have different versions of [Rebecca], or a pretty clear idea of who we think she is,\" says Rabe.\n\n\"And as the woman is trying to put together the pieces of the jigsaw, she becomes more and more obsessed, really, fascinated and then obsessed, with her new husband's first wife.\"\n\nWhile a fan of the Hitchcock interpretation, director Anne-Louise Sarks (who is also director of the MTC) says it was the du Maurier book from which they most drew.\n\n\"I knew the Hitchcock film. It's a fabulous film, but there are things it doesn't satisfy for me,\" she said in an audience forum after a performance of the show.\n\n\"I was far more interested in getting inside the minds of the women in this story.\"\n\n\"It's a bit on the gloomy side,\" Daphne du Maurier wrote to her publisher, Victor Gollancz, about Rebecca. (Supplied: Hachette)\n\nShe was also determined for more people to understand the genius of the writer, who she says was ahead of her time.\n\n\"I feel like there's a wit and an intelligence to du Maurier that isn't always acknowledged immediately. You know, she was celebrated as a romance writer in the early days of Rebecca being in the world.\"\n\nCast-member Toby Truslove (The Cherry Orchard; Utopia) \u2014 who plays a rotation of three characters: Jack, Frank and Gran \u2014 says reading the book opened the story up for him in a totally different way.\n\n\"The book is so interesting, because you are left with your own choices about who Rebecca is. And who is the woman? You know, are you rooting for her? And what is she complicit in?\"\n\n'A brand new little thing'\n\n\"I brought what I believed on day one was a full draft of the script, and basically from then we started questioning absolutely every line,\" Sarks says.\n\nThe cast of four \u2014 rounded out by an incandescent Nikki Shiels as the unnamed woman and a brooding Steve Phillips as Maxim \u2014 pulled apart, reworked and interrogated each moment of the production. It's something Sarks admitted was \"a slightly mad thing to do on a traditional five-week rehearsal process\".\n\nToby Truslove (right) describes Anne-Louise Sarks (centre) as \"the most honestly, genuinely collaborative director I've ever worked with, who loves the thrill of creating together\". (Supplied: Charlie Kinross)\n\n\"A lot of plays that you get to see have really found their feet in front of an audience \u2014 and obviously the classics have been running many, many times,\" she said.\n\n\"This is a brand new little thing that's just in some ways really came together on opening night.\"\n\nSarks also drew on the monumental talents of set and costume designer Marg Howell, who recently won a Tony Award for her work on The Picture of Dorian Gray.\n\nCounteracting the elaborate, overbearing setting of Manderley in the film, the play set is stripped right back, the cast moving through a kind of black void of the woman's memory, with a brightly lit telephone, dressing table or bed emerging from the gloom.\n\nRabe describes the set \u2014 which also includes an enormous mirror on the ceiling, vines that seem to be alive, and terrifying mannequins \u2014 as \"extraordinary\".\n\n\"It's a psychological world where strange things and wonderful things can happen. What Marg's given us is really magic.\"\n\nMarg Howell (left) and Sarah Snook both won Tony Awards for their work on The Picture of Dorian Gray. (Photo by Jade Greene/WWD via Getty Images)\n\nRebecca in the modern age\n\nThe Hitchcock version of Rebecca was forced to tweak some crucial details at the end of the story, stripping away a particularly dark twist of the novel to satisfy censors at the time.\n\nAnd while the book did not have to adhere to such strict rules, it was still very much influenced by attitudes of the time, particularly towards the behaviour of women.\n\nLoading...\n\nRabe says they are all fascinated with \"embracing the enigma\" of that.\n\n\"This character is a 1930s female, written in the 1930s, and there are certain things Daphne du Maurier perhaps couldn't say or had to be kind of coded,\" she says.\n\n\"So, what happens if you give yourself permission to really open up some questions about that for an audience, about what kind of a woman Rebecca was, and how do you read that behaviour through a 21st-century filter?\"\n\nThe story is also tangled with du Maurier's life at the time, following widespread speculation that Rebecca was based on Jan Ricardo, the ex-fiancee of the writer's husband, Frederick Browning.\n\n\"It's a story about control and power and repression, and an idea about how women are supposed to behave,\" Truslove says. (Supplied: Photo by Charlie Kinross)\n\nIn Tatiana de Rosnay's biography, Manderley Forever, it is said that du Maurier was jealous and fixated on Ricardo, hiding any pictures of her.\n\nTruslove says he watched back interviews with du Maurier, trying to glean what she really thought of Rebecca.\n\n\"She speaks in one way about her and you're like, 'I don't even know if that's true \u2014 the author's lying',\" he says.\n\nRabe gives a half smile.\n\n\"I mean, you do get the feeling that Daphne du Maurier was the second Mrs de Winter \u2026 but she was also Rebecca.\"\n\nRebecca is showing at Melbourne Theatre Company until November 5.",

Fear and algorithms did the rest, with the key indices falling through to the close.\n\nIn a collapse not seen since early April, the S & P 500 dropped 2.7% and the Dow shed 1.9%.\n\nThe tech-centric Nasdaq was the hardest hit, down 3.6% \u2014 Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon and Advanced Micro Devices all fell more than 2% after the bell.\n\nEuropean stocks tanked in a last-minute slide, the broad Eurostoxx600 closed down 1.2%, having hit record highs earlier in the week.\n\nThe global equities index, the MSCI fell more than 2%.\n\nThe ASX 200 looks likely to follow suit with futures trading pointing to a 0.9% decline on opening.\n\nBrent and US crude oil futures fell around 3% to their lowest levels in six months.\n\nUS copper futures fell more than 5%, while soft commodities like US wheat and US soybeans dropped 1.5%.\n\nGold was the exception, with some panicky money sending it back above the $US4,000/ounce level again.\n\n\"The second-largest economy and the first-largest economy are arguing again, and we're seeing a sell first, ask questions later mentality to end the week,\" Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Reuters at the end of a torrid session. \"President Trump's post did truly come out of nowhere, which opened the door for some extreme volatility.\" \"And it's important to remember we haven't had this level of volatility in a long time,\" Mr Detrick added. \"One could argue we were due for some spookiness this October.\"\n\nThe US dollar index fell as did US treasury bond yields, although that didn't support the Aussie dollar, which dropped in the general \"risk-off\" trade.\n\nPerhaps the biggest losers of the session were cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin down more than 8% on Friday and Ethereum down almost 6%.\n\nThe cryptos have since recovered a bit this morning as the temperature in what so far has been just a war of words between the US and China seems to have cooled over the weekend.",

(ABC News: Madeleine Rojahn)\n\nWetlands have been described as \"the Earth's kidneys\" by scientists, or \"blue carbon sinks\", as they filter pollutants from the oceans and air.\n\nThey also act as buffer zones during floods and are biodiversity sanctuaries.\n\nMr Eddington said he had enjoyed the interactions with different people through the project.

    "text": "In recent years, stories about developers enacting sunset clauses and cancelling property contracts \u2014 taking the dreams of would-be buyers with them \u2014 have become increasingly common.\n\nOn the Gold Coast, a group of buyers have claimed \u2014 as others have in the past \u2014 that the developer did so to resell the units at a higher price. The developer has denied the allegations.\n\nThe buyers are in the process of preparing legal action, and want stronger laws introduced.\n\nSamuel Amey lodged a petition with the state government, calling for it to bring its sunset clause legislation in line with other states. ( )\n\nAround the country, state and territories are trying to tighten the rules around when sunset clauses can be used.\n\nWhat are sunset clauses?\n\nSunset clauses are most commonly spoken about in relation to off-the-plan contracts.\n\nA developer tried to cancel dream home contracts, but buyers are fighting it Buyers who bought off-the-plan at a Gold Coast housing development years ago weren't just purchasing a home \u2014 they were purchasing a dream. Now, the developer is trying to cancel their contracts, but they don't want to accept that lying down.\n\nThey set a deadline for when certain conditions, like construction and settlement, needs to be met.\n\nFor buyers, it means they can walk away from a project if it is delayed significantly and their plans change.\n\nAnd developers can cancel if labour shortages bite, construction costs increase or there are other delays, like periods of bad weather.\n\nHousing Industry Association (HIA) Queensland executive director Michael Roberts said in the past few years, construction and labour costs had meant it was taking \"significantly longer\" to get projects out of the ground.\n\nHe said there were also benefits for buyers when getting into an off-the-plan contract.\n\n\"There's definitely a speculative element too for purchasers buying off-the-plan,\" he said.\n\n\"They're buying something at today's price with a fairly high level of confidence that by the time the product is delivered it'll be worth substantially more.\"\n\nThe Housing Industry Association says construction costs have increased in the past few years. ( )\n\nWhy do sunset clauses exist?\n\nThey are intended to protect both buyer and seller, letting either cancel a contract if construction isn't completed and settled before a certain date.\n\nBut, in some cases, they can be misused \u2013allegedly by developers who want to make a larger profit when property values increase.\n\nThat's come to the attention of policy makers.\n\nWhat are the laws like around the country?\n\nSome states have come under more pressure than others to tighten sunset clause laws, meaning the rules differ across jurisdictions.\n\nQueensland The Queensland government is reviewing its sunset clause legislation. ( ) The last significant reform to sunset clause legislation happened in 2023 under the former Labor government. Those changes \u2014 which only applied to contracts for the sale of land \u2014 meant developers could only invoke the sunset clause if they had either the written consent of the buyer or a Supreme Court order. A third situation \"prescribed by regulation\" was also set out. But earlier this year, the LNP government announced it would review sunset clause rules. Public consultation on that review closed on Friday, and the government has faced pressure to extend protections offered to land buyers to all property buyers, including apartment and unit purchasers. New South Wales NSW law sets out limited circumstances for using sunset clauses. ( ) Stricter rules on when sunset clauses can be used were introduced in 2015. They apply to all off-the-plan contracts, including apartments and units. Developers are required to obtain the written consent of every buyer or apply to the New South Wales Supreme Court before enacting the sunset clause. Since 2019, developers have also been required to provide buyers with mandatory disclosure documents. Victoria Victoria has strict sunset clause laws in place. ( ) Under amendments to the law passed in 2019, developers need written consent of the buyer or permission from the Supreme Court. The government said at the time the laws were intended to protect buyers, and in response to concerns about \"developers deliberately postponing the completion of construction work\". ACT The ACT reformed its laws in 2021. ( ) In 2021 the government introduced new laws modelled on those in both Victoria and New South Wales. Under their model, developers have to give buyers 28 days' notice in writing and buyers have to consent to the contract being terminated. If there's no agreement, the matter goes to the Supreme Court, where the developer bears the legal costs. A further review of the laws recommended further changes including a requirement for developers to withhold a percentage of the purchase price to deal with disputes or defects. South Australia The South Australian government is considering reform to its sunset clause laws. ( ) The government has considered strengthening its regulation around sunset clauses in off-the-plan contracts. Consultation closed in January this year and changes are being considered. Western Australia Sunset clauses can be used under Western Australian law by both buyers and sellers. ( ) Sunset clauses can be used under Western Australian law by both buyers and sellers. There's little additional regulation. Tasmania Tasmania has minimal regulation on sunset clauses. ( ) Tasmania has minimal regulation on sunset clauses. Northern Territory The NT has minimal regulation on sunset clauses. ( ) The Northern Territory currently has minimal regulation on sunset clauses. Buyers can cancel contracts if they aren't settled before a specified date without paying a penalty.\n\nWhat else can buyers do?\n\nIn any case, buyers are encouraged to seek independent legal advice.\n\nThat's because sometimes \u2014 even in jurisdictions with tight laws \u2014 there are extra provisions built into contracts which can allow developers to terminate them.\n\nQueensland's Office of Fair Trading recommends buyers seek \"specialist legal advice\" and urges them to beware of the risks associated with buying off-the-plan.\n\nThose risks include not being able to see the final result, unexpected delays in the building process, market price changes and \"contract clauses allowing it to be cancelled\".\n\nBuyers are also urged to maintain \"an open dialogue\" with the developer throughout the process.",

Even Shane Warne would have struggled to spin a ball that far.\n\nIn the face of a big pushback to his plans to impose an additional 15 per cent tax on income generated on super funds with balances of more than $3 million, Chalmers has been forced into an embarrassing retreat.\n\nFirst announced in 2023, Chalmers was not only going to increase the tax paid by 0.5 per cent of people who also happened to be among the nation\u2019s wealthiest and most well-off.\n\nHe was going to tax unrealised gains, effectively the lift in the paper value of assets before the owner was able to sell them, in what would be a huge departure from the way income in this nation is taxed.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers announcing changes to the superannuation tax system at Parliament House. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nHe was also not going to index the $3 million threshold, effectively ensuring young people today would eventually get caught up in his planned tax net.\n\nBoth key elements are now gone. That\u2019s not a tweak \u2013 that\u2019s a wholescale renovation.\n\nHe is sticking his higher tax to real gains while the thresholds will be indexed. And to help cover the cost of his retreats, people with more than $10 million \u2013 about 8000 individuals \u2013 will actually face a 40 per cent tax rate on their holdings.\n\nThe treasurer is also tidying up an issue around the low-income superannuation tax offset and the way it interacts with the revamped stage 3 tax cuts, that would have hurt people earning less than $45,000.\n\nChalmers says the combination of his changes will mean that in 2028-29, instead of earning about $2.5 billion in extra revenue, the government will collect about $2 billion. Further out, by indexing the thresholds, the repair to the long-term budget bottom line is reduced, although he maintains it will still raise a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of cash.\n\nHow \u201csubstantial\u201d that tweak is, only future taxpayers will find out.",

Hale is not a drummer \u2013 he\u2019s a bass guitarist \u2013 but he has found ways to adapt and incorporate these rhythmic traditions into his own playing and compositional practice. Musician Chris Hale Credit: Cesar Rodriguez Hale\u2019s latest project is based on his own personal interpretation of hoh\u016dp, a Korean rhythmic concept based on breath and body movement. But while his study of this elaborate system has academic leanings \u2013 he\u2019s written an entire thesis on it \u2013 the compositions that have emerged from his study are far from abstruse. At JazzLab on Sunday, Hale spoke briefly about his interest in ritual music from Korea, but didn\u2019t mention hoh\u016dp or the related methodology he\u2019d developed for his own music. Instead, he embodied it \u2013 quite literally. We may not have understood or even registered the rhythmic intricacy at play, but we could see and feel the pulsing undulations in Hale\u2019s bass lines and torso. Drummer Simon Barker (also a master of Korean drumming) was equally expressive, resembling a languid cowboy leaning back in his saddle while his arms flew around the kit with explosive power and immaculate control.\n\nMeanwhile, saxophonist Jamie Oehlers and pianist Brett Williams fashioned clear melodic lines and beguiling harmonies to counter the music\u2019s rhythmic complexity. Both could shift from introspective lyricism to muscular vigour with ease, enhancing the music\u2019s emotional impact. Loading Several tunes moved through multiple moods, building from graceful solo or duo introductions to propulsive groove-based themes, dropping into hushed interludes or creating sweeping extended codas that became more soulful, more majestic and more impassioned with every repetition. With Oehlers based in Perth and Barker in Sydney, this is an ensemble that will require considerable commitment to keep together. But this project (like so many of Hale\u2019s creative endeavours) is unique and compelling enough to be worth the effort.

The timing doesn\u2019t help because DanceX is wedged between the Australian Ballet seasons of Prism and Manon. So it doesn\u2019t have much oxygen. It also overlaps with the Melbourne Fringe Festival, with its own diverse program of dance offerings.\n\nAudiences should come anyway. There\u2019s a generous selection of shorter works. The standard is very high \u2013 these are works that have toured repeatedly \u2013 and the contrasts are instructive. It amounts to a welcome digest of where Australian dance is now. A notable international guest, the Royal New Zealand Ballet, offers an excerpt from Te Ao Marama, created for the company\u2019s 70th anniversary by Moss Te Ururangi Patterson. It\u2019s an intriguing experiment in which the haka form is combined with more lyrical material. An excerpt from Te Ao Marama is presented as part of of the first week of DanceX.

Balanchine\u2019s Allegro Brillante is performed by artists from the Australian Ballet and the Australian Ballet School. Charming, yes, and a bit schmaltzy. It\u2019s performed with speed and some feel for the music; nonetheless, it looks a little stale on these dancers.\n\nThe standout piece is Lucy Guerin\u2019s Ground Control. If Samara Merrick is plausible but not dazzling in Allegro, here she is a galvanic phenomenon: focused, precise and attractively strange. She proves an ideal interpreter of Guerin\u2019s art of the uncanny. The four dancers first work themselves into the floor, sinking their feet as the arms flicker. Then there\u2019s shift when Merrick puts on her pointe shoes. Now we see structures melt away as she wafts into the darkness. Lucy Guerin\u2019s Ground Control is a highlight.

Both were popular bestsellers made into Hitchcock films, so it\u2019s fair to ask: what can theatre bring to their retelling that film can\u2019t?\n\nIn Matthew Lutton\u2019s no-frills adaptation of The Birds, the intimacy of sound predominated. Paula Arundell\u2019s almost conspiratorial storytelling coaxed audiences into the claustrophobic monodrama; audio tech immersed us in the horror of unexplained avian attacks individually, creating a private, and deeply unnerving, soundscape for each spectator. Nikki Shiels in a scene from Rebecca Credit: Pia Johnson Anne-Louise Sarks\u2019 Rebecca has frills. This is commercial theatre with elegant production values, poised and atmospheric design, a formidable cast, and a script that allows the seeds of this iconic romantic thriller to bloom into morbid flower. An unnamed young woman (Nikki Shiels) meets grieving aristocrat Maxim de Winter (Stephen Phillips) by chance in Monte Carlo. A whirlwind romance leads to marriage, and she moves with him to Manderley \u2013 a stately manor home by the sea in Cornwall \u2013 where she quickly falls under the shadow of Maxim\u2019s recently deceased first wife, Rebecca. As the severe housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Pamela Rabe) begins to manipulate the new lady of the house, Maxim becomes remote and emotionally withdrawn. All roads point to Rebecca as the cause. Is Maxim still in love with her? How could anyone ever live up to Rebecca\u2019s reputation for feminine perfection? And how, exactly, did Rebecca die?\n\nScandalous revelations and sudden twists await as she probes the secrets her haunted husband is hiding from her. Design elements fuse into a triumph of Gothic sensibility: the brooding insistence of the sound design (Grace Ferguson and Joe Paradise Lui); Paul Jackson\u2019s nimbus-smeared lighting; Marg Horwell\u2019s astute eye for period fashion; and the visual precision behind each scene change, every mist and mirror. Pamela Rabe as Mrs Danvers is ideal casting. Credit: Pia Johnson Shiels inhabits the insecurities of the heroine, her vulnerability, and her descent into domestic horror with compelling presence. There\u2019s a jolting character transformation that might be more credible had it been achieved in a more graduated way, but the romance opposite Phillips holds your attention, and I particularly enjoyed Shiels going toe-to-toe with Rabe. Long before her award-winning role in Wentworth, I\u2019ve wanted to see Rabe as Mrs Danvers. It\u2019s ideal casting, and Rabe\u2019s husky apparition turns into a creature of flesh and blood as it builds a sapphic subtext (disallowed by censors in the Hitchcock movie) to the character\u2019s deranged obsession. The fetishisation of the feminine, and the power play between the two women, has a transfixing, performative quality that reminded me a little of the murderous sisters in Jean Genet\u2019s The Maids.\n\nLoading And it\u2019s Mrs Danvers, interestingly, who gives the staunchest rallying cry regarding social freedom for women. Sarks appears to deny no perspective on the sources of psychological horror in Rebecca, tantalising us with possibilities. It\u2019s thought-provoking, even if they don\u2019t all coalesce into effective drama. Newcomers to Rebecca might strain, too, to make sense of plot twists hastily telegraphed toward the end. It\u2019s a bumpy climax after such a smooth ride to get there, though a small flaw in an otherwise slick, solidly crafted entertainment.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead MUSIC\n\nTrio Isimsiz \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMusica Viva Australia, Melbourne Recital Centre, October 7 Blending youthful verve and bonhomie with seasoned intuition, Trio Isimsiz (Turkish for \u201ctrio without a name\u201d) made this concert deeply pleasurable. Bookended by two great masterpieces (Brahms\u2019 Piano Trio in C minor, Op. 101 and Schubert\u2019s Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat major, D. 898), the program centred on the Melbourne premiere of a new trio by contemporary Spanish composer Francisco Coll.\n\nBrahms\u2019 third and final essay in the piano trio form is highly compact; its four movements last just over 20 minutes. From the start, the trio fanned the music\u2019s smouldering embers of passion into flame, confirming a solid collective commitment to their endeavours. Beautifully hushed playing in the inner movements caught the ear, along with some wonderfully resonant pizzicato before the fiery finale. Commissioned for Trio Isimsiz, Coll describes his 2020 Piano Trio as kaleidoscopic. Moving from textural fragmentation to cohesion and back to fragmentation across its four movements constitutes a form of musical cubism. While an engaging and highly imaginative work, with allusions to Richard Strauss and flamenco, there is perhaps too much reliance on the piano to glue the texture together, apart from one spotlit moment for cello. Nevertheless, the dedicatees convincingly rose to the work\u2019s considerable technical and expressive challenges. Trio Isimiz. Credit: Verena Chen Schubert\u2019s evergreen trio sent the audience out on a high. After revelling in the buoyant optimism of the opening, the players revealed the poignant slow movement as the beating heart of the work, inhaling tenderness and exhaling a gentle melancholy. Deft, delicate touches in the scherzo led to a final rondo full of playful energy. Pianist Erdem Misirlioglu, an astute chamber musician with technique to burn, violinist Pablo Hernan Benedi with his sweet, well-projected tone and cellist Edvard Pogossian\u2019s musical handling of his gloriously rich-sounding instrument have certainly made a name for this \u201cnameless\u201d trio.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe Tallis Scholars \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre, October 5 and 6 Melbourne turned on a rock star welcome for The Tallis Scholars, who, over half a century, have come to epitomise the classic English choral sound.

Credit: Hugo Glendinning Such bounty enabled capacity audiences to savour the group\u2019s stylistic versatility with music from 12th-century abbess and mystic Hildegard von Bingen, through to contemporary American composer Nico Muhly. While some fans may have considered the absence of English music from the Tudor period conspicuous, there was much other fine music from the 15th and 16th centuries to enjoy.\n\nEmma Walshe expertly spun out the glorious high Cs in Gregorio Allegri\u2019s crowd-pleasing Miserere, supported by the group\u2019s customary razor-sharp intonation and limpid diction. Another Tallis Scholars speciality, Tomas Luis de Victoria\u2019s six-part Requiem of 1605, also plumbed great emotional depths. Director Peter Phillips unleashed plenty of Latin fervour in an evocative reading that cut to the heart of this powerful pondering of life and death. Loading Classics such as Clemens non Papa\u2019s Ego flos campi and Josquin\u2019s Praeter rerum seriem rubbed shoulders with lesser-known gems, including Crecquillon\u2019s Andreas Christi famulus, Obrecht\u2019s Salve Regina and an eight-part Credo by Gombert. A sprightly Deus in adiutorium by Spanish Mexican priest Juan de Padilla added further delight. Sung by an angelic quartet of female voices, four short chants by Hildegard provided interludes in the second program. By contrast, works by living composers included Muhly\u2019s 2023 commission A Glorious Creature, full of engaging brightness, while the quiet intensity of Arvo Part\u2019s Triodion and Da pacem Domine were set against the insightful strength of his Magnificat.",

    "text": "Perhaps of more significance than the detail of either side\u2019s complaints of the other\u2019s recent actions, however, is a looming meeting of Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. That meeting, at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, is planned for November 1. It is instructive that Trump\u2019s threatened tariff increase \u2013 on top of the existing effective rate of close to 40 per cent \u2013 wouldn\u2019t occur until November 1, which is the scheduled finishing date for the summit. The core of Beijing\u2019s barrage of new trade restrictions also wouldn\u2019t be implemented until after the summit. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment.\u2019 Donald Trump on Truth Social That could suggest that China is seeking leverage for those discussions, deploying its most powerful trade weapon -- its stranglehold on the critical rare earths sector -- to demonstrate that Xi will be negotiating from a position of strength, rather than one of vulnerability.\n\nIt was China\u2019s imposition of restrictions on rare earths and rare earth magnets to the US earlier this year that caused the Trump administration to walk back their 145 per cent tariff rate on imports from China in April (which China had responded to with a 125 per cent tariff of its own) at the Geneva negotiations. Within days of those restrictions being imposed, US auto companies were shutting down plants. Loading Rare earths and magnets are vital to many industries, most notably defence manufacturers, aircraft manufacturers, chipmakers and auto companies. With China supplying about 70 per cent of the world\u2019s rare earths mining, about 90 per cent of their separation and processing, more than 90 per cent of magnet manufacturing and about 80 per cent of the world\u2019s battery cell production, it has an extraordinary powerful hand to play in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nTrump announced, on social media as usual, his response to China\u2019s actions, after writing that \u201csome very strange things are happening in China! They are becoming very hostile.\u201d Interestingly, though, his response was surprisingly temperate. Asked later what would happen if China unwound the new export controls, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see what happens. That\u2019s why I made it November 1 (after the scheduled meeting).\u201d Trump, who said he would go to South Korea regardless of what China did, also posted another comment that lacked his usual aggression and, indeed, was placatory. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn\u2019t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!.\u201d When Trump announced his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on everyone in April, financial markets revolted and Trump was coerced into deferring their introduction. It took until August before they were in place.\n\nInvestors saw that as an example of the \u201cTACO\u201d trade (short for Trump Always Chickens Out). On Friday, they revolted again, with the US sharemarket down 2.7 per cent (the tech-heavy Nasdaq market was down 3.6 per cent) and shares in tech leaders like Nvidia and AMD hammered. Nvidia was down 5 per cent and AMD 8 per cent. Loading Oil prices fell heavily, the US dollar weakened, US bond yields tumbled and the cryptocurrency market tumbled 11.6 per cent \u2013 initially wiping out nearly $US500 billion of value \u2013 before recovering some of those losses over the weekend. Bitcoin tumbled about 9.5 per cent before recovering nearly half its losses. While Trump thinks China\u2019s economy is vulnerable to US trade sanctions, as it is, China\u2019s exports have held up surprisingly well despite a big slump in exports to America, which were down about 15 per cent in the first eight months of this year. Overall, its exports were up 5.9 per cent, as it exported more to South-East Asia, South America and to Europe.\n\nBeijing also has the ability, which it has so far not exploited, to boost domestic economic activity. Conversely, China knows that the Trump economy is faltering under the weight of the tariffs, with America\u2019s inflation rate rising in tandem with higher unemployment. The US government has been shut down, Trump has threatened (more) mass sackings of government employees and some of the administration\u2019s most high-profile policies are increasingly unpopular. Unlike Xi, Trump has to worry about politics, with next year\u2019s midterm elections creating the prospect that the Democrats could seize control of the House. Trump can threaten higher tariffs (and China can respond with higher tariffs of its own), or more bans on exports of things like semiconductors or aircraft parts, but Xi is insulated from their impacts on his economy.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t (yet?) have the ability to ignore the repercussions of his policies for Americans or the US economy. The reactions of US financial markets are also far more significant for Trump than anything China\u2019s markets might do for Xi. Loading That\u2019s probably why US markets\u2019 response this week could be important. If they bounce back, it will be because investors believe the TACO trade is alive. If they were to continue to slump, the pressure on Trump to revive that trade would mount. In the lead-up to the first face-to-face meeting of Trump and Xi in six years, both sides were manoeuvring for leverage. Trump was (misleadingly) boasting of the strength of the US economy, the power of his tariffs and America\u2019s ability to harm China\u2019s economy.",

They are all levelled to the ground, it is all destruction. I mean I am one of the people who could not get a shirt out of the house. It is destruction that is indescribable, honestly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith aid now able to enter Gaza, reporters on the ground say they've seen over 200 aid trucks unload at the Kerem Shalom crossing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe director of al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza City, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, told Al Jazeera medical facilities have not yet received desperately-needed supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Nations Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher says the next few days will be critical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are so many things that could go wrong in the coming days and weeks, but all of us working on this want to get hostages home, and we want to get masses and masses of aid, a massive influx of aid, into Gaza to save as many lives as possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is due to release the remaining Israeli hostages in the coming hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli officials say not all deceased hostages are expected to be returned on Monday, adding that an 'international body' will be established to locate the remains of those not returned.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it's expected that all 20 living Israeli hostages will be released together.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlana Zeitchik is the relative of living Israeli hostage David Cunio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Really excited. Like I haven't smiled like this in, I mean probably over two years at this point. And I'm also a little nervous, of course. I'm sort of bracing for what will come with it. How he will look, what condition he will be in, we don't really know. So I'm sort of, you know, bracing for that while still remaining really optimistic and hopeful and excited and I can't wait to see him reunited with my cousin and with their children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder US President Donald Trump's proposed plan, once Hamas has handed over the hostages, Israel will begin releasing around 2,000 Palestinian detainees in exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 1,700 of the Palestinians being released by Israel were captured by Israeli forces in the last two years but have not been charged with any crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the exchange, President Trump is expected to address the Israeli Knesset before heading to Egypt where he will co-host a Gaza peace summit with his Egyptian counterpart, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoarding Air Force One, Mr Trump said this deal has made everyone happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is cheering at one time. That's never happened before. Usually if you have one cheering, the other isn't. The other is the opposite. This is the first time everybody is amazed and they're thrilled, and it's an honour to be involved. And we're going to have an amazing time, and it\u2019s going to be something that's never happened before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds gathered to fly both US and Israeli flags, cheering in hopeful anticipation of the hostage release.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of the return, hospitals have prepared long-term rehabilitation capsules.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Noa Eliakim-Riz is the head of returning hostages unit at Rabin Medical Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every returnee has a capsule of caregivers, a doctor, a nurse, a psychosocial worker, a dietician, and they all take care of one returnee and that's the same team that will follow him in the rehabilitation, also. So continuation of care is something very important here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Palestinians in Gaza and abroad however, the news of a ceasefire is bittersweet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the UN Satellite Centre estimating at least 83 per cent of buildings in Gaza are destroyed or damaged, and dozens of bodies already discovered under the rubble in recent days, fears linger about the extent of damage and death in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the US, Palestinian American Mohammad Enayah says the guilt of surviving will stay with him.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "After a bout of trade tensions between the United States and China escalated in recent days, US President Donald Trump has unexpectedly adopted a more conciliatory tone.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a post on the Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi [Jinping] just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump on Friday said he would impose an additional 100 per cent tariff on Chinese goods from 1 November in response to what he called \"extraordinarily aggressive\" new export curbs on China's rare-earth industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had also questioned whether his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea would take place, citing the ongoing trade conflict.\n\n\n\nWhy is Trump softening his approach?\n\nIt remains unclear what prompted Trump to take this softer approach.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Trump hikes tariffs on China by extra 100 per cent, threatens to cancel talks with Xi Jinping\n\nTrump may have had an eye toward to US financial markets on the eve of the new business week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US stock market will be open on Monday local time, although bond markets will close for the Columbus Day holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, the broad S&P 500 stock market index plunged 2.7 per cent, its worst day in about six months after Trump's tariff threat.\n\n\n\nChina accuses Trump of 'double standards'\n\nTrump defended his earlier moves by saying China had sent \"letters to countries all over the world\" announcing export restrictions on rare earths and other materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe described the move as sudden, warning it could paralyse global trade and harm many countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina, in turn, accused the US of acting unfairly, with its commerce ministry calling Trump's tariff threat a \"typical example of 'double standards'\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Trump overcomes 'resistance' from China to transfer TikTok to US investors\n\nThe ministry said the US had ratcheted up economic measures against China since September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right approach to engaging with China,\" it said in an online statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese goods face US tariffs of 30 per cent under the levies Trump imposed while accusing China of aiding in the fentanyl trade as well as unfair trade practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina's retaliatory tariffs are currently at 10 per cent.\n\n\n\nWhy are rare earths the focal point in China-US trade war?\n\nRare earths have been a major sticking point in recent trade negotiations between the two superpowers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are critical to manufacturing everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to military hardware and renewable energy technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina produces over 90 per cent of the world's processed rare earths and rare earth magnets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 17 rare earths are vital materials in products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars.\n\n\n\nExports of 12 of them are restricted after China's commerce ministry on Thursday added five \u2014 holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium \u2014 along with related materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commerce ministry statement sought to reassure foreign companies spooked by the latest export curbs, promising to promote compliant trade by granting general-purpose licenses and license exemptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China's export controls are not export bans,\" it said. \"Any export applications for civilian use that comply with regulations will be approved, and relevant enterprises need not worry.\"\n\n\n\n",

They were using medical terms, they weren't really... it didn't feel very nurturing or caring.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite receiving care at a private Sydney hospital and experiencing complications in a surgery to remove her foetus, Sarah says she wasn't directed to any support services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a First Nations woman, Sarah says she also wasn't directed to any Aboriginal health workers or community.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until she had her son this year, that Sarah was connected with an Aboriginal community health nurse, who directed her to mental health support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI actually never received any follow-up from the hospital. I was never offered any guidance in terms of who I could turn to. The only reason that I was able to reach out to whoever I did in this instance, the pink elephants, was because of my boss at work who had gone through a similar situation a couple years before me. I was never guided in any sort of First Nations practice or connected with any of my community. I wasn't directed in any sort of way in relation to First Nations matters, especially relating to grief. It was quite hard. Again, I felt really alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah's not alone in her experience - in fact according to the Royal Australian New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, or RANZCOG, around 1 in 4 pregnancies result in miscarriage.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a new report by miscarriage support organisation Pink Elephants highlights ongoing gaps in national data on miscarriage.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also found that 75% of women report feeling unsupported following a miscarriage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are discrepancies in identifying overall how many women experience miscarriage, with women's health organisation Jean Hailes suggesting the figure could actually be as high as 37%.\n\n\n\n\n\nPink Elephants' Chief Executive Samantha Payne says a lack of data leads to gaps in quality care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know that for too long our miscarriages have not been seen because they are not counted anywhere nationally, that it's a fragmented health system, and because miscarriage can be managed by a GP which comes under a public health network and national support, or it can be managed by a hospital which comes under state and local health districts and state governments. And then there has been no overarching collection of the data, of the number of losses, the type of early pregnancy losses - because there are different types - the call, the intersectionality data, the geographic locations. And when we don't measure, we don't count, we don't resource and we don't support.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is particularly acute for women in regional and rural parts of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nKatrina Ward, or Treen, is a Ngiyampaa woman and Chief operations manager for the Brewarrina and Walgett Aboriginal Medical Services in Far Northwest New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says there simply aren't enough health workers to provide a continuity of care for women in regional Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have drive in, drive out services, fly in, fly out for the allied health. Even our midwife who comes across from Burke, it's a hundred kilometers away. She comes over every two or three weeks. So a lot, all that education and awareness coming into pregnancy, it's all lost. So then people aren't aware of what to expect and then they've also reliant on family members and other significant people in their life to help them through that process.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTreen says women in regional areas are forced to travel hours to their nearest hospital where they're treated as a number, and often discharged prematurely due to a lack of staffing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedical practices around pregnancy loss can trigger intergenerational trauma connected to the Stolen Generations, as Treen describes, with many First Nations women reporting experiences of racism at hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the government needs to invest in rural and regional health services if they want to close the gap by 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah government's starting to change attitude slightly, but it's a long-term process. And until they're very committed to investing into rural and remote health. At the end of the day these are people's lives. This is their wellbeing. And if you're going to represent the communities within government, we'll do it. Fair income, we're all individuals. We all deserve equality. It doesn't matter where we live. We all deserve the choice to have a good life. So start investing into the people who are the grassroots of Australia, and that's our First Nations people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Payne says her organisation and other stakeholders have been working with the government to address a data gap, following their $1 million investment in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to improve data on miscarriage in May last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was part of the government's $9.5 million funding package towards miscarriage support, which also included investment in bereavement support services, education and awareness, and an audit of Early Pregnancy Assessment Service clinics.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Payne hopes to see a national database by mid next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo commissioned by the Albanese government, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare have actually just published their first review of the sexual and reproductive health framework, which is inclusive of a national pregnancy loss register. And Pink Elephants wholeheartedly supports this initiative. So that will be data that's entered by health professionals.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Assistant Minister for Women Rebecca White told SBS that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has been funded to undertake a miscarriage data scoping study to establish existing and potential data sources and options for national collection of miscarriage data, with public consultation open till November 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minister added that where possible the AIHW publishes data disaggregated for First Nations, and culturally and linguistically diverse people, and by geographic areas, and will be further considered during the development of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the government has not committed to including miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in the census.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Payne says the Australian Bureau of Statistics rejected Pink Elephants' request in September 2023 for this data to be included in the 2026 census.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe gap still for us is the census because there is so much validation in being able to acknowledge your own baby as part of your family within the census. And when we don't give women that option, we're basically saying that your baby doesn't matter. Your loss wasn't real and that's not okay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian Bureau of Statistics told SBS that during the topic review process for the 2026 Census, the topic of 'pregnancy loss' did not progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement said that while the area was initially considered, it did not meet the criteria to progress as it was deemed the data need is partially met by alternative data sources, such as the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah says she would also like to see miscarriage documented in the Census, as there is currently nothing to recognise the loss with the exception of a commemorative certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe would also like to see a specialised bereavement liaison attached to hospitals to connect women with the appropriate services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI would just like to see there be an offer for that first Nations bereavement process, the way that it's sort of ignored at the moment or just forgotten about. I think it's quite important to definitely nurture women during that really vulnerable time, but also to nurture their culture as well. I think you can't have one without the other. You definitely need to nurture their culture but also nurture their mental wellbeing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Nisha Khot is president of the Royal Australian New Zealand College of Obstetricians, and contributed as an expert to the Pink Elephants report.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe believes national data is also important for informing prevention of miscarriages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMiscarriage has traditionally been one of those conditions that hasn't had as much attention paid to it. And also for many years there has been this kind of narrative that miscarriage is something we can't prevent. We can't do anything about it. So is there any point in capturing the data perhaps? But now we know that there are things that we can do and that there are certain conditions that we should look into to prevent miscarriages. And so that is also driving this need to capture the data so we can actually do something about it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe supports the report's recommendations, but notes that midwifery continuity of care could be expanded to include a more holistic range of health workers best suited to the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's important to recognise that actually if somebody who is having a miscarriage needs to have, for example, a surgical procedure, then they do need to have a medical person involved in their care. And so having continuity of care, which is team-based, where there are midwives as well as doctors, providing that continuity within the team makes a lot of sense because ultimately women who need, for example, testing if they're having recurrent miscarriages, women who need surgical procedures that will need a medical person. So it makes sense to have a team continuity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside prevention, Treen explains how comprehensive data is required to resource regional areas and upskill Aboriginal health workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOften when people are away, they're faced with racism as well. You're already tarred with a negative brush and that plays into it. So that's more likely for people to remain silent. But I just feel if we've got someone who they feel, if we can build those relationships early and whether it's Aboriginal health workers or just someone with compassionate and they're able to go through the whole journey with them, then they've got someone they can turn to and then we can rely more on allied health services. But then if we can try and upskill our people on the ground as well, to be able to just have those yarns with people and feel comfortable in talking to 'em about it and then identifying who might be the best appropriate service, what that person could access some more support.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah wishes she had experienced continuity of care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, so I had a different midwife every, I believe, maybe eight hours. I was in hospital for three days, so I was constantly repeating my story, constantly having to explain why I was there, constantly having to meet new people and retell my story. It was like reliving the worst day of my life over and over and over again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe would like to see more care and support extended to women after experiencing a miscarriage.\n\n\n\n",

Sixty-eight per cent received no support when told their pregnancy had ended.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report said one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, but noted research from Jean Hailes and the National Women's Health Survey which suggests that rate might be as high as 37 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nPink Elephants' chief executive, Samantha Payne, estimates the real numbers to be much higher \u2014 but says it's difficult to capture the true scope of miscarriage as there's no national data collection on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For too long, our miscarriages have not been seen because they are not counted anywhere nationally,\" she told SBS. \"It's a fragmented health system.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO New data sheds light on the mental health impacts of losing a pregnancy SBS News 03:33 English\n\nThe absence of national data means it's difficult to understand exactly who's affected most by it \u2014 how many losses there have been, what type of miscarriages they were, what intersectional groups are affected, and where they're located.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange advocates argue this means resources might not be getting to where they're needed most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we don't measure, we don't count, we don't resource, and we don't support,\" Payne said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report offers five recommendations \u2014 including the establishment of national data collection systems, early pregnancy loss care standards, continuity of care, and culturally-safe care.\n\n\n\nFirst Nations women 'left behind'\n\nThe sting is particularly acute for women in regional and rural parts of Australia, where pain is compounded by both geographical and financial barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nKatrina Ward, or Treen, is a Ngiyampaa woman and chief operations manager for the Brewarrina and Walgett Aboriginal Medical Services in far northwest New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreen says women in regional areas are forced to travel hours to their nearest hospital, where they're treated as a number, and often discharged prematurely due to a lack of staffing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Often after a miscarriage, they may have to go to a larger regional centre to have a D&C [surgery to remove the foetus], so that's another layer of trauma on the individual,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Hysterical\n\nTreen says that in regional areas, continuity of care is particularly significant and it's especially so for First Nations communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cultural protocols come into play as well \u2014 they need to feel culturally safe and listened to \u2026 so that if the mother says something's not quite right, it's not dismissed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she says there simply isn't enough resourcing allocated in regional Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says some of her staff \u2014 who live as far as 100 kilometres away \u2014 operate on a \"fly-in, fly-out\" basis, which makes continuity of care and education difficult.

Source: AP / Frank Wiese Her star-making performances in the 1970s, many of which were in Woody Allen films, were not a flash in the pan either, and she would continue to charm new generations for decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe played a businessperson who unexpectedly inherits an infant in Baby Boom, the mother of the bride in the beloved remake of Father of the Bride, a newly single woman in The First Wives Club, and a divorced playwright who gets involved with Jack Nicholson's music executive in Something's Gotta Give.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeaton won an Oscar for Annie Hall in 1978 and would go on to be nominated three more times, for Reds, Marvin's Room and Something's Gotta Give.\n\n\n\nDiane Keaton partnered with Jack Nicholson (centre) in Something's Gotta Give - her favourite film. Source: AP / Jan Bauer Keaton was born Diane Hall in January 1946 in Los Angeles and was drawn to theatre and singing while in school.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe dropped out of college after a year to make a go of it in Manhattan. Actors' Equity already had a Diane Hall in their ranks, and she took Keaton, her mother's maiden name, as her own.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe started on the stage as an understudy in the Broadway production for Hair, and in Allen' s Play It Again, Sam in 1968, for which she would receive a Tony nomination.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeaton made her film debut in the 1970 romantic comedy Lovers and Other Strangers, but her big breakthrough would come a few years later when she was cast in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, which won best picture and become one of the most beloved films of all time.\n\n\n\nShe won a best actress Oscar for playing the title role in the Woody Allen comedy Annie Hall. Source: AP / Chris Pizzello The 1970s were an incredibly fruitful time for Keaton thanks in part to her ongoing collaboration with Allen in both comedic and dramatic roles. She appeared in Sleeper, Love and Death, Interiors, Manhattan, Manhattan Murder Mystery and the film version of Play it Again, Sam.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllen gave Keaton one of her most iconic roles in Annie Hall, the infectious woman from Chippewa Falls whom Allen's Alvy Singer cannot get over. The film is considered one of the great romantic comedies of all time, with Keaton's eccentric, self-deprecating Annie at its heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the New York Times, critic Vincent Canby wrote, \"As Annie Hall, Miss Keaton emerges as Woody Allen's Liv Ullman. His camera finds beauty and emotional resources that somehow escape the notice of other directors. Her Annie Hall is a marvellous nut\".\n\n\n\n\n\nKeaton and Allen were also in a romantic relationship, from about 1968, when she met him while auditioning for his play, until about 1974. Afterward they remained collaborators and friends.\n\n\n\n\"He was so hip, with his thick glasses and cool suits,\" Keaton wrote in her memoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it was his manner that got me, his way of gesturing, his hands, his coughing and looking down in a self-deprecating way while he told jokes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was also romantically linked to Al Pacino, who played her husband in The Godfather, and Warren Beatty who directed her and whom she co-starred with in Reds. She never married but did adopt two children when she was in her 50s: a daughter, Dexter, and a son, Duke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I figured the only way to realise my number-one dream of becoming an actual Broadway musical comedy star was to remain an adoring daughter. Loving a man, a man, and becoming a wife, would have to be put aside,\" she wrote in the memoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The names changed, from Dave to Woody, then Warren, and finally Al. Could I have made a lasting commitment to them? Hard to say. Subconsciously I must have known it could never work, and because of this they'd never get in the way of achieving my dreams.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the remake of Father of the Bride, Keaton and Steve Martin played the flustered parents to the bride which would become a big hit and spawn a sequel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Something's Gotta Give in 2003 she begins a relationship with a playboy womaniser, played by Jack Nicholson, while also being pursued by a younger doctor, played by Keanu Reeves.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer character Erica Barry, with her beautiful Hamptons home and ivory outfits was a key inspiration for the recent costal grandmother fashion trend. It earned her what would be her last Oscar nomination and, later, she'd call it her favourite film.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeaton continued working steadily throughout the 2000s, with notable roles in The Family Stone, as a dying matriarch reluctant to give her ring to her son, in Morning Glory, as a morning news anchor, and the Book Club films.\n\n\n\n",

Even Shane Warne would have struggled to spin a ball that far.\n\nIn the face of a big pushback to his plans to impose an additional 15 per cent tax on income generated on super funds with balances of more than $3 million, Chalmers has been forced into an embarrassing retreat.\n\nFirst announced in 2023, Chalmers was not only going to increase the tax paid by 0.5 per cent of people who also happened to be among the nation\u2019s wealthiest and most well-off.\n\nHe was going to tax unrealised gains, effectively the lift in the paper value of assets before the owner was able to sell them, in what would be a huge departure from the way income in this nation is taxed.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers announcing changes to the superannuation tax system at Parliament House. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nHe was also not going to index the $3 million threshold, effectively ensuring young people today would eventually get caught up in his planned tax net.\n\nBoth key elements are now gone. That\u2019s not a tweak \u2013 that\u2019s a wholescale renovation.\n\nHe is sticking his higher tax to real gains while the thresholds will be indexed. And to help cover the cost of his retreats, people with more than $10 million \u2013 about 8000 individuals \u2013 will actually face a 40 per cent tax rate on their holdings.\n\nThe treasurer is also tidying up an issue around the low-income superannuation tax offset and the way it interacts with the revamped stage 3 tax cuts, that would have hurt people earning less than $45,000.\n\nChalmers says the combination of his changes will mean that in 2028-29, instead of earning about $2.5 billion in extra revenue, the government will collect about $2 billion. Further out, by indexing the thresholds, the repair to the long-term budget bottom line is reduced, although he maintains it will still raise a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of cash.\n\nHow \u201csubstantial\u201d that tweak is, only future taxpayers will find out.",

Hale is not a drummer \u2013 he\u2019s a bass guitarist \u2013 but he has found ways to adapt and incorporate these rhythmic traditions into his own playing and compositional practice. Musician Chris Hale Credit: Cesar Rodriguez Hale\u2019s latest project is based on his own personal interpretation of hoh\u016dp, a Korean rhythmic concept based on breath and body movement. But while his study of this elaborate system has academic leanings \u2013 he\u2019s written an entire thesis on it \u2013 the compositions that have emerged from his study are far from abstruse. At JazzLab on Sunday, Hale spoke briefly about his interest in ritual music from Korea, but didn\u2019t mention hoh\u016dp or the related methodology he\u2019d developed for his own music. Instead, he embodied it \u2013 quite literally. We may not have understood or even registered the rhythmic intricacy at play, but we could see and feel the pulsing undulations in Hale\u2019s bass lines and torso. Drummer Simon Barker (also a master of Korean drumming) was equally expressive, resembling a languid cowboy leaning back in his saddle while his arms flew around the kit with explosive power and immaculate control.\n\nMeanwhile, saxophonist Jamie Oehlers and pianist Brett Williams fashioned clear melodic lines and beguiling harmonies to counter the music\u2019s rhythmic complexity. Both could shift from introspective lyricism to muscular vigour with ease, enhancing the music\u2019s emotional impact. Loading Several tunes moved through multiple moods, building from graceful solo or duo introductions to propulsive groove-based themes, dropping into hushed interludes or creating sweeping extended codas that became more soulful, more majestic and more impassioned with every repetition. With Oehlers based in Perth and Barker in Sydney, this is an ensemble that will require considerable commitment to keep together. But this project (like so many of Hale\u2019s creative endeavours) is unique and compelling enough to be worth the effort.

Seeing Through Darkness. Credit: Matt Byrne And yet, it doesn\u2019t feel like a festival. There\u2019s not a lot of buzz and the Playhouse was far from full at Wednesday\u2019s opening. The timing doesn\u2019t help because DanceX is wedged between the Australian Ballet seasons of Prism and Manon. So it doesn\u2019t have much oxygen. It also overlaps with the Melbourne Fringe Festival, with its own diverse program of dance offerings.\n\nAudiences should come anyway. There\u2019s a generous selection of shorter works. The standard is very high \u2013 these are works that have toured repeatedly \u2013 and the contrasts are instructive. It amounts to a welcome digest of where Australian dance is now. A notable international guest, the Royal New Zealand Ballet, offers an excerpt from Te Ao Marama, created for the company\u2019s 70th anniversary by Moss Te Ururangi Patterson. It\u2019s an intriguing experiment in which the haka form is combined with more lyrical material. An excerpt from Te Ao Marama is presented as part of of the first week of DanceX. Credit: Stephen A\u2019Court Restless Dance Theatre\u2019s Seeing Through Darkness is welcome programming. The company\u2019s inclusive ensemble is accompanied by live violin and cello. It\u2019s the most polished work I\u2019ve seen from them, but it still left me wishing the company would take a few more risks. Balanchine\u2019s Allegro Brillante is performed by artists from the Australian Ballet and the Australian Ballet School. Charming, yes, and a bit schmaltzy. It\u2019s performed with speed and some feel for the music; nonetheless, it looks a little stale on these dancers.\n\nThe standout piece is Lucy Guerin\u2019s Ground Control. If Samara Merrick is plausible but not dazzling in Allegro, here she is a galvanic phenomenon: focused, precise and attractively strange. She proves an ideal interpreter of Guerin\u2019s art of the uncanny. The four dancers first work themselves into the floor, sinking their feet as the arms flicker. Then there\u2019s shift when Merrick puts on her pointe shoes. Now we see structures melt away as she wafts into the darkness. Lucy Guerin\u2019s Ground Control is a highlight. Credit: Kate Longley The evening closes with an excerpt from Dancenorth\u2019s Wayfinder \u2013 that effervescent rainbow fantasy from Townsville.

Both were popular bestsellers made into Hitchcock films, so it\u2019s fair to ask: what can theatre bring to their retelling that film can\u2019t?\n\nIn Matthew Lutton\u2019s no-frills adaptation of The Birds, the intimacy of sound predominated. Paula Arundell\u2019s almost conspiratorial storytelling coaxed audiences into the claustrophobic monodrama; audio tech immersed us in the horror of unexplained avian attacks individually, creating a private, and deeply unnerving, soundscape for each spectator. Nikki Shiels in a scene from Rebecca Credit: Pia Johnson Anne-Louise Sarks\u2019 Rebecca has frills. This is commercial theatre with elegant production values, poised and atmospheric design, a formidable cast, and a script that allows the seeds of this iconic romantic thriller to bloom into morbid flower. An unnamed young woman (Nikki Shiels) meets grieving aristocrat Maxim de Winter (Stephen Phillips) by chance in Monte Carlo. A whirlwind romance leads to marriage, and she moves with him to Manderley \u2013 a stately manor home by the sea in Cornwall \u2013 where she quickly falls under the shadow of Maxim\u2019s recently deceased first wife, Rebecca. As the severe housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Pamela Rabe) begins to manipulate the new lady of the house, Maxim becomes remote and emotionally withdrawn. All roads point to Rebecca as the cause. Is Maxim still in love with her? How could anyone ever live up to Rebecca\u2019s reputation for feminine perfection? And how, exactly, did Rebecca die?\n\nScandalous revelations and sudden twists await as she probes the secrets her haunted husband is hiding from her. Design elements fuse into a triumph of Gothic sensibility: the brooding insistence of the sound design (Grace Ferguson and Joe Paradise Lui); Paul Jackson\u2019s nimbus-smeared lighting; Marg Horwell\u2019s astute eye for period fashion; and the visual precision behind each scene change, every mist and mirror. Pamela Rabe as Mrs Danvers is ideal casting. Credit: Pia Johnson Shiels inhabits the insecurities of the heroine, her vulnerability, and her descent into domestic horror with compelling presence. There\u2019s a jolting character transformation that might be more credible had it been achieved in a more graduated way, but the romance opposite Phillips holds your attention, and I particularly enjoyed Shiels going toe-to-toe with Rabe. Long before her award-winning role in Wentworth, I\u2019ve wanted to see Rabe as Mrs Danvers. It\u2019s ideal casting, and Rabe\u2019s husky apparition turns into a creature of flesh and blood as it builds a sapphic subtext (disallowed by censors in the Hitchcock movie) to the character\u2019s deranged obsession. The fetishisation of the feminine, and the power play between the two women, has a transfixing, performative quality that reminded me a little of the murderous sisters in Jean Genet\u2019s The Maids.\n\nLoading And it\u2019s Mrs Danvers, interestingly, who gives the staunchest rallying cry regarding social freedom for women. Sarks appears to deny no perspective on the sources of psychological horror in Rebecca, tantalising us with possibilities. It\u2019s thought-provoking, even if they don\u2019t all coalesce into effective drama. Newcomers to Rebecca might strain, too, to make sense of plot twists hastily telegraphed toward the end. It\u2019s a bumpy climax after such a smooth ride to get there, though a small flaw in an otherwise slick, solidly crafted entertainment.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead MUSIC\n\nTrio Isimsiz \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMusica Viva Australia, Melbourne Recital Centre, October 7 Blending youthful verve and bonhomie with seasoned intuition, Trio Isimsiz (Turkish for \u201ctrio without a name\u201d) made this concert deeply pleasurable. Bookended by two great masterpieces (Brahms\u2019 Piano Trio in C minor, Op. 101 and Schubert\u2019s Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat major, D. 898), the program centred on the Melbourne premiere of a new trio by contemporary Spanish composer Francisco Coll.\n\nBrahms\u2019 third and final essay in the piano trio form is highly compact; its four movements last just over 20 minutes. From the start, the trio fanned the music\u2019s smouldering embers of passion into flame, confirming a solid collective commitment to their endeavours. Beautifully hushed playing in the inner movements caught the ear, along with some wonderfully resonant pizzicato before the fiery finale. Commissioned for Trio Isimsiz, Coll describes his 2020 Piano Trio as kaleidoscopic. Moving from textural fragmentation to cohesion and back to fragmentation across its four movements constitutes a form of musical cubism. While an engaging and highly imaginative work, with allusions to Richard Strauss and flamenco, there is perhaps too much reliance on the piano to glue the texture together, apart from one spotlit moment for cello. Nevertheless, the dedicatees convincingly rose to the work\u2019s considerable technical and expressive challenges. Trio Isimiz. Credit: Verena Chen Schubert\u2019s evergreen trio sent the audience out on a high. After revelling in the buoyant optimism of the opening, the players revealed the poignant slow movement as the beating heart of the work, inhaling tenderness and exhaling a gentle melancholy. Deft, delicate touches in the scherzo led to a final rondo full of playful energy. Pianist Erdem Misirlioglu, an astute chamber musician with technique to burn, violinist Pablo Hernan Benedi with his sweet, well-projected tone and cellist Edvard Pogossian\u2019s musical handling of his gloriously rich-sounding instrument have certainly made a name for this \u201cnameless\u201d trio.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe Tallis Scholars \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre, October 5 and 6 Melbourne turned on a rock star welcome for The Tallis Scholars, who, over half a century, have come to epitomise the classic English choral sound. Possibly because of the Elisabeth Murdoch Hall\u2019s warm acoustics, the city is the only stop on this Australian tour, favoured with two concerts by the revered ensemble. The Tallis Scholars. Credit: Hugo Glendinning Such bounty enabled capacity audiences to savour the group\u2019s stylistic versatility with music from 12th-century abbess and mystic Hildegard von Bingen, through to contemporary American composer Nico Muhly. While some fans may have considered the absence of English music from the Tudor period conspicuous, there was much other fine music from the 15th and 16th centuries to enjoy.\n\nEmma Walshe expertly spun out the glorious high Cs in Gregorio Allegri\u2019s crowd-pleasing Miserere, supported by the group\u2019s customary razor-sharp intonation and limpid diction. Another Tallis Scholars speciality, Tomas Luis de Victoria\u2019s six-part Requiem of 1605, also plumbed great emotional depths. Director Peter Phillips unleashed plenty of Latin fervour in an evocative reading that cut to the heart of this powerful pondering of life and death. Loading Classics such as Clemens non Papa\u2019s Ego flos campi and Josquin\u2019s Praeter rerum seriem rubbed shoulders with lesser-known gems, including Crecquillon\u2019s Andreas Christi famulus, Obrecht\u2019s Salve Regina and an eight-part Credo by Gombert. A sprightly Deus in adiutorium by Spanish Mexican priest Juan de Padilla added further delight. Sung by an angelic quartet of female voices, four short chants by Hildegard provided interludes in the second program. By contrast, works by living composers included Muhly\u2019s 2023 commission A Glorious Creature, full of engaging brightness, while the quiet intensity of Arvo Part\u2019s Triodion and Da pacem Domine were set against the insightful strength of his Magnificat.",

    "text": "Perhaps of more significance than the detail of either side\u2019s complaints of the other\u2019s recent actions, however, is a looming meeting of Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. That meeting, at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, is planned for November 1. It is instructive that Trump\u2019s threatened tariff increase \u2013 on top of the existing effective rate of close to 40 per cent \u2013 wouldn\u2019t occur until November 1, which is the scheduled finishing date for the summit. The core of Beijing\u2019s barrage of new trade restrictions also wouldn\u2019t be implemented until after the summit. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment.\u2019 Donald Trump on Truth Social That could suggest that China is seeking leverage for those discussions, deploying its most powerful trade weapon -- its stranglehold on the critical rare earths sector -- to demonstrate that Xi will be negotiating from a position of strength, rather than one of vulnerability.\n\nIt was China\u2019s imposition of restrictions on rare earths and rare earth magnets to the US earlier this year that caused the Trump administration to walk back their 145 per cent tariff rate on imports from China in April (which China had responded to with a 125 per cent tariff of its own) at the Geneva negotiations. Within days of those restrictions being imposed, US auto companies were shutting down plants. Loading Rare earths and magnets are vital to many industries, most notably defence manufacturers, aircraft manufacturers, chipmakers and auto companies. With China supplying about 70 per cent of the world\u2019s rare earths mining, about 90 per cent of their separation and processing, more than 90 per cent of magnet manufacturing and about 80 per cent of the world\u2019s battery cell production, it has an extraordinary powerful hand to play in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nTrump announced, on social media as usual, his response to China\u2019s actions, after writing that \u201csome very strange things are happening in China! They are becoming very hostile.\u201d Interestingly, though, his response was surprisingly temperate. Asked later what would happen if China unwound the new export controls, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see what happens. That\u2019s why I made it November 1 (after the scheduled meeting).\u201d Trump, who said he would go to South Korea regardless of what China did, also posted another comment that lacked his usual aggression and, indeed, was placatory. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn\u2019t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!.\u201d When Trump announced his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on everyone in April, financial markets revolted and Trump was coerced into deferring their introduction. It took until August before they were in place.\n\nInvestors saw that as an example of the \u201cTACO\u201d trade (short for Trump Always Chickens Out). On Friday, they revolted again, with the US sharemarket down 2.7 per cent (the tech-heavy Nasdaq market was down 3.6 per cent) and shares in tech leaders like Nvidia and AMD hammered. Nvidia was down 5 per cent and AMD 8 per cent. Loading Oil prices fell heavily, the US dollar weakened, US bond yields tumbled and the cryptocurrency market tumbled 11.6 per cent \u2013 initially wiping out nearly $US500 billion of value \u2013 before recovering some of those losses over the weekend. Bitcoin tumbled about 9.5 per cent before recovering nearly half its losses. While Trump thinks China\u2019s economy is vulnerable to US trade sanctions, as it is, China\u2019s exports have held up surprisingly well despite a big slump in exports to America, which were down about 15 per cent in the first eight months of this year. Overall, its exports were up 5.9 per cent, as it exported more to South-East Asia, South America and to Europe.\n\nBeijing also has the ability, which it has so far not exploited, to boost domestic economic activity. Conversely, China knows that the Trump economy is faltering under the weight of the tariffs, with America\u2019s inflation rate rising in tandem with higher unemployment. The US government has been shut down, Trump has threatened (more) mass sackings of government employees and some of the administration\u2019s most high-profile policies are increasingly unpopular. Unlike Xi, Trump has to worry about politics, with next year\u2019s midterm elections creating the prospect that the Democrats could seize control of the House. Trump can threaten higher tariffs (and China can respond with higher tariffs of its own), or more bans on exports of things like semiconductors or aircraft parts, but Xi is insulated from their impacts on his economy.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t (yet?) have the ability to ignore the repercussions of his policies for Americans or the US economy. The reactions of US financial markets are also far more significant for Trump than anything China\u2019s markets might do for Xi. Loading That\u2019s probably why US markets\u2019 response this week could be important. If they bounce back, it will be because investors believe the TACO trade is alive. If they were to continue to slump, the pressure on Trump to revive that trade would mount. In the lead-up to the first face-to-face meeting of Trump and Xi in six years, both sides were manoeuvring for leverage. Trump was (misleadingly) boasting of the strength of the US economy, the power of his tariffs and America\u2019s ability to harm China\u2019s economy.",
